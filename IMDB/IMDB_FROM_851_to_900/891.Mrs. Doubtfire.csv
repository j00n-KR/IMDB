0,MartinHafer,An uncomfortable mix of broad comedy and pathos....,4,26 May 2012,"A woman (Sally Field) wants 'to find herself' and decides to divorce a seemingly nice husband (Robin Williams). Not content with only this, she tries her darnedest to separate her kids from their loving father. So, in order to be with them, the dad decides to go in drag--dressing up like an old British nanny. Hilarity ensues.I know I am in the distinct minority on this one, but when I saw ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" I disliked it--and so did my wife. As we both sat in the theater, we heard folks laughing and they seemed to like it. We just felt it was incredibly depressing and not particularly enjoyable. The problem is that for us, combining very broad cross-dressing comedy with a ""Kramer Versus Kramer"" plot did not work in the least. Instead of laughing at Williams' exploits, we found ourselves stuck--focusing on the selfishness of the wife and wondering if any SANE person would do what Williams did in order to see his kids (the answer, by the way, is clearly NO). It also came off as a bit creepy. So, you have a selfish wife, a goofy husband and a plot that is utterly ridiculous--and a recipe for a film that we found very hard to like.By the way, I am no Robin Williams fan but he did a good job with the material he was given.",Mrs. Doubtfire
1,TheLittleSongbird,Hilarious and touching- a must see!,9,13 April 2010,"What a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I really like Robin Williams, an actor that is I personally don't care for him that much as a comedian, and the roles of Daniel Hillard and Mrs Doubtfire were perfect for him. While he was fine as Daniel, it is his tour-de-force performance of Mrs Doubtfire that drives the film. Plus the make up used on him was fantastic. Also worthy of credit is director Chris Columbus, who nails the use of Williams's exuberance and quick-fire personality, and because of this every gag hits the right buttons. There are cracking set pieces such as the make up experiments and the series of table hopping quick changes. And I for one liked the routine with the dinosaur, it wasn't one of the better gags but it was funny. Pierce Brosnan also does surprisingly well as the bachelor looking for a ready-made family, and Mara Wilson gives one of her better performances as Natalie, very delightful and charming her performance was. The script is also funny and touching, the score is warm and sweet and the film is very nice to look at. Some people didn't like the ending, but I had no real problem with it personally. My only complaints are that the film is a little too long and Sally Field overdoes the exasperation slightly as the mother, but overall this is a delightful film, no matter how many times you see it, you are likely to love it every time, whether it is Williams, the gags or Wilson. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Mrs. Doubtfire
2,bkoganbing,Robin Drags Us Through,8,12 September 2016,"There are some who have commented to me that Mrs. Doubtfire was definitely Robin Williams's greatest role. He certainly is really at the top of his game in this film. A lot of credit has to go to the makeup department as Williams was so convincing as an elderly matron widow who fools his divorced wife into hiring him as a housekeeper, the better to be near his kids as the custody agreement is certainly not in his favor.Sally Field as the wife even says that marriage to Williams was at first a lot of laughs, that is until the kids came along. His inability to hold a steady job in show business and him always being ""on"" for the kids left her in the position of being a villainous disciplinarian.Anyway Robin's gay brother Harvey Feirstein whose partner is a drag entertainer. He fixes up Williams.The makeup that Williams uses is impeccable and flawless. But Robin really creates a separate character with Mrs. Doubtfire. You forget that this is an act and want to believe somehow he's changed into this dowdy housekeeper.I should also mention Pierce Brosnan as a forty something swinger who thinks the divorced Field and her kids are built in family. Stiff competition for Robin. Also TV executive Robert Prosky who Williams is trying to sell an idea for a kid's show.Mrs. Doubtfire definitely one of the top three of Robin Williams's films. What a great an original talent he was.",Mrs. Doubtfire
3,Leofwine_draca,Grating,3,19 September 2021,Wasn't a fan of this one. Turned out to be a cheesy romantic comedy with a tacked-on Robin Williams in drag. His Scots accent really grated on me and I longed for the days of MORK & MINDY as this wasn't it.,Mrs. Doubtfire
4,SnoopyStyle,Not as funny as I thought,7,12 October 2013,"Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is an immature voice actor. He throws a wild party for his kids Lydia (Lisa Jakub), Chris (Matthew Lawrence), and Natalie (Mara Wilson). It's the last straw, and his wife Miranda (Sally Field) files for divorce. Daniel is given only one day a week with the kids, but he can get more time as the new housekeeper Mrs. Doubtfire.Robin Williams is throwing all of his multiple personalities into this performance. Sometimes his manic gyrations actually hit the comedy mark. But it's a tough subject to really laugh at. Director Christopher Columbus injects some heart to compensate for all the divorce talk. As a concept, this is over the top hilarious. But the comedy isn't all there. It is much more compelling as a heart warming divorced family drama than I expected.",Mrs. Doubtfire
5,Hitchcoc,What We Lost,9,31 December 2016,"When Robin Williams died, we lost one of the most creative forces in the history of the entertainment world. He seemed able to latch on to any sort of role and make it his, with that nonstop mind of his. This, of course, has him impersonating a 60 something British nanny who moves in with his own kids in order to be near them. His ex- is Sally Field. Of course, it seems unlikely he would be able to get away with this, but in the context of the movie, he does. What we have from there on are sight gags, close calls, and marvelous improvisation from the master. He also creates an endearing figure that would still pass as a wonderful grandma type in any case. There were times when I forgot Williams was in that costume. There is a delicate touch here that really works. One of the best movies of the year.",Mrs. Doubtfire
6,mark.waltz,She out toots Tootsie.,8,28 November 2019,"Debates about whether or not ""Tootsie"" has stood the test of time were indeed tested with a recent short-lived Broadway musical. That is about to be challenged again with the musical version of this Robin Williams smash hit which gives him different motivations for dressing up as an older woman other than continuing an acting career. Williams is indeed an actor here, an expert in voice-overs, and Williams uses his own plethora of voices to make the character talented and believable but like Dustin Hoffman, a bit difficult. his estranged wife Sally Field announces that she's divorcing him and because of his lack of a working situation, wins custody of their three children with him only getting Saturday visitation. when he discovers that she wants to hire a housekeeper and Nanny, he decides to apply for the position by disguising himself as a 60 year old European Widow, and he gets into every aspect of this character, making the performance absolute perfection.Standing in the way of him winning Field back is the uppity Pierce Brosnan who may have the sophistication but lacks in fatherly scales. There's also the prickly Anne Haney, a social services worker assigned to follow Williams' progression in obtaining and maintaining a job, catching Williams off guard and causing him stress as he has to switch back and forth between both personas. Harvey Fierstein adds more humor as Williams' gay brother who aids in the creation of the mrs. Doubtfire persona.It's easy to see why this was one of the most popular comedies of the 1990s and remains a favorite today. Fields is authoritive and a bit uptight, but as a result of Mrs doubtfire's presents and the change she begins to see in Williams does allow her to turn around a bit. For the changes in Williams, you have to guess that he learns how to be more of a disciplinarian by watching his estranged wife and also realizing that his undisciplined lifestyle is what has gotten him into trouble. I didn't quite believe all of the aspects of how he disciplines the children and their automatic (if reluctant) acceptance of it, but this is such a fun and fast-moving comedy that the little wawas are easy to overlook. Perhaps it comes from a feeling inside Fields and the kids that is an instant connection between them and this remarkable ""woman"".One of the funniest sequences is Fierstein and his lover working on Williams' look, going from hot tamale Hispanic to various Jewish looks, one which results in a historical moment from ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and another from ""Funny Girl"". There's also a lovely flirtation between Mrs. Doubtfire and the attentive bus driver. Plenty of visual slapstick and plenty of heart makes this grade A. If any variation of Mrs. Doubtfire did exist, the world would be a better place.",Mrs. Doubtfire
7,lee_eisenberg,James Brown-tosaurus!,7,17 October 2005,"Just imagine ""Good Morning Vietnam"" transposed to San Francisco and you've basically got ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". Out of work and now divorced, Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) comes up with the most whacked-out plan: he dresses up as the elderly British nanny Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire. From there, he's basically free to be as crazy as possible.Obviously, this movie may be overall about the importance of family, but it is a great excuse for Robin Williams to have a series of great lines (I really liked the scene where he was playing with the dinosaurs). With great support from Sally Field as ex-wife Miranda, Pierce Brosnan as her new hubby Stuart Dunmeyer, and Harvey Fierstein as Daniel's hairdresser brother Frank (I'm assuming that his character was gay), this is one movie that you can't afford to miss.",Mrs. Doubtfire
8,jboothmillard,Mrs. Doubtfire,9,16 March 2005,"A very funny and sometimes emotional comedy drama starring the very talented Robin Williams. He plays an once-impressionist Daniel Hillard who has had to divorce his wife Miranda (Sally Field). He cannot see his kids, Lydia 'Lydie' Hillard (Lisa Jakub), Christopher 'Chris' Hillard (Matthew Lawrence) and Natalie 'Nattie' Hillard (Matilda's Mara Wilson), that often which is breaking his heart. When he hears that Miranda is placing an advert for a house-keeper, he thinks this is a way of secretly seeing his kids. With the help of the same makeup used for Jack Nicholson in Batman, Williams plays a very convincing woman in front of his ex-wife and children called Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire. Unfortunately a friend of Miranda's ""Stu"" (Pierce Brosnan) is inter-fearing with the time he has (secretly) with his kids. Also starring Harvey Fierstein as Uncle Frank Hillard, Robert Prosky as Jonathan Lundy, Liar Liar's Anne Haney as Mrs. Sellner, The Social Worker and Scott Capurro as Aunt Jack Hillard. It won the deserved Oscar for Best Makeup. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 67 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!",Mrs. Doubtfire
9,ccthemovieman-1,"Sorry, But I Wasn't A Fan Of 'Mrs. Doubtfire'",4,1 November 2006,"There are some very funny moments in here, but some very uncomfortable ones, too. I did not enjoy this movie as much as most people. I know we live in a negative age where the put-down is king but when it crosses into mean- spiritedness, as Robin Williams does in here, sorry but I don't think it's funny. I don't think all the language in a comedy is necessary, either. Crime film: okay, but a comedy that features a little kid? No, especially when the kid mimicking her dad uses the Lord's name in vain. That's disgusting.The only worthwhile aspect of this film - outside of Williams' slapstick antics dressed as a woman - was his touching speech at the end of the movie where he's pleading his case for seeing his kids. That's a wonderful speech.",Mrs. Doubtfire
10,moonspinner55,Syrup and cynicism...,6,7 December 2005,"Bright, if derivative, farce with Something to Say. What might have been a robust, old-fashioned, star-driven slapstick comedy quickly becomes a picture filtered through the newfound Hollywood sensibilities--meaning it attempts to mix pathos with the laughs. ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is swathed in feel-goodness. It has a message deep down, and that's a disappointment. Robin Williams plays a divorced dad trying to earn a living as a voice-over actor but finding his ex-wife (Sally Field) pushing him away. Williams' solution in the 1990s seems to be the same as Dustin Hoffman's in the 1980s: win everyone back while disguised as a woman, a big whirligig of sass and smarts to put everything back on track. As amusing as this is, the plot doesn't have any place to go in the second-half; Mom is dating again, and Dad, incognito as the family's housekeeper, attempts to thwart the romance. It's never made clear if the ex-couple still have feelings for one another. Williams argues with Field with wet eyes and a simpering tone (to tell us he's serious), but she is unmovable with him. It's an automatic downer to see a friendly, appealing actress like Sally Field turned into such a harpy--and not even to advance the plot, she just seems in a perpetual bad mood. The kids aren't annoying, and there are some sweet moments and laughs, but much of ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is a combination of syrup and cynicism--not a good match. **1/2 from ****",Mrs. Doubtfire
11,blanche-2,Brilliant performance by Williams makes this a must,9,7 February 2007,"Robin Williams is ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" a father and voice-over specialist who, in drag, becomes a nanny to his own children because he's so desperate to be with them after he and his wife divorce.The premise is very funny - we saw it before 11 years earlier in ""Tootsie,"" and we saw it 20+ years before that in ""Some Like It Hot."" There's something hilarious about seeing men in drag, and Hollywood certainly has had some gifted men in a dress and heels. This time it's Robin Williams' turn, and he's fantastic. Sporting a high-pitched British-Irish accent, a wig, body suit, and a latex face made for him by his gay brother (Harvey Fierstein), Danny, as Mrs. Doubtfire, applies for a job as his kids' nanny. As the treasure Mrs. Doubtfire, Danny accomplishes the one thing he couldn't while he was married - his wife's friendship. He becomes so much more than a nanny. He's a confidant to his wife Miranda (Sally Field) and when she starts dating an old beau (Pierce Brosnan), Mrs. D tries to thwart the relationship. When Miranda holds up two cocktail dresses and asks Mrs. D's advice about which dress to wear on her date, Mrs. Doubtfire replies, straight-faced: ""Neither. Both of them scream harlot."" As usual with Williams, the one-liners come fast and his delivery is perfect.Sally Field is always excellent, as is the rest of the cast, but it's Williams' show. He's so much more than funny - he's warm, he's sad, he gives a perfect picture of an at-loose-ends divorced man who suddenly has no house, no wife, and children he sees once a week. The script gives him ample opportunities to do quick gender changes, and there are some real laugh out loud moments, particularly the scene in the restaurant toward the end.This is a wonderful and touching movie. If you try to ground it in reality, you'll be disappointed not only in this, but in many comedies. To me, Mrs. Doubtfire looked like a fat, bewigged Robin Williams. In real life, Miranda would have been suspicious that it was Danny making all those ridiculous phone calls to apply for the job of nanny - she knows he's a voice specialist. Let this film be what it is and love it. You won't be sorry.",Mrs. Doubtfire
12,Quinoa1984,Not overdone at all,8,28 September 2000,"Some might think that this film isn't funny. But I dare you to watch it (even though it isn't dangerous). This is one of Robin Williams's best acted films to date and he will probably never be any funnier than here (except in a couple of other films and his stand-up). He plays a free-spirited man who's wife is divorcing him. Since he can't stand being apart from his kids, he devises a plan to become a housekeeper in the house, at any cost (even at Oscar winning makeup to turn him into a English maid with wicked humor). Funny in parts, and those parts are the best. but also with a very deep yet almost hidden message about families. Possibly the funniest film by WIlliams and of 1993.",Mrs. Doubtfire
13,sunwarrior13,Robin Williams Makes Mrs.Doubtfire A Great Movie,10,24 August 2014,"Mrs. Doubtfire is a comedy film that features the late Robin Williams and Sally Field.It was based on ""Alias Madame Doubtfire"",a novel written by Anne Fine.In it,we get to see a father who learns to keep in touch with his children in disguise of a sixty-year-old woman.Daniel Hillard is a voice actor Daniel and a loving father.Unfortunately,he isn't a great disciplinarian and somewhat a polarizing role model for his children.This leads to her wife,Miranda to divorce her after losing her patience with him when he threw an elaborate birthday party that created a lot of mess.The courts provided Miranda sole custody of the children and Daniel is allowed to only visit them once a week.Upon learning that her ex-wife is looking for a housekeeper,Daniel uses his gift as an actor and disguised himself as Mrs.Doubtfire,an old English woman.The fun begins when Miranda hired her to take care of the children.As a film,the Mrs.Doubtfire is definitely fun and entertaining.The late Robin Williams was definitely able to elicit a lot laughter for most part as Daniel and when disguised Mrs.Doubtfire.Give credit to his comedic abilities whether physically and his delivery of funny lines.Added to that,it was genuinely humorous as well as it happens to be a family-oriented film as the viewer also gets to deeply care for the situations that Daniel,Miranda and the children are into.The screenplay was definitely realistic as far as a divorcing couple is concerned and the emotions that the children who loves their father deeply are into except of course when Robin Williams moves in and out of drag and his ability to fool the people around him as a sixty-year old nanny.But still,one will surely appreciate the story and the movie as a whole as Mr.Williams was able to elevate the movie at a higher level.Credit should also be given to Sally Field for being a great complement to him as the wife who is fed up with her husband's immaturity.Overall,it was a great movie!!!",Mrs. Doubtfire
14,studioAT,Robin Williams finest hour,8,26 June 2011,"There is something about Mrs Doubtfire that makes me smile every time I see it. There is so much to enjoy about it. It's a family movie thats full of physical comedy, verbal gags and also the odd reference that adults will love that will go right over kids heads and much of this is down to the sheer strength of the performance of Robin Williams.He is totally convincing as both Daniel and Doubtfire and truly captures all the heart of this story effortlessly. The performances of the children are also compelling while Pierce Brosnan is also good in his small role. Everybody loves this film so much and it will live on forever. Why they would want to make a sequel I don't know because this film is truly a one off and concludes so beautifully with the closing lines from Mrs Doubtfire. Just watch this film - you won't regret it.",Mrs. Doubtfire
15,bevo-13678,San Francisco,10,12 June 2020,I like the bit where the bird smokes a cigarette in the cartoon,Mrs. Doubtfire
16,hitchcockthelegend,"Ooooh you wicked, wicked monkey!",8,22 March 2013,"Mrs. Doubtfire is directed by Chris Columbus and adapted to screenplay by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon from the novel Alias Madame Doubtfire written by Anne Fine. It stars Robin Williams, Sally Field, Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence, Mara Wilson, Pierce Brosnan and Harvey Fierstein. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Donald McAlpine.Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard, a struggling out of work actor who when faced with divorce from Miranda (Field) and separation from his three children, disguises himself as an old female housekeeper in order to see them daily.Centrally as a film it is what it is, a chance for Williams (excellent) to dress up in drag and act the goof, but boy does he do it well. In the mix is the serious aspects involving the pain of imminent divorce and separation from one's children. The script is sharp and ready made for Williams' brand of cynical witticisms, while not painting Brosnan's Stuart Dunmire (the new man in Miranda's life) as an oily snake shows good sense in the writing. The child actors are engaging and never sickly, while Fierstein as Daniel's artistic eccentric brother is gloriously colourful.A real family crowd pleaser that turned a profit of over $400 million at the worldwide box office, it's not a film that pushes boundaries of ""drag"" comedy, and you don't have to dig too far for flaws. But this is often very funny and it hits the right emotional beats for the topic at hand. 8/10",Mrs. Doubtfire
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Columbus hits it but good,7,3 May 2008,"I had heard from several people that this was worth watching, so when it aired on television, I did that very thing. Williams is marvelous, the references, the voices, the whole thing, and he delivers on the pathos, as well. The plot is great, and develops nicely. There are pretty predictable parts, but this did surprise me at times. The humor is very good, some childish material, and a part or two are gross-out comedy, but the majority is hilarious, especially if you're into Robin(the actor, not the bird nor the mercilessly slain, if he was hardly the only thing, character of the two Schumacher Batman movies). There are several jokes that are sexual(one certain part seems to have about every alluding phrase that they could get away with in a family film in it), and not all kids should watch it. The drama of this is well-done as well, and the ending was a heckuva lot better than it could have been(in particular with Chris in the director's chair). The music is magnificent. The acting varies, the young 'uns aren't all credible, but that only serves a minor distraction. I recommend this to any fan of the Robin Williams and/or Chris Columbus. 7/10",Mrs. Doubtfire
18,view_and_review,Better Man as a Woman,6,27 June 2020,"In some ways you can say that ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is a feminist's dream. A man becomes a better father once he dresses and behaves like a woman. Is that the sum of the whole movie? Kinda.I know ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is supposed to be a classic and all that, but it was just alright to me. It had its moments, then it would have moments of unbearable sappiness or absurdity.",Mrs. Doubtfire
19,AlsExGal,Mrs. Doubtfire hits the spot,9,14 August 2020,"This massive hit gave Robin Williams a very good opportunity to show both his comic and dramatic abilities. He had done both in previous movies, but this was the first one when he did both at the same time.Williams plays Daniel Hillard, a man who loves his children but is not very good at adulting. Sally Field plays his wife, Miranda, who is an interior designer, and who comes home to a wild birthday party that Daniel is throwing for their son, ironically after being fired from yet another job because he is difficult.This causes a blow up argument between Daniel and Miranda, and Miranda asks for a divorce. Daniel only gets Saturday visitation with his kids, and since he has been with his kids every day of their lives, he is dissatisfied. So when Miranda advertises for a housekeeper, Daniel applies dressed as Mrs. Doubtfire , a personable 50 something British matron, and gets the job. The reason he has such a professional costume and makeup job that his own wife and kids don't recognize him? His brother, played by Harvey Fierstein in a brilliant cameo, is a makeup artist for the film industry. How does this all work out? Let's just say that complications ensue.I'm just going to take a tack on this I haven't heard very many people take. Robin Williams is brilliant in this and his character has my complete sympathy except for the fact that he apparently had a habit of quitting jobs over artistic license in an expensive town like San Francisco with three kids to support. Yet I found Field's character of Miranda completely unlikable. Daniel has been what he has been for years, but she waits until her profession puts her side by side with a wealthy handsome ex-flame (Pierce Brosnan) to ask for that seemingly out-of-the-blue divorce, seems thrilled when she gets sole custody in the initial hearing even though she knows what Daniel's kids mean to him, and stays mum when the second hearing goes badly for Daniel although she certainly knew why Daniel did what he did. In other words, like so many women who file for divorce, she just wishes the father would magically disintegrate as long as his child support checks keep coming. Because in Pierce Brosnan's character she has found a bigger better deal.The message today seems pretty obvious - ""there are all kinds of families"". But believe it or not, while this movie was being filmed, the 1992 presidential campaign was being fought, in part, on the ground of what a real family actually looks like. That and the spelling of the word potato. But I digress.My favorite scene - Daniel is getting ready to leave the house, he and Miranda have separated, and he is saying goodbye to his children. The son blames himself for the separation saying it happened because of his birthday party. Daniel reassures him ""you did nothing wrong. This would have happened regardless."" Children often blame themselves for their parents' divorce and it is important to reassure them that this is not the case.This is a very good drama and comedy. If you want something the whole family can watch, this still fits the bill 27 years later. It skillfully handles the topic of divorce and its impact on children and parents without getting into ""Squid and the Whale"" territory. But you may find yourself asking unanswered questions such as, how do Daniel and Miranda afford what is today a five million dollar house in an expensive city like San Francisco AND three kids? Also, why is Daniel's brother working in San Francisco instead of Hollywood?HIghly recommended.",Mrs. Doubtfire
20,Sylviastel,Robin Williams deserved an Oscar nomination at least for this one!,10,27 August 2002,"Robin Williams is a comedic genius. While I am not entertained by most family comedies, Mrs. Doubtfire is a winner. It can make you laugh easily. Robin's role as a divorced father who wants to spend more time with his children is actually truly believable. Even his role as Mrs. Doubtfire is performed superbly. Too bad, there is no sequel to this film. And the fact that San Francisco plays a big role in the movie is another reason to see it. Like New York City, San Francisco plays a character in this film. It is America's most beautiful city to be compared with the likes of Paris and London. Don't miss this movie! It really is a family oriented film. There are great performances by a superb cast including Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan, Harvey Fierstein, and Anne Haney. Robin was sure robbed of an Academy Award nomination. It could not have been easy to put on so much makeup and transform himself into Mrs. Doubtfire. My favorite scene is the transformation with Harvey Fierstein where Robin uses his great voice to experiment with a Cuban Doubtfire, a Yiddish Doubtfire, and singing Matchmaker with Fierstein is the best part of the film.",Mrs. Doubtfire
21,Mr-Fusion,A shocking misfire,4,6 November 2021,"Thanksgiving, 1993; I can tell you the hype for this movie was no joke. But, I didn't get it then, and I still don't.As a kid, Sally Field was the villain, an unfeeling spouse out to rob her husband of his children and his living space. Looking at it now, she had a point. Robin Williams played a child; he was reckless, unsupportive, he wasn't gonna change. This doesn't really matter because nearly every character is awful, which knee-caps the film's emotional moments and surprisingly (this is an early '90s Robin WIlliams movie for Pete's sake), the humor was just cringe. It is *bad*.This is a poorly written film that telegraphs its story beats, offers little for its stars to work with and I'm eager to move on.Nothing here worked for me.",Mrs. Doubtfire
22,namashi_1,A Classic....,8,6 December 2009,"Chris Columbus adapted the popular Novel 'Madame Doubtfire' into a film called 'Mrs.Doubtfire, which has become a Cult film right from it's release way back in 1993.'Mrs.Doubtfire' is funny, emotional, inspiring, a film that even leaves a great moral. I've seen this film 1,000 times & I never get bored of it. In my opinion, 'Mrs.Doubtfire' will always remain a cult/classic. Robin Williams delivers an Incredible performance. He's fantastic as Doubtfire, and fabulous as himself. Sally Field is excellent, while Pierce Borsman is bland. The kids are delightful. Late Actor Robert Prosky is memorable, as always.What else do I need to say.... watch this film right now!",Mrs. Doubtfire
23,JamesHitchcock,"An analysis of gender roles in late twentieth-century society, But first and foremost a comedy.",9,31 December 2010,"""Mrs. Doubtfire"" has a lot in common with ""Tootsie"", another cross-dressing comedy from around a decade earlier. Like Michael Dorsey, the character played by Dustin Hoffman in that film, the hero Daniel Hillard is an out-of-work actor who spends much of the movie pretending to be a woman. Their motives for female impersonation, however, are different. Michael, unable to find work as an actor, thinks that he will have more success if he becomes an actress. Daniel has recently been though a harrowing divorce from his wife Miranda, who has been awarded custody of their three children. Although Daniel loves his children deeply, he only has limited visitation rights, so in order to spend more time with them he uses his acting skills to disguise himself as a 60-year-old British nanny, whom he names Euphegenia Doubtfire. In his new persona he applies for, and obtains, a job as Miranda's housekeeper.(Mrs Doubtfire is referred to in the script as ""English"", but her accent is definitely Scottish. Her surname, in the context of the film, was taken from a newspaper headline reading ""Police doubt fire was accidental"", but it does appear to be a genuine one. The name ""Euphegenia"", probably a portmanteau of ""Euphemia"" and ""Iphigenia"", seems to be Daniel's own invention).""Tootsie"" was (among other things) a satire on sexist attitudes in the workplace. ""Mrs Doubtfire"" is (among other things) an analysis of gender roles in late twentieth-century society and a critique of American divorce law. Most contested child-custody cases end with custody being given to the mother, largely because of the assumption that women are the caring, nurturing sex and that the father's role is to act as the family breadwinner, a role which, it is assumed, can be performed just as well by an absent father as by a present one. Feminists have been strangely reluctant to criticise this assumption, even though it rests upon ""woman's place is in the home"" stereotypes which, in other contexts, they would be the first to denounce as outdated.There is a good deal of satire in the film at the expense of the American court system and the way in which it handles matrimonial cases. The social worker appointed by the Court to report on the child custody issue is a particular figure of fun. In Britain, social workers are often caricatured as right-on politically correct liberals. In America, to judge from the film, it would seem that they are ultra-conservative old ladies who still think that they are living in the 1950s.""Mrs Doubtfire"" also questions some of our basic assumptions about the sexes. Daniel is not very successful in his career, although he clearly has talent as an actor. It is Miranda, a successful businesswoman, who is the family's main breadwinner. Yet it is Daniel who comes across as the more caring and empathetic in his relationship with the children. Although Miranda means well she is too distant and preoccupied with her business to have much time for them. After her divorce much she is forced to delegate much of their care to the supposed ""Mrs Doubtfire""- care which before the divorce would have been undertaken by their father. Daniel's main fault as a father was that he has been too indulgent with his children and has failed to discipline them. Paradoxically, it is only when he adopts a feminine personality that he is able to become a firm father-figure.The obvious temptation would have been to have turned the film into a sentimental comedy of remarriage by making Miranda's new boyfriend Stuart (played by a pre-Bond Pierce Brosnan) an obvious villain and by having Daniel and Miranda living together again by the end of the film, much to the delight of their children. This temptation was, however, resisted, and I think that was the right decision. The film bravely acknowledges that love does not always conquer all and that not all marriages are made in heaven; it ends, however, with a plea to parents to put the interests of their children first, even when their won relationship is breaking down.It would, however, be wrong to analyse this film solely in terms of social issues. It is, first and foremost, a comedy, and a very successful one. Daniel and his alter ego Mrs Doubtfire are both played by Robin Williams, probably the ideal actor for the role because of his talent as a mimic and his ability to do all sorts of comic voices. Largely because of Williams's talents, the film is one of the funniest American movies of the nineties, with some brilliantly conceived and acted scenes, including his voice-overs for the ""Pudgy the Parrot"" cartoons, the anarchic birthday party he throws for his son and just about everything he does in his ""Doubtfire"" persona. Along with ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""One Hour Photo"" this is one of Williams's greatest films. It is certainly his funniest performance. 9/10",Mrs. Doubtfire
24,StevePulaski,The most meaningful story in the most unlikely screenplay,9,26 August 2014,"I wouldn't have wanted to be the executive or the ambitious screenwriter to stand before a table of men, whose combined salary probably totals more than I'd make in my life times five, to pitch the idea for Mrs. Doubtfire, illustrating its thematic significance and the wonderful opportunities that could flourish inside such a preposterous screenplay. Just describing the film in a coherent sense is difficult, but imagine convincing the ignorant that this film winds up being incredibly moving, even tearjerking, as it persists on, dealing with real characters in a realistic situation in a totally unrealistic way.To put it simply, this is the best film I have seen about a serious topic like divorce taken in a family-friendly manner that is great for all ages, but doesn't compromise its ideas or themes in order to be safe and digestible for the youngest viewer. The youngest viewer, think four, who belongs to two parents, or one at a time, with visitations from the other on the weekends, would likely have no trouble connecting to this film and its concept. Not to mention, the film is actually hilarious in addition to being contemplative, heartbreaking, and genuinely moving. This balancing act screenwriters Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon pull off is nothing shy of extraordinary and, dare I say, should've come in serious consideration for a nomination during Oscar season in 1993.The film concerns Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams), a man of high-energy and great charm, who works as a voice actor in San Francisco, however, recently unemployed. He is married to the lovely, but short-fused Miranda (Sally Field), and lives with their three children, two girls and a boy, and his marriage is already on rocky waters without the threat of job loss coming into play. The back-breaking straw comes when Daniel throws his son a birthday party, complete with a petting zoo and camaraderie from neighborhood kids, after Miranda prevented their son from throwing a party after getting in trouble. Miranda wants a divorce, but Daniel is far too attached to his children, and his children far too attached to him.Daniel is now living with his brother, a professional makeup artist, prohibited from seeing his children unless on a Saturday for a three-month period where employment and domestic stability must be reached in order for a custody extension. Upon finding out his wife is searching for a babysitter for the kids, with numerous applications already filled out, Daniel tampers with the applications so he can phone-in for the ambitious clients and ruin their chances at an interview. He, himself, makes a call to his wife, posing as ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" a loving English nanny, who has ample amount of experience working with the youngest kids and wants to provide fun but discipline for the Hillard kids. Daniel gets into costume, thanks to his brother, which involves a full-body suit, a massive brazier, and loads of makeup, and becomes the nanny he profiled over the phone, much to the delight of Miranda. With his newfound disguise, he manages to still see his children on a daily basis - obviously, though, in a different form - and still tries to be a part of their life.However, the film isn't solely about a man's desperation to see his kids and the fact that he loves them dearly and they love him. While that's certainly a part of this film, the film's about a man's transformation into adulthood in a childish and hugely questionable way. That's the irony of the story; a man is growing up by doing the most immature thing imaginable. Yet, while Daniel is draped in loads of makeup and elderly woman garb, he becomes more of a disciplinary figure, a more organized and grounded man of his word, changing his philosophy and tightening his own leash, while still remaining fun-loving and shapeless to some degree.On top of that, Singer and Dixon wisely make all the kids generally happy characters, never attaching pessimistic or needlessly dramatic stigma to one, ruining the father-children relationship or corrupting the idea that this is a wholesome family burdened by a sad state of affairs. With this, there is infinitely more relatability for audiences, seeing that it's not the fact that the father isn't involved, or the mother isn't capable, or the kids are too much to handle, but the circumstances bestowed upon the family are just a tough slice of life, where the love and romance has soured, and one can't deal with the others traits and vice-versa. With that in mind, there's no wonder why I hear this film being so relatable and helpful for those undergoing divorce or being children of divorce.The idea of a father, devoted and caring, being prevented to see his kids other than one day a week is a tough circumstance and this film doesn't sugarcoat it in the slightest. It shows one man's commitment to raising healthy kids in the most unlikely way ever. As sad as this film can be, however, make no mistake, for it is hilarious all the more. Williams' quick-witted brand of comedy delivers in every possible way, and just when you think Williams' manic energy is going to prevent for deeper emotions to come through, he blindsides by delivering a powerful monologue or showcasing complex emotions in a way that is crowdpleasing and simply wonderful in every sense.Mrs. Doubtfire is a wonderful family film, uproariously funny, heartbreaking, but honesty and consistently wholesome even in its most manic or mildly crude state. It'd be blatantly wrong to say the film isn't a tad messy or all-over-the place, but such is life, and with this great of a screenplay and such strong performances from everyone involved, I hardly minded. The film is a glorious gem that touches the spirit of what it means to be human, imperfectly so.",Mrs. Doubtfire

26,MovieAddict2016,Very funny at times,7,26 September 2005,"IMDb user Blake French writes, in regards to ""Mrs. Doubtfire"": ""'Mrs. Doubtfire' is one of the most invigorating, vivid character studies to be produced on the big screen this decade. Most of the characters are strongly executed with decisive dialogue. They are also beautifully written with tainted personalities and uncompromising wit. Chris Columbus has assembled a stellar dramatic comedy with excellent screen writing, giving audiences one of the most punctually artful films I have ever witnessed."" I don't really agree with this. I wouldn't quite call it a ""punctually artful"" film. There's nothing artful about a hairy guy stuffing a cake onto his face to make it look like an exfoliating cream. Or running around swapping clothes in a restaurant like a frantic ape.But this movie is funny... and for as slapstick as its humor is, it's also surprisingly human in nature, which is something Blake touched upon in his review.Robin Williams stars as Daniel, a guy whose wife (Sally Field) leaves him with their three kids after he misses his kid's birthday party. (Ooh, talk about grounds for divorce!) Daniel loves his kids, though, so he dresses up as a woman with prosthetic effects and becomes their nanny under the false identity of an Irish (?) housekeeper named Mrs. Doubtfire.Meanwhile Daniel's ex-wife begins dating a rich and suave English businessman (Pierce Brosnan pre-James Bond) and he becomes jealous, trying to ruin their relationship under the guise of Doubtfire.This movies is quite similar to the Dustin Hoff ""classic"" comedy ""Tootsie"" in terms of plotting. They're both quite funny and some of the only guy-in-drag films that are actually good.Williams is funny (one of his last truly humorous performances) and totally steals the spotlight from everyone else - including Brosnan.Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"") has a way of making over-the-top films while managing to restrain them to the elements of humanity, and that's the clearest thing about this film - what makes it funny and, ultimately, so likable, even when it's not cracking us up consistently.",Mrs. Doubtfire
27,OllieSuave-007,Funny family get-together movie.,7,4 March 2014,"This is a comedy drama that is great for the entire family, starring Robin Williams as a divorced husband Daniel Hillard who disguises himself as female housekeeper Mrs. Doubtfire to help tend the household for his ex-wife, who has custody over their children, so he could spend time with this three kids.The pace, acting, and character development fits the movie's script very well, and the movie is as funny as it sounds. Who wouldn't be charmed to see a divorced man dunning a wig, old lady clothes and a semi-high pitched voice to hide from his ex-wife so he could be with the people he loves the most - his children. Though comedy filled with some corny moments and slapstick humor, this film sends an important message of what it means to be a family.My favorites parts are seeing the children's expression when they first meet Mrs. Doubtfire; Daniel playing soccer dressed as as Mrs. Doubtfire; and Daniel pushing away a would-be mugger dressed as Mrs. Doubtfire.Overall, it is a pretty good film for some laughs and family time.Grade B",Mrs. Doubtfire
28,thesar-2,Toot-toot-Fired,8,2 June 2013,"I used to have a huge grudge against Mrs. Doubtfire. Yes. I did. And all because of a Mrs. Tootsie.Granted they're not entirely the same movieOut of work straight actor, dresses as a woman to get a new career and to impress the girl he likes. Both are comedies, have heart, are both hilarious and touching and had to do with the lead actor working on television. Wait Damn. They pretty much are the same movie.The reason I had a thing against Mrs. D is that I was so in love with the movie Tootsie – and still am, and more people forgot all about that movie in lieu of this one.Butafter purchasing this on BluRay and rewatching for the (probably) 13th time, I really, REALLY enjoyed this feature. Perhaps one day we can all live in a world where we can appreciate both? Well, maybe just this one since – ah-HEM – Tootsie is yet to be available on BluRay. Great, now I am back to hating on this movie.Joke. And speaking of which, this movie, though extremely formulaic, is a riot. Thanks to the perfect timing and lines from Robin Williams. When he's wacky he's hilarious. When he had low humor, it's deep and still uproarious. And when he's serious, he shows a ton of heart. Secondary characters, Sally Fields, Pierce Brosnan, Polly Holliday and Harvey Fierstein also played their roles great and often funny. Even they kids played their roles fairly well.Man both loses his job and wife fairly quickly and must learn to deal with the time away from his kids, a new life including rent and job and the fact that the only way to see his kids is to dress as an English maid, a la the title character.Really, overall, the movie's extremely harmless and an enormous amount of fun and heart, but there was that nagging feeling I got about how, even in 1993, un-accepting everyone was, including the children, of a man dressing up as a woman in..SAN FRANCISCO?If you can suspend your disbelief for that, you'll have a great time. Well, at least, until Tootsie is finally available on BluRay. Tick-tock, tick-tock",Mrs. Doubtfire
29,ElMaruecan82,"The fun of ""Tootsie"" with the poignancy of ""Kramer vs. Kramer""... and Robin Williams in his most defining role, laughs-wise and tears-wise...",8,15 January 2016,"Looking at the American Film Institute's list of Top 100 funniest movies, you'll notice that the first one is ""Some Like it Hot"" and the second is ""Tootsie"". No need to be a movie expert to know what the two classics have in common. Men dressed as women is probably one of the oldest, and curiously underused, comedic gimmicks, it's an awkward intrusion into the forbidden world, carrying a strange mixture of voyeurism and self-questioning, something capturing both the privilege and the curse of being a woman, which also teaches one lesson or two about being a man. You can make it with laughs, with tenderness, and sometimes with poignant drama.Chris Columbus' 1993 comedy hit, ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" belongs to this cross- gender movie traditions, and is rightfully listed at the 67th position in AFI's list. And while it didn't reinvent the wheel on the comedic field, the film bears a strong resemblance with dramas such as ""Kramer vs. Kramer"". It seems obvious since it deals with divorce, but there's more into it: Roger Ebert criticized the film for being another showcase of Williams' imitation talent, and while it worked for ""Aladdin"", it failed flat in this film. His mistake, in my opinion, was to misjudge the audience's expectations, it wasn't to see a man dressed in drag, but to see Robin Williams be that man, not because Williams would give another dimension to the film (kids and their parents didn't know he went through divorce) but because Williams was a popular family-appealing actor and his role as Daniel Hillard embodied his personality: a man raunchy enough to appeal to dads, tender enough to have this awe-factor with mothers, and any mimics, or voice bits would appeal to the kids. Hillard is probably the closest character to Williams.Indeed, Williams can overplay his eccentric facets like Lemmon in 1959 but he can also break your heart when he mentions his kids, or when he whispers something to his youngest daughter. And as ""Tootsie"" dealt with unemployment and gender battle, ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is a movie about divorce that shows to which desperate extremes a father can be pushed to, in order to keep seeing his kids. I don't understand how Ebert could overlook this aspect. That's to say, the film has both the laughs and the heart, and while it would be a stretch to say that all the gags work (on that level, some bits are more predictable than others), ""Doubtfire"" is something more than a movie about a disguised Williams. And it's a good reminder of a time where a good old- fashioned comedy could win at the box-office.So, the story is about a family that goes through the harsh experience of divorce, a time where enough is enough and a husband a wife realize they're going through different directions. The set-up is a bit awkward as it leaves us wondering why this successful businesswoman, Miranda, played by Sally Field married this goof-ball voice-actor with the energy and the temper of a teen. When a man celebrates his son's thirteenth birthday by organizing a whole zoo party and dance on a table, you gotta wonder why he didn't expect it would upset his wife, they were really totally different. What follows is a poignant argument where Miranda finally asks for divorce and it doesn't come as a surprise that she gets the custody. I don't even think the kids were surprised. Hillard can only see his children on weekends, which is not enough obviously, he's got three months to prove the judge he's capable to take care of himself, hence the kids, and one way leading to another, he works in a TV station, as a janitor (it seems a bit contrived that all of a sudden, he couldn't find something on the entertainment field) and when he learns that the mother is about to hire a nurse, well, he goes to his makeup expert brother (Harvey Fiernstein) and asks if he can turn him into a woman. I guess the next scene probably upset Ebert as it was another montage of Williams' imitation talent (that and the first interview) but while it was out of place in a movie like ""Dead Poets Society"", it seemed natural that Williams' character would do such things. (If there's one point this review is trying to make by the way is that, once you get that Hillard is Robin Williams' alter-ego, you start watching the movie with different eyes.)So, Hillard becomes Mrs. Doubtfire and if things don't go quite well at start, he quickly impresses Miranda, and he surprisingly turns into a better father model than as he was a man, which echoes the ""Tootsie"" situation: sometimes, it takes to be like the mother to know the father's job. The movie escalates from comedic situations to another, I have a soft spot for the flirtatious bus driver, and the little roasting poor rival Lou (Pierce Brosnan in his dashing pre- Bond years) has to take from a jealous old hag. And the hilarity pinnacles with two simultaneous restaurant dates, including one that has Hillard's professional future at stakes. Well, it's easy to figure where it goes, but we follow Hillard's troubles with excitement and fun.The resolution the film offers is sweet and balanced, like in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", it's something that appease the minds and allows us to understand both parts. The emotional outcome of the film is to remind us that Robin Williams went through divorce and didn't have to act, while it was to do these voices number that irritated Ebert or when he talked about the divorce. And looking at the film after William's untimely passing, makes it impossible to watch, without shedding a nostalgic tear. God I miss the 90's, and I miss Robin Williams",Mrs. Doubtfire
30,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Housekeeping.,6,28 March 2020,"Let's be honest, the concept of 'Mrs. Doubtfire (1993)' is just a little creepy. It's not so much the drag as it is the con; the stalking, the trespassing, the manipulation. It's as unhealthy as it is illegal, the sort of behaviour that signifies anything but a well-adjusted individual. That's not what the movie would have you believe, though. Apparently, Williams' voice-actor protagonist is a golden-hearted, endlessly loving father who'll do just about anything to see his kids - other than what the courts have recommended, that is. The biggest problem most characters seem to have with the scheme is that it involves putting on a pair of breasts. The film, of course, is presented in earnest. It's focused on being as funny and farcical as possible. Thankfully, it is chuckle-worthy and it does feel like a farce. It's characters are well-rounded and its tone is suitably light. It's generally enjoyable. However, some of its jokes haven't aged all that well; the thing often borders on transphobia. Some of it is also a little too mature for its audience. It has a weird pacing and it's over before you know it, lacking a proper sense of escalation. It isn't bad, just flawed. Its attempts at sentimentality often fall short, but its overall message is effective and, even, somewhat nuanced. For the most part, it's an entertaining experience. 6/10",Mrs. Doubtfire

Enough about my personal life, does this movie hold up? Yes, it certainly does. I actually heard Robin Williams was in a lot of bad comedies in his later career. I guess I can't really say his funniest movie was ""Aladdin"". This would be his best pure comedy!We still see a lot of great dramatic moments in it too. The plot features a guy who crossdresses to find more time to spend with his kids after a custody battle. We get a lot of great little jokes sprinkled throughout the whole film. Through all of this, it still manages to be quite realistic. It's not a fairy tale happy ending, but it's at least hopeful. Man, was Marla Wilson prolific. ***1/2",Mrs. Doubtfire

It is a very fun family film that is jam packed with scenes that will have the whole family laughing, mostly because Robin Williams comedic timing is unbelievably brilliant. He gives a charming performance as a loving father who just wants more time with his kids, it is clear that he used his own love for hos children in his performance. I did feel, at times, that the plot was somewhat slow moving. There are not enough fast paced, fun sequences, such as Daniel's meeting with the inspector or the montage of him becoming a successful nanny, we could have done with more of these.There is a lot of heart in this film and it had me shedding tears on several occasions as a result of how real it is. The relationship between Daniel and Miranda is a couple we have all seen before, their struggles are real and the emotions conveyed by the actors are life like. It is a film that leaves me in a good mood after every viewing, it has plenty of laugh out loud moments and ones that will warm your heart, all together making it a very well rounded family film. Very funny and sweet, Mrs. Doubtfire is certainly worth the watch if you are looking for a good film for the whole family to enjoy.

37,sol-,Divorce His,6,20 April 2017,"Granted limited visitation rights, a divorced father disguises himself as a nanny to spend more time with his kids in this iconic Robin Williams comedy. Always a skilled comedian, Williams does some excellent vocal work here, not only nailing a proper English accent, but having lots of fun pretending to be various unsuitable nannies when making crank phone calls to his ex-wife. For all the makeup and hairstyling work though, Williams still looks very similar when in disguise here and the film therefore requires incredible suspension of disbelief to accept that his kids and wife (who have known him for years) do not quickly catch onto the charade. There is also an incredulous restaurant coincidence in the second half that leads to some over-the-top theatrics. The film's less elaborate comedy scenes work quite nicely though. Especially well done is a sequence in which Williams has to pretend to be both himself and his sister to appease a court-appointed social worker. Williams also gets away with saying some incredibly funny things in Mrs. Doubtfire's posh accent, particular regarding Pierce Brosnan as his ex-wife's latest suitor, without ever breaking character. Sally Field is stuck in a rather thankless part, very toned down opposite Williams, but she gets her share of good moments too with some of her reactions to Mrs. Doubtfire's suggestions.",Mrs. Doubtfire

40,filipemanuelneto,One of the best comedies I've ever seen.,10,14 February 2017,"There are some actors who shine with their own light when put into the right environment and Robin Williams was one of those. From his long career (which was interrupted too precociously) we can count on several good films, some more famous or popular than others. However, it was through comedy that he stood out and, here, he had the whole film to show everything he could do. The result is one of the funniest and most addictive comedies I've ever had the pleasure of watching. In fact, Williams performance is the film's nerve core, supporting the action, the cast, the script, everything. The story revolves around a loving father whose professional instability prevented from maintaining partial custody of his children when divorce comes, thereby deciding to disguise himself as a woman to spend more time with his children. So we also have a beautiful and edifying moral background: the importance of family ties and paternal love. We cannot fail to observe the convincing way the makeup artists disguised Williams. The film also has the meritorious participation of Sally Field and Pierce Brosnan, in a more humorous record that is relatively unusual for the actor.",Mrs. Doubtfire

Maybe it's because my genes with tasteful french comedies, maybe it's because American ones are too much about spoofs, wealthy people, too much sophisticated and prude and not enough natural and telling about normal lives! Another explanation is that American movies were much original in the 90s that since the 2K! It has not anymore great talent in that field : So, Robin was an extraordinary one and this « Mrs Doubtfire » puts really the fire ! The idea is simple and appeals to all and the movie really knows how to play with that proximity ! But what i particularly likes here is that for one time, the good guy is mean ! Robin wants to make his rival played by the excellent phlegmatic and cool Brosnan bit the dust and he does what he needs ! His relationships with his kids are moving and it was good to meet back the teen from « matinée » ! It's also a good analysis of what divorce is about and it's played in a way that is OK for kids.

Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard a voice over actor who got fired from his job and is set for a bitter divorce from his wife Miranda played by The Amazing Spiderman star Sally Field who has had it with him and she wants full custody of their children,so Daniel comes up with a great plan to see his kids more often by you guess it disguise himself as an old Scottish woman called Mrs Doubtfire thanks to his best friend who is a Special Effects Make Up Artist. The disguise is so good no one knows that its him behind the prosthetic mask that he wears along with the white wig and the body suit and frock. But problems arise when he finds out that his ex wife has met someone else who goes by the name Stu played by former James Bond star Pierce Brosnan. So what do I like and not like about this movie,well first what I liked about it was the acting and the humor which was brilliant,no matter what film Robin Williams is in he always makes me laugh,another thing I liked was the story because Robin's charcther was desperate to see his kids again and his wife was such a bitch to him he demanded to see them more. Also what I like about this film is the Special Make Up Effects that is done by Greg Gammon who also did the Special Make Up Effects for the 1994 film The Mask,I swear when Robin Williams was dressed up as that Scottish nanny I was shocked at it I was like saying to myself who plays that old lady that looks like Robin William's grandmother or whatever and then when he rips off the mask from his face I was like WHAT that's a dude in drag hilarious.And now to the bad I absolutely hated seeing the part where Robin Williams would switch from Daniel to Mrs Doubtfire every now and again and seeing him rip off the mask off his face,I got kinda disgusted cause that sorta creeps me out as its so real looking and you think he was ripping the skin off his face,but in saying that I really enjoyed this film and if you haven't seen it then check it out.",Mrs. Doubtfire
45,lisafordeay,A hilarious film starring the late Robin Willams,8,2 January 2018,"Mrs Doubtfire is a 1993 comedy drama starring the late Robin Williams and tells the story about a failed voice actor named Daniel Hillard who is on the verge of a divorce with his overbearing wife Miranda(played by Sally Field)who has had it with Daniel as he threw a party for his son Chris(Matthew Lawrence)that went horribly wrong. Of course when Daniel goes to court the judge files an order for Daniel where he can only see his kids on Saturdays for a couple of hours. Heartbroken Daniel ends up changing his ex wife's housekeeping ad so he can use his voice acting skills to the test. Of course he ends up disguising himself as a 60 year old Scottish nanny dubbed Mrs Doubtfire. The disguise is so good his wife has no idea that Mrs Doubtfire is Daniel wearing a mask and a body suit. His disguise allows him to see his kids even more and he later ends up getting jealous as his ex wife is seeing Stu(played by Pierce Brosonan). Although Daniel can see his kids now everyday,how long can he keep up with the fascade.
I took along break from this film till about a few years later as at first I thought it was purely stupid having Robin Williams in drag, But when I seen it again after 10 long years I ended up finding it to be a very endearing hilarious film. Both myself,my mom and my granny all love this film as we were laughing so hard with Williams getting his face covered in cake,him switching places during the climax scene and so much more hilarious moments. I ended up shedding a few tears in the end as I hadn't seen it since Williams death. 
Overall I will forever miss Mr Robin Williams as he was a remarkable man with a heart of gold a childlike persona.
You will forever be missed Mr Williams.Also I have to admit the special make up effects to create Mrs Doubtfire was brilliant you wouldn't think that Williams was Mrs Doubtfire all along.8/10

46,GOWBTW,Tootsie of the 90's!,8,25 May 2007,"Another movie in drag? Only the elderly type. Here we have an actor named Daniel Hillard(Robin Williams) who left a cartoon job when he didn't like the part where his bird character smokes, and he leaves the studio Porky Pig style. So what did he do, throw a party in his house which would lead to his wife's (Sally Field) dismay. When the divorced, the children totally resent the mother. So what does Daniel do? he gets a job as a babysitter to see his kids in secret. Not as Daniel Hillard, but as Mrs. Doubtfire. The disguise is so perfect, not even the ex-wife could tell it was him. I liked the part where they played ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"" when he/she was vacuuming, then did the leap before you sweep. Robin got that scene down hard. It was even better when the character got herself a new show, Mrs. Doubtfire would live on in that show if not in real life. After all the babysitter hirers they were even put on hold, or rejected. Especially that one lazy wannabe sitter. It was very funny, and very heart-warming, it teaches a lesson on how to deal with divorce. 4 out of 5 stars!",Mrs. Doubtfire
47,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Mrs. Doubtfire,10,5 September 2021,10/10 - Robin Williams is at his best in this hysterical and highly memorable comedy that mostly holds up today.,Mrs. Doubtfire
48,Lechuguilla,Funny Stuff,9,8 November 2010,"Funny man Robin Williams morphs into an old nanny with a British accent, named ""Euphegenia Doubtfire"". The film's premise is as clever as it is silly. And only Robin Williams could have made the film work. After an effective opening, the plot zips right along, unfolding a deft story that includes various site gags, en route to an ending that is believable, given the film's genre and character setup. A serious message, pertinent to marriage and children, frames and supports the comedic plot, which gives the film depth and substance.The entire production hangs on the talents of Robin Williams: versatile, energetic, improvisational, and hugely entertaining. It's the kind of talent that seems natural, not studied or forced. The rest of the cast orbits Williams, but does so effectively. There's not a weak casting link in the bunch. And makeup artists must have had a field day with Mrs. Doubtfire, who, though rather imposing for a female, comes across quite believable, again given that the film is a comedy.My only ""serious"" complaint is the cinematography. That widescreen projection is too severe. I would have preferred more of a full screen projection.""Mrs. Doubtfire"" will not be everyone's cup of tea. You have to give the film wide latitude. But I liked it. I laughed, not only at Robin Williams, but also at the dialogue and the plot's improbable situations. A sense of the absurd is what comedy is all about.",Mrs. Doubtfire
49,snoozejonc,Decent comedy with Williams on form,7,28 April 2021,"A father takes some extreme actions to spend time with his children following a separation from their mother.This is a solid comedy with a strong feel of father's rights running through it and a humorous turn from Robin Williams.The plot is fairly weak, but it allows the comedy to flow and sets up some decent emotional scenes. There is some major suspension of disbelief required but this is balanced out by the laughs and heartfelt moments.Daniel and his alter-ego Mrs Doubtfire are good value for their screen time, with strong dialogue and reasonably good sight-gags. The one-liners are constant, but I think my favourite single visual moment is at the birthday party near the beginning when we see Daniel bouncing on top of a dining table to House Of Pain with all the partying children as his estranged wife looks on in horror.Daniel's transformation sequence is for me the strongest overall scene in the movie. Seeing the creation of Mrs Doubtfire along with his brother in action works immensely well and is hilarious.Some scenes are less effective than others. The courtroom scenes are not in the slightest bit plausible. Every argument between the two parents feels forced. The character of Miranda never once feels like she has it in her to deprive the children of their father, yet it continues to happen for the plot to move forward.Performances are mostly strong. Sally Field is likeable but the character feels written as a foil for the madness of Robin Williams, who puts on another awesome show of talent. Harvey Fierstein is excellent in his brief appearance as Frank. Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence and Mara Wilson are good as the children.",Mrs. Doubtfire
50,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,One of Robin Williams' best to date,10,21 November 2005,"This film is one of Robin Williams' best to date. One of the best things about it is when he does impressions of people. It's hard for me to say which one I think is the funniest. After Miranda (Sally Field) told Daniel (Robin Williams) that she wanted a divorce, I wanted to cry. This was because he cried, too. At that moment, when the kids (Matthew Lawrence, Lisa Jakub, Mara Wilson) were seen, I could feel their pain. Still, this is an excellent comedy with a humanistic message for all Robin Williams and Sally Field fans. If you ask me, Stu (Pierce Brosnan) was a really nice guy. Before I wrap this up, I must say that the performances were top grade. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Robin Williams or Sally Field, you're in for a good time and lots of laughs, so see this movie today.",Mrs. Doubtfire
51,davispittman,"Fun, endearing film",8,3 April 2017,"This is an absolute classic! The late Robin Williams (RIP xoxo) plays a husband/father who is going through a divorce with his wife Miranda (the incredible Sally Field). He wants desperately to still be involved daily in the lives of his three children. But after the judge rules that Miranda has full custody and he only gets visitation rights, he sees no other option but to..... become Mrs Doubtfire. Williams goes to his brother and his partner for help to transform him into a woman in order to be able to be his children's nanny. After a hilarious transformation sequence, it's done. Let me just take a moment and say that Robin Williams is great in this role, his portrayal as Mrs Doubtfire is just hilarious. There are scenes where the script just works so well and more than succeeds in making the audience fall over laughing. And Sally field is great as his ex wife Miranda Hillard. She can be funny when the script allows for it, and then she can be very serious and dramatic. And Field succeeds at both. Pierce Brosnan is good too, I enjoyed his performance as Miranda's new love interest. The writing is awesome for this film. Loads of laugh out loud hilarious lines for almost every character. And then the script allows for some very endearing sweet family moments. 8/10 for Mrs. Doubtfire! Very fun time.",Mrs. Doubtfire
52,gcd70,"Great comedy, nothing else",6,9 December 2007,"The comedy in this movie deserves an 8/10 as it is marvelous and often hilarious. Director Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"") once again shows his particular expertise at handling such riotous goings on as he keeps the humour rolling thick and fast while sensibly keeping all other aspects of the film in the background. For sadly the drama in the movie only deserves a 3/10 as it is clumsily handled for the most part, and relatively disappointing. Although the narrative does avoid the painfully obvious, it does become weighed down with unnecessary emotional baggage and is too mushy at the end.Still in all it is a very funny feature, benefiting much from the manic Robin Williams (infinitely better in drag than out of it) who creates a real side splitting character out of ""Mrs. Doubtfire"".One can forgive the obvious connection with ""Tootsie"" (the two movies would make a great double feature by the way - with the superior ""Tootsie"" screening first of course) as even that film was not the first of its kind. Loads of fun if you're willing to sit back, relax and let your sense of humour have a field day.Thursday, December 16, 1993 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne",Mrs. Doubtfire
53,questl-18592,Mr Doubtfire,7,3 February 2021,"RIP Robin, you're so dearly missed.There aren't many who can pull off the things that Robin Williams could. His ability to be so compassionate, brilliant, cutting and hilarious all at the same time are legendary for good reason. Ashamed to say I'd never seen this one before now, I may have caught snippets here and there but never actually watched it. 100% not the movie I thought it was. I was expecting Williams to be doing his best Mary Poppins impression and NOPE! His juggling act with the body suit and the guise of Doubtfire were hilarious through and through. He's absiolutely incredible when he's doing his thing, it's everything else that sort've failed to keep up. The family is kinda blah, the movie is so very much of it's time with some super 90s montage moments. But this was still a great watch.If you, like me, managed to not see this do yourself a favor and correct the error. It's not a perfect film by any means, but it's definitely fun and worth the time. Absolutely recommend it.",Mrs. Doubtfire
54,adamjohns-42575,An older eye sees a different film.,6,5 May 2021,"For my fourteenth birthday I basically demanded that I was given this film on VHS from my Mother. This and 'Jurassic Park'. I seem to recall that I saw them both at the cinema at least twice.My love for Robin Williams was at its peak,
having been won over by him in 'Hook' and seeing him be brilliant as the mad alien in 'Mork and Mindy'. He could do no wrong in my eyes and the humour in this film with those funny little moments all wrapped up in a story of love really spoke to me through Robin's many hilarious voices.However, even back then I found the swapping and changing between characters a bit too much. It still gets on my nerves.All these years later I have watched it again and found that it has not aged very well at all. The love he feels for his children and the important message that it sends still works and resonates with me.The stalking his own family dressed as a British Nanny though has actually become more creepy. I actually felt sorry for him, because he clearly had mental issues, not just because he was being separated from his family. It's quite hard to watch and not find it somewhat unsavoury for him to be spying on his loved ones whilst going to extremes to become this character. He loses sight of why he started in the first place and gets out of his depth. I know how hard it is when there are three great kids that you cannot see for whatever reason, so I can sympathise, but this is another level of nutty even for me. Psychologists must study films like these during training.If you can try not to focus on the unstable behaviour and just watch it for the fun, there is some good interaction between Mrs D and the supporting cast, especially with Pierce Brosnan's character. The hoovering/sweeping scene is always a classic too, but I think that I have seen the dark side now and it's put me off for the time being. Maybe I will return to visit Mrs Doubtfire again in the distant future, but it will only be to reminisce about my old VHS tape from back in the day.P. S. I loved Harvey Fierstein as the brother.",Mrs. Doubtfire
55,triple8,Hardly Tootsie,7,25 August 2003,"Decent enough comedy. Robin Williams is hysterical as always. Howver, this movie can't come close to ""Tootsie"", I think Dustin Hoffman was so unforgettable in his role that he may have spoiled it for others. Although Williams is certainly funny, the ""man as woman"" premise will always be associated with Tootsie. That said, this is certainly a funny movie-I'd give it a 7.",Mrs. Doubtfire
56,Movie-ManDan,Funny and Feel-Good.,9,27 October 2017,"Robin Williams is the best. Here he is in one of his best roles in what became the quintessential gender-bending movie. I want to start out by saying this is not nearly as good as Some Like It Hot or Tootsie. Both those achieve the highest level of excellence, this doesn't. And Some Like It Hot is also the funniest movie ever. Mrs. Doubtfire is the next best thing.Robin Williams plays talented actor Daniel Hillard. He loves his family more than anything and his principles keep him a good man. If you make a list of ""Best Movie Fathers"" Daniel Hillard would be high on it. Following his son's (Matthew Lawrence) 12th birthday, Daniel gets divorced from his wife Miranda. if there is one flaw that costs the movie from achieving a higher status equal to Tootsie or Some Like It Hot, it's Sally Field's character. It's pretty rare for one character to diminish the other all quality of a movie, but it happens here. She claims Daniel is too immature and she doesn't love him. Never do we get the level of bitterness Miranda has towards her husband. There's one scene where she explains that she's better without him, but it seems more like she fell out of love just out of the blue and she loves seeing Daniel suffer. Then there's one scene where she picks up the kids from Daniel's apartment an hour early after dropping them off an hour late. She had to do other stuff, so the kids will be pretty bored in the car while they could be with their dad. I know the scene is meant to sabotage her ad for a housekeeper, but it really annoys me how mean Miranda is.Miranda is a successful architect and Daniel recently lost a voice-over gig so he's unemployed. Thus, Miranda gets full custody of the kids with Daniel getting them one day of the week. Its understandable why the custody was set up this way, but we still feel tremendous remorse for Daniel as we feel how much he loves his kids. He enlists the help of his make-up artist brother to transform him into a an elderly woman to be Miranda's maid so that he can be with his kids. His alias is Mrs. Doubtfire who is too good to be true. Meanwhile, Daniel gets a job as a shipping clerks at a TV station where his boss gets to see some of his talent. Williams as Daniel and Mrs. Doubtfire is done to perfection.The one flaw about the comedy was there wasn't a whole lot of scenes where it seemed that the truth of Mrs. Doubtfire's identity would be revealed. Moments like those cause sheer excitement on top of hilarity. But there is one chunk of the film taking place at a fancy restaurant where he tries to sell himself to be a new host to his boss and must be Mrs. Doubtfire in a different area. Constantly changing outfits, this is the only bit of excitement mixed with the comedy as we don't want the secret to be revealed. It unfortunately does. Here is the next huge flaw of the movie: the judge awards full custody to Miranda and Daniel has supervised visits with his kids one day a week. He says Daniel's behaviour is harmful and recommends mental help. They try to make Daniel out to be a perverted monster. I've always hated this scene. Miranda is in the worst arc and Daniel being branded as evil is the worst scene.So it is evident that there are too many flaws to say this achieves the status of greatness. Yes the good stuff outweighs the bad, but the bad stuff it too strong. The hilarity and its heartfelt view on divorce has made this timeless. There is also views of San Fransisco and the musical score that add to the nice feel. The movie may be about divorce, but it is handled very well--one of the best I've seen in a movie. And there's how the Mrs. Doubtfire alias has changed everyone for the better. That's gender-bender 101 and it is probably my favourite strength here.I love this movie dearly. But I may never give it the highest standard. No big deal, I hold this near and dear to my heart.3.5/4",Mrs. Doubtfire
57,PredragReviews,"""Carpe dentum. Seize the teeth.""",9,8 February 2017,"This film is unforgettable because of Robin Williams. He is a passionate actor and when the role exhibits his comedic talent with no limitation, the character becomes intriguing and genuine. ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is about a man who dresses as a Scottish dowager to invade the household of his estranged wife, who has thrown him out. Here we find Robin Williams lurks behind a latex face mask, ready to scatter wicked jokes and brilliant non sequiturs about whatever crosses his mind. Robin Williams's genius is in these details, and it is given free rein during much of ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" as in the sequence that has him improvising with toy dinosaurs at a television studio and coming up with a Raptor Rap. A lot of the film has gone into giving a sitcom shininess to ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" which was directed by Chris Columbus. Attention has been paid to everything from the sunny, well-heeled look of the family household to the pert costumes on Sally Field, who plays Robin Williams's careerist wife. The story is that the wife's job alone is enough to villainies her: Miranda Hillard (Sally Field) is seen doing something terribly important involving fabric swatches, while her sweet, helpless husband, Daniel (Robin Williams), cannot stay employed dubbing voices onto animated films. When Miranda complains about his childishness, kicks him out of the house and keeps him from seeing enough of their three children.Robin Williams remains the film's main and only real attraction, although Ms. Sally Field tries gamely to generate sitcom-caliber sparks. Robin Williams is definitely well worth seeing whatever he's wearing, but he's most fun in an anarchic mode, threatening to blow the film's illusions wide open. The dress, the mask and Mrs. Doubtfire's gentility are inherently very funny, but nothing holds Robin Williams back when he's on a roll. You may not believe he could pass for a woman, but you'll want to see what he can do with a vacuum cleaner all the same. One thing ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" does well is to avoid the often-used plot device of trying to turn Pierce Brosnan's Stu, who is Miranda's new love interest, trying to turn him into a snake. He never comes across as anything but charming, and Daniel's dislike of him is based on purely selfish reasons. In fact, there really isn't a nasty or mean-spirited character in the film. Imagine that, a film without a villain! This film is a bit over-the-top, but incredibly fun and wonderfully engineered with an obvious chemistry between all the players. I highly recommend it! Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Mrs. Doubtfire
58,philip_vanderveken,A fine feel-good movie,8,11 January 2005,"I can't compare Mrs. Doubtfire to Tootsie, Dustin Hoffman's classic, because I haven't seen that one yet. But what I can say is that overall I liked this one, even though it sometimes had its lesser moments. The story may not be very original, but thanks to Robin Williams it certainly is more than just worth a watch. I love to see him play and certainly in this movie where he has a double role. His facial expressions, his different little voices and his improvising skills, it all adds to the fun.In this movie he is Daniel Hillard an actor who is about to lose everything. He already lost his job and now his wife is going to leave him and take his kids away from him as well. Because he loves his kids so much and because he knows that his wife is looking for a housekeeper, he decides to fill in that vacancy. He disguises himself as Mrs. Doubtfire and is able to be with his kids every day, despite a court order.From time to time the story is a bit too sweet and corny, but overall this movie is very good and very enjoyable. This is really a feel-good movie that can and will be loved by the entire family. I give it a 7.5/10.",Mrs. Doubtfire

Completely unaware, Miranda (Sally Field) renews her zest for life and begins to depend on Mrs. Doubtfire as both a Nanny and a shoulder to cry on.With hilarious consequences Daniel has to keep up appearances for the Social Worker, His Boss, His kids and of Course Miranda.Brilliant Make-up and the comic genius of Robin Williams, bring Mrs Doubtfire to life, in this tale of Compassion, Trust and Comedy.A really entertaining movie, to be enjoyed by the entire family.8/10",Mrs. Doubtfire

But Mrs. Doubtfire has something for both adults and kids. There are one or two swear words but not enough to wreck the story or make it inappropriate, very little crude humor, excellent acting (one of Robin Williams' best roles) and beautiful (and at times funny) soundtrack.Daniel (Robin Williams) is a loving, caring father, absolutely adored by his three children. The problem is, his wife Miranda is all business, whereas he's a fun-loving, imaginative and at times childish voice actor. When he throws a huge party in his expensive home for his son, featuring a petting zoo, cake and ice cream and the latest hip-hop hits, with his excuse to Miranda being, ""it's not a toxic waste dump, it was just a party!"" she becomes fed up with his antics and files for divorce, tearing the kids apart from their father except on Saturdays.Daniel is heartbroken, and misses his children. Meanwhile Miranda gets straight to work turning them against him by going on about his ""dirty apartment"" and teaching his youngest daughter the phrase ""damned"". She tells Daniel that she's going to hire a housekeeper for the kids, and Daniel seizes the opportunity, deciding to sign up for the job himself. With the help of his gay brother and his incredible voice acting, Daniel disguises himself as an elderly Scottish lady - Mrs. Doubtfire - but keeping his double-life a secret proves to be more difficult than he thought it would be, especially when Miranda gets a sleazy boyfriend named Stu.What else can I say? My dad downloaded this for me when I was a kid and it was right up there in my favorites along with Uncle Buck and Gremlins. Not only was Robin Williams an amazing actor but the acting was great from all roles, and I've got to say, my favorite scene was where Daniel, while dressing in his Mrs. Doubtfire costume, is seen by two boys from the other apartment. They giggle at him, thinking he's a woman, but then he turns around and scares them so they call for their mom. In panic, he drops his old lady mask and screams, ""oh sh!t"", making the two boys laugh even more. Ten a truck runs over the mask! It's only one of the many hilarious scenes in this movie.I highly recommend this movie (if you're worried about its content you may want to watch it yourself first, though). I wish movies like this existed today, there was talk of a Mrs. Doubtfire 2 coming out but sadly Robin Williams committed suicide so I guess it's been canceled. At least this one exists so other children (and adults) can enjoy it for many more years to come.",Mrs. Doubtfire
61,Howlin Wolf,Papa's got a Brand New Handbag.,7,20 August 2007,"I know it sounds strange to say about a male stand-up comic disguised as a middle-aged woman, but this part plays better when it's more restrained. Underneath all the trademark Williams mimicry there's a rather touching story of a family finding some stability again, but this is often on the verge of being lost amidst segments that feel like hollow promotional stunts. Personally, if I never have to see that clip of Robin Williams dancing to Aerosmith with a vacuum cleaner again, then I won't be sorry. Ignore the advertising, though, and there's still enough worthwhile moments in the film to send most people away happy.Williams is convincing and poignant when he's being low-key. Both Field and Brosnan help to keep proceedings moderately realistic, too. Some of the most genuine laughs in fact come from Daniel as the ex-husband struggling to conceal his dislike of the new fella in the house.If you can cope with a lack of subtlety every now and again, then this is an excellent film to enjoy with the whole family.",Mrs. Doubtfire

63,Screen_Blitz,A charming family comedy with both laughs and a heart-filling message,8,3 March 2016,"There is no doubt that Robin Williams was a crowd favorite in the 1980s and 1990s. Spending most of his career bringing smiles to many faces in America, Williams was an actor who made fans laugh hysterically, and at other times left fans shedding tears. This comedy directed by Chris Columbus stars Robin Williams in one of his most memorable roles, that brings both laughter and a few fears to the eyes of fans everywhere; a comedy sparked with an important message about family. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard, an eccentric San Francisco actor who performs voice of cartoon characters on television shows. On his home from a stressful day at work, Daniel picks up his children Lydia (played by Lisa Jakub), Christopher (played by Matthew Lawrence) and his youngest Natalie (played by Mara Wilson). Daniel has very loving relationship with the children, but a marriage with his wife Miranda (played by Sally Field) that is dangling at the edge. Arriving home, Daniel throws a birthday party for Christopher, much to the disagreement with their mother due to his poor grades. When the party ends in disaster, Miranda comes to conclusion that their marriage is not working out and files for divorce. Miranda is granted custody of the children with Daniel only allowed to see them on the weekends which is proved to be hard for both him and the kids as they've grown so close to him. When Miranda calls and seeks out a babysitting service, Daniel with the help of a make-up artist, disguises himself as an elder lady and poses as a babysitter for the children.Robin Williams brings such significant charm to the titular character, and his performance and wittiness may it quite difficult to help but enjoy his portrayal as his character. From the minute he poses as Mrs. Doubtfire, he delivers such pleasant laughter and charm to the film, and thanks to the incredible hair and make-up design, he is truly convincing as the old lady with a man who just wants to spend quality time with his children behind the mask. While this film brings on some great family-friendly laughs along with a few edgier gags, it is also very touching and conveys plenty of themes that contribute to serious discussions about family and relationships. With the main character and his wife's divorce playing a key role in the story, the film sends a strong, heart- filling message about being there for your family when they need you, and this spawns some emotional and occasionally tear-jerking moments. The story tackles on strong issues that many viewers can easily relate to, but at the same time, brings a cherishable chemistry between the characters and laughter that is hard to resist. The characters are nicely written and very likable to where viewers hope for the best in them. Mrs. Doubtfire is a heartwarming movie that you cannot help but love, thanks to the blissful writing, director Chris Columbus's creative mind, and an impressive comedic chemistry by Robin Williams. This movie is strongly recommend to children, teens, and adults alike; it is filled with just about everything Robin Williams is remembered for.",Mrs. Doubtfire
64,Rabical-91,A blessing in disguise!,10,16 February 2018,"'Mrs. Doubtfire' is one of my favourite comedy films of all time for many reasons. For one, it was directed by Chris Columbus, who has worked on classics such as 'Home Alone' and 'Only The Lonely', for another reason many of my favourite songs such 'Walk Like A Man' by The Four Seasons and 'Luck Be A Lady' by Frank Sinatra comprise the soundtrack but the main reason of all is that it tackles a very important issue, the affects a marital separation can have on a family. The late Robin Williams was the man ( or lady....or man... or......oh forget it! ) for the job as Daniel Hillard, an out of work actor who takes on the task of housekeeper for his estranged wife. Though highly popular on its release, some critics gave it a right hammering. One poor fool compared it unfairly to Dustin Hoffman's 'Tootsie'. Apart from the fact that the two lead character's dress up in drag, I see no similarities between the two films whatsoever.Daniel Hillard is an out of work actor who following his resignation from his job is to be divorced from his dragon of a wife Miranda. He manages to secure himself another job as well as getting himself a new apartment but is only limited to seeing his children once a week. Desperate to see his children more regularly, he disguises himself as an old woman and applies for the job of housekeeper at Miranda's house after she advertises for help. He goes under the name Mrs. Doubtfire and manages to endear himself to the children. However it is only a matter of time before the act is blown.Well, what can one say except it is brilliant from start to finish. Robin Williams is hilarious as the lead character, particularly in the scene where his false boobs catch fire when he is trying to cook. Sally Field makes for a suitably snobbish Miranda. Also doing a good job are Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence and Mara Wilson ( who later landed the leading role in the big screen adaption of Roald Dahl's 'Matilda' ). Also appearing in supporting roles are Pierce Brosnan, Polly Holiday, Anne Haney, Harvey Firestein and Robert Prosky.Having been the victim of a broken family ( my mother and father divorced when I was 10 years old ), I can relate only to well to 'Mrs. Doubtfire'. The affects of a divorce can have a deeply devastating affect on a family and I feel that Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon ( who wrote the script ) really nailed it. It also shows wonderfully just how far some parents will go to have time with their children.Some years ago talk was rife of 'Mrs. Doubtfire 2' but it thankfully never came to anything.

65,ProjectAnomaly,Mrs. Doubtfire,9,2 October 2019,I love how a movie that could easily be hard to watch (no!! They can't find out and they got so close!) was made funny and deep at the same time.,Mrs. Doubtfire
66,Beta_Gallinger,An unforgettable dramedy in which Robin Williams really shows his talent,8,31 January 2010,"I was only seven years old when this PG-13 rated dramedy came into theatres, and I think its existence went unnoticed by me until very early in 2007, when I saw it on TV. Just before watching it, I knew it starred talented comedian/actor Robin Williams, whom I was a big fan of, and knew it was about his character disguised as a woman, which certainly sounded promising for a comedy. My first viewing of ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" was definitely not one to forget, and I got more than just laughs out of it. After that, my second viewing three years later didn't disappoint me at all. My opinion on Williams as a performer hasn't changed since 2007, and watching this movie again turned out to be a lot like the first time.Daniel Hillard is a voice-over actor who quits his job after an argument with his boss. He is also the loving but irresponsible father of Lydia, Chris, and Natalie. Just after quitting his job, he throws a chaotic, disruptive, out-of-control birthday party for Chris. After his wife, Miranda finds out about this, she is fed up and decides it's time for a divorce after fourteen years of marriage. Daniel goes to live in an apartment, and gets to see his kids once a week, every Saturday evening, but this is not often enough for him. When he learns that Miranda is looking for someone to hire as a housekeeper, he decides to take advantage of his voice and acting skills, and creates himself a new alter ego, a sixty year old woman named Mrs. Iphegenia Doubtfire. In his disguise, he applies for the housekeeping job and gets it, so he now gets to see his offspring every day again. This goes well, and being Mrs. Doubtfire turns out to be an educational experience for him, but how long will he be able to hide the fact that Mrs. Doubtfire is actually Daniel Hillard? With the opening sequence, showing Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) in the studio recording his voice-overs and then getting into an argument with his boss and quitting, the movie is off to a good and comical start. It stays fairly consistent throughout, with many memorably funny scenes, such as the birthday party, Daniel doing numerous voice impressions in front of social worker Mrs. Sellner, the divorced father having to change back and forth from Mrs. Doubtfire to himself while Mrs. Sellner is in his apartment, Stu Dunmeyer (Miranda's new love interest) calling Daniel a loser in front of Mrs. Doubtfire (not realizing it's him) and getting fruit thrown at him, and many other things that happen on the main character's little adventure, as well as some funny lines coming from his alter ego. Most of the drama in this film was also well done, with decent dialogue, and there certainly are some poignant scenes. Both the humour and the serious parts help keep it interesting. Williams shows not only his comedic talent here, but also his acting abilities. Most of the other cast performances are decent enough here. There was something I didn't like about the two older Hillard kids, Lydia and Chris (not sure how to describe it), but they certainly could have had worse family characters in this movie.This was directed by Chris Columbus, and I haven't seen every film he has ever directed, but have seen ""Home Alone"" 1 & 2 (written by John Hughes), ""Stepmom"", and the first two Harry Potter movies. I haven't seen those Harry Potter flicks in years and don't know how they compare, but I would definitely say that ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is superior to the other three films I've seen from Columbus. Of course, these movies all had different writers, so it wasn't entirely Columbus who made them what they are, but it's interesting to compare this film with ""Stepmom"". Both films involve family trouble, and are apparently supposed to be a mix of comedy and drama, but the 1998 release fails in both genres, with a fairly poor script and generally unlikable characters, and I really don't think either of those can describe this 1993 dramedy! This one may have its flaws, but there's still so much to make it satisfying, even at just over two hours long.",Mrs. Doubtfire
67,Stampsfightclub,Williams is brilliant,8,4 July 2008,"Robin Williams (Good morning, Vietnam) stars as Daniel Hillard, a man who loves his kids and a man getting divorced. Now the only way he can see his kids regularly is if he pretends to be a qualified nanny.15 years on from its release, it's still a great watch, with fun characters and a bizarre yet extraordinary story about a lovable man who will literally do anything to see his kids.One thing that I have noticed on watching this film many times over the last decade, is that the humour is never lost, particularly not on Williams part. His acting in timing and tones of voices are exquisite and precise, one of only a few comedy Oscar winning actors who can do such a thing. And though the writing and sheer idea of the plot is brilliant, a sensational lead was required to do justice and make the film one of the best family flicks ever created.This 1993 Oscar winning comedy drama fills the genre brilliantly, and is a tremendous sit back and enjoyable family film with something for everyone. The children are likable, though the acting is off key.Sally Field (Forrest Gump) and Pierce Brosnan (Goldeneye) have their moments in a pretty conventional love story, though with a few good twists and Mrs Doubtfire the bit in-between.The direction and lighting are good, as are the settings. But it's the dialogue and the sheer idea of the film that makes it great. There were rumours last year there was to be a sequel, or a spin off. I personally hope there is nothing added, as this felt so much like a one off and the classics should never be meddled with.",Mrs. Doubtfire

70,Vivekmaru45,My Favorite Robbin Williams Film.,10,2 December 2010,"Robin Williams gives us his best in this film. It seems that the role was meant for him. He has a granny-type face and with a wig over his head - et voilà the transformation is complete!This is an emotional film as well as a comedy. We feel deeply moved as Robin's character in the film is forced to take steps to be united with his children and at the same time look for a new job as well. He balances these tasks with incredible finesse and this should be seen to be believed. The love he feels from is children is warm and heartfelt. It seen that the happiness of his children is all that he wants in life and we see it during the court scene near the end of the film.The film has its phases: a comedic opening and a sacking, fight with the wife and eventual separation, beginnings of a transformation, the complete transformation and moving in with his kids plus dramatic change in lifestyle(!), fight with his wife's new playboy boyfriend (played by the handsome Pierce Brosnan) and eventual discovery of his identity. Then we have a court scene at the end..... and well..... all's well that ends well ???Now the ending of the film disappointed me. Is there no compromise and can't a couple rediscover themselves again and restart their married life again? NO! But is is the fashion in an American society - if you don't like your spouse divorce and get another and another and another till either of you DIE OF AIDS (or something like that). Marriage is NOT A JOKE but a pairing of two souls that is sacred (remember the saying till death do we part?). Breaking that bond is an INSULT TO GOD.Even in the most extreme of situations divorce can be prevent by marriage counseling.Those of you that are married for many years can appreciate what I am trying to say. God created the first man, Adam. Then God created Eve from Adam, and he named her Woman as she came from Man. Then he gave her to Adam to be his companion, friend and lover (his wife), and they were the first couple on Earth.MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL.",Mrs. Doubtfire
71,itamarscomix,Still fun,8,19 December 2011,"Mrs. Doubtfire made a huge splash when it was released, but faded quickly. Robin Williams' star, which was shining bright in the late 80's and early 90's (Good Morning Vietnam, Dead Poets Society, The Fisher King, Hook and of course Aladdin) gave the film a huge boost, but he followed it with a string of one disappointment after another (Toys, Nine Months, Jumanji, Jack, Father's Day, Flubber) and by the time he finally made his Oscar winning performance in Good Will Hunting (1997) he was considered an actor well past his prime; worse, he was really getting on people's nerves.None of which helped Mrs. Doubtfire, which aged badly as it is. On the surface, it's just Williams doing one shtick for 90 minutes. The jokes that were daring and almost raunchy in 1993 seem very tame now, and what's worse, the way the film deals with the subject of parents divorcing - which was surprisingly straightforward for a family movie at the time - seems naive today.It's easy to criticize this film - everybody's been doing it constantly over the last two decades. But it's difficult to not enjoy it. Cynicism aside, Mrs. Doubtfire is, undeniably, a very funny and yes, very touching movie. Robin Williams and Sally Field both play characters who are very real and very likable; their relationship feels real too, and they have strong on-screen chemistry. The whole film, in fact, far-fetched and absurd though it may be, hits very close to home, and it's sincerely touching - because the viewer really cares about the characters and their relationship. It demands that you set aside your cynicism and criticism, but it's a lot of fun to watch even now.",Mrs. Doubtfire
72,russem31,ABSOLUTELY hilarious!,9,2 December 2005,"This is such a great film! It is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The main reason for this can be summed in 2 words: ROBIN WILLIAMS! This actor is a hoot. Unlike many actors in my opinion, he can be very versatile - great at both the dramatic and comedic. In this case, he takes on the double roles of Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire in equal and realistic strides. Even when he is in the makeup as Mrs. Doubtfire, whom the audience all know is really Daniel Hillard, I was able to suspend disbelief because of Williams. Kudos also to Sally Field and director Chris Columbus, whom I both love in their respective films. Without giving much of the plot away, I hope I convinced you to see this! HIGHLY recommended!",Mrs. Doubtfire
73,bellino-angelo2014,Great comedy both hilarious and moving,8,29 October 2019,"To this day, MRS DOUBTFIRE is considered both one of the funniest comedies from the 1990s and one of the most iconic movies for folks that grew up in the 1990s. And after re-watching it after a very long time, I can see why. It succedds in blending both comedy and drama without losing touch with the seriousness of the plot. Now I can go to the plot.After a birthday party gone awry, Miranda Hillard (Sally Field) divorces her husband Daniel (Robin Williams). Not satisfied, she also separates his kids since he loves them very much. So for passing time at home without being noticed by his former wife, he dresses up as a nanny and passes under the name of Mrs. Doubtfire. And he succedds in staying more time with his kids.So, why this movie is still loved to this day? The performances are all good: Robin Williams gives one of his most both zany and touching performances ever as the title character while Sally Field's character can become easy to hate especially in the first part. A pre-007 Pierce Brosnan as Field's new beau is pretty good. The direction by Chris Columbus of the first two HOME ALONE installments is good, since he knew how to capture Williams' exuberance and zany personality, and also most of the most humorous scenes for the movie. I really laughed at the restaurant part towards the end.However, I have no complaints at all about this movie since this is one of those movies that no matter how many times you watch it, you can't stop loving it. Worth recommended.",Mrs. Doubtfire

75,rebeljenn,"Story has flaws, but it's pretty funny",5,6 February 2006,"'Mrs. Doubtfire' is a pretty funny film, but it really does not have anything else to offer other than Robin Williams dressed up as a female Mary-Poppins-style maid to try to get his wife and children back, while he cracks a few jokes. One of the biggest problems of this film was the lack of understanding as to why the wife's new love interest was so unworthy. Come on, he seems like the perfect man, if there is such a thing. Why would anyone want to feel sorry for Robin Williams for throwing it all away with his wife and children for being irresponsible? Okay, okay, he really cares about his children, but that other poor man... Anyway, as you can see, this film is more about the comedy than it is about a developed story.

As far as I'm concerned, the worst bit is that it's American! I have always thought American humour was pretty unsubtle and in-your-face, but this is nothing short of pathetically insulting. However, let's try to be a little bit objective here. IMDb ratings are worldwide and this gets 6.8. Therefore, I'm seriously considering hiring a private detective to see if he can find my sense of humour because it was certainly absent when I subjected myself to this garbage. This is the kind of low-budget film that truly proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one.",Mrs. Doubtfire

Made almost a quarter of a century ago, it still delivers great humour, sentiment and basic truths about the reality of modern family life. We see a well-meaning and decent mother played by Sally Field, trying to manage her professional job, three children and a loving husband and father played by Robin Williams. The trouble is that Williams can't seem to get his life together, even though his children are his heart and soul. When the two are forced to split, Williams, an actor and comedian, uses his talents to make sure he remains part of their life. The persona of Mrs. Doubtfire, which he creates, lends a welcome stability to the family's domestic life. But the mother's new romantic interest in Pierce Brosnan throws a wrench into things. More fun comes when Williams has to switch from one role to another to keep the whole massive trickery from falling apart. In the end, the family has learned a few things about what is required to grow and change amid their new understanding for one another. A wonderful movie, hilariously funny.",Mrs. Doubtfire

Children and parents alike will love this film.,10,6 February 2010,"You know when you read something like, ""Fun for the whole family"", and you're like, ""Yeah right"" well, this film actually is. The kids will love the talented Williams playing a divorced father who disguises himself brilliantly, convincingly and humorously as an old English nanny; while the grown ups will be shocked at how crude the film actually gets, but can't resist laughing and continuing to watch. The film disguises R-rated-like humor by mixing in family fun which could be criticized, but shouldn't because it's actually fun and harmless. Brosnan and Field are wonderful as supporting characters, and the two actually are memorable in their performance despite being upstaged by Williams at his best. The three children are strikingly convincing in their roles and cease to fall into the category of painfully cutesy brats that Hollywood typically casts. The story is long but solid; the climatic sequence is saddening but genius and true. Despite Williams having to be so theatrical in the title role, the film itself seems a bit modest. This should be at the top of every critic's list of ""greatest family films"".**** (out of four)",Mrs. Doubtfire
79,Isaac5855,"Robin's Most ""User Friendly"" Comedy....",8,13 December 2005,"Robin Williams is a gutsy daring performer who likes to take chances as a performer but every now and then he goes strictly main stream, trying to reach the broadest audience base possible and he accomplished this in spades with MRS. DOUBTFIRE, a delightful Disneyesque comedy about an out of work actor who disguises himself as a woman (thanks to an Oscar winning makeup job) in order to be hired by his ex-wife (Sally Field)to be housekeeper to his kids. Williams delivers one of his most on-target comedic performances,much of which I'm sure was improvised. The scene with Anne Haney in the employment office where he does all the different voices I'm sure came right off the top of Robin's head as did his private kids' show in the empty TV studio with the toy dinosaurs, but even on script, Williams makes this work and has you routing for Daniel to be reunited with his children (and how adorable was Mara Wilson in this movie?). Sally Field plays the thankless role of the somewhat callous ex with sincerity and Pierce Brosnan is charming as the new man in Field's life. Harvey Fierstein also provides chuckles as Daniel's gay brother who provides him with Mrs. Doubtfire's look. A charming and funny comedy the whole family can enjoy together.",Mrs. Doubtfire
80,Movie-12,"Emotional and funny, one of the most vivid character studies ever. ***1/2 out of ****.",9,7 February 2000,"MRS. DOUBTFIRE (1993) ***1/2Starring: Robin Williams, Sally Field, Mara Wilson, and Pierce BrosnanDirected by Chris Columbus. Written by Leslie Dixon and Randi Mayem Singer. Running time: 125 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sexual references and some language) By Blake French:	""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is one of the most invigorating, vivid character studies to be produced on the big screen this decade. Most of the characters are strongly executed with decisive dialogue. They are also beautifully written with tainted personalities and uncompromising wit. Chris Columbus has assembled a stellar dramatic comedy with excellent screen writing, giving audiences one of the most punctually artful films I have ever witnessed.	The opening scene is as brilliantly structured as screen writing otherwise comes. It has a middle-aged man named Daniel, whom we learn about as he quits his job as a vocal performer for a children's cartoon after he realizes his employers are immoral. This sequence provides us with a development of the character's inner personality, strong morals and consciences. The audience also leans that he is a silly, easy going person. We soon find out it is these characteristics that propel the movie into the first plot point.	Daniel's wife, Miranda, wishes to divorce him because he is too goofy and immature. We are propelled quickly into the firm second act after the divorce. Before this point, we have witnessed both actions and dialogue reallocating Daniel's love and compassion for his family, especially his children. The film sets up the for following events using Robin Williams character as the plot advancer.	Daniel lusts for time with his children so much, he confidentially disguises himself as a sixty year old woman then applies for a day-care job for his ex-wife--this would allow him to be around his children more often. Miranda falls for it, and the master of disguise gets his opportunity. The film then takes us through a hilarious and emotional journey into the lives of a typical American divorced family.	The internal problem becomes more complex when Daniel's ex wife shows romantic interest in a new boyfriend, underplayed by Pierce Brosnan. The filmmakers could have done more with the Brosnan character. Here, he seems developed with repetition and dialogue. Although his purpose is to accommodate romantic competition, we don't know enough about him to care that much.	""Mrs. Doubtfire"" contains some material that fairs as overly blunt and outwardly apprehensive. Although the overall presentation is understandable and relative, I still think the picture could have been better with more careful script writing. Even such, we are able to witness a powerful, touching film with a conclusion that is so settling, you will cry with joy.Brought to you by 20th Century Fox.",Mrs. Doubtfire
81,Laakbaar,"Robin Williams tour de force, with a few issues",6,12 August 2014,"Daniel Hillard (the late Robin Williams) is a wacky and unreliable actor. His wife (Sally Fields) gets sick of it after 14 years and decides to divorce him. He's a great father though. To see his kids every day, he cooks up a crazy plan to pose as a female nanny. His gay brother (Harvey Fierstein) helps him with the disguise.His plan works. He immerses into his increasingly elaborate British nanny persona, becoming a more stable and responsible person in the process. He is also able to spy on his ex-wife and her loathsome boyfriend Stu (Pierce Brosnan)and gets to be with his children (who learn the secret). Then, one night, he has to go to a job interview as himself and attend a family dinner as Mrs Doubtfire -- at the same restaurant. Will he be able to pull it off? This was a funny, enjoyable enough family movie, despite the cross dressing theme and often ribald humour. Williams is talented and hilarious, as usual.My partner enjoyed the film; I had a few problems with it. The movie almost didn't work for me. It was too contrived how crappy everything got for Daniel after the divorce. Also, I was simply unable to suspend my disbelief that his wife and kids wouldn't immediately see through the disguise. (I don't know why this didn't bother everyone else.) And after a while, the shtick of him having to change back and forth under pressure became tedious and unrealistic. The costume was too much for this to happen. The movie became too slapsticky. Nice sweet ending though.",Mrs. Doubtfire
82,asda-man,The best comedy. Ever,10,20 August 2012,"Right from those opening musical moments of ""Peeegaro!"" A smile immediately transcends upon my face. I must've seen ""Mrs.Doubtfire"" at least 30 times in my lifetime (I'm 17 now) and it still manages to make me howl with laughter every time. That's what I call replay-value and durability. It does not get boring! The great thing about ""Mrs.Doubtfire"" is the fine balance between comedy and story. There's a great human story which is what makes the comedy work so tremendously well. The characters are fleshed out so that we're all rooting for Daniel Hillard and desperately hoping that he doesn't ever get found out. It's the story about the rise of a man, who only wants to see his children, but goes about it in a very extreme and hilarious way.The screenplay is absolute genius. It's one hilarious gaga after another and on top of that you've got Robin Williams looking like a 60 year old woman delivering the lines! You only have to look at him and burst into laughter (I do). Robin Williams is absolutely perfect in the role and the moment where he gives the hard-faced Mrs.Selner a preview of all his talented voices perfectly demonstrates why he's the best man for the role.There are countless classic, funny moments throughout ""Mrs.Doubtfire"" that makes it two hour running time go in a breeze. The finale is also a comedy tour-de-force with Daniel having to battle his two identities whilst getting very drunk. The introduction of Pierce Brosnon's character, Stu is also genius. It's hilarious to see Mrs.Doubtfire getting jealous of his, especially at the pool. I'm laughing now just thinking about it.Mrs.Doubtfire also has some incredible lines such as, ""Stu, more of a thick soup than a name"" and Robin Williams makes the preposterous idea somehow believable! If you haven't seen ""Mrs.Doubtfire"" then shame on you because your missing out on my favourite comedy ever! It's pure comic genius that will have you howling with laughter. I can guarantee that. Unless your a miserable git.",Mrs. Doubtfire

84,CinematicInceptions,Perfect ending with traditional Williams comedy applied generously throughout.,7,13 October 2014,"The main role in this movie was practically tailor made for the late Robin Williams. Daniel Hillard basically *is* Robin Williams in literary form. Daniel's personality has all of the eccentricity that Williams has become known for. His performance in this movie is easily in the top three that I have seen. The storyline is very good for a comedy. For those of you who are considering viewing, the plot consists of Robin Williams' character being separated by his three kids by a divorce and disguising himself as their new nanny to be with his kids. The villain that comes in partway through adds well to the plot. Stu, played by Pierce Bronson, is a rich guy who starts dating Miranda, Daniel's wife played by Sally Field, after the divorce. I honestly don't think they could have cast Pierce Bronson for the part if it had been made after he became James Bond because there would have been such a gigantic amount of potential for Danel to make Bond references that it would have taken up too much of the movie. He is introduced more for humorous purposes than emotional ones, since most of his screen time involves Daniel, disguised as Mrs. Doubtfire, trying to inconvenience him. As it is, Stu is a fairly small character in the whole scheme of things since Daniel is just trying to be with his kids again and not his wife, The kids are the main roles apart from the parents. Each one's personality is well developed and it is clear that they have a strong averseness to the divorce and go through all of the struggles that come with it. That said, the fake nanny that Daniel disguises himself with the help of his brother helps all five of them deal with the divorce better. The whole family's quality of life improves after he begins watching his kids incognito after school. Of course, as this is a comedy, everything that happens is mixed with humorous situations. There are several scenes where Daniel forgets that he is dressed as a seventy-five year old English lady and even a couple where he has to switch egos in rapid succession to save his secret. There is also a pretty good showing of Williams vocal versatility. The opening scene where he is acting for the cartoon is the first of these, followed by his job interview with the social worker, and later when he impersonates the many different prospective nanny's responding to his wife's advertisement (this by the way is one of many scenes in older comedies that would not work after caller ID had been invented). The social worker becomes a minor character introduced for humorous purposes as she checks on Daniel's state of living for the divorce court case. The only other minor character of note is Mr. Lundy the TV producer, who comes in late. In the climatic scene at a restaurant where Daneil is supposed to be at dinner with his family as Mrs. Doubtfire and with Mr. Lundy as his real self at the same time, Daniel accidentally forgets to switch costumes and quickly explains that Mrs. Doubtfire can be the host for Mr. Lundy's new TV show. There isn't much more to address apart from the ending. I don't think anyone would deny that it is the perfect ending for the movie, which is an incredibly rare thing to find in a film. It doesn't work to have the parents get back together because it is clearly shown that they want what's best for their kids and the two have too many discrepancies for this wish to be fulfilled. It also is not aesthetically appealing to have Mrs. Doubtfire continue to watch the Hillard family after her identity is revealed. All sort of seems lost at one of the most emotional scenes of the movie when the court decrees that Daniel can only see his kids under supervision, which is obviously unfair and not how you want to end a movie. So when we discover that Daniel will now take care of his kids after school without a disguise, it pleases everyone who wants a happy ending along with those who don't want the ending to be completely implausible and corny. This is rounded perfectly with the clip from Mrs. Doubtfire's TV show as the final shot fades out. As usual, I will end with recommendations. If you have liked any other popular Robin Williams movies, you shouldn't be disappointed. If you don't mind a good plot accompanied by continuous humor, it's a good watch. The story should please most speculators, so the only reason any given viewer might not like this movie is if the style of comedy doesn't appeal to them, which is a blameless crime. Overall Rating: 8.6/10",Mrs. Doubtfire
85,funtasticfour,I miss Robin Williams...,9,28 March 2020,"When Robin died, it was one of the saddest moments ever. He was a hero to me comedically and the fact that he was suffering from depression was so tragic. This movie is one of his greatest performances, up there with Aladdin. Not a wholly original story but made better by him. A truly fantastic movie that I was happy to rewatch on Disney+",Mrs. Doubtfire
86,DavidSim240183,A man in drag comedy that really drags,4,25 July 2007,"Men in drag is not exactly a new thing when it comes to comedies. Some Like It Hot and Tootsie both did the theme as well as its possible to get. Films that were witty, snappy and almost impossible to dislike. And then along comes Mrs Doubtfire. A film that wanted to be Tootsie for the 90s and didn't even come close.Certainly casting Robin Williams was a wise move. His talent for rapid-fire impressions and lightning-quick transformations makes him ideally cast. And the makeup work is pretty impressive. But I think the problem I have with the film is I just couldn't buy his reasons for wanting to disguise himself as a woman.In Some Like It Hot and Tootsie, the men in those films were forced to don drag through desperation, and it made their situations that much more believable. Mrs Doubtfire is aimed squarely at the level of simplistic melodrama. Robin Williams gets divorced from his wife, Sally Field, and poses as a housekeeper so he can keep seeing his kids. That's not desperation. That's insanely contrived plot mechanics. The type of thing that only happens in films. Not real life.I think another problem is director Chris Columbus. Columbus, for all his success as an A-list director, is not a particularly great filmmaker. At best his films are amiable fare, but I have yet to see one film on his resume that is remarkable. Certainly Mrs Doubtfire is nicely made and very polished, but its also overlong, and it doesn't really know what to do with itself. The film would have benefited from some tighter editing. The scene when the kids realise who Mrs Doubtfire really is could have been left out altogether as it has no bearing at all on the rest of the film.Mrs Doubtfire is a rather predictable film too. You can see where Williams' character, Daniel Hillard is going in terms of growth. He starts out as an inattentive husband, and as Mrs Doubtfire he realises his shortcomings and changes his ways. Columbus is known for portraying characters in clear colours of black and white. You hardly ever find a shade of grey in his films. Well, except maybe for one.There is one thing Mrs Doubtfire gets right, and that's Pierce Brosnan's character, Stu. Stu is the new boyfriend going out with Daniel's ex-wife, Miranda. Daniel can't stand him, and has to suffer in silence as he watches this rich and successful man romance his family right out from under his prosthetic nose.It could have been a lot easier for Stu to have played as a one-dimensional villain. Like a smarmy, silver tongued devil who hates the kids making it that much easier for us to sympathise with Daniel. But Brosnan is a good enough actor to invest a real sense of likability and depth into the character, and seems a decent fella who might just be good for the family after all.The downside to this is it makes it that much harder to like Daniel. We're supposed to be sympathetic with Daniel's plight, and having him make snide comments to someone who is really a nice fella just makes him seem petty and selfish. And its an approach that sits at odds with Daniel's supposed emotional growth.Another question to consider is the comedy. Is it all that funny? Well Robin Williams gives another of his energetic performances, and you still can't help but marvel at the way he improvises comic routines out of thin air. But Mrs Doubtfire doesn't quite match up to some of Williams' finest performances in Good Morning Vietnam, or Dead Poets Society. And he overdoes some of the shtick to irritation. Case in point being what should have been the film's ultimate comic set-piece. A scene in a restaurant, where he must be in two places at once as Daniel and Mrs Doubtfire.Like I said earlier, this film is overlong, and that is exactly the problem with this scene. It goes on for far too long, and having him dash back and forth between dinner tables soon gets tedious. What it needed was a more energetic pace to help things zip along. But Columbus is stuck on autopilot.Mrs Doubtfire doesn't quite plumb the depths of Williams' later forays into sentimental schmaltz. At least the ending is partly realistic about divorced couples. But still, if I were Miranda I would have had Daniel carted off to the loony bin after his bizarre antics. Not giving him full visitation rights to their children. Mrs Doubtfire is OK for a chuckle, but if you'll excuse the pun, its not that hard to drag yourself away from it.",Mrs. Doubtfire

90,EthanBJones_03,Some funny moments but not worth your time overall,5,10 June 2017,"'MRS DOUBTFIRE' was directed by Chris Columbus and stars Robin Williams, Sally Field and Lisa Jakub. ​After a divorce results in David Hillard(Robin Williams) only seeing his kids once per week, David decides to embody Mrs Doubtfire, a happy go lucky nanny who applies to be the nanny for his kids. But as his normal persona and Mrs Doubtfire collide in everyday life, things begin to spiral out of control.I think this movie deserves the award for the most mental concept of a film. This movie beats of 'Armageddon' and 'Face/Off' for that title for me because, if you look into the psyche of David, it's the most random and absurd premise of a movie ever. Robin Williams tries his very best as Mrs Doubtfire and provides some wicked one liners that can make your stomach hurt. On the flipside of that, his performance of David Hillard was very weak and any of his slapstick comedy was very weak and poorly done. This movie is certainly one way to pass the time but I could think of a dozen better ways to spend it.The actual story for this movie is very bland and it contains weird subplots and arcs that are never finished. It's very slow starting off and only gets interesting 20-25 minutes in, perhaps. The ending is also overly sappy and they REALLY hammer in the message. Granted, it's a good message but they could have been a LOT more subtle. Sally Field was perfectly passable as Miranda Hillard but neither impressed me or directly annoyed me. She was present and performed her role perfectly well. I honestly despise the children in this movie. They are annoying and serve no real purpose other than being motivation for a character. Their performances were pretty weak and none of them were enjoyable or entertaining to watch on screen. Pierce Brosnan was dull and bland as Stu and also served no real purpose to the story. The 'villain'(yeah, I'm calling them that) was very weak and also did nothing other that irk Hillard. This movie is technically proficient. The costume design is marvellous and Mrs Doubtfire is genuinely fantastic. The set design was fine but could seem a little generic and bland at certain intervals. The movie was competently shot and I have no major complains other than some dodgy editing and overly long shots at points in the movie. This movie is entertaining and definitely has some moments that could make you cry with laughter. These moments are too few and far between. Williams' tries his best to keep the movie afloat and does deliver some hysterically funny one liners but aside from that, it was just an okay movie. Nothing was particularly impressive. If you've got nothing else to watch, see it. You will have some level of enjoyment but aside from that I cannot recommend it. I'll rate it 5 Psychotic Fathers out of 10.",Mrs. Doubtfire
91,roghache,Wonderful buxom British nanny hilariously captures your heart,9,11 March 2006,"For me, this was the funniest movie I ever saw. Not normally a huge fan of comedy, I was just about rolling in the theatre aisles during this gem. Robin Williams is brilliant in his 'dual role' as the rejected husband, Daniel, and the buxom British nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire.This movie tells the story of a bitter separation, when Miranda insists on a divorce from her immature, goofy husband. Daniel, denied custody and given only limited visitation, concocts a female nanny character for himself in order to gain daily access to his three children. The kids grow to love and depend on their unusual but very concerned and efficient new nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire, who really gets the household running extremely smoothly. Of course meanwhile Miranda has a new love interest named Stu.Williams' portrayal of Mrs. Doubtfire is hilarious in every way, shape, and form. The wig, stockings, dress, make up...it's all too amusing, watching Daniel transform for the part. Wait till you see Mrs. Doubtfire cooking! The most insanely funny scene is at a restaurant where Daniel / Mrs. Doubtfire must quickly be in two places at the same time, so he / she is forced to alternate between personae at lightning speed, sometimes forgetting which one he / she is at any given moment. I won't give away the plot, but I nigh expired from laughing.Sally Field charmingly plays Daniel's now separated wife, Miranda, and Pierce Brosnan is suitably unsympathetic as her new love interest, Stu. We cheer for Daniel through his assorted antics as he tries to shoo away this romantic competitor for his ex wife's affections and especially, this new male threatening to usurp his role as father to his kids.Desite being a comedy, this film does on the serious side reveal the devastating effects of divorce on children's lives and also particularly on the noncustodial parent. Daniel is distraught as he misses seeing his kids every day. Furthermore, the entrance of a new love interest naturally adds to the general strife.Where did Mrs. Doubtfire get her unusual name? Does she live on or fizzle out at movie's end? Will Daniel and Miranda get back together, or will Stu prevail? I won't divulge any spoilers, but I guarantee you'll fall in love with this lovable large nanny and wish you could have her babysit your own kids. Mrs. Doubtfire will certainly live on in your heart.",Mrs. Doubtfire
92,DavidYZ,Ridiculous and unfunny,1,20 April 2017,This sentimental nonsense isn't realistic. Its attempts at humour are pathetically lame. The plot is preposterous - a divorced father pretends to be a woman in order to be employed as a housekeeper in the house of his ex-wife and their children. As if none of them would notice that it's him!,Mrs. Doubtfire
93,mdm-11,Divorce need not end mutual parenthood,8,21 May 2005,"With a strong will to suspend our disbelief, we can get past Robin Williams ""not fooling ANYBODY"" when he does ""granny drag"" to get hired as housekeeper by his unsuspecting ex-wife. This is the only way he gets to spend some time with his children. There are many funny moments in this movie, but just as many times where we get to think about what divorce means to all those involved.In Mrs. Doubtfires words ""...sometimes mommies and daddies still love each other, but they just can't live together anymore"". It's OK to have divorced parents; still better than to live with married parents who can't get along. My favorite scene is the ""walk-by fruiting"" of the Pierce Brosnan character. Sally Field is lovable as always as the mom who can't take another day of her husband's childish antics. A family pleaser, and an excellent platform addressing an important issue.",Mrs. Doubtfire

This, along with Aladdin, is one of Robin's best movies. I've met some people who didn't care for it, but to me this movie is touching and funny. What's not to like? Some say it's a poor man's Tootsie, but it works just as well as Some Like It Hot; maybe even a little better because it's more family-oriented. But if you want a good movie that deals with divorce, has an interesting plot and some good actors and actresses, and takes place in one of America's most celebrated cities, this is just what the doctor ordered!",Mrs. Doubtfire

97,dy158,Funny and touching.,8,23 July 2006,"I had always know why I saw this last Friday on the cable after I came back from my classes. I had heard of the movie before and heard it's funny.It's actually more than that, as I was watching.What would a divorced man do to get his wife and family back? It seems more ways than one. Daniel (Robin Williams) does voice-overs for cartoon and he quit when he and the production team cannot agree on the direction the cartoon is going. His wife Miranda (Sally Field) is a successful career woman, but always very strict in her three children's upbringing. When Miranda returned from work and found out that how the house had turned into given her husband had threw a birthday party for their son, she knew it's the last straw.Soon Daniel found out that his estranged wife needed a housekeeper to take care of their children and Daniel decided to do a female voice over the telephone, trying his luck and saying 'she' is Mrs. Doubtfire. It worked and he asked his friends to help him to look like a real woman. But the wife never realised it though at first.One can expect how the wife felt she realised she was being taken in all along that the female housekeeper...is actually a he. And her estranged husband even. Also at that time, Daniel is on the verge of hosting a children's TV show and when one day she saw her estranged husband (dressing up as Mrs Doubtfire) on the television, she knew what she had to do.Humour aside, it is also touching as well.",Mrs. Doubtfire

Golden Globe Winner for the part, Robin Williams (Dead Poets Society, Good Will Hunting) himself  is a very nice person indeed. The Julliard graduate, actor is extremely talented and funny. But with all its funny parts I think that a father having to disguise himself as a woman to see his children is a very sad situation. I recommend the movie, and hopefully you will be able to concentrate on the funny parts of the movie more than I did.

101,zac-04879,"Fantastic, Unforgettable and Very Pleasing",7,16 July 2021,"Robin Williams is definitely just as hilarious as dramatic as both a loving father and a caring nanny in this loveable comedy made with heart. Dealing with divorce, Mrs. Doubtfire is a heartfelt family movie with a very interesting, funny and unique storyline. Whilst it's targeting a watch for families with older kids, it'll bring plenty of powerful emotions to your face and will surely reach and touch your heart.What this comedy-drama does best is it portrays a well-thought plot and deep messages throughout. Mrs. Doubtfire doesn't exactly promise to entertain everyone, but those who stick through will find it worth a viewing. It also may not fascinate young kids aged 10 and under just because it's another film that picks up its pace whilst moving through, meaning it probably won't grip younger kids.The film mainly provides laughs, but you'll also never forget the dramatic, poignant and passionate side of it.

105,kyle-cruse,Funny movie,8,12 September 2008,"Robin Williams dressing up as a woman and playing nanny for his kids is the perfect idea to make a very funny comedy. Williams plays ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" (wearing an Oscar-winning makeup job, one of many roles before ""Good Will Hunting"" that could have won him an Oscar). Williams' smooth comic delivery and brilliant portrayal of a 60-year-old woman is hysterical here, making a very enjoyable film. This is similar to ""Tootsie,"" with some scenes, such as Williams putting on his female disguise, that look like they came right out of that film. This movie, however, does not have quite the same laugh-a-minute feel that ""Tootsie"" had, for several reasons. First, though it is very funny, this movie has the heavy topic of divorce looming over it, with the parents (Williams and Sally Field) arguing in just about every scene together. Also, one disappointing thing about the movie is the fact that it had the perfect plot and potential of being a great family film. However, the sexual humor, profanity, and the PG-13 rating would make this inappropriate for a number of family audiences. Nevertheless, even with its flaws, it is a very funny film, particularly the scenes with Williams changing back and forth to himself and Mrs. Doubtfire and the restaurant scene toward the end. Worthwhile for just about any lover of good comedy. By the way, some TV stations edit this film to remove the profanity and make it more suitable for families, if you think your family would be interested.*** out of ****",Mrs. Doubtfire
106,Irie212,The fatal flaw in Mrs. Doubtfire,3,27 December 2009,"Question: Since all the working wife (Sally F.) asks of her unemployed husband (Robin W.) is to behave like a responsible parent and help raise their three children, why doesn't he just do it? Instead, he accepts a divorce first, and THEN he does it, but not as himself, not as the kids' father so that he could spare them the suffering endured by children of divorced parents-- not to mention forgoing the divinely healthy pleasure of being their father. No, theatrical buffoon that he is, he'll only be a responsible adult if it's a role he gets to play, dressed up as the elaborately costumed Mrs. Doubtfire. In drag, bizarrely yet predictably, he instantly becomes an exceptionally responsible caretaker, housekeeper, playmate to the kids and psychologist to the mother.The answer, of course, is: no movie. But this movie is dishonest from the get-go, and insulting. It's a stage for Williams to do his lip-chewing sweat act, with Sally Field and Pierce Brosnan there to allow him to chomp his way through broad burlesque with adults as well as children.",Mrs. Doubtfire

So clearly I live the movie a lot as you can tell. But I am gonna tell you why it is such a great movie that everyone should watch. The acting, characters, characters development, plot and story line are all so greatly done. You could tell that mrs. Doubtfire cares about his kids a lot and just want to be around them. Robin william did a good job acting as a person who loved there kids so much that when the divorce happen he pretend to be a women babysitter so he a Could still be around them. That was done so well. This is a family friendly movie and so far one of the best things I have seen robin william act in. The movie is funny and silly but also serious at times too. The director did a great job making this movie. You could tell he put his all into the movie. I highly recommend this movie to everyone no matter the age.

I never get tired of watching this movie, in fact I just finished watching it on HBO.The best part of this movie is when the family goes to the swim club with Stu. Mrs. Doubtfire, who is jealous of Stu because he thinks Stu is trying to steal his family, throws a piece of fruit at Stu while he isn't looking. When Stu turns around Mrs. Doubtfire blames it on an ""Angry Chef"". That part really made me laugh.Another really funny part happens in the restaurant right before Mrs. Doubtfire is revealed. Mrs. Doubtfire and Daniel are both supposed to be in the same restaurant at the same time for different occasions. Robin Williams is constantly running back and forth to the woman's bathroom changing his clothes to be both people.

The cast of this is full of cult classic actors who fill their roles perfectly. The acting is top notch where you feel every emotion under the sun. The character of mrs doubtfire is a perfect fit for robin. This is by far one of robin Williams memorable hits.Story:
What a hilarious story on paper and even more so translated to film. The story of parents splitting up with all the trials and tribulations that are involved is very heart felt and relatable to some. You feel a sense of care and tragic sadness throughout the movie. The sadness is accompanied by one of the best comedians to have ever lived, robin William's. The dialog, and character itself seemed tailor made to Robin's acting and I couldn't help but laugh so much at every joke on screen. Every joke hit its mark and every scene was more bizarre, funny and interesting than the last. The ending was also very heartfelt, I had to hold in a tear.Summary:

110,AnishMisra,Mrs. Doubtfire review,9,1 January 2018,"Mrs. Doubtfire is a film directed by Chris Columbus. I came to know of this film because of its Indian remake Chachi 420, which I loved by the way. But after seeing this film I can say that this one surpasses the Indian version.Plot: Daniel who is going through a divorce with his wife Miranda decides to dress up as a nanny as an excuse to meet his children.Story and direction: This film very quickly introduces us to Daniel and his life. We see Daniel quite concerned about the kind of shows he does voice work for. Which was a brilliant way to comment on what is actually being sown on TV to kids. After that we see how much he loves his kids and how he is ready just to make them happy. This love is kept constant throughout the entire film. Never a single moment is there, where you feel this love is less. Same can also be said for the kids, wherein they miss their Dad a lot. Miranda's character also draws an instant connection as she being a working other who can't give time to her children. You can see that she wants to spend time with the children but due to her work she can't give time. The film also explores how creative Daniel is with the dinosaur act he does and the channel executive wanting him to do a show. Stuart Dunmayer was a great addition to this film. His character to adds some spice to this comedy-drama. The ending may have got many disappointed as it wasn't the kind anyone expects in this kind of film. I would say that I liked the ending as it was something different and remainedtrue to the father-children relation shown. The make up deserves an applause. I mean every time Daniel appears as Mrs. Doubtfire it was as if I was seeing an actual 60 year old woman. No wonder it got an Oscar for the makeup category. The only issue I felt was with the angle of children and Stuart Dunmayer. The film didn't show that the children are either happy or sad of Stuart's presence. I would have been happy if they would have addressed that in the film.Peerformances: Robin Williams is everytime missed. He did great in the dual roles of Daniel Hillard and Mrs. Doubtfire. I also think he perfected the English accent. Sally Field was also great in her role.Pierce Brosnan was also good as Staurt Dunmayer. He did justice to what was given to him. Roberty Pronsky was also good as Lundy. All the 3 kids also looked very genuine in their performances.Favorite Scene: The scene where Daniel and the court liason meet in Daniel's home and Daniel says Mrs. Doubtfire is her elder step-sister. I was laughing out loud in that scene. Also the acting prowess of Robin Williams was clearly seen in this scene.Verdict: I enjoyed this film and if you want to see Robin Williams in his best, this is the perfect film.I am goung to go with a 9/10.",Mrs. Doubtfire

112,jake-law123,A nostalgic favorite of mine.,8,17 February 2015,"I've seen this film so many times it's unreal. It's an addicting gem of a comedy that's not to be forgotten when looking back on the late Robin William's filmography. One of his most well known characters of all time and one of the biggest family fun comedies of the 90's.Daniel Hillard, (Robin Williams) copes with his divorce from his wife, (Sally Field) by disguising himself as a nanny who works for her so he can be near his kids. He not only betters himself, but learns to be a more responsible parent that he lacked when he was married.I love this film, plain and simple. Robin Williams brings out all his comedic talent in almost every scene, including voice acting, mugging, shockingly insulting, etc. His makeup job is fantastic, and he is the perfect person for it.My nostalgia out of the way, it's a clever comedy that builds on the awkwardness of each scene to which he meets his wife's new partner, almost getting caught, not being cut out as a nanny at the beginning, etc. The music by Howard Shore is simple but pleasant. The film never really drags, it's long, but appropriately. The film doesn't really go too in depth, it just simply lets Robin Williams be a goof everywhere he goes, which is what we came to see.It's a pleasant film overall. I will love it until death departs it from me, and Robin Williams will forever be remembered for it.",Mrs. Doubtfire

After this has wife has enough of him and decides to divorce him and, as he is too much of a loser for any conventional job, he dons the woman suit and becomes Mrs Doubtfire and high jinx and hilarious moments fail to materialise.This film attempts to cover the same ground as Tootsie, but whilst Tootsie went for touching humour and avoided many of the more obvious gag this revels in them. All of the leads are wasted here with Sally Field and Pierce Brosnan given standard roles with no enema or drive as Robin Williams is the wacky star and he should get all the good stuff in the film, however, the problem when you do this and the star fails to deliver is that you have a disaster on your hands and because Robin Willams character is so initially unlikable it instantly took the film away from me and put me on the back foot. The jokes here are lame and so predictable that it was really quite painful to watch. The film limps along with a predictable inevitability and when the last scene roles onto the screen I was squirming with the same kind of embarrassment one has when you here your parents having sex, you just don't want to be there or wish it would stop.Thankfully it did, but not till I had wasted an afternoon I could have spent out in the sun.Okay to watch if your no older than 12.",Mrs. Doubtfire

So open your home to Robin Williams and this here classic film. I'd also recommend Good Morning Vietnam, Clubber, Hook and a lot of others. Almost every movie he's in is a classic.",Mrs. Doubtfire

120,jamiecostelo58,Simply hilarious!,8,17 December 2006,"A true comedy classic, Mrs. Dooubtfire has never failed to raise a smile! Robin Williams is simply a legend, and provides many laughs and gaffes, but also showing his serious and emotional style. The storyline is very unlikely, but it's pulled off with extreme poise and conviction, and in a way can make us think of the consequences of a marriage in crisis, especially when children are involved.The young child actors are a pleasure to watch, and all three have proved successful in other movies and TV dramas. You can certainly see why when viewing Mrs. Doubtfire, while Sally Field and Pierce Brosnan also put in credible performances.An emotional ending left me a little disappointed, where you wish that they were all a happy family once again. However, Mrs. Doubtfire will definitely make you smile and make you laugh non-stop! A great comedy film!",Mrs. Doubtfire
121,wisemantonofski,The Family-est of Family Films,10,4 February 2019,"The comic genius of the great Robin Williams is given center stage for all to see in this story of the stresses and trials of a painful divorce on the family unit. The comedy is balanced brilliantly against the drama, painting a picture of a man retreating into humour to cope with what's happening around him, a perfect (if unknowing) allegory for the life of its tragic star. Built on a cast of genuine and believably likable characters and presenting the audience with no obvious villain to be overcome, Mrs. Doubtfire tells us that divorce doesn't always have a bad guy, that family is as much a part of the heart as any emotion and that Robin Williams truly was one of the greatest comic actors to have ever lived.",Mrs. Doubtfire

123,hoxjennifer,Fun for the entire family,9,10 February 2016,"If you're a 90's kid, there is no way that you can continue to go on without seeing this movie. Mrs Doubtfire is a classic, lighthearted fun-filled comedy that will produce laughs for all ages (parental discretion is advised - there are some subtle sexual references and mild coarse language). Daniel Hillard is a recently divorced man, who cannot bear to go a single day without seeing his children. Out of desperation, he disguises himself as a 60 year old British nanny in order to see his children everyday. What follows is cross-dressing, multiple identities mishaps and good old Robin Williams (bless his soul) humour. Mrs Doubtfire will make you laugh and bring you almost to tears at the same time, because underneath all the fun and games there is a powerful message about family and love that transcends separation or divorce. It is also a movie about second chances, about how sometimes people are better for each other when they're apart, and about learning from mistakes. It's a simple plot that is not too complicated to follow and shouldn't be interpreted for more than its face value: a simple, light-hearted comedy that tugs just enough at the heart strings.",Mrs. Doubtfire
124,wchngliu,"Fun For The Kids, But As A Film This Is Way Overrated",6,27 December 2007,"Robin Williams has starred in some good films: Good Morning Vietnam, Insominia; he also starred in a few unforgettable ones too. Mrs Doubtfire was a film I used to love as a kid- I first remembered that as soon as it came out on video, I snapped it up quick. I used to watch it over and over because I couldn't get enough of it, but as I got older, I watched Mrs Doubtfire for the first time in my 20s a few years back, and afterwards, I could never get my head around the hype of this movie, as I realised how unrealistic this portrayal of divorcée parents was. Miranda- played by a somewhat mis casted Sally Field- decides to divorce husband Daniel (Robin Williams), after enduring years of his mis haps and childish shenanigans, especially when she arrives home to a group of screaming kids messing up the house and discovering that Daniel has thrown a birthday party for his son, which descends into chaos.Daniel is devastated-, although he is just as devastated when he is told by the court that he can only have the kids once a week, which prompts him to turn to his gay brother and boyfriend for support. With latex, a cheap wig, a dress and a pair of stockings, he later becomes Mrs Doubtfire- a Scottish nanny, of whom Miranda hires to look after the children, whilst she goes off to work. Miranda gets a new boyfriend named Stuart, played by Pierce Brosnan and here he comes across as a somewhat slimy, two-faced piece of work. But he only gets a few lines and as Stuart, character-wise he was so pedestrian and almost one-dimensional.Mrs Doubtfire is a comical farce- but whilst Robin Williams efforts as Mrs Doubtfire are at times funny, I thought the circumstances that led to the couple's break up was, for a comedy, just ridiculous. Plus, the conclusion was rather out of sync and so far removed from reality. I understand that with divorce cases especially when kids are involved, there is hardly a happy ending. And whilst the last scenes did imply that there was some hope for Miranda and Daniel, the truth is they are no longer together as a couple and are no longer in love with one another. The ending was neither here or there-although it was realistic enough to be believed. In fact, the ending was much more believable than the other aspects of the film itself.The cast were at best okay: I've seen Robin Williams act better and do better than in this movie, I thought Sally as Miranda was too stuck-up and as I said earlier, she was mis-casted as that character.And by the way, Mrs Doubtfire was indeed Scottish, not English as the writers of the film have pointed out.Having said that, the gag's and jokes, whilst they were enjoyable for a few times, eventually became tedious and tiresome. The sentimentality of it became nauseating and the cutesy factor was short-lived. The younger ones will love it more, i'm sure but for a so-called family film dealing with the complicated issue of divorce, Mrs Doubtfire was at most sappy and saccharine sweet.Mrs Doubtfire is not Tootsie- it is nowhere as good as Tootsie; yes this film can be funny on occasions but in all, it just doesn't cut it. It is just a tad too long, too predictable and with some scenes, you often have to wait for some time for something really interesting to happen within the film.In all though, this is a rather bog-standard affair, with nothing remotely new to offer to the audience. It is a film about a guy who dresses up as a woman, in order for him to see his children. With Tootsie, it's about a guy- who like Daniel is an actor- who dresses up as a woman in order for him to secure a part in a daytime soap opera. That movie is far more substantial and interesting; some would say it is also funnier than Mrs Doubtfire, which is in truth more of a melodrama, rather than a comedy-based film.Mrs Doubtfire is at best very average, but it is way overrated and compared to Some Like It Hot and Tootsie, it trails behind by a couple of metres. It is a rehash of the cross-dressing elements of those films juxtaposed onto a family friendly context, but it is done in a not so successful and efficient way.This is really a poor man's Tootsie, and whilst it can be funny at times, it does come across as being banal and predictable for a movie that Mrs Doubtfire is.",Mrs. Doubtfire
125,CurtMan@LVCM.com,"A funny, genial, delightful comedic hit",9,17 September 2004,"""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is one of the most intelligent, eloquent and sincerely funny pieces of entertainment I have ever seen, succeeding on multiple levels with many delights which appeal to many audiences. So it is hardly a wonder this good-hearted comedy became one of the biggest and greatest comedic hits of all time. First of all, Robin Williams is ingeniously clever and right on the mark in his role as a desperate father legally estranged from his children posing as a domestic nanny. His voice articulation is brilliant: one would never perceive he is anything BUT an old, genial, eloquent Englishwoman, and nobody would think to question, behind the infallible makeup, that this woman is actually a man! The screenplay is excellent, providing charm, eloquence, and jocularity to an already wonderful and amusing premise. As previously noted of Williams, the acting is superb and totally convincing (Sally Field hits the mark as a confused, stressed, recently divorced mother trying to stay sane). ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" hardly never fails to deliver with its many moments of comedy (not too raunchy, not too fresh), messages of family appreciation (everybody needs a parent who cares), and whim (who doesn't enjoy a macho man portray a sweet old lady?). A delightful, sensational comedy that hits all the right marks. **** out of ****",Mrs. Doubtfire
126,n-mo,"Good and bad for children, a lot of fun with liquor",3,30 September 2007,"This movie requires the most outlandish suspension of disbelief, one that usually lends itself to children's movies, but there are two reasons why I could not recommend it for children: first, because such sloppy storytelling is insulting to their intelligence and cons them into believing that it is acceptable to write that kind of tripe, and second, because it portrays two apparently (and I stress *apparently*) solid people getting a divorce as though it were an acceptable solution with three-half grown children in the mix.And when I talk about suspension of disbelief, I do not mean Daniel's elaborate disguise, which is only slightly out-of-whack.No, what I mean is that we are expected to believe that Daniel and Miranda both genuinely love their children and want the best for them. Yet Daniel does not earnestly strive to force them to do better for themselves until he suits up as Mrs. Doubtfire. Clearly he is capable of being a positive influence, and in some way he must have been even before, since his children seem to love him so much--so what gives? Miranda's behavior toward her husband mirrors that of a woman on tranquilizers, yet she somehow holds a successful career and truly cares for their three children. Was she cheating on her husband? The swiftness with which she warms to the advances of her wily English client suggest so, but the plot and the dialogue--especially her confession to Mrs. Doubtfire--ask us to believe otherwise.Daniel's irresponsibility does not seem to breach that line of shirking his duties to his family. Or perhaps, unconsciously, this movie is a commentary on the refusal of modern fathers to act like men and the unworkability of two-breadwinner houses. Maybe they would have been much better off if he had remained a homemaker. But Miranda wanted it all: a solid, independent, successful career, a beautiful family, AND a powerful, manly husband who could protect and watch over her.But it doesn't really matter, because this movie does not concern itself with the dynamics of their EXTREMELY PETTY divorce. Nor does the conclusion, in spite of its pretensions to the contrary, nourish a belief in forgiveness and redemption. Nobody in this movie behaves honorably--and granted, nobody in real life ever completely does, but it is really sad to think that life necessarily becomes so miserable just because of a few petty flaws.",Mrs. Doubtfire
127,blairgallop7,A touching comedy full of laughs and fun for the whole family to enjoy,10,12 April 2008,"One of the best family comedies of all time,Robin Williams delivers humour that can make the whole family laugh or even cry.Robin Williams plays a struggling actor by the name of Daniel Hillard who is having marriage problems with his wife,Miranda(Sally Field).After their problems get worse,Daniel can only see his children once a week.Enter Mrs.Euphegenia Doubtfire who Daniel dresses up as in order to see his children.Pierce Brosnan also co-stars as Stuart ""Stu"" Dunmeyer who is a co-worker and a good friend to Miranda.I would have to say that this is one of Robin Williams' best movie's,if not,his best.He delivers comedy in this film like no one else could have done by using his trademark off the wall mimicry as well as dressing up in drag.Great job to the cast of this film,particularly Robin Williams.He had also won a Golden Globe-Best Actor-Musical or Comedy and the film won Best Motion Picture-Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes.Well done!",Mrs. Doubtfire
128,tmpj,Disappointing,4,7 March 2010,"Before I begin, let me say that I am very much a Robin Williams fan...but even every film he makes can't be a total knockout. The last film he made that I loved was ""Patch Adams"". I may be somewhat behind the curve since I no longer follow current movies closely, and hardly watch TV at all. ""Mrs Doubtfire"" is sort of ""Tootsie"" 'light'...Dustin Hoffman's predicament was a tad more believable than that of Robin Williams. And, sad to say, I think Hoffman really had the last word when it comes to comedic farce such as this attempted to be. I found it to be quite boring, and the story line was exceptionally weak...and contradictory. Why should Sally Field break up the marriage because she came home form work and her son was having a birthday party? That's ridiculous...and I have to wonder what kind of Mom would respond in that way to her son's 12th birthday? So what if there was a petting zoo outside and a ""people zoo"" inside. It's the kid's birthday, for crying out loud. I just wasn't buying it. Then, for Robin Williams to take the 'Sir Galahad' stance he took when, as a voice over artist, one of the characters puffs away on a stogie...an implausible situation...I cannot think of an animated cartoon...old or current...where a character smokes anything--other than say a pipe for an older character, or a cigar for a gangland type. It may happen with cigarettes, but it certainly is the exception rather than the rule . And this position loses credibility at the end of the film when, at a dinner engagement, Doubtfire insists upon a smoking rather than non-smoking booth in which to dine. The humor is so forced--because the situations are beyond absurd and not likely to occur in the fashion presented--that the wind is taken out of the comedic sails of his passion, and it is so predictable that one can very easily become distracted or indifferent as I did when trying to watch this very difficult to watch film. The lackluster direction of Chris Columbus contributed, no doubt, to the boredom of this celluloid catastrophe. He has no pacing, no comic timing, and it seems that any an opportunity to make this film a true vehicle for the screwball comedy of Robin Williams is wasted because the director did not seize upon opportunities and situations. This Christopher Columbus needs to discover something different...he needs to discover ""comedy"", in all of its variant forms. Williams and Fields are much heralded performers, but their skills and talents are wasted in this feeble attempt. I watched the film once, and I would not want to sit through it again. Nuts to ""Mrs Doubtfire"".",Mrs. Doubtfire

130,AzSumTuk,"Loved it as a kid, but now...",5,12 February 2019,"I guess when you're a kid it's easier to put yourself in the shoes of the kids in this movie - they love both of their parents and are really happy that their father is willing to do anything to be with them, they love being allowed to go wild, and so on...But when you're closer to the age of the parents, you begin to realize that no mother of three will want a person like Robin Williams' character in hers and her kids' lives. It is one thing to throw a memorable birthday party for your kid. It is a completely different thing to throw a party so wild that it puts most frat parties to shame, when your oldest daughter is in her early teens. Partying is one thing. Allowing - and even encouraging - kids to break stuff is a different thing. So is letting farm animals walk free in and around your house, and so is getting the police involved. If you were Mrs. Hillard, would you stay married to a manchild who's just put your kids' lives in danger? Because that's exactly what Daniel Hillard did. And would you tolerate a creep willing to impersonate a woman just so that he could be around your kids? While there were many funny gags in this movie, Daniel Hillard was shown as an emotionally manipulative person, and an actor so good that he could fool even people who'd known him for years. He was not shown as a trustworthy person, though - and that judge was right to rule against him.Sorry. Robin Williams was a great actor, and this used to be my favorite performance of his.

This is a rarity in family films--a movie in which no one is perfect.  Everyone in this movie makes mistakes, and everyone learns from them.  (For example, the rivalry between Williams and Brosnan develops because each has prejudged the other, leading to humiliating and ultimately devastating consequences for everyone.)  Sure there is some silliness, but, as with everything in life, none of it is without consequence.  For those who have already seen this movie and considered it a simple comedy, I ask you to view it again with fresh eyes.

Suffice to say that this is a good film with great lines and delivery by Williams. The three kids are perfect and Pierce Brosnan is also well cast as the suave good looking stud that gets Sally Field all discombobulated and disconcerted at every turn.

It's just that kind of film- you know what you're going to get, and for people who like that sort of thing, it's great. My big problem with it, though, is that the central premise is Robin Williams being an actor who can ""do voices."" Unfortunately - as great an improviser as he was, and for all his talent and humanity - Robin Williams was not a very good actor. And on top of this, the Scottish accent he does is absolutely appalling. And THEN, we discover that it's not even supposed to be Scottish, as Mrs Doubtfire is English, from England. Marvellous example of 90s Hollywood being wonderfully ignorant of the rest of the universe. Speaking of 90s Hollywood, it must be said that I derived a great deal of pleasure from the wardrobe and set design. I also thought it was a wise choice to make Brosnan's character a decent guy who obviously cared about Sally Field and her kids- would have been far too obvious to make him a greasy villain. Anyway, I really didn't like this film at all. Not just because it was the sort of film I don't like anyway; mainly because of Robin Williams' acting. Also the fact Sally Field mentions furnishing a property with a 17th Century piano, when they didn't have pianos in the 17th Century. A disgusting oversight, about which I'll write to my MP.

141,ron-fernandez-pittsburgh,A foodie,8,7 September 2015,"MRS. DOUBTFIRE really showcases Robin Williams talents. I was never a big fan of his, but in this one he's tops. Kind of a silly premise that works, again thanks to Williams performance and a very able supporting cast. San Francisco locations help as does a nice music score. Synopsis can be supplied by anyone reading most of these reviews. Despite some plot holes and improbabilities, this movie works on just about all levels. It's kind of a 'dreamy' as opposed to an all out in out comedy. Divorce and unhappy people are never a comic narrative, and the bittersweet ending works just fine. For those of you who are Polly Holliday fans (Flo in the TV sitcom ALICE) she has nothing to do here. She has fourth billing on a card by herself but only has one line of dialogue in one scene. In looking at the ""cutting room"" floor clips, she had a much larger part. Here scenes were kind of a sub-plot that was very funny, but entirely eliminated from the final edit. In a way I an see why as the movie runs over two hours at it is, and for comedies, that's along time. SOME LIKE IT HOT, the best comedy ever made ended right at the two hour mark. Perfect. Wonder what Ms. Hollidays fans and Holliday herself thought of this. Do see the extras if you're going to watch this movie on DVD.

The movie sports a few genuinely funny moments, Robin Williams being Robin Williams in one of his better roles (and at his peak), and the movie represents your typical 1990s comedy flair perfectly, blending laughs with timely messages about the realities of family life, not necessarily winding up the way the audience expects (Doubtfire's ""feel good"" ending not really so happy as we might expect, but then again, that's life).Daniel Hillard is a talented voice over actor with a moral compass and a loving father to his three children. When he throws a birthday party for his son without his wife Miranda's knowledge, she takes it as the last straw and divorces her husband. At the custody hearing, the judge only allows Daniel to see his three children every Saturday, definitely not enough time in Daniel's mind. When he discovers that his wife is looking for a housekeeper, he employs the help of his brother Frank to transform him through body suits, a wig, false teeth, make-up, and glasses into an aging English housekeeper dubbed ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" His uncanny acting skills put to the ultimate test, Daniel manages to get the job and fool his wife and children completely. He must deal with his court liaison, find a job, learn to accept (or choose to harass) his ex-wife's new boyfriend Stu and learn how to keep house, all the while maintaining his secret identity.It had been so long since I last watched Mrs. Doubtfire that I had forgotten the film was directed by Chris Columbus. As soon as the movie started, I could feel the Columbus touch even before his credit popped up on the screen. The only thing that seems to be missing is Macaulay Culkin as one of the kids. The movie screams 1990s through and through, though it is not my favorite comedy of the decade (not even my favorite Columbus movie of the decade, that title going to Only the Lonely). Still, Mrs. Doubtfire has its moments, mainly any time the Doubtfire character appears on-screen. Williams has definitely nailed the performance (and his make-up artists received a well-deserved Oscar for their work), his character rightfully a show-stopper. Despite the fact that almost every scene seemed important and added to the story, after the first hour or so I had to resist the urge to fast forward to the next scene featuring Mrs. Doubtfire.

I hope you watch this glorious film that is hilarious and heartwarming at the very same time, dears. It goes to show a fathers devotion to his children and also that divorce can be a painful thing. Sincerely, Mrs. Doubtfire",Mrs. Doubtfire
147,patomartinezfgo,"A hilarious, yet touching movie",8,13 August 2017,"Robin Williams unleashes his whole comedic talent in this classic comedy. Mrs. Doubtfire is one of those movies that you will be remember for a long, long, time.The story is about an unemployed and irresponsible Robin Williams who loves his kids with all his heart, unfortunately he can only see his kids once a week because of his divorce, to see them more often, he dresses up as a housekeeper and starts working in his wife's home.This movie is HILARIOUS! Robin Williams truly shines by doing all kinds of voices and impressions, as well as setting up some amazing jokes.The character of Mrs. Doubtfire is great, and she doesn't even look like Robin Williams, its amazing.The supporting characters also do a great job and are completely believable in their roles.The cinematography and editing is as good as you can imagine. The soundtrack was surprisingly enjoyable, and the makeup is great of course.But what really makes the movie shine is Robin Williams. There was truly, no one else that could fill this role. His performance is so hilarious and full of energy, and you can't help but smile when you see him. Of course, he is also great in the more quiet and touching moments of the film, he knows when to make you feel sad.The only problem I have with the film is that some things feel kind of rushed. Like the divorce, and some other plot points, which didn't get the necessary screen time, but it is just a nitpick. I am sure that an extra scene or two would have fixed the problem (maybe those scenes were just cut).You should definitely watch this movie, it doesn't matter if you love movies, or just want to watch something fun, just watch it.",Mrs. Doubtfire
148,kickstand,Put it out of our misery,2,29 January 2000,"I loathe this film because its immense popular success has persuaded Robin Williams to turn away from genuine humor to bathetic ""love me"" feelgood claptrap.As a film itself, Mrs. Doubtfire is an insulting piffle. Williams' kids wouldn't recognize their own father in theatrical makeup? That itself is the saddest thought in the film.If you want a truly engaging film for the family, rent ""The Iron Giant"" instead.",Mrs. Doubtfire

While some of the movies lines are ""inappropriate"", I still think that the movie is a Important and heartwarming film that every family should watch together. Despite the Films PG-13 rating, I don't really see anything inappropriate about the film. If anything people can watch the film to see the comedic genius that (was) Robin Williams. People can also learn a wonderful message from the form. No family is perfect, and sometimes families won't be together but that doesn't mean that there is no love. Love is sprinkled all throughout this film and that's probably what makes it's withstand the test of time. While Robin Williams is sadly no longer with us, his comedic timing and adlibbing of fantastic one liners will live on forever through Mrs. Doubtfire and so many other wonderful films. I encourage every family to watch this film together, it will touch your life forever.",Mrs. Doubtfire

151,johnfos,Success of this comedy never in doubt!,10,24 June 2005,"Divorce is usually no laughing matter but in this case family tragedy is laced with laugh-out-loud comedy as an elderly housekeeper comes to the rescue. The character of Mrs Doubtfire is created by Daniel Hillard, the peeved husband, so that he can see his children regularly.The irony is that Mrs Doubtfire is everything that Daniel is not. Time after time we see Mrs Doubtfire succeed where Daniel himself has failed -- particularly in terms of providing some sort of firm guidance for the children. And in terms of being a trusted companion for wife Miranda.On the lighter side, one of my favourite scenes is where Mrs Doubtfire is doing the housework to music: enthusiastically dancing and playing the vacuum-cleaner like a guitar. Another is where ""she"" is sprung going to the toilet standing up.Everything builds up to an amazing climax, with the scene at Bridges restaurant, where Daniel and Mrs Doubtfire must both appear at the same time. The action shifts from one side of the restaurant to the other and back again, as Daniel becomes the somewhat intoxicated quick-change artist and elusive dinner guest. In the end Daniel's cover is well and truly blown and Mrs Doubtfire is exposed as a fake. Miranda becomes hysterical and I will never forget the look on her face! Mrs Doubtfire is one of my favourite movies and Robin Williams and Sally Field play a great roles. And I like the San Francisco setting too.",Mrs. Doubtfire
152,chimera3,A True Childhood Favorite,10,12 October 2017,"I know that I was a kid when I was first introduced to this movie and I am glad that I got to watching it. I was, like so many other kids at the time, hooked on Disney movies and I didn't know much about Robin Williams until I watched ""Aladdin"" about three dozen times. After hearing him and then watching him in ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" it made me smile every time I heard him crack a joke or whatever.The late, great man plays Daniel Hillard, a voice actor with a rocky marriage to his wife Miranda (Sally Field) and three kids: Chris (Matthew Lawrence), Lydia (Lisa Jakub), and Natalie (Mara Wilson). When he quits his job because he aggravated his boss, he picks up his kids from school and treats Chris to an impromptu birthday party with all of the trimmings because he knows that Miranda won't be home......until a nosy neighbor gets the ball rolling. Miranda blows a gasket and utters the three magic words that no married person wants to hear (especially if they're a good spouse): ""I want a divorce."" So Daniel moves out and is forced to do some re-arranging of his life. That's when everything starts to change for the better when he answers a personal ad of hers regarding a housekeeper.When I saw him in the Mrs. Doubtfire costume, I couldn't believe what I saw. From what I hear, when he was on set in the costume and started talking like her, he actually had people believe that he was a woman. Anyway, the kids mature and become disciplined, as does Miranda...well, sort of. A big problem for Daniel comes in the form of Stu (Pierce Brosnan), a friend and co-worker of Miranda who wants to become serious with her after knowing that Daniel was out of the picture.When it all comes down to it, everything is eventually ironed out and the kids spend an equal amount of time with both parents. As a child of divorce myself, I can definitely relate. For whatever it is worth, it is a comedy-drama that you will enjoy with every fiber of your being. Whether you're a kid of divorce or of two stable parents, I assure you that you will love this movie. How can you ignore Robin's signature wit and Sally's vast array of emotions? Whether it is one that you remember or both, keep it close to you because you won't ever forget it. It is a shame that Robin is no longer with us. Every time I watch this movie, I have to hold back tears because that was the man that I remember as a kid who brought happiness to so many people. In the end, we must salute the man who brought us characters like the Genie and Daniel Hillard to life. God bless you, Robin.",Mrs. Doubtfire

The premise is very original and the movie has many great scenes. Some of the best: Hiding his face from the apartment inspector, using all his voices in one sitting, putting on his different faces, throwing the lime at his wife's boyfriend (Pierce Brosnan), and calling his ex-wife so many times in different character.

The famous Roger Ebert thought this film wasn't very funny and gave it a thumbs down in his review. It's not as great as Some Like It Hot or Tootsie, but it is still an enjoyable, hilarious family comedy that showcases Robin Williams' talent as a comedic and serious actor. It has good drama and comedy interspersed throughout. It's not my favorite comedy ever, but I still like it, I think it's quite good. Admittedly, I have a bit of nostalgia for this one since I was a kid when I first watched it, but even as an adult, I think the movie still holds up and is touching, heartwarming, and hilarious.

157,TheLastStop41,A great comedy with a powerful message.,7,16 February 2002,"Most comedies are underrated, and this one is truly underrated. Robin Williams is a great comedian, as good as Steve Martin, and in this one he really pulls it off. I hate to admit this, but if I were in Robin Williams position I would of done the same thing. Though this is a comedy, it does have drama in it. It has extremely good character development. Robin Williams and Sally Fields steal the show. The kids all that great except for Mara Wilson. Really the only thing the other two did was smile or frown, and say ""why can't dad be here?"" But besides that it is a real good movie and it's a surprisingly long movie, which comedies are usually about an 1:45. This one was over two hours, but it's certainly one the best comedies made, and I forgot by how much I enjoyed this movie. It's worth more than a 6.4, more like 7.0-7.5/10 maybe on the top 250 even, but not the top 100. Anyway, this a great comedy and I give a 10/10. The final showdown in the restaurant is worth to watch the movie alone. It's hilarious and extremely well done. I applaud you Chris Columbus!P.S. I know I rated, this movie 10/10, and I said it should have a 7.0-7.5?10, I meant for the average rating. Probably most of you figured that out, but some people were probably curious why I gave it too different ratings.",Mrs. Doubtfire

I went to the movies and seen this with my mother as a kid and it was so funny, yet it had an underlying message to it that should be appreciated by divorced parents as well. I get sad watching it now obviously because Robin Williams is gone. However, the spark that made him beloved by so many is on full display during this movie. It is undeniably a classic.",Mrs. Doubtfire
161,bug76,Funny but not for all ages,7,28 May 2011,"While I did enjoy most of this movie and enjoy Robin Williams' talents, the fact that this movie is labeled a ""Family Movie"" is a little disturbing to me. 1) as another reviewer had pointed out, deliberately putting pepper onto Stu's food, knowing full well he was allergic, wasn't funny. Food allergies can be deadly. 2) The use of God's name in vain that Daniel uses, especially in front on the youngest Hillard was totally out of line. How is that family friendly? Especially in another scene when she repeats that line to her mom is more than disturbing. Even if she was encouraged to use a slightly different word, how can they let a child even pretend to say it? Kids are impressionable, especially if they see another kid doing or saying something. It's amazing what movies are labeled for the family. But that aside, I did like watching this movie and even have it on tape, but I don't recommend it for young kids. If they had left out the bad language, food poisoning and sexual innuendo, then it would've been perfect for all ages. Sorry, Robin, but I knew it was you under that mask. Besides, ""Tootsie"", the only other male that could be 100% convincing as a old woman would be Jim Varney's 'Auntie Nelda', who BTW only wore a wig, glasses and make-up but didn't have on a new 'face'. 'Mrs. Doubtfire' was a costume worn just to see Daniel's kids. 'Auntie Nelda' was a part of the 'Worrell' family. But in seeing 'Mrs. Doubtfire', I wondered if 'she' was inspired by 'Auntie Nelda' since Jim and Robin were friends. No disrespect to Robin-who I think is funny-but I think Jim Varney's 'Auntie Nelda' was funnier. And without the use of bad language and sexual content.",Mrs. Doubtfire

I remember watching him as Mork and just ended up turning the TV off and went outside to play baseball with my friends...I guess he strikes me as an 'intellectual' comedian when all I wanted was W.C.Fields slapstick... Mr Williams best work was 'Good Will Hunting', he was actually quite good in drama, in most of his comedy work he is portrayed as the person everyone (except the villain) just loves and cannot get enough of, 'Good Morning Vietnam' comes to mind, he was a disc jockey in a war and everyone LOVED him... Am I missing something here, his rants in that film are almost embarrassing...OK, the guy is dead, but, Mrs. Doubtfire was awful IMO... He won't take a paying voice-over role for some lame reason, most people would be happy to just work... He throws a party for his kid that is soooo over the top, animals walking around the house, dancing on the table etc, I almost felt like calling Sally Field and telling her to get home quick! When she told him to take a hike I cheered for her, he was obviously in need of therapy for that episode... Then he turns into a desperate stalker/cross dresser so he can be close to his kids, he should have thought about that before he turned down jobs and exposed his children to his manic and sorrowful behavior....That is when I stopped watching this dreadful film and went outside to play baseball again... Like I mentioned in the summary, my kids liked it and laughed a lot, but then again they were young and laughed at almost anyone who acted stupid...",Mrs. Doubtfire

Robin Williams will always hold a special place in my heart as one of the greatest actors of all time and one of my biggest acting inspirations.

165,bettyconway,Hilarious and Moving Family Comedy,9,17 November 2020,"In the 90's, the divorce rate in America was becoming larger and larger and it made sense to try and tackle a tough issue like this in a way that the whole family could enjoy. Mrs. Doubtfire might just be the best film about divorce since Kramer Vs. Kramer.In the film, Robin Williams stars at Daniel Hillard, a voice actor whose freewheeling lifestyle angers his straightlaced wife, Miranda. After one extravagant birthday party for his son, Miranda has had enough and decides she wants a divorce. This leaves him with little time for his children thanks to a strict custody agreement, so he poses as an elderly female housekeeper in order to see his children more often.While Mrs. Doubtfire is often hysterically funny, what sets it apart from being just another man in drag comedy is the enormous amount of heart and real human emotion on display throughout. The filmmakers don't sugarcoat the anger and resentment that goes along with a divorce and how it affects the children in the family. It also doesn't sell out in the end and offer the audience a cheesy, sitcom-ready ending where everything goes back to the way it was. It's refreshing and all the better for it.",Mrs. Doubtfire

I think the relationship with Daniel and Miranda was played quite well. Being a divorced woman, I totally understood the situation the characters were going through. I also enjoyed the dynamics of the children aspect. You could see how much the kids loved their dad. Pierce Brosnan is simply too yummy in this movie. He is not only the best James Bond but the perfect eye candy in any movie. There were so many elements of humour in this movie that I appreciate. Of course, what could I expect from Robin Williams? He can switch his humour on and off. He made this movie for me. His ability to make me cry from just a look in his eyes, to laugh without saying a word, and to feel the hurt he was feeling by his body language.I recommend this movie to anyone.

Truly dreadful piece of garbageNever been a fan of Robin Williams, his attempt to deliver zany humour is nothing more than cringeworthy and this his worst example. I actually felt sorry for his fellow cast members in this as he attempts to pull face after face and deliver corny attempts at humour in this thin, pointless piece of rubbish.

Did we realize how unsympathetic,short-sighted, and selfish Amanda Hillard (Sally Field)was? Did SHE realize it? Life was all about how it affected her. And the kids--how long had they lived in San Francisco and NOT seen a cross-dresser?Second, between the close-ups on the kids and the ham-fisted socially progressive dialogue, particularly Mrs. Doubtfire's monologue at the end, the producers of this film must have become tired swinging those double headed hammers at our heads hoping we'd get their message. The script--and by extension the movie--is kind of like an ABC After-School Special and Lifetime Channel movie rolled into one.Now notice CAREFULLY that I have not mentioned Robin Williams' performance. His exchange with the social worker at his apartment, ending with a ""cake facial"" is nothing short of miraculous. It makes my wife laugh hysterically every time she sees it.",Mrs. Doubtfire

It has an interesting storyline of a man willing to do anything to be with his 3 kids. The film is not only hilarious, it is also touching and brings real life and unpleasant situations like divorce to the surface.

172,jsataluri,Robin Williams at his best,9,11 December 2005,"Probably one of his best known films in the 90s, Robin Williams is at his comedic peak here as he protrays a divorced, out of work actor desperate to see his kids. So he disguises himself as a nanny for the kids, when his ex-wife (Sally Field) is at work. And how he is able to maintain this as well as his own life and career is the rest of the story. This brings full of laughter when Mrs. Doubtfire is trying to cook for the first, or when the housekeeper is with him and he has to alternate between the two. However, this is pretty much a heartfelt story about a man who can't bear being separated from his kids and doing everything in his power to see them. Sometimes the film overdoes itself, but Chris Columbus is able to maintain the film between its over-the-top comedy and its deep message to families.Robin Williams is at his acting best, both comedic and dramatic wise. What can said that has already been said by others? He is a genius. Sally Field does well in a role tailor-made for her as a frustrated wife who can't stand her husband, but falls for the charms of Mrs. Doubtfire and begins to trust her as a friend. Everybody else gives great support. Good family film to watch when you're bored and need some light hearted humor. Williams in full form. 8 out of 10.",Mrs. Doubtfire
173,rtivey913,Charming Robin Williams comedy,8,15 June 2015,"Robin Williams is really a hit and miss guy. Sometimes he's in excellent movies, (Mrs. Doubtfire, Good Will Hunting, Aladdin, Good Morning Vietnam) and sometimes he's in mediocre and bad movies. (Flubber, Patch Adams, Jack, Bicentennial Man) This is one of his excellent movies.Robin plays a man named Daniel whose life falls apart after getting a divorce with his wife named Miranda and quitting his job as a cartoon voice actor. Having wanting to see his kids, he disguises as the family's new housemaid, and hilarity ensues when he reveals himself to the kids and tries to work with discussing a business meeting and his former wife's birthday at the same place and same time.This movie was quite the crack-upper. It was funny, sweet, and charming. How could I forget the dramatic moments? Daniel and Miranda never get back together, but Daniel gets to visit the kids whenever he wants because of a negotiation with a court judge. Meanwhile as his Mrs. Doubtfire persona, she hosts a television show that's basically the female version of Mr. Rogers, and answers a letter from a kid that's going through the same emotional problems as Daniel's kids.

174,pvilleguy,WIlliams overkill,5,17 May 2006,"There is bound to be an over-the-top element in any film where cross-dressing is a featured element. Therein lies a problem with casting Robin Williams in the lead role in a film where a man impersonating a woman is a key element. Williams already plays every role in an over-the-top, ""Im cool and you're not but you wish you were as cool as me"" manner. Williams's presence detracts from the story rather than adding to it. His insistence on making the characters he plays larger than life totally undermines the credibility of what might have been a cute little story. Williams's inability to portray subtlety is the undoing of this film and turns what might have been an entertaining farce into a monotonous, predictable bore. Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan and Joseph Prosky turn in credible performances in their roles, though there is really nothing extraordinary about any of them. An actor less pre-occupied with his own ""mark"" on the character might have made this the entertaining light comedy it was meant to be. This is not a bad movie for younger kids, though, if you don't mind explaining what Mrs. Doubtfire means by ""cunning linguistics.""",Mrs. Doubtfire
175,colebt33-780-179547,Cosy and funny,6,2 October 2010,"There aren't many good cross-dress comedies out there, that' why when a movie like this comes along, you have to appreciate it, despite whatever level of doubt may apply. Mrs Doubtfire is not the best comedy, and most certainly not the best movie, but it is a very heart-warming story about a father who is crazy about his kids, and when he gets a divorce he is willing to do ""anything"" to spend the time he needs with his children, including dressing up as a 60 year old woman.There are two major things that make this film an exception. There's Robin William's excellent display of his renowned voicing acting, and the heart-melting theme of the warmth and importance of family. There are so many occasions in this film where in one scene you want to break out in tears, and then in another, crack yourself with laughter. Mrs Doubtfire is one of those movies that you can cuddle up with at any time. The equal complexion of heart and comedy is a wonderfully touching and hilarious experience. It's something for the whole family, definitely worth the watch.",Mrs. Doubtfire
176,wrcong,Blah,4,28 December 2004,"If Dustin Hoffman can carry off a gender swap in ""Tootsie,"" I suppose Robin Williams can do the same thing. The problem: Robin Williams is no Dustin Hoffman. Sally Field (Miranda Hilliard) and the children pull off fine, understated performances, as does Robert Prosky as the TV station owner who gives Daniel Hilliard the opportunity to carry his cross-dressing act to children's daytime television. Pierce Brosnan (Stu Dunmeyer) is appropriately charming and stuffy as Miranda's new love interest with whom Daniel wants desperately to compete.The film, though, is all about Robin Williams. Some of the lines come off as improvised in the Williams staccato style of delivery, particularly when Mrs. Doubtfire is grilling Stu about what he expects to receive in return for the expensive birthday gift that he, Stu, purchased for Miranda.The difference between ""Tootsie"" and this film is that despite all the makeup, Robin Williams smug self-righteousness and penchant for being too hip for the planet (in his own mind) permeates every scene in which he appears. There is nothing in this film that wasn't done funnier in ""Tootsie,"" or even in ""Some Like It Hot.""

Here, Robin Williams is dressed as a 60-year-old lady as a way to see his kids, since his ex-wife, Miranda (Sally Field) has custody of them, at least, most of the time. There are a lot of scenes I practically laugh at. One part is where Daniel (or Mrs. Doubtfire-played by Williams) is at his apartment, trying to dress as the old woman, and two Oriental boys see him and are laughing at him. Another part is where all five of the main characters, plus Stu (Miranda's smoking hot boyfriend) are at the pool. Stu calls Daniel a loser, not knowing that the person whom he called a loser was right there. Daniel/Mrs. Doubtfire throws a fruit at him, and says ""some angry member of the kitchen staff"" threw it. Stu walks away, then Daniel makes a remark about a ""good waste of juice"" and someone *else* calls him a loser.

It was one of those movies dad enjoys to watch with his kids so he just put it on countless times. As a kid this movie never got old. Yesterday upon watching Mrs. Doubtfire again, I can safely say I can still enjoy this film past childhood. Robin William steals the show and the dynamic of him dressed as a 60 year old women with a British accent is actually executed rather well and it is super funny too. This film has heart, the story told is unorthodox but it's truly touching when you think about it. Although this film is funny and really enjoyable, it doesn't quite hit the mark everywhere. Mrs. Doubtfire has heart but it doesn't have compelling enough supporting performances that make you cry, it doesn't have dialogue that twists your stomach over the drama and emotion, it's just a light-hearted, crazy spin on a serious situation. The movie also has it's cliches and convenient moments that are also seemingly present in kids movies that often take me out of the film. All in all, Mrs. Doubfire is enjoyable, it's funny and it does carry heart. I would recommend this movie.",Mrs. Doubtfire
182,gordonm88,"It's Sally, Stupid!",7,21 January 2004,"This movie takes a hopeless premise,and mixes in two actors - Robin Williams and Sally Fields - who are so dissimilar in their talents that their pairing should be D.O.A., and pulls out a surprisingly funny and effective movie.  I am stunned at the quality.Understand that Robin Williams has very limited range to his acting.  See the opening scenes of Mrs. Doubtfire where he quits his job -dubbing voices into cartoons - over a trivial moral issue. Is the scene convincing? Does he appear to have the right level of passion to truly walk out on his job?  No. As an actor, he is merely Robin Williams in his films.  But his manic side really distinguishes him from any other actor alive.Sally Field, however, is a great actress (and greatly unappreciated, too.) She has the range to do almost anything - but cracking jokes is not her forte, and manic is not within her range at all.So what happens?  Robin is enormously funny when he is getting his makeup applied by Harvey Fierstein, gigging the court-appointed monitor, and tormenting Pierce Brosnan.  But in the Robin-only scenes, the film stands still -as if he is doing a stand-up routine.But when Sally is on-camera, the story moves.... and there is emotional power in the scenes.  She is dead-on convincing in almost every scene, in almost every emotional state.  She tells no jokes and creates a realness and a context that brings the best out of Robin's emoting.  There would be no movie without Robin, but it is Sally that makes the movie something much more than Three Men and A Baby.Even Pierce Brosnan works - in an unusual twist he plays a male version of the type of role that many gorgeous actresses are accustomed to play - his role is simply to be good-looking and charming so that other characters can be jealous or lust-filled.  And yet, even he shows 3-dimensionality to his character, with the help of some sensitive script-writing.So its a triumph - a genuinely interesting and fun film. Bravo!",Mrs. Doubtfire

Instead Robin Williams looks like someone in a mask . A bad Halloween mask . Couldn't they find someone who knows the least little bit about makeup ? If the makeup doesn't work nothing works . The comedy doesn't work . The sentiment falls flat . Everything hinges on believing the characters . Maybe if Mrs. Doubtfire caused everyone to laugh uproariously at the bad makeup job I'd be interested . Perhaps .The makeup job done on Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie was first rate . Sure , she was plug - ugly . But at least he - she had a human face .You want to talk about good makeup . How about Max von Sydow in The Exorcist ? He looked so realistic that he actually had a hard time finding work after the movie because everyone thought he was eighty years old . I didn't bother looking at the name of the "" artist "" who did the makeup on this movie . But could it be the same person who did the makeup on the Wayans brothers on the movie White Chicks ? I wouldn't be surprised .",Mrs. Doubtfire

And wrong accent Robin...",6,29 August 2008,"I wanted to see Mrs Doubtfire after seeing the hilarious ""call of nature"" clip on a list of 100 Greatest Family Movies. Nothing in the movie quite lived up to that scene but there are a fair amount of scenes that will raise a laugh. However I can't give this top marks because the attmepts to be ""moving"" often made me wince in embarrassment. The biggest gripe though is that Mrs Doubtfire claims to be from England yet speaks with a Scottish accent. It would be similar if an ""American"" nanny came to England and claimed to be from New York yet spoke with a Texas accent. Even a Brit would know the difference. Are Americans really unable to differentiate such different accents? Whether this is an oversight or intended for comedic effect isn't too clear. As a movie with a moral or message I can appreciate that it may ty, but often fails. As a comedy though I give it a casual thumbs up.",Mrs. Doubtfire

Anyhow, this is undoubtedly Robin's finest work and the best example of his physical and vocal comedy, the best example of his energy and improvisational skills all while reigning it in for the necessary emotional serious scenes and really pulls on your heartstrings (having grown up with divorced parents myself, this hits home harder than most)
It is a shame a sequel was never done but I'm so glad there's been no rumours of a reboot or remake as the charm would not be there especially without Robin with us

It is relate for married couple's on the verge of divorce.Mrs Doubtfire could be anybody connected to a married couple who are in their own corners sticking up for their own rights and seeking divorce.It is only when this fictional character with no seemingly blood relation to either couple, gets verbally involved and is listened to by one person in this couple that thinking begins to change.Although there are many light moments in this film, I saw no comedy, no offence to either actors.I observe that the very last people who should be talking during a divorce is the couple themselves, because each will always seek their own corner, and therefore get nowhere.Mrs Doubtfire is primarily a councillor for the wife, a friend, a house keeper, who observes what the wife does not want to see.There is a lesson here methinks.",Mrs. Doubtfire
188,Dario_Gino,Movie From A Critical Point of View,9,16 September 2008,Now there are some serious fans of Robin Williams that will give some biased answers but I will look at the good and the bad both. First this film was not to seem extremely realistic but funny with good morales being taught. The plot is about divorce and how children cope through an event. Now as a film for entertainment it is very good because of the comedic side (that's if you like comedy). As a film just to waste time on and do nothing it's not the film for you because there is lots of morale taught here and role modeling. As a film to help children I would say it is very good for Child psychology because Divorce for children is very difficult for them to understand and this film is good role modeling about the feelings children have. Let's look at the Pro's and Con's Pro's (Goods) 1. It is a movie with lots of good morales taught. 2. Is movie that raises hope for children 3. Comedy is done very well with much satire on the old idea of cross dressing. 4. The Actors are very good and experienced so their skill is brought into the film Con's (Bad) 1. There are a few slip ups on the camera but if you haven't watched it time and time again you won't notice it. 2. Somewhat demonizes the female or single mother. But this depends on point of view. Single mothers are just as good as single fathers Now this depends on your own personal point of view. Overall if you want a good comedy with some emotions and morals thrown in then this is a very fulfilling movie. If you want only comedy and no meaning and no lessons to be learned then this may not satisfy you. Personally this is a very good comedy and would be considered a family movie. I give it 5 stars but again this depends on what you want.,Mrs. Doubtfire

190,ANGEL-S,Warm and beautiful,10,17 March 2011,"Funny how movie ratings can seriously induce someone to think it is an average, dull, flat, seen-it-before, when in fact, there is no person in the world that would stay indifferent about it, and won't watch it again in a distant future at some point. This movie is absolutely under-rated here at IMDb.com.I remember watching it back in my teenage days and it was completely hilarious! Now, almost full decade or maybe more, not quite sure, it still captures me entirely. Strange how as a grown-up I focused on different things and noticed something I did not back then, up to a point it could be twisted far from what authors intended, but still, it is a very decent movie you won't easily find in Hollywood production these days.Mrs. Doubtfire (what a witty title I did not captured before, I come from non-English region) teaches about moral as something that looks damaged or lost in the modern days of our world. It teaches about true values that deflated over the course of speed progress and development. It teaches about relationship between a parent and a child in a most sincere and gentle way imaginable. It could be a true story. In fact, it IS a true story.My stomach couldn't be more 'tortured' with laugh last evening. Creators fully revealed their master skills, carefully exploring all the aspects of drama and molded them perfectly into this theatric play.As elusive the film's title can be, this movie is an absolute gem for many, without which film-making magic would not be the same. It gets deep into many levels of human relationships that you can see from a funny and radically new perspective that praise joy and life to it's highest.Robin Williams played one of his lifetime roles, he is among the most talented actors ever encountered, always consistently radiating no matter where appears. To quote a line, the God broke a mold after created him, and the rest of the crew/characters are seamlessly absorbed inside his limitless charm.""Oh, dear"", I believe already made myself clear - absolutely praise the joy of it's magic.",Mrs. Doubtfire

I remember seeing it when I was about 7 years old and I laughed a lot. If not for the witty humor, than for the fact that a man dressed up as a woman. I watched it several times every year and as I grew, I began to understand more and more of the adult humor. Finally I watched it again a few weeks ago and laughed harder than I did anytime I saw it. The story follows a father who after a divorce, is desperate to see his children. The only way to do this without getting in trouble from the courts is to dress up as the after school housekeeper. In doing this he finds himself in many tight situations with his ex-wife, a woman from the courts, and his new employer. On top of all of this, he is stuck dealing with his ex-wife's new boyfriend. Everytime I watch this movie I don't want it to end because I have so much fun watching it.

It could be that I've seen a few Robin Williams movies, and he seems to repeat himself a bit too much, maybe not.The main problem I have with the film, is it doesn't really fit well into any category in terms of suitable age viewing. I said I watched this on TV quite a bit, where 1.) It was edited and 2.) my mother was never happy about.The movie is a great family film in a lot of ways. There are plenty of things kids would find pretty funny, has some good messages, etc. However, there's also a lot that really shouldn't be in a kid's movie. Language, sex jokes, etc. none of which are very subtle.If you've ever seen The Cat in the Hat film with Mike Myers, you know what I'm talking about. It's got some stuff that shouldn't have been in there. So Mrs. Doubfire falls in kind of an area that suits really 13 year olds, and that's it.

199,KahnuevsKrake,"Funny, emotional and one of the few ""perfect"" films out there in my opinion",9,14 April 2020,"And by ""perfect film"", I don't necessarily mean my favourite, but the fact that it bangs everything it wants to be, right on the nail. The acting is fantastic, the characters are well balanced and the ending doesn't resort to Hollywood cliches.For a family comedy, it deals with pretty mature subject matter like divorce, parental rights and all the nitty gritty around it, but Robin Williams comedy genius makes the film funny enough to almost die laughing, yet it hits your emotional heartstrings pretty hard and you really want this family to be ok.Williams absolutely hilarious performance as Daniel Hillard is obviously the big star of the movie, but two performances I think are underrated, the first being Sally Field as the ex-wife, Miranda. While what she did in the movie was pretty horrible to begin with, but you can understand why she did it. It really is a breath of fresh air to see a film that shows both sides of the story, while you are supposed to root for Daniel and the deeply unfair situation that was thrown at him, he was a great father, but ultimately immature, irresponsible and needed to grow up. Any lesser a film would have completely vilified Miranda, but both characters grow in the movie.The other underrated performance is Pierce Brosnan as Stu, a guy who Miranda is dating. Again, his character is a breath of fresh air because most other movies would have portrayed the ""rival boyfriend"" as a complete jerk and/or guilty of something else just to hammer in how bad he is. While Stu never does anything particularly wrong, you still love to hate him, purely because you're rooting for Daniel.And finally, I love how they ended the movie on a bittersweet note. All in all, if you haven't already seen this movie, do it now. It's hilarious, emotional and a great family film for broaching the subject of divorce for kids.",Mrs. Doubtfire

201,Starfiremyst,Mrs. Doubtfire: One of Mr. Williams's Best,10,9 May 2008,"When Robin Williams is that much of an actor, he gave us all many good deeds including doing the voice of the Genie in the Disney cartoon ""Aladdin"" and such. Recently, he was playing the lead in the movie ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", which was released in 1993. You see, ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is about an actor who lived in San Francisco, California, and can disguise himself as a female nanny named Mrs. Doubtfire throughout the film.The movie opens with a four minute cartoon directed by Chuck Jones (of the ""Looney Tunes"" and ""Merrie Melodies"" cartoons, and not to mention ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"") called ""Pudgy Parakeet"" featuring the Chuck Jones versions of the ""Looney Tunes"" characters Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny known as Grunge the Cat, Pudgy the Parakeet, and an old lady doing the knitting, all voiced by Robin Williams.Somewhere in the movie, William's character goes to a TV Studio, where one of the sets featuring Prehistoric Life, and at that, he plays with some toy dinosaurs. Toward the end of the movie, William's character as Mrs. Doubtfire talks to a monkey Muppet named Kovacs (voiced by Chris Pray).The catchy songs they used in this movie soundtrack are interesting, including the song ""Stormy Monday Blues"" performed by B.

Lots of things distracted me from enjoying this movie in an easy and relaxed way, making me questioning the moral compass of the protagonist.The message this movie sends is questionable. You can be all sorts of irresponsible, immature, passive-aggressive (active as well), lying, deceiving b*tch, and have a good excuse if you did for *insert 'children' here*. Instead of finding a common ground with a *formerly* loved one, the protagonist chooses to deceive her and then enforce his possessiveness on her (in the episodes with her 'new old boyfriend'). That should make people think it wasn't just one case of birthday party chaos to ignite the fuse of divorce, it speaks a lot about his attitude towards his ex-wife.

207,babiedol12,Unique Comedy Movie,7,22 December 2004,"You know, we've seen it all before. Man meets woman, man and woman marry, man and woman have three cutesy kids, man and woman divorce, man dresses up as woman to be with his kids... Oops, hang on a minute.Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is an actor, the type who perpetually seems to be losing one gig then searching for another - not least of all as he has a certain tendency to be difficult, deciding to rewrite scripts to suit his own beliefs. He's married to Miranda (Sally Field), pretty much his antithesis as the smart-dressed business-headed interior designer. They have three kids ranging from five to thirteen, and a pretty home in San Francisco (well it must be, as it has hills and cable cars).But all is not peachy. On returning home from work early to find a veritable menagerie of farm animals and children running roughshod over her house courtesy of a Daniel-driven birthday party for their son, an argument ensues until Miranda has finally had enough, and citing the usual clichés (""we've grown apart"", ""we have nothing in common"") asks Daniel for the dreaded 'D' word. Bye bye fourteen years of marriage.The three kids absolutely dote on their father, as he does on them, so his departure (in his wood-paneled station wagon, the type of car that only people in movies seem to drive) is devastating. Daniel seeks refuge with his brother, Frank, a stereotypical gay guy (played with great gusto by Harvey Fierstein, who tends to get a lot of these roles) and his partner Jack (he's Aunt Jack to the kids, but seems to have foregone the bright blue dress and boxing glove here). It's here that we discover that the couple are movie makeup artists - hmm, now this could be a handy plot device...Custody proceedings ensue, and Daniel is given 90 days to land a secure job and set up a decent home. If he manages to do so then joint custody will be granted, if not it's the one-day a week shuffle for he and the kids. He's appointed a po-faced court liaison who he completely fails to charm, finds a dump of a flat and lands a job in television - boxing and shipping film cans. Hardly auspicious, but it's a start.As Miranda starts a 'flirtin' with an old ""acquaintance"", Stu (Pierce Brosnan), and Daniel sees the slick Englishman finagling his way into his kids' affections, he becomes increasingly desperate, and when hearing that Miranda is employing a housekeeper the old light bulb above his head tinks to life - hmm, now why can't he do it? Well, let's see. You're a forty something, remarkably craggy and hirsute man whose absence from the house is the reason for the job coming up in the first place. The odds aren't too good, but with a dowdy skirt, a generous amount of padding and a lot of help from your brother and his skills, who knows? And so Mrs Doubtfire is 'born' - a sixty-five year old nanny with an accent that veers all over the place between English and Scottish, and a face that could sink a thousand ships. Even with a head covered in prosthetics and three feet of makeup 'she' is definitely a sight.Overall: 7.5/10",Mrs. Doubtfire

209,drake blueskull,"Cute, Subtle and hilarious!",10,4 April 2002,"They love. They marry. They have kids. Then there are differences, moral or immoral,leading inevitably to a divorce. Such is the fabric of modern American society where the 'happily ever after' theme is slowly but surely giving way to the grim world of courtrooms, settlements and the fight for custody of kids. This is what Mrs. Doubtfire is NOT about. It is also not so much about people as it is about their characters. For its slightly unrealistic but ultimately noble take on a father's love for his kids, Mrs. Doubtfire is justifiably an urban fairy tale. And an american one at that.Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is a struggling artist who is yet to make it big. His mammoth ego, self-respect & a ubiquitous search for the perfect creative expression often renders him jobless. His wife Miranda(Sally Fields) is more ambitious and successful. But she's unable to deal with her frivolous and obstinate husband, and on a day that was bound to come, calls it quits & Daniel is forced to leave the house. But for all his shortcomings, Daniel simply adores his three kids and they simply cannot do without each other. Miranda soon advertises for a nanny to take care of the children. With his job out of hand & his kids away from his sight Daniel yields to desperation and decides that the only way to be with his kids is to act as a nanny and seize the job. With some Oscar winning help from his cousin Frank (Harvey Fierstein), Daniel Hillard becomes Mrs. Doubtfire, a robust English woman with a funny accent and a love for football. Mrs. Doubtfire becomes and instant hit with Miranda and the kids gradually start liking her. The kids soon discover who Mrs. Doubtfire actually is and to avoid Mama dearest's ire keep it to themselves. Soon 'her' opinion of everything, right from the choice of the T.V. show to the vehement reproach towards Stuart's (Pierce Brosnan) blooming affair with Miranda, is taken heed of. Meanwhile Daniel manages to walk right into a lucrative deal of hosting a sagging T.V. show produced by a hotshot, Jonathan Lundy (Robert Prosky). Just when everything seems to be going Daniel's way, Miranda comes to know of the truth following a hilarious restaurant act.Robin Williams is indescribably good as the father who takes on the garb of an loveable nanny almost overnight. His performance as Mrs. Doubtfire fails words and in fact overshadows the character of the real Daniel Hillard. It would be unfair to ascribe the brilliance of the character to the lards of make-up for it genuinely has a restricted role. Watch 'Big Momma's House' and you'll realise what i mean. It is how Williams performs under the unusual garb that deserves accolades. Not only does he play the role with a convincing element of feminity (that in fact is more genuine than that of the real feminine characters in the film!) but at the same time keeps reminding us that it is Daniel beneath it all and not Robin Williams. His performance hovers on the verge of perfection and he manages to draw sympathy to a father's plight. Few films (and fewer actors) have been able to exhibit such sensitivity of character in a male protagonist. And when the credits roll you know that more than Robin Williams' victory or Daniel's victory it is a father's victory that makes the movie memorable.All said and done Mrs. Doubtfire is a film that is likely to make you laugh and cry both. And if that is not true you simply have to admit that there are few actors (and fewer nannies) as good as Robin Williams.Ten on Ten",Mrs. Doubtfire

And that me commenting on one such pointless movie is nothing more than hypocrisy.But movies generally do have a point.  I definitely am the better for watching The Big Lebowski, The Great Escape or Clerks, as it gives people like me (the sort of person who wants to impose his opinions on other people) something to fill the quiet parts of my day with, to laugh about, to enjoy discussing. As Barry would ask in High Fidelity, what are your top 5 movies of all time? I bet there's not many of you reading this (thanks by the way) who have not compiled such a list in your head, or written one down, or laminated it afterwards (I jest of course), but it is an interesting topic of conversation. My top five isn't important enough to list (well it is, but I'd need to know yours as well), but it was easy to think about, which ones would I leave out? (big decisions)  My worst 5 movies of all time list was much harder, try it yourself, you'll know what I'm getting at.  I mean, even I can see good in Dirty Dancing. So we get back to Mrs Doubtfire.  Along with Alive, this movie was the first to pop into my head for my worst 5 list. How has Robin Williams been so successful in his career?  I know not.  But at least it gives me something to bitch about.",Mrs. Doubtfire
213,eric21588,Even better than I remembered.,10,20 August 2021,I've seen this movie so many times. But just watched again after several years. The movie only gets better with age.

214,rzacyhhqj,Robin Williams carried this movie,6,20 February 2021,What at times is a touching story about families after divorce is often Robin William's amazing performance covering up some inoffensive yet bland acting from the rest of the cast.,Mrs. Doubtfire

216,PopcornAndSoda,Comic Genius,8,26 July 2002,"Okay, I'm a little biast, I am a huge Robin Williams fan. None the less, I have a few things to say about this film. Robin delivers a hilarious performance that set a standard for true comedic talent. This movie proves once again what happens when you have a great script and Robin Williams together. Robin has a way of making a film his own in a way, not unlike Jim Carrey, but Robin has been around longer and has a more unique style. But Jim Carrey is great, too.",Mrs. Doubtfire
217,johnbear80,Not exactly my thing.,4,26 June 2008,"Even though this movie contains a lot of comedy gold, courtesy of Robin Williams, I have to give it several strikes. Now, bear with me, folks, because I make these observations not only as an avid movie-lover, but as someone who's survived a divorce and been through a lot of Hell after.Firstly, the very presence of Sally Field, who plays The Perpetual Victim, annoys me. She's been in pretty much every over-hyped drama ever made, whether it was 'Not Without My Daughter', or just the newest movie-of-the-week on Lifetime. She just never got over the network canning The Flying Nun, and has been weeping on screen ever since.Secondly, Robin Williams' character resorting to the deception of cross-dressing and acting out the role of an old woman just to be with his children. In any kind of an amenable divorce, a compromise short of that extreme should be made available, either by cooperation between the parents or suggestions from a third party. Perhaps a counselor of some kind.Thirdly, as a man who's been through a divorce and sees nothing of his own daughter thanks to her mother, I really resent the implication the movie makes, that the only suitable father figure for children is a woman. Men have our roles in society and life, too, and as more than just comic relief. But like so many other movies, in this one Dad's the goofball screw-up who causes all kinds of chaos, and only Mom can fix everything with just a few well-barked orders and two phone calls. Give me a break. Women are just as flawed and human as men, but the way the movies keeps presenting the gender roles is just wildly unfair.In short, I've seen better, and I wouldn't rush to see this again.",Mrs. Doubtfire
218,Roarlover34,A Family Delight,10,23 March 2010,"What an absolutely delightful film. Let's just start with the Performances. Robin Williams gives an energetic, wonderful and talented performance. He should have won an Academy Award. The rest of the cast, containing are truly brilliant with their supporting jobs. Neither one tries to outdo their role, making sure that the limelight stayed on Robin Williams. It is a film that as incredibly funny in so many ways, yet at the some time saddening. It addresses an issue that confronts many children, the issue of divorce. The film confronts this issue without making a joke of it or making the film depressing. The portrayal of a family is so superb in this film that it will live for generations to come. It is an outstanding motion picture that leaves the audience with laughs and tears, a rare combination making in one of Hollywood's finest.",Mrs. Doubtfire
219,shiloh_hubbard,Hilarious!! Robin Williams at his best!,7,19 July 2013,"I am not the biggest fan of Robin Williams, but I love these family kinds of movies that he makes! I have loved watching this movie since I was a kid. It has great comedy, and both Robin Williams and Sally Fields are excellent in their roles. ****SPOILERS AHEAD***** In San Francisco, a married couple have problems. The fun actor and comedian father (Robin Williams) has no sense of discipline when it comes to his three kids, and is not able to keep a job. His career-oriented wife (Sally Fields) is left bitter and upset since she has to continually pick up the pieces (literally) from what her childish husband does, and no longer sees anything comical about her husband's behaviors. After yet another episode of her husband's irresponsibility (in which she comes home to find a petting zoo in their yard and their house in shambles), she informs him that she wants a divorce. The movie then goes on to show the struggle that this father goes through in order to put his life in order while struggling to find and keep a job that he enjoys, while also trying to keep partial custody of his children. He finds this balance by using his acting ability, along with a disguise(with the help of his brother), to be hired by his ex-wife as the nanny of his own children under the guise of ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", an older, British woman.The hilarity continues throughout the entire movie as ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" has to deal with the jealousy of his ex-wife's new love interest (played by Pierce Brosnan) and trying to reconnect with his children as both ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and as their father, all while trying to maintain his disguise.This movie is very fun, though there is some language and scenarios that are not meant for young children. Overall, a very fun movie that is also heartwarming!",Mrs. Doubtfire
220,Red_Ice,That wasn't so bad u cynics...,8,20 June 2004,"Like i said above, sure the plot was simple, nothing legendary or earth shaking happened. The film was a good-hearted piece of work which tells, with some exaggeration, the universal theme of household strife. It also entails underlining messages mocking the American justice system (rather the workers of) as well as silly madness that is the trappings of a functional ""normal"" life. Sure there was some disturbing Freudian crap in there but overall it is all ""good fun"". There was some pretty lewd (or ""wicked"" he/she did say) little things there too. Funny that the father-who takes the most risks, makes the wisest cracks (no doubt even kind of funny at times), and certainly the most interesting- it's just rather strange that one who enjoys and knows to enjoy life so much gets branded ""insane"" or unstable. The movie, taken at a deeper level, can be seen as parody of how impossible it is to live normal life and maintain a level of creativity and liveliness. William is pretty natural in his acts, most of the supporting actors r pretty good too. If u let go of whatever grudge u have against the world and just follow along, it's not so bad. Due to the perturbing nature of some of the more embarrassing scenes, i rate the movie a well deserved 8/10.",Mrs. Doubtfire
221,henleyleong,brilliant family movie and comedy,9,11 March 2005,"probably the best family movie ever.Robin Williams played an excellent Mrs Doubtfire and Daniel Hillard, especially at the bridges restaurant. It is both sad and touching at times. Can be plenty funny when 'she' burns herself and when the kids find out.Though their father Daniel is never serious, i think there are precious few fathers in this world who love their kids more than he does. The film is set in San Francisco (an awesome place)and all the characters played their roles well.The 'little speech' Mrs Doubtfire gave at the end should be a lesson to all families. I've watched this movie dozens of times and i have never gotten tired of it.top notch family film",Mrs. Doubtfire
222,chazbert,Loved it,10,17 February 2014,"This comedy is so funny it can be watched over and over to get the same laughs each time, the scene were Mrs Doubtfire was caught urinating in the toilet like a man was hilarious and the part were someone tries to mug her in the street was so funny. I also found the part were he kept changing between himself and Mrs Doubtfire pretending it was his sister rather funny, and then the part were them two boys sore Daniel getting dressed as Mrs Doubtfire was hysterical. I got it on DVD as it was something you can watch over and over again. It is definitely a comedy movie for the whole family to experience and I recommend you all to see it as it is another one of the great comedies out there.",Mrs. Doubtfire
223,amkul-67687,One of the most classic films of all time,10,13 May 2020,So much of talaent has been used. The story is just so great. And the makeup of Robin Williams (for which they got an OSCAR) was looking actually real if I didn't know that it was a man dressed up as a woman. It's a great mix of comedy and emotions and I recommend you to watch when you are feeling down or want to have a stress-free laugh! Thumbs up for me!!,Mrs. Doubtfire
224,boaler_inc,10 out of 10,10,11 October 2016,"I love this incredible movie, but it was released when I was personally struggling with my marriage. Consequently, I have trouble viewing it today only because it brings up the emotions and feelings that I experienced during these most painful and difficult trying times of my life. We didn't make it. And after an acrimonious four year ordeal that took everything that I had worked for, for my family, it brought me to the brink of bankruptcy.Excellent movie and I still miss Robin to this day.

227,misskellyvalente,brilliantly superb on every level and character,7,24 January 2013,"This is a great film, and overlooked from the standpoint of being about a man's struggle to avoid living their rat race lifestyle that so many of them live in, while measuring up enough to get to see his kids! The acting is brilliantly superb on every level and character: Robin Williams, of course, but also Sally Fields is the character of his career oriented wife, Pierce Bronsan as the character of the career guy who wants to take her away from her family. The kids are just darling also. This film is sweet natured, charming and warm as is Williams' portrayal of the portly Mrs. Doubtfire. When I very first saw this outside of the movie theatre and on DVD, I watched it three times straight, and saw something a little different about the struggles that contemporary modern men have to go through to balance their male macho and soft sensitive sides that is part of their natures.",Mrs. Doubtfire
228,landaudan15,Hits the spot,10,19 August 2014,"This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. It really hits the spot with tremendous performances by ALL of the cast members. Mrs. Doubtfire has a real sense of reality when it comes to families that are separated by differences between the parents. It tells children that it's okay if your parents don't get along, and are separated. It's not your fault. Don't blame yourself. There are all sorts of different families out there.What really gives this movie it's unique touch is the brilliant performances of each and every cast member. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a good laugh and a heart warming family film. My suggestion, get the DVD release. RIP Robin Williams",Mrs. Doubtfire
229,RLS1153,"With all respect to Mr. Williams and his talent, I hated this movie!",1,12 September 2016,"Other reviewers have delved into the troubling aspects of the movie such as the Robin Williams' character's dysfunctional behaviors and his seemingly sudden success in TV. Both are hard to swallow, but it's a movie and movies don't have to be realistic in every detail. There is one aspect of Mrs. Doubtfire, however, that I find deeply troubling as it demonstrates an inequity that often exists in our society and that should be recognized as detrimental rather than being immortalized in film. We all recall how strict the judge was in curtailing Robin Williams' contact with his children and yet, at the end of the movie when he reunites with them and the kids wonder if it's legal, he tells them to ask their mother and she says she took care of it by talking to the judge. I wanted to throw something at the screen!! How and why could a judge's ruling have been reversed merely because a woman had a conversation with him about her ex-husband's visitation rights?? Neither parent should be in the position to wield that much sway or power with a simple wave of her (or his) hand over whether to grant, restrict, or deny the rights of their children's other parent. (By the way, I'm a father who had custody of his two kids as they grew up and who went out of his way to ensure their mother's ease of access and visitation.) I've seen too many kids and too many families damaged and victimized when one parent or the courts use access as a weapon or bargaining chip. It was happening in 1993 when this movie was made and it's still happening today over 20 years later. It needs to stop!",Mrs. Doubtfire
230,Jeremyr88,A Divorce with a Twist,10,2 December 2009,"Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) is a comical and yet heartfelt movie about a married couple who get divorced. Daniel Hilliard (Robin Williams) and Miranda Hilliard (Sally Field) get a divorce after many years of marriage and three great children. Daniel wants to stay together and work it out, to be with his kids, but Miranda disagrees. During the divorce, Daniel can only see his children once a week and that is not enough for him. Daniel decides to take matters into his own hands, with his unique characteristics as an actor in the film he disguises himself as British nanny named Mrs. Doubtfire to watch over the children while Miranda works so he can spend time with his children. Over time he spends more time with his children and helps them cope with the divorce and also betters himself along the way.I believe Mrs. Doubtfire is one of the best family films of its time and still today. It has a great story line and many emotional parts in the film that can bring families together. I have seen this film numerous times from when I was a young kid to an adult and every time it is still funny and heartwarming to me. I believe everyone should see this film and enjoy Robin Williams at his best as a British nanny.Mrs. Doubtfire was directed by Chris Columbus. I feel that Columbus does an excellent job directing the film. The unique story is portrayed as if the audience was right in film living the story. The audience can sense the emotion and closeness of the actors in the film and how great a job each scene is. I believe Columbus was trying to tell viewers that even when parents get divorced the children are always loved so much by both and will do anything to be with them. The director really portrays the feelings and emotions of families during hard times. This film is definitely one of my favorite films of all time and I love watching it with my family.",Mrs. Doubtfire

232,friedman-drew,Good Robin Williams Film,5,2 April 2012,"The opening scene is as brilliantly structured as screen writing otherwise comes. It has a middle-aged man named Daniel, whom we learn about as he quits his job as a vocal performer for a children's cartoon after he realizes his employers are immoral. This sequence provides us with a development of the character's inner personality, strong morals and consciences. The audience also leans that he is a silly, easy going person. We soon find out it is these characteristics that propel the movie into the first plot point.Daniel's wife, Miranda, wishes to divorce him because he is too goofy and immature. We are propelled quickly into the firm second act after the divorce. Before this point, we have witnessed both actions and dialogue reallocating Daniel's love and compassion for his family, especially his children. The film sets up the for following events using Robin Williams character as the plot advancer.Daniel lusts for time with his children so much, he confidentially disguises himself as a sixty year old woman then applies for a day-care job for his ex-wife--this would allow him to be around his children more often. Miranda falls for it, and the master of disguise gets his opportunity. The film then takes us through a hilarious and emotional journey into the lives of a typical American divorced family.The internal problem becomes more complex when Daniel's ex wife shows romantic interest in a new boyfriend, underplayed by Pierce Brosnan. The filmmakers could have done more with the Brosnan character. Here, he seems developed with repetition and dialogue. Although his purpose is to accommodate romantic competition, we don't know enough about him to care that much.",Mrs. Doubtfire
233,some71born,"Great, really!",10,8 October 2004,"This movie is a story for those who think that justice can never win. It can win, that's the message. As you follow the attempt of the father to win the favor of his kids and his self-centered wife, you will be shaken. The attempt on the end pays for itself and you can enjoy the victory of real-life humanity over carrier-centered woman. Robin Williams is a rare actor with a certain message in his roles; he is really sympathetic and humanity centered. There is a lot of funny things going on, so prepare to laugh. I just don't know one thing - how it can be in real life that such an average looking man like Robin Williams (just like me), can marry such a gorgeous looking lady, like in this movie! I guess there are a lot of family problems in this life. If you got some, this movie can bring you hope that they can be overcome, by God's grace.",Mrs. Doubtfire

235,odit13,Doesn't deserve it's popularity,2,6 March 2005,"Sorry, everybody, but I think its time for this movie to be debunked. There are just too many things wrong with it. Its only redeeming feature is the fact that it gave Robin Williams a chance to clown around for a while in his standard fashion, but that's it. Sally Fields once again demonstrates that she has, ever since ""The Flying Nun"", displayed all the acting skill of a piece of cardboard. She's great at giving the ""distressed kitten"" grimace, and her ability to do this is just now being surpassed by the actress who plays the preacher's wife on the Monday evening sit-com ""Seventh Heaven"".To begin with, the title of the film, and how they arrived at it, is silly.The sight gags (falsies catching on fire, etc., etc.) are amateurish, as are the accompanying lines ( "" . . . hot flashes . . . "" ).What was the point of the ""air guitar"" interlude? That was annoying and totally out of place.The costume-changing double-character back-and-forth routine in the restaurant falls completely flat. It has been used many times before, and it never has worked previously, so why did the screenwriter try to get away with it this time? Interspersing that scene with tasteless references to group sex just made it worse. Plus, they could have eliminated most of the alcohol without sacrificing content.The ending is awkward, contrived, and phony. It seems the writer just didn't know how to bring it all to a conclusion, and so he just kind of tied a few loose ends together and went home.Finally, there was in my opinion an incident of totally irresponsible content in the screenplay, that of one of the characters intentionally poisoning a rivals food with an ingredient to which the man is allergic. This should never have been included in the script. This is a personal crusade of mine. To suggest that this act is funny, and suitable material for comic effect, is reprehensible. Food allergies can be killers, and this scene was no better than cinematic inclusions of such slovenly, amoral maneuvers as cruelty to animals or child abuse. It should have been deleted from the script by the review board.",Mrs. Doubtfire

The film is also quite emotional and has a great soundtrack composed of music by Howard Shore. Sally Field and others also play a huge part in the great film that really shows how far comedy can go. Even though I heard there was to be a sequel to the movie I am glad there wasn't because I feel that it could have killed a real classic that will be remembered. I think this was truly one of Robin's most famous and greatest performances and I am so glad that it turned out to be such a success.

245,Redhotflameeyes,MRs. Doubtfire,8,11 December 2008,"The song ""Dude (look like a lady)"" will never be forgotten. This song is played in a memorable movie with stars, Robin Williams and Sally Fields, winning an Oscar along with a Golden Globe. Robin Williams plays one of his best roles as Mrs. Doubtfire, even though this movie was made in 1993 it is still a sensational hit today. Filled with comedy and still showing real life by telling the truth of how ""bad"" parents only get to see their kids when someone else is watching, and only for a limited of time, this movie was truly made before its time! Robin Williams acting as Daniel Hillard is in a testing relationship and becomes a divorced father who is at stake of only being able to see his kids for a limited time on certain days. Williams then turns in to Mrs. Doubtfire, a cross-dressing old English nanny, in an attempt to see his children and to be with them everyday. This clever plan turns in to a tremendous disaster and Daniel may never see his children again. The cameras are brilliantly used by zooming in on peoples faces at the right moment and making the audience feel as if they are in the movie. One example is when Mrs. Hillard yells it's over in one of the fights with her husband. Daniel says it can not be over because they love each other. After that point the camera zooms in slowly on Mrs. Hillard's face to show that she is not even sure that she loves her husband anymore. Although throughout the whole movie eye-level camera action was used. This makes you feel like you are actually involved in the movie and at times like that character was talking to you. Increasing the emotion that you feel for the characters. During the court room scene, going over the divorce, a rear lighting was used, which may have been indicating that Daniel is truly not that bad of a father. The music also adds to the effect that Mrs. Doubtfire is actually a man. Including the songs of ""Dude (Looks Like a Lady)"" and ""Walk like a Man"" which will make you want to get up and dance.Characters in this movie do not only consist of humans. The body suit and mask that are worn by Daniel become a person of its own, a beloved English nanny who any person would love to have help around the house. Robin Williams does a great job making the mask come to life working it from every direction possible from walking like a women to giving womanly advice. Anyone who would skip the scene of the making of the mask and going directly to when the kids are introduced to their new nanny would think that Mrs. Doubtfire is a first class, life saving nanny.This movie is definitely one you could watch over and over again and not get sick of it, so show a smile, have a few laughs and shed some tears. For Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) is one that will settle in your heart after you have only watched it once. It has just enough comedy in the right ways. As well as the serious side of showing how a divorced father holds on to the only thing in life that matters to him, which are his children. So if your ever looking for a good movie to watch, Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) is a great one to pick up! I give this movie a rating of four stars out of five meaning this movie is fantastic, but not jaw dropping.",Mrs. Doubtfire
246,dajsvega,Bad acting and bad story,1,25 December 2010,"Robin Williams continues acting in awful movies. The story is far away from funny. His acting also.The whole story is gruesomely, and can make bad influence on children, in my opinion.Maybe it is funny for newborns because the faces Mrs. Doubtfire makes..But not amusing for grownups, and children at age 3+ !The movie isn't based on funny characters and funny situations, as it should be. On the contrary, the main idea of comedy that the movie presents, are distorted faces, and too ""blown-up"" situations.

247,Remington_7,A horrible transphobic movie,1,4 June 2012,"This is one of my all time HATED movies. I watched this when I was 7 and found it okay but now re-watching it, I find it is transphobic. When Mrs. Doubtfire urinates standing up and the boy sees, he immediately runs to his sister to say call the police. This is implying cross-dressing or being a transsexual is against the law. It isn't! Implying that is discriminating amongst people that are transgendered. Many parents probably will not see this but this movie is the exact opposite of what you want your children to see. It promotes prejudice against the transgender community. They will think it is okay to be transphobic in the future. Why? Because of this movie.",Mrs. Doubtfire
248,eric-306-215116,RIP Robin Williams,10,14 March 2015,"That's was my favorite childhood movie, I really liked Robin Williams's act. He was so funny! I will miss him so much, RIP And I want to watch it again, hope it show up on Netflix some day as soon as possible! It was so shame that didn't make a movie like second part like""Mrs. Doubtfire 2""! I think ""Night at the museum 3"" movie, Robin played that movie for last time! (I'm not sure). I live in LA, sometimes I go to Hollywood, sine then I couldn't fine his star in ground! He did something wrong in her life! He shouldn't have killed himself! why would he do? nobody does not know why! Now days, I don't know why most actors and singer are trying to kill or use more drug! WHY????",Mrs. Doubtfire
249,,AWESOME,10,29 June 2004,"i have seen this movie for about the th time now and i still cannot be fulfilled. this movie has many laughter/sad scene which relates to some real life experiences, which is one of the reasons why i am attached to this movie. Robin Williams is portray's as a very affectionate father who's children are put on the line by this wife Miranda backed by various reasons. To be able to hang out with his children more often, he decides to crossdress to become an elder woman soon to become the nanny for the children while Miranda is out to work (which Miranda was seeking for). In this movie Robin William was at it best. He really showed what a golden Dad should be.... The last minutes of the movie literally put me to tears. the message in the last scene is very powerful, and convincing. The movie ending was superb as well just about everything else. The kids did a very good job of showing their unique personalities as well as be potent. The only drawback to this movie was the beginning of the movie where Robin Williams was just going overboard as well as the other actors. I just did not connect to the whole movie.",Mrs. Doubtfire
250,Falguni_sanyal,Great Family Movie,10,29 January 2013,"It was my first movie that I ever watched with my dad. First English movie I guess. I was so little then. couldn't even understood everything. but there are some movies you can watch and still enjoy it. I watched it like hundred of times now. Still it doesn't get boring at all. I will never forget the memory of it. Specially the memory of watching this movie with my dad. Also it gives the children a lesson that no matter what happens, parents stays together or not, they will always loves us. Excellent family movie to watch. People can come closer seeing the movie. Its sad that people think that it isn't worth of rate ten.",Mrs. Doubtfire
251,lahmalo,liked it,7,26 December 2004,"I have divorced parents, this movie was the first I saw where the parents didn't get back together. It really helped me cope with my parents divorce.When I was growing up, I saw so many movies like the Parent Trap, where the parents got back together and the whole family lived happily ever after. This isn't real life. Kids need to see a movie where the parents stay apart, but things do turn out OK. You can be happy even though your parents divorce. I needed this movie and it really helped me cope with a hard time. I loved Robin Williams, he was able to approach a hard topic with a light hand and make us laugh, but still keep it serious.",Mrs. Doubtfire
252,oliver-hunter,Terrible film,2,11 April 2006,"This is a dreadful film. Although the script is reasonable, and the story deals with valid, real issues, it is extremely removed from reality. Forget suspending your disbelief, you have to switch your brain off entirely! I made the mistake of going to the cinema to see this film with a girlfriend. I felt embarrassed for the great Robin Williams and just cringed at the ridiculous nature of the plot. We were both were in two minds whether to walk out of the cinema or not. In the end we stayed but it was definitely a waste of 2 hours of my life... Maybe I'm just not suited to films of this genre - I also didn't like ""Big"" or ""Vice Versa"".",Mrs. Doubtfire
253,minusthemusic-1,One Of The Funniest Movies I've Ever Seen,10,26 March 2005,"Robin Williams outdoes himself in Mrs. Doubtfire, and that's saying something considering how much I admire Robin Williams'talent.He combines his dramatic and comedic talents in other movies such as ""Good Morning Vietnam"" and ""Dead Poets Society"" and does the same in Mrs. Doubtfire.I can't help thinking that we see the real Robin Williams in this movie, as well as others that I mentioned.It's hard to imagine someone pulling off playing the character diversity needed in Mrs. Doubtfire better than Williams.Mrs. Doubtfire can't be fully appreciated unless it's seen.",Mrs. Doubtfire
254,szabo101-1,Just awful,1,29 April 2005,"Not one funny seen. Site gags that had all been performed before.Redeeming message: Kids, its not your fault when your parents get divorced? Did we really need this movie to deliver this message? The plot has conflict, but the villain is a caring, responsible, parent. The protagonist is a loving, but irresponsible adult. There is someone to hold up on a pedestal. Being simultaneously compassionate yet reckless is such a tough feat. We really need to celebrate more unstable role models so that our future generations don't feel compelled to participate in society in a productive manner that is respectful of others.",Mrs. Doubtfire
255,dgmc,England is not an island.,5,8 May 2005,"Out of curiosity, Robin Williams character has a Scottish accent (according to trivia notes) but why does he mention at the end of the movie that he is from the island of England? If England is an island, where does that put Scotland and Wales? I've noticed this a lot from the North American culture.....especially on TV. I was taught that Britain is an island consisting of three nations...England, Scotland and Wales......therefore all three nations are British not just the English. I know it sounds pedantic, but would people from the US like to be called Canadian or vice versa. Please don't get me wrong......I am not complaining, just wondering why this is so.",Mrs. Doubtfire
256,nyl-171-377587,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,27 November 2014,"Mrs. Doubtfire is a movie published in 1993 and the director is the famous ""Home Alone"" movie director, Chris Columbus. The talented actor, Robin Williams, acts as Daniel Hillard who works doing ""voices"", and who quits his job. On that day, Daniel had a party for his son which made his wife, Miranda Hillard mad. Miranda couldn't handle Daniel anymore, so they got divorced. That set off Daniel to do something, so I found him very clever and a risk-taker. One day, a house keeper, whose name is Mrs. Doubtfire, came to Miranda's house. Their children thought it's better to ask their father to look after them. Miranda thought it was nice to have Mrs. Doubtfire as their house keeper so she decided to hire her. On another day, the son accidentally saw Mrs. Doubtfire in the bathroom. This accident made the elder sister and brother know that Mrs. Doubtfire was actually their father, Daniel! But they kept the secret so that their mother wouldn't know. On Miranda's birthday, they went to a restaurant. On that day, all of the family would know that Mrs. Doubtfire was Daniel. Of course Miranda stopped having Mrs. Doubtfire as a house keeper. The children missed Mrs. Doubtfire. But not only the children, Miranda also thought it was nice when Mrs. Doubtfire was around, ""The house was so warm and cosy, the beds were always made, and the dinner was..."". As Daniel pretended to be the house keeper, Mrs. Doubtfire, s/he was able to discipline himself. That made Miranda change her mind. This movie was very touching and make us think about family. It also includes comedy so it's best to see whenever you want to laugh and be touched. All of you should watch this movie!",Mrs. Doubtfire
257,jalexander-78277,The innuendo is pretty extreme but the movie is great.,8,10 October 2016,"Overall, I felt this movie was top notch as a comedy BUT there should be more in the Parental Advisory warnings about the innuendo. There was more than one scene when Robin Williams was either talking to the mom/wife or to Stu/boyfriend and the talk turned to sex (the act primarily, and as with all things Robin Williams it went over the top and it went long). There was a scene when Mrs. Doubtfire was talking to Stu about the new piece of jewelry Stu got the ex-wife. The scene devolved into why Stu would spend that kind of money (Stu did not encourage the conversation) but Daniel (Robin) went on and on about what he thought Stu was expecting, sex, due to the generous gift. I would be ready to be embarrassed several times as you watch the movie because of the innuendo.",Mrs. Doubtfire
258,liamkcampbell,Very Depressing For A Dramedy,2,4 January 2019,"When I heard it's one of Robin Williams greatest hits, I was pretty curious to see what the comedic story of Mrs. Doubtfire be like in the film released in 1993. But after watching it, it turned out to be one of the movies I hate! It's starts a professional voice-over actor Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) who quits his job because of the mistreament. He heads home to extend one of his children's birthday party, which ended quickly when his wife Miranda Hillard (Sally Field) furiously berates him for his immaturity, and files for a divorce. When the judge announce children to be Miranda's while telling Daniel to find a fresh job in a suitable manner, he rebuilds his life as a member of a local tv station where he discovers that his Miranda is searching for a housekeeper for the kids. So he disguises himself as a old lady using his Scottish nanny voice to watch over the struggling kids without being revealing his identity. The kids where thrilled that it's his father the whole time, but during a date with Miranda's date with a boyfriend (Pierce Bronson), she was horrified after the reveal. Daniel then gets his wish granted as Mrs. Doubtfire in a television show which makes his life much better than his past.The main problem of this movie is Sally Field, not that she is a horrible actress, she is awesome! But something about this role rubs me so the wrong way and gets me absolutely angry, where I have seen that it looks like she has no heart on whatever Daniel does for. She is the one that causes a family drama and she doesn't get along with him too well and takes her kids away from him due to how bad of a parent his truly is. True, certain parents do that, and granted that she has no other option. But it's Robin Williams, he's funny, not depressing, I would rather show him some respect if I were her, but her character doesn't care, Oh she just wants what's right for her children Eeeeeee! So at the same time no! She turns out to be probably the most despicably unlikable character in the whole movie, and worst of all she does not appreciate that much humor he has given us and is more into the more reality stuff than her ex-husband's distinct character! It's really awful, generic, out of character, and mean-spirited! I can't believe what an A-hole her character is!Robin Williams is the only good element of this whole film. Pierce Bronson is alright, the rest of the movie element can blow me. It sucks, it really sucks seeing that there is more drama than comedy.",Mrs. Doubtfire
