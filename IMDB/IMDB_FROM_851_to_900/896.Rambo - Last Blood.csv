0,Leofwine_draca,Slightly rushed but powerful with it,8,3 October 2019,"LAST BLOOD is the latest, and fifth, instalment in the long-running RAMBO franchise, and a far cry from the highs of the fourth instalment (one of my favourite films of the new millennium). This is still gutsy, powerful fare, although told on a much smaller scale and with a simple revenge story. The good news is that it retains the power of the earlier films in the franchise, particularly part four. One thing that really makes this work is a gruff, taciturn Stallone, giving his darkest performance yet; this Rambo is brutal psychopath and the film wows when he's on his rampage. The early set-up scenes are involving enough, shining a light into the exploitation of women in a way rarely dealt with by cinema, while the HOME ALONE-style climax is a real highlight, perhaps playing out a little too speedily but still more than effective. A real suckerpunch of a movie that shows Stallone's still got what it takes in the action stakes.",Rambo - Last Blood
1,SnoopyStyle,Final chapter,5,18 December 2019,"In one version of this film, it opens with John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) on horseback riding up a hillside during a stormy night. It turns out that he and the police are searching for missing hikers. This is obviously a nod to First Blood and is probably the only section I like without much reservations. The rest is Rambo living with Maria Beltran and her granddaughter Gabriela on a ranch where he has dug out a series of tunnels. Gabriela is desperate to find her no-good father. Ignoring warnings from both Rambo and her grandma, she goes to Mexico anyways and gets Taken. Rambo is on a rescue mission and finds help from crusading journalist Carmen Delgado (Paz Vega).I like the rainy hillside opening. I'd rather have a loner Rambo mountain-man. Instead, he has new people and the audience have to piece it together. On top of that, the story is unnecessarily messy. There is no reason to go back and forth to Mexico. Kill the brother during the initial escape and the Mexicans will follow Rambo to the farm. There wouldn't be time to set up all the boobytraps but some of it is too Home Alone anyways. I do get the callback to Vietnam but the juice is not worth the squeeze. I also would change the initial contact with the gang. If he's not going to shoot them up, he should go unarmed and offer to buy her back. In the film, he seems to be straddling the middle with no plans. In general, the writing is problematic. It has the set pieces but they are badly put together. The gore is bloody and that's fine. Sly could have done something compelling with his aging action hero. It's called Last Blood and needs to be a big final chapter. I'm afraid that this is not anything.",Rambo - Last Blood
2,Prismark10,Rambo: Last Blood,3,10 July 2020,"Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is back. Older, he now needs to take some pills, presumably to dull the pain in the various parts of his body. Either that or he has prostrate problems.Rambo lives on a ranch with wild horses. He has a network of underground tunnels to give him flashbacks to his time in Vietnam.It looks like Rambo lives in some kind of domestic bliss with a Mexican woman Maria Beltran (Adriana Barraza) and her seventeen year-old granddaughter Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal) who refers to Rambo as Uncle John.Gabrielle will be going away to college soon. First she wants to find her father who abandoned her some years earlier as he went back to Mexico. A friend in Mexico called Gizelle has tracked the father down.Gabrielle sneaks into Mexico, finds her father who is disinterested in her and Gizelle takes her to a nightclub to drown her sorrows.Gizelle also seems to have colluded for Gabrielle to be drugged and kidnapped for sex trafficking by the Mexican cartel.When Rambo finds out that Gabrielle is missing. He goes to Mexico looking for her and quickly finds Gizelle. She points out the man who last spoke to Gabrielle.There is a journalist called Carmen who follows Rambo and comes to save him when he is beaten up by the bad guys.There is utmost stupidity when Rambo finds out the residence of the two brothers who head this cartel. Instead of any reconnaissance, strategy and planning. He just walks up to their house and gets beaten to a pulp and left badly cut. Rambo also seals Gabrielle's fate at this point.Now Rambo seeks revenge, he goes back to Mexico to get one brother and coaxes the other brother to come to America. I just knew those tunnels will come into use later on.The climax is reminiscent of Skyfall which itself borrowed from Home Alone.The action is brutal, Rambo lays booby traps and conveniently always seems to be around when they set off to make sure the baddies stay dead. I think his time would had been better spent finding a bulletproof vest to wear.This is a half baked movie with a generic plot and less of a Rambo movie. It is another film with undercurrents of racism. You would have thought Gizelle who has met Rambo previously would know this is a strange old man who must not be crossed.The last lines of the movie are so incomprehensible, I think Donald Trump tweeted them to the scriptwriter.I think it is time for Rambo hang up his crossbow. Maybe he can instead mentor Colonel Trautman's grandson in a series of spin off movies.",Rambo - Last Blood
3,claudio_carvalho,Good Screenplay,6,4 January 2020,"John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) spends his days living in a small farm in Arizona with his maid Maria Beltran (Adriana Barraza) and her seventeen year-old Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal) and using medicine to control his anger. When Gabrielle learns that her father, who left her mother and her, is living in Mexico, she decides to travel to visit him despite the advices of Rambo and Maria. She meets her friend Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda) and is disappointed with the encounter with her father. Gizelle invites Gabrielle to go with her to a night-club and she disappears. Rambo travels to Mexico looking for her and has to fight a gang of prostitution and trafficking with the support of the independent journalist Carmen Delgado (Paz Vega), who lost her sister to the traffickers.""Rambo: Last Blood"" is the last action film of the character John Rambo. Sylvester Stallone is old but the good screenplay does not disappoint the fans of the franchise. The tension increases and the bad guys are punished as expected. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Rambo: Até o Fim"" (""Rambo: Until the End"")",Rambo - Last Blood
4,nogodnomasters,You can't save everyone,4,30 September 2019,"Turns out Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) has a niece or at least someone who calls him ""Uncle John."" She gets taken by sex traffickers in Mexico and Rambo doesn't quite achieve Liam Neeson status to get her back. Except for the last 30 minutes or revenge, the film was boring. It was a lazy script.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Rambo - Last Blood
5,kosmasp,How much blood is left?,7,4 December 2019,"It wasn't so much that the general public wanted or cried for another Rambo, it was Stallone himself that wanted to have a closure with that character. And I would say he succeeds in that. So there was an extra scene in front of the movie in the European cinema version. It's another character moment but it also had an appearance by Luis Mandylor that was quite nice to see.All this aside, you can tell that Rambo has gotten old. When all kicks off (and you can tell that it'll go south, no pun intended), you are not surprised. Or you shouldn't be. You could be surprised on how John Rambo is handling a certain situation! Then again, an inciting incident has to happen, doesn't it? The answer is yes.In the end credits there is flashbacks to the previous Rambo movies, which was a nice thing to see. There is a sense of this being the last one - then again who knows? A remake or reimagening is always a possibility isn't it? This right here has a lot of violence, which might be rewarding or not for the viewer ...",Rambo - Last Blood
6,classicsoncall,"""I want them to know that death is coming...""",6,6 February 2020,"The word 'Last' in the title probably shouldn't be taken literally. If Hollywood comes calling with another payday, we might get to see ""Rambo: The Really, Really Last Blood"", but I think astute fans wouldn't mind this being the final installment. It's pretty much a diehard revenge flick all the way with not a lot of character development, and a quick demise for one of the early principal characters. In the latter going, it takes on the characteristics of a slasher film with John Rambo's (Sylvester Stallone) creative use of savage booby traps in the underground tunnels of his Arizona ranch. Not that I minded the extreme violence, but at a mere hour and a half, the film makers made it a rush job with little time to savor each of Rambo's triumphs. Even taking out the last man standing cartel member (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) was handled quickly with gruesome effect, and I couldn't really relate to the guy screaming while Rambo was hacking his chest open. I get it about making a point but the guy should have been dead on the first stab. I also couldn't relate to the after film/before credits sequence of scenes from the prior Rambo movies. All that did was emphasize how old Stallone has gotten over the past four decades, and he sure does look it in this picture. Especially in the scene where he confronts Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda) over the missing Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal). Right there he would have been right at home in a horror movie.",Rambo - Last Blood
7,jboothmillard,Rambo: Last Blood,1,6 October 2019,"First Blood was worth watching, as was First Blood Part II, while Rambo III and Rambo (4) were silly, this was the fifth entry. Thirty-seven years on from the original film, this is presumed to be the final outing for ""Sly"" and his most iconic character, alongside Rocky of course. I just knew it was going to be terrible, but I still went to see it, from Razzie nominated director Adrian Grunberg (How I Spent My Summer Vacation). Basically, eleven years after the events in Burma, Vietnam War veteran John Rambo (Razzie nominated Sylvester Stallone, also writing) lives in Bowie, Arizona in his deceased father's horse ranch. The ranch includes a series of underground tunnels, and he manages the place with his old friend, Maria Beltran (Adriana Barraza), and his niece, Gabriela (Yvette Monreal). Gabriela reveals to her uncle that her biological father Don Miguel (Rick Zingale) has been found in Mexico, by her friend Gizelle (Razzie nominated Fenessa Pineda). But Rambo knows her father, he tells her that he never bothered to have any part in her life, and that he will only hurt her. She decides to ignore his and Maria's wishes, secretly drives to Mexico to ask why Miguel had abandoned her and her mother years ago. Gizelle leads Gabriela to Miguel's apartment, where he bluntly tells her that he never really cared for Gabriela or her mother. Gabriela is heartbroken, so Gizelle takes her to a local nightclub to cheer up, unaware that Gabriela is drugged and kidnapped by enforcers of a Mexican cartel. Maria informs Rambo of Gabriela's disappearance; they realise she has travelled to Mexico. Rambo crosses the border and interrogates both Miguel and Gizelle about Gabriela's whereabouts. Gizelle leads a reluctant Rambo to the club where Gabriela was last seen and confronts El Flaco, the last person seen speaking to her. A mysterious woman, Carmen Delgado (Paz Vega), follows Rambo as El Flaco (Pascacio López) leads him to Gabriela's location, she has been kidnapped and is due to be forced into sexual slavery. Rambo is immediately confronted, beaten and marked by the cartel, led by brothers Hugo (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) and Victor Martinez (Óscar Jaenada). They take his driver's license, which includes his ranch location, and a photo of Gabriela, whom Victor recognises. The cartel vow to mistreat Gabriela further due to Rambo's actions. Carmen takes Rambo to her place where she cares for him until he fully recovers. She is an independent journalist investigating the Martinez brothers and kidnappers, hoping to find those who murdered her sister. Rambo later raids one of the brothels, killing several men until he finds a drugged Gabriela. On the way back home, Rambo talks to Gabriela, thanking her for giving him ten years of hope, before she dies from the forced overdose. Rambo is enraged, he sends Maria away to set several traps and rig explosives in the underground tunnels and around the ranch, ready for a confrontation. He then returns to Mexico to ask Carmen's help in finding Victor. She initially refuses as she knows it will not solve anything, but she changes his mind after he explains his grief and frustrations. Rambo raids Victor's home, killing several guards and decapitating Victor. In retaliation, Hugo leads a group of hitmen to storm Rambo's ranch. Each and every one of the men fall victim to the rigged traps. Hugo is the last to be left alive, Rambo mutilates him with a large knife, and rips his heart out. Following this battle, Rambo is weakened with numerous injuries, he sits on the porch of the ranch house, vowing to continue fighting and to keep the memories of his loved ones alive. It is suggested he may be dying, and a montage of clips from his past adventures (the previous films) play during the end credits, until he rides a horse of into the sunset (perhaps a metaphor for dying and going to heaven). Also starring Louis Mandylor as Sheriff. Stallone has ditched the long hair, red bandana and visible muscles, here he is simply a father-figure uncle wanting revenge against the evil wrong-doers, but it is clear he is well past his prime. This is nothing like a Rambo movie at all, no mission or guns blazing, just a very bad rip-off of a Taken movie. The only worthwhile bits are the booby traps being prepared and the villains getting punctured and blown up by them, so lots of weapons, blood and body parts towards the end, and a final highly brutal heart-stopping (literally) death. The rest of the film is absolute trash! A flimsy story of a confrontation with a drugs cartel, partially racist material, the most excruciatingly predictable and laughable dialogue you've heard a million times before (the biggest offender in my opinion), and the montage in the end credits does nothing. Easily the most forgettable and worst of the whole series, let's hope this really is the end of Rambo, an awful action. It won the Razzie for Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property, and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Screen Combo for Sylvester Stallone & His Impotent Rage, and Worst Screenplay. Poor!",Rambo - Last Blood
8,BA_Harrison,Rambo: Lotsa Blood.,8,19 September 2019,"It might not be the definition of a great movie, but Last Blood quenched my thirst for some good-old-fashioned ultra-violence. It takes a while to get there, the first hour or so devoted to giving John Rambo (Sly Stallone) something to get really riled about, but once the grizzled Vietnam vet gets his rage on, there's no stopping him until every last one of the enemy is in pieces.So what's got Rambo in such a tizzy this time? Well, his niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal), to whom he has been a father figure, is forced into prostitution by some nasty Mexican scuzzballs who keep the girl doped up on scag so that she is more compliant with the customers. Naturally, Uncle John ain't happy about this, and busts a few skulls whilst rescuing the girl, but when she dies on the way home, he goes looking for revenge. This involves hacking off the head of one of the Mexican gang leaders and dumping the severed noggin out of his car window as he drives to his ranch, where he prepares all manner of deadly booby traps in readiness for an all-out battle.The final act is what fans will have been waiting for, and it is an all out gore-fest, with Rambo chopping, slashing, shooting, dismembering and immolating for all he's worth, leaving the biggest and baddest Mexican till last, keeping good on his promise to tear out the horrible man's heart.The revenge story-line - a bit of a departure for the series- is a little formulaic to be wholly satisfying, but since I suspect most people won't be watching for an Oscar-worthy plot, it's of little consequence: Last Blood is all about delivering death in as many ways as possible, and in that it certainly succeeds.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for being so unashamedly violent.",Rambo - Last Blood
9,paul_haakonsen,"Good movie, but not a worthy finale for John Rambo...",6,24 November 2019,"I've been enjoying Sylvester Stallone movies since I was a kid, and ""Rambo"" has always been one of those special movies that just was an instant liking for me. So naturally, I would get around to watching the 2019 ""Rambo: Last Blood"" as well.So was this a fitting finale to the saga of Rambo? No, not really. Sure, the movie was good entertainment and a great action movie. However, it just didn't really have that particular element to it that the previous four movies in the franchise had. Perhaps it was because John Rambo was now fighting on home ground (which he also did in the ""First Blood"" movie, but that just had a very different feel to it) or because the entire final showdown scene seemed incredibly rushed and very anti-climatic.The storyline in the movie wasn't really as captivating as it had been in the previous movies., and yes it was definitely enjoyable and watchable. But there was just some key ingredients missing from the formula to make it truly outstanding. Now, I am not saying that ""Rambo: Last Blood"" is a bad movie, because it isn't.I must say that it is amazing to see Sylvester Stallone still going at it at his age. But sometimes it is better to just walk away from something and leave its legacy as it had been set up and built.There is a fair amount of violence in the movie, but nowhere near the mayhem that was seen in the 2008 ""Rambo"" movie, which was just out of this world in terms of pure violent scenes.As for the final showdown scene, which was definitely set up nicely and had some cool elements to it, the scene just seemed a bit rushed and it seemed way too easy for Rambo to take all of the trafficking cartel out that easily. It was enjoyable to watch, yes, but it was just too predictable.""Rambo: Last Blood"" scores six out of ten stars from me. It was definitely a good movie with an abundance of action once the movie got into gear. But just a shame that John Rambo didn't exit the stage with a more fitting way to end the franchise.",Rambo - Last Blood
10,BandSAboutMovies,It's exactly what you think it is.,7,20 September 2019,"Ever since 2008's Rambo, there have been plans of a fifth film in this franchise. At one point, John Rambo was going to lead a team of commandos against a genetically altered creature in a movie that would have been called Rambo V: The Savage Hunt.By November 2009, it was reported that the plot would be about Rambo crossing the Mexican border to rescue a girl who had been kidnapped. However, Stallone claimed that he was done with the character, stating, ""I don't think there'll be any more. I'm about 99% sure, I was going to do it... but I feel that with Rocky Balboa, that character came complete circle. He went home. But for Rambo to go on another adventure might be, I think, misinterpreted as a mercenary gesture and not necessary. I don't want that to happen.""At Cannes the very next year, Millennium Films was already advertising Rambo V and planned to make the film with or without Stallone. Luckily, that didn't happen.Say what you will about Sylvester Stallone and his films, but he's one of the few actors who has played multiple characters across multiple films. Don't believe me? We went so far as to make a list all about this fact.Now, Rambo has finally returned, with Adrian Grunberg directing. Of course, this film has already been met with critical derision in regards to its script, stereotypes and violence. Yet Stallone's career is one paved with negative ink. His audience -- take it from someone who has watched nearly fifty of his films in thirty days -- always comes back.Eleven years after the last time we saw John Rambo, he's moved on to live in his father's ranch in Bowie, Arizona (actually Bulgaria). Along with Maria Beltran and her granddaughter Gabrielle, he has a horse farm and has seemed to settle into his old age. Yet his past life constantly threatens to re-emerge -- he's taking numerous pills, he has flashbacks and he's built an elaborate series of tunnels under his home.Gabrielle wants to see the father who abandoned her and goes to Mexico to attempt to connect. It goes horribly, leading to her visiting her friend Jezel and going barhopping. Truly, only Paul Kersey has a worse life than John Rambo, as within minutes she's been roofied and enslaved by a Mexican cartel.Our hero allows his need to protect her to take over his common sense and he's quickly beaten into a near-coma by the gang, including Hugo and Victor Martinez. They take his driver's license and a photo of Gabrielle, promising that now they'll make her life a living hell -- slicing both her face and Rambo's with a bloody V.Rambo is rescued by Carmen, a freelance journalist who lost her sister to the cartel. After healing, he rescues Gabrielle just in time for her to die as they cross the border back into the United States.What follows is Rambo becoming Jason Vorhees, leading the gang into an elaborate trap ala Home Alone, but with more grand guignol than slapstick. If the ending melee in 2008's Rambo upset you with its intensity and wanton bloodshed, well...better stay home.Critics have loudly complained about the levels of blood and guts that the film displays, comparing it to a slasher film. If you've read any of the articles about the films that I truly adore, you know that this didn't upset me in the least.Of course, the xenophobic nature of Rambo as white savior in Mexico can be somewhat troubling. But honestly, I wasn't heading into a Stallone blockbuster expecting it to be woke. There are an equal amount of positive Latino characters in this film, but the sheer rage of Rambo losing the last bit of beauty in his world is what this movie is really all about.Sylvester Stallone is like a smart rock band from your teen years. He knows what works and what doesn't. He's coming to town every few months and he's only going to play the hits. All killer, no filler, as they say. He isn't going to make you listen to his artsy new single or play all night -- the film clocks in at a spartan (John Spartan!) 89 minutes (although there is also a 101 minute foreign version).Let's face it -- you're coming to the theater to watch Rambo cut a man's heart out and show it to him before he dies. This film is ready to deliver. If you're expecting anything else -- subtle nuance, political commentary or shades of grey -- you're in the wrong theater.",Rambo - Last Blood
11,Coventry,"First blood, last blood, whatever ... There WILL be Blood!",7,28 January 2020,"I can summarize and recommend ""Rambo: Last Blood"" using just one simple anecdote, in fact. How many times have you seen an action film or thriller in which a character - any character - at some point yells: ""I'm going to rip your heart out!"". Many times, right? And how often does it also actually happen? Practically never! Well, here it does. That's the kind of franchise ""Rambo"" is. It delivers. When John Rambo says that he's going to rip your heart out, he does just that.Oh boy, how I looked forward to this fifth installment! Over a course of 37 years, John Rambo became the ultimate personification of hard-boiled action, and my personal favorite Sylvester Stallone character. ""Rocky"" might be a more qualitative film series, and ""The Expendables"" might be aimed more at a popcorn-loving younger generation, but the lone and forever mentally struggling Vietnam veteran John Rambo is a personal hero. And even though this only turned out to be my third favorite film out of five (after the original ""First Blood"" and the 2008 comeback ""Rambo""), it's a fantastic thrill-ride that fully lived up to my expectations. John single-handedly goes to war against a Mexican prostitution and drug cartel when he learns they kidnapped his protégé ""niece"" Gabrielle, and subjected her to endless agony. When he can't defeat them on their own turf - and moreover loses the girl - Rambo goes good old-fashioned bonkers and lures them to his own playground ranch in Arizona. The final 15-20 minutes of ""Last Blood"" are indescribably violent, with our hero turning the tunnel network underneath his ranch into a booby-trapped war zone. Comparisons have been made between this film and the comedy classic ""Home Alone"", and it's not too difficult to see why, except - obviously - that these booby traps result in massively painful and blood-soaked deaths! Respect, Sly.",Rambo - Last Blood
12,sunwarrior13,Stallone Makes An Attempt For Modern Relevance Of Rambo,1,20 September 2019,"Sylvester Stallone stars and co-writes the screenplay for another attempt for John Rambo to make an up-to-date and modern relevance in this movie entitled,""Rambo: Last Blood"". He co-stars with Paz Vega and Yvette Monreal. It was directed by Adrian Grunberg. Does Stallone succeed in his mission for his character in this film?Before we answer the question,the movie is about John Rambo when he gets engaged in a final mission when his friend's daughter gets kidnapped. In it,he tries to rescue the daughter by crossing the US-Mexico border to bring her home and has to deal with one of the ruthless Mexican cartels.As expected,we get to witness another event of enormous goriness and action-packed violence as we once again witness Rambo goes into becoming a one-man army in this mission. As for the character, there is nothing really new in it as it except being in his geriatric age but still acts the same in all four decades. As always,he is still bothered by his psychological problems in Vietnam since the first movie of the franchise,""First Blood"" was released back in 1982.It was evident that Stallone tried an attempt for modern relevance.
Unfortunately,the viewer can see that there is no longer modern relevance for John Rambo.The war situations in the past were brought back into the story rather than that of present. The barbed wire scene where Rambo is going to pick up the daughter is a testament to that aside from the fact that he is dealing with cartels rather than foreign military. In conclusion,we can say that John Rambo have ran its course.To prove the point that the character John Rambo has ran its course,the movie have taken the plots from screenplays of movies such as ""Trackdown"" (a rancher puts the law into his hands to save his sister from sex traffickers), ""Taken"" (a father tries to save his daughter from sex traffickers), and ""Home Alone"" (Rambo surprisingly has set up traps in his house).It is embarrassing send off for this franchise.The franchise should have ended with ""Rambo"" in 2008 when it had a great character and a movie that had extreme violence.Too bad that it made the mistake of a modern update at current times by doing ""Last Blood"". In the process,it made arguably the poorest film among the film franchise.Only the devotees of the film franchise especially those who love action-packed violent movies will truly be entertained.",Rambo - Last Blood
13,searchanddestroy-1,What a deception !!!,4,9 October 2019,"I will be honest, as usual. I love none of the Rambo movies, though I went to see them as action flicks. I love only the genuine novel written by David Morell in 1972, ten years before the first Rambo. I loved the book because Rambo's character was not the real lead, not the good guy. it focused as much on him as on the sheriff Teasl; Rambo was nearly the bad guy...And both died in the end, they killed each other.

The problem is that in the five features, Rambo NEVER dies, he is indestructible. Even in this movie, though being badly wounded in the belly, he still jumps on a horse back before getting away. NOT FOR ME. I can understand that Bruce - John McLane - Willis doesn't die in a DIE HARD franchise series feature; or Clint- Harry Calahan - Eastwood makes it in his vigilantes adventures. I can understand. But here, in the supposed last Rambo movie, WHY THE HELL LET HIM LIVE?? WHY ????",Rambo - Last Blood
14,Hey_Sweden,"""I've lived in a world of death.""",7,9 July 2021,"An even longer-in-the-tooth Sylvester Stallone resurrected his long-running ""Rambo"" franchise two years ago, despite the character seeming to get a good send-off in the previous entry. And this time, the one-man-army has a more personal mission in mind: avenging the girl (Yvette Monreal) whom he's been helping to raise. Rambo has been living in seclusion, in an Arizona ranch near the Mexico border, and this unfortunate, not-too-smart girl was determined to confront the worthless father (Joaquin Cosio) who left her behind years ago. So she heads to Mexico, where she is predictably victimized by especially loathsome criminal scum who sell drugs and women.Stallone, the appealing (and sexy) Monreal, and an effective Adriana Barraza give the picture some heart, and Sly goes for a bit of introspection as Rambo reflects on the path that his life has taken. But make no mistake: ""Rambo: Last Blood"" is best enjoyed as yet another mindless, macho action flick whose major purpose is to establish a bunch of thoroughly evil bad guys and then devise many nasty ways for them to die. In fact, although it's not QUITE as over the top as ""Rambo"", ""Last Blood"" does aspire to a similar level of brutality. The finale in particular is utterly ridiculous, but irresistible for the desired visceral effect. (It takes place in a series of tunnels that Rambo has dug beneath his seemingly vast amount of land.) What's amusing is that Rambo takes a page from the Kevin McCallister / ""Home Alone"" book, and devises a bunch of lethal booby traps which the many bad guys are apparently all too happy to set off.This was supposedly intended to be the final word on this character and series; although Sly hinted that he might have further adventures if the film were successful, it did not make a particularly big dent at the box office.""Rambo: Last Blood"" kills time (and characters) agreeably enough if one is in the mood for a good slaughter. What was best about the end credits was seeing archive footage from all the previous entries.Also available in an extended cut, with an opening sequence showing Rambo coming to the aid of people during a storm.Seven out of 10.",Rambo - Last Blood

The film itself is a very slow burn, though the last 20 minutes or so do bring back a bit of the gung-ho flair of their predecessors. It is short and sweet.",Rambo - Last Blood
17,zardoz-13,Good to the Last Drop of Blood,8,28 September 2019,"Movies about brawny heroes rescuing damsels-in-distress from despicable dastards won't be the same after the fifth entry in the ""Rambo"" franchise starring Sylvester Stallone. Director Adrian Grunberg's ""Rambo: Last Blood"" sets a higher standard for basic revenge-themed thrillers. Indeed, aside from some startling plot twists which shatter conventions and catch you off-guard, virtually everything in the new ""Rambo"" movie is painfully predictable. When our hero came home from Burma to the family ranch in Bowie, Arizona, at the end of ""Rambo"" (2008), he might have felt that he had left the worst part of his pugnacious life behind. No, fat chance of that! John Rambo plunges into a maelstrom of violence when the naïve daughter of a relative enters Mexico against his advice to confront the biological father who abandoned her mother and her without explanation. Of course, it was inevitable Rambo would eventually tangle with a merciless Mexican cartel. Clocking it at a snappy 89 minutes, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" swamps us with neither superfluous characters nor complicated flashbacks. Grunberg and ""Paid in Full"" scenarist Matthew Cirulnick, ""Wyatt Earp"" writer Dan Gordon, and Sylvester Stallone keep everything short, straightforward, but extremely savage. Everything that can go wrong for our virile hero goes wrong with harrowing as well as heartbreaking consequences. If you relish raw, realistic action movies with pitiless, unrepentant villains, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" will slice and dice and then deep fry you when all Hell breaks loose during its third quarter. Bad guys bite bullets, spikes, grenades, knives, and explosives by the dozens. The manner of death that they suffer isn't pretty and looks excruciating. The contemporary settings where the violence erupts in this ""Rambo"" epic accentuate the horror, particularly our hero's warren of tunnels. Whereas ""Rambo"" (2008) qualified as a military ""A-Team"" style exercise in combat maneuvers, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" resembles an old-school, Charles Bronson revenge opus with our hero playing a lone hand against hopelessly overwhelming odds.Considering the outcome of ""Rambo: Last Blood,"" you might classify it as more of a horror chiller than a traditional damsel-in-distress actioneer, with a double-digit body count. Unlike previous ""Rambo"" movies, nobody must either scour the remote corners of the globe to find our protagonist or struggle to recruit him for a singular mission. John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone of ""Rocky"") thrusts himself voluntarily into the line of fire. When we see Rambo for the first time, he is decked out in western wear like The Marlboro Man, and he is breaking horses in a corral. After the death of his father, Rambo took over the daily operations of his ranch. Rambo's niece, 18-year old Gabriella (Yvette Monreal of ""Lowriders""), and their matronly housekeeper, Maria (Adriana Barraza of ""Wild Horses""), live with him on the premises. One day, Gabriella announces that she wants to meet the father she grew up without and learn what prompted him forsake his family. Rambo and Maria warn her in the grave terms to wait until she has graduated from college. Predictably, Gabriella has little patience for waiting. Cruising off below the border, she renews her friendship with the dubious Jezel (Fenessa Pineda of ""You, Me and Dupree"") who claims to know her father's whereabouts. Naturally, everything Rambo and Maria warned Gabriella might happen happens with the worst costs. A cartel henchman spikes her drink with Roofies at a murky night club, and she awakens to find herself abducted with dozens of other unfortunate girls and forced into a prostitution ring. When Rambo discovers her disappearance, he loads up his automatic pistol, sheathes his knife, and enters Mexico.Rambo underestimates the cartel, and the slimy villain, Hugo Martínez (Sergio Peris-Mencheta of ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"") treats him with ironic contempt. He lets his army of henchmen stomp Rambo into bloody submission in a rooftop scene that exposes their sadism. Afterward, Hugo promises Rambo that he turn his virginal niece over to his gang so they can satisfy their lusts with her. Furthermore, he allows our hero to live and take the memory of what Hugo does to his niece with him to the grave. Hugo's brother Victor (Óscar Jaenada of ""Hands of Stone"") brandishes a knife and slashes Rambo's face. Later, they slash Gabriella's face. Watching Rambo take a pounding from nearby is an independent journalist, Carmen Delgado (Paz Vega of ""Spanglish""), who helps him escape once his assailants have left him. Rambo spends four days recovering from the beating, and then beheads Victor with his knife and leaves him for Hugo to find. No sooner has this happened than Hugo mobilizes an army and they careen across the border for Rambo's ranch. Meantime, Rambo's a reception for them that is reminiscent of the booby-traps that Clay Banning (Nick Nolte) planted around his cabin in ""Angel Has Fallen."" The finale ripples with explosions galore, and our hero draws the army of machine gun toting thugs into his maze of gloomy tunnels. ""Rambo: Last Blood"" earns its gory R-rating as our vengeful hero blows up bad guys and riddles their remains with lead.Generally, movies featuring cartel villains tend to be violent. If you've seen ""Sicario,"" ""Sabotage,"" ""Savages,"" ""End of Watch,"" and ""Desperado,"" you know cartel dastards kill without a qualm and care for nothing but their own greed. Rambo does what any shrewd combatant would, he chooses his own battlefield. He lures this convoy of armed and dangerous dastards to his ranch and provides payback of their crimes. It would have been a cop-out to make another battle film. Meanwhile, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" sets a new standard for revenge movies and makes the Liam Neeson ""Taken"" trilogy look like paddy cakes. Sure, it unfolds slowly at first, but the filmmakers are crafting the narrative, and slipping in some brutal surprises, but it's a well-done, concise, slam-bang saga. I rank the third ""Rambo 3"" as the best, with ""Rambo 4"" coming in second, and the ""Rambo 2."" Nevertheless, despite its shortcomings, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" is still good to the last drop.",Rambo - Last Blood

This helped bring out the humanity that we knew was in him, but had been buried pretty deeply for the 3 to 4 decades before.

Anyone who says that it's not a problem, I'm not calling you a bad person, I'm just asking you to please, really consider what we progressives are saying on this. And don't insult everyone's intelligence by pretending that this is only something that people on the left are reading into the movie. Regardless of the exact goal of doing so, this film was very carefully crafted to put Donald Trump's infamous claims that Mexicans are nearly all drug dealers and rapists up on the silver screen. At a time when immigrants are put in detention centres, denied soap and toothpaste, with families being separated, the depiction of Latinos in this is ugly and deeply irresponsible. There already is a lot of violence against this powerless group of people in the US, and this might worsen that. The frustrating thing is that this iconic hero doesn't have to represent the worst American right-wing. They could easily have gone in the other direction: have the villains be terrorists, and Sly defending innocent Hispanics against them. After all, the other sequels have had him fighting for those who need a champion.I recommend this to those that it will appeal to. 7/10",Rambo - Last Blood

23,Wizard-8,Unsatisfying final (?) entry in the series,3,28 December 2019,"Reports you may have heard about this fifth entry in the ""Rambo"" series being the weakest of the five films are unfortunately true. While the movie doesn't look as cheap as what Rambo creator David Morrell claimed it to be, I could understand his other objections about the movie. The movie doesn't really feel like a ""Rambo"" movie; the pacing is slower, and there is also a lot less action than you might think. The characters are really weak; Stallone's character seems more like some aimless former soldier than how Rambo was in the previous four movies, the journalist character hardly has anything to do, and the bad guys are really underdeveloped. As mentioned before, there is less action than you might think, with the first hour of the running time only having a couple of minutes of action at the most. The movie tries to compensate for this by attempting to have a really intense and bloody climax, but I only found all this mayhem in this part of the movie to be average at best, and certainly not worth the wait. After the killing stops, the movie is capped by a ""that's it?"" ending that suggests a sixth entry in the series is possible... but boy, after watching this movie, I sure hope Stallone puts Rambo to rest.",Rambo - Last Blood

Stallone does a fine job portraying him as both a kind man to his friends, though a merciless killer to his enemies. Direction by Adrian Grunberg is efficient, even if the story holds few surprises. Loads of action at the ultra-violent climax, which features various ingenious booby traps to kill the bad guys.

But people seem to forget that movie was just a depressed remake of 'Commando' which, ironically was a chance for Schwarzeneggar to try and usurp Stallone when 'Rambo: First Blood Part II' was released.So it's irony all around, Stallone is metaphorically remaking a film that tried to usurp his status.But is it any good?Oh my gosh, this was a pleasure from beginning to end. Yes, it's political correctness is unethical, but the most successful film in the franchise 'Part II' was just pure propaganda for the Reagan era, and that film was basically saying, we really won the war, so knock off that PTSD soldier, you are a hero.Rambo has a ranch, a pseudo niece who gets kidnapped, so he does what any person would do, and gets pummelled. And what would Rambo do when that happens? We all know that.It's a slow burner for sure, but the final third is an orgasm for any action fan, and yes, it's brutal, but this is personal to Rambo, and the rationale is there for his acts.Stallone is pretty wonderful as Rambo, yes, the bad guys are straight from the Cannon studios bargain bin of bad guys, but anyone paying for a ticket for a Rambo film will know what to expect.I personally loved it, it's a perfect finish to a very ho-hum franchise.Stallone has been phoning it in for a while, but when he cares, he gives the audience what they want, pure joy.",Rambo - Last Blood

33,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Don't push it.,5,19 September 2019,"'Rambo: Last Blood (2019)' is, essentially, every old-man action movie rolled into one. I mean, it's basically just 'Taken (2008)' for a long portion of its run-time. It's simple, revenge-based stuff and it's about as far from 'First Blood (1982)' as... well, just about any of the other 'Rambo' films, I suppose. It tries its hardest to impart some emotion to its otherwise rough-and-tumble ramble. In places, it actually succeeds, genuinely subverting expectation and ticking all the right boxes for audience investment. It's clear that Stallone isn't so ego-obsessed as to never be seen in pain on-screen. The flick never really tugs at the heart, though, and seems more focused on its grisly violence than its interpersonal relationships. Due to a strange pacing, the action-packed finale arrives before you know it. As the trailers have shown, this final third takes a turn for the 'Home Alone (1990)' - although, I feel like it's actually supposed to be homaging the first flick's forest traps. Here, a seemingly endless stream of Mexican baddies (because, yes, the piece plays into the tired and unhelpful stereotype of ""Mexico bad"") funnel into Rambo's tunnels only to be dispatched in as many gruesome ways as director Grunberg can think of. This segment ought to be the most exciting, but it's just rather repetitive. I suppose it's supposed to be cathartic, too, but it just comes across as rather sadistic. Besides, the main villains just aren't compelling enough to be worth the effort, despite being more than despicable enough for the plot's purposes. It's also worth noting that some of the gore is just straight-up silly, which accidentally betrays the otherwise serious tone. Generally, the picture is entertaining enough to never be boring. It's not much more than that, though. It plays into pretty much every old, sometimes even retired, stereotype associated with the genre (see the aforementioned 'Mexico' thing as well as the fact that pretty much all the women are victims, save a baddie and a barely-there grandmother). It's also just really grim, bleakly descending into near nihilism before it ends with a bizarrely upbeat, jingoistic tune. It's not bad, but it's not great. 5/10",Rambo - Last Blood

35,Cineanalyst,Bloodlust,5,11 January 2020,"The Rambo series may've begun in ""First Blood"" (1982) as a poignant examination of a Vietnam veteran's trauma and struggles to reintegrate into society, but, now, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" is simply exploitation fare. That'll be enough for fans of gory machismo fantasies, though, and, admittedly, it's intoxicating and even rather amusing in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way. After all, the entire production is in bad taste, but I can embrace that ethic to an extent. The narrative begins as ""Rambo"" meets ""Taken"" (2008), where the titular hero employs his ""very particular set of skills"" in the service of rescuing his adopted daughter. From there, it becomes a rape-revenge plot in the vein of the ""Death Wish"" series, concluding with a ridiculously-violent variation on ""Home Alone"" (1990).Accompanying that generic formula, there's the conspicuous alignment with right-wing politics in the United States during the Trump administration regarding Mexico and immigration. Mexico's side of the border is depicted as a gang-infested city trafficking in sex slavery, whereas Rambo inhabits idyllic rural virtues to the north. Ultimately, he lures the baddies into a wall of bullets, mutilation and torture of his own design. This is a character--a walking, talking bloodbath--who has already and largely single-handedly won wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Myanmar, so securing the border seems par for the course.Additionally, that the direction and script here otherwise are slipshod is almost irrelevant. The daughter, introduced for the plot here, is nothing more than a cliché, for which it would be a challenge to be concerned about her fate if that were the point of this enterprise, as opposed to the real point of seeing 73-year-old Sylvester Stallone going on a bloody rampage. I understand that the tunnel business is supposed to recall Rambo's Vietnam past, but that, too, hardly matters except to help make the hero believably unhinged (which, it must be said, mission accomplished). The zoom focus shots and montages are prosaic, as well, but refined filmmaking would've been lost on this Rambo burger. What ""Last Blood"" does well badly it does excessively, but also within a thankfully-brisk runtime. On its own terms, the picture is a success.",Rambo - Last Blood

Okay, I should be honest and say that the middle three were just excuses for actions and lots of explosions, but this one, well, it does actually go back to the style of the original, where the ending is inconclusive, and the film itself can be pretty hard to watch at times.Anyway, we start off with Rambo apparently finally getting some peace. He has returned to the United States, and is now living on his father's farm with the closest thing that he has to a family. Yet we also know that even though many years have passed since the war, it is still with him. This is good because now that Rambo is much, much older, we once again learn that the warrior never truly leaves the man.This is an interesting idea because the Vietnam Vet films have now gone to the wayside. In a way we saw many young soldiers come back and struggle to reintegrate into society, but now we have Rambo, an old man, and we still see that he simply cannot readjust. It is almost as if it is suggesting that what happened to him will stay with him forever. Mind you, considering that he never really left the army, if the three previous films are anything to go by, then there is that.Anyway, his niece decides that she wants to go to Mexico to find her father, and that turned out to be a pretty bad move because she ends up getting abducted and used as a sex slave. Needless to say that this doesn't end all that well. Okay, I can't really speak all that much of Mexico, but once again we are seeing it through the eyes of Hollywood, which tends to play up the fact that the place is pretty dangerous (and that does have a lot to do with the fact that a nice, peaceful, country is pretty boring, but then again look what happened to the young lady who traveled to France in Taken).Well, let's just say that bad things happen, and when bad things happen to Rambo, well, he just doesn't let them rest. Then again, we are probably all in that category, expect for the fact that Rambo is a trained special forces soldier, and is able to set an elaborate booby trap for the cartel, and lure them back to his farm. Of course, not truly understanding how things operate in Mexico does lead him into trouble (though I would ask why, namely because he has lived for an extended period of time in South East Asia, and I suspect that gangs all act the same around the world, expect that for the last few years he has been in isolation on his farm).Still, it is a pretty good movie, better than the previous three, though of course it is never going to supersede the original movie, but then again I do ask whether that is possible. The other interesting thing that I've noticed in the film is how they demonstrate how useless that wall that a certain person has insisted on building actually is, considering that all they need to do is just tunnel under it (and there has been a lot said in other films about the fact that the cartels simply have tunnels going under to wall to enable them to enter the United States).",Rambo - Last Blood

42,slightlymad22,Does Not Feel Like A Rambo,6,29 December 2019,"It was great to see Balboa Productions at the start. It moves at a very quick pace, but it is almost too quick. We do not have time to get to know and care about Gabrielle/The housekeeper, and to a lesser extent Carmen. We don't have time to get to know and hate the bad guys, they are just one dimensional, cliche bad guys. I prefer it when a movie makes me hate a bad guy!!For me, it is nothing like Unforgiven, except the narrative similarities, but that is it. It is more a Taken movie than Unforgiven/Logan type. Which may please some people, as I know a lot of people did not care for Logan.All the acting is decent from all concerned, especially Yvette Monreal, she does a great job, especially in the scene where she is first explaining to Ramho about wanting to go see her father in Mexico. Bulgaria (a location I am never a fan of as a filming location) does a great job of standing in for Mexico. Sly does his best acting (since the first Creed) when he is delivering a monologue at about the hour mark.There is not much action until the end, I expect there to be a lot of Home Alone comparisons after the final act, which is amazingly brutal. Fans of the violence in the franchise will not be disappointed. Sly didn't seem like Rambo up until this point. He is popping a lot of pills!! The way he stealthily takes out his enemy one by one is reminiscent of the woods in First Blood. Make no mistake, this is Rambo. Easily the best part of the movie",Rambo - Last Blood

45,cruise01,"Gritty, Brutal, and an old school action film that delivers.",8,20 September 2019,"Rambo: Last Blood (4 out of 5 stars).Rambo: Last Blood is a gritty, bloody, and another revenge predictable story which has John Rambo facing against bad guys who are sex trafficking in Mexico. Being the fifth Rambo film in the series, you can not expect anything more but a simple thin plot that just gives Sylvester Stallone to come up with creative traps and gritty ways to kill the bad guys. Which is just what you can expect in this fifth film. Simple and predictable story. But the action sequences are great, gritty, and exciting.The plot follows Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) living the quiet life in a ranch. He lives next to his niece and his old friend Maria. When his niece Gabrielle wants to go to Mexico to find her dead beat father that walked out of her and her mother's life. She gets kidnapped and sex trafficked by a group of bad guys. Rambo heads down there to rescue her which gets the attention of the bad guys to come back to his home. Which he has set a trap for them.The plot is thin and predictable. Rambo lectures Gabrielle about the dangers of the real world that she has yet to experience. Fresh out of high school. Her ignorance has her leaving the ranch anyways to see her father. She makes the stupid decision to see her shady friend in Mexico. After being upset about seeing her father. Her friend convinces her to go to a club. Which you can tell what is about to happen next.If you could put aside the weak story. The revenge concept builds the suspense and thrills seeing Rambo going in a territory were he is alone and defenseless when he is surrounded by a gang of guys. The film works great with its brutal fight scenes and action. Which is definitely what you can expect in a Rambo film. Rambo using nearly every weapon from hammers, knifes, arrows, and guns. There are some cringing moments when he digs his finger inside a guys knife wound to pull a bone out. It is what you can expect. A mindless brutal action flick which does its purpose to entertain.Sylvester Stallone does great playing the veteran soldier of Rambo. Even though, the story has been weak in those films. The action is always worth the price of admission. I will love to see another sixth film with Stallone playing the character. The villain is underdeveloped in the film but just like every bad guy in every movie. You don't really need to know anything more besides they will face against Rambo's wrath.Overall, Rambo: Last Blood is a good action thriller. The plot is predictable and weak just like another revenge thriller type. Sylvester Stallone does great at what he does. The action sequences are brutal, gritty, and intense. The showdown at his ranch is very exciting to see him take down a gang of bad guys.",Rambo - Last Blood
46,zkonedog,"Can't Pull Off The ""Creed"" Magic (Or Even Come Close)",3,24 September 2019,"During a two-year stretch in the late-2000s, Sylvester Stallone resuscitated his Rocky and Rambo characters to largely successful reviews. Upon the conclusion of ""Rocky Balboa"" (2006) and ""Rambo"" (2009), it was assumed those characters would not be seen or heard from again. But then a little project called ""Creed"" brought Stallone back to Rocky, and ended up propelling that character all the way back to an Oscar nomination. Likely buoyed by the success of such a character rejuvenation with Rocky, Stallone tries to do the same with John Rambo here in ""Rambo: Last Blood"". Unfortunately, the magic cannot be captured in the same way (or sadly even come close)For a basic plot overview, ""Last Blood"" sees Rambo (Stallone) living on his family's ranch in Arizona, where he has become a sort of surrogate father to niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal). When Yvette goes to Mexico to find her birth father and gets caught up in the sex-trafficking trade, however, Rambo decides to put everything on the line to save her and bring her captors to his own sort of ruthless justice.Perhaps the most accurate description or comparison I can give of ""Last Blood"" is ""Home Alone meets Taken"", and that's not what one wants to hear in relation to a Rambo film. In the simplest possible terms, what happened here is that the poignant messages from the original 1982 ""First Blood"" that started the franchise are absolutely nowhere to be found. No, this Rambo is much more a descendent of the ""killing machine"" that he depicted in the second and third films. This is a sad development, as ""machine gun Rambo"" is essentially a cardboard cutout of a character, while ""Army jacket Rambo"" is filled with nuance and meaning. Here, there is no whiff of the latter and instead built around the former.Even as a gruesome death-fest, however, ""Last Blood"" comes off as little more than a B-movie for much of the proceedings. It feels rushed and without the usual polish that Stallone is able to give to his prestige character projects. Basically, the entire plot is nothing more than a massive mechanism for setting up the final sequence, which itself descends into violence that seems more ""comic"" than ""visceral"".Not helping matters at all is that Stallone is the only one (and I mean literally the ONLY ONE) giving even a decent acting performance here. He gamely tries to inject some gravitas into the John Rambo character one last time, but the script is so poor and the auxiliary cast so lackluster that it more just made me feel a bit sorry for his once-great character.Overall for me, when it comes to the Rambo franchise I will always have the most respect for First Blood (one of my favorite single films of all-time, any genre) and Rambo IV, as they are the ones that truly capture the essence of Rambo's tortured soul in relation to his Vietnam War past. Last Blood? It is building off the blood-and-guts and ""action hero Rambo"" of parts 2 and 3, which have never really been all that well-received to begin with. That is the main downfall of this project, and what ultimately sinks it to pretty low depths.",Rambo - Last Blood
47,eddie_baggins,Rambo the rancher should've stayed retired,2,17 December 2019,"To put it plainly, there's no reason for Rambo: Last Blood to exist.Adding nothing to the cannon of the story of war veteran turned one man army John Rambo, Last Blood is the type of heartless and pointless exercise that only the most die-hard and desperate franchise fans will enjoy, as the rest of us witness the now 73 year old Sylvester Stallone disappointingly rehash one of his most beloved creations for a story that barely passes the muster as an excuse for a ranch-owning Rambo to spill some more claret.It's not like Stallone hasn't had success with bringing back past glories, Creed of course is one of his crowning achievements but Last Blood feels like a step too far as Stallone and director for hire Adrian Grunberg take us on a nasty, grim and charisma free affair that see's 60 - 70 minutes of screen time wasted on a Taken-lite Mexico adventure that very quickly turns into a gore-porn of epic proportions as Rambo takes it to a bunch of paper thin cartel bosses to enact revenge on them for crimes against his acquaintances.The worst thing about Last Blood is somewhere in this concept is a potentially strong story about PTSD, family and finding one's place in the world, nothing original but certainly something more meaningful but with its sledgehammer approach to butchering any nuances or finer details of its narrative drive, Last Blood is like a bad 80's direct to video like action thriller that fails to justify any reason to have been made.One thing Last Blood does do is remind us just how strong Rambo started out his life in First Blood in 1982.A film that stands the test of time thanks to it actually creating a worthy story, a likable lead and some memorable set-ups, First Blood was a strong adaptation of David Morrell's character and the perfect fit for Stallone's particular style of acting but as was the case with the increasingly dwindling returns of later installments, Last Blood loses sight of what made its central character so appealing in the first place, to become nothing more than a mindless exercise in over the top set-pieces that mean very little once the credits begin to roll and you move quickly onto the next thing available to your viewing needs.Despite hearts being ripped out of chests, shotgun bullets being turned into flammable cartridges and Stallone mumbling his way around some deep musings on growing old and past trauma's, Last Blood gives us nothing to remember other than an end credits montage that reminds us all of how far down the drain John Rambo has sunken in the past 30 plus years.Final Say -Slowly moving forward towards its insanely violent crescendo that offers zero surprises or benefits, Rambo: Last Blood is not the fitting farewell to a beloved cinematic creation that we would've liked, rather a desperately out of place offering that should never have been given the green-light in the first place.1 underground tunnel out of 5",Rambo - Last Blood
48,leonblackwood,A poor ending to the franchise! 3/10,3,3 February 2020,"Review:
I'm glad to hear that Sylvester Stallone (John Rambo), has finally put this franchise to bed because the franchise was drastically going downhill. Personally, I love First Blood but the rest of the films became a joke after a while. This movie doesn't even feel like it should be in the franchise because Rambo is really old and slow, and there is way too much dialogue, compared to the other movies. On top of that, the overdramatic music, terrible action scenes, and stiff acting proved that they should have left this franchise alone after the 3rd movie. There are some emotional scenes, which brought through the intensity element, but I'm not used to seeing Rambo getting his butt kicked. I know that it is set later on in his life and that he is battling with his demons, whilst trying to live humbly with new-found family, but that's why it didn't really seem like a Rambo film. It seemed more like a cheap TV movie, which won't be remembered, so they really should have put it to bed years ago. Anyway, the movie is set eleven years after the events in Burma, where Vietnam War veteran John Rambo lives in Bowie, Arizona in his deceased father's ranch, which he manages with his old friend, Maria Beltran (Adriana Berraza) and her granddaughter, Gabriella (Yvette Monreal). Gabriella reveals to Rambo that a friend of hers, Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda) has found Gabriella's biological father, Miguel, in Mexico. Against Rambo and Maria's wishes, Gabriella secretly drives to Mexico to ask why Miguel had abandoned her years ago. Gizelle leads Gabriella to Miguel's apartment, where he reveals that he never really cared for her, or her mother. Gizelle takes a heartbroken Gabriella to a local club, where Gabriella is drugged and kidnapped by enforcers of a Mexican cartel. Meanwhile, Maria informs Rambo of Gabriella's disappearance in Mexico. Rambo travels to Mexico and interrogates both Miguel and Gizelle about Gabriella's whereabouts. Gizelle reluctantly leads Rambo to the club where Gabriella was last seen and confronts El Flaco, the man who last spoke with Gabriella. A mysterious woman, Carmen Delgado (Paz Vega) tails Rambo as El Flaco leads him to Gabriella's location. Rambo is immediately confronted, beaten, and marked by the cartel, led by brothers Hugo (Sergio Peris-Mancheta) and Victor Martinez (Oscar Jaenada). They take his driver's license, revealing the ranch's location, and a photo of Gabriella, whom Victor recognises. The cartel vow to mistreat Gabriella further due to Rambo's actions. Carmen takes Rambo back to her home where she cares for him until he fully recovers. While Rambo is being cared for by Carmen, Gabriella is stripped and consistently dosed with heroin and sold to be raped repeatedly. Carmen reveals herself to be an independent journalist who has been investigating the Martinez brothers, the kidnappers and murderers of her sister. Rambo later raids one of the brothels, killing several men until he finds a drugged Gabriella. On the way back home, Rambo thanks Gabriella for giving him hope for ten years before she dies from the forced overdose. Enraged, Rambo sends Maria away and rigs the ranch with traps for a confrontation, and later returns to Mexico to ask Carmen's help in finding Victor. Carmen initially refuses, believing that it will solve nothing, but is convinced after Rambo appeals to her grief and frustrations. Rambo raids Victor's home, killing several guards and decapitating Victor. In retaliation, Hugo leads a group of hitmen to Rambo's ranch, where each falls victim to the rigged traps. Will Rambo get vengeance for Gabriella, and kill the evil Hugo? You have to watch the film to find out! As soon as the film started, I knew who was going to live and die, and I knew that Gabriella was going to cause trouble for Rambo. Personally, I can't remember the last decent Sylvester Stallone movie I've seen, so my expectations weren't that high, and it was sad to see Rambo go out like that. Although I grew up with his movies, I can't see a place for Sylvester Stallone movies anymore, which is sad because the Rocky movies, up the 4th, and First Blood are all-time classics. Maybe it's time to call it a day! Anyway, I was really disappointed with this film, and I think that you will find it cheap at your local petrol station soon. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Adrian Grunberg, who also brought you How I Spent My Summer Vacation starring Mel Gibson. I'm surprised that he was chosen to direct the final Rambo because he lacks experience behind the camera. He didn't bring anything new to the project, but I liked the little montage at the end, which went through all of the Rambo movies. You get to see how much Sylvester Stallone has changed over the years, and it did make me want to watch First Blood again, but I won't be giving this movie a second watch.Budget: $50million

Trying to hold on to that former glory is like trying to grasp at air. There is nothing left and while it is understood you have bills to pay, this script sucked.There is no logic to the story.

52,SAMTHEBESTEST,RAMBO LAST BLOOD IS BRUTALLY VOILENT BUT A SIMPLE REVENGE DRAMA..,5,20 September 2019,"RAMBO LAST BLOOD REVIEW :
Rambo is one of Hollywood's Popular franchise as well as Sylvester Stallone's Most Popular series. Sylvester as Rambo was trend setter in 80s and the first 3 films released in the same decade did so well critically and commercially. Now the Fifith film of the franchise ""Rambo Last Blood"" is releasing after 11 years gap since ""Rambo"" (2008). We all miss that Young, dashing and Muscleous Rambo but gotto accept his age and physical changes though. Rambo Last Blood as fifth Film doesn't help anything in the Franchise but just adds another Watchable Action Entertainer.The film opens with the scene where John Rambo fails to save a few people from a flash flood amid a storm. After the opening scene, 11 years after returning to the United States from Thailand, John Rambo now lives in Bowie, Arizona and works on his long-estranged family's ranch with his niece Gabrielle. Though his life is free from the violence that long defined it, Rambo still suffers from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, which Gabrielle helps him cope with. A nursing student with a promising future, Gabrielle insists on visiting Mexico to visit her estranged father despite Rambo's wishes not, out of knowing Mexico is crime-filled. Deciding to refuse hearing his words, Gabrielle leaves to Mexico. Now what happens to Gabrielle and how Rambo takes Revenge continues the storyline and you have to watch film to find his revenge.With the runtime of around 88 minutes, Rambo Last Blood is quick ending film but that makes it a limited space action film. Action scenes are Brutally Violent and that's why Enjoyable. Cinematography is decent and so does the Screenplay. Even though there are no Loo breaks, there are no USP factors as well. Sylvester Stallone as Rambo is Good, Yvette Monreal as Gabrielle looks Cute and Beautiful. Sergio Peris shines in Negative role whereas Adriana Brarraza as Maria and Paz Vega as Carmen are fine.Overall imact of the film doesn't really suit Rambo's Image which we love to see, hence film ends on an Average Note. Being an simple Revenge Drama, Last Blood is surely one time watchable but the standard of Rambo Franchise deserves a bettter film with something really inspiring and recommendable. This one is watchable only and only for Sylvester Stallone's Action Avatar and if you really enjoy watching it then go for it.RATING- 5/10*",Rambo - Last Blood

54,imseeg,"I expected a cheap sequel, but I got a blistering, bleak, true to life ripping action drama. One of Stallone's best acting performances. NOT suited though for old Rambo fans.",8,13 February 2020,"I never expected such a serious, bleak, hard hitting action DRAMA. I would not recommend it though to the older Rambo fans, because 75% of the movie is serious DRAMA about human trafficking of girls in Mexico. Not action, but serious DRAMA is what the start of this movie is about. I guess lots of (Rambo) action fans wont like that. I did like it though, because the drama was seriously real and touching.The story: Rambo's niece gets kidnapped in Mexico and is forced into prostitution. Rambo is gonna save her. Will he succeed? May sound like a cheap B-movie story, but hold your horses, the execution of this story is TRUE TO LIFE (up to a point..., because there is still enough blistering straight over the top violence)The good: serious acting performances by all actors involved. This is (fortunately) NOT SOLELY a dumb witted action movie, but it has a true to life dramatic story at it's heart AS WELL. Impressive. Stallone CAN act! I knew that already, but this movie shows it AGAIN.The bad: it's a bit low in suspense at the beginning. Minor complaint though, because there is more HIDEOUS violence, compared to former Rambo editions. The violence is really gruesome at moments. Not sure if I liked that, but it was impressive nonetheless, sort of...Sylvester Stallone is still the man! He looked tough, but he simultaneously succeeded in making a great (last) true to life, ORIGINAL and DRAMATIC sequel!

56,paul-allaer,Tired franchise has run out of ideas,3,28 September 2019,"""Rambo: Last Blood"" (2019 release; 89 min.) is the continuing story of John Rambo. As the movie opens, we watch Rambo on his Arizona ranch. Taking care of Rambo is ol' faithful Maria, who lives there with her granddaughter Gabriela. Gabriela is about to start college, and Rambo is like a father to her. Then one day, Gabriela tells Maria and Rambo that she has located her real dad in Mexico, and she wants to visit him. Gabriela ignores the warning of both Rambo and Maria, and crosses the border into Mexico... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot (such as it is) would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the fifth Rambo movie, 11 years after the previous one. As you may know, the 5th movie was announced a decade ago and has been in development hell for YEARS. Now that the movie is finally here, it is easy to see why this is by far the weakest in the once (and still?) proud Rambo franchise. We don't bother anymore with Rambo being in Thailand or Birma or Vietnam. All we need to do is to have Gabriela cross the border into Mexico, and trouble is sure to stir up. Yep, that's how weak and underdeveloped the script is. This tired franchise has simply run out of ideas, I'm sorry to say. Sylvester Stallone, now a crisp 73 years young, is the only reason why I'm not rating this movie one or two star instead of three stars. ""I know how black one man's heart can be"", warns Rambo when Gabriela wants to see her dad. Does she heed the well-intended warning? Nooooooooooo! And that's how we end up with this film... Please note that the North American cut only runs 89 min (and that includes about 10 min. of closing credits, I'm not kidding). In most international markets, the movie runs 101 min., including a 10 min. opening scene that I guess was deemed too ""difficult"" for the North American market, hence the dumbed-down release for us...""Rambo: Last Blood"" opened last weekend, and I finally saw it in its second weekend. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati in a large theater was attended dismally (3 people in total).

58,subxerogravity,Old Rambo works for me,7,23 September 2019,"So it's not that bad of a flick. Cause we are all thinking it. Sly is too old to play Rambo. It's not like with Creed cause Rocky is not in the ring. They got a younger guy to do the fighting and Balboa gets to be the mentor. John Rambo is still in the fight, and as unbelievable as it is that one man can go up ageist an army of cops, Vietnam refugees, Iraq rebels, etc... it's even harder when that same man is now a senior citizen, but what does make Sly a decent filmmaker is that fact that he knows this too. He's well aware that Danny Glover's famous catch phrase includes him. So he designed a movie base on that. John Rambo is fighting a fight he thinks he knows but he's entering a world that he knows nothing about. He gets tossed around and beat up proving that he's just a man (Although in real life if a 70-something year old man took this beating, he'd be dead), but in the end, Rambo proved that his best weapon is his mind (Despite how wacked out of it he might be)and used it to rage some action packed bloody hell. It's a quick time at the movies with a 60 min story about how Rambo found peace only to have it snatch away from him. Then it's 29mins of pure mindless violence that totally satisfies in a way only an 80s action hero can.
Give mad credit to Stallone, he knows how to come back to a character. Despite a typical archetype of a story use to move the minutes along it was performed with a darkness that only a man who knows his character can do. It's a story that gets dark and it only makes Rambo's thrust for blood even better when he goes for vengeance.

59,jtindahouse,Like a very adult version of 'Home Alone',8,2 December 2019,"I was a little bit worried about 'Rambo: Last Blood' at the start. The opening scene was very uninspiring (and felt extremely tacked on to the rest of the film) and then 'Rambo' without long hair really threw me. It just didn't feel like 'Rambo'. The film then patiently set up its story and introduced us to some new characters. And then the film just exploded and became everything I wanted and more.The levels of violence in this movie are insane. Like even 2019 insane. I loved it. That's what I want to see from a 'Rambo' movie, is absolutely nothing held back. I don't know what the body count for this movie was but it must be incredibly high. Also all the villains are set up really well. We are made to truly hate them, which makes it so much better when 'Rambo' starts doing his thing. The final 20 minutes or so of this movie are incredible. It's a quite amazing action sequence that has to be seen to be believed.The amount of people sent to kill one man is kind of ridiculous. Like imagine if they just got there and instantly shot him on his porch. About 150 people would be kind of annoyed they made the trip. Also (and this is nothing new but it is still a problem) you almost need subtitles for 'Rambo' in some scenes. It can be pretty hard to pick up exactly what he's saying.

60,DarkVulcan29,The war ain't over till Rambo says it's over.,8,23 September 2019,"I really liked the last Rambo film which came in 2008 and really felt it was the end of an era, but Sylvester Stallone felt there was one more story to tell.
I rather not go to deep in the story, because I don't feel like giving away any spoilers. All just say it's everything you would expect in a Rambo movie. Stallone does gives more to the character Rambo this time, his performance is enjoyable to watch. And the bad guys here are about what to expect, to the point you'll be waiting when Rambo is gonna go at it with them. Is it has good as Rambo(2008), no. But still entertaining nothing more.

61,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,26 September 2019,"So I'm going ahead and giving this 10 out of 10 stars, not because I think it deserves it, but because there is a 1 star review entitled ""White Supremacy is Cancer"" and that seems to be the concept of a LOT of negative reviews.However, I have actually seen it and I can 100% guarantee that it has NOTHING to do with the content of those reviews. None of that is mentioned or implied.HOWEVER, there are negative reviews that ultimately say that this is NOT a Rambo film... and that is fair. If you compare it to Rambo First Blood Part II, III, and Rambo the 1 star reviews make sense. It is not at all like 2-4... so if you are expecting a Rambo like the sequels you're probably not going to like it... but you are probably not going to like it for entirely fair reasons.I won't fault you for that negative review.It's a lot more like the first film. More like Rambo First Blood... only instead of the military it's a drug cartel and instead of chasing Rambo he's... kind of... chasing them.... kind of... for revenge.Like all the other Rambo movies, it's formulaic. Once more we start off with Rambo trying to get out of the business, and this time he has gotten out and been adopted as an ""Uncle"" by a Latino family.And to follow the formula, like in the Godfather, he gets pulled back in. This time the daughter of said Latino family leaves to track down her family, goes to cartel occupied Mexico, and gets promptly kidnapped, sending Rambo on a blood crazed path to get her back and deliver vengeance on the cartels.Unlike the sequels, however, it's a little more of a slow burner. It takes a little more time to set up the characters, it takes a little more time to set up the plot and the relationships, and (shockingly given that in most of the Rambo films the enemy is almost faceless he's so under-developed) it actually takes a little time to set up the heavy as well.And in the end there is a lot of killing, a lot of elderly action, and ultimately a lot of fun... but what there is not a lot of is political messaging... because, at it's heart, it's just another action movie.Which leads me to the third type of negative review... the reviews critical of it being an action movie... those I don't understand... It's a Rambo movie, you know exactly what it is... and action movie... so what kind of film did they think they were going to see?",Rambo - Last Blood
62,jadavix,"Rambo goes ""Death Wish""... or is it ""Home Alone""?",3,22 December 2019,"With this latest entry, Stallone has even managed to mess up the only thing anyone could remember about the 2008 Rambo reboot: the violence.That one was entertaining because of the absurdity of the carnage on screen. It was like the nightmares of an ultra-right-wing ex-green beret. Or the sweet dreams?Yes, ""Last Blood"" is violent. So how does it mess it up, you ask? For one thing, it takes over half the movie before it even delivers on a little bloodshed. Then it makes you wait another twenty minutes for more underwhelming violence. And then you wait about another twenty minutes, and FINALLY the movie delivers with a violent conclusion in which Rambo has set numerous ridiculous traps around his house for the bad guys to stumble into.The parts that aren't violent are just so tedious and enervating. Rambo is not a multi-dimensional character. He's a killing machine. Giving him relationships and trying to make us care about him is a waste of time. Trying to make us care about the other characters is also a waste of time.If you've seen the previous Rambo flick, you might not be surprised that ""Last Blood"" features a scene in which Rambo interrogates a man by ripping his collar bone out. It does seem kind of odd, however, that the movie expects us to believe Rambo is a big softy, who does it all for some random girl... and yet is still capable of that level of ridiculous violence. In one scene, he is seen casually dropping a human head out the window of a moving car, as a serial killer might!It's not that hard to make a wall-to-wall violent flick about a human killing machine. They did it once before. What were they thinking with all the unnecessary plotting, padding, and idiotic end narration?Maybe watch a clip of the violent scenes on YouTube - I assume one will surface, if it hasn't already - and save yourself the time I just spent sitting through this garbage.",Rambo - Last Blood

Or My Mom Will Shoot; Paz Vega-Kill the Messenger, The Spirit; Yvette Monreal-The Fosters_tv, Matador_tv and Sergio Peris_Mencheta-The Evil That Men Do, Resident Evil:Afterlife.
This is the 5th in the Rambo series and supposedly, the last. But, as usual, that depends on how much money it makes. Sylvester has short hair for the first time playing Rambo, and is living peacefully on a ranch in New Mexico. Yvette is an 18 year old girl living with him that he has raised as a daughter, since her real father abandoned her. She wants to go to Mexico and confront her real daddy about why he left her but Sylvester tells her it's not a good idea. Sylvester knows him and says he is just good riddance. But, being a teenager, she takes off anyway and gets into trouble with Sergio and his sex trafficking business. Sylvester has to sharpen his old combat skills and go after her. Paz plays a reporter that helps Sylvester down in Mexico. The violence is brutal and a lot like it was in the last Rambo movie so if you have an allergy against seeing lots of blood, you might want to avoid this movie. Otherwise, sit back and enjoy watching a 73 year old man still kicking ass. As the end credits start, they show clips from previous Rambo movies but there is nothing at the very end.
It's rated ""R"" for strong graphic violence, grisly images, drug use and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 29 minutes.

Leader Trump has been consistently warning our American Homeland against the Perfidious Land of Mexico, and now we have RAMBO: LAST BLOOD backing him up 110%. This movie painstakingly documents how Mexico kidnaps the innocent budding blossoms of U.S. Womanhood, only to lure or drag them into their southern nether region of Filthy Perdition, drugging, maiming, and despoiling them during the brief time they're allowed to remain alive. When 48 heavily-armed Mexican Terrorists pack into eight SUV's while invading America, the heroic ""John Rambo"" deals with them in the only way possible: Rambo viciously slaughters each and every one of them, ending their lives of crime with Extreme Prejudice. Certainly RAMBO: LAST BLOOD more than justifies Leader Trump's retroactive curtailing of the ""Birthright Citizenship"" scam (as well as bolstering his National Emergency Order to deport ALL U.S. occupants sharing ANY of the genetic background of these born terrorists back to Mexico UNLESS they can document a 10-generation ancestry of arrest-free Good Conduct).

However, his character has continued to be rather a bore and the plot and script are highly derivative and overall very lame. It's all very much like watching Home Alone, in that you come to see the violent climax where the bad guys get it in increasingly over the top ways - the preamble is neither here or there.

When Stallone came back w/2008's Rambo, he attempted to get away from the slick action trappings of the series' middle entries and stick the landing ala his other iconic character w/ 2006's Rocky Balboa. From an artistic standpoint it's hard to say he accomplished this, but the film itself was moderately entertaining, and though it was hyper-violent--almost to the point of absurdity--it had a bit more dramatic meat on its bones than either Rambo II or III. It was also a modest hit, ensuring that calls for one more Rambo would continue.W/Last Blood, we see an elderly but still capable John Rambo, still tortured by his past, and a plot that feels very much of the moment.

69,jimbo-53-186511,Last Blood is John Rambo's most personal mission and it's definitely not for the squeamish,7,15 June 2021,"Still haunted by past events John Rambo is trying to keep a lid on his raging emotions and now lives his later years on a secluded ranch with his young niece and her grandmother. When Rambo's niece makes the ill-judged decision to try and locate her father in Mexico she ends up being kidnapped by the cartel. Upon hearing the news, Rambo must call upon his old skills to rescue his niece before it's too late....I thought First Blood was a terrific film, but have found everything else that followed to be a little bit disappointing so didn't really know what to expect from this fifth instalment. The truth is, at least as far as I'm concerned, Last Blood is the best offering since First Blood.Perhaps what gives the film an edge over some of its predecessors is that it is more personal in nature; in some of the earlier films Rambo was assigned to/completed missions more out of a sense of duty then anything else; sure you always got the feeling he cared about the people he was helping to an extent, but aside from the first film I generally found myself being a little emotionally detached and therefore could never find the sequels quite as satisfying.In this instalment because it is a family member that Rambo has to rescue there is already an emotional connection; it's also clear that Rambo's first rescue attempt is driven more by rage and emotion; normally Rambo would carefully plan any kind of rescue mission, but as it is one of his family he just bulldozes in and ends up being overwhelmed. Poor planning is understandable in this film as Rambo just wants to save his niece as quickly as possible and rational thought is not at the forefront of his mind at this stage. This shows a vulnerability with Rambo that we perhaps hadn't witnessed much of since the first film and starts to show more of a human touch to him.An incident later in the film causes Rambo to set up his campaign against the Cartel which leads to a thrilling finale which felt closer to First Blood; a tension filled climax where Rambo must pits his wits against the cartel and try to thwart their attack at seemingly impossible odds. It was this aspect that I loved about the first film and I'm so glad that we get to see a lot of the Rambo of old in Last Blood.Given the personal nature of this film, Rambo is understandably peed off and he is at his most brutal in this film so if you're squeamish or aren't a fan of gory violence then be warned; then again it is Rambo so surely you'd know how these films play out by now.Last Blood surprised me as I genuinely didn't expect much from it, but the script made me care for Rambo and see him as a person again which is something I've not really witnessed since the first film. That coupled with its fairly quick pace and its gripping finale made it a very satisfying and enjoyable film.",Rambo - Last Blood

The movie lacks character introduction of the other characters and everything is shown in very hush hush manner.The plot and storyline is predictable but screenplay is tight. Action and stunts are great. Acting by Stallone is impressive but other characters lacks the depth probably because the characters are not made up perfectly.Going by the climax it seems that this is the final movie of the franchise but honestly the Rambo will be missed.Must watch for Rambo and Sylvester Stallone fans",Rambo - Last Blood
71,yusufpiskin,Disney+ is working on a remake from Home Alone w/ J.

It doesn't really care about telling some grand narrative about drug lords, being American or any other social theme the plot of ""fighting off Mexican drug lords"" might bring to the table. The film understands what the audience for this kind of film wants and plays to those strengths.The set up to the plot is forced and becomes threadbare by the third act. Mainly there to facilitate the action, which the film excels in.The last act is essentially Home Alone Rated R and it's the films only saving grace. Watching Rambo decimate the drug lord goons and eviscerating them all in the process makes it seem like us feel like fans at the sports game watching our hometown hero get a homerun. It's fun, exciting and celebratory with how it's presented.Rambo V: Last Blood is the kind of film you buy cheap online and get a couple of friends together, get drunk and have fun watching it go terribly wrong.I'd recommend it as a fun, schlocky action flick.",Rambo - Last Blood
72,cjonesas,[6.8] Not doing justice to John Rambo as he is remembered,7,24 June 2020,"The title is a movie, which screenplay and story begs for a not too lengthy review as it has basically little depth and runtime.
Truly speaking, as a Rambo fan, I expected more of it, but was taken aback and disappointed.The story is shallow and weak. Even in its current state, it could have been more elaborate and believable.The runtime of the movie is not enough (whether cut or edited) and another 20-30 minutes would have been better suited, contributing more strongly to its quality.The acting is nothing special overall and because of the weak story, it soon becomes forgettable.So, if the minuses prevail so much, why does it get a rating of around ""7""; IMO, that's mostly because of the third and ending part of the movie and the action-packed revengeful scenes. Accounting all that, at the end, we have a movie with John Rambo in it, but lacking the feel and vibe of the Rambo movies, especially the 1982 and 1985 ones.'Rambo: Last Blood' ends the series on a not so satisfying note, but its character and Sylvester Stallone should be honored and deserve recognition for bringing to life a very strong, capable and relatable character and always entertaining us against all odds.",Rambo - Last Blood
73,kirbylee70-599-526179,FITTING FINALE?,8,27 January 2020,"It was 1982 and times were different. We were still talking about the effects of the Vietnam War on the combatants who came home. The term PTSD wasn't really spoken much but the condition existed. Then a movie came out that focused on what could happen. That movie was RAMBO and an ex-soldier was unnecessarily provoked and was unleased. The movie was a huge hit solidifying star Sylvester Stallone as a box office draw and resulting in three sequels. Now the fourth sequel, RAMBO: LAST BLOOD arrives on disc and it may be the last.John Rambo (Stallone) has returned home, living on a ranch in Arizona his father owned with an old friend Maria Beltran (Adrianna Barraza) and her granddaughter, Gabriela (Yvette Monreal). All of this is ten years removed from the last film. Gabriella is about to go to college but before she goes she wants to meet the father that left her and her mother years ago. An old friend named Gizelle now living in Mexico tells her she's found him.Rambo tells her the he's not worth the effort, that he was a bad man and that bad men never change. Of course she ignores him, heads for Mexico and meets up with Gizelle who takes her to meet her father. He tells her that he never wanted her and to leave which results in Gizelle taking her out to a club to get over her hurt feelings. And into the arms of human traffickers who will use Gabrielle as a heroin hooked prostitute.When she doesn't return home and they find she never arrived where she was supposed to, Rambo heads for Mexico to find her. Questioning Gizelle he goes to the club and follows the man that kidnapped Gabrielle. The end result is that he's spotted and the gang that did so beats him bloody. They allow him to live but carve their symbol on his cheek promising to do the same to Gabrielle.Watching the gang at the same time is Carmen Delgado (Paz Vega), an independent journalist whose sister was kidnapped, used and killed by the same gang. She takes Rambo home with her and has a doctor tend to his wounds. He heals and after hearing her story he heads out to rescue Gabrielle from the brothel she is now working in.No spoiler alert but eventually Rambo makes his way home. He takes the time to plot his revenge on the men who did this to Gabrielle and all the other women they forced into slavery. The farm is littered with tunnels seen early in the film, reminders of the life that Rambo once led, the battles he suffered in Vietnam. Placing traps within these tunnels, digging more and getting ready to go to war, his war, he finishes and heads south.Provoking the traffickers is easy and another spoiler I won't mention. They will be angered and they will come for Rambo. But as we've learned in the previous films, many have tried and many have failed. The question is, this being LAST BLOOD, will they succeed or not?Let's be honest, we all pretty much know what to expect when it comes to Rambo movies, right? And yet even knowing for the most part what is coming up, we flock to watch the latest installment. The best part about them has been that every single sequel has lived up to the standards set by the previous film and this one is no different. You can still cheer on Rambo and be amazed that Stallone at age 73 he's still in good enough shape to make another film in the franchise.The supporting cast on the good guy side does a solid job with Monreal playing the innocent well enough to be convincing. Vega is used sparingly and could have done more. Oscar Jaenada as bad guy pimp Victor and Sergio Peris-Mencheta as his brother Hugo are effectively sleazy bad guys that you want to not only go down but to suffer along the way. Trust me, they will.The movie is not for the timid, filled with plenty of blood and gore as well as extreme violence. But again, that's to be expected, especially after what we saw in the last sequel. Action fueled and morally centered, the character of John Rambo has been a hero that we've cheered now for almost 40 years. This time out he may not survive. The end of the film leaves that undecided. My hope is that this is the final film. If so it will be a fitting finale.",Rambo - Last Blood
74,lukem-52760,THE BEST RAMBO FILM. A MASTERPIECE OF VENGEANCE & DESPAIR.,9,14 January 2020,"This new ""Rambo"" is a stark-raw, brutal & relevant Action Thriller, this is the legendary Stallone's greatest movie, the absolute best of his incredible Career in my opinion, here Stallone gives an honest raw & powerhouse performance as the always troubled loner that is ""John Rambo"" we've followed Rambo through the franchise & it feels like it's all been leading up this outstanding explosive final showdown with the scum of the world.
Stallone is grizzled & raw like an open wound full of hate & rage at a harsh unforgiving world, IT'S a performances that feels so true & brutally honest it's his best moments as an incredible Actor, an ageing Action hero legend that i grew up watching & loving.
The whole theme of sex trafficking is real, the Mexican Cartels are real, the violence is real infact the whole movie is drenched in scarily gritty realism, this is a hard core Thriller with a Vigilante Hero that we can really root for, i wish there was a real John Rambo out there doing this & taking out the evil scum of the world because in real life the scum get away with the sick depraved stuff they do.
This film rings so shockingly true to me!!!
There's moments of beauty amongst all the harsh brutality, like Rambo riding a horse with the young girl who is like a daughter to him & these small nuggets of Happiness are lovely & Rambo is at peace during this & that's a big thing for such a troubled & complex character, Stallone is great in every scene & brings his level of gritty realism along too.
So when the girl is taken by the evil Cartel it feels even more disturbing because she was Rambo's peace, his only beauty in such a dark world.Now the movie looks spectacular with it's sharp & neon glowing cinematography, it's clear & slick looking but with a gloomy tone to it.
The direction is excellent with a fast moving pace of suspense & the Action handled all too real for an aging Action hero in a modern world, everything is spot on & made well as is the very disturbing scenes of the poor imprisoned girls who are forced to inject heroin & are raped by vile sick monsters, like i said this is a harsh world shown here but it's all real too.
Mexico is shown as a sinister & extremely dangerous place because it is & this all does happen there Facts!!!
The final revenge showdown at Rambo's ranch is outstanding as an explosion of violence erupts accross & under his land & the evil Mexicans deserve the brutal Justice of John Rambo, these monsters we wanna see Die violently!!!
All in all i loved the movie & totally think it's Stallone's best film & the best of the Rambo franchise, it's also my personal favourite performance by Stallone.

The villains and their army will go after him. And he prepared his tunnel system with wicked traps for these people. When they arrive Rambo takes them out one by one as expected.Rambo: Last Blood is a pretty minimalist movie compared to Rambos of the past, which is fine, this time around it's about personal revenge. The story itself also works, except that it focuses too much on Rambo and very little for instance on the villains who come across as rather insignificant instead of malicious and threatening. Another problem is that it's one of those movies that saves the best for the very last, which it really shouldn't have. There was plenty to offer while Rambo was in Mexico but the movie takes care of all that too quickly and without much fanfare. But when things get going they sure get going. Things get very violent and bloody. Another plus is that Yvette Monreal is absolutely adorable. I get the impression that this movie would have worked better with a different director.

Rambo, now a horse breeder in Arizona, has been living w/a niece & her aunt (played by Oscar nominee Adriana Barraza) who is about to go away to college. She still has some unanswered questions on why her errant father left the household in the first place so she decides to cross the border to find him w/the help of a friend (who both Rambo & the aunt warn of her shaky character). No sooner than you can say ""I told you so"", the niece is betrayed by the friend who is sold into sex slavery. Rambo manages to track her down (after he gets the stuffing beat out of him & given a scar to boot by the reigning sex traffickers) but she's already in the final throes of heroin abuse succumbing to it as Rambo returns back home but not before he kills one of the brothers who branded him sending the surviving sibling to gather a strike force to wreck havoc on Rambo at his heavily fortified farm. What follows in the final act is a prolonged exercise in over the top gore not much seen in today's multiplexes which if the story weren't so Neanderthal in construction & execution would've made for a boneheaded but entertaining yarn.

Even so, Last Blood may not be as great as the last movie, it still is very good and I enjoyed it a lot. Taking the original plot from what was going to be the last Rambo film, where John is living back at home trying to live a peaceful life, but family matters bring him back to his violent nature. This time however, it is personal and Stallone goes Bronson style in taking down human traffickers in this grim tale of revenge. Before he turns back into the killing machine we all know and love, this shows a more human side to the man until darkness descends and he comfortably goes back to the violent world he knows best. This has the most in common with 70's and early 80's post Deathwish movies, but in a modern time and a bigger budget. I am reminded a lot of Rolling Thunder, which is still quite different than this and actually predates the original First Blood movie by several years. Rambo takes out these scumbags in a variety of different ways and is quite savage. In the brutal finale he uses his military training and experiences in Vietnam to dispatch his foes with what looks like relative ease. As a fan of the series Sly did not let me down and he is in better shape as senior citizen then lots of people(athletes even) that are half his age.",Rambo - Last Blood
79,s3276169,Fails to recapture the first film in the franchise.....,4,7 October 2019,"There's a certain sense of irony, when a Rambo franchise film that calls itself Last Blood tries so very very hard, to recapture the First Blood film.In my opinion the first film and only the first film, was, in fact, quite good. Driven, as it was, as much by a compelling human interest drama mixed with an action film.Last Blood tries and fails, to achieve the same ends. Why? To my mind its because the first film had a story that had a certain plausibility about it. You could understand why and how the main character Rambo was led down a path by events not, in a sense, of his choosing.By contrast, the latest film feels forced. It tries awkwardly to engineer a similar premise but its full of badly contrived plot elements. So much so,that it fails to gel into the overstated but nonetheless, believable, story found in the first film.Worse still, the violence is of the brutal, sensationalist variety. Its ugly stuff dragging this sorry film even further away from the original story where Rambo used violence with a certain savage restraint.Suffice to say, I hope this is the last film in this franchise.

The reviews for this were overwhelmingly negative, so I avoided seeing it in theaters, but those reviews also piqued my interest and made me seek this film out as soon as I could see it (without paying for it, of course).
While I won't claim that any of the Rambo movies have great or lasting cinematic merit, I will say they are fun, and, to some extent, I suppose you could say I'm a fan of the series. The first entry, ""First Blood"", is far more dramatic than one might expect, but it's actually a decent movie. ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" is where the series finds its legs and starts to stand as the hardcore action series it's known as today; that entry actually has some decent action and it's kind of a perfect time capsule of 80s action. ""Rambo III"" is just ridiculous; it's where the series starts to loose its focus, but I's also really dumb fun. The fourth entry, titled only ""Rambo"" is alright; it's essentially just a remake of ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"", except it's set thirty years later and is infinitely more violent and gorier than the other earlier entries in the series. It had been ten years since the last Rambo, and I was interested to see what Stallone could bring to the table for this 'final' entry (if there's still money coming in, they'll make more). I wasn't expecting much, but this was worse than I expected. Even if you've already seen all the other Rambo movies, you don't need to see this one. It comes off as incredibly schmaltzy, almost to the point where it felt like a parody of the rest of the series.",Rambo - Last Blood
81,TheFearmakers,Rambo: Last Blah,4,21 September 2019,"So far we've learned that RAMBO: LAST BLOOD has a lot in common with HOME ALONE since John J. defends his ranch using various booby traps. Which is nothing new: FIRST BLOOD had the Vietnam Vet/Green Beret luring antagonists into his ""territory"" with a hostile edge and cunning familiarity. The only difference now is he pays property tax.Also, the critics are blaming President Donald Trump for the choice of villain. Making him the only person who doesn't like a Mexican Drug Cartel that enslaves young girls?One in particular is pretty much everything, and boy is she pretty. Making this 90-minute melodramatic action programmer more similar to DEATH WISH 4: THE CRACKDOWN in which, for completely different reasons, the aged main hero's daughter-like ingenue overdoses on drugs, and from that point it's all about revenge, revenge, and more revenge...But it takes too long for that movie to actually start, and when it does, we're rushed through what feels like a montage of ultra-violent deaths that means more to the character than the audience...And Stallone's bitter yet wise and timeworn, horse-loving Rambo doesn't feel like the same legendary character except being good at killing his foes; plus the fact he frown/scowls before, during and after all the exploitative and sometimes literally explosive bloodletting.Ironically, with a title like LAST BLOOD, this feels more like the start-up/pilot of an AMC-Channel Rambo reboot. And while it's the dullest of the movies, it would probably be the worst episode of that imaginary series as well. Meanwhile, neither are or would be necessary. If this were ROCKY 7, he'd be shadowboxing. But at least there would be some decent competition.",Rambo - Last Blood
82,a_chinn,"John Rambo does Liam Neeson in a South of the Border version of ""Taken""",6,16 March 2020,"I was fairy excited about a new Rambo movie. The first film was an engrossing story about a drifter veteran who is pushed to his limit. This first film was something of an action film meditation on the plight of Vietnam veterans who fought for our country but who were never welcomed back home and who continued to be treated badly. The second film was a completely different film and is the type of 80s musclebound action flick Stallone became most closely associated with during this period of his career. The third film was the biggest budgeted film of the series, but now has some seriously dubious politics, with Rambo fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Mujahideen (who later became the Taliban and one of the United State's greatest enemies) against Soviet forces. That was supposed to be the end of the franchise, but an elderly Stallone 20-years later delivered a wildly brutal fourth installment which had him fighting in Burma. Seriously, the level of violence in that film topped most horror films! That brings us to ""Rambo: Last Blood"" where the story departs even further from the rest of the series. John Rambo is now on an Arizona ranch helping raise his niece, who becomes the victim of sex traffickers. It's then up to Rambo to rescue her, which he does, and then lures the sex traffickers back to his ranch for one hellacious final bloody battle (though that's after the baddies nearly kill Sly earlier in the film). Like Liam Neeson in ""Taken,"" Rambo has a particular set of skills, which includes boobytraps, knives, bow and arrows, and all sorts of guns. The film's final battle is something to behold for fans of over-the-top action, but the story leading up to it is almost insufferable in how serious it takes itself. If they had been developed right, a revenge story around sex trafficking would work, but in this film it simply serves as grist for Stallone to go all Rambo on the bad guys. It's a completely perfunctory set-up that only serves as an excuse to get to the boobytrap heavy finale, which really is great and reason enough to watch the film, which is why I gave this film 3 out of 5 stars. I think I'd have been just as happy if DEA agents recruited senior citizen Rambo to help them take down a drug cartel instead of this nonsense with his niece. Overall, ""Last Blood"" is the weakest of all the Rambo films and barely seems connected to the rest of the series. My advice is to skip to the last 25 minutes of the film and you'll enjoy it much more.",Rambo - Last Blood
83,masonsaul,Great end to the franchise,8,21 September 2019,"Despite some generic elements, Rambo: Last Blood is a great end to the Rambo franchise.

Adrian Grunberg's direction is also really good and the musical score by Tyler Bates is great. There's also some surprisingly emotional moments.",Rambo - Last Blood
84,rgkarim,Drawing Lots Of Blood,8,21 September 2019,"He's the man with a mug and muscles. A legendary collection of characters whose stories continue to hold their place in history and face the test of time. Surprisingly, he manages to continue putting those stars of decades past into the modern times so that they can continue to rake in the attention, fame, and potentially tell a story doing it. I'm talking about Sylvester Stallone, the one-man action star who despite the passing years still does what he can to bring the boom. Tonight's feature is an unretired action legend that decades ago sunk his knife into our hearts, and now years later, he's trying to do it again with modern tools. What is in store? Well that's where I come in to give some insight as Robbie K is back with another look at:
LIKES:Stallone's character still adapting
Great use of cinematography to get the feeling
Touching Side of Rambo
The Rambo Action Package At The End
MontageDISLIKES:Predictable
Lacking Depth
Wasted Characters
Lame Villains
First hour is cliché, simplistic build up
A Little Too Much Focus Of Blood
Inconsistencies in this film's logic
The VERDICTOverall, Rambo: Last Blood has the same simplistic approach the rest of the movies have done, but they did not quite execute as well for me. The story elements were sacrificed for superficial components, and the definition of action packed is a little different from my worldview. Sure, it's all about building up a justified tale of vengeance, and it does open up the side of Rambo that is outside the rugged stoicism that he loves. Yet, the modern take of extreme, weak villains, underutilized characters, and focus on the blood took away from the balance the first film did so well. Still, I'll agree with my fellow reviewers that if you are a die-hard fan and want the modern technology to blend with it, this fil is for you. All others, I would hold out for, and for everyone please don't take those that are too young to this blood fest.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Thriller: 7.5

The story goes that Rambo goes after a Drug Cartel in Mexico to save his daughter. Not wanting to give too much away, but that's the gist of it until you go see this yourself!The films violence did not disappoint! It was cranked up to the bone braking maximum & slammed down in a steel slicing, explosive climax! The blood & gore was simply epic! The viciousness of the film was pure Rambo & it didn't let up either! Not even for a nano second!The end climax was something else, it was Home Alone on steroids basically! Again, I don't want to give too much away as the film is simply non stop action in a lean 1 hour & 19 minutes! You have to see this! Words cannot describe it!The critics are clearly talking Bull & have this film all wrong! This film deserves better ratings & praise than what the hate & mindless slandering it is actually getting! It's great that in this hyper sensitive world we live now that a film like this challenges what our society has now sadly evolved into! This film is epic!

Crossing the Mexico border to bring her home he finds himself up against one of Mexico's most ruthless cartels. This is the fifth installment in the Rambo film series. Having lived a life being treated as an expendable mercenary, John Rambo's story concluded in the previous film with him returning home once more. But, this time the character arc overreaches with a derivative, hyperviolent revenge tale. Many scenes are deadening and repetitive in their barbarity with no attempt to reflect on the veteran's PTSD. The perfunctory attempt at a plot means the third act plays out with remarkable predictability. That said, there are moments of poignance - a relationship between an affectionate surrogate father and an innocent teenager. Stallone's septuagenarian has a palpable vulnerability which makes scenes of danger more charged here than in previous films. The production values are high and the sound design is impressive, but the film feels like an adjunct.",Rambo - Last Blood
90,arungeorge13,Not the legacy that Rambo should have left behind! [+34%],3,2 December 2019,"Rambo: Last Blood, unfortunately, doesn't hold a candle to the rest of the films in the franchise. It plays out like a generic action film that goes 'guns, weapons, and gore'-blazin' in its finale. While it did give hints of Rambo's persistent inner turmoil, Last Blood is not the gory legacy that Rambo would have wanted to leave, in my eyes. It's the Max Payne 3 of the Rambo series - there's practically no real purpose for its existence, yet the only reason it does is to give its titular character a proper goodbye. I'm sure Last Blood fails to hold up that end of the bargain either. It simply feels like the end of another chapter in John's life.The storyline isn't one we'd want to watch a character like Rambo in. There are scenes that justify its R-rating and gorehounds should be reasonably pleased with the final 20-minute action set-piece, even if it all barely registers. Stallone's performance isn't one to be blamed here; every character other than his felt stock and underwritten. The antagonists are the worst: they're so tiringly one-note than even the laziest action screenplay writer can do a lot better. Some might contend that the climactic R-rated Home Alone-esque showdown is probably what this franchise needed more of, but even then, the set-piece doesn't feel utterly fresh and innovative.You can replace John Rambo with any of Liam Neeson's action-movie characters from the last decade and the film wouldn't play out any differently. That's how plain the writing here is. If 'brutal violence for the sake of brutal violence' in cinema is your cup of tea, then there's a faint chance that you may find Last Blood a wee bit entertaining. For everybody else, I doubt it! I love the John Rambo character and I remember cheering the hell out for his Burmese outing. But Last Blood just doesn't comprise the expected jolts that (the supposed final entry of the) franchise badly needed.",Rambo - Last Blood
91,Abdulxoxo,"If nothing else, it's entertaining",6,7 January 2021,"The story follows John Rambo who is living happily at a ranch, tending to horses with his niece Gabrielle. Wanting to know the truth about her estranged father, she travels to Mexico, where she finds herself in trouble. Rambo comes down to rescue her; a mission which leads to gang leader Hugo Martinez driving up to Rambo's home in search of revenge. What awaits the gang upon arrival however they could not have seen coming.This film is very derivative and generic of many other revenge movies. The plot is fairly thin and ultimately predictable. Also the script is mediocre, to the extent that the cast really struggle to make much out of it, despite their best efforts. I think the most disappointing thing for me though was the editing - in particular the way in which the most violent scenes were cut incredibly quickly, almost as if to shield the audience from the gruesomeness of the lingering pain. There are plenty of inventive, violent kills; but because almost all of them are cut away from so quickly, that took a sick pleasure away for me. The cinematography is very good, some of the desert shots are really nice to look at and the score is fitting and complements the narrative very well.
·Overall, Rambo last blood is an unnecessary instalment in the Rambo franchise. The performances are good and the action are quite thrilling but the direction and script left much to be desired.",Rambo - Last Blood
92,omendata,Minimal story and a bit lacklustre,6,8 December 2019,"Watched John Wick 3 last night and was very disappointed - this is marginally better but in short minimal story , lots of action but very dark scenes so you could not see the bad guys getting eviscerated in full effect and it all seemed over far too quickly unlike John Wick 3 which just dragged on and on with implausible and bad fight choreography whereas this had potential squandered.Bad guys were not bad enough and not enough carnage - where was the rocket launcher and Battery powered machine gun that Arnie withered a forest with in Predator. Did like the Malay gates and kurhkri pits but once again too dark to see much which is a shame - we want mayhem and carnage from Rambo and all we got was crash, bang, wallop and its over.Cudos to the writers for not giving us the usual damsel is saved in the nick of time and it really should have taken off after he snapped the guys collar bone and dug deep = it had promise but withered on the vine - it was as f they rushed the end of the movie somehow and left me feeling very dissatisfied and if they had just let the rocking char go still at the end with Rambo taking a graceful exit but no we had to have the cliched Pale Rider riding off into the sunset...nah just nah....The score also had lost its dynamic compared to Rambo 4 which is my favourite along with the original First Blood and should have contributed to the action but sadly it was not up to scratch either.Sylvester does look a lot better than he did in Escape Plan II and shows there is still life n the old war-dog yet but something has happened to his voice which I am not sure if it was dubbed in parts in the movie either.Bit of a disappointment but a fair above average 6/10 from me on this one!",Rambo - Last Blood

Whilst it had an uncomplicated linear narrative there were nods to Taken, Dirty Harry and even a musical fight sequence, (drawn from X-men, Pulp Fiction or John Wick).After Sly Stallone's brilliant performance in Creed II he does a really solid job here, again you have to like Mr Stallone for doing stuff his way and we don't expect Shakespeare.Overall it was a great night out, yes it was violent, yes it was absurd in places, but much of it was quite tongue in cheek and self referential.",Rambo - Last Blood

It feels like another Stallone film, but at the last second, they tried hard to make it be a 'Rambo' film, if that makes any sense. It's like they mixed 'Taken' and 'The Last House on the Left' together and turned it into 'Rambo 5' But I loved the final showdown at the farmhouse. It was awesome, bloody, and brutal. Here's where it kinda resembles a Rambo film.Ten years after the events in Burma, John Rambo is trying to live a peaceful life on his father's ranch. He's still dealing with PTSD, but he has an old friend, Maria Beltran, and her granddaughter, Gabriela to keep him company. Gabriela becomes like a daughter to him. She wants to find her father in Mexico, but Rambo forbids it. Gabriela goes anyway and tracks him down. She soon realizes he wants nothing to do with her. Soon enough, she's taken by the Mexican Cartel and forced to be a prostitute.When John Rambo tries to get her back, he's beaten to a pulp, so he sets his sights on revenge. They drew 'first blood' so Rambo will draw last. This time, the war is very personal. They say this is the last film, but it was kinda open ended.

As a Rambo fan, I found this film worth the price of admission. I saw it in 4DX and the effects made the action scenes a lot more enjoyable. Sylvester Stallone just proved that action heroes can't be stopped by their age as it's just a number.Story-wise, it might not be the best in the series as it has a plot at times similar to Taken and other action movies about kidnapping: a plot that has been told over and over since years. Nevertheless, the film's execution is excellent and that matters more than the freshness of the plot. Plus, the film made me want more when it ended. At that point, I was like what? Is that all? I didn't want it to end. It was that good.Sylvestor Stallone has carried the whole film on his shoulders. Action sequences are as expected, mind-blowing! I was surprised to see minimal censoring here in India. Even John Wick Chapter 3 was less gory than this film but got censored while this film kept the gory action intact. That's impressive. It was so well done that I found myself cheering for Rambo throughout.This film is definitely worth watching as it's exactly what fans would want it to be.

Rambo fights with kidnapper's gang to save his daughter. Nothing new. There are two parts one is kidnapping of daughter of Rambo and second is revenge from Rambo. My objection is that the first part sequences are in realistic way but on other hand revenge drama is totally looks dramatically and illogical even we feel that all are arranged intentionally. It was not necessary for kidnappers' gang to go after Rambo's home. And Rambo could save his daughter with using his mind & power in his first attempt whereas he is captured by goons easily. This makes movie loose its importance and effect otherwise it would be a great revenge drama. You can feel this while watching this movie. So it is not much recommended.

Wealth, power and fame produces lethargy of a sort and while this movie will make money Mr. Stallone I ask you: Don't you have enough already? Why didn't you make an effort to spend some of it on a decent script? I enjoyed seeing you in the role but was disappointed with what you did with it.

Here, I think he lacks the judgment necessary to act on what he has learned over the years and various encounters that helped refine his skills. I applaud the story of a man walking toward an uncomfortable situation but how and why he chose this way is what puzzled me. We are introduced to the second bite of the apple principal where someone gets a second chance. It could have been carried out better or eliminated completely considering this is Rambo who doesn't need a second chance when he knows the odds going in. Barring all that with all the money, power and pull Stallone has why couldn't the script be outstanding to the point where you want to see it again?

104,fmarkland32,Blood from a turnip,4,28 July 2020,"Rambo returns now long past his killing machine mode and civilian mode where his daughter by proxy is abducted by Mexican drug syndicate and are sex slavers in this tired and unnecessary sequel. Rambo V is disappointing for a simple reason that the script is just awful. Like Rambo V is a straight to video movie that somehow has been named Rambo, only to turn into Home Alone. Again most of this is really lazy and pedestrian, indeed a lot of it reminds me of Death Wish V in how Bronson depended more on booby traps than bodycount machine guns. In the 90s when I saw that (in theaters, believe it or not) there was a sort of watchable edge, and a great performance from Michael Parks as the villain, Rambo V lacks that villain, it also turns Rambo into an idiot who make absurd mistakes. Like just walking up to said drug lords, instead of you know being covert and setting up traps. Rambo does later do this to save said proxy daughter and killing a Mr. Big type, but it begs the question why he didn't do it earlier. The answer is simply the script stinks. Rambo V then isn't so bad, so much as it is routine. It's the type of movie that is so forgettable it evaporates from memory seconds after you leave the theater. To be fair, there is a poetic ending of Rambo sitting on a rocking chair, but aside from that and the Home Alone carnage of the climax, Rambo V is yet another uninspired nostalgic cash grab.* * Out Of 4-(Fair)",Rambo - Last Blood
105,phubbs,Rambo: Last Blood,4,19 January 2021,"Holy schnitzel they're still making these movies?! So now we have 'Last Blood', a continuation from 'First Blood'. K I see what they did there...ugh! Am I to presume this is the final movie in this long-drawn-out milked franchise? Probably not.So John Rambo is essentially retired from killing people and is now living a peaceful life on his Arizona ranch. He lives there with help from an old friend and her granddaughter Gabriel. So everything is dandy until Gabriel discovers the location of her biological father somewhere in Mexico through her friend (also in Mexico). Despite warnings from her Gran and Rambo she runs off anyway to find him. Low and behold she gets herself kidnapped by some stereotypical bad guys and Rambo must save the day.The problem with this movie is it doesn't feel like the right kind of send-off for the franchise, if it's meant to be that? The plot is incredibly trashy and felt more like an old throw-away, top shelf, lower-level sequel. This felt more like the type of sequel that would result from franchise fatigue further resulting in the franchise getting axed. In no way did this feel like a grand send-off for a legendary cinematic hero like John Rambo.Everything moves very quickly in this movie with little time for you to care about anything. Before we know it Gabriel is off ignoring advice and getting kidnapped. Rambo is then off to rescue her, gets beaten, heals up, and he's back again to amp things up. Then before we know it the bad guys have driven all the way from Mexico to Arizona to kill Rambo. Apparently the border didn't stop multiple cars with lots of armed men in tactical gear? Am I to presume the border guards were crooked? Or maybe they didn't go through an armed border section? Also I get that Rambo is a tough guy but why didn't he call the police?Rambo's ranch has lots of self-made tunnels underneath which obviously come into play for the big finale. The whole thing is so painfully predictable and cliche really. Like Rambo has to have all these tunnels just so he can do his homemade booby trap thing à la his Nam days. And they are really big and extensive too! But yeah this is all an excuse to have lots of nasty gruesome booby trap deaths and so Rambo can use a multitude of weapons. It's also amusing how the number of bad guys seems to grow in the finale as Rambo kills them. At first there seemed to be around twenty bad guys but it seems never-ending as Rambo kills them in various ways. At least it seemed that way, could be wrong.The cliches really quite numerous throughout. The area of Mexico Gabriel goes to is typically rundown with armed thugs hanging around on street corners. The first time Rambo approaches the bad guys main HQ he is spotted and dealt with quickly. The second time when he comes back for revenge he infiltrates the place with no problems. Where did everybody go? The female journalist character that helps Rambo after he gets beaten goes nowhere. She's just there to help him in that moment. When Gabriel dies Rambo apparently doesn't inform the authorities and just buries her in the backyard. And the bad guys treat the girls so badly that I wouldn't really have thought anyone would want to go with them in the state they are in. Just seemed counterproductive and needlessly brutal for the sake of it. Surely you'd want the girls to be attractive? Not beaten to a pulp.Addressing the over-the-top violence and xenophobia accusations. Is it violent? Yes. Is it overly violent? I didn't think so. I've seen much worse and frankly I think the previous Rambo movie was far more violent than this. What's more much of the violence was set in the dark and at times felt more akin to a horror flick. As for xenophobia, don't be silly people. It's just a stupid cheesy action flick with stereotypes. We see this all the time, I don't get the issue.This movie felt cheap and tacky to me, but not in a good way. Some horror flicks feel (or are) cheap and tacky but in a fun way which can lead to them becoming cults. This just felt dark, dingy, depressing, and cheap. Stallone is clearly too old for this which made things even more stupid. He looks grizzled and cool sure but clearly too old. The movie also hangs on people knowing Rambo's history from previous movies, so any young folk who haven't seen the older Rambo flicks could be confused about certain things (the tunnels for instance). But the worse thing about this is it could have been any character as the protagonist. This doesn't really feel like a Rambo movie, it could have been anyone. Stick in Denzel Washington or Liam Neeson and there you go, another 'Taken' or 'Equalizer', the plot fits those characters better. The previous movie was far better than this and it should have ended there.4/10",Rambo - Last Blood
106,rockman182,Rambo: Last Blood(2019),5,20 September 2019,"I'm not the super biggest fan of the Rambo series. First Blood is clearly the best of the bunch and was quality, showing the emotional turmoil of a war veteran. From there the films just got more violent and violent. Last Blood kind of came out of nowhere, and also seemed like it was the last of the bunch. While this being the final installment is still up in the air, I wish it definitely was the end. The film turns the violence up a notch but is extremely ordinary and rather uninspiring.The film shows an older John Rambo who lives on a farm with his niece. His niece is curious about meeting her estranged birth father so she unwisely decides to travel to Mexico. While there on a night out she finds herself kidnapped by the Mexican cartel with the intention of selling her into the sex trade. When Rambo hears of this he travels to Mexico to save his niece and make life for the gangsters very uncomfortable.The film plot itself is something too familiar and is like something we've seen too much. You can look at the xenophobic trends of the film and compare it to the current political climate but I think that I don't even need to comment on that to talk about how bad this film is. The plot moves so slowly in the beginning and is just unremarkable. The series quality has gone down and its just memorable now for its gore and violence. I have seen far more violent films in my time but this pleased the blood thirsty audience in the cinema.While the action is somewhat fun to watch, the film reeks of tiredness and is out of ideas. Sly just looks way older now and I don't want there to be another Rambo. Last Blood would be a poor way to close out the series but still I'd be happy if it ended it. However, I feel like Hollywood will try to churn out another one which will probably be even worse. Unremarkable and totally skippable.5/10",Rambo - Last Blood

108,RforFilm,"When the enemy draws first blood, Rambo: Last Blood gives us a short, but enjoyable run-and-gun movie with an older Stallone",6,23 September 2019,"In the past, I've talked about Stallone and his most iconic character, Rocky Balboa. But I haven't had a chance to talk about his second most popular character, John Rambo. To start with, there's a large difference in character. Rocky is an upbeat, optimistic boxer who only wants to help others, even putting them over himself. Rambo is the opposite monster. Rambo is an expert super solider whose trained in gruella warfare and survival. At that cost, his humanity is consistently lingering and has a hard time finding peace. Unlike Rocky who only fights in the boxing ring, Rambo is unafraid to knife anyone in his way or use a machine gun to blow an entire army.Because of their violent nature, the Rambo series has always been polarizing. I only consider the first one, First Blood, to be a phenomenal story from beginning to end. Rambo: First Blood Part II and beyond have made him in the ""one-man army"" that's often the subject when parodying 1980's action heroes. The other movies are still entertaining if I want my fair share of explosions and even a little history lesson depending on the enemy he's fighting. Rambo is back for another battle in Rambo: Last Blood.Things have been going well for John Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone). After finally returning to America in the last movie, he has taken over his late father's horse ranch in Arizona, along with a friend Maria (played by Adriana Barraza) and her granddaughter Gabriela (played by Yvette Monreal). Ever since her mother had died and her father abandoning her, Rambo has stepped into the father role as he's found new purpose in raising her. Though she's about to go to college, she still wonders about her father.Through a friend, she manages to locate him in a town in Mexico. When she asks to go, Rambo and her grandmother say no as her going by herself would be too dangerous. She still does and does pay her father a visit. Not only is she dismayed to find he still wants nothing to do with her, but when out clubbing with a friend, she is kidnapped and drugged by a Mexican cartel. When Rambo receives word, he immediately drives down to search for her. He discovers through journalist Carman (played by Paz Vega) that the cartel is run by the Martinez brothers. Will Rambo go into solider mode at age seventy-three? You better believe it.Rambo: Last Blood is the kind of movie I expect to watch in the late summer; a short but entertaining run-and-gun action movie with a star that proves he still packs that punch. It's also the kind of film I'd expect such a character to be in. Is it as good as the older movies? Well... the movie has a lot of opportunities that could be explored with John Rambo but don't. It depends on what kind of movie you'd expect.To begin with, Stallone may be getting up there in age, but he still has the energy from years before to pull off a lot of action stunts that people in their seventies wished they could do. But the movie does make itself aware he's a different Rambo; a Rambo in which he's settled down for a while and only wants peace. Of course he's still sharpening his knives and digging tunnels, but he now seems like the guy who will only pull the trigger when pushed far enough.Story wise, Rambo: First Blood is both at an advantage and a disadvantage. I do like seeing Rambo take on a Mexican cartel (any reports of the story being racist or offensive to Mexicans is untrue) and rescuing someone whose become like a daughter. The problem is that a lot that happens in the first hour doesn't feel like a Rambo movie. Much of the dialogue makes him a tad generic and could have been filled in by a random character. It honestly doesn't make him in Rambo until the last twenty minutes, which I won't spoil, but it was a lot of fun. It's also hard to complain as the movie is also the shortest of the Rambo movies (it's only eighty minutes).I'll give this six Rambo knives out of ten. Though it's not as good as the original, I would rank it higher then Rambo III (which I consider the goofiest). Whether this is for you depends on your opinion of the other Rambo movies. It was a short but enjoyable blast. You just have to wait through a more typical story to get to the good stuff.",Rambo - Last Blood
109,Holt344,"Rambo: Last Blood, a worthy sequel and ending",9,29 September 2019,"This is Sylvester Stallone at his finest, playing his iconic role John Rambo for what is probably the last tim and it's a great ending to a fantastic franchise of movies. He portrays Rambo, a Vietnam veteran that is suffering from PTSD better than ever almost and I really liked his acting in this movie, there is something unique and it's possibly his love for the character and role that he have formed into a baby of his own.I really enjoyed it, story wise and action wise. It's a fast paced movie but the story building in the first half is just amazing, creating this world that we're thrown into and the actors all did amazing work. The R-Rating is well used as the profanity feel natural and not forced and where the rating stands out is the violence. It's more violent and brutal than the predecessor and the other movies but it's there for a reason. Critics disliked the huge amount but they are wrong, it's well placed and a reason behind all the graphic violence, there were three or four scenes that was a bit overkill. The action was great, giving us a fresh experience with amazing action sequences and a throwback to First Blood's trap scenes which I personally loved then and now.

111,bankofmarquis,"Not really a ""Rambo"" flick...but kind of is...",6,24 September 2019,"The ""final"" installment in the Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo series of films (the 5th!) RAMBO: LAST BLOOD is one of those hybrid type of films that is really two 45-50 minute films put together to give you one 1 hour, 45 minute adventure. These two film-ettes are clear throwbacks to 2 other films.""Oh...you say...they are paying homage to previous RAMBO films, like the first one FIRST BLOOD and the best one RAMBO..."" and...that would make sense and give a reason for this character to re-emerge, but this is NOT what is happening here.The first half of this film has been done better as the Liam Neeson film TAKEN while the 2nd half of this film is a clear homage to HOME ALONE - or as I call it BLOODY HOME ALONE. So, instead of the crooks being comically hurt, they are dismembered, disemboweled, be-headed and run through the middle with pointy stuff.All with lots and lots of blood spurting everywhere.Inexplicably, Sylvester Stallone agreed to revise his John Rambo personae after 11 years away from it and he is showing every moment of his 73 years of age in this role. To say that Stallone is a little ""long in the tooth"" for this type of action/beat 'em up role would be doing a disservice to the term ""long in the tooth"".As is fairly typical in these types of films, the plot is fairly straightforward - John Rambo is living a peaceful existence until someone close to him is kidnapped by bad guys south of the border, so Rambo goes in search of her (that's the first half of the film - the TAKEN portion). And...this part of the film is...okay (just...okay). The ""good guys"" around Rambo are nice (enough) and he is joined by a crusading journalist who also has had someone kidnapped so you think he might be joined by a ragtag group of ""frenemies"" to fight a common enemy...but...Rambo goes in ""mano a mano"" (this is a Stallone/Rambo film after all) and this part of the film, ultimately, fails to deliver the goods and falls flat.Director Adrian Grunberg  sets up at the beginning of this movie some interesting side characters (the journalist, the one time bad guy who is now out of the bad guy business and might have a redemption-type arc, the plucky teenager) and some interesting character traits (PTSD, Concussion symptoms) that our hero is suffering from. All of these elements should have/could have been utilized to bring some interesting twists to the action scenes - but they are all quickly...and promptly...dropped to show Stallone being macho and killing bad guys on his way to fulfilling the goal of the first half of the film.And then comes the 2nd half.The bad guys come to Rambo's Ranch to exact some revenge (I can see a bobby-trapped Halloween-type walk through haunted house coming to a corn field near you this fall). Any pretense of plot, character development, etc. is gone in a hot minute as this part of the film is all about the bloody Home Alone-type booby-traps at the ranch. Wanna see someone get a pitchfork to the face? Check! Wanna see someone get their arm chopped off with a machete? Check! How about falling through a trap door onto some spikes? You got it! And it just gets bigger, bloodier and more comedicly-""awesome-gruesome"" as we go. If you enjoy this type of thing (and...I gotta admit...I do) then this is pretty entertaining.Ridiculous? Yes. Is Stallone too old for this type of film? Yes. Over-the-top? Of course. A good film with strong characters? Heck no.But that's not what we came to see. If you can get through the fairly slow (and poorly written) first half of this film, the 2nd half is bloody good fun.Letter Grade: B-6 stars (out of 10 - just know what kind of film you are watching) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis).",Rambo - Last Blood
112,fernandoschiavi,"Rambo's trajectory seeks to get close to the character's humanity. However, in the end, Stallone's pessimism seems to find its apex while the last drops of blood are spilled",6,13 September 2020,"Rambo franchise finally wins a last episode and tries to deliver a tribute but distorts the previous films and delivers a totally irregular and full of problems. Considering that it shouldn't have gone beyond the first film (whoever read the book by which it draws its base knows the reason), the Rambo franchise did a great job of keeping itself not only alive, but relevant. In a world in which Jewels of Infinity and ultra-realistic reinterpretations of classic drawings permeate the preference of moviegoers in 2019, the arrival of the fifth film in the series of the now Vietnamese soldier, now sixty years old, John Rambo brings a very welcome breath to put the viewer's feet on the ground and ignore, at least temporarily, excessively fanciful elements from other films. But make no mistake: like every good film with the trademark of Sylvester Stallone - who signs the script and the plot for this release - Rambo: Until the End (Rambo: Last Blood, in the original in English) is extremely ""liar"" in everyone the aspects. And you will really like the movie for that. That's all.Rambo: Last Blood is decades after John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) fought against his enemies. Now he has found peace on a ranch on the border between the United States and Mexico. There he helps Maria Beltran (Adriana Barraza) to raise her granddaughter Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal), who treats him with immense affection. Determined to find her father, who abandoned her as a child, she relies on the help of a friend who now lives in Mexico to locate him. Despite the wishes of her grandmother and Rambo, Gabrielle goes into hiding in the neighboring country and, after being released by her own father, ends up being sold to a gang that manages prostitutes. Alerted about what happened, Rambo decides to go to Mexico to save her.In just over an hour and a half, what follows is a patchwork of obviously segmented facts, all in order to deliver - just like the films that eternalized the franchise in the action films Hall of Fame - a sequence of scenes from culminating in a final confrontation, both simple in proportion and epic in meaning. Rambo is not in some distant country, isolated from the world and wallowed in mud, rain and self-pity, dealing with the post-traumatic stress of the Vietnam War. Here, we see a man who has all the tools to defend his home and family, and has no shame in using them.What, therefore, distinguishes the feature film from the rest of the franchise is the belief that this work, in the first instance, places on the human connections presented in the plot. The protagonist restored his faith in humanity, seeing, especially in Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal), his niece at heart, an opportunity for the world not to be the misfortune he saw in so many different opportunities in his life. Of course, the scars of war, on the other hand, remain visible. The character, for example, does not reside in the main house of the land, however, in underground tunnels that he has been building for years. The very way, moreover, as Rambo holds a knife and fork on the dinner table, already indicates the presence of anger intrinsic to his existence. However, the dynamics proposed by the first act of the feature are competent enough to contextualize the renewed scenario that the man underwent. The filmmaker Adrian Grunberg, in this case, stages this calmer beginning very well, having dramatic timing and giving space to interactions, important to justify the transformation in Rambo and, thus, enable the dramatic ties that will reverse it, resurrecting its most primitive aspect.
The hope rebuilt at the beginning serves, therefore, as the ultimate test for beings to be - or not - capable of resisting violence. For with the discovery that Gabrielle wants to find her father, who abandoned her and now lives in Mexico, Rambo resumes his concerns that this innocence will be lost, compounded when the girl ends up kidnapped by a cartel. From that point on, however, the script by Stallone and Mike Cirulnick, begins to indulge in a kind of Manichaeism that compromises a sincere immersion in the proposed discourse. With the exception of the young Gabrielle, Maria (Adriana Barraza), and a reporter misplaced in the narrative, played by Paz Vega, all the other characters represent evil embodied. In opposition to a well-constructed fatalism, the elements external to Rambo and his family end up being readily diagnosed as impure by the character - in a conversation - and then repeatedly repeated throughout the work. That the drug cartel is malignant, but with the treatment given to other supporting actors, the representation of evil becomes a caricature, and Rambo, who is no good guy, ends up establishing himself as the most holy of characters, which prevents his lack of control to represent the hopelessness that the work invests on humanity. The film, therefore, does not have the maturity necessary to program such a break without infantilizing it.However, the big problem with this film is, unfortunately, the plot. Not that he is bad, but, particularly, there was a rush to speed up the narrative to reach its great climax, the epic confrontations between hero and antagonists. Of course, no one expects the same narrative weight from Rambo as, say, Wuthering Heights. If you are in the cinema to see John Rambo, then of course you want to see shots, arrows and explosions. Want a practical test? See the trailer embedded in this text: without direct spoilers, you can say that 70% of his scenes correspond to the end of the film. There is so little before that that you can't even build a trailer.Even so, this rush ends up causing problems: the main antagonists - the brothers Victor and Hugo Martinez (Óscar Jaenada and Sergio Peris-Mencheta) - even create a narrative derivation among themselves, like brothers in a growing power struggle for the command of the pack, but this is all played to the side with almost no participation from both in the entire film. Even at the end of the day, when Hugo takes his band - with enough military equipment to face a small army - to Arizona and Rambo's farm, everything seems to serve only the purpose of ""giving Rambo people to kill"". There is no involvement, impact or any kind of action that makes them memorable, even for five minutes.Even a small twist in the second half of the film fails to impress, being positioned in production only as a forgettable cog for Rambo to devise an ""elaborate military plan"" to defend himself against future attackers, just like virtually every film in the series, where the second part of each involved some majoritarian confrontation, a kind of crescendo where history would reach its peak, followed by its resolution. There are loose spots that were abandoned, but they would give a great density to the story if they were used in some way. Given the way the story progresses in Rambo: Until the End, it's pretty obvious that the plot has accelerated too much. Suddenly, an extra 20 or 30 minutes of film would solve that.
Although it is one-dimensional, on the one hand, it substantially lessens the impact of the proposed journey - the portrait of Mexico is harmful enough - the violence promised by the name that the work carries are precisely anticipated. In the emergence of the first, more brutal scene, which does not happen immediately on the tape, there is another twist to Rambo's arc, which shatters in complete disappointment. From the quasi-father concerned about his little girl, the character becomes a killing machine that strips off its human traits to take revenge, but not as a means of purification but rather purposely sadistic. John Rambo does not want to purge his internal violence for some reward, however, to share. There is an underlying depression, therefore, that manages to dramatically move even the segments with the worst possible justifications - Gabrielle's interest in seeing her father does not have much support. The feature, then, records intense segments of carnage - which spectators waiting for the gore will celebrate. The supposed closure of Rambo's trajectory, therefore, seeks to get close to the character's humanity, who apparently died in the wars he participated in. However, in the end, Stallone's pessimism seems to find its apex above anything secondary, while the last drops of blood are spilled. Interesting are the flashbacks of the credits recalling scenes from Rambo in all the films of the franchise. Nostalgic and exciting.",Rambo - Last Blood

115,abisio,A poor farewell for a good franchise,4,23 September 2019,"Stallone is a good writer? Yes, of course; he creates Rocky who becomes one of the longer franchises and even expanded to actual times with CREED already in its second installment. Rambo First Blood spanned three follow ups (impressive considering the character dies in the first book). But now for closure cames Rambo V or Last Blood a poorly written and produced movie.
I am not that surprised considering the disastrous Dark Phoenix. At least this one is more modest in terms of production.The typical story of vengeance after kidnaping a daughter (adopted in this case). There are a few incredible violent and gory action scenes; but iwritting t is too simplistic for its own good.
Secondary characters are caricatures. Only one interesting bad guy; the always reliable Oscar Jaenada that creates the most hideous and scaring villain I saw in a long time. He is incredible realistic; a real bad person; but his dead; the most expected of the movie happens out of camera. It is the only one; the others are quite detailed and bloody.It is surprising that the characters are Mexicah; but actors are mostly from Spain. Aside from Jaenada, there is Paz Vega (doing nothing really) and Sergio Peris-Mencheta (the second bad guy very poorly written).In brief; if you want a few very violent and gory scenes but lots of dead time in between; perhaps it is your movie.

The entire movie had a slow build up, to finally lead to a couple of minutes of Rambo action; why wasnt it spread out into the film better? Taken had a better spread of action compared to this film!

I know that, hell my greatest love is the James Bond franchise!
Rambo is a franchise driven by the actor who plays the central role of John Rambo, Sylvester Stallone.However. After watching I felt it detached from the other films in the franchise.It felt like I had just watched rehashes of other films mainly Taken (2008), Home Alone, even Danny 'The Tunnel King' (The Great Escape, 1963) played by Charles Bronson would have been proud of some tunnel scenes throughout the film.Early in the franchise, the character of Colonel Trautman (played by the late Richard Crenna) had a central role as a kind of father figure to Rambo.
What would he have made of this instalment I still think.Rambo now lives on an Arizona ranch with a romantic interest and their 'adopted' niece.
It is the niece who ends up crossing the border into Mexico in search of her estranged father, being kidnapped and part of a sex trafficking plot in the process. Very Taken.The film has a strong Mexican border element that mirrors scenes of Albanian sex traffickers in Taken.
Another franchise with an aging action hero, Liam Neeson.Stallone is known for input into the dialogue of the screenplay. Rambling or mumbling speeches with a moral Political tone towards the end of Rambo and Rocky films.
I'm sure I heard where did we lose our way or similar. Indeed Mr. Stallone, indeed.The film on it's own merits features scenes of violence towards the end of its short running time of spine inducing gruesomeness that look more at home in The Saw franchise. I'm thinking of bloody, booby-trapped scenes of decapitation.Harking back to the cross-border element of the screenplay. In one scene in particular Rambo drives from Mexican territory back into United States territory over a chicken wire fence of all about five feet.I would rate this film amongst the poorest new releases of 2019.
A sad way to end the franchise, or is it the end?",Rambo - Last Blood

119,kjproulx,Very Distant from the Rest of the Franchise,4,2 October 2019,"The Rambo franchise hasn't been known for its subtleties and that was proven when Sylvestre Stallone returned to the role back in 2008. The amount of violence throughout that film gave action junkies everything they were asking for. It also took the outrageously bloody aspect of the franchise to another level as well. Wrapped up in a nice bow by the time the credits rolled, 2008s Rambo seemed to be the finale. Well, apparently not, as Rambo: Last Blood is now in theatres. Sadly, this franchise definitely should have ended with the previous instalment. Here's why I believe this movie simply doesn't work.Now retired and taking care of a ranch out in the county, John Rambo has evolved into a (seemingly) much calmer man. After his niece makes a poor decision to find out the truth of who her real father has become out in Mexico, all hell breaks loose as John finds himself on the hunt to save his family. Without ruining anything, one thing leads to another and he eventually needs to use his home as a giant war zone/booby-trap to fend off his enemies. In theory, this premise is a great set-up for an action film that simply wants to focus on the action itself, but it really doesn't feel anything like a Rambo movie.Being a war veteran and fending off his enemies throughout the course of his entire life, John Rambo is a character with a lot of complexities. For this reason alone, many of the Rambo films have been able to tell interesting stories, even if the execution wasn't always there. This time around, he has become a family man and an emotional tie is what gets him back in the game. The finale of this movie is the only remotely entertaining aspect, but the set-up for it just felt like an excuse for a revenge movie, which is never truly what the Rambo films have been.Stallone is committed to this character as always and Yvette Monreal as his niece is actually quite good, but their dynamic just felt like it belonged in another movie. With the addition of some very cheesy dialogue at times and the fact that John Rambo is the only one who feels like a real, fleshed-out character, I found myself not really caring about what happened to anyone here. That said, audiences who watch Rambo movies are usually there for the action anyways, and if you're a fan of gory violence that's done well, then the final 20 minutes may be enough for you.In the end, Rambo: Last Blood is a mixture of elements from movies like Taken and Home Alone, with an elderly war hero at the forefront and the violence cranked up to a thousand. There are moments of enjoyment and even a few times where I was having a little fun, but it really is an emotional movie that doesn't feel earned. It asks you to care about characters that haven't been around for much of the franchise and I just couldn't buy it. For die-hard fans of the franchise, maybe check it out once it's available to rent or buy at home, but I really don't think it's worth your time.",Rambo - Last Blood
120,kuarinofu,Wanted to like this but they left me no choice,5,4 December 2019,"Just a quick rundown.First, the starting scene has no reason to be in the film. It was probably shot later to get it to full feature length. I can't think of another reason. It establishes nothing and is not necessary. (It seems that this scene is only in some of the versions of the movie).Second, characters and their motivations are weak. After the story takes a dark turn (which I absolutely enjoyed) John never reflects on his actions and responsibility. Both supporting ladies were merely plot devices and not characters.Third, the acting was uninspired and the performances were phoned in. Sly really lacks his Rambo expressions from Rambo 4 (Rambo 2008). He's dull and not intimidating even when he tries to. And I'm not even talking about First Blood, which was a completely different movie, but Sly actually cared to act and show emotions. Also, evil gang brothers were sort of edgy but still ok for a generic action meat. They were so unimportant we don't even get to see one of them getting decapitated. The less impulsive brother was also very distracting since he kinda looks like a porn actor Manuel Ferrara ;)Fourth, the direction sucked. The movie didn't look good, it had no stylistic value whatsoever. It also had a lot of generic drone footage which was not even color corrected to match the rest of the movie (again, feels very rushed). Accordingly, the pacing was messed up since the movie was super short.Fifth, CGI gore and blood just feels different. It's nice to see some gore but when it's 90% CGI and not practical you just don't get the satisfaction. Even more, you can't savour violent killings of random gang members which have like 10 seconds screen time, you just can't care about them getting killed.And sixth, the most important part of a Rambo movie - the action. It was so incredibly generic and uninteresting (especially in the daylight). Even the home-aloning part, so rushed you can barely see what is going on, the gangsters decided to come all in full gear to get one old man just because the movie has to happen. The revenge scenes had no emotional support from Rambo, especially when he randomly put on the song through the speakers. Just compare this to Rambo (2008) ending action scene, that was INTENSE.I mean, this is a Rambo movie, I'm pretty sure they could've got away with anything they wanted to do, but they didn't do anything interesting besides a darker story which again, I can appreciate.",Rambo - Last Blood
121,Movie-Misfit,Back To The 80's With John Rambo!!,8,5 October 2019,"I wasn't too sure where Stallone was going to go with this one. I had avoided all trailers and spoilers on the film in the lead up to seeing it, so went in completely oblivious to its story.And I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised!I loved his previous outing in Rambo, and that final shot of him arriving on the farm seemed to be an ending to the whole Rambo story. So when this next chapter was announced I was hoping they would keep him out of the jungles and wars for a change of scenery - and that's exactly what we got.Showing us that John has (almost) adapted back into a regular way of life, with hints of his past still hanging over him in the shape of flashbacks, voices in the head, and obsession of tunnel digging - this tired looking, slow moving Rambo spends his life now looking after his horses and family.When his teenage niece decides she wants to go to Mexico to find her real dad and is warned not to - she obviously ignores her uncle John's warnings and heads off. It doesn't take long for her to be kidnapped, drugged and forced into prostitution by 2 nasty brothers. Word soon gets back to Rambo who heads straight to Mexico in a bid to get her back!While most reviews have laughed at the Home Alone aspect of the film, I actually would describe the film as a mix of Taken and Homefront (which ironically was produced by Stallone also). Of course there are moments of 'Home Alone-esque' traps and likeness, but these are quite obviously based on his exploits from his past movies - using traps and techniques as the Vietcong would have done, but in a house setting and his tunnels.The fact that he knows, as an old man, that he can't take on these younger, bad ass mad men - something we learn early on during his first rescue attempt - works perfectly. No longer is he this unstoppable gun-toting action hero, so his planning of a premeditated attack on his home works well giving him somewhat of an advantage when they attack.And attack they do! From all sides.While it may start slow, Rambo: Last Blood quickly picks up the pace and soon you feel you are watching a movie from the 80's which highly entertains! The violence is so outrageous it had me laughing out loud in the cinema, but in the most positive way. This is an amazing chapter in the Rambo universe and as that final scene left me thinking it had all finished with a tidy ending - I heard about a post-credit scene that throws that aside.But hey, I'm not complaining. Go see it!!",Rambo - Last Blood
122,Neptune165,I appreciated the ending credits montage as well,4,5 January 2020,"I'm so sick of the all the Home Alone comparisons. He's a Vietnam veteran and used traps like the Vietcong did in that war. He probably lost many friends to traps like those. Also Rambo is an old man now and him fighting dozens of enemies just wouldn't be believable anymore. The plot is literally the same as Taken. Rambo doesn't even kill people in the original, that was one of the things I really liked about it. The story took a backseat but not significantly for me that I didn't care at all. I still cared about it enough to cheer as he murders people left and right.",Rambo - Last Blood
123,nicholls905-280-546911,Welcome back Rambo,7,29 September 2019,"How do you review a film that is not the same as the US. 89 minutes in the US, 101 minutes here in Australia. That opening scene is essential to the film, but why did they remove it for the US? The bad reviews miss the point of this film and let's be super serious here, if you're new to the Rambo franchise this might seem over the top. Fans will find something here and the violence is for the character's mindset. It is gruesome, but the rage in Rambo is exactly that.",Rambo - Last Blood
124,Dan1863Sickles,Just Like Shakespeare's Richard III!,2,4 September 2020,"Rambo literally has no purpose anymore, because America is not at war anywhere. Fortunately, his reckless, impulsive, childlike teenage step daughter suddenly develops a craving to see Mexico . . . and her long lost father. Because everyone in Mexico is evil, she is immediately kidnapped and forced to become a sex slave, along with dozens of other zombie like females.Rambo is at his best in the melancholy first act, where he keeps mumbling mush-mouthed sentences about how life has become purposeless. ""Now are our bruised arms hung up for monuments,"" he mumbles at one point, indicating a huge knife displayed on the wall of his man cave. ""Now are our stern alarums turned to merry meetings,"" he adds, when his daughter throws a party. The echoes of Shakespeare are obvious, and Stallone's distinctive diction renders each phrase more memorable than ever before. ""Grim visaged war, has, uh, smoothed his wrinkled front. And now, uh! Instead of mounting barbed steeds, to uh, uh, uh, fright the souls of fearful adversaries, he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber, to the lascivious pleasing of a lute."" I just wanted to see Rambo capering nimbly in the Mexican lady's chamber, to the lascivious pleasing of a lute!Now I won't give away the plot, but why couldn't Rambo's step daughter have been a long lost Aztec princess? And why couldn't the men chasing her have been part of an ancient warrior cult hoping to revive the Aztec empire? That would have made the whole story more believable and dramatic.",Rambo - Last Blood
125,qormi,Hardcore,10,2 October 2019,"Stallone's past 70 and bigger and scarier than ever. Great story. Plenty of action, and one of the best Rambo movies. I don't want to give anything away, but you know Rambo... he doesn't hold back on the fury.",Rambo - Last Blood
126,athies,He's gripping the utensils awful tight...,4,14 March 2020,What the hell is this bunker for? Remembering old times.You really think she's not gonna go?This whole thing stinks.Sly has been watching Taken :)Kudos for not giving any slack.Who is this sort of Winona Ryder looking lady?WOW!It's gonna be an action packed final 20 minutes.I hope he runs over it in the dark.FatalityAt least he's got a few new trucks.,Rambo - Last Blood
127,RussHog,Can't wait for Last Blood Part 2,10,23 September 2019,"This film picks up ten years or so after 08 Rambo left off. Rambo is the father figure to a teenage girl. She is kidnapped by sex traffickers in Mexico and Rambo declares war on them to get her back. I found myself completely engaged in this revenge action thriller. The pace is excellent. Solid cinematography. Very good action scenes. Stallone is incredible as Rambo, again he makes him an unstoppable force of nature but also someone who deep inside has a strong sense of justice and a big heart. I found myself rooting for Rambo to get the bad guys and this film did not disappoint. Let's make another!",Rambo - Last Blood
128,MrDHWong,A moderately satisfying send-off to a character Stallone has played so iconically for all these years,7,19 September 2019,"Rambo: Last Blood is the fifth installment of the Rambo franchise starring Sylvester Stallone in the lead role. Directed by Adrian Grunberg , it is a moderately satisfying send-off to a character Stallone has played so iconically for all these years.After returning to the United States from Myanmar, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) has settled down on a farm with his close friend Maria (Adriana Barraza) and her granddaughter Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal). Despite continuing to battle with his inner demons, John enjoys his new life, finding particular solace in bonding with Gabrielle and becoming something of a step-uncle to her. One day, Gabrielle drives to Mexico to look for her birth father, despite John's strong assurance that he is not worth seeking out. When Gabrielle fails to return home, John sets off to search and hunt down those responsible for her disappearance.In spite of a highly predictable plot, Rambo: Last Blood still contains just enough action to entertain long-time fans of the series as well as any potential newcomers. One thing to remember is that the Rambo films weren't popular due to their storylines but instead for the characterisation of John Rambo as a person and the way he deals with his PTSD, that and some good old fashioned shooting up of the bad guys of course. Surprisingly though, there are some nice emotional scenes of drama involving Rambo and his niece, which makes the audience care for her when he is attempting to rescue her. Much like the fourth film, this one contains jarring depictions of graphic violence and gore, however, it is far less frequent this time around but still worth noting. Sylvester Stallone, even in his 70s, still manages to play a convincing action hero, using his brain rather than simply his brawn. Like with Rocky Balboa in Creed II, this was a nice way to draw John Rambo's character arc to a conclusion, as Stallone has gone on to say that this film will be the final time he plays him. Whether or not we will see John Rambo again in the future is anyone's guess but at this point, I am quite happy with what we have gotten so far.I rate it 7/10",Rambo - Last Blood
129,Beejerman,JEER - (4 stars out of 10),4,29 December 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""Rambo: Last Blood"" comes 11 years after the previous 2008 entry into the franchise, ""Rambo"". That film was toted as a bookend to the Rambo series, so I was a little surprised to see this movie come out. Sly has been busy in those 11 years between these Rambo films having done all three Expendable movies, both Creeds, all three Escape Plans, and other works as well. And now he's back once again as the very, noticeably aged John Rambo.This time, he is home on his father's ranch which he is sharing with his old friend, Maria Beltran, and her granddaughter, Gabriela. Not only has he opened his home to them, but his heart as well ... viewing Gabriela as a daughter. When Gabriela's biological father is found south of the border, the temptation is too great and she travels to confront him and find out why he left her - even though both Rambo and Maria sternly warn her against it. In time, Rambo finds out that she has gone missing in Mexico and he straps on his weapons and goes to find her.This entry finds Rambo more angry and embittered than ever. In fact, I had a hard time believing that his character had become so crass and blood thirsty. What Rambo had to do in the past was out of necessity. For survival. For his friend's survival. But in this film, he crosses the line of necessity, to such acts of brutal violence, that it made no sense. I admit the ""home alone"" booby traps he has set up at the end of the movie were cool in parts. However, there were a few parts that were so over-the-top in his personal vendetta that made me believe that Rambo is really no better than his victims are.I did not enjoy this film. It was clearly made just because it could be - not because it should be. I felt the previous film was a fitting ending to the character of Rambo. I no longer like or care for John Rambo anymore. He needs to retire. For good. So sad that I am even having to say that, but there you have it. Only 4 stars out of 10.",Rambo - Last Blood
130,tchitouniaram,Honestly...Shame on creators of this film...,3,10 December 2019,"Honestly...Shame on creators of this film...
Absolutely terrible ending for the iconic Rambo collection..
I thought that part 4 was pretty unimpressive,but to compare to this pile of garbage It was a masterpiece ...
So many stupid things in It!!!Supposedly deadliest and cunning warrior just walks into the beating and destruction of the girl,without proper reconnaissance or at least look around!!!Makes idiotic decisions all the time,just to kill crazy quantity of bad guys in the last 15 minutes... Stupid scenario ,just trying to cash in on the classic!Nasty!",Rambo - Last Blood
131,hotwheelerd-61843,Rambo Last Blood,10,26 June 2021,When this First came out I was like I am not sure about it. Another Rambo FILM REALLY COME ON. But I like the way he ENDED the Life of Rambo it was pretty well done. But that last KILL TAKING THAT MANS HEART OUT OF HIS CHEST LOL. Then throwing it on the Ground it was PRICELESS. AWESOME LAST KILL BECAUSE HE WAS HANGING ON THE FARM WALL PINNED UP WITH BOW N ARROWS A YELLING IN PAIN. Then Rambo DOES THE JOB RIPE. Then walks away can't KILL ANY COOLER THEN THAT. With that Smile on his Face AWESOME.,Rambo - Last Blood
132,saru2020,Cold blooded revenge drama,6,9 February 2020,"A nice revenge drama with so much of cold-blooded violent sequences. Although the climax sequence reminded us of some of the older movies, it still worked and seemed to have been the best part of the whole movie as the other parts of the movie were either sentimental or girl abduction with drug abuse and prostitution.
Nothing else was especially mentionable. But I kinda liked the way the characters showcased their emotions, not sure why but it was a bit different with slow motion and perfectly timed reactions of characters in their situations and was watchable like unusual.",Rambo - Last Blood
133,statuskuo,It's What You Wanted,6,1 December 2019,"A lot has been said about how anti-Mexican this film is. It is. But who cares? Did Rambo care about offending: Russians, Vietnamese, Burmese backwoods police force? Rambo doesn't care about that. Or for that matter, if he knew I was writing a review about his newest (and possibly his last) flick, he'd probably shank me in the throat to kill me like a pig.
That is the point of Rambo. Well, not so much ""First Blood"" because the guy only accidentally killed one guy. Here, it's an entire army. Much like ""John Rambo"", which is super tops in my ""What kind of movie would John Rambo make"" scale. In this, he tackles a Mexican army that is so bothered by Rambo, they need to stop all their endeavors so they can easily cross the border and attack (as the trailer sold us on). Instead, he has settled down in his home state of Arizona where he is raising a niece. From Rambo's sister we never heard about? Nope. His brother's kid? Nope. Who the hell is she? And what does it mean to him. Oh right, they mention he'd been there for 10 years helping raise this child. Well now she's grown up and kidnapped to be sold to the sex market.
I know...""Taken"" correct? Well, hell with you, Rambo was the first to be a badass. So Rambo goes...well...Rambo. And the rest, you should watch to believe. The 1985 version of myself would just leaped into the aisle of the theater screaming how awesome this movie is (by the way, the theater I went to, a few people did), but the 2019 version of me felt less survival man, and more Jason Vorhees. Yes folks, at a certain point in this film, Rambo is essentially a silent stalker killer. And yet, the entire cartel army feels nothing over the fact that they saw their fellow goons: beheaded, spiked, limb chopped, face blown off by shotgun, pitchforked in the gut, hammered in the nuts, and so forth. Rambo is The Predator, and we do get giddy watching him go into ""kill mode.""
But this type of violence in 2019 is frowned upon. Our primal side tells that person to shut up and enjoy. Because not only are we getting a Rambo movie, we get a Denzel movie AND a Liam Neeson movie. Again, it doesn't matter much.
So why the middlin' grade? Because...it isn't the way I wanted him to go out. Rambo does deserve a decent burial. The unfortunate thing about ""The Last Blood"" is that it missed many opportunities. Such as addressing the fact that he is ALWAYS on the wrong side of luck. Violence and crime follow him. Meanwhile most of us most likely wouldn't even experience a shoplifter, Rambo attracts the nastiest monsters on the planet. This would've been great moment of comedy. Instead, this flick gets REAL serious. And then ends abruptly, and somewhat unsatisfied ending that needed something really deep to conclude it. NOT with just going through the Rambo highlights at the end (very 80's. Also, I own the box set).
Look, it is a nice distraction from the PC world. Feels like a breath of fresh air actually that someone was willing to make something so unapologetically un-PC. For that, it deserves some recognition. Stallone deserves his curtain call.",Rambo - Last Blood
134,brett-76260,Rambo: Last on everything,2,22 September 2019,Good grief what was that crap. Trust me this ain't First Blood... I have no idea why this movie was even made. It is so far off the mark on who John Rambo was in the first few movies its pathetic. Ive seen the original probably 200 times and its just sad how far removed from that movie we are now. I wanted to love this movie... I wanted Rambo to live on. But after about 30 minutes I just wanted it to end. Please Stallone do not do another Rambo movie and tarnish it even more. Crikey this was bad...,Rambo - Last Blood
135,Aylmer,Last AND least of the series,5,7 October 2019,"Stallone is back for another Rambo movie in 2019? Seriously, did anyone see this coming? While I ought to be thankful that anything like this can get made, I can't help but feel underwhelmed with how little care here went into what matters most.As a fan of Stallone's and the character's going back to the very beginning, I went into this one without seeing any trailers or reading any reviews lest they sully my impartiality. A few of my friends posted some glowing praise, calling this the gory version of HOME ALONE etc. which bothered me as it made the film sound extremely simplistic. In the end, it's actually even simpler than that due to some heavy abbreviation and and under-baked script.The things I came in wanting to see never happened. We never get to see Stallone reunited with his surviving family as the previous film posed, and it feels extremely unclear with his relationship with the other characters he shares a ranch with. Perhaps that could be cleared up with subtitles as Stallone grunts and slurs his way through many key lines. When his surrogate (?) ""daughter"" (??) gets kidnapped on an ill-advised trip south of the border to trade some passive-aggressive words with her birth-father (???), I found it a little refreshing that the film doesn't shy away from brutality in the slightest. Aside from the lack of any P.C. sensitivity in 2019, there are practically no surprises afterward as Stallone goes on a very Neeson-esque dive into the underworld to find her.This sort of thing would work if we were to get treated to a few tricks he had up his sleeve or a stealthy sneak-in and extraction as seen in RAMBO's 2-4. Does he attempt this? Nope! Stallone just walks right up to the front door of a whore house (after gullibly believing two strangely honest underworld characters) in a move that doesn't make any sense in the script or to the character. He's saved only due to the idiocy of the villains to take ill-advised mercy on him and things just roll from there. When a script relies on characters to make dumb decisions in order to move forward, it's hard to take anything seriously as the film turns into an 80's slasher movie, only with the hero as the invincible killer.Do we at least get some explosions and blood in the end? Well yes, but it's filmed and done with cheap post effects which serve to soften much of the impact. Bad car driving compositing, cartoony blood effects, little enemy characterization, uninspired killings, bad math on how many enemies are left, too much time spent underground, and the lack of any realism or tension really sink things. While I appreciate that the film has an uncompromising tone and Stallone puts in a solid performance, there really isn't much reason to see this film.As much of a surprise is that this film got made, I had really hoped that Stallone's final hanging up of the hat for this role would be a little more dignified. It's a slight step up from your average Van Damme or Lundgren DTV action film these days but that ain't saying much.",Rambo - Last Blood
136,sbweightman,"A formulaic revenge thriller that is watchable, but has little to recommend.",3,2 October 2019,"The story is basic and predictable, the acting (especially from the support cast) is flat and although the action sequence at the end is well done with plenty of explosions and gory violence, it's too little, too late. There's no political commentary, no character depth and no suspense, and the setting is stereotypical to a fault.",Rambo - Last Blood
137,thekingsdom,Great comedy!,5,6 January 2020,"Hehe..This was funny! It's soooooo bad, I was killing myself laughing. There's a bit when the young girl was 'driving' to Mexico in a car that looks like a 1980s studio set shot. The script is erm...the dialogue cardboard and the acting very wooden. Anyway, there's some good death scenes in it and I kind of enjoyed it. 5/10 and good giggle for me so worth a watch.",Rambo - Last Blood

139,The_Light_Triton,Messy,8,4 October 2019,"Everyone who sees a Rambo movie should know what they're getting themselves into. It's going to be a messy, messy trip with blood 'n guts everywhere. And this film doesn't provide that on a discount. You want to watch bad guys die in the most gruesome, messed up ways possible? Here ya go.John Rambo has been living with an adoptive family for 10 years, and spends his time trying to keep his demons from his past at bay. One day, his adoptive daughter decides to go look for her father in Mexico and doesn't return, leading Rambo to go find the only family he's got left, and to bring out the killing machine that lives within him.The initial reviews of this film are more ridiculous than a runway outfit. They say this film promotes a republican's agenda of border security. Well I'm gonna say it out loud, libs - The cartel and a lot of Mexican gangs are exactly as they are portrayed in the films. They have done worse things than what Rambo does to them in the films, because Rambo is about killing his enemies quickly, whereas the cartel wants their victims to suffer and they want to scare anyone from stopping them.This movie isn't meant to push a political agenda. it's meant to send our favorite mentally unstable Vietnam veteran on his way. Sly rocks the role even as an old man and i'm glad he's doing so. As sad as it is to see one of my favorite film series end with the original actor still in the role, It's great to see it end on such a good note.",Rambo - Last Blood
140,jordan2240,Rob Zombie meet Rambo,6,24 September 2019,"Seems to me that a lot was lost on the editing floor, as I felt a lot of story was left out involving some of the minor characters, and these are some of the dumbest bad guys you could hope to find, but each killing is more gory and more entertaining than the previous, so it really is entertaining as a revenge flick. More like 'Taken' than 'Rambo' though.",Rambo - Last Blood
141,Draysan-Jennings,They can't end it like that.,7,26 November 2019,Good movie but I didn't really care for the concept much. It did have some great kill scenes in the end though.

Pretty sad story if you think about it.,Rambo - Last Blood

So humiliating to see John J. like this. Frumpy old Tio John letting kids play in his tunnels of death. Paint him purple and you have...Ok, that's done. On it's own, this is a decent enough film. Girl gets taken, uncle gets revenge. When uncle remembers that he is Rambo, things get nasty. And in this film, gory too! But, the first time uncle goes to Mexico, he apparently doesn't remember that he is Rambo, and he - gasp - gets the tar beaten outta him?!? What the? The second trip, he is Rambo again, and that begs the question, um, what in the world was that first trip about? Why did they do that to this character? No way the 'real' Rambo behaves like that on the first trip. No way.The end is back to Rambo being Rambo, with lots of booby traps and explosions, and the good ol' knife and bow and arrows! And, like horror movie level, blood and guts! And a stupid speech at the end. Will there be a 6th film? If so, please, please, please, make him Rambo from start to finish.",Rambo - Last Blood

and yes...it's a Rambo film...it doesn't play to be a family film. we go to see Rambo type films for action and violence. and of course as films go by they will step it up a notch...if you going into a movie to always find something wrongwith it you will definitely find something but hello it's just for entertainment enjoy it for what it is..it's not like they packaged it with pretty bows and ribbons saying it's a wholesome film... it is what it is action and violence. !! That's what I plan to see !! and also i have been a Rambo fan since primary school i remember seeing Rambo 4 (2008) when it come out of high school itwas R RATED i remember i could not get in. but then when this come out i went in saw it and my first time seeing a Rambo movie in big screen for this last chapter for last blood i am seeing. and it was very fun loved how they brought back all previous Rambo films in this and loved how story stillcontinues and shows Rambo house after 4th Rambo film ended. story still follows Eleven years after the events in Burma from Rambo 4 (2008) , Vietnam War veteran John Rambo inherits his late father's horse ranch in Bowie, Arizona. he lives with his grandmother and he has a Beautiful niece (Yvette Monreal) Gabrielle witch i like her and she is incurable cute with nice eyes i likeher character she plans to go collage, she has few friends they throw party in Rambo basement witch i thought it was pretty funny, i liked tunnels he digging in and what he has in their. after that Gabrielle had a phone call about her father witch she hasn't seen in years that's why grandmother kicked him out years ago. she was keen to go Mexico and she has a demon in her past too, and it's her father that has left her and moved back to Mexico. As with most children that have been abandoned by their paternal parents, she yearns to see her father and ask him the one question that eats her alive. ""Why did you leave my mother and I?"" A question she soon regrets she ever traveled all the way to Mexico to ask her father. In doing so, she has betrayed her families trust, but Rambo loves her and becomes hell bent to save her from the cartels. Rambo and grandmother said NO it's bad idea they both tryed their best to keep her out, but she did a stupid mistake went to Mexico saw her father talked about bad things to her and he didn't care and shut the door like he didn't care anymore, then her cousin decided to go at nightclub she gets taken. Rambo gets pissed off then he goes their search's for her. villains Victor Martinez (Óscar Jaenada) known for losers, The Shallows, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a cartel brother to Hugo Martinez (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) what they do is sex trafficking, short off like Taken version they keeping girls intheir like slaves and beating them up, drugging them putting them into brothels getting raped its like you feel sorry for those girls, that's tough brutal thing i have ever seen and villains aren't that remediable but at least you hate them so BAD like you wanna watch them burn. later on Rambo goes at brothel gets hammer i luv scene he smashes everyone in heads with it with brutal gore, he gets his daughter then scene i didn't like when Gabrielle dies sadly but she didn't deserve to do die, He has invested his last ten years into this young girl and to see what happens to her, (and in real life) but this is a movie it's escapeable the writing can make this movie very unrealistic can at least keep her character alive it can happens to so many human trafficking victims with pull the tears and your heart strings. When you wipe away the tears now the film it's bit drift off bit i mean story says Rambo is their to rescue a girl from Mexico they the director or writers should read and take a good look of their scripts because is it a rescue mission ? or revenge story ? because that's not how story follows it's bloody twist you don't see it coming but at least they could made it like this Rambo niece gets kidnapped then he goes to Mexico, he goes around interrogate everyone, torture everyone make it more like Rambo III mixedtaken mixed with man on fire style, full on action, make it more like Rambo III the all film was in Afghanistan and this film should filmed in Mexico fully getting his daughter story could been in easily like Rambo III like that style he is full on rescue his daughter and happy ending that she is alive i don't see why to kill her off sadly i mean it's scene not fairly very unpleasant scene like breaking bad Jane Krysten Ritter character dies in very bad and ugly scene or assassination games scene where Marija Karan character dies in brutal way. inthis sad scene where his niece dies was very sad makes me cry, it's sad after that I wouldn't have minded a complete film on the relationship building of the people that are in his life. Just sadly she dies but she didn't derisive it i think killing her off is far too easy idea should think a bit more i think because writers have nothing better to write that's why they want to make Rambo have his revenge it should off just been a simple Rambo III mixed with Taken mixed with Commando with man on fire recuse mission style just in Mexico didn't need to drag the showdown and revenge to his home.
the gore, war, blood, brutalest happens and film at showdown kinda like home alone short of thing he sets up all traps at his house witch i liked and it was brutal and fun to watch at tunnels scene as well. Bloody and violent old school action flick you won't see it coming at all. you wipe the tears off your face because you will love to see what he did to cartels at end of movie kinda like Equalizer showdown he takes enemy's one by one but in a better scene to that equalizer movie. Don't listen to the critics if you're a fan of Rambo you'regonna enjoy this a lot. It's not the best in the franchise but still very enjoyable
it keep you edge of your seat until movie ends right in your skin. original this 5th Rambo was going to be Rambo Savage Hunt where Rambo had to find and destroy a genetically engineered monster and was based on a novel called Hunter by James Bryon Hunter and Sly owns the rights for but didn't get green-lit, maybe because it was too similar to Predator but who cares i won't mind if that happened too much like predator give me a break that should been that movie rather then to this. but i was still happy with this movie andhow it turned out it would been a horror savage brutal violence that would been very good and enjoyable horror Rambo film. Stallone just loves keeps coming back successfully, against all odds. Who would have thought that he could pull off another Rambo flick at age 73? Well, I'm glad he did, becausebesides Liam Neeson, Denzel Washington, Mel Gibson, Keanu Reeves who are we gonna turn to for some old school, old-man-on-a-revenge-spree flick? and the story doesn't know witch is it going to be revenge story like Death Wish mixed with old man Punisher or a rescue mission like Schwarzenegger's Commando mixed Rambo III mixed Man on fire with Taken Rescue missionstyle. i wished their could been better things like they didn't need to kill his niece character off i would have liked to see him rescuing her and have a happy ending together just like ending of Death Wish 2018 remake ending, I wouldn't have minded a ending trilogy complete film on the relationship building of the people that are in his life. Just John on the farm with his family. RaisingGabrielle and seeing her grow into a young lady that will soon be off to college. Rambo is very proud her witch you can see great chemistry together

144,SkullScreamerReturns,In his mind the war never ended...and now he's angrier than ever,6,22 September 2020,"The fifth film in the Rambo series starts like a drama and at first feels a bit distant to the franchise. But when the going gets tough the Rambo gets going. Similarly to the fourth installment, this one too is very serious and even pessimistic in tone, and the violence is...very violent. Don't expect an easygoing feel-good movie because it's quite somber and nasty. But if you're a fan of hard edged revenge stories, oh boy...this is it.At first I thought this is an unnecessary sequel after the great fourth film, but then it finally wrapped up pretty good. Even though it's not set in actual war zone this time, the story still illustrates the Rambo character just like we know him. He just wants to live a peaceful life but when things go wrong he turns into a killing machine. Some have argued that he's even too aggressive in this film but that's just because he has a personal vendetta, and I think all his rage and trauma he tries to keep inside just explodes as he puts everything in his possibly last battle.The action scenes are good but not the best possible. It looked like the budget for the filming locations and sets has been quite limited. Other than that I didn't find much to complain. Maybe if you are obsessed with jungle, then you might get disappointed, but this is Rambo in a different setting and I think it's interesting to see this too.Even though this film is a bit different entry in the Rambo series it's not bad at all. I like especially Stallone's acting because I think he's became a better actor in his later career and he can put more depth into the Rambo character nowadays. Recommended for vigilante type action movies and Stallone fans.",Rambo - Last Blood

147,akcenat,A generic revenge thriller with an unusually grisly edge,4,15 December 2019,"""Rambo: Last Blood"" is basically ""Taken 1"" meets ""Home Alone"" filled with the dumb dialogue. Unfortunately, Rambo becoming more of a caricature with each increasingly silly sequel, deserved to stays retired, for good.
""First Blood"" was such a great film with a simple story of a war veteran that struggled to return to civilization, constantly looking for a place to redeem himself for his actions, while ""Last Blood"" is boring film that is sad conclusion of a franchise. The main problems with movie are numerous, but the root of it all lies with the poorly written script which makes no effort to infuse this story with the same level of depth and social awareness that all previous installments did. One gets the sense that several undeveloped scripts were cut & pasted to create this one - and with the knowledge that ""Homefront"" starring Jason Statham was originally written as Rambo 5 - its clear that there's a patchwork of creative influences at play. Basically, anyone walking into see some Hoo-rah Rambo action might want to adjust their expectations, because it is such a bad/stupid/boring movie that is dismal and pointless endeavor. Only person who will benefit from it is Stallone and his increased bank account. Bravo old man.Rating: 4-",Rambo - Last Blood
148,stevenrotherforth,Stallone has given his fans what they want. Thank you Sir!,7,26 September 2019,"Rambo: Last BloodAt the end of Rambo's last instalment the Vietnam Vet went home finally bringing his story full circle.
With that we said our goodbyes just as we did with Rocky in his supposedly last instalment 2006's 'Rocky Balboa' only to see him return again in the excellent 'Creed' and 'Creed 2'.
Guess what? Good old Sly has dusted off the survival knife and bow to allow his weary war machine to draw some more blood.
A couple of years back in this movies early development stages 'Last Blood' was on and off more than a celebrity wedding.
With Stallone saying he was done with the character.
Thankfully he had a change of heart.
'Rambo: Last Blood' is here.
Stallone is one shrewd guy. He knows what his audience wants and while he still can he's gonna give it to them.
Those who aren't fans of the franchise will sneer and mock the movies lack of political correctness and stereotypical views.
The Snowflakes of this world will cry out that this film is way too violent.
Toxic Masculinity is a phrase I've heard thrown around to describe this movie.
Sounds like a cheap brand of shower gel to me.For the fans however. We just want to see our hero pile up the corpses in ever increasing inventive ways.
Think of 'Last Blood' as a cross between 'Taken' and 'Home alone'.
This supposedly last instalment ( yeah right ;) sees John J living the quiet life on his family's ranch.
All is well until his niece decides she wants to go into Mexico to find her real father.
When she goes missing it's up to Rambo to unearth those particular set of skills and exact revenge on the wrong doers.
Rambo: Last Blood does indeed play out like a ultra violent remake of 'Home alone' with Rambo setting up booby traps all around his property to kill the intruders in some rather gruesome but highly entertaining ways.
This film is probably not for the soft skinned millennials who will complain that Rambo is a mean and nasty Mr.
That said the violence is earned. He does very bad things to very bad people.
If you are a fan of the franchise then you're in for a good time.
If however you had booked to see 'Downton Abbey' and accidentally sat in the wrong screen room.
Then you're going to have a heart attack.
When the third act kicks into gear it's twenty minutes of pure carnage.
I thoroughly enjoyed 'Last Blood '. It sits somewhere in the middle in terms of being the best in the franchise.
""First Blood"" being the ultimate classic followed by the fourth instalment.At 89 minutes 'Last Blood' is paced moderately until the finale.
Stallone's performance is universally recognised as being the stand out attribute. He gives a heartfelt performance here. There's a rather touching seen midway which will bring a tear to the eye.
You see it's not all macho!So to sum up. If this is to be the last then I'm fine with that.
But should Stallone decide to do more then I'd welcome another.",Rambo - Last Blood

153,buccaneer21,Stallone Ruined The Rambo Franchise With Last Blood,1,25 September 2019,"Let us review on how the Rambo franchise went through the first four films. The first film -""First Blood"" - was a great opening as we get to meet John Rambo,a Vietnam War veteran who apparently is suffering from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) brought about by his war experiences that he gets an unfriendly welcome in the country that he served. The second film -""Rambo:First Blood Part II"" was a good sequel as it explains Rambo's war expertise and a movie that provided a morale victory to the viewer particularly Americans as it presents Rambo becoming successful in a reconnaissance mission of rescuing prisoners of war at Vietnam. The third film - ""Rambo III"" - provided another reconnaissance mission for Rambo in aiding the Afghan rebels against the Soviet Union which also served as a personal mission to rescue his military superior,Colonel Trautman. The fourth film -""Rambo"" was a great film as we get to see John Rambo just wanting to live the rest of his life in Burma until he meets Christian evangelists that he rescued gave him hope and optimism in life. The ending of seeing him get back to Arizona was a great closure. I felt that Sylvester Stallone should have ended the Rambo film franchise at this point .But then,""Rambo:The Last Blood"" appeared. The released of the fifth Rambo ruined the franchise and it just provided a poor send off to John Rambo. What made this film falter?First,the film is apparently far from the first four films. In it,we see John Rambo living with a surrogate family particularly a daughter that wasn't given any explanation at all. This part of the story was underwritten particularly on why he particularly have great love and affection for a surrogate daughter.In addition to that,we don't see Rambo as a soldier nor a guy who is bothered by his PTSD. Instead,we simply see him in his geriatric age whom we barely remember by his war exploits. The only thing that movie did was to provide flashbacks from previous films. With these characteristics, the typical Rambo fan won't view this as a continuation of the fourth film. It was more of a revenge drama rather a soldier on a mission or a military veteran who is traumatized by his war experiences.The poor screenplay was also a big part of it.The plots involved have been taken from other movies particularly ""Taken"". One who is a fan of the Taken trilogy would identify Bryan Mills and the viewer would be reminded of Liam Neeson's character rather than Stallone's John Rambo himself. Not only that. We also get to witness other points of the story that was inspired by ""Home Alone"" particularly with the military weapons that Rambo has on his house when he dealt with the Mexican cartel members. Rambo author David Morrell also stated that it was the same as the 70's B-movie ""Trackdown"". Based on the IMDB facts on ""Trackdown"", we also see rancher (Rambo is now a rancher in Arizona) who go after a gang (Rambo went after the Mexican cartel) to rescue his sister got abducted for sex traffickers. (Rambo must rescue his surrogate daughter got abducted for sex trafficking as well).As for the other features of the film, this one is definitely rushed and the story basically was so simplistic.One could also feel that the main character is not John Rambo at all and it would be difficult to relate this movie from the other films of the Rambo franchise.Too bad that the film tried to squeeze more money into the franchise. It could earn money but it was a poor send off and it definitely ruined Rambo's legacy instead. Now,we get to see the poorest film of the Rambo franchise.",Rambo - Last Blood
154,maria2023,Time To Give Rambo A Rest,2,20 September 2019,"When Sylvester Stallone did ""Rambo"" and it was released back in 2008, I felt that it was a great ending to the film franchise. Then,I was surprised that another film was made and released in 2019 in addition to the franchise entitled,""Rambo: Last Blood"". There is only one thing that I could say about this film. It was a disaster.As I have stated previously, it was a disaster. The film features John Rambo on his retirement living in peace at Arizona. Added to that,we also get to see him go against a Mexican cartel that kidnapped her friend's daughter and goes after them in the Mexican border in order to rescue her. When the daughter got killed, we get to see Rambo explode and become once again a one-man army that killed the members of the Mexican cartel.Too bad that this film looks out of place among the other movies in the film franchise. First,the plot has John Rambo dealing with a cartel instead of military personnel unlike in the other films. Second of all,we get to see him never recover from the psychological problems that we are introduced with especially in the first film of the franchise,""First Blood"". In other words,the character still acts the same since the first film. Added to that,it becomes more of a revenge drama rather than a military person on a mission like ""Rambo II"",""Rambo III"" and ""Rambo"" nor was it about a military person who is affected by psychological effects after serving in Vietnam in ""First Blood"". In short, Rambo becomes entirely a new character in it and he looks like a different character in it. Finally,there is less action in it unlike the other films as the violence in it becomes subdued by Rambo film franchise standards.Just like what a reviewer said, Stallone tried to make Rambo relevant for today's audience. But the movie was unable to deliver. Since it didn't, it is time to give Rambo a rest.",Rambo - Last Blood
155,Magow-Intermean,Rambo: Last Blood Review,7,4 October 2019,"When his niece (Yvette Monreal) goes missing in Mexico looking for her AWOL father, ex-Vietnam vet John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) goes south of the border to rescue her, getting drawn into the ugly world of sex trafficking.
An end credits montage of old Rambo movies at the end of Rambo: Last Blood is a sad reminder of how far Sylvester Stallone's secondary franchise (after Rocky) has devolved. Ever since Ted Kotcheff's gritty and gripping First Blood, the Vietnam vet has taken an inexorable slide to the cartoon-y and the irrelevant. The latest, and seemingly the last, is now on a par with his Escape Plan franchise, a sad end for one of cinema's most engaging anti-heroes.
The film gets off to a sluggish start with Rambo in a rocking chair, living out his retirement on an Arizona farm in scenes striving hard to reach the soulful qualities of Logan - we see him (impressively) riding horses, popping pills and making a letter opener for his niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal) before she goes off to college. Yet even this scene-setting stuff feels like join-the-dots: Gabrielle throws a party that is only designed to let us know that Rambo has built survivalist tunnels like he did in his old 'Nam days that will certainly come into play in the last reel.
The plot kicks in when Gabrielle travels to Mexico to make contact with her absent father and ends up being inducted as a sex slave by a drug cartel run by brothers Victor (Óscar Jaenada) and Hugo (Sergio Peris-Mencheta), surely a joke for the Les Misérables crowd. Of course, Rambo comes looking for Gabrielle, turning detective by intimidating minions for info, then going full Travis Bickle by taking a hammer to the denizens of a brothel.By this stage, Rambo: Last Blood is riddled with narrative flab, risible speechifying, wild plot conveniences (Paz Vega plays a journalist whose One Job is to keep Rambo on the right track with the investigation), routine action filmmaking (everything is hammered home by Brian Tyler's wall-to-wall score) and a caricatured, xenophobic attitude to Mexicans (it feels like a film designed for the Trump heartland). There's throwback fun to be had as Rambo lures the goons back to his booby-trapped farmhouse coming on like an 18-certificate Home Alone, but by this time you barely care.Perhaps the saddest thing is Stallone himself, so charming in Ryan Coogler's Creed, but unable to imbue Rambo with anything approaching humanity - the character often talks about ""trying to keep a lid"" on his dark side yet there's no sense of a man actually wrestling with his demons. With a film entitled Last Blood, you hope - for Stallone's, the audience's and cinema's sake - it delivers on the promise

158,colewaters,Sylvester Stallone does it once again,10,22 September 2019,Sylvester Stallone does it once again as John Rambo. This is the best action film of the year. It is by far Sylvester Stallone's best movie,Rambo - Last Blood
159,dvc5159,Grim but solid final outing for ol' John J.,7,18 September 2019,"First off, try to avoid the trailers if you have not seen them already - especially the recent red band trailer. Just a heads up.Sylvester Stallone returns as the iconic one-man-army John Rambo - older and somewhat creakier but still the reluctantly brutal killing machine when pushed.When we last saw him, he effectively made tomato paste out of a brutal Burmese regime and returned to his family ranch in Bowie, Arizona. Eleven years have passed since then and John J. now tends to his horses and his adoptive family, including caretaker Maria (Adriana Barraza, ""Babel"") and niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal). Gabrielle naively ventures to Mexico to find her birth father, resulting in her getting kidnapped by the Martinez cartel led by brothers Hugo (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) and Victor (Oscar Jaenada, ""The Losers""). This springs Rambo into action once again, whose struggle to cope with his violent past is affecting his health.The Rambo franchise has been four-for-four for me, with ""First Blood"" being one of the best Hollywood action films ever made, and its best sequel ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" continuing that momentum albeit sacrificing some of the human elements of the first for bigger-scaled action. III and IV are both skilfully-made action films that still give most modern action films that aren't named ""The Raid"", ""John Wick"" or ""Sicario"" a run for their money.""Last Blood"" is intended to be Rambo's final adventure and its another good, rock-solid entry in a storied series. It's also easily the darkest film in the entire franchise, going to thematic areas that wouldn't be out of place in a Sam Peckinpah film. I didn't bring up ""Sicario"" by accident"" - think ol' Sam doing Liam Neeson's ""Taken"" but with Sly's Rambo instead and you'll get the idea.Some may be turned off by the grim tone but I appreciate the risks director Adrian Grunberg (""Get the Gringo"") took with bringing such a low-key and intentionally dour entry in a major action franchise whose name is recognised globally.Rest assured, this is still a Rambo film, and all of his rage gets and torment gets built up towards the Grand Guignol carnage (spoiled heavily in all trailers) that ends the film. While it doesn't have as high of a body count compared to the previous three entries (especially the fourth one, Good God was that bloody), nobody who is unfamiliar with Rambo's methods will be surprised at the level of soul-grinding brutality that he dishes out, making John Wick's kills seem like a pleasant day in the park by comparison.This is Stallone's character arguably moreso than David Morrell's, and he brings the character to the only logical conclusion, considering the previous entries. It's also great to see Rambo display the most emotions he's felt since ""First Blood"", grounding the character and raising the stakes even more. The rest of the supporting cast does a fine job - though I wish Paz Vega (""Spanglish"") was given more to do. Standouts go to Oscar nominee Barraza and Peris-Mencheta for turning what could have been two dimensional roles into something a bit more thoughtful. Just a bit.With the name ""Rambo"", one would expect another typical shoot-em-up plot, and this film is just that, but writers Stallone and Matthew Cirulnick and director Grunberg keeps things lean and mean at a brisk 89 minutes with sufficient emotional heft. A minor gripe that I have is that ""Rambo IV"" has a much better conclusion/retirement for the character than this one - considering the amount of crap he went through in all of the films - but to suggest more from my end would be to spoil the film. All in all it's still a satisfying closing chapter to Rambo's saga, flaws and all.There's a lot of subtle emotional touches too that make this entry stand out as an entirely different beast from the rest of the franchise, yet its plentiful violence at the film's final third immortalizes what fans pay their tickets for - to see a ruthless killing machine that's the best at knives and guns, as the late Samuel Trautman/Richard Crenna once phrased.",Rambo - Last Blood
160,DeBBss,A Decent Homage to a Legendary Character,4,25 October 2020,"Rambo reminds me of the terminator franchise, started off strong with the first three, then it got ruined by pointless sequels. And I think this is the last Rambo movie, and I know it says Rambo: Last Blood, but you never know with cinema nowadays. In all honesty, Rambo could've ended a lot worse, I think that this movie is completely acceptable in terms of it being a sequel.In this installment of Rambo, it takes things a lot more different. Instead of Rambo fighting an entire militia, Rambo goes against the ""Cartel"". Rambo: Last Blood is also a lot more grounded than the last movie, which I do appreciate. But different doesn't necessarily mean good; the plot wasn't all that impressive in my opinion. The plot was very average with the revenge aspect that's in pretty much every Rambo movie. I can't really put my finger on it, but something felt strange for me during the runtime.Rambo is a very well known character in pop culture and pretty much everywhere, and this supposedly being the finale, I can now look back at it, and respect it. Rambo: Last Blood tries to give John Rambo a homage, and I think it overall did a good job. It could've pulled a Dark Fate and completely disrespect the franchise, so it could've been a lot worse. Lastly, Rambo: Last Blood is very enjoyable, it knows how to entertain, and it does exactly that.

First of all I suspect that Stallone has suffered a stroke, because he's slurring more than ever. Even when he's speaking what I assume is English, it's at times almost impossible to hear what he says. Secondly, a third or so of the dialogue is in Spanish, a language I don't speak. But it's amazing how much Mexican slang one has picked up from watching Blood In Blood Out probably more than a dozen times. And in all fairness, what the bad guys are saying is most likely of little importance. Since all the Mexicans are acting like they're in a telenovela, you don't have to be a genius to figure out what's happening on screen.The last 10-15 minutes of the movie is the reason you're watching the movie.I don't know whether to blame the director, cinematographer or the editor, but the geography in the fight scenes is, shall we say, muddled.Oh, and remember when Stallone was an Academy Award nominated screenwriter?

Stallone doesn't really seem into the movie, his niece was an idiot and not sympathetic at all and the idiot plot was abused like crazy. Whether it was cartel bosses who spare lives of people who cross them and enslave American girls knowing what sort of trouble that would bring. I would have to imagine a ransom would have been far more lucrative for her return to begin with.I really liked Rambo 4 and felt like it was a solid ending for the series. There was just no need to continue it. It's almost like you just want to pretend this movie never happened.The movie is very, VERY light on action, which leads me to conclude that Stallone just wasn't capable of pulling his weight in action scenes. This was already evident in Rambo 4 when the mercs were basically used to carry out most of the grunt work while Stallone ran around in the background.I'm probably just going to pretend this movie never happened. It's for the best. I know some people are getting political about this movie, but at no point did it ever do that. It felt like a TV movie at times and it's a shame. I feel like there were many scenes cut. If they could find Rambo's ranch, I'm sure they had found out who he was and realized they needed a lot more muscle.",Rambo - Last Blood
165,flicklover,Why Sly? Why?,5,21 September 2019,"In 2008 when the 4th Rambo came out i thought it would be a joke. It turned out to be a really solid Rambo film and also a great ending to the John Rambo story. But no, commerce called again and Last Blood comes out. I was wary when i read what the story was about but i would give it a chance. I grew up loving the Rambo character. Sylvester Stallone had done such a good job ending the story that I thought that Last Blood wouldn't measure up. It doesn't as a Rambo film. Last Blood just feels like Taken with John Rambo in it.The film feels more like a more violent version of Taken. Rambo is now at home living quietly. He has an adoptive niece who he cares very much that goes into.Mexico and is tricked into prostitution. Rambo goes after her and you can imagine what happens. The truth is that even though the film is engaging it just doesnt feel.like a Rambo film. Again, it is more Rambo does Taken. Giving the character someone to.care about is fine but the setting just didn't feel right. Sylvester Stallone is ok in the role, having more dialogue in this film than in any of the others. But I just kept thinking it was not working as a Rambo film. The action is very over the top, even more than the previous installment. I understand that Sylvester Stallone is in his 70's and he can't do the long hair with the headband thing anymore. It is a revenge film, but it doesn't fit for the character, and frankly this story has been done much better before. The last Rambo film was very violent, but engrossing and the tone was right. This film turns into a flat out horror movie in the last 20 minutes. With violence so over the top that it was funny. I don't get who Sylvester Stallone went with this as the way to say goodbye to Rambo. I get that he might have wanted to go in a new direction with Last Blood but it just didn't work.Very disappointed!Grade: C-",Rambo - Last Blood

167,Rendanlovell,Was there a script?,2,5 May 2020,"This movie is ruff (there's no dog in this nor is it about a dog so idk why I spelled it like this). There are parts when it enters into hilariously bad territories. There's a moment when the lead girl Gabriela goes to talk to her father that is seriously hysterical. Her father is playing it so completely over the top maniacal and the dialogue is horribly on the nose. It made me laugh harder then I've laughed in most comedies. Everything about this is terrible. It looks like visual slop for one. Most of the movie is disgustingly color graded. It somehow looks under saturated and overly colorful at points. Most of the film is bathed in this puke color yellow. Not one person cared about how this was presented. There's horrible looking green screen (almost always when characters are driving), anytime a scene takes place in a dark environment the grain pops WAY up, and its constantly cutting to a new bizarre angle every five seconds. It's literally visual vomit. The crown jewel of this movie's awfulness is the script though. The story actually makes no sense. The whole thing is set off by a character making a decision that has no motivation behind it at all. Then when Rambo goes to save her, she somehow dies on the drive home. So even though this character, who was the reason this story was set off in the first place, is now dead, Rambo prepares booby traps at his house so that he can bait the villains into coming to his house? Why was the script written like this? Instead of having this R rated Home Alone conclusion, why not have the whole story be about him trying to save this girl? We could see him learning guard patterns, building up his arsenal, and then finally executing his plan. But no, instead he runs in with a hammer, kills some dudes, and leaves with the girl with little no hiccups. Only for the girl to die so that he can have motivation to then bait the mafia into coming across the border to get him. What on earth?? Continuing with the script issues, every line of dialogue is so painfully on the nose. People are constantly saying either exactly what's happening or explaining exactly what they are doing. Some of it, again, is so terrible it borders on being comparable to the The Room. I've never seen another Rambo movie so maybe I'm just missing something but there's also a lack of motivation for the characters. Why does Gabriela want to find her dad so bad? I don't know. What reason would she have to go to Mexico, unaccompanied to find a father everyone around her hates? The only reasonable answer is because a story had to happen. If you were to tell me this movie was made by putting Rambo into the same computer algorithm that made Taken 2 or 3, with a side of generic soft reboot I'd believe you. Everything about it is that bad or bland. The music sounds royalty free, the acting isn't the best, characters pop in and out when it's convenient, and the story is so boring/predictable it becomes numbing. Not one person seemed to care in the slightest on this. Theres even a moment when Rambo pulls his truck over on the right side of the road. Then, in the next cut, the truck is inexplicably being pulled over across the road to the left side. Wat. The only redeeming qualites is the actual character of Rambo. Stallone has never been a great actor but this character is sort of compelling. He's kind of psychotic. Digging pointless tunnels for no reason, having crazy flashbacks, ripping peoples bones out of their bodies, and downing cocktails of drugs. I like how tortured he is. Other then that, the only other thing that nears positive is the violence. Which can get quite gruesome at points. The home alone ending especially gets pretty graphic. The practical stuff looks good for the most part but any visual effects are absolutely dreadful. Overall, it's just the worst. If you were to pull out the character of Rambo and throw in Liam Neeson, this would actually just be another Taken movie with home alone traps near the end.",Rambo - Last Blood
168,movieman6-413-929510,"The new Rambo film is a bit exaggerated, but entertaining.",6,20 September 2019,"Rambo: Last Blood is the latest film from the Rambo film series. This film is directed by Adrian Grunberg, the director of How I Spent My Summer Vacation.In the film, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) retired to his Texas ranch to spend his older days in peace. His niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal) tries to meet her father for the first time in Mexico, but here she ends up in the hands of a Mexican drug cartel, who engage in drugs and trafficking in women.
When Rambo hears this, he decides to pick up his weapons and skills to save Gabrielle before she disappears into this dark criminal world.This new Rambo film is a bit different compared to the previous Rambo films. In the earlier Rambo films, Rambo fought against corrupt military groups, but in this new film he fights against a drug cartel. The old trauma aspects of Rambo and the Vietnamese war veteran, for example, appear unnecessary in this film.
Because of the different kind of story of this film, the film comes across as a mature mix of the films Taken and Home Alone, where an uncle tries to rescue his niece from criminals and tries to defeat these criminals with booby traps. The film is a bit exaggerated, but it is entertaining. For an action movie with a better story, you better stick to the first two Rambo films.Sylvester Stallone still delivers appropriate acting work like an older Rambo. He did say that this will be the last Rambo film if this film is not successfully received.
The rest of the cast does, however, provide less acting. Yvette Monreal seems a bit uncertain in this film with her acting work. She has also acted more in unknown film and TV series. This is the first major film in which she acts and this can be seen. Paz Vega plays a journalist in the film, but she doesn't do anything special about the role. The cast members who play the criminals sometimes look a bit exaggerated as characters from a cartoon.",Rambo - Last Blood

171,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,"Bloody still Rated - R bad-ass Rambo action packed sequel, for a Stallone / Rambo fan I love it",9,29 October 2019,"I went to see this movie last night with my friend with an open mind, open eyes and honestly this movie really surprised me. Rambo: Last Blood is the fifth and perhaps final installment in the John Rambo film saga. I am number 1 Stallone and Rambo fan for life! Rambo movies are my favorite action movies of all time, I have fun watching them. Stallone really surprised me, I wasn't disappointed. Sylvester Stallone is still in his best shape and in this movie he is one man army! That's what I wanted! It is not an war action movie so what? It is bloody, Rated-R, it is gory, adrenalin, rush action movie with action scenes and action stunts are really well done.John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) for 73 year old man is still a killing machine. Adrian Grunberg directed beautiful this movie sequel I love and Stallone beautiful wrote the script I loved it. I don't understand why this movie get's hate? Why is it accused it is racist? I am so sick to my stomach that morons like haters and movie critics are trashing Rambo III because it is in Afghanistan and Rambo helps Mujahideen and in Rambo: Last Blood: Rambo fights against Mexican cartel and human trafficking. It is different not for everyone and they get crap on it! Why those two movies get crap on it? Rambo III and Rambo: Last Blood? just why they got crap on it? I am sick and tired. David Morrell the autor of First Blood the first Rambo movie is ashamed of this movie. I disagree with Morrell I have enjoy this film every minute.In the opening scene we have Rambo on a horse rescuing a family but he only saves a teen girl from a storm and the girl's parents dies. Rambo couldn't save them. John Rambo, the former Green Beret now retired and living on his father's ranch. When his niece who is like a daughter to him Gabriela (Yvette Monreal) travels to Mexico to visit her friend Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda) to find out why her father abandoned her and her dying mother. She disappears and she is been sold to human trafficking. When Rambo find's out he travels back to Mexico to find the girl, brutal human trafficking cartel drew First Blood, he will drew their Last Blood.Rambo: Last Blood is still a bad-ass action film, Rambo is still rescuing people. He's still trying to help people. Rambo still sets booby traps on his ranch and in the tunels. He still uses bow and arrow on bad guys. He uses knives, slash people's heads off, throws knives in people. Stabs people with a tool fork. I wish we would have C4 tip arrows in this movie, but sadly they werent like they were in Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rambo III. This movie isn't like Taken (2008), it has a different twist on it. In Taken Liam Neeson's daughter survives in this movie Rambo's niece dies. Rambo gets angry and he starts a war. Remember in Rambo: First Blood Part II Agent Co Bao (Julia Nickson) gets shot and killed by VC commander Lieutenant Tay (George Cheung) and Rambo gets mad and prepares him self for a war of his life. In this movie he does the same on a more bloody brutal way. He prepers him self against an army of thugs Human Traficking rigs, Sets booby traps and kills every mother***** of them. That's what we got that's what I enjoy this movie so much. The movie perfectly end it, Rambo is still alive, I enjoy Brian Tyler's score he made a score on Rambo (2008) and he made ascore for this movie. I enoy the music tune for Rambo next movie good music score by Brian Tyler.If I rank Rambo movies they would be: Rambo: First Blood Part II is my number one favorite movie, second rank is Rambo III I have soft spot for my movie, third Rambo (2008), fourth spot is First Blood and Rambo: Last Blood is sadly last fifth film. I enjoy this film more than First Blood but that is just me. It is not better than John Wick Chapter 3 and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw but it still a fun entertaining bloody Rated-R action packed movie. Rambo still has knives, bow and arrow. Hugo Martinez (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) is still a good villain. I love ene man army movies in action movies. Why Arnold Schwarzenegger can't make action movies nowday like Sly does? This Rambo is still old school action hero like Schwarzenegger was in the 80's Commando. Why Schwarzenegger can't make action movies like is Rambo: Last Blood and John Wick Chapter 3?Some moron on YouTube said A Good Day to Die Hard is better than this movie? I say hell NO! The fifth Die Hard is garbage!! I hate that film. Sylvester Stallone is awesome and decent in his acting performance. This is my movie, those are my kind of action movies. Steven Seagal made two movies about human trafficking Belly of the Beast (2003) and Out of Reach (2004) I liked that movie I don't care what anyone says. Dolph Lundgren made a movie about human trafficking in Skin Trade (2014) and Liam Neeson made a movie about human trafficking in Taken (2008) they got pass so why not this Rambo sequel? Jean-Claude Van Damme which I also admire and love to death made a movie about human trafficking too 6 Bullets (2012). I am glad that Sly made a movie about human trafficking in Mexico. So what it is not like First Blood, this movie was never suppose to be taken serious.I will definitely buy this movie on DVD and Blu-ray disc, if it get's in to my store. I collect Rambo movies and I collect Stallone movies. Next week I am planing to pick up Creed II (2018) on 4K Blu-ray disc for the Stallone collection. I hate it that film I rant it in March because Rocky to me was wasted. He did do nothing for me and because he copied Mr. Miyagi from The Karate Kid Part III. But I am going to give Creed II a second chance because I like Dragos and Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago in Creed II was fantastic and still excellent as Ivan Drago. I love all five Rambo movies I am number 1 Stallone / Rambo fan for life.Rambo: Last Blood is a solid action movie I love to death. It is different from the last four movies but still an action packed Rambo sequel. It was my first Rambo movie I ever saw in the movie teater I have enjoy it last night. The movie is fast paced, goes quickly around. I only wish it would have more action. I recommend it to all action junkies and Rambo fans out there.",Rambo - Last Blood
172,dasa108,Good one!,8,14 June 2021,"There are iconic characters in the cinema. Rambo is one of them. Here we have him already in his third age, carrying a heavy backpack of trauma and pain. He lives in a place where he has a family whose existence was unknown in all the previous movies. So from the first moment we see a teenager who is curious to know why her father abandoned her. If your father is Mexican, it is better not to find an answer to this question. From the first frame we know that she is going to die and that the catalyst for the whole plot will be Rambo's revenge. After verifying that all Mexicans are evil and that to be a villain from that Latin country it is better to find Spanish actors, we can conclude one thing: even Stallone when the time comes is carried away by fashion and speaks Spanish. His niece is kidnapped, prostituted, tortured and drugged - in that order. She dies in the arms of her uncle. Then the plate is served for a massacre. Mexicans are not enough when it comes to a tremendous finale where the rhythm and blood are exuberant. The movie is excellent and it gives you exactly what you want. When we see Rambo we don't want to see Mamma Mia: we want the wicked shattered and Rambo blowing everything up in the air (or under the ground in this movie). Very good movie.",Rambo - Last Blood
173,WalkdenEntertainment,Stallone still has plenty of fuel in the tank!,7,19 September 2019,"Continuing on from where we last left Rambo with the fourth instalment in 2008, Rambo's past still haunts him, creating a ""War within his own mind"". While trying to seek peace Rambo is now living the farm life with a house keeper and her daughter. Needless to say, it isn't long until John Rambo is forced once again to use his combat and survival skills to dish out a bloody revenge one more time. Here our leading actor, Sylvester Stallone (who is 73 years old in real life) brings the action and popcorn entertainment successfully once again.I personally have always found pure enjoyment whenever I watch a Rambo film. This is for sure because of the action factor, but I also generally care about this character. Naturally the 1st Rambo film is truly my all time favourite out of the previous 4 instalments.For fun, here is the on screen body count for the previous Rambo films:
* First Blood (1982) ➖ 1 Kill
* Rambo First Blood Part 2 (1985) ➖ 69 Kills
* Rambo III (1988) ➖ 132 Kills
* Rambo (2008) ➖ 236 KillsWithout giving away spoilers, Rambo: Last Blood definitely feels like the film decided to focus more deeply on Rambo's character and go back to what worked best within the series: Revenge. I personally enjoyed this concept more than just another film trying to out do the body count from the previous film. That being said...While the body count might be lower, there is still plenty of kills and I will advise that this Rambo film contain the MOST gore and blood and easily warrants the film's R18+ rating.As for the plot, I really enjoyed the extension of John Rambo's character. Within the runtime, the film does well in providing a setup, generally getting right into it.The plot here is slightly predictable at times and then at other times I found myself rather stunned and truly shocked as to what happens around Rambo's life. The film clearly takes some huge risks in the plot as well pushing the limits in regards to the film's action and gore. The action is believable and the fast paced shots are done very well. Credit also goes out the soundtrack and sound effects- hearing the amazing Rambo theme again brings a true smile to my face.Overall, considering this is a fifth instalment to a series which began in 1982, the 72 year old actor Sylvester Stallone shows there is plenty of action fuel left in his tank. Rambo fans will be pleased with this film and the continued story of the character many love. Action junkies will also be pleased and shocked to find this new instalment contains even more gore and violence. I found all of this enjoyable and declare it is a worthy instalment to the franchise.7.4/10

I did find the movie intriguing, but I felt like the plot development was poor at times and felt a bit rushed. It was like watching a low-budget or a Netflix movie, but I expect a Netflix movie to have a better plot. I also felt like the acting was basic at times, it wasn't convincing and it was like watching a bunch of rookie actors. I thought that the action scenes were decent, at times I felt they were rushed and felt effortless when for example, he somehow managed to get into the enemy house just by killing around 3 guys in like 20 seconds. The last fight scene was good to watch, but was illogical; but it was cool I guess, so I'll let it off. For me, it just didn't feel like a Rambo movie.",Rambo - Last Blood

A great film brutal bloody full of vengeance and emotions and even some character development.
we saw the great chemistry Rambo had with his young niece and how he tried to protect her. the scene with Rambo and her in the car......(will not spoil it)...was the most touching and one of the best scenes in the movie.

From the violence to the story., it does not shy away from anything and is about as far from feel good as you can imagine.On the violence front, this film is as stark as I have seen in a long time.

180,darkreignn,Make Rambo Great Again,7,28 September 2019,"""Rambo: Last Blood"" is supposedly the ""final"" Rambo film, and stars everyone's favorite action hero, Sylvester Stallone. Now, I don't know about you, but when I go see a Rambo movie I kind of have an idea of what to expect. I'm expecting a slight commentary about the United States military and warfare, but more than that, I'm expecting Sly Stallone to be a complete badass and unleash his wrath on evil and unsuspecting villains who had no idea the fury they've awakened on themselves. And that's what you get here. There are slight (and by slight, I mean slight with a capital S) dramatic elements to this film. There is one particularly effective line that Rambo shares with his niece about wishing someone would've stopped him from joining the war, and then of course there is Rambo's final speech where he talks about warfare and the nature of what it means to fight for a cause, and that's about it. I do admit that I wish this movie would've gotten slightly more dramatic, just like the original film and the 2008 movie was, but I can't say I was dissatisfied with the experience as a whole.""Last Blood"" takes more of a slow burn approach to the world of Rambo, and I found that to be a very welcome change of pace. While the last film opened up with the atrocities of war crime, this opens up with John on his ranch, caring for his horses. This has a slow, methodical pace to it, with short bursts of action taking place along the way to build up to the explosive, absolutely flat out fun finale. The notable lack of action in the first hour of the film might be bothersome to some, but it wasn't to me. Sly's acting carries the movie, and a midway twist just ups the tension even more.A lot of critics have lambasted the film over it's uberviolent content, but I really found the movie to be, while satisfyingly gory, less violent then the 2008 movie. Now, that may be because of the increase of quick cuts. You'll notice that during almost every action scene, quick cuts are used generously. This didn't annoy me too much because it kept the pace quick and kinetic, and for the most part everything that was happening on screen was easy to make out; there was only one part where I genuinely did not know what happened (something comes out of the wall and severs someone's head, and I couldn't tell how or what had happened to cause that). But other than that one scene, I didn't find the use of quick cuts too distracting. Luckily, there was a lack of shaky camera, which I was incredibly grateful for.So if you're looking for action, no doubt you'll be satisfied. If you're looking for story, you might find it lacking. I don't want to spoil much about the story because I purposely went into this film blind, but it's nothing too deep or original. It was still fun because, let's face it, who doesn't want to see Rambo embark on a journey of death and destruction, but I wish that the plot was as shocking and relevant as the 2008 film was.Long story short, this is a good Rambo film, and a good action film. At a quick 89 minutes, this film is short enough that it never feels boring, and long enough to make you wanting more by the end. If you like Rambo, or just action movies in general, you won't regret checking this movie out.7/10",Rambo - Last Blood

He's an action hero, a legend, a truly great person and a damn good actor. First Blood was and forever will be one of a kind post-war drama you would rarely see from Sly but somehow it was turned into an action flick and with each installment it dropped in quality and after Rambo III we thought it died. But twenty years later we got John Rambo that was well received and wasn't dealing with war instead focusing on cartels and in general all of the bad people out there. Another ten years have passed and we got Last Blood... would it really be the last? I don't know. The movie is uninspiring, low on meaning and overall feels like we have seen it all way too many times (at one point in the movie I even made parallels with Home Alone for god's sake) but Sly is still Sly and you get what you most expect from him - bloodshed and violence with over the top realism.

John goes to Mexico to get her back.All this is leading to a final battle on John's ranch where he sets out booby-trapping the ranch including the tunnels. He knows they know where he lives because they took his driver's license. And quite a battle it is when bad guys Hugo ( Sergio Peris-Mencheta) and Victor (Oscar Jaenada) arrive with their minions to kill John Rambo. Be prepared for a very bloody battle. Some scenes are quite shocking, and yes, I did jump several times.

He had told Gabrielle that he hasn't changed (from what he was years ago), and he is just trying to keep a lid on things. But now he discards the pills and wants only one thing: Revenge.This is Rambo as good as it gets, but I don't think this is the final mission. Let's hope not. This is a very good production.

John, now ""retired"", needs to find his stubborn niece in Mexico, since she ran away to find answers about why her father left her and her dying mother.

188,spasek,"""Rambo"" Should Have Been The Last One",6,5 September 2021,"The last film was the curtain call for one John Rambo. Thrust into the middle of a massive genocide, Rambo not only saves a bunch of moronic missionaries, but he finally ends the film by coming home.It's like finally winning $100,000 at blackjack, and instead of walking away, you double-down...and lose it. That is what this movie feels like. It would have been worse if Stallone had decided to make another Rocky movie after ""Rocky Balboa"" (Creed films don't count).A young girl, who is like a daughter to Rambo, decides to venture down to Mexico to find her father and find out why he abandoned her. After Rambo tells her not to go--as if anyone with even half a brain can predict--she goes anyway and finds herself in the middle of a Mexican human-trafficking cartel. Now, Rambo isn't stupid. He would have suggested taking her down there himself after seeing her determination, rather than risk the chance of her going alone. Simple solution. Of course, too often in movies, especially today, character is sacrificed for story. Even when it goes against the character.Also, Rambo is known for his stealth and intelligence in surveying a situation before venturing into it. That was his whole job in Vietnam. Seeing John Rambo walk right into the middle of 30+ guys was laughable. And Stallone obviously forgot all about consistency in character...again! This is something Rambo would have never done.The movie is very predictable, and Stallone decided to showcase Rambo's savagery to a point that is virtually beyond human. This is not the way I wanted to see Rambo end. The last film did justice to Rambo in his quest to finally find some small measure of peace. This movie proves that Rambo is no better than the monsters he kills.The gore was obviously an attempt to showcase the realism of weapons and what they can do. This ain't no 80s Rambo with videogame-style action. This is war brutality at its extreme.The movie, however, isn't a complete failure. On a level, it does work. It's just the last movie was a far superior film in almost every way. And it paid tribute to the lost man stryving to find himself. This movie shows that Rambo has simply given up and given in to the violence he can never escape from. In short, it robs us of hope for John Rambo.",Rambo - Last Blood

He waste ammo on enemies that would've been dead few sec later, or is all ready dead.It seem to be done simply for the gore effect,nothing moreNot to mention, he doesn't seem to know the first thing ,about ambush or guerrilla warfare.

190,Bertaut,"Guns, carnage, xenophobia - everything you could want from a Rambo movie; hugely entertaining",8,7 October 2019,"In the torrent of negative reviews that greeted Rambo: Last Blood, one that stood out was Richard Roeper's zero-star rant for The Chicago Sun Times, in which he said of the film, ""this is a gratuitously violent, shamelessly exploitative, gruesomely sadistic and utterly repellent piece of trash"". I agree with pretty much all of that sentence. And I loved it. But let me segue into asking a question. Which is the more ""responsible"" - the hard R-rated movie that makes no bones about its violent content, or the equally violent PG-13 movie that removes the gore but leaves the savagery? Last Blood is only moderately more violent than most of today's action blockbusters, but it's a damn-sight more honest in its depiction of the impact of violence on the human body. It's like the old joke about The A-Team (1983) - it didn't matter what the level of violence was, the fact that we never saw blood and never saw anyone die meant it was family entertainment. Last Blood is not family entertainment.And it's awesome.Now, make no mistake, it's no masterpiece. In fact, it's barely a movie at all (the script is so rudimentary, it rivals the dizzying complexities of Rocky IV (1985)), and it's by far the least political entry in the Rambo franchise thus far. It's xenophobic. It may stoke irrational fears about the evils of Mexico and permeability of the southern border. It's a film in which Rambo doesn't just kill his enemies, he kills them several times just to be sure. It's a film in which on no less than two occasions, Rambo uses his bare hands to extract internal organs. It's a film that's an immensely enjoyable no-holds-barred revenge actioner that's about as interested in political correctness as it is in millennial angst. Which is to say, not even remotely.And it's awesome.It has been 11 years since Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) returned to his father's ranch in Bowie, Arizona. His father has died, but Rambo remains at the ranch, breaking in horses and sharing his home with live-in housekeeper Maria Beltran (Adriana Barraza) and her teenage granddaughter Gabriela (Yvette Monreal), who he helped to raise. All is quiet until Gabriela is contacted from Mexico by her friend Gizelle (Fenessa Pineda), who tells her she has located Gabriela's father Manuel (Marco de la O), who walked out on her and her dying mother when she was still a child. Although advised by both Rambo and Maria not to go to Mexico, she ignores their warnings. However, on her first night there, she is drugged and abducted by the Martinez brothers, Hugo (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) and Victor (Óscar Jaenada). When Rambo comes looking for her, he earns a beating for his trouble, and so, realising he can't fight the cartel on their terms, he decides to lure them back to Arizona, where he can fight them on his.Undeniably, for better or worse, the Rambo films have always found a way to tap into some of the major geopolitical issues of the era in which they were made. Introduced in David Morrell's superb 1972 novel, the character was brought to the screen 10 years later in First Blood (1982). One of many Vietnam-vet-comes-home-and-is-rejected-by-society films made in the years following the end of the Vietnam War (1955-1975), it presented Rambo as an embodiment of the problems of unaddressed-PTSD. Made in the second year of Ronald Reagan's presidency, it argued that you can't create killing machines for use in a foreign war and then simply bring them home and expect them to reintegrate. The next two films also took place during Reagan's presidency, at a time when the wounds of Vietnam were still fresh, but the idea of American exceptionalism had started to morph into a kind of over-compensatory machismo. This saw Rambo transition from being an allegory for the struggles of vets to an embodiment of jingoistic Regan-era American militarism and juvenile wish-fulfilment (in the second film, Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985), he literally gets a second crack at winning in Vietnam). In essence, he had changed from a symbol for the psychological damage of war to an undefeatable representative of American military might. The fourth film, Rambo (2008), came out in the final year of George W. Bush's presidency at a time when the US (in no small part because of an illegal war) had once again risen to the position of global police force, although the fact that he's on a mission to save, of all things, Christian aid workers, is a bit on the nose even for this franchise.Which brings us to Last Blood. Written by Stallone and Matthew Cirulnick, from a story by Dan Gordon, and directed by Adrian Grunberg, Last Blood comes in the fourth year of Donald Trump's presidency, and sees Rambo facing off against the bad hombres south of the border (they bring drugs, they bring crime, although some, he assumes, are good people). And with a border this porous (characters easily cross over with weaponry, drugs, dead bodies, and decapitated heads), the only person who can protect the US of A from such villains is Don J. Trumpo...sorry, John J. Rambo.However, having said that, this is far and away the least political film of the franchise. Whilst the first and second both dealt with Vietnam, the third with the Soviet-Afghan war, and the fourth with the Myanmar Civil War, Last Blood doesn't explicitly deal with a real-world conflict and is not set in an inherently politicised milieu. And this ties into a crucial point - in moving out of the arena of politics, the storyline is more personal, which is important insofar as Rambo himself is presented somewhat differently, showing more emotion than we've seen from him since the opening few scenes of First Blood. The film also focuses on his PTSD, which had been relatively ignored in the three previous films. Here, not only is he shown as still suffering the effects, he actually leans into it, using his trauma to motivate himself. In this sense, the early parts of the film work extremely well - see Rambo in a home, we see him trying to keep his demons at bay, we see him, for arguably the first time, with something to lose.However, for better or worse, the film's big selling point isn't the political allegory or the character's psychology - it's the action, the ""suit-up"" moment when Rambo unleashes hell. Here, the entire third-act is one long action scene, and it's entertaining enough to temper much of the political immaturity and distasteful stereotypes that lead up to it. Well shot by director Grunberg and cinematographer Brendan Galvin, it's kind of the inverse of the sleek action scenes found in the John Wick films - it's dark, gritty, and brutal, and whereas those films often create the impression of near weightlessness, here, it's the tangible physicality that works so well, the sense of visceral devastation that results from a particular impact rather than anything balletic.Of course, a vital aspect of any Rambo movie is that a lot of what some people love will be the exact things that others despise. In this case, it's the laughably simplistic politics, the barely disguised xenophobia, the brutal violence, and the fetishisation of weaponry. On this last point, I can't recall, off the top of my head, another film which is so blatant in its glorification of guns, whether it's the long tracking shots of Rambo's collection of rifles, or the way the film lingers on the destruction they mete out.The film's handling of the Mexican portion of the story is a good example of how you either decry the stupidity or celebrate the ridiculousness. The character of Gizelle, for example, dresses like the only research the costume department did was to watch Stand and Deliver (1988), whilst poor Gabriela gets abducted after ONE night in Mexico. And as for the aforementioned porousness of the border, I'm not sure if it's appallingly lazy writing or satirical genius, but Rambo gets back into the US by finding a quiet section and ploughing his truck through the wire mesh fence. He wouldn't have been able to do that if there'd been a wall.A criticism that I would treat a little more seriously, however, is that although this is supposed to be the last chapter in the franchise, there's no sense of finality. Nothing happens at any point where you could say to yourself, ""that seems a fitting send-off for the character"". In fact, the previous film felt more final than this one. Another problem is the script. Much as Rocky IV was two boxing matches loosely tied together by montages, Last Blood is 40 minutes of plot loosely connected to an extended action scene via, you guessed it, a series of montages.Finally, it would be remiss of me not to mention David Morrell's opinion on the film. After seeing it, he wrote on Twitter, ""the film is a mess. Embarrassed to have my name associated with it"", and later he told Newsweek, ""I felt degraded and dehumanised after I left the theatre. Instead of being soulful, this new movie lacks one. I felt I was less a human being for having seen it.""Make of that what you will.In many ways, Last Blood is a hilariously bad film. But it's also a hugely entertaining film. Sure, the violence is off the chart and the politics are hilariously naïve at best, dangerously reductionist at worse. But it's extremely well shot, Stallone gives a predictably strong performance, the action is intense, and none of the problems are so large as to render the film unenjoyable. Approach it with the right frame of mind, and you'll find much to appreciate.",Rambo - Last Blood

192,Lewis_Heather787,Did anyone really need this??,3,19 September 2019,"Does this film add anything of any value to the character of John Rambo??? To me the answer to that question is slightly mixed but I'd be lying if I didn't say I was more leaning towards.........probably not. I must also mentioned even though this isn't going to be the most flattering of reviews there are few things about the film that almost worked.Talking of the positives lets get them out of the way first. The two main performances of Sylvester Stallone and Yvette Monreal are good for the most part. It sort of seems that they have good chemistry so it makes their relationship some what believable. Stallone just falls straight back into the character that he made so famous all those years ago, he definitely shows some age. However I think that plays to the films advantage because it shows growth and arc to the character and that......people change. I must say I was a little shocked that they actually killed of Yvette Monreal's character......there was no happy ending there.As far as positives go thats it unfortunately......Now I sorry to anyone how liked this film but I'm going to have to say it........this film was bad, for a few very good reasons......in my opinion.It is extremely......if not the definition of generic, the story to this film would have been generic back in the 80's so who thought it would be a great idea in 2019. The film industry has changed, action films don't have to be simple and basic with loads of explosions. Now I'm not suggesting that there is anything wrong with those types of films....there is isn't, they have there time and place. However the first two ""Rambo"" films were more complex, well at least ""First Blood"" was. They had depth and an edge to them that was brilliant to watch, however none of this was in this film.Carrying on with the generic/basic theme, I am shocked but at the same time sort of not because we live in very confusing times.....let me explain. I'll just put it straight out there this film is extremely stereotypical if not a bit xenophobic. Maybe I'm reading too much into the film, but the very old idea of the ""white american hero"" going to save the ""vulnerable woman in destress"" from the ""very bad"" mexican's......blah blah really come on!!!!! Its just very sad to see that the ""Rambo"" franchise has rubber stamped its name on this film because it doesn't feel like its connected to others at all in terms of tone.Overall its 30% out of 100 its bad, unfortunately. It has two little sparks of hope that this film could have been ok if the story and writing were more up to par, however due to the negatives I've said I'll probably never watch it again. Yeah does the action at the end try and save the film......yes.....its entertaining, however it doesn't remove the bad taste in mouth from the film as a whole.......its probably save to say just watch the first two films.",Rambo - Last Blood

197,peeedeee-94281,"Predictable, but not in a good way",3,28 September 2019,"Rambo has the same formula, you get him mad, he comes after you. But this had a new twist, he had the bad guys come to him!
Unfortunately, that's in the second half and the fun part of the movie. The first half is a slow, drawn out drama that tries to set up the emotional turmoil he will feel later in the movie, but it's just plain corny. Stallone walks and talks like zombie or frankenstein's monster, and so its hard to suspend belief he can take on so many guys. And in reality, you see that he couldn't. It really didn't make any sense why he'd walk in there, mutter a few words, then find himself getting beaten up. I also didn't understand what happened to his niece, why she didn't make it back. Unless it was because she just gave up.
Anyway, Stallone delivers some pretty hilariously gory moments in that last act. In many ways, it was serious overkill, and that's why it was unintentionally funny.
The movie overall, though, is very serious in tone. And features some really bad camera work, like all of the driving scenes (filmed with obviously green screen), a really bad closeup in profile of Stallone and a lady reporter talking, and a very bad extreme zoom when he pulls his pickup truck over to the side of the road.
I can't give this one good marks, because it just didn't feel as satisfying as the last entry from 2008. Wait for this one to stream. Be prepared for a lot of gore.",Rambo - Last Blood

199,kingofdanerds,They did this film without Liam Neeson,4,13 January 2021,"For a while, Rambo (2008) was intended to be the final Rambo film as it did come full circle. But you know how the movie industry is like. So in 2019, the released what is supposed to be the final Rambo film titled Rambo: Last Blood. The film was directed by Adrian Grunberg who does not have many directing credits to his name (as of the time of this review, he has three main directing credits). Sylvester Stallone once again wrote the screenplay for this film and once again stars in this film as John Rambo. Upon release, the film did rather well at the box office but this film manages to be the lowest grossing film in the franchise. Reception from critics were mixed with a lot of fans not being real pleased and even the author of First Blood hating this film. The film even won two Razzies. I remember the first time I saw the trailer for this film (and at this time I only had seen the first Rambo film) and I do remember being excited for the fact that it is a new Rambo film. But the excitement did not last long as I lost interest in wanting to see this film. It was only recently that I picked this film up on DVD at my local electronics store for about $3.John Rambo lives on a horse ranch in Arizona. He has like a family with this women and her granddaughter. This granddaughter is Gabrielle. She is a typical teenager who lost her mom years ago and her dad left her. She really wants to go out and find her father but Rambo believes she should not. She goes to Mexico without Rambo knowing and ends up getting captured by the cartel who use her in sex trafficking. It is up to Rambo to go and save her.Rambo: Last Blood is probably the worst of the Rambo films and for various reasons. For one, most of the film (about 80 percent or so) is most definitely not a Rambo film. As my headline for this review indicates, they did this film without Liam Neeson. Why did I say that? Because the plot is extremely close to the Taken films which star Liam Neeson. With that being said, I am not entertained by a large chunk of this film. Now, the last 20 minutes are amazing despite being the same old stuff but it is more entertaining than whatever came before it. The reason why this film disappointed fans was because of the first 80 or so percent of this film. Yes, the acting is fine for the most part. Yes, Sylvester Stallone literally could have played the same character with a different name and nothing about this film would have changed. Yes, the characters are not great. There is a character named Carmen who is entirely pointless in this film. Nothing new is done with the character of Rambo besides giving him a haircut and making him older. I do believe that at times that film tries to go back to it's origins in terms of Rambo's character but it does not go into full effect. The violence does appear early on but most of it is all in the last act. The violence in here is most definitely not on the same level as Rambo (2008), but I will say that this film is a close second. The last act is the best part of the film and was lots of fun to watch. I would even go on to argue that it was better than the last act of the previous film. Everything that should be in a Rambo movie for the most part is in this last act and this is where I finally see Rambo in this film actually be Rambo. With this being called Rambo: Last Blood, surely this film wraps up this series? To me, no it does not. Rambo (2008) seemed to do that fine. This film just ends and I don't feel any sort of satisfaction either. Again, I felt satisfaction in Rambo (2008). What a shame...Rambo: Last Blood is a disappointment for me. Most of the film is slow and does not have what a Rambo film should have. That is until the last act which is really what saves this film from getting a lower rating.",Rambo - Last Blood
200,springsunnywinter,"To survive a war, you gotta become war",10,19 September 2019,"Sylvester Stallone is probably the only actor ever to maintain two movie franchises in five decades with Rocky and Rambo.Its really hard to talk about this movie without spoiling it as there is so much to spoil.Judging by the trailers it was described as Taken meets Home Alone and that's what it turned out to be but don't let you put you off from this movie as it feels like a fresh new take on the Rambo franchise and every snowflake has it own design.First Blood was the best Rambo movie as it had emotional content and character development then the rest of them were entertaining action movies and Last Blood stays true to the original. I'm really glad that they didn't make another war action movie with tanks and gunships as the previous three Rambo movies already did that. In this movie Rambo was using strategy over fire power just like the first one.Before the release of this movie the original concept was ""Rambo V: The Savage Hunt"" where Rambo had to find and destroy a genetically engineered monster and was based on a novel called Hunter by James Bryon Hunter and Sly owns the rights for but didn't get green-lit, maybe because it was too similar to Predator. So I was really disappointed when I heard that as it was a fascinating concept but after watching this movie I think it was for the best.The best thing about Rambo: Last Blood is that it makes you feel for the main characters which is what a lot of movies nowadays are failing to do and if you want nothing but brainless action then it's best avoided.",Rambo - Last Blood
201,blrnani,A very fitting closure (with the door left ajar),6,30 December 2019,"I am sorry, but it is impossible to do justice to this film without lots of spoilers - so you've been warned.
For those who have followed the Rambo series, it was nice to see John comfortably at home on his inherited ranch and a respected member of the community (we see him rescuing a woman in a storm, but eating his heart out that he couldn't rescue the other 2 people, who died in the flood). Indeed it is clear John still has his nightmares and anguish and resorts to medication to quell the pain).
But he has a ready made family, courtesy of the Mexican caretaker who walked out on his wife and child. 'Uncle' John has been a surrogate father to the lovely Gabriela, who is soon to go off to college, but is bothered by the nagging question of why 'Dad' abandoned us (so one valuable lesson we learn from the film is that 'Mum & Dad' are the people who raise you and to hell with biology). A girl Gabriela thought was her friend and who also returned to Mexico, has located her father and she wants to ask him personally.
Rambo and her mother are categorical that the guy was no good and to move on with her life. They don't think much of 'friend' Gizelle either. That's not Mexican bashing, it's bashing fathers - of any race or nationality - who walk out on their family because they don't want the 'baggage' and responsibility; and treacherous false friends who will sell you out when an opportunity arises.
Because so much of the media tells young people to ignore their parents, with their old-fashioned ideas, and to follow their heart, Gabriela goes to Mexico and guess what: her 'sperm provider' tells her he never loved them and found them an inconvenience, while her 'friend' sells her out to a local crime gang, then tries to cover her guilt by telling Gabriela's mother her daughter's been abducted.
Rambo 'visits' the father and friend and, seeing through the latter, forces her to point out the 'kidnapper'. He then follows him outside and brutally forces him to show where Gabriela is being held. At this point I really don't know what Rambo was thinking. He's never been the most eloquent individual - one of the big reasons he became such a mess in the first place - yet did he really think he was simply going to talk the gang into handing Gabriela over. He walks into the lair - a typical Lat.Am. slum labyrinth of alleyways on a hillside - gets cornered and beaten up.
Indeed he only survives for 2 reasons: 1) the sadistic leader wants him to carry the burden of knowing his stupidity caused them to inflict worse treatment on Gabriela; and 2) because an investigative journalist followed them from the club and managed to haul him back to her place to recuperate.
Once he's recovered, Rambo does what he does. He goes to the bordelo to which Gabriela has been transferred, brutally kills all the men, is confused that the women are too terrified of the gang to consider fleeing, and rescues Gabriela. However, she's been so overdosed on drugs and weakened by the bad treatment that she dies on the journey home. It was nevertheless understandable why he hadn't taken her to a Mexican hospital or gone through border control, although in retrospect the former might have been able to save her life - even though it might have been impossible to keep her alive, much less get her safely out of the country afterwards.
So we now have a grief-striken Rambo who is now bent on revenge. He wants them on home territory, so he sends Gabriela's mother to stay with her sister and prepares his defences. Then he conducts a raid into Mexico and removes the head of the gang leader's brother - who'd marked both his and Gabriela's faces with the knife he'd taken off Rambo.
That brings the whole gang to Arizona. Rambo tells the boss he'd ripped out his heart and ""Now I'm going to do the same to you!"" and he keeps his promise, literally.
This film is brutal and graphic, but the same people who are criticising this probably laud Tarantino's graphic sadism as 'artistic genius'. We probably should be concerned about applauding it all, but one also has to bear in mind that the public taste for violence escalates every time society as a whole feels that the criminals are the ones with all the rights and the victims are inconsequential unless they happen to be PC victims of colour or of rapists.
As for the accusations of racism, 3 of the leading characters on the good side are Mexicans. And it is a sad truth that society in Mexico is dominated by ruthless criminal gangs that attach no value to human life and their existence is aided and abetted by many members of the police force and government who are the people's only hope of combating them. The dominion of money over public decency, law & order is a problem worldwide, but the sordid reality in Mexico is realistically portrayed (watch Sicario if you want to see the heroes trying to combat and change it). Of course that isn't the only facet to life in Mexico, but this isn't a Mexican travelogue.
We know where Rambo stands over right and wrong and it's revealing how the situation brings out in him a dark side he'd hoped was buried, if not forgotten. He was an ordinary guy who was trained to be a killer and then sent off to fight a war where kill count was the only meaningful statistic. Then he came home and was marginalized, shunned and spat on. But the powers still had use for him and Rambo came to symbolise US exceptionalism and its world policeman role. Now he thought he'd found relative peace, but life isn't so simple.
The ending, while closing the circle, left room for more of the series. He might have bled out, sitting in his rocking chair, with no more reason to go on. Or he might find a violent world still has uses for his skills. Will his broken body keep going? Will they go for a prequel, introducing another actor? Personally, I think this is as good a place as any to stop - Sly has plenty of other options in the fire that don't require him to physically suffer before winning out.",Rambo - Last Blood

It was so fun swimming in a bloodbath (I am making an appointment with my shrink after I post this) and this is the worst tourism movie featuring Mexico. The whole country basically only had 2 good persons and I love how simple it is to draw a bad guy. If you have tattoos, wear singlets, have bulging muscles, wear chunky necklaces, have an automatic stuck in your waist band, have a leery moustache, rape girls with your eyes and talk with bad grammar, you are a f$cking bad guy.

210,arabnikita,The Legend of action is back and is more violent than ever!!!,7,18 September 2019,"Rambo Last Blood (2019)At 73, most people prefer to sit at home, relax and reminisce their youth while being surrounded by their family. Sylvester Stallone was not built that way and this year he made a movie to prove that action stars of the 80s simply don't age. Obviously he has lost a step or two and is not flying around the screen like he used to but at bloody 73, he is still a one man army and the living proof that age is just a number.Rambo Last Blood is a no nonsense grim action movie with a cliche plot that does not pretend be bigger than it is. Nobody is saving the world from mass enslavement, spies or nuclear threats. It is a simple revenge thriller with loads of action, grit and violence that can easily rival John Wick in terms of creativity. Stallone is a lone wolf who still has sharp fangs despite his gray hair and his enemies will find out just how sharp these fangs are.Very similar to previous Rambo films, just on a smaller scale, so it goes without saying that if you are a fan of the franchise, 80-90s action or Stallone in general then you will feel right at home. Fast pace, simple narrative, grim settings and plently of violence give Last Blood a genuine throwback feel to the golden days of action.#moviesshmovies on Instagram",Rambo - Last Blood
211,nigelmacdonald-97173,The dumbest of the lot.,3,10 July 2020,This bares no resemblance to the original or even the increasingly silly sequels. A paper thin and incredibly predictable plot. It's more like a super violent episode of the A Team with just as cartoonish bad guys.,Rambo - Last Blood
212,MinistryofDoom,A Great Conclusion to the Ballad of John Rambo,7,24 November 2019,"Rambo: Last Blood is a seemingly fitting end to the legend of John Rambo. According to the lore of the film series, Rambo is now 72 years old. After having gone through may traumatic experiences around the world, we find him retired at his family's horse ranch where he is the last living member of the Rambo family. There he spends his days raising horses, forging decorative knives in his underground bunker, and take care of his adopted daughter, Gabby, the grand-daughter of his platonic friend and ranch worker, Maria Beltran, who spends her days serving as the de-facto matriarch. Rambo isn't as physically fit as he once was, and it's clear that the events of Vietnam, Myanmar, Afghanistan, etc...have physical and psychological damaged him; he relies on daily doses of medication to keep the hallucinations at bay, and to prevent his PTSD from affecting his thinking. This film shows us a John Rambo who is a vulnerable old man struggling to bury his demons, and who keeps himself isolated on a remote farm for the sake of others as well as himself. The only thread that keeps his humanity intact is his innocent adopted daughter and his need to provide her with safety and security.However that thread is severed when Gabby goes to Mexico in search of answers from her biological father, against Maria and John's wishes. Events take a turn for the worst when she encounters a Mexican cartel that deals in drugs and forced prostitution. This event awakens the long dormant killer buried deep within Rambo.While the action sequences of the film seem implausible at times, they are, in fact, keeping with the tradition of unflinching brutal violence depicted throughout the Rambo franchise. Though to be clear, Rambo takes no pleasure in his acts but carries them out as raw and emotional responses to the attacks perpetrated against his struggle for humanity. Earlier in the film he says, ""I know how black a man's heart can be"" and this is the theme that is carried throughout the film. When you remove his humanity and the things that keep him grounded, he becomes a violent beast.Sylvester Stallone is, as usual, amazing in his role as John Rambo. He has worn his age well and this affects his portrayal of Rambo. Paz Vega is also in this film but you'll only see her for about 20 minutes in total. Adriana Barazza was excellent as Maria Beltran. I would have liked to have seen more from her, but her scenes were done very well. Cinematography, Art Direction, Script....it all fits together so well. This is the best conclusion to John Rambo that we could have gotten. It is raw, emotional, and doesn't sugarcoat the extremely dark and ugly nature of violence and crime.Overall, an excellent film. I give this a 7 out of 10.",Rambo - Last Blood
213,FKDZ,Simple but Brutal.,6,30 September 2019,"Overall a very enjoyable Rambo movie, albeit this one having a bit more dialog than previous ones, but it does provide a nice build up towards the final scene which makes it all worth it if you're into seeing people get brutally murdered in almost every way possible. This movie certainly does bring home the extreme violence.Aside from that the story is alright. Action movie stuff with a slight dark twist which I did not expect. This twist sadly does remove much of the purpose of the final scene and in consequence the entire movie. Acting is decent, Stallone's age is definitely showing and its good to know this will be the final piece.All in all just a decent action movie and with a great little montage of past movies during the credits which I liked.",Rambo - Last Blood

I don't waste time with critic's reviews anymore, I prefer the reviews of the regular audience member. This is a Rambo movie. We don't want a lot of exposition, we're here for the action. Character development? It's John Rambo, we met him in the 80's. We're here to watch Rambo get wronged by a group of bad people so he can enact his violent revenge. We don't want nuanced dialogue, we want monosyllabic speech puntuated by gunfire, explosions and gratuitous violence.

218,WatchAndSmile,lol... It's pretty bad as in LOL bad!,4,23 November 2019,"So, until the very end, there was pretty much no action, just story from the 90s. Some really bad editing took place, bad directing and average anything else.
Seems like a B-rated movie with B-rated script with an A actor.Those who say they loved this action movie an gave me 7+ are probably never seen the movie, some weirdos with a fetish for Stalone or have some psycological issues. 100s of better movies than this get under 5 rating. This does not deserve more than 5!
A lot of the stuff in the movie had nothing to do with the movie, like the useless beginning. The movie being half in Spanish didn't help it either.Overall, 4/10. All for for exactly 10 minutes of action out of 100 minutes the movie runs.Let's let the Rambo die",Rambo - Last Blood

220,Breumaster,"Not the Best, but a Worthy Farewell for John Rambo.",6,4 February 2020,"I did like the story, even though it had some very pretty locigal lacks. After all the ending of the Rambo saga was worthy. I did like the conclussion, but still have to admit that the movie broke down the complexity of social millieus like eating an ice cream. But when I go into a movie of that franchise, I don't wait for Shakespeare or Jane Austen. This movie is rampage like I awaited. So I'm not dissappointed, but still think that it is miles away from a real good movie like e.g.: 'Road to Perdition', which deals with some gangster millieu in a very better way. I did like the way rambo prepared for the showndown. It's a recommendation for fans. :D",Rambo - Last Blood
221,stevepat99,Rambo: Wasted Blood,1,1 December 2019,"Even those who give this failed movie a 10 rating must agree with some facts:
(1) During one hour and nine minutes there is virtually no positive action except when he knocks a few guys around in a house (2) Rambo using zero plan or reconnaissance walks into a drug cartel house where he allows himself to be disarmed of his only weapon, one knife, and beaten senseless. He had no reason to believe they would not kill him and puts up no defense...sad! (3) He is rescued and recovers over four days during which his beloved teenage faux daughter is being drugged and raped likely many dozens of times so even at this early point he has totally failed in his mission (4) he rescues her and seeing she is in an overdose state does not get her life saving treatment but rather takes her on a car ride which allows her to die in the front seat. His mission at this point is a total failure. (5) No other Rambo movie plot has anything even close to this non-Rambo nonsense.Then, we have a fun final 30 minutes of Rambo's revenge, a fun Rambo blood bath. I assume all the 10 ratings are based on the final 30 minutes of Rambo 'action.'
No other Rambo movie has show him to be such an utter failure in his primary mission or as in First Blood defending himself. No other Rambo film has shown him so lacking in planning and skill that allows him to walk into a den or murderers with no plan, no way out and every expectation he's going to be killed.
He owes his life to the worst evil murderer in this story. This is not Rambo.",Rambo - Last Blood

224,nayeemiqbal_,We already have lot of Rambo.???,5,12 April 2020,The failed attempt for the Rambo last blood. Literally last blood of the series. Giving the closure to Rambo. The movie lacks everything. Only good thing is the action scene at the end. The question raised about biological father ?! Is he really the daddy? We have to deal with our past indiscretions and make peace with them.,Rambo - Last Blood
225,collectorofsorts,It's a OK movie. Not like the other Rambo movies though. More like 'Rambo' Meets 'Home Alone'.,7,24 November 2019,"I enjoyed the movie. Wasn't what I expected though. It was basically Rambo turns ranch hand on a relatives ranch. Then his niece does something stupid and gets herself taken by two brothers in the Mexican Cartel to work in the brothels and Rambo goes to rescue her. She ends up dying and he takes her home to bury her. Then he ends up returning to Mexico to kill one of the brothers and entices the other to follow him back to the ranch where he has all the 'home alone' style boobytraps waiting for them. To make a long story short, he kills all except the last brother and then pins him to the barn wall with arrows and rips out the guys heart ""like the guy did his"". The end. It was an enjoyable movie. Just different from the others because of his ranch hand and family oriented work. I think it was a good closure for the Rambo series though. All that being said, rating it more that 6-7 Stars is ridiculous. Rambo failed his mission. He acted foolish walking into a hornets nest of 30-40 armed men without watching first to see what he was walking into, got beaten badly and was unconscious for 4 days. Meanwhile, the Cartel Brothers punished the girl for his actions and she ended up dying. How can you rate it any higher when he got the girl killed?",Rambo - Last Blood

This one, however, went back to the roots of who Rambo is. A messed up ex vet struggling to survive, and finding himself having to deal with trouble he can't avoid.Not perfect, there are flaws, nothing is ever perfect... But highly enjoyable. No politically correct agenda that almost all movies seen to go for these days, no director trying to be artistic, no confusing story arc to try and be different... Just John Rambo, bringing it home. Literally.",Rambo - Last Blood
227,a.lampert,A gore fest so be warned,7,19 July 2020,"I gave Rambo Last Blood 7 stars simply because I found it quite exciting and very watchable. It's questionable whether any taste is involved as it's a real gore fest. I have reservations about the treatment of women in the picture although I thought there were two good performances by Adriana Barazza and Yvette Monreal. It follows a familiar pattern, much like Death Wish, niece of Uncle John Rambo is treated unspeakably so Uncle John wants revenge, which is on a monumental scale. Sylvester Stallone goes from caring uncle to Rambo in the blink of an eye and we all know what that means. His choice of weapons is just about anything he can lay his hands on, fire, explosives, hammers, knives, guns, nails, spears, spikes, bow and arrows, you name it, he's a master of them all. A positive one man army he takes on a cartel of Mexican pimps and drug barons and before long all hell breaks lose. Initially he comes a cropper but that just makes him all the more determined and we see the aged Sly giving the franchise it's one last glorious shot. I'm sad to see it end as it's given me much enjoyment over the years, I particularly like the 2008 fourth pic, Rambo and loved his use of the bow and arrows. All very gory so be warned but it's not much dwelt on, most scenes are so rapid you hardly have time to examine the detail and you're on to the next slaughter. 7 stars but very bad taste.",Rambo - Last Blood
228,Condemned-Soul,Angry Stallone remains a joy to watch,8,10 October 2019,"John Rambo has been to hell and back many times. There's nothing he hasn't seen, and nothing he can unsee. He's haunted by the past, by the torture, by the bloodshed. Now, 10 years on from his last battle, he is settled down in a quiet location with people he's come to care for, or, as Rambo puts it: a family he didn't think he'd ever have. Things change when his old friend's granddaughter wants to find her father down in Mexico; a search that has dreadful consequences, pushing John Rambo once again into a world of hurt.The story is serviceable - giving Rambo more words than usual - and Stallone capably handles the material. Predictably, he is also the only character really worth rooting for; none of the characters are necessarily bad, but the film's lean runtime doesn't really flesh supporting characters out as much as it could. But that's fine. Because fans want to see Stallone in revenge mode, and it isn't long before his weapons come out to play and the blood is spilled.Witnessing an angry Sylvester Stallone remains a joy to watch, and the resulting rampage is brutally satisfying as per series standards. Just like the title character, its easy to take sadistic pleasure in watching many horrible people meet a grim demise, and violence is never less than graphic. But bloodshed is what Rambo: Last Blood is all about, and as the central character is taken back to his inventive trap-killing roots, its hard to keep a smile off your face seeing Stallone create carnage one last time.8/10",Rambo - Last Blood

This is a great final tribute to the Rambo character.

232,chevolek,Worst Rambo film to date,5,21 September 2019,"The movie is unlike the 4 previous Rambo films. It was kind of weird to watch Rambo as a cowboy and fighting supposedly mexican sex traffickers. Actually in the whole movie there is only 1 mexican old lady, the rest of the cast are spaniard actors and the movie was actually filmed in Spain, not Mexico. I believe perhaps Stallone feared for his life if a cartel would retaliate or something.
They did a pretty good job speaking like mexicans, though, even with the mexican slang.
Unfortunately this film could support Trump´s anti-mexican propaganda but we all should know, mexican bad guys are just a bunch, not the whole country.
Rambo goes into a hateful revenge rampage to avenge a mexican protegée unlike Rambo: First Blood Part II where he doesn´t show his hate to avenge the murdered asian girlfriend.
There are two scenes I want to mention without giving much detail: In one, his face looked like Rocky in round 15 and in the other one he gets to the border and there is only a barb wire and a ""No pass"" sign and no border agents on sight and he just crosses back into the U.S. like walking down the street and no one seems to know. This was like a cartoon scene from The Road Runner.
I would recommend it to watch it later when it releases on blu-ray. No worth the money.",Rambo - Last Blood
233,marc5477,Not sure why its called Rambo,3,21 September 2019,"The character portrayed in this film is practically the opposite of the Rambo we loved in 1st blood. The original Rambo was emotionally drained and tried to avoid violence only to be forced back into that world (a la John Wick). This one is just in it for revenge and the movie plays out like any old revenge flick you have ever seen, both mindless and boring. To accommodate the lack of story telling, the plots have become over the top with shock value to keep your attention.Anyway, if all you want is mindless action minus comedy then this might be ok for you. I personally like funny action flicks like John Wick or the Die Hard series, but this movie takes itself very seriously and I did not enjoy that at all. For a serious movie, you need good writing and a compelling story which the 1st Rambo did much better.",Rambo - Last Blood
234,rmirchandani,"Just on par with Rambo 4, but not as fast paced and awesome as Rambo II!",9,20 September 2019,"Rambo: Last Blood is a violent, terrifying and action packed movie. It completely exceeded my expectations and thought that it ended perfectly.John Rambo finally found his peace, after going on a killing spree and luring the Mexican drug dealers and rapists to his farm. I felt so relieved that Rambo killed all these terrible people who sedated and kidnapped his adoptive daughter and turned her into a prostitute. It makes me angry and upset how men can be so cruel. John Rambo had a tough life and has seen a lot of death. He survived the Vietnam war, saved the prisoners of war from Thailand, saved his good friend Trautman from the ruins of Afghanistan and saved the church people from the Military embankment in Burma (now Myanmar). Now, Rambo saved his adoptive daughter Gabriella, but sadly it was too late. She died on the way to Rambo's farm.The gore and action in this movie is insane. While not reaching the heights of Rambo II, it was still a solid entry and conclusion to the Rambo franchise. In this movie, Rambo did not have long hair which was a tad disappointing.To conclude, Rambo: Last Blood does not have a unique storyline, but its visceral action and bloodiness makes it a movie worth the watch. Especially, the scene where Rambo rips the guy's heart out!",Rambo - Last Blood

237,justinwfirestone,A sunset for Rambo,6,2 October 2019,"It makes sense for John Rambo to get one last dance on the silver screen. He defeated Afghanistan (Rambo III), returned all the Vietnam POWs (Rambo II), destroyed a Burmese village (Rambo IV), and evaded arrest in the state of Washington (Rambo I).The final installment suggests from the opening scene that this will be a ride off into the sunset, as Rambo performs dressage on a lonesome Arizona ranch near the Mexican border. It's a simpler life, away from the dark hearts of bad people yet still within driving distance of the Mexican version of Mos Eisley. Not all is well, as we learn Rambo still suffers from PTSD, something he keeps at bay with prescription drugs, a stark contrast with William Munny from Unforgiven, who avoided whiskey to keep his demons at bay.Rambo finds quietude on the ranch not only through dressage, but also through tunnel construction and repair. The tunnels lie hidden beneath the Arizona sun, providing a place to truly get away from it all.Rambo V gathers elements from many movies: Taken, Unforgiven, Oldboy (2003), Straw Dogs, The Godfather Part III, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, The Counselor, and Home Alone. Sometimes it really is one man against the world, a man who needs the love of women and the addresses of the men who hurt them.Rambo rightly serves up little dialogue, saving his bon mots for voice-over soliloquies, like a John Wayne Hamlet, a metaphor for an old rocking chair and the Downfall of the American Dream. Rambo stands for what is right, even if his methods are unorthodox or unsound. Or perhaps Rambo is the ultimate anarchist, with his penchant for punching holes in walls?",Rambo - Last Blood

240,TheMovieDoctorful,"A Relentlessly Dark, Tragic Sequel With A Couple Fumbles Here & There",8,23 September 2019,"Not a masterpiece, but a surprisingly worthy sequel and one of the year's more underrated films. Extremely dark.Even more depressing and bleak than the last sequel which is saying a lot since the last one had the bad guys gunning down unarmed children.Stallone's performance is one of my favorites of the year and the actress playing Gabrielle does a surprisingly heartfelt and emotional job. I felt an almost protective instinct whenever she showed up on screen and you can easily see why Rambo would lose his mind trying to protect her.Visual direction is pretty solid too. Rambo's world feels grimy but enormous, like he's a perpetual wanderer with no place in the world.A lot of reviews have compared the violence to a grotesque slasher movie and they'd be right, but it honestly fits this film. It's not like the other sequels where Rambo is on a heroic quest to liberate the oppressed and brig justice; it's a tragedy of a destroyer past his prime lashing out in horrifying vengeance when his world comes crashing down.The ending feels a bit forced and the film does get overly expository a lot in the first act (and a fair amount of the characters are definitely offensive stereotypes), but it's nowhere near the MAGA nightmare critics made it out to be. If anything, it seems pretty critical and damning of the jingoistic idea that a beefed up American dude with guns can go to another country and fix its corruption. Nobody is saved here by Rambo's actions, (in fact, several innocent people who he was trying to help suffer for them) nobody is redeemed, it's a crushingly hopeless film that's rarely fun but often gripping.",Rambo - Last Blood

His intensity was good enough in some parts (not epic). However, they could have kept all of the Spangalish, stereotype nonsense that added absolutely nothing to the movie besides a body count. Also, the overly used ""Taken"" plot is tiresome.The first half of the movie is strait out of ""Taken"". The rest of the movie is just Friday The 13th without the hockey mask. If you enjoy slasher flicks without the need of a brain cell to watch, you will love this film. The carnage was so over the top I just sat like a zombie and watched the film go by with no emotional connection to a single character including Jason Voorhees (unmasked), aka John Rambo. BTW, Rambo would not waste time shooting dead bodies. He was ninja-stealth.The bed-scene kill and the last kill were so Friday The 13th I just shook my head and looked forward to the credits to signal the end. What a stupid movie.

It was simple, contained, exciting, very well-acted, featured memorable characters, and it subverted expectations. Who was expecting the movie to end the way that it did? It's not flawless, but for an action movie it's pretty solid. And it makes for a good character study.

The first and the second installments were amazing. The third one lacked but the fourth one filled that gap.But when I heard about Sly doing the 5th installment. I wasn't that excited. Even though I am a Sly fan. I thought Sly has become old now. He won't deliver as compared to his previous ones when he was younger. But I am so so much glad that i have been proved wrong.Not very movies are there whose installments live up to there previous ones. But this one did. Sly performed well. I was literally reminded of his power packed performance as John Rambo. When he fought in the climax of this movie.I don't care about critics and you guys shouldn't too, if you really loved to see Sly in action in the past then go and see his movie.

249,DeuceWild_77,Stallone goes full Charles Bronson mode against a bunch of mexican human traffickers in the most selvatic Rambo film !!,7,1 October 2019,"Let me start to say that the version i've watched was the international cut, featuring the prologue before the opening credits, with Rambo saving some unwary tourists from a flood. The American released version cut off the prologue for lenght and pacing reasons, but i think it's necesseary to re-establish the character. John J. Rambo, retired and living in peace in his old man's horse ranch, situated in Bowie, Arizona, but still kind on active, using his techniques and survival skills to help the local authorities in cases of natural disasters. So, he never really quit...""Rambo - Last Blood"", directed by Adrian Grunberg, the newcomer director that gave Mel Gibson a well deserved comeback in ""Get the Gringo"" ('12) after being his first assistant director in ""Edge of Darkness"" ('10) and ""Apocalypto"" ('06), worked closely with Stallone, who co-wrote the film with Dan Gordon, to put his vision of the now middle-aged character to the big screen.The movie was filmed, edited, photographed and paced like a hybrid between the 'old school' form of 80's actions films and the 'new school' form of flashy editing to please both generations X to Z, but his cleary a movie intended and aimed to the X.It features drama, some introspective insights into the beloved character now into his 70's (John J. Rambo is only a year younger than Sly Stallone himself) and brutal action / violent scenes with no boundaries that seem to upset some 'professional movie critics' that called the movie 'Trump Administration propaganda' and treated Stallone like he was some kind of a dinossaur that fights against his own extintion.Well, those 'professional movie critics' probably know that this movie is called ""Rambo - Last Blood"" or ""Rambo 5"", that means 4 movies about Rambo were made already and the motto was always Rambo fighting enemies of freedom or human rights with a rampage of violence against those who messed with him or his dearest friends... Fortunately, ""Last Blood"" is not an exception to the rule and Rambo goes deep inside the human trafficking ring of young girls in Mexico, in a case that those predators took away the beloved one of the wrong guy...The movie may be slow at the beginning, with or without the prologue, it needed to develop the relationship between Rambo with his father's housekeeper, Maria Beltran (played by the Academy Award Nominee, Adriana Barraza, one of the best mexican actresses performing nowadays) and her grandaughter, Gabriela (Yvette Monreal), who sees Rambo as his surrogate father. Maria and Gabriela are the last two persons in the world that the troubled Vietnam veteran can relate, care and even love and his vendetta against the human traffickers will be the bloodiest, savagely visceral and sadistic of the whole franchise.""Rambo - Last Blood"" was not made to inovate, not in its visuals, neither in its story, it reminds the vigilante movies of the 70's & 80's, most notable the Michael Winner's ""Death Wish"" films starring the legendary Charles Bronson, which Sly is a devoted fan; the grindhouse / exploitation flick, ""Trackdown"" ('76) directed by Richard T. Heffron and starring James Mitchum & Anne Archer and the more recently, ""Taken"" ('08) directed by Pierre Morel and starring Liam Neeson, but who cares ? It's a Rambo film, which means an hour and a half of pure action entertainment and Stallone once again delivered the goods. I was cheering all the time, gave a stand up applause during the end credits when it shows a montage with the previous Rambo films (even if Colonel Sam Trautman played by the late great Richard Crenna should have been included, but maybe his family not optioned it ? Who knows...) and i left the cinema pleased hoping for a ""Last Blood - Part II"".Thank you, Sylvester Stallone !My vote is a 7.5 !!",Rambo - Last Blood
250,domtaylor,This is it. Don't get scared now.,5,19 September 2019,"Stallone is back as the titular hero in the fifth and final (or not, depending on box-office success) entry in the long running 'Rambo' series that began with 'First Blood' in 1982. Here, however, the character doesn't really feel like Rambo at all and the same can be said for the film as a whole. It's just a pretty generic 'revenge thriller' that could have easily been an entry in the 'Taken' series, for example. That's not to say it's bad, though; it's just lacking it's own identity, which obviously heavily limits its memorability. Thankfully it's fairly engaging in its first two acts, and actually has a few unexpected and successful beats in the narrative that make it rather interesting. The characters, while basic, are rather well done here, too, and the actors are decent enough to make you care. There's not a lot of action, though; if that's what you're looking for, you're going to be disappointed for a while. Indeed, the majority of the action comes in the final act and that has been largely given away by the marketing. Surprisingly though, as it reaches this final third, it becomes far less interesting because it becomes far more generic. The action is there but it's edited pretty bizarrely, focussing on single blows without any real flow, and it has a weirdly sadistic edge to it which plays into the film's problem of showing revenge as the only way of solving problems. It's rather violent, too, but it seems to be trying its best to simply be 'edgy' rather than make the audience feel any sense of the pain, and it ends on absolutely absurd final kill that kind of breaks its (already heightened) established realism. It doesn't help that all of the 'bad guys' are Mexicans, either, and that the all-American cowboy is the only guy who can take them down. I don't know if this is intentional, but it's certainly giving a political statement that can't really be ignored. Overall, 'Rambo: Last Blood' is too generic for its own good. It's actually fairly entertaining and surprising in its first two acts, but it gets less interesting as it goes along, and ends on a rather flat note. It's a shame, too, as it has a lot going for it and could have done a lot more with the material. As it stands though, it's fine. 5/10",Rambo - Last Blood

252,kenstallings-65346,Deeper than most will admit,7,20 July 2020,"Stallone wrote a story that was designed to be the coda, and yet, perhaps it will not. After watching this movie, one is left with an empty impression. The movie has intense action, and starts off with a worthy subject. But, if simple revenge is a message, then it was delivered as empty and shallow as such a purpose ultimately always is.Perhaps that's precisely what Stallone was after. To show the void created by senseless death and misery. To show how utterly unsatisfying revenge really is, even when supremely achieved.People have been wanting to write off the Rambo character, and to an extent, Stallone himself. But, what keeps the audience coming is that underneath all the violence and visual impact, there is a psychological analysis at work. There are deeper meanings underlying the obvious plot.There are no uplifting messages here, no social redemption, and certainly nothing to feel good about. What was good and hopeful in character development in this movie is destroyed. All that lasts is the void, and the presentation ends with the character all alone, amid great desolation, no family, no personal connections left alive, and no one left to go home to.As sad as that sounds, it seems this is the message Stallone wanted to deliver, and if so, he achieved it resoundingly. It might well be among the finest movies ever that cared not to provide a meaningful end. And if there is to be another Rambo chapter, the slate almost starts clean.",Rambo - Last Blood

254,maxmages,May Rambo rest in peace,3,10 May 2020,"The opening credits, closing credits and the narration, in contrast to the last film, actually give the feeling that this was planned as a final for Rambo. I think that's good, but the film has absolutely no finality and has given neither the character nor the film series anything.
As if you were adding a page on Romeo and Juliet, another stanza on Mozart's Requiem or the background of the Mona Lisa.God knows the Rambo films are not the non-plus-ultra and apart from the first one you can see everyone as senseless entertainment but even they have their reason for being and are somehow artistic.
And even if those are the best films of all time for someone, a ""Rambo: Last Blood"" will only annoy you and that you still write fat and bold ending has a bad aftertaste.
it would have made a lot more sense to publish all the films in a special gift box and add this montage to the last film in the end credits.
I like the title because now finally the brackets are closed for the first part because the films in the original have really strange titles but I really can't say much about the film.
The Rambo character is a product of its time and of course these are the films, the last one splashes somewhere in between and would be directly forgotten.
If it weren't for the grand finale of this iconic character. At least something has already been brought out cinematically because there is no real happy ending, many characters die and even Rambo is injured more often than I thought (you can see his age and the film works with it)
However, the bottom line is that it only makes things worse.
For me that clearly shows that people have got their heads around and tacked this cheap home front cover that absolutely doesn't match the Rambo character (I would rather have taught younger people like ""Creed"")
Of course there are worse films, but it is more pitiful if you only achieve mediocrity in every respect, even in terms of violence (especially for Rambo)If I were Sylvester Stallone I would develop a special DVD box that would rename the films: First Blood, Second Blood, Third Blood and Last Blood.
the whole thing ends with an assembly and then the row is left forever.

Welcome to the last Rambo film review where Rambo is forced to take on the cartel in the most brutal chapter that almost rivals Rambo 4 brutality.After Rambo four John we see john finally come home to his family ranch, where he spends the rest of his life in peace raise his Niece Gabrielle played by Yvette Monreal, with her mum, While most review will tell you that this doesn't feel like Rambo because he hasn't moved on from the past, the film clearly shows that John is suffering from PTSD and he trying to let go of the past but it difficult for him.Even though Rambo might look old now he still shows that he, not a man to messed with, boy does this film get Brutal especial toward the middle of the 2nd act and the 3rd act holy hell. While you might think that the set just comes out of nowhere it has no real direction, the motive is there and its come with a heartbreaking moment, here where we see john just snap into the Rambo we all know and love.It every word he says you know death is about to be busy because the body count is about to rise. One thing this film shows is just how incredible of an act Stallone is which you only have to look all his film in his career since the 80s, show what a great director he is as well.Action scene and Chorography of the final battle on the Ranch was just incredible to watch, but if you hate the sight of blood, you're gonna hate the third act, as it gets seriously brutal. Got say for the last Rambo film that I grow up watching for the 80s, this was a fitting ending to the series of films that give a great ending and a send-off to the iconic character John Rambo.While ive seen most reviews using the political that it's is culturally insensitive to portray Mexico with drugs and cartel, yes im looking at you IGN, clearly you have no understanding that Mexico is basically run by the Cartel because they fear them, so it's not culturally insensitive to portray reality.Dislikes: The only thing I found was a little pointless was Paz Vega character Carmen Delgado, it's a character that doesn't really go anywhere other than to push the story forward in key places, I think her character should have been writen better to have more involvement with Johnin some way.Just felt like a throw-away character.",Rambo - Last Blood

You get something else entirely. So when an adoptive daughter of Rambo's goes missing in Mexico looking for her dad, and he goes down there to insert himself into the problem, I actually think the entire outcome fits very eloquently with the entirety of the Rambo saga.And what's even more fitting is that in a sort of Taken scenario, Rambo actually does, as we've established, have the skills to do this stuff. Whereas the other movies we have to suspend a lot of disbelief for those characters to pull off the stuff they do. It's actually really a smart direction and brings the character into the modern era in a way that feels more vivid and practical than the last movie.The script is actually good as well! It's better written than most movies of this type. The acting is good, as good as these get. The action was fantastic and built up exceedingly. The ending, as I said, also fitting.

The first obvious thing is the age of the main actor and his mobility, the scenes he is faced with he obviously unable follow taht ritm physicaly. John Rambo from 2008 was a bit close to those first parts, but even then it was obvious that it was actually out of the originality and away from previous more successful films, especially now.

259,pal05052003,Different but not out of character for Rambo,8,25 September 2019,"This installment has a different tone from other Rambo movies. It is not set in a far away Asian country, nor does Stallone's character sport a bandana and a huge gun. This is more like a western, where ' Uncle John' manages a ranch and lives with his niece. When his niece decides to search for her lost father in Mexico and does not return, that is when the story begins. The trailer captures the tone of the movie well and wisely does not reveal much. The first half of the movie seems to drag a bit, and only serves to provide a reason for Rambo to go on rampage. It tries to establish Rambo as still suffering from PTSD and his efforts to be able to save people. To cope, he digs tunnels, and volunteers in rescue work. Despite the runtime, the effort to display Rambo's frailty and humanity fails, and when the action starts, we see Rambo as the one-man army we have known him to be. The actions are great, and literally explosive. There is a lot of blood and gore, yet we understand why Rambo resorts to such such brutal retaliation. In other words, the action does not disappoint at all. Some may comment the movie's villains being Mexicans near the border, but plotwise, where can you find bad guys who are as deadly as any of Rambo's previous enemies. Also Rambo cannot just invade Mexico to rid the country of cartels. However, I am in no position to argue for the director's decision. What I can say is as an action movie, it delivers with tonnes of explosion, and rage-fuelled gore. Yet though I enjoyed it, I still believe that this movie could have been much more epic if they handled Rambo's character better. If they succeeded at highlighting how Rambo struggles with PTSD, and has insecurities about not being able to save people, the climax (great as it is) would be extremely fulfilling. Thus, this conclusion to the franchise serves as a slightly louder than average bang. ... But wait for the post-credit montage. It is worth the watch.",Rambo - Last Blood

265,cappiethadog,War is in the eye of the beholder,1,9 October 2019,"Listen to your uncle John(Sylvester Stallone). If he tells you to stay out of Mexico, heed his warning, and stay out of Mexico. Gabriela(Yvette Monreal), John Rambo's adopted daughter, however, gets word from an old friend, Gizelle(Fenessa Pineda) that she tracked down her biological father. Gabriela's stepfather, you can tell, shared one too many commando stories, because nobody but Rambo's daughter would travel to the most dangerous part of Mexico alone. That's why ""Rambo: Last Blood"" resembles, in form, a horror movie. Gabriela enacts the genre's primary trope: Every decision she makes is the wrong decision, placing herself in a peril of her own making. The bodega is sketchy. Most people in real life would stay in the car and keep on driving. But no, the young girl gets out. It's no wonder that Gabriela isn't kidnapped before she knocks on the door. Her lack of street smarts is remarkable for somebody who lives with a United States Army Special Forces member trained in guerrilla warfare. No gun, no knife, not even a can of mace, and no presence of mind to leave her deceased mother's gold bracelet in the glove compartment; that's Gabriela, who is old school in regard to the action film genre; she's a helpless female. Rambo's daughter knows what her father and Aunt Maria(Adriana Baraza) think about Gizelle, and yet she seeks her friend out for comfort after Miguel(Rick Zinagle), the deadbeat dad, predictably rejects his daughter. Gabriela missed the tension in Gizelle's voice the first time around, and she misses it again. What could possibly go wrong when she invites the young American to an after-hours nightclub teeming with drug lords and pimps?Before Gabriela's unfortunate misadventure, Rambo gives his adopted daughter permission to throw a party in his underground tunnels that lay beneath the farm. The filmmaker, Adrian Grunberg, miscalculates the average modern teenager's idea of what constitutes as cool. The partygoers express awe, not sheer terror, which would be the more apropos reaction, as they enter John Rambo's temple of higher paranoia. Depending on who you are, the threat that Rambo guards against is either real or a manufactured fallacy. Since this ex-Green Beret felt the need to build an intricate network of covered passageways as defense against an impending invasion, his reaction time towards Gabriela's disappearance seems awfully slow for somebody who anticipated that his one-man militia days may not be quite over. Quite possibly, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" is paying homage to John Wayne in ""The Shootist"" vein. This latent western, suggested by the setting, a ranch, and the quintessential cowboy move, riding a horse, becomes more transparent when Gabriela's aunt reports on the girl's whereabouts. ""Rambo: Last Blood"" reframes John Ford's ""The Searchers"" as a meditation on self-reflexivity, in regard to the recent phenomena of political tribalism; both sides. In the 1956 film starring Wayne, the audience of its time, no doubt, arrived at a consensus that Ethan Edwards, a morally ambiguous drifter, should indeed rescue his niece Debbie(Natalie Wood), a kidnapee, whereas Gabriela, one-half of a contemporary audience would note, left the country on her own accord, and, perhaps, believe that she should remain there. A drug cartel enslaves Rambo's daughter along with other girls like her in a hostel, victims all of the sex tourism industry. When John Rambo kills their johns, these girls don't take advantage of their freedom. The circumstances are different, but like Debbie, Ethan's niece, these brainwashed girls have adapted fully to their dangerous surroundings and are more comfortable in the company of the enemy than the hero. Gabriela is the exception; it's a pretty sure bet that she doesn't suffer from Stockholm syndrome. The Martinez brothers, Hugo(Sergio Peris-Mencheta) and Victor(Oscar Janaeda), the cartel's kingpins, turned Gabriela into a junkie, force-feeding hard drugs into her system intravenously. Rambo discovers his niece unconscious. She passes away on the truck-ride back home. John Rambo buries his daughter under a tree. It's an ""Unforgiven"" move. ""Rambo: Last Blood"" may know the words, but not the music. It's nonsensical, because John Rambo, unlike Will Munny, the anti-hero that Clint Eastwood plays in his 1992 Academy-Award-winning film, always fights on the side of the righteous.""It wasn't my war!"" John Rambo, as a younger man, screams at Trautman(Richard Crenna), the war vet's commanding officer, in ""First Blood"", directed by Ted Kotcheff. In 1982, ironically, north and south are Seattle and a small-town called Hope, in Washington state. Rambo fights the sheriff's department because they force him to. More importantly, the fight is an ideological war against a soldier and civilians. In ""Rambo: Last Blood"", because the plot dictates him to, defends his property against intruders from the south, but some moviegoers will see through the escapism inherent in action films as being no ordinary escapism, and scream:""It's not a war!""",Rambo - Last Blood

Whilst I found Rambo IV to also be gratuitous, I did still find it entertaining with an interesting story and certainly way better than the boring Rambo III, but I found very little in this latest entry to redeem it on any level.The politics of this film are very difficult to swallow. Whilst the baddies in this film are particularly abhorrent and thoroughly deserve their violent fate, the cruel way the story unfolds is bad enough, coming across as a 1980s Exterminator/Deathwish hybrid. This film did not need to show such sensational violence to make it's point - that there are some appallingly nasty people in the world and they deserve their comeuppance . It was also not necessary to show in such graphic detail the way the kidnapped teen girl is treated by two dimensional villains. It made an uncomfortable watch to me even if it did (ham-fistedly ) explain the reason for Rambo's rage.The subject matter of forced child prostitution and descent into drug addiction has been covered before in better films. In this regard this film felt like an exploitation film from the grindhouse days of 80s cinema. There was a very right wing touch to this film, demonising Hispanics and making you wish for the violent retribution that is to come their way.I also found some of the dialogue particularly cringeworthy and whilst the last 15 minutes is well staged as Rambo and the cartel face off in a fight to the death, there is very little of any graphic novel type fun to be had here.All in all a very disappointing fifth entry into the franchise and with a very bitter taste. It took some effort for this film to top Rambo III as the worst film of the series but this entry is so dark and unrelenting, and with nothing new to say, that I am definitely not a fan. I am sure some people will disagree with me on my thoughts I know, but this is a film I will be happy to never watch again.",Rambo - Last Blood

Now, to the actual review.First and foremostThere is NOTHING political about this movie. In the slightest. Its a good ol' amazing Rambo Revenge movie. About a man who's after so long, gone through so much horrible war and loss... having found peace. Living on his ranch with who we suspect is his good friend or girlfriend possibly, who has a grandchild. A daughter who'm Rambo considers his own daughter.Lots of bad stuff happens and the film gets insanely brutal. I wont spoil that because I want whoever reads this to go watch the movie. Even if you do it for free for fearing losing money on bad Hollywood films... trust me. Its worth your time. Its a fantastic action film and emotionally impactful as well because of the EXTREMELY well written story. I'll even go as far to compare this film to Logan.Because we see this amazing man, take on the role of a soldier, of a defender ot peace and guardian of those he loves, fight against horrible monster drugdealers and criminals who hurt him in arguably... the most atrocious way we've ever seen across this entire franchise.Rambo has lost friends. Family, even felt like his own country turned on him... but this time he loses something he never even thought he'd have. And to be fair, I'm still on the fence whether or not it was a good idea.It gets really dark...Dont get me wrong, the decision was REALLY brave, really took a strong spine to go this dark, this brutal. The R-Rating is NOT remotely just for show. The are going all out and I'm not just talking in terms of the action. Not remotely.
The choice to hurt John Rambo in such a way... really left me feeling shocked. It hurt, seeing what happened, feeling his pain, if only a fraction of it because we come to care about the characters in this movie.But this is the Rambo Franchise... and everyone gets their fair share of pain. Some more so than others. There are no rainbow coloured happy endings here. Its a grim world. But Rambo pushes forward, much like Rocky.But its sad. Its grim, and sad... and its so damn freaking GOOD.
Its so phenomenally GOOD.There is NOTHING political about this movie. It is a heartfelt, impactful, well written, well acted action filmAnd now that we've established that as well as RT's critics being borderline nuts and should not be trusted... lets talk about the R Rating and the Action shall we?The Action!It starts slow. It fleshes out the characters and some argue its boring and meh because of that. But I entirely disagree because it makes us understand why this happens, it makes every insanely visually spectacular kill so much better when he finally goes full Green Beret. And we feel his pain which is symbolically present in the final kill of the film. Which I wont spoil.We get decapitations, explosions, impaled bodies, nails, axes, shotguns annihilating entire heads, rakes going trough ribcages, more explosions, machinegun fire that turn bodies into swiss cheese, his machete makes a comeback, a freaking M1 Garand blowing holes the size of melons, incinerations, stabbings, more stabbings, throat cuts and stabs, deathrattles galore,""Takes a deep breath""we get house traps where freaking blades slide open mens heads and them falling through the floor unto a few dozen spikes which turn them into practical human needlecussions, arrow fire and probably more that I can't remember right now because there is SO much.
We also see parts of rape, violence against women kidnapped and forced into prostitution, threats that are VERY convincing because John Rambo is freaking scary, and its so good, and we see drugs and needlemarks. Nasty, horrible stuff.And all of it... shows us the grim, ugly, but important to be aware of reality of the world which John Rambo knows extremely well.
We get a grim dark story that the Emperor of Warhammer 40k would come back to life to cheer for. Because it truly is not holding back.And in all its sadness, horrid evil, it gives us a phemomenal revenge story from a character we all love. Expressing his love and pain through fear and anger, as he takes revenge on the monsters that hurt him unlike anyone to date.No thats not hyperbolic. Watch the movie and you'll understand.10 out of 10. Absolute masterpiece. Genuine work of art and after so many sequels I got to say, I am impressed at how the final film turned out so good. Most people would screw it up, forget what made their original film so great ""Coughs Predator & Alien"" ... But not Sylvester Stallone.This is a grand epic finale. A truly heartfelt movie. The Logan of the Rambo Franchise.And what final words do I have to tell the critics who ignore all I've listed and write lies and falsehoods?",Rambo - Last Blood

Think Taken, but with a geriatric old man and the work experience kid writing the script.It's just complete trash. I mean, it's a Rambo film, so you know what it's largely going to be like. First Blood is actually really good. The second and third ones were rubbish, but at least enjoyable 80s rubbish. The last one was pretty bad as well, but at least it tried to have a plot and some action scenes.There's nothing enjoyable in this one at all. Don't even bother with the dvd.

278,TheGreatMarkukini,Which franchise did we just pay respects to?,3,21 February 2020,"I stand tall when saying that ""First Blood"" is a legendary creation and the fourth installment is the bloodiest but still incredibly Ramboish, to be honest I was incredibly interested in what will happen after the ending of the last movie. With all that past behind John's shoulders the ride into the sunset cannot possibly be bland, right? Right?The character of Rambo has been forged in fire and blood. This makes retirement pretty rough as, especially in his case, it is not the first try to escape the horrors of war. I can only imagine what ghosts haunt this ultimate killing machine but even this cannot give a solid explanation on what he has created on his ranch.Anyway we can see that there was an attempt to humanize John Rambo and give him a reason to live peacefully, but then every reason became too rough and exaggerated. I still remember graphic flashes from the fourth movie, but flying limbs and explosions everywhere were part of the show and were kind of justified. Here the dark tones of cruel reality disgust and depress you, the more the better. As the bigger evil John faces the more we will praise his victory.I will not stop on the acting as it has stopped probably 10 percent into the scene. Let's go to the juiciest part, I mean it - juiciest as at some point directors of slasher movies started crying somewhere in the corner. Not once we heard that the dark twisted soul of John Rambo is not out yet only because he does his best to keep a lid on it. But the outcome is worse than I expected. Instead of giving a tribute to one of the manliest and bravest action heroes of all time we wander into a fusion of John Kramer and Kevin Maccalister.I appreciate the desire to give us the last glance at the legend, but after all if I knew that it would be like this I would have taken a mysterious future of John Rambo that my mind have started paining after seeing him walking towards the ranch.",Rambo - Last Blood

280,Willie-12,Serves The Purpose,6,3 December 2019,"First I want to say something regarding the Motion Picture Association of America, and the decisions they make regarding rating classification. Now I know that a film can get an NC-17 rating strictly for violence. And while it does happen, it is not very common. The bottom line is directors usually want to steer clear of the dreaded NC-17 for multiple reasons, the most important of which has to do with economics. It's true, movies rated NC-17 generally do not do well at the box office. There are two main reasons for this. First, a movie slapped with an NC-17 has, by default, limited the number of people who can go see it. Second, there are several theater chains, as well as privately owned movie theaters that simply will not screen NC-17 films. But that is really no excuse for giving a movie an R rating when it should have been NC-17. So, all of that being said, I have to ask this question: How in the world did the theatrical cut of Last Blood not receive an NC-17. It is, quite simply, one of the most gratuitously violent films I have ever seen. Alright...enough about that. So, what did I think about the film itself? To be honest, I thought it was a pretty decent flick. It was effectively taut. There was no need for a long running time (minus the opening production cards and title, as well as the closing credits, it runs a scant 79 minutes or so). Last Blood knows exactly where it's going and it wastes no time in getting to the point. It was about one thing, and one thing only. Rambo going on a rampage born out of and influenced by a powerful desire for vengeance. The entire film leads the audience to an inevitable and predictable, yet quite satisfying and quite bloody battle sequence. Only this time it doesn't occur in a small town and large forest in the Pacific northwest or on a battlefield in some foreign country. No...this time it happens right on the front doorstep of Rambo's very rural home. And with home field advantage, Rambo seems to be more dangerous than ever before. Is this a masterpiece? Absolutely not. Is it a great movie? In my opinion, no. Is it an entertaining film? You bet your a** it is. And in that, it certainly served its purpose. If you are not offended by extreme violence or buckets of blood and carnage, then I recommend Last Blood. It'll keep your attention and it will give you one heck of a ride.",Rambo - Last Blood

Rambo fans will love it, but as someone who only likes the first Rambo film and thinks that the others are pretty bad, I'm just happy that the movie isn't a disaster. It's got action, it has Stallone. That's it and it does well with those things but nothing else. It's fine to stick to the same thing as long as you make it work in someway or if that thing is still just as fun as it was before, but Last Blood isn't really innovative, it's just there.",Rambo - Last Blood

The last 20 minutes or so is a mix between Rambo and Home Alone, a decent 80's action movie inside the crappy movie.
Just do yourself a favour and just watch the last minutes.
For some reason they must have lost the rights to the Rambo music so you get some weird music that at times kind of resembles the Rambo theme songs.

The set up could have been a little bit more fast pace, and get to the point a little bit quicker but it was never boring. Once it got to the action, it was great. Well done and very brutal fight scenes. The final fight scene is like if the saw films were action movies. Also good emotional scenes and a great performance for Sylvester Stallone. He never disappoints. Amazed he is that old and can make the role that believable. Good violent little action movie. One of the best in the series. Good ending. Good movie.

Intense action film and although a little too realistic gory, Stallone is still great as ever, maybe better. I find it typical the critics and movie business itself, pan the film because it tells the truth and embodies all the resolute anger, millions of American feel about the MS-13, Drug and Sex trafficking and betrayals from politicians elected to protect the USA.Hard core reality about sex trafficking. An important Expose.No nonsense Rambo movie.",Rambo - Last Blood
298,liam_nb,Rambo 4 was so much better,4,29 January 2020,"I get the whole movie is supposed to be a last stand so it kind of makes sense it all amounts to a 20 minute siege at the end which would work if the setup wasn't so mediocre and boring, also full of plot holes, like for example why the hell didn't he take Gabriel to that journalist woman who has a doctor friend such an important moment in the movie and I'm just like she didn't have to die you didn't even try and help her you idiot and then then there's the fact they treat the US/Mexico border like it's just a line in the Sand the whole movie but those are minor problems.
The real problem with this movie is just how lane the action is the last scene could have been 20 minutes longer easily it felt rushed as hell and everyone saying it's really brutal and violent obviously didn't watch Rambo 4 it was about as violent as your standard 18 rated movie if less.
There was also some really bad looking CG lasers don't Know why I'm mentioning then buy I am.
In conclusion this movie is pointless no substance nothing Sylvester Stallone does a reasonable performance but that's about it just watch any of the other Rambo movies the 4th one would have made a much greater conclusion to Rambos story like one last hurrah instead if this boring slogfest which only gets a 4/10 because he rips someone's heart out at the end literally.
Also the narration is dumb especially at the end.
Also also I'm dissapointed in Brian Tyler the soundtrack for this movie was pretty bad except for 1 track which is decent if I'm having to pick on the soundtrack that tells you there just isn't enough substance in this movie don't watch it or if you do just skip to the last 20 minutes.",Rambo - Last Blood

I liked his subdued approach, age has caught up with the character but just as much bite!A little slow to start with, but not for too long!Action, good simple plot and good set pieces.A great ending to the franchise, a brilliant movie!",Rambo - Last Blood
301,Beard_Of_Serpico,Unnecessary sequel but still a blast for Stallone fans.,6,13 June 2020,"Even though i enjoyed Last Blood i feel like the franchise could have comfortably ended with Rambo 4. Rambo had just fought in the biggest and most brutal battle of his life and then returned to his family home, it felt like closure.
Last Blood feels like it wasn't originally meant to be a Rambo movie but it's still a hell of a good time for Stallone fans and fans of no bull action movies.Apparently this movie upset some fragile critics who called it a ""Trumpian fantasy"" whatever the hell that is supposed to mean, i wish those losers would stop trying to create drama and controversy where there is none. The fact that the film made back almost twice it's budget in theatres is the sweet icing on the cake.Anyway, this time Rambo is fighting a more personal battle as he attempts to rescue the daughter of a close friend who's been kidnaped by a sex ring in Mexico. Stallone as always nails it as the hard as stone warrior we all love but now he has an almost softer more emotional side to him which i really enjoyed.
The action scenes are insanely violent with heads exploding from shotgun blasts, guys behind impaled on spikes, blown up with claymores, stabbed through various parts of their bodies and burnt to a crisp. It's definitely not for the squeamish but this is a Rambo movie, you don't watch one expecting sunshine, rainbows and tea parties. I mean, the final battle in Rambo 4 was like a level from Gears Of War ffs.
Also Stallone is 73 years old and looks to be in better condition than most men half his age. He is JACKED and is still believable as an unstoppable force of nature.
The story won't win any awards but it also doesn't pretend to be any grander than it needs to be. This is a straight up, grim revenge movie.Most fans of the series have most likely seen it and don't need a recommendation but check this out if you like hard edged action and want a throwback to the glory days of American action movies.Goods stuff.",Rambo - Last Blood

""First Blood"" remains my favorite Sly movie of all time, and justifiably so, but ""Last Blood"" is worth the watch, especially at the end. Grade: B+",Rambo - Last Blood
303,RetroRick,Probably the last in the series. Probably the second best,8,22 November 2019,"Although the format has changed somewhat, this is probably my second favourite Rambo movie after the seminal First Blood of course. It's not going to change your world, but it's a great movie that delivers what you expect, and it's a pleasure to be in the company of John Rambo one more time, not least because in this day of much diminished leading men, & absent heroes, it's not at all clear that there will be anything to replace his like.It's not the first time Rambo's been in retirement, but this time he really is on pension, visibly older, looking lean & grizzly for sure but still like he's in his twilight years. There are old guys out there though that you'd be silly to mess with & Sylvester Stallone despite his evident ageing still looks like he's one of them; still looks like he might just break you in half if you find yourself on the wrong side of God in heaven.In this film, unsurprisingly, Rambo becoming the avenging angel sent to destroy a an evil cartel. By all accounts that's not a task that's humanly possible for one man, but the thing is the way the film sets this up does a pretty good job of making it real & believable. Rambo here isn't immortal, or even the super-soldier we've known in the past. Indeed as the first half makes clear, he's no longer even a soldier, but a civilian; someone's who's settled down with people he cares for, and which have provided for him a family to care for & be cared for.Without giving more away that's what makes the film work. It's a very believable scenario for the most part & it takes the best part of the film for the soldier we know to return to us as the angel of judgement & death that he has become.This is Last Blood, & it's likely the last time we'll see John Rambo on the silver screen. It's not impossible he'll return but at his age it seems likely. An 80 year old action hero breaking the bodies of bad guys in their twenties? Who knows, but I doubt it. Either way I hope they don't replace him with some pale copy.Enjoy the outing. It's fun & involving.Just a Rambo film, but a good one in my opinion",Rambo - Last Blood

But it wasn't, it was weird, the effects, the settings, the dialogue, it all seemed very B-Movie, were there budgetary restrictions or something? Despite that I figured it could still be good, but no, it just got worse, a terrible script, pointless things happening, stupid situations happening, and an end battle that really didn't make sense, the enemy changed from a group of Mexican criminals to some delta force hit squad type thing, very odd.And I really don't get what the kid even died of?",Rambo - Last Blood

307,Exiled_Universe,Best Rambo movie I've ever seen and this is the first one!,10,22 December 2019,"Honestly I loved every single thing about this movie, there is just so many things I love so I will describe all of it. First off I have never seen any Rambo movies ever and this is my first one. Also something that blew me away is that they used the song icy narco link in it and that song is so underated and I feel like I'm the only one who listens to it so when I heard I felt like I was in a dream so basically is it wasn't for that the movie would have been a 9 out of 10 rather than a 10 out of 10. Now the plot of the movie has been used before in movies like taken and acts of violence but this one has a realistic take on such as the acting and the dark and gritty feel of the whole story thanks so Sylvester Stallone's job and he is a really good actor so I loved every thing he did. Something that's not bad but I noticed is that in the trailer the whole trailer revolves around just one scene which is the ending which lasts only about 10 mins or less and in the trailer they don't really show anything else well at least in the red band trailer they don't so basically in the red band trailer they just cram all the good parts of that scene into one red band trailer but that's why it's red band I guess lol they would just add the bloody parts. Onto that now, the gore is amazing and it was so cool as well as all the fight scenes they were all so cool. My parents loved it and I loved it as well so yeah great movie and it was way way better than I expected.",Rambo - Last Blood
308,Colbridge,It's an ultra violent by the numbers revenge flick that cheapens Stallone's creation,4,13 June 2021,"The fifth instalment in the Rambo franchise is a complete disappointment and above all totally unnecessary. It's an ultra violent by the numbers revenge flick that cheapens Stallone's creation and makes no attempt to explore the character who, after suffering from PTSD, has been isolating himself on the family ranch for many years to live a more peaceful life.The film fails to reconnect the audience with the John Rambo character and we don't really care when his niece ignores his advice and predictably runs away to Mexico to find her long lost father only to be kidnapped, drugged and trafficked into prostitution. It's a lazy plot device where he has to once again take the law into his own hands and dish out his version of justice to those who do wrong.We should be rooting for Rambo to dispense with the bad guys as we did in previous films but being set in a more contemporary setting instead of a war torn jungle it's more akin to a Death Wish movie than a gung-ho action film. All we are left with is a dumbed down version that thinks visceral violence is enough to satisfy an audience and consequently brings the franchise to an all-time low.Stallone should have gone back to the source material and listened to original author David Morrell who had other ideas for the character but instead ignored his advice, penned his own story and finished up with a weak script, a one note performance and an unfitting finale that just leaves a nasty taste in your mouth.",Rambo - Last Blood

Not only was the action of the movie outstanding & down to the true Rambo ways but the emotions is thrown in every direction unexpected & nearly hard to control; even still to this moment.
Sylvester Stallone is one badass actor & earned every bit of love from his fans. This just brought the bar up so high for me its going to be hard to surpass. Yes I HIGHLY suggest this movie!

312,iceman88869,Almost did not feel like Rambo,5,25 November 2019,"Truly this movie kind of bored me up till toward the last part of the movie. The story is pretty mediocre. You don't get the feeling that Rambo and the young girl really bonded over the years. They say the words, but you don't see/feel a bond between them. In fact, Stallone's current version of Rambo does not even act like how you would expect Rambo to be. I felt the same about the last Rambo movie.I don't think Rambo would have short cut hair. I could even see him growing a beard. I could see him on a ranch, but not with some women cleaning it for him or staying there for any reason. He would end up a loner. A recluse. Single. If he seen someone in trouble, he would help. That is how I see Rambo in his later years. Not what Stallone has him depicted as in this movie. It just felt like an action movie... Toward the end of the movie, but it never felt like a Rambo movie.",Rambo - Last Blood

But it certainly wasn't terrible. As with any Rambo movie you don't go in expecting realistic stuff, oscar acting or deep stories. It is what it is, Rambo.So why a 7 only? Most of it was predictable. One scene later in the film was a bit overboard and silly looking with what Rambo did to someone. Also the end really could have been better.",Rambo - Last Blood

I liked the movie a lot and loved how it had more dialogue in the first half and built up to a crazy second half. My favorite will always be first blood, the very first one, then Rambo 2, then 3, then 4 and lastly this one. Don't get me wrong, I still loved this one. Sly still has it at 73 years of age.

316,FixedYourEnding,Good action movie but was expecting more.,7,2 December 2019,"Wow, Rambo! one of the greatest icons of the 80's, possibly right behind Rocky, replayed by the ageless Stallone (73). To me, a disappointing story line, kidnapped girl for trafficking which has been done a dozen times before (""Taken"", ""Trade"") however the performance from Stallone is still good, he is still the dark, slow-talking character we used to love.The film is a bit gory at times, for no good reason really, but enough to earn it the 'R' rating. It is a fairly straight-forward timeline with nothing surprising or unexpected, it is a shame the director did not build more around the Rambo character and franchise. Go watch it, but please not before you watched Rambo first blood 1, 2 and 3 which are all better than this one.

You feel like you're watching Rambo for the last 15 minutes. The subject of the movie is a simple, ordinary theme of revenge. I watched it to the end just because of the Rambo name and Stallone. If the movie comes out with a different name, a different actress, believe me, you don't even expect that last 15 minutes. Nevertheless, let's say a movie can be watched for the sake of the Rambo legend.",Rambo - Last Blood

It was mostly waiting for the part where Rambo would get revenge, and when he finally does it's ten minutes of the worst death scenes.

There was too much gore for my liking.Unlike his other films this story had purpose and it was serious. A man taken over the edge, unlike the first film where he never killed anyone. In this one it's totally opposite.Get Rambo, John Wick and Riley North in a room together they could be a impossible force. They are all very tactical in their methods.So for Last Blood, this could be his last? Never say never. Mmm didn't Riley North take on a whole cartel as well?",Rambo - Last Blood

321,omkar1984,Nostalgia ruined!!!,3,21 September 2019,"After 'Rambo 4', I was happy that the Rambo spirit was still very much alive and was eagerly waiting for the next(probably final) instalment. With this movie, millions of fans like me are left devastated. While it's acceptable that the screenplay and the action wouldn't be as sound as the earlier ones(given the era and Stallone's advanced age), it's unacceptable that it's so lame. Let's ignore the fundamental mistakes but how can one digest:
1. 90 minutes??? You gotta be kidding!!! Should have been at least 120 minutes, even more as this would be Stallone's last Rambo movie.
2. John leaves for Mexico without any preps, with just a pistol. Then, simply walks(is allowed and is dumb enough!) up to the mob boss and demands her to be released. Recall how cocksure he's about the conditions across the border?
3. Except the climax, the action scenes are too less to be sufficient. Even the climax is hasty and half-baked. Rambo's planning is shown barely for 2 minutes
4. I don't recall that in any of the previous installments, Rambo talks about revenge. This is a major psychological shift and they haven't given any time to portray this!The background score is remnant of the previous ones, hardly noticeable. Makeup is awful, so are(is!) Rambo's costumes. Except a couple of noticeable dialogues, the rest are worse than a primary school play!Overall, this movie has taken for granted the loyalty and commitment of the Rambo fans. They have ruined the nostalgic value and cherished times of the gigantic fan base!!! I earnestly wish that they shutdown this franchise and let the fans dwell on the glorious past, rather than subjecting them to such a disastrous movie!!!",Rambo - Last Blood
322,teutonfirst,Of course the critics are offended,6,1 October 2019,"Rambo franchise was always pummeled by the critics, because reasons... But this one in particularly does not rise up to the precedents movies. There war a few holes in the plot. The Mexican woman should have inform Rambo where the bad guys keep the girls and save his daughter in the process, but no, she had to watch him hitting the bottom and join her ""drama"" club before sharing information. Second the tunnels... Rambo is physically present at every god dam trap to finish the unfortunate intruder, almost at the same time even the traps were on different branch of the tunnels, meh. Action is great, cruel as it had been and should be, but those flaws were a downer for me. A long stretch to teach girls to listen to their papa.",Rambo - Last Blood

We had watched all the other installments many years ago and First Blood was a firm favourite for both of us.
Well this isn't a firm favourite for me I thought the movie was terrible, badly edited and rushed to get to the usual Rambo violence.

327,warthogjump,Rambo is back!!,10,21 September 2019,"What a movie!! Superb character development in the first half followed by an action packed second half. Definitely not over the top for a Rambo movie in my opinion. I mean it is no doubt violent and I had to look away on occasion due to the brutality of the violence. However, it is also realistic and if one man ever had to take down an army there is no question it would be done just like the way John Rambo did in this movie. The action is very stylish and graphic. There is essentially an epic killing move for each villain which is simply amazing. A movie full of heart which shows all the death Rambo is surrounded by but he must continue to survive by all means in order to exact revenge. A welcome addition to the Rambo movies indeed!",Rambo - Last Blood
328,warthogjump,PTSD at its finest!!,10,27 September 2019,"In Rambo First Blood we got to see Rambo vulnerable due to his ptsd and struggling to adapt to civilian life.In Rambo Last Blood, Rambo appears to have overcome his ptsd and adapted to civilian life. He has a 'niece' he feels like is a daughter due to raising her for many years, he has a good relationship with his caretaker, and he is somewhat at peace at his ranch in the middle of nowhere in Arizona with plenty of tunnels underground because he is a 'crazy man' according to his niece.However, after the Mexican cartel becomes involved in Rambo's life, his ptsd begins to return. At first, Rambo is confused and troubled returning to soldier life, which is evidenced by his initial encounter with the cartel where he appears without a plan and is ambushed and left for dead.Despite his deadly confrontation with the cartel, Rambo returns with nothing to lose and willing to take down any enemy at any cost, and with a much better articulated methodology of taking down the entire Mexican cartel!And the style of execution is wonderful!! Every kill by Rambo is so satisfying, especially the kill on the cartel leader. In this move, Rambo transcends his original difficulty adapting to civilian life, and moves on to showing difficulty maintaining civilian life. Being a soldier is all he knows, and when there is nothing but death that surrounds him, it is also the most satisfying thing for him.Rambo Last Blood is truly a masterpiece. For a man like Sly, aged at 73 making insane hits like this, who created a unique and novel character back in 1982, the ability to showcase both true emotion and action in an explosive adult rated violent bloodshed demonstrates that he is one of the greatest if not the greatest action star to ever live. Well done Stallone!!",Rambo - Last Blood

If you're a seventies kid, then I know you already love John Rambo. Rambo, the name represents the personality of every military soldier out there, once you're trained to save lives and take vengeance then that's what you do. This movie has a lot of action, some of the action is kind of over kill, but it's great. There will be some millennials out there, that want like this movie, but I do. I'm a military vet and can understand this plot, in the military you're trained to serve and protect this country, but family too, that's the silver lining in this storyline to me. I give this movie an A-, I hate that some of our best action heroes are aging, but this was still a good film.

330,ThatMonkey,"Rambo, Bad Blood",4,23 September 2019,"Rambo is a certified classic and the sequel raised the game by telling an equal story about how even with awareness, we turn our back on POW's. The 3rd movie stunk, but that' what happens when Stallone gets too much input on a project. The Rambo reboot was a strong return to the franchise and was everything you could or would expect from the series.
The latest addition, Rambo, Last Blood is a horrible sequel trying too hard to be a version of Taken, wish a kiss of I Spit On Your Grave thrown in, than a Rambo film. The only recognizable talent in the film is Stallone, and the film is full of less than talented actors portraying less than likeable characters.To compensate for this boring lack of originality, this film is injected with hyper violence that honestly came off as laughable. Not only was the violence unrealistic, blood splatter and visual effects looked so digital that it appears it was all done on a Windows XP system.Between this, Escape plan two and Creed 2. Stallone needs to be careful about his projects. When you have an amazing character or film series, you should try not to tarnish the legacy with a desperate film.",Rambo - Last Blood

I was very wrong I am happy to say.Just like the first movie in the series this movie has a very important lesson embedded in a very gritty and entertaining story. I dont wish to include spoilers in this review so i will just say in that regard that the story revolves around the naivety of youth brought up in a secure environment and just not understanding the brutality of the real world and the consequences that can have.This movie is fairly gory which is not normally my thing but in the context of a story looking to highlight the brutal realities it has an important part to play in really bringing that home to the viewer.I have to say this was a great all round movie and if this is indeed the final chapter for the Rambo character I think it really went out with a bang. I strongly recommend going to view this.",Rambo - Last Blood

341,wlee08,I've seen better Rambo movies,3,29 September 2019,"I've enjoyed the other Rambo films, especially the first one, and the others where he is in military fatigues, but this one felt a bit like a 'made for TV' movie. Borrows from Taken (Liam Neeson) for a mostly implausible storyline of Man vs. Sex Traffikers. You can't do these types of storylines without a huge 'creep factor', so you sort of cringe in your seat at the scenes in the underage brothel, the bruised and beaten girls getting their daily heroin injections
And the violence is also pretty disgusting. Wait, what? This is a Rambo movie, of course it's going to be a bloodbath. I knew that going in. But it actually did go too far, if you can believe it - almost like someone felt the need to push the envelope. Would have been nice if they threw a twist or two into the ending, Instead he just picks them off one by one, Roll credits. (The credits, incidentally, are actually pretty good)
What about all the bad guys who didn't follow him down into his maze of booby traps? The ones who stayed up on the farm? And what happened to that journalist? It doesn't matter, don't be a nudnik.

342,darrenbjones,A solid action thriller but this isn't Rambo.,3,8 July 2020,"At only 89 minutes this is the shortest entry in the Rambo franchise and it's a mercy.
This is a highly generic, by the numbers action thriller that could literally have had any action hero type inserted in the lead role. On its own merits it is a decent action thriller, violent and brutal but it just isn't Rambo.
John Rambo was a Vietnam veteran, a humble soldier taken by Colonel Trautman and transformed into a machine of war. He was then abandoned, sent back to a civilisation he was ill equipped to live in and which hated and feared him. Each adventure has been where Rambo has been forced back into the war zones he is desperate to avoid, but perfectly suited to survive, in order to save someone.
In this film John has found some peace, his niece however is kidnapped in Mexico and forced into prostitution. Rambo attempts to rescue her but his efforts just single her out to the cartel and lead to torture, more abuse and ultimately her death. It is at this point that Rambo exacts his revenge in a bloody finale at his ranch.
The film feels unfinished, it feels like it's trying to say more about Rambo, more about sex rings and crime but it never quite manages it. There is no moment of triumph, even his revenge on his enemy feels empty because it won't offer any peace to Rambo and the removal of part of this cartel doesn't solve any issues. We know the vacuum will be filled and things will continue.
Ultimately, in this supposed finale to the Rambo series he saves no one, not even himself.",Rambo - Last Blood

Instead, this movie seemed more like emotional lallygagging and wallowing, and the majority of the film is spent in intense and silted emotional dialogue between Rambo and his niece, or a villain, or the reporter. The dialogue seemed to be lazy and unrealistic, and the characters had no real connection to each other that we could see, beyond that the dialogue 'told' us we should assume. The plot structure was so jarring, given the sudden introduction of extremely violent and unpleasant events after the dragging scenes before. The last battle scene at the very end of the movie did fulfill the expectations of rube-golberg/home alone style bloody antics, but was still not nearly enough to combat the disappointment and boredom from the rest of the film. I will admit that I am not the target audience, nor well versed enough in the Rambo universe to be an expert opinion, but from an objective perspective, this film was a few bad choices shy of a dumpster fire.",Rambo - Last Blood

346,ty-jensen,Disappointing movie,4,20 September 2019,"I was really excited for Rambo: Last Blood since I enjoyed the Rambo movies including Rambo 3. 11 years has passed since the last movie so Rambo 5 should have a good story. Rambo: Last Blood wasn't terrible but it's disappointing.Yeah it's similar to Taken but it's not a rip-off since the script was planned for Rambo 4. Mexican cartels are kidnapping young women in real life, it's been happening for over ten years now. Stallone's buddy Dolph Lundgren was inspired to make Skin Trade which came out in 2014 and I seen it on Netflix Canada.This is the shortest Rambo movie at 89 minutes and you certainly feel it because the story is clunky and rushed. The first act establishes Rambo's relationship with his niece which is nice but it's not enough. Rambo is living a quiet life as a rancher but he still has PTSD which he accepts.The acting is fine, nearly everyone does their job. Stallone phones in his performance despite doing well in the Creed movies and Rambo 4. I guess his reasoning is the script but he could have done better since he has three daughters.There's only three action scenes and only the climax is good. People naturally compared this to Home Alone since it's a classic. Yes, it's brutal but over the top which may feel silly to some. I think everyone agrees this movie was overmarketed.Overall, Rambo: Last Blood was disappointing. It's a generic action movie that easily could of starred Jason Statham or Liam Neeson. It feels like a direct to DVD movie which is appriorate since Millnillieum Films is the studio. If you're a Rambo fan, you'll see this sooner or later and no, I don't want to see another movie. Stallone wants to reboot Cobra and Tango & Cash which I'm fine with, hopefully he won't phone it in.",Rambo - Last Blood
347,fxdx4,A bloody end,7,23 December 2019,"In 2008, Rambo came out and looked to be a fair but forgettable end to the 80s franchise. Yet, in 2019, with a 73 year old Stalon, here comes Last Blood, theoretically the final film. Actually, it came in and out of the theaters so fast I nearly missed it.And this film in many ways is a metaphor for the old style action movies, Stalon is an old and serious warrior, going into one last war, just as last Blood is one last old style action film looking for one last appearance in the box office. In the final credits we see shots from previous films - a M60 being totted in one hand, as Rambo takes out scores of Russian helicopters and soldiers. Now an aging dinosaur looking to stay relevant against a Mexican gang. Ohh had that gang crossed the path of Rambo in the 80s, they may have simply been the pre credit bloodbath. Now however Stalon often sits back powerless as the new world passes him by. Arnie, Willis, Stalon, Segal, VanDamme have all gone from icons to irrelevant. No caps, no snappy sarcastic comeback one liners.As a film, this is darker than it needed to be, Rambo has befriended a family, who runs into trouble with a Mexican gang - really it writes itself, however the cuts to our hero run deep, and there is a genuine sadness we feel for Rambo as the world has passed him by - or almost anyway.The villains could be better scripted, and don't pop like they could. The end 1/3 plays out a bit too cliche.Ultimately, this is a satisfying if somewhat gloomy entry into the Rambo series that ages better than the 80s entries.7/10",Rambo - Last Blood

Much like with Rambo 4, there are no plot twists, no complications, no Hollywood BS. So thank you, Mr. Stallone for telling us this story. It was a pleasure.",Rambo - Last Blood
352,jon-22643,"Bloody, cold, hard Rambo movie, the kind of movies they don't make anymore",10,26 November 2019,"You may have heard some bad reviews on this movie by some critics in the newspaper, ignore them. Yes the Mexicans in the movie are devilish, to some, such cruelty shown in the movie does not really exist, so showing it is racism against Mexicans in general, but sadly such cruelty does exist, and is even worst, in Mexico and other places around the world where crime prospers. So maybe its too explicit, but it's based on reality, for some critics this reality is maybe too much to accept. There is no racism in the movie, just very bad criminals who are doing horrible things to innocent people, and there is Rambo.
Anyways, great performance of Stallone, who gives all he has, some parts in the movie were unexpected at least for me, and hard to watch, so beware this is not the typical action movie although the plot is simple, and you know how it will end more or less. The violence and tension is built slowly but in a growing scale until the climax, you will get stuck to chair the entire movie I promise.
Sadly, they don't make such movies anymore, today most action movies try to bring something new, add plot twists, and entertain, Rambo does not entertain, he bring strict pure primal violence, without excuses, second thoughts, or regrets. There is good and there is evil, and they will clash, and Rambo will to his best to make thing right the only way he knows, the only way he does best, as you may already imagine.
Must watch!",Rambo - Last Blood
353,prolelol,Wow.. I was very impressed with everything about this movie.,10,22 October 2019,"I didn't have a high hope for this movie, but it's actually much, much better than I expected. It's an incredible movie honestly and it deeply moved seeing the final scene as it's last Rambo movie. It's completely different than the first one, but it got a great scenario, brutal killing scenes and a satisfyingly brutal finale. The scene where his niece dies honestly hit me hard.. this was very well-done scene shot. In my opinion, it's like Logan (2017) of the Rambo series. I absolutely loved it!",Rambo - Last Blood

Stallone still has it!,7,3 April 2020,"So Story is a bit cliche for sure, but it's ok, because they pull it off at least.There is the predictable intentional rise in emotions, the motive, there is some decent ""preparation"" montages lol and then the bad guys get their comeuppance!Don't come here expecting to walk away smarter or wiser, or emotionally augmented in any way, but for what it is, a quick ride to justified anger followed by a gratifying vengeance, it does it remarkably well.And Stallone is still a fun, sad/angry sob who goes about killing everything in sight with panache. Makes The One Keanu Wick look like the pansy actor backed by overpowering CGI he is hehe73 years of age. Incredible. Hope I hold together that well!!Gonna miss that guy when he stops making flicks...

357,leonshikto,Rambo is back and hunting preys like natural,7,30 November 2019,"Firstly, this movie just gets the first blood theme of Rambo where he hunts down enemies, in his inventous manners. The story leading to the action is heart-felt and there was an excitement all through the movie. Even when we know Rambo will kill them all, we enjoy how it actually happens over the span of the movie. I loved the original Rambo series and this one is capable of holding up to that bar. Yet, its not the best one in the series but it was good entertainment.According to my rating strategy:

I don't mean to suggest Rambo films ever have a strong plot, but at least they have believable acting mixed with some type of rationale. This movie had none of it.I give it a 5 star because the film has Rambo in the name; I guess that's why it has Rambo in the name.I sincerely hope Mr Stallone doesn't end the Rambo films, they were (still are) so much fun, but maybe at 73 he's lost the ability to spot the trash....and the trench, the huge trench network (you'll see early in the film, so no spoiler), he's been working on the farm 10 years, assuming he did work, he managed to build a massive network, in his spare time... only Rambo would be capable of such a thing (and chuck norris, who wasn't in the film by the way, but could have easily replaced Rambo)",Rambo - Last Blood

He does look ancient, however, and it tugs at ones' heartstrings to think he really IS THAT old. The girl who plays Gabriela, the girl he refers to as his niece, is really cute and she too can either act, or, had a seamless rapport with Stallone which made their scenes together almost flawless.The thing that got me, is how gory the film is. I didn't mind it, but it did surprise me. It's Rambo Last BLOOD after all, so we knew there would be blood, just not as much as there was. The death scenes are well done, if just a tad fantastical, but all in all they satisfy.I really wish IMDB had .5 scores, as this one is a 6.5.

It was sad when the girl dies, and you'de expect some retalliation, but it seems the film here turned to a blood lust horror movie.Gut wrenchingly brutal, uneccesary violence for the sake of gut wrenchingly brutal, uneccesary violence which by the end had no sense of retribution for the girls death.A horrible film and wholly unworthy of the films that came before it",Rambo - Last Blood

They need to find a way to let her die or it's gonna be more embarrasing, and then she really did die...From the start of the film it seems Rambo is having a good, quiet life, the life he always wanted, then all of a sudden the daughter became rebelious and wouldn't listen.

This fifth Rambo has nothing. I was die hard rambo fan but this offers nothing.I didint want genius movie or bright dialogies. I wanted badass moments, effect by camera angle and hard music theme in some moments. Ending is only gore and i enjoyed it but its nothing new, nothing long time satisfying. Final kill is very short one, no ""deep"" fight, no finale. This movie is so lazy, so boring. Nothing in it. Final 15 minutes saves at least something, but the sad part is, this era of movie potencial offers very good effects, yet rambo 3 and 4 was technicaly the best.

It puts the seedy world of human trafficking into the fray - a way to justify the OTT violence, in one scene we see Rambo being beaten to a pulp. In another our antihero rips a bone out of a man's upper chest.For Rambo to end up as a cowboy is just inexplicable. There were so many ways this story could have gone. Rambo should have stayed in the forest and taken on another army... instead of this bucket load of a mess. Don't waste your time.",Rambo - Last Blood
378,stan_gee,RAMBO LAST BLOOD (PLEASE BE THE LAST RAMBO),7,3 December 2019,"What can you honestly say about yet another Rambo movie, that is the question many of us is asking. After watching this movie I give it seven stars, six for action, and one for Stallone, hoping this is his last Rambo Flick!After killing everyone in Vietnam and Cambodia, guess he figured Mexico deserves a shot at his brand and style of justice.For me the script is weak, must have been written by a fourth grader mad at his dad, it's predictable, child ask advice, gets advice, ignore advice, gets into deep, deep Poop, if it were me I never would have followed her to Mexico, she would be on her own for thinking she knew more than everyone else. This method of script writing is old and boring, where are the fresh ideas, if anyone know these morons tell them their script writing SUCKS!For the action in the movie, it's typical Rambo (Stallone) a one man army fighting on his own turf. One man kills every living bad guy in Mexico, so Mexico should be the safest place in the world now that Rambo has wiped everyone out.On a positive note, there was no sappy love scenes or to much drama, since Rambo is always angry at the world, this was just another at the office for him, if his office is in a war zone, the violence is graphic which makes it a good movie to watch, just watching it, you get rid of your own aggression.It you like blood and guts, plenty of stuff that blows up, then I recommend this movie, it would have been better with a plausible story-line. Guess next he'll combine the Expendables with his Escape movies and wrap up his career. Good show (sorta) watch it.",Rambo - Last Blood

380,its-me6611,"Good film, wrong name",7,26 November 2019,"7/10This is not a Rambo film. It's more like Taken meets The Collector(2009).
Plot: John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a war veteran who suffers from PTSD. She has a niece, Gabrielle. One day Gabrielle decides that she wants to see her dad who left her years ago. Uncle John says no because it is dangerous. But she elopes to Mexico to see her father. There she gets abducted by the bad guys. Now John must find and bring Gabrielle home.
Very straight forward film. The film was marketed as an action film. But there is no action till last 15min. But that's okay. Once we make peace with the fact that the producers wanted to use the name of the franchise to bring extra money it turns out to be a decent film.The actress who played Gabrielle is very pretty, even when she is making questionable decisions she does not come across as annoying so that is a plus.One of the best thing about this film is that it is not afraid to show some hardcore stuff that usually we don't get to see from Hollywood. Once the niece is abducted I thought they will do a Taken here but I was wrong. And I am delighted. There was interesting subplot going on with the bad guys. One is the brain other is the muscle but it never got explored.Towards the very end the film changes gear and we see Rambo become The collector and lays trap for the uninvited guests. The action is fast paced, bloody and satisfying.A decent film with good performance. The short run time is a plus.",Rambo - Last Blood
381,SnigBhaumik,For the love of Rambo,7,18 December 2019,"As a fan of John Rambo, I love everything he does. While the First Blood is the all time favorite in this streak, and the 2nd and 3rd installments were equally good, the final two installments haven't done quite a justice for this legendary series.This one is not larger than life like the earlier ones. He is not against an army of soldiers, not as a part of a mission for his country and all. Here he is just a mourning father figure going all out for revenge. Even if so much of killings and bloods, you don't feel repulsive just because of Rambo and Sly. Even at the age of 73, there is nobody who can compete with him in such roles. But as a devotee of the character, you might feel he could be much more than just killing a bunch of drug dealers and women exporters.Even if it is named as Last Blood, I hope it won't be the last outing of one of the greatest action character. The final dialogs of Sly encouraged me too.",Rambo - Last Blood
382,ivo_shandor,Ending on a real whimper with this series,3,28 September 2020,"Rambo: Last Blood is exactly what I thought it was gonna be. Predictable and played out in the safest way possible. Generic villains and a generic plot. From the trailer, you can guess everything that's going to happen in the movie. It has some fun Rambo kills and violence and Sylvester Stallone is all right; he has his moments. The best parts of the movie are the kills, traps and the violence. The movie is okay for what it is, it's not terrible, but nothing special. This is definitely Stallone's last foray into Rambo territory, although it's not the best ending to the character. It doesn't have the best plot points towards the end, but you get some mild amusement from it. By this point nothing seems to matter in the franchise since it's the 5th film. At this point, you just watch them for the violence. It seems to have a more blase ending to the Rambo character, unlike the Rocky movies which are treated with a little more dignity. Other than that, it's safe and predictable and you just watch it to waste 2 hours of your day, even getting some good laughs with the violence. It's worth it to see Rambo just killing more people for fun. It does have some fun 80s action schlock towards the end, and one moment I laughed pretty hard at that's straight out of a movie like Commando. If it was as fun as Commando, it'd be great.",Rambo - Last Blood
383,jamesvass-62316,"It was good, but time wasted on 1st act.",6,20 December 2019,"It was an ok movie overall, it made me wait for the gore, but it was satisfyingly violent... It runs for 96 minutes and seems to be split into 4 acts, with the first 2 using up most of the movie before the action and gore, whilst done well, seemed to be crammed into the last 35mins. This affected the flow and the scenes didn't quiet work. For example, the cartel brothers were the main ""bad guys."" The movie spends considerable time establishing their dynamic. Yet the viewer is denied seeing the killing of one of them entirely? Even though he seemed to be the main antagonist?? Also, the whole storyline arc with that Journalist started and ended without anything happening!?! I kept waiting for her story to have a conclusion, or a reason... But nothing... Oh and what about that awful dad?
I think that, had the script or editor, (not sure where the problem lay), spent less time on acts 1 & 2, and invested in acts 3 & 4, this would have made a considerable difference. But Sly was great as Rambo, and we actually got to see the obvious progress of his characters PTSD and how His past lives continue to weigh heavily on him.",Rambo - Last Blood

387,jadediamond,A Pretty Good Action Flick,8,12 October 2019,"The one thing I like about Arnie and Sly is that they do their best to give their fans what they want even when the critics panned the film. Nothing is spectacular about Rambo: Last Blood but it's a pretty by the numbers action flick. I checked it out because the SJW PC critics panned the movie, so if it annoys them, it usually an indicator, it's a good film. I'm not a fan of Rambo, but I enjoyed this film. It's a simple film about an older subdue Rambo who lives on a ranch and raised a Mexican girl as his daughter after her mother died and her biological father abandons him. She finds out her biological father lives across the border in Mexico and wants to visit him, even though Rambo advises her not to. Like most teenagers who think they know better, she goes across the border to meet her father without Rambo knowing and finds out her father is a jerk. She ends up being betrayed by one of her friends and gets kidnapped and thrown into a sex trafficking ring. As soon as Rambo finds out, he crossed the border to save his daughter. One of the saddest scenes happens which you don't expect in a movie like this, and he goes on a quest to avenge his daughter. I liked how Sly Stallone is respectful of his age now and no longer trying to reclaim his glory days like he does in the Expendable movies. He kicks age appropriate butt for a very fit seventy-year-old and the action gets bloody in the third act like the trailer warns you this movie will be. You already know how the movie ends, but it's a fun ride to watch.The SJW PC are upset because Rambo touched on the sex trafficking happening in Mexico and accused it of being xenophobic when sex trafficking of young women are happening all over the world on every continent. Yet, since they are catering to the Hispanic immigrant population, anything which shows them in a negative light is considered racist and means you're a Trump supporter. It wouldn't have been an outrage if the villain was Russian or North Korean for the 50th million time in the movie or if was talking about sex trafficking in Africa, Asia, or Europe. We have sex trafficking right here in the United States but the liberal media brushes off the Epstein case since many prominent liberals are linked to him. Since his death, the media has practically buried the story like most cases of sex trafficking have been for years. Rambo bravely brings light on the subject and acts as a hero many of these young women wished they had in real life.So if you like Rambo and want an hour and a half of escapism of liberal propaganda, you'll enjoy it even if you're not a Rambo fan. It's a combination of the Rocky Balboa version we first see on screen in Rocky Balboa meets Rambo. Great film for action fans!!!",Rambo - Last Blood

It has lots of action and stabbing and shooting and people getting blown up. If you like that then this movie will entertain you. Just don't expect anything else. Stallone looks like an old saddle bag that fell into a hole filled with sweat and steroids but he still delivers despite his millage. The story is straight-forward and a bit juvenile but it works. I heard that people had issues with Mexicans being ""vilified"" in this movie but the last time I checked, sex-trafficking and drug cartels are actual, significant problems but what do I know? Something, something racism. If I were a big Hollywood executive I probably wouldn't have greenlit this film. I am not so this movie exists. If you like Stallone and you still remember what he used to look like then you might enjoy this movie. I was at least entertained. I hope they don't make any more though.",Rambo - Last Blood

It's called rambo but really had no relation to any other rambo films at all in the slightest.it was more ""taken"" than anything else

But no matter what he has been through, he just stands there and tells you that life is worthy of respect and man's dignity is priceless.Stallone made a lot of films, in recent years to shoot the kamikaze is also very wonderful, but the favorite, is always the first drop of blood series, because rocky diaosi counterattack, special police judge high, only rambo, not victory and defeat, some is only pain, the pain of the country, but also the enemy.

420,imjaredross,A Finale that Fails to Truly Honor it's Hero,6,3 October 2019,"Rambo: Last Blood is the supposedly the final film in the Rambo series. A series that has certainly seen better days. Last Blood's title infers a finale that could wrap the decades old series in a nice little bow and call back to the film that started it all. However, it fails to truly honor its hero in a satisfying way.The first film First Blood seems so tamed compared to this newest entry and looking back the series as a whole has changed along the way. First Blood was a film based on the novel of the same name that followed a man struggling to reenter society after the Vietnam War. It was a topical film showcasing the cruelty and disgust many of our veterans received upon returning home. First Blood was a film with scenes of violence, but it was not an action film. It was as far as I can see an anti war film. Every film after this has failed to understand what this film was about and has opted for a more action heavy series and a violent one at that.Last Blood is First Blood's polar opposite. It relishes in its violence especially in the 3rd act, but at least in this film the reason and motive is clear and can be understood. Last Blood is not concerned with telling the story of a man haunted by war or telling an anti war story. Its focus is on violent revenge and I have to look at it this way. The Rambo series has transformed itself into something completely different from the first film. So, does this work as a revenge thriller?I would say yes in the most simplistic sense. This is the story of a man who wants to live his final years in peace but is called to action once again to protect someone he loves. It's a story we know all too well. However, it has proved an emotionally resonant story in the past. Rambo's story in this film and his goal is simple and it's simple to a fault, but this film is not concerned with its story as much as it is the action this series has become known for.Let's talk about the action. I won't lie it's fun. The third act is insane and over the top and indulges in grotesque violence that will bring out the cave man in all of us. This would be fine, other Stallone movies have indulged in violence before and that's the main selling point. His Expendibles trilogy is a great example, but Last Blood tries for something more and lays the seeds for what should be an emotional crescendo for our John Rambo, but the film doesn't do enough to make this satisfying and so the film ends up feeling unbalanced.Rambo's relationship with his niece is the heart of the film and helps in at least giving an emotional connection the film sorely needs. However, these are about the only characters that have any form of depth. The villains are 1 dimensional and nothing more and are there simply to be part of an endless army for Rambo to mutilate and maim in glorious over the top violence which is fun. The film however has a saving grace in the form of Stallone and his performance. Stallone has always been an underrated actor and I believe it hasn't been until recently that he's been receiving some of the recognition he deserves.The movies problems perhaps are a result of its extremely short length. If anyone knows about the making of this film it was constantly cut down in the editing room to make it 89 minutes, the shortest Rambo film to date. I believe in a longer version of this film lies a film that is much better, that balances out its more meditative moments with its bursts of violence.As it stands the film feels unbalanced and has an extremely slow and boring first two acts that ends on an action packed finale and the the final moments of the film feel like they should be more impactful than they end up being. These last few moments are the best parts of the film and make it feel more like a finale. Perhaps an extended version of the film could be released to fix many of these films short comings, but we'll have to wait and see.Overall, Rambo: Last Blood is a film that has the right stuff to make this finale great, but what is there is either not enough or cut down to reach a certain runtime. Stallone's performance makes it at least worth a watch as it tries it's best to blend the series violent aspects with the more character driven first film.",Rambo - Last Blood

Rambo is now an old man, but that doesn't mean he's forgotten all the training the years have put him through.It's both tragic and poetic. Terrific story telling in a way only Sylvestor seems capable of conveying and sincerely he does incredible justice to our much loved tortured character.No matter which version you prefer, Book or movie, Rambo is without doubt a tortured character. So this seriously sad and tragic ending is worthy of being owned by a superb character like the Rambo Sylvestor shows us with the high impact movies.All the movies showed were how an ex Vietnam vet simply wanted to gel back into society, but sadly society has failed him WAY to many levels and this tragic but ever so worthy conclusion highlights yet another issue with our very sad societal system.So many thanks to Slyvestor for this amazing movie. As a fan I loved it. Found it worthy of the Rambo legacy and a fitting conclusion. I guess with Rambo there could be no happy ending but in a way he ends the legacy in a way that fans will both cheer and cry for the loss of our great hero who will never be forgotten.RAMBO.",Rambo - Last Blood
431,SamwiseG,Give Up Sly .... Age has caught up with you,3,25 September 2019,"Just about watchable but, rather like Clint Eastwood in The Mule, Sly just demonstrates that his acting days are at an end....... well OK, some might argue that they never really started, but this really does show that he should stick to directing or producing.
The plot is extremely narrow, and predictable, and Sly's angry scowl seems permanently embossed on his face as if done with Botox. Right at the start we are shown his ranch, and using the very tenuous script we are shown exactly how and where this story will end. The movie also takes an extremely stereotyped and prejudiced position on Mexicans, which actually is quite nauseating ..... but clearly good for the inevitable death and destruction later.

436,jonathanmarklund,Leftovers,3,1 December 2019,"This movie is sloppy.
You can really tell that the editing has been done by several different people. It just lacks co-coherency. There is something wrong with the pacing towards the end, and also the whole subplot about the reporter makes no impact. It's like they had a more fleshed out part for her, but it ended up on the cutting floor.
There are several scenes that could have been removed without interfering with the plot whatsoever, and at the same time it feels like there are several scenes missing that ARE crucial to the plot.Also. This movie doesn't feel like a Rambo movie, because it doesn't sound like a Rambo movie. The themes that Goldsmith wrote for the original movies are not only iconic, they are amazingly good. I dare you not to get goosebumps when you hear those horns.
Instead what we get here is a computer-made boring and generic TV-soundtrack and The Doors.
I agree with the original author: that they could have named this movie 'John Smith' instead of 'John Rambo' and it would have made no difference.Also. It's lacking the action. It's lacking he big guns, it lacking the explosions, it's lacking everything that we got in the early movies.Also, also. It's just weird that all the suddenly he is hung up on the Vietnam war again. It's like this is suppose to be a sequel to the first movie where the second, third and fourth somehow didn't happen. Is this a sequel or a remake? It doesn't seem like the script writers really know either. And whats even worse, is that the don't seem to know what to do with the characters either.
The bad guys are so 2 dimensional it's not even funny. BUT the worst, THE worst thing: Is that Stallone's character is 2-dimensional as well. He was so fleshed out and so believable in Rambo 2008. You could really feel how cynical and tired he was. Stallone did an amazing job acting in that movie and it's one of my favorites movies from the last 20 years.
But this is just bad. And it makes me angry not only that this movie isn't that good, but it makes me angry because it could have been so much better. Brian Tyler can make a good soundtrack, Stallone can write a good script, Stallone can act, the entire team involved in this movie have the potential to make such a great movie and THIS is what they released?As far as I'm concerned, This is not a Rambo movie. It doesn't sound like one, it doesn't feel like one, and I can't see to find John Rambo anywhere in the movie either.",Rambo - Last Blood

I didn't get the Rambo feeling throughout the whole movie, and I grew up with these movies loving them.Only cause of Stallone I give it 6 otherwise its a 5.Goodbye to the Rambo franchise, which started with a surprise, and died out 40 years later.",Rambo - Last Blood
439,stuartpbottomley,An unfitting end for an 80s iconic franchise,1,27 September 2019,They is nothing in this film to give it any merit. With a plot lift mostly from Taken and dire actors working from a dire script with dire direction. It's only plus side which with most movies these days would be a negative is it's short running time. We can only hope sly doesn't resurrect any othe character from his 80s heyday,Rambo - Last Blood

The story is almost nonexistent but what little it has is at best superficial and follows a tried and test formula which demonstrates lazy writing and not story telling ability.With luck this is the end of the franchise as I hope it dies with John Rambo. It's now become an embarrassment.If you have 86 minutes to waste then this is OK but if you having anything better to do I would suggest you do it.

It's the Logan (2017) of the Rambo Series and I was very impressed with everything about this Movie. The best film in the Rambo franchise since First Blood, the curiously titled Rambo: Last Blood injects the heart back into the legendary action franchise, before ripping it out with an awe-inspiring avalanche of violence that re-establishes Sylvester Stallone as an action hero with equal. If on screen kills are an art, that what Last Blood delivers is a masterpiece. A deluge of bloody ferocious brutality, delivered with trademark Sly snarl and thankfully shaky-cam free, the violence of Last Blood more than matches the recent output from other one-man army movies.Suitably excessive in execution and wince inducing in its means, it's the kind of action filmmaking that hardcore fans would especially appreciate. Much like the Creed films, Rambo: Last Blood successfully replicates the heart and spirit of how its franchise operates at the best level. John J. Rambo is back, and the cinematic killing floor is his domain.",Rambo - Last Blood

Afterwards, he was keen to watch the others. Especially First Blood.
Stallone surprises at 73-years old. Yes, he looks a bit jaded, and he decidedly doesn't take his shirt off to ripple those oiled muscles, as they would most probably wobble feebly, not ripple.
But when he unleashes his ""inner darkness"", he makes up for muscle tone with blood and guts. Even my son, desensitized as his generation is, found some of the scenes over-the-top. Wrath has no limits in this geriatric revenge spree. The recipe of Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" and Liam Neeson's ""Taken"" franchise works well.
Stallone actually acts better than I anticipated in this movie. Never too late to learn, I guess.

And now, so many years later, after he decided to return to the US and try to live a normal, quiet rest of his life, you get to see a different and intriguing side of him. A side that suits his story arch perfectly.Needless to say what an iconic character John Rambo is.
Towards Sly portraying him perfectly one last(?) time at 73(!) years old, I have pure respect and I say that I'd trust Rambo with my life even if he was 100 years old! If you're a Rambo fan too, you shouldn't miss the movie for the world. It's raw, dark and purely entertaining.

This looked very cheap, stallone looked like he was 90 years old. Also it was basically a terrible remake of taken. The action doesn't even start until the final 20 minutes of the film. The remaining hour 10 minutes is just his niece getting trafficked and then she dies then he kills all of them. Horrible plot ripoff, horrible execution, horrible soundtrack. This rating these people are giving it is just the biggest lie. ThIs was actually 50 times worse than all those awful superhero films. Like a b movie with a really famous actor",Rambo - Last Blood

He's saving his family members? Where did they come from? In the first Rambo movie, he was a homeless drifter wandering the country after the Vietnam war. In the second movie, he was in prison. In the third movie, he was living at a Buddhist monastery in Thailand. In the fourth movie, he was living in Burma.So how the hell did he find time to have a family in Texas, complete with family photos, and a granddaughter, etc??

But I do agree with many of the reviews that it was a bit slower and that it does not have as much action as previous Rambo films. But I think Stallone was simply being fair to the character and not trying to fool people. Rambo is an older guy; not the alpha male of the 80's. It just doesn't make sense for Rambo to be a one man army and Stallone knew that which is why this Rambo is more subdued. Still, there is some awesome action scenes and intensity. Still, I had fun watching it and you still get cleverly done action scenes that makes sense. Not the best of Rambo series. This definitely is a weak one but it is expected.

461,fjk1138-731-161881,It's Over Johnny,6,4 December 2019,"Oh John Rambo, how I will miss you...I had high hopes for this film, never expecting anything superior but at least in line with the previous films. But the film is rushed, too short, and just plain oddly done in ways that totally contradict the previous movies and the Rambo character himself. The end result is a mixed bag, at best.The film starts out with zero explanation as to why Rambo is on a farm, where it's at, and why he's living there, though anyone halfway paying attention would realize he's in the southwest USA. Seriously, a simple title card or even some minor montage could have explained all of that in a few seconds and better moved the plot along. I don't know why he cares about these characters that he's known for some time now, but we don't have time for that apparently because the plot is going to move along in the next few minutes thanks to crap editing techniques.The only hint that Rambo was a Vietnam vet and suffers from PTSD are some super quick scenes of old photos that he apparently was hiding in his backpack all these years (frames and all?), his collection of guns, knives, medications, occasional war flashbacks, and whatever else is stored in a series of tunnels on the farm (and yes he sleeps down there). Did the farm owner have a problem with him digging all that up? Did he use a backhoe or just a standard issue army shovel because, you know, Rambo can do that all by his lonesome. Again, no explanation whatsoever is given, but he does brush the horses and train them so you know, it's all good. For now, at least.His ""niece"" has a small party in the tunnel with her friends, which seems oddly non-Rambo like from a tactical/defensive standpoint, but it's all a setup for her to discuss wanting to go back to Mexico to meet her a-hole father and try to establish a connection with him. The friends are never seen nor heard from again. There are further minor attempts at doing character development, but they are cut down to the bare bones so much that what is left just feels like a ""best of"" compilation of scenes from another film than anything else. So just accept it and know that it's important because bad things will happen very soon.Naturally, his ""niece"" defies logic/reasoning from Rambo and the lady of the house (her aunt?), and goes on to meet her a-hole father in Mexico only to wind up in a sex trafficking ring that no one saw coming a mile away. Rambo is asked to go rescue her, but by doing so makes some really stupid decisions that are totally against his character.Are his Green Beret skills needing a tune up? I would have thought he could do all this in his sleep. He starts off with some promise (and where I expected things to take off from an action standpoint), but then gets beaten to a pulp and rescued by some stranger who really serves no other purpose but to save him. Rambo gets a concussion, but just sleeps it off and is ready for action again. Just like in real life.Rambo goes back to save the girl again (his badass-ness magically returns, concussion a non-factor apparently) and then saves her, only for her to die on the way home. Rambo buries her on the farm and goes back YET AGAIN, killing much of the sex traffickers, but only after prepping the farm for what will be ""the big showdown"" with said traffickers later, by laying a series of traps that all Green Berets probably do in their spare time.When they finally do catch up to him on the farm, all the traps that Rambo set get put to use - he kills everyone, gets injured in the process, and really kills the last bad guy in a horrible, gory, and oddly satisfying sort of way. The he sits on the porch of the house in a chair and, after a montage of Rambo's actions from previous films (huh what?) gets on a horse and rides away (injuries shminjuries, he'll be fine)...Wow....not what I was expecting at all, though seeing Rambo be a super angry badass was definitely the highlight of this film. It's all a setup for the few action scenes and the big showdown at the end, where obviously all the time was spent making this movie. It all would have worked much better if it allowed the characters to live and breath, and also explain things a bit better. Reviewers slammed Rambo 4 back when it came out, but it has more character depth and explanation of the motivations for why Rambo does what he does than this film by a country mile.Maybe we'll get lucky and a director's cut will come out with a better edit.Until then, it's definitely over Johnny...",Rambo - Last Blood

Rambo 5: MOTIVATED TO KILL 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸Rambo: Last Blood is a hollow, self-contained sequel that manages to be both inconsistent and completely unnecessary for the character. The main plot points are so brief and uninspired that I am not sure why they didn't just cut out the entire first hour and summarize it in a cue card at the beginning. The girl who gets captured is a brand new, unknown, stubborn, and unlikable character made up for this film, essentially so she can be used as a prop to provoke Rambo's rage. This would have been forgivable had the film been honest about not wanting to do the drama and just jumped into the action. Instead we get a half-baked and uninteresting first hour trying to convince us why Rambo should care about her.The film takes a bloodlust angle. Having just watched the first four installments, this is inconsistent to a degree with his character in that it's the only Rambo where he is actually motivated inside himself to go kill-rather than a victim to the system used and exploited for his supersoldier training in a way that places him in a moral dilemma he cannot refuse, like how it always has been with every other Rambo film.Some are calling this MAGA: The Movie. There is a 20-second sequence where John Rambo goes rogue and is crossing the US-Mexico border back into the United States. He stops his truck at a flimsy little wooden fence in a field in the middle of the night, then rams the truck through the fence with ease. He goes on to lure a group of Mexican criminals, rapists, gang members, & murderers across the border to trespass onto his property where he proceeds to gun them down one by one. This film is every xenophobe's fantasy. The final half hour is just a series of deaths the enemies walk right into without any kind of resistance or forethought. Rambo is not challenged whatsoever. It is simply a massacre, like watching an old man slaughter goats.One redeeming quality of this film is the score from Brian Tyler. He takes Rambo's Battle Adagio theme from the previous film and mixes in some A Monster Calls (Fernando Velàzquez) and LOTR (Howard Shore). This song takes place in a memorable scene just before the Trump wall advertisement.Last Blood is legitimately not a good Rambo film. It isn't quite ""pretend it never existed"" bad, but it is quite a step back after the large step forward that was the previous installment.Disappointed.",Rambo - Last Blood

This one feels the least like a Rambo movie, in that it doesn't take place in the heart of a war, or somewhere overseas. Even the first was like a mini war out in boonies of Washington. The conflict in this one is more close to home, more personal. In Last Blood, we find Johnny leading a life of peace in Arizona. But he is soon lured back into action when a girl close to him is kidnapped by the Cartel. Rambo goes commando to go and get her back. Then he kicks ass and blows up...Its A solid enough movie. I didn't find that it quite reached the levels of wonderful over-the-top brutality of the last one, which was all I was hoping for in this movie. But the action is still pretty good. I think the overall film holds up a little better than the last one , the narrative, the filmmaking. I don't know. There really hasn't been a good Rambo movie since 3 in my opinion. At least the last one seemed more like a Rambo film and not a Sylvester Stallone Taken Style action movie with Rambo shoehorned into it...if you like Stallone and the Rambo films, see it. Otherwise its nothing special.",Rambo - Last Blood
482,themightykazoo-30763,I had put it off because of the critics. Now I don't think the critics even watched it,7,21 December 2019,Great movie.

Thank you for still making some films that aren't SJW garbage,Rambo - Last Blood
483,Weirdo-Magnet,Rambo Fan? then you will love it.,7,13 December 2019,"The story wasn't bad. There were actually some really good parts. There were also parts where i kept thinking ""HOW?""
This movie is basically a build up to the end battle, which involves lots of different ways to kill a bad guy. Parts were really gory, which i loved. I even laughed at some of the death scenes because they were so brutal that i found them funny...... because i'm sick....... in the head.
The ""HOW?"" bits were:
When killing the bad guys in the tunnels? How was he always in the right place at the exact right time?
Where the hell did he get that many explosives from?
How is he always able to dodge bullets?
The only other negative was - this movie was so short. It was literally on for 80 minutes, then around 10- 15 minutes of end credits.
But, that aside, i did quite enjoy this movie. Its Rambo so you know what to expect. I am rating this 6.7 but have to round it up to 7.
ENJOY!!!",Rambo - Last Blood

Rambo is a global hero and this movie just seems to want to please the American fans. Drug Lords has been done a million times before. Even by stallone in expendables! So why end one of the greatest action movies on such a predictable and over used plot! The action is great, the fighting is awesome but it doesn't have a final feeling. Rambos return home in the previous was a nice way to end the character. If they knew then they'd be doing another then they should have left that end scene out with him walking home..

The three follow ups were all fine as far as popcorn films go. This latest Rambo was odd though, in the sense that it could have been called something else and just been a generic action film.Then again if they did that they probably wouldn't have sold as many cinema tickets, nor would they have needed Stallone to be in it.As far as this generic action film with a ""Rambo"" sticker on it goes, it was fine.

Then the film turns into Taken 4.....only John Rambo has none of the intelligence and skills required to hunt down his daughters kidnappers. So he proceeds to get his ass handed to him but then is inexplicably set free?????While the ending is the only good part even this is ruined by the ridiculous over the top gore.

Sylvester Stallone's tears were real and everything about his speech made your heart break hearing about his dead comrades. Here he loses a girl whose like a daughter to him, and what do we see? Zip. Barely even changed expression. The girls aunt never cried, never dropped to her knees in grief when Rambo told her not to approach the truck because her niece is in there and it's not pretty. Even his delivery about wanting to rip the heart out of the guy who did this was feeling kind of forced, to me. And the final battle scene was kind of zipped thru without any real drama. Definitely felt like much of this movie was left on the cutting room floor. I have to say my complaints about this are pretty much the exact same I had for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker which I just saw the other day as well. No character development. If Rambo and even the girls aunt can't even shed a tear for their lost niece, why would you think I'm going to? Rambo said the words about being the tortured soul we remember from First Blood, but unlike in First Blood I wasn't really feeling it. I even have to say the 2008 Rambo was probably the second best in this whole series, in my opinion, because Sly made us believe in Rambo's pain. This movie was good but could've been much better, but overall, I do love the series. I'll say First Blood is a perfect 10, Rambo 2008 maybe a 9, Rambo 2&3 and this one get 7's, which is ok, like I said but could've been better.

I have seen all of the other Rambo films, and this one is the most cartoonishly gratuitous one of them all, completely creating a parody of Rambo. Ironically, this seems to be the exact thing that the film is trying to avoid because of the serious tone, particularly the closing credit sequence that desperately wants to convince viewers that this movie possesses a measure of class, and a point. This film possesses neither. And the action falls flat. The final sequence was a boring paint-by-numbers approach to an action set-piece.",Rambo - Last Blood

I am not a Rambo movie fan, this was just something to watch on a Saturday night. But in the end I liked this movie, even though for me it was not a pleasant watch.It's not slick, choreographed, spectacular or witty. It's ugly, dirty, muddy and bloody. It's more like going down into the sewer for a couple of hours. You don't enjoy it, but you learn a thing or two about the underworld.Stallone has nothing witty to say, in fact he says very little. The movie starts off slow, serene, but you just know it's not going to end that way. It's a movie about the extremely unfashionable subject of human trafficking. Stallone is menacing in a way few actors can portray, which they cover up with slickness and glibness. Stallone is not slick or glib, he's just an ugly force in an ugly world.",Rambo - Last Blood

Unsurprisingly things don't go well and Rambo must confront his past and unearth his grim and merciless combat skills to obtain revenge in a (seemingly) final mission.Dark, brutal and extremely graphic, this is a story about revenge, blind vengeance for one too many unwanted grievance.

514,danielbrown-47106,Not a convincing Rambo story,4,6 October 2019,"Rambo is an elite military operative, not an absolute jarhead with dementia and botox like the character portrayed in this film and that's not a personal dig at Stallone, he and all the other actors did their roles well, my bone to pick is with the directors and writers who seemed to be trying too hard to be like the new guys on the block like John Wick, Jason Bourne and Bryan Mills, similar to The Simpsons trying to be more like Family Guy, meanwhile essentially enacting the same storyline of almost every Seagal movie ever made.. made to overdone status after Taken 3 and whatever other action movie grabbed this identical story to work with. I'm astounded at the level of stupidity demonstrated by John Rambo and the other characters in this film.1) Forget double tapping, Rambo is going for quad-triple tapping despite being in an enclosed space without infinite ammo or time to be devoting extra attention to people who've already been killed, who're merely security/mercenary contractors paid to do a job, most of whom had nothing to do with the operation itself. All of this screams amateur rather than elite.2) Why were the mercs employed for this job?, they never had any reason to suspect John Rambo of being anything more than an overcaring father figure to the girl, so maybe one car full of contractors to be sure, but not like 8 in webbing and kevlar with assault riffles.3) Why wasn't John killed from the start after stupidly walking right up to the gangsters door in an area he was completely unfamiliar with? movie cheese is the only answer to that question. The answer he explains to the journalist ""care for the person he's trying to save"" isn't relative because if he really cared he wouldn't have been nearly as stupid, he'd have spent at least a day scoping out the site for its weaknesses and gradually picking off each person standing between him and his niece whilst cleaning up the trail behind him along the way.4) Pointless ending, so he's cleaned up a bunch of contractors that have nothing to do with the cartel whilst the orchestrators of said business are back in Mexico getting their junk sucked whilst sucking on cigars and sniffing charlie. Sure he killed one or two 'big guys', but the show of capturing and inporting/exporting women will go on as usual and ultimately he didn't do much to hinder it or properly avenge the nieces life, so why did the film stop there with him giving in to his gun shot wounds that he's got ample training in treating?5) Do you think he spent the past 10yrs at home preparing that underground labyrinth for all this to happen? I don't since he couldn't have known and since there's no practicality to creating such a maze underground or at least none that he's demonstrated despite those in his last moments I'm simply convinced that this is yet another stupid element to this movie.6) All that said, I felt this movie was too quick on account of it only lightly brushing over everything and rushing to the finish without offering adequate conclusions or closure.. sure a bad selfish man's pumping heart being pulled out of his chest and shown to him was some sort of closure, but what about the rest of the colleagues back in Mexico and the journalist and the crook cops and all the other enslaved girls? he'd be more than capable of saving them if he were a bit smarter..7) He really did make crossing the border illegally look like a piece of cake right?I love the Rambo series but this one was a let down in my opinion, yet I still give it 4 stars because it wasn't unbearable.. just a little bit disappointing.",Rambo - Last Blood
515,decarloj,Rambo needs to be portrayed as more human,4,20 September 2019,"In First Blood, one of Stallones best performances, he played a man damaged by the Vietnam War, who didn't wanna kill anymore, but found himself backed into a corner. Even then he tried to injure people who got in his way, instead of kill. And then he finally has an emotional breakdown in front of his superior officer and we saw John Rambo as a human being. Fast-forward to Last Blood, and Rambo is now a lifeless, cold-blooded terminator who seems to enjoy killing.I suppose if you're a fan of Jason Statham movies you'll enjoy this.

The action scenes are intense, gory and the key world in this rambo is revenge and rage when Rambo lost someone he loved and who he cared so much about.

However, this movie goes way off and has little to do with the main character's actual experience in Vietnam. The only interest Stallone had was his excitement that it actually got a Rated R rating. I think he cared about little else as was obvious by the very gory violence at the end of the movie. And he would have most likely had to have found an illegal way to get into Mexico with a knife and gun as it's doubtful U.S. or Mexican border patrol would not have looked for this in his vehicle and then arrested him. Same with the Mexican sex trafficking gang who came to the U.S. to hunt him down with all kinds of various weapons. Just not believable. Also find it hard to believe that after the numerous bombs he set off on his farm property that a neighbor wouldn't have called the police. The ending was also unbelievable. Here he was shot and thus injured yet he has the strength to get on a horse and ride off into the sunset. Give me a break.",Rambo - Last Blood

The director has dispensed with ancillary artistic concerns and focused esthetic energy on the properly incited and enraged protagonist, and more essentially, on what he does to those who are morally culpable. This flick Rambos with gusto. Get some!",Rambo - Last Blood
534,chris-4711,A fitting end,10,21 September 2019,"Having grown up watching the whole series this, apart from the first, is the best. A reasonable story and slow build up to a great send off for Rambo.The acting was good and the violence was extreme as you would expect from a Rambo movie. The traps were similar to the original movie and nothing really surpised me but the hammer to the nuts of a baddie made me wince.My only gripe was the ending.. It would have been so fitting to see him sit down in the rocking chair and pass away from his injuries knowing that he'd done the right thing and drawing the series to a close.It's hard to believe this all started in 1982..",Rambo - Last Blood

This fifth Rambo movie is not only action packed, but it's a welcome change after the last three movies, in the fact that it's not a war based action movie but rather a traditional revenge movie.I'll keep this short, Rambo (much like Rocky) is one of my favourites of Sylvester Stallone and if you're a fan, then just go and watch it.Ignore the critics, they will find anything to write about these days, if you want to watch a good old fashioned revenge movie with one of the greatest action stars of all time, this is the movie to watch.",Rambo - Last Blood

The gore and violence, not giving in to PC.
The last 30 minutes.What I did not like:The plot was average and rehashed (""Taken"").
The first hour dragged.
Not enough action for a Rambo movie.
In Part 2 he fought the Vietcong, in Part 3 the Russian Army, in Part 4 the Burmese army and in this ... a generic Mexican drug cartel because someone kidnapped the daughter of his maid. Lame.Should have ended with Rambo 4.",Rambo - Last Blood

I was always wondering how the fight between John (the man that killed trained soldiers from all around the globe all his life) and some street people (not army trained) would look. And it's just like that:a massacre.You may like it, but this movie won't deliever the same feeling as the classics. It's much more superficial. It's literally the only movie in which John Rambo wants to kill.A bad ending for a franchise that I'm a big fan of.. I prefer to think it's completely separated from the series.",Rambo - Last Blood
543,karmazyn,"John Rambo Last Blood was a good but unnecessary movie, not with this ending anyway....",7,10 October 2019,"Oh man, John Rambo is back. He is cooler now because he has PTSD and something to live for. Imagine if you try to take this away from him. Do you think he will let you live, after this?
No, you are wrong ! In this latest installment John leaves humid jungles of Vietnam and Burma, he is no longer hiking through dense forests of USA, harsh deserts of Afghanistan are abandoned. John is home, back on his farm. He will venture to Mexico for his next adventure. Here the two movie genres clash and we have Rambo Last Blood. Heavy Taken and Home alone influences shape this movie into decent, watchable yet predictable spectacle.There is not much to be said about it really. John Rambo builds underground tunnels in his spare time, sort of the ones he experienced in Nam. He likes to collect weapons and explore tunnels at night. It is is refuge, the physical representation of his conflicted and scared by war mind.This part of the movie I really liked. Rambo internal struggle with reality and at the same time a gimps of hope. Uncle Rambo looks after the farm and his niece. He lives on the farm with people close to him. His life has meaning again. He is not happy but content with life. He takes his medication and spends his time breeding horses and doing farm stuff. He spends lots of his time with his niece and reflects on life.One night his niece decides to go to Mexico to look for her father. That's how the rampage begins, that's how story unravels. Rambo warned the girl ! Grandma warned the girl but she is young and naive. She wants to find out why her father left her, why? Is it because he did not care about her. How could you not care for your daughter you dirty man. She does not understand that some people like John said had black hearts. They are rotten inside. He begs her not to go but she did and it did not end up well for her. This pure, innocent life was trapped in a cruel world she was not prepared to face. This is very sad part of the story and direction producers took was very cruel to the Rambo's character. He can not even find rest on his farm and the little he has is still taken away from him.He is a very tragic character in my opinion.It is up to Rambo to try to rescue her. John crosses the border and his search for her takes him through the world he does not understand but knows how to tear it apart in order to try to save the girl.Movie final scene was well worth waiting for. It is a shame that movie was not little longer. When Rambo was in his rampage mode the movie finished. I would like to see this momentum going and have 20 minutes more of John, maybe even him returning to Mexico to completely dismantle whole underworld.Rambo was entertaining but I personally liked the way Rambo 4 ended much, much more. He deserved the ending he got and while I found Last Blood entertaining I am really sad for this character. Life did not treat John well and after everything he has been through he deserved a better ending.",Rambo - Last Blood

545,brdavid-429-96270,A Waste of a Rambo Movie. A Waste of a Movie. The 4th Rambo is the legitimate ending.,3,22 March 2020,"Rambo is supposed to be about a man separated from ""the world"". A man who has drifted not just from everyone else but from himself, enough so that he can survive in a world that doesn't want him. Rambo is a solitary man, who eventually finds the moral ground. He is the grim reaper to anyone who stands in his way.This movie is about a guy troubled by his past who happens to be good with traps and explosives. This is not about Rambo, but about some other military guy that could be anyone.The series ended with Rambo 4 and truer to the character tale that pits Rambo against the militia of Burma. In that movie he warns missionaries not to go into the area they wish to go into , but they go anyways. The mercenaries then find the hell they were warned about, and Rambo comes to save the day. It wasn't the best plot but it was definitely more Rambo than this one.Rambo is a guardian for his niece, who wants to go to Mexico to talk to her dad, warned by Rambo not to go, but goes anyways. Rambo then goes in to find her, get captured, beaten, then left for dead. Comes back with a vengeance to kill everyone in the most uneventful finale yet. The 4th installment at the very least gives us something to hate about most of the characters. This Rambo really only concentrates on a few. As for the rest we really don't care and thus it is just canon fodder.This movie adds nothing to the character of Rambo. It adds nothing to the story. It's a waste of space and should be ignored.

And some commenting about racism, xenophbia etc etc. I think the film just want to show how the real world and it shown in many films before.we can predict the story in the beginning of the film.

In effect he used his old enemy's techniques to defeat new ones! Very interesting concept indeed 👍 The 60s music in the tunnel added so much reminiscing from the Vietnam war time warp! 😁The only thing I disliked was Rambo getting roughed up by thugs.

After ,Rambo', a fantastic action movie, now comes ,Last Blood'.The movie tries to get us emotionally involved into the characters and their relationships and that works for the first hour of the film, not always perfectly, but for a Rambo movie its pretty fine. Then the girl dies an John decides to take this from Rambo to Death Wish.
The action is fine but not always good inscenated, the dialoges range between cheesy and unserious. Stallone tries to make this one so hard, brutal and dark, that it ends up to be even quite funny in some moments.What worked wonderful for the fourth (and made him the 2. best after ,First Blood', in my opinion) misses here completely.But, to be fair, the movie is still fun and entertaining to watch.

RATING: 2.9/5You'll be glad to know that there's no sign of Rambo chanting, ""Build that wall"" in this movie. LOL This is definitely not a pro MAGA movie the way some critics would have you believe. People seem to forget that Rambo has killed people all around the world. He's an equal opportunity killer. There's nothing racist about taking out a bunch of Mexicans that deal in human trafficking and prostitution. I mean, the cartel have been generic bad guys in film for decades. People acting all shocked and offended almost speaks to their ignorance of bad guys in film and Rambo movies in general. I don't know what else to tell you. At most, i guess you could get offended that some of the people in Mexico dress like those HOMIES toys they used to sell in the 90s. 🤣Anyways, storywise, this isn't the best Rambo movie. After the last film, he's pretty much settled down on a farm, living with a Mexican niece and her Gramma. Things are pretty slow until the niece decides to go see her absentee father across the border before she finally takes off for college. Rambo and the gramma warn her against it but she goes anyways and winds up getting kidnapped. Once Rambo gets the call that she's been kidnapped, it's time to jump into action and save her.Once in Mexico, it's all pretty generic and by the numbers. There's some story elements that are introduced, like a Mexican journalist, that never really goes anywhere. She only serves to keep the story moving forward and doesn't have any kind of real story arc. I thought she was wasted. You see the police that seem to just stand by and let the bad guys do what they want, implying that they're on the take, but it's never explored. It's weird how many elements don't get fleshed out considering how much exposition the movie feeds you gearing up for the big action sequence in the last 20 minutes of the film. It literally turns into the movie HOME ALONE but with Rambo, and it gets pretty gruesome.Rambo: Last Blood is really just for diehard fans of the character. They know what they're there to see and so does Stallone... kinda. Weird thing is, with a few tweaks to the script here and there, they could have had something with a little more meaning. As is, it's fine. Average at best and that's mainly because the final action sequence drags it into average territory, but i have a feeling that's all some fans need. If they do make a sequel, hopefully they'll put some real thought into it and give Rambo a more proper sendoff.",Rambo - Last Blood
554,bandini2,Magnificent exit for a legend,10,21 September 2019,"Last installment to an American tradition...well maybe. Get ready for a deeper look into John Rambo than we ever got before, even in all of the previous films put together. Finally having come ""full circle"" as Col Troutman had suggested, we see Rambo living a quiet, semi-retired life in the American Southwest, gently working with horses and going about the mundane rhythm of ranch life, repairing things and trying to forge a relationship with a young girl who calls him uncle but, even in this idyllic setting, trouble seems to always find our boy.As the plot thickens and we see Rambo square off against with a new crop of bad guys, we notice that he doesn't value his own life very much. Maybe he never did. Her tales chances, walks right into situations with little regard for his own safety. His body now old and stiff from a life of constant combat seems to have taken a toll but when an innocent loved one is suddenly in terrible danger, an old fire awakens deep inside Rambo that goes past even revenge all the way to blood lust.If you're ever ""taken"" Rambo is the hellhound you want coming after you. The story lacks a happy ending but I can't think of one Rambo that did. God bless this character. Somewhere deep inside, he's who all of us wish we could be.",Rambo - Last Blood

Started ok and thought Stallones acting was on point but after the first 15 mins its just all a bit silly.
Unfortunately they have gone done the road of cliche drug cartel bad guys and stupid plot if you can call it one.
Violence for Violence sake has just become mundane in movies.
The ending was god awful comedy like nonsense and out of Rambos character in my opinion.
Why cater for the masses with crap like this,when you have the masses on side already?
First blood is where it all started and what brought everyone on board in the beginning ,so why go down the road of upping the body count to please brainless morons?
'First blood 'was a masterpiece because it was simple with brilliant characters.

563,hprashantarora,What were they thinking?!,2,27 June 2020,"Rambo: Last Blood - a strange amalgam of ""Taken"" and ""Home Alone,"" and a sorry excuse for an action movie.Do yourself a favor and don't watch the movie; in fact, avoid reading this review if you are prone to retching or descending into fits of fury at having wasted your senses reading about the latest iteration from a movie series (that you once loved) being reduced to the smell of a horses' behind.Rambo, now domesticated, lives a quiet life in the Arizona countryside caring for his horses and two women, who, in turn, provide the normalcy that he had always craved. Being on the farm is dusty, smelly, but at least Rambo has clothes on his back - clean ones. So far, so good. But, Rambo being Rambo, spends his free time digging dimly lit tunnels under his property. For what nefarious purpose? I don't have to tell you.Whereas ""Rambo: First Blood"" had heart, originality; ""Rambo II"" thrived on jingoism, cheesy but great action; ""Rambo III"" saw him fighting the dirty Russians; ""Rambo"" (2008) had shock and awe of the highest degree, ""Rambo: Last Blood"" has...nothing! Rambo is just there, in pictures on the wall, cleaning horses and keeping a lid on his second nature, which if you haven't guessed by now - is to kill, and kill he will. Where? You already know that.What was Mr. Stallone thinking? The latest sequel in the Rambo series is devoid of any soul, substance, surprise, or self-respect. There is gratuitous violence for the sake of gratuitous violence. Why does the world need a mentally scarred, aging white soldier (again) to save civilians from the Mexicans in the most gruesome manner? The answer is simple - to get the audience to pay to watch a botoxed Mr. Stallone (with a weird-looking hairline) play the character of their fantasy a fifth time. The sad part is - John Rambo, a fictional Green Beret and a Vietnam veteran character from David Morrell's novel, a reluctant hero, who can fight his way out of extraordinary circumstances, has been reduced to a John Smith-looking-for-trouble-from-anywhere-town (as pointed out by an equally disappointed David Morrell, the creator of Rambo).From script to direction, cinematography, action, acting, dialogues, everything about this production is atrocious. The fact that Mr. Stallone, a capable screenwriter, and film director himself, chose to be part of this ill-conceived sequel should be reason enough for him to retire from Rambo's character.",Rambo - Last Blood

I will admit it's dark and frankly a disturbing film, you could say a tragedy. Could it be any other way? We are talking about a broken individual, a man who needs to take tranquilisers to 'keep a lid' on his anger and violent tendencies, someone who 'finds killing as easy as breathing' to quote the character. When someone takes his niece (yes, shades of the film 'Taken', with a Rambo edge - literally, no shortage of blades in this film...), you know all Hell is going to break loose, and it does. Although I think the end of the film was a little 'overcooked' and a touch predictable, the vast bulk of the film makes up for that many times over.

Rambo is not in his element here. No military theme. No war in the jungles against military regimes. Rambo doesn't even have his trademark long hair either.It doesn't start getting interesting until the last half-hour of the film takes place.

1. When Gabrielle finds out about her actual father. She obviouly want to track him down and see him. She cannot stop thinking about him why? did he left her and her mother. It doesn't help when she is told of by Rambo and her grandma that she cannot see him or meet him. Everything in the movie could have been avoided if Rambo had just went with her to see her actual father.
2. When she goes and finally meets her father the converstation between them is kind off odd. He starts with compliment her on her looks of her mother then soon as she ask him why left he then turn hostile for seemingly no reason.
3. The cartel that's take her has no reason to be hostile to Rambo when he comes asking for her as he has not seen any of their own operation or what they actually do with the girls and they have not done anything with her jet. They could have let him have her and said you never set foot back in mexico in return. But for no reason they decide to attack him and attack the girl.
4. Yet for no reason they decide not to kill Rambo so when the girl dies form the overdose, this is the decision they will come to regret.
5. Rambo in preparation for revenge decide to go all out in setting up booby traps in style of Kevin McCallister from Home Alone (1&2) for no reason but it must be said the booby traps are awesome.
6. The only thing that happens in the movie for reason is when he decide to bait the Mexico cartel to come and get him, lets face it he could have as easily murdered them there as getting them to come to his home alone game...but hey Home Alone is awesome :)
7. 45 min of cool brutal action sequences where the cartel is murdered one by one by Kevin McCallister and his booby Trapss sorry I meant John Rambo.",Rambo - Last Blood
572,marc2458,One last bloody very very bloddy movie,7,23 September 2019,I'm a Sly Stallone fan and he doesn't dissapoint with that one. It is exactly what I was expecting. An old man seeking revenge in the most possible bloody and violent ways. I want to see an eighty years old rambo still fighting like that.,Rambo - Last Blood
573,milstar,Don't listen majority of high rating reviewers suggest to you,1,26 September 2019,"I admit, I hadn't have my hopes high on this film. To me, Rambo ended after the 3rd part and even that film along the previous film are inferior to 1982 classic original. I wasn't even expect 2008 film to be made, but there it was. Unfortunately, The Last Blood suffers from same problems. And it was insult to the franchise. Fairly ridiculously gory, violent, profane, depraved film with about 80 minutes of screen-time, excluding the end credits (which last for about 10 minutes). The build up is slow, and the it finishes real quick. Story makes no sense either. Also, there are some let's say, cringe pro-wahmen empowerment elements (you would think Rambo movies are allergic to those). In between, there are no any segments that made even 2&3 iconic - no jungle, no waterfall, no helicopters, no bandana... Not a single glimpse of Rambo we use to know from the 80s. Only onslaught of extremely graphic violence. Seriously, this is truly undeserving end for my hero.So, don't listen to what people write here. Actually, if you are fan of 2008 Rambo, you'll probably (maybe) love this one. Otherwise, go look for entertaining movie someplace else.",Rambo - Last Blood
574,sunildaswaney,Average movie,5,25 September 2019,"I went to see this movie purely for nostalgic reasons as I really liked the ""Rambo"" series right from the very first one.Luckily Sylvester respected his age to a point and realized that he could not do those daredevil stunts that he used to do when he was a young man.
He instead used his wits ""Home alone"" style to overpower his opponents.
The script was very basic and the acting by everyone including SS was average at best.

Horrible dialogue abilities and a face only a mother can love.. but he has done it again LOL.. This last installment (and lets hope its the last!) is a very fitting ending of the franchise. He is in his 70s now and done a really good job in this movie. Its a classic Stallone action movie. Story is simple, not original and sometimes down right mediocre LOL.. but done right! The baddies pissed off John and John gloriously kills them all, the end! sniff.. the end.. ""takes a moment to clear the tear in the corner of the eyes"" . Thank you Rambo! It was a lovely ride.",Rambo - Last Blood
576,alex-mott,Anyone else find these 10/10 reviews suspicious?,5,2 December 2019,"The film I saw was nowhere near the 8,9 & 10/10 reviews here. It had the feel of a overly gory 'Taken' script re-written for the Rambo character that originally ran at 2 hours and was then edited for TV. Stallone looked like a lumbering waxwork, it's full of plot holes and has none of the depth or gravitas that even the weakest of the other Rambo films had. A far better conclusion could have easily been made.6/10 at most.",Rambo - Last Blood

580,blakthndr,Have you seen Rambo movies?,9,23 December 2019,"People just can't watch movies as a single movie, someone always has to compare a movie to another one. But to that point, Rambo first blood - there were traps he made in the forest. Rambo first blood part 2 - there were traps and he was also trying to rescue people. Rambo 3 - he goes into a war torn country to rescue someone. Rambo 4 - goes into burma to rescue people. So the comparison of the movie to ""home alone"" or ""taken"" is ridiculous cause traps and rescue were in all the Rambo movies",Rambo - Last Blood
581,rebecca_shaw7,Loved it!,9,28 September 2019,"Ignore the critics. You get exactly what you want out of a Rambo film....action, violence, traps and death! Rambo is on fire! Plus it's done in a believable way (as believable as Rambo can be) considering he's in his 70s. Great story too. It was fast paced and less than 90 minutes long so I was entertained the whole way through.",Rambo - Last Blood
582,6Brothers,Overkill...and...Plenty of body bags.,5,7 June 2020,"I'm not sure why I expected more; maybe that Stallone would grow with age? Basically the movie could have been worse. It starts well, a good storyline of Rambo being a protective father figure. That gave me hope this would be more like the first installment with a decent story, but just like typical Rambo it all blows up. It's good to see once; if fake, unbelievable violence suits you. I did like the ending credits where they showed highlights of the series. Thankfully this is the ""Last Blood"".",Rambo - Last Blood
583,orgrabbit,What a shame,4,26 February 2020,"A derivative plot. The sequels to First Blood had made the character into a cartoon, so hopefully this is truly the end of John Rambo.

That's a lot of racist movies you probably shouldn't watch.)",Rambo - Last Blood

Bit more character development with Rambo suffering PTSD and how he's dealing with it. Plot is very simple but the movie ends spectacularly in a very 'Rambo' style. It is a Rambo movie after all. Be great if Stallone could just do 1 more Rambo!! But this could be the final one unfortunately.",Rambo - Last Blood

586,Charles_Carmichael,"Lots of blood and gory, yet dull",5,20 September 2019,"To date in the cinema we have had some great movies, and some big misses (X-Men: Dark Phoenix, MIB International we are looking at you).Since Rambo First Blood, which was gritty and action and was on the cusp of the big 80's action movies explosion, the remaining movies have, shall we say be polite and say it's been a thin plot to drive the action, and there is nothing wrong with that at all, First Blood Part II was entertaining, as was Part III. 20 Years passed until we got Rambo, story was meh and action was gory yet enjoyable,11 years later we get Rambo: Last Blood and I ask myself where did it go wrong? well the shortest of the series at 89 minutes, a nice plot device family story exposition opening, leading to a very slow burn, bit of action/gore, more exposition, and the run to the end in the last 20 minutes ish, and despite the third act action, it was, well dull and entirely predictable.",Rambo - Last Blood

588,polarity_pictures,8+ For this movie Seriously?,3,19 September 2019,It's a gorefest. The story is lame. The Whole message of the movie is take revenge and kill in the most violent way possible without any reprocussions. Probably took 10 minutes to write this film. Save your money get it when it gets to redbox.,Rambo - Last Blood
589,ambros-710-460987,Why are you throwing dirt to the Rambo legend?,2,6 December 2019,"Last Blood isn't a Rambo-movie. It has nothing to do with the series.
Every Rambo has its own genre. The first is the drama, the second is the romance, the third the comedy and the fourth is the pure actionmovie. The fifth is just a crappy cover of Taken. No philosophy, no honest emotions and even every part of the story is not trustworthy.
And every Rambo has its political aspects. Political aspect here? He hasn't even tried to rescue any of the other girls. Why lure them to Arizona?
Only family?! His family was the army, John Rambo is for sure not a family guy. The Tunnelsystem, built only to destroy it with explosives? He could have killed the mexican mobsters easier with a rocketlauncher and a solid machine gun.",Rambo - Last Blood

592,apostolopouloskostas,Live for nothing or die for something...,8,26 September 2019,Last blood as a film is worth to see especially if you like Rambo. The cartel and Human trafficking is something new but it's ok we didn't expect Rambo climb the mountains or jumping the plane's in that age.Spoilers now: The conclusion of the character for me is that which i expected. A man who live all his life in the war and in the end stays alone . Maybe is his curse to feel how it was to be in a family and lose it from people who figths all this year's. We feel it that Rambo's life could take another direction but both in rambo 2 and in last blood an unexpected death drug him back to the killings.Stallone thank you for giving us this character.I still remember seeing first blood as a kid on tv and now at last blood my hair has change colour...,Rambo - Last Blood

I would like to see what fans are watching when they say 'Don't listen to the critics, if your a Rambo fan you will love it' I'm a Rambo fan and I hated it. The only way I would describe it is Barney from The Expendables doing a Taken movie. The only 'Rambo' about the movie is the music score. Stallone, your a Legend but I can't like them all and this was extremely poor. Possibly could have been a good film if it didn't have the 'Rambo' name attached. Here's to the first Stallone movie that I have rated below a 10/10 🥃 Rambo fans...stick to the original four.",Rambo - Last Blood

Now we have a tunnel rat, that happens to be an upgraded version of Kevin McCallister. Who has a kidnapped niece, so he needs to go Liam Neeson.

It feels like they had to make the final Rambo movie but couldn't figure out how to make him relevant at old age.So let's put niece in trouble, let's put Rambo into revenge mode. Let's just have a long piece of the movie him killing people one by one in different ways. And then it's the end. Why?Why did he have to be an idiot in the first place and just walk up to the bad guys? Why did he have to make it so macho? And in the end why couldn't he just get his revenge then and there in Mexico, why make a huge thing about his home and destroy it, and in the end assuming he died?The monologue in the end tries to justify this but the whole movie just seems like an old guy losing his marbles doing random crap and killing because of killing.

This Rambo has apparently abandoned all brain-power and direct conversation skills for a mealy-mouthed, mush-brained version of himself that walks right into situations like a geriatric drunk horny on poppers.We don't get why Gabriela's dad is a ""bad guy"" outside of his open-and-honest abandonment of her, we don't get why Rambo didn't execute Gizelle, we don't get why Gabriela had to die an easily preventable death, we don't get why he had to draw the fight to himself instead of bringing the fight to the cartel, and we especially don't get why the cartel amasses a small army to go over the border rather than hire sicarios in Arizona. Nope, we get to accept all this stupidity as a part of the ethos of Rambo, rather than the superhuman tactical killing machine we all know and love.Instead, we get someone who's older, slower, yet unnaturally strong enough to pull clavicles out of the skin and twist. The previous sequel gave this franchise a serious boost in the veins, only to have it wasted here as much the Rambo ranch got wasted for a crappy cu chi tunnel set up with weaponry that a veteran from Arizona would be embarrassed to have (also, how was he honestly able to make money off that ranch?

One hour and ten minutes pass before the action starts and the actual action part of the film is under thirty minutes which really disappointed me.I enjoy all the Rambo films but I really cant see myself re-watching this, it is by far the weakest of all the Rambo movies. Its like teh writters looked for a reason to get people to attack John and took over an hour to set this up where as it could have been as simple as an old enemy from the past wants to see John dead.Another sequel from that was not needed and seemed forced and doesn't really have anything to do with the previous movies apart from some clips of the old movies in the credits!",Rambo - Last Blood

Kudos to Sly to still be able to play this character so poignantly and the way we remember him after all these years.After Rambo III i remember talking to my friends in the 90's that what do you think did he return to the states or is he still in Asia.And then in 2008 we got the answer.But since then it's been ok he's back but can he adjust like a normal person and what if something bad happens?And boy it does!
The violence here is way better than all the super-hero crap been shoved at us for years.On it's own a good solid action movie. and if this is the end of the series then it's fitting conclusion.Love you Sly!",Rambo - Last Blood

What a fun way to finish the franchise. It was over the top, ridiculous, gory as hell, and super fun. The story was lacking in a few ways, but you know what? I don't care. I had fun! There was great fun gore! Better on-screen kills than most horror movies this year, so thanks for that!I was laughing out-loud in the theater, which made some people start laughing around me. So that was fun. I love when I can just enjoy a movie, and not care about a good and deep story, and watch bad dudes get killed in a really brutal way. But Sly did good, and Yvette Monreal was a new actress for me, and she did a great job as well.
I am curious of what the future of the franchise could be though due to the footage during the credits. Could we be heading the direction of Creed? I certainly hope so!So, to the naysayers, or those that can't lighten up: shoo. Don't take things so seriously. Yeah, the first Rambo movie is grittier and really a good story, but look at the other ones. They were just fun. And I had fun, and don't care what anyone else things.7/10",Rambo - Last Blood

The first 40 minutes is just boring talking and useless character building.
then something small happens, followed by another 20 minutes of talking.
90% of the movie is talking.
90% of the talking is in Spanish.
the story has absolutely nothing to do with Rambo.
his part could be played by any action hero like Schwarzenegger, Willis, Seagal or whoever.
his background as a bad ass veteran plays no part at all.I gave this movie 5 stars out of 10 just because I respect mr.

The story is believable and one would almost think it was based on real events. Like many other adult men, I was touched by the story and after seeing it, I needed a hug. The plot is almost poetic, but there is a lack of action and violence. There's one thing I do not quite understand. Why does he bury the girl alive when he has just freed her? I hope this will be explained in Rambo Last Blood 2. I hope there will be many more movies in the future - still hope Rambo Vs Dredd becomes a reality.",Rambo - Last Blood

The revenge feels right and you want to cheer each time one of the bad guys meets his end.The movie gets into the story right away, though I wish they had spent a little time on backstory. Five minutes would have done the trick. If you haven't watched other Rambo movies, you're left wondering-what's wrong with this guy?If you understand Rambo's past, the tunnel system and his paranoia over his ""niece"" heading to Mexico to find her father make sense. Yes, there are some serious plot holes but this isn't supposed to be an intellectual film...it's Rambo, after all.Overall, this is a revenge movie.

645,Sabre-El,Decent but not the Rambo most will be expecting,7,21 September 2019,"With the trailers of the movie, most people were expecting a 'Home Alone, but with hacking and slicing'. While the 'hacking and slicing' part is a part of this movie, Home Alone it is not.
The movie is decent, but falls short of what most fans would be expecting. Most would also feel there is not much case for the movie to be made.
The movie starts off slow showing the bond he shares with those he's left with now. We see a part of Rambo we haven't seen before: he seems to have developed a soft area in the heart. It's like Rocky is temporarily there somewhere.
Things pick up midway, and that is where the violence starts. We see Rambo become Rambo the personality and the excitement starts.
The problem of the movie is that the 'Rambo' part of the movie is very less. Parts shot in Mexico seem like they belong in some other action movie and not this franchise. Action is filled with violence and gruesome scenes but everything seems to happen very quickly. Even the last act is so swift that it is all over before the viewers have got themselves ready.
Overall, the direction of the movie seems all over the place.
The good part of the movie is the acting. Sylvester Stallone does a fantastic job once again. His fear-invoking capability hasn't diminished. The side characters were good as well. The movie takes some very bold steps, which do give more weight to the story and the motivations behind the characters. This is where the movie shines.There aren't many throwbacks to the previous movies. As we know from the trailers, there's no mullet, no headband. But there is some good stuff at the end credits which bring in nostalgia.Overall, the movie is alright. Directing is probably where the flaws lie, but acting is good and the story is decent.",Rambo - Last Blood

(Can I call that a genre by now? I hope so. C'mon, they should make it a category at the Academy Awards.) But it's an action flick. Don't look for a complex plot. That's not the goal here.The first Rambo is one of my favorite movies. The sequels, not so much. The actor, Stallone, is mighty. He will be mighty on his goon-dwamed death-bed. The character, Rambo, is a Certified Bad-Ass from the bleedin' days-of-yore. And bad-asses do not fade away, they explode like a six-year-old's C4-birthday cake.This movie is a good run. It is not John Wick level, though others have tried to make that connection. There is mayhem. There is gratuitous violence and brutality. It's the kind of flick where you watch every move of the bad-guys and think to yourself ""You are SO screwed, you cannot avoid it...
I personally think it ramps-up a touch slow. And they clearly worked to give Rambo, a classically disconnected character, a little-bit of humanizing real-world attachments. But just when you think it IS moving too slow, it get's one step darker, and DOES explode like that aforementioned weaponized confection, delivering some top-shelf, hard-core, DIY, Home-Alone-style whoop-ass to wrap things up.I don't think I'm giving anything away. These things are not spoilers, they are reassurances. You knew what you were getting into with this one. I gave it a 7/10 not because it's bad, but because there is better out there.

I loved the movie with its strong use of action sequences but sad that the franchise is over. Although the movie has small length compared to its previous Rambo movie it manages to give the fans a perfect farewell.
I also felt bad about the movie was its lack of dialogue or punch-liners which we fans expected from slys character.

The movie certainly has flaws but those two aren't it. Most of the Mexicans on screen are labelled as villains, same as every single american cop from First Blood are. Some dialogues are cheesy, for one specific scene I'd add a lot more acting/emotion and some cuts were poorly executed; that's all anyone can complain about the movie.
It is a Rambo movie, I paid my ticket to watch him ripping hearts off with bare hands, not to read a bible verse to the villains, hug and forgive them, and I got all I wanted to get. The action scenes are cool and they play in a way where he is Rambo, he's in charge. The story line is so simple that a friend who doesn't speak any English watched it with me and was able to understand what was going on, and that's a bonus, the story covers an universal feeling, love.

I really can't understand why large amounts of cash were thrown towards making this . I've seen better looking cinematography on small independent films. This looked incredibily cheap.' First Blood' was great classic but each film has been a slow decline and now a slow death.

And yet, this new instalment doesn't feel forced, the only thing I missed is a bit more background to the beginning (just a few more minutes, that wouldn't have spoiled the action-value of the overall movie), to show how Rambo has been since we last saw him. We will have bits and pieces, so we can kind-of sort-of put it together, it just felt a bit thin to me.
Back to the movie though: effects and scenes were created with great care, and they definitely look the part...the ones looking for strong action and loud bangs, will be served well. However, that is somewhat expected from the title characters (I didn't think we will watch Rambo in his rose garden, at least); the surprise for me was the drama value of the movie. I didn't feel that this strong since First Blood, and there were a few one-liners (well, Rambo wouldn't chuck out a Shakesperean monologue, would he) which haunted me for days. I didn't see THAT coming. Don't get me wrong, there is still plenty of action (and bad guys will be eliminated in spades, oh yes, very much so), for me it is just an unexpected added value.

He took care Maria and her daughter Gabriella But despite he finally get a beautiful life, his mind never actually at peace. His horror memories keep haunting him. One day, Gabriella left to find his father that left her 10 years ago, only to be abducted by Mexican human trafficking mafia. The next thing, Rambo take this matter into his own hand and make it personal.
Actually this last chapter could be more interesting.The story started in ranch belongs to Rambo's father, and the ranch location near US Mexican border - which also one of Trump's campaign. Gabriella's abduction leads to a human trafficking mafia that should be get a large proportion. Sly try to give the emotional moments from his relationship with a mother and her daughter,but this also didn't go well. The one that really absurd was when he decided to approach Martinez brothers HQ - where the whole human trafficking operation held. What a sloppy crazy- move even for a old man, considering Rambo not just an ordinary old man but a highly trained and experienced war veteran. In the end we can only expect for bloody and brutal retaliation, sounds of human flesh get chopped, scream of death.

In the earlier Rambo films, the revenge and the success of the mission had some suspense.

Too much of family drama in the first 30 minutes and lack of character development are the main causes of disaster.However, one thing I need to appreciate is the last action scenes.

And finally we get to see the brutality of Rambo in the final action sequence with the main villian.Overall, Sylvester needed a better story and more action scenes (I understand he's become old in the film so showing too much action with him would seem unrealistic but still needed a little more being his last Rambo film).",Rambo - Last Blood
686,for_you_jr,Absolutely beyond my expectations!,9,27 September 2019,"I went in expecting something mediocre like expendables. But was surprised with how this Rambo movie didn't disappoint me one bit. In fact i loved it! Once the story is 20-30 minutes in, you can't help but feel what Rambo is feeling, and that is REVENGE!
I did not expect so much gore but OMG, it was so good. Couldn't get enough of the gore.
Highly recommend it to people who like justice served cold.",Rambo - Last Blood
687,Supes909,Ignore the Critics,10,13 December 2019,Critics view point is some what askew from what the rest of us watch and as such can miss lead. Rambo first blood was an excellent book by David Morrel followed by an equally great movie. Last Blood represents the real final chapter and it delivers massivly.The storyline is straight forward but Stallone dons his Rambo persona like an old Lion looking for his last kill. This action revenge thriller gives a satifying end to a saga that started 40 years ago.Don't listen to the critics - watch it for yourself and make up your mind. You will not be disappointed.,Rambo - Last Blood

I would not have been surprised to have seen him using a zimmer frame to move around on, or perhaps a commode on wheels.
Everybody Stallone shoot's dies, he gets shot twice and still run's around, and while I know criminals are stupid I cannot see them being as stupid as portrayed in this film.
And then there was the incomprehensible monologues from Stallone "" I saw death in Nam mumble mumble mumble"".
I read he was thinking of doing more ""Rambo'"" don't is my advice.",Rambo - Last Blood

But after that it's a terrific Rambo style films with lots of blood gore an broken bones. Some scenes may be a little to gross for some but most Rambo fans will be fine with it.

709,brandonsoler-14775,So Awesome!,8,18 December 2019,"I love that Rambo: Last Blood comes full circle with First Blood where we see John Rambo setting up a whole bunch of traps to take out hoards of enemies.The plot is simple, yet delivered with Sly's signature take on the world-weary Vietnam vet. You can feel his rage, self-loathing and depression dripping from every line of dialog.It's what has always set Rambo apart from other Action protagonists. You always feel that he wants to be the better man, and then yet again, the world lets him down, and he unleashes the beast within.The action and violence are intense, but don't feel needless, it shows the intensity of his rage being taken out on an over-confident enemy. It hits you viscerally, that first time you see him blow a guy's head clean off with a sawn-off shotgun is a real ""woah!!"" moment.If you're looking for Shawshank Redemption, this ain't it.

Good action movie, probably deserves a 6.8.",7,29 September 2019,"Loved all the Rambo's movies, the first 3 having been first watched when I was very young (I'm 38 now) due to very relaxed parental supervision in the good old 80s! So it's part of my instilled memories of great childhood movies so looking at Rambo in today's world is with a very different experience. Any chance to see Stallone on the big screen is a must these days as most of my experience of his films have been home viewing . I must say I didnt get a overiding sense that this was the John Rambo that we all know. I know he's older but I don't think the movie as a whole suited the character. I would have loved to have once again delved back into his past, maybe a someone or some event from his military days pulls him back in. It maybe rehashing the other films but with this character that's where I want to see him. I guess there could have been restrictions with budget and the studios not wanting to put their neck out too far on this type of movie. What I wanted was a studio giving Stallone £100 million and saying make the best John Rambo you can. All that said, it's an old school brutal action movie. Stallone is as good as anybody, probably better in pulling this off. Love watching him, love the ends credits which really have made me want to rewatch the whole series. This could be the best way to enjoy this movie, at the end of a Rambo binge watch, would actually be a good contrast to the rest of the series.

I expected so, so, much more.",4,18 April 2021,"This movie had so many flaws and had totally re-arranged the whole story of John Rambo. Major plot holes all over that contradicts the whole Rambo Franchise. To me, I had to pretend that this film doesn't even exist because it totally defeats the whole premise of the Rambo films. Here are just a few major flaws that has no concept of the story of John Rambo: Rambo was a lone wolf, with no family, no friends, just a survivor of war, and knows no other way of life and is scarred mentally. So, they suddenly decide that he has family? Why change the whole plot when that's not even the story of Rambo? Ok, another major flaw is, Rambo would never set himself up to get killed and walk right into that confrontation where, in reality , he would of been killed just like that. Again, that's not Rambo. Rambo has a plan, that won't fail, and would never be foolish enough to just walk into a possible trap. They needed to eliminate the family that he never had, simply because he never had any family - that's Rambo. My writing for this film would involve Rambo hiding out off of the grid and hiding from enemies off war that were hunting him, and he ends up meeting up with a buddy from war whom he thought was dead after all of these years and they both team up for a one final battle of last blood for the finale of the franchise.That's what I would of done.

721,Joshua_Barry,What this could have been..,4,18 September 2019,"After really enjoying my Rambo marathon over the last few days, it's with a heavy heart I write my thoughts on the last film in the series. One way to describe the plot of the film is Home Alone meets Taken.
.
It will always surprise me, when a sequel is made, 11 years on, and there seems to be no time spent on the script. Here's a plot that we've seen so many times before. As I say, most similar to Taken, a daughter (niece) is kidnapped by sex traffickers, and now Dad (Uncle) goes into rescue and revenge mode. In Rambo's revenge tactics he main line of defence is to set up a load of traps for the enemy, and not traps like in First Blood. Like in Home Alone. The way it's shot and the way they are set up, it really does feel similar. I wasn't the only one thinking it in the cinema either.
.
The dialogue is cringworthy for the most part, especially the first half of the film. Not in a good 80's action cheese way either. Just not good. The conversations feel very forced.
.
Through the trailer and probably also in part to the R rating, the film has had a descent amount of hype. Hype that this was going to be 'The Logan of the Rambo films'. Hype that the violence was going to step up a level from Rambo 4 (honestly not sure how that would be possible). Unfortunately it just doesn't live up to it. Not at all. I was so hoping for a violent gritty revenge western, which is what the trailer seemed to promise me. There's a couple of scenes that are worthy, one which kind of starts the action off, but they are few and far between, and only happen sporadically.

What this could have been.. A Logan, Unforgiven, Rambo hybrid would have been so rad. I really want to see that film!",Rambo - Last Blood

I was really looking forward to this one, but it turned out to be the worst of the 5.What I truly don't understand about Stallone, is why he so often chooses not well known directors for movies he stars in. Maybe cause Rambo came from his own productionstudio Balboa productions he wanted to keep costs low, but still... with a great director on board, this could have been so much more. Same goes for the story, which is just a bit thin. It feels like an 80's movie with no big budget. While it just as easily could have been a rocksolid 2019 blockbuster.The first hour is, well... uhm, a setup for the last half hour. Go see for yourself. But in all honesty, the first hour could be skipped.The action is brutal and ""fun"" to watch if you are into hardcore action. Fair enough. But still,when u leave the theatre u are left with this feeling that it all could have been so much better.It's just an actio flick now, not an epic part 5.Then again, after part 1 all drama and character building went overboard.

Rambo 1 & 2 were cult classics, 3 didn't quite match the first two but was still very much a Rambo movie.The next installment many years later was passable at best but did at least give something to the action junkie movie goer.So here we are with Rambo last blood, the title actually has a nice ring to it with a nod towards a full circle of story telling.BUT..... That is about as good as it gets from there on in.Stallone of course is an old man now and maybe Rambo isn't going to be that bandanna wearing machine gun toting killing machine. I do think though anyone can still look at Stallone and see/remember the Rambo of the first two/three movies.Where this movie falls flat on its face is the story telling itself and huge plot holes and why did they do that moments. As pointed out by many the whole daughter rescue story line from the bad Mexican guys who are selling girls on the streets and keeping them in line by drugs and beatings is very ""Taken"". But a revenge movie which this most definitely is, needs some sort of story to that effect I guess.Issue is Rambo's character is nowhere near as complex, the horrors of war and what he has seen and done don't really play any part in how he reacts in this movie or the way he goes about it. When he originally tries to rescue the girl he seems to completely forget any of his military training or that he is a trained killer. By the time he does rescue the girl who is now jacked up on drugs, he doesn't take her to hospital like any person would. No he keeps her in the car to drive her home and guess what she dies on the way back.This of course now sends him into a murderess spin where he finally lures all the bad guys back to his ranch (They just seem to kind of know where they need to go to meet their end) where he has gone full booby trap mode and kills them all off in massive over the top gore death traps and explosions, often still sending rounds of bullets into already decapitated and very obviously dead bad guys just to turn up the gore notch that little bit more.One final heart ripping moment (Literally) and its over.And with that ending you realise that this wasn't anywhere near the send off the character needed. Even as a standalone movie it's trash. And I go back to it again, Rambo the Character was much more than an action hero. He told a story about the affects of war and how the army create killing machines that do eventually break.",Rambo - Last Blood

747,fletchlight,Decent but nonsense,6,27 November 2019,"The movie was overall OK, alot of killing which is stereotypical for a Rambo movie. I just dont understand why Gabrielle suddenly died in the car, it's not like an overdose clocks in 2-3 hours after you've taken the drug, which made the plot a bit thin.",Rambo - Last Blood
748,tcoughlin-36963,Time to retire,2,12 April 2020,"Just like all the new movies, they brag them up and they aren't anything spectacular to watch.

Don't do what the movies do!!!!!.....when you have the chance to kill your enemies, do it because they always come back and will kill you!!!!!

749,johnhandsome-32658,"2nd ""best"" Rambo movie",6,21 September 2019,"What's missing here? To be fair I'm more of a Sly fan than a Rambo fan and for me, I've seen the Rambo movies more out of curiosity. I don't think I've truly enjoyed a Rambo movie since First Blood. A portrait of a troubled Vietnam vet suffering from PTSDThe trailer for this movie was at least inspiring. A character driven Rambo western.
However, the plot and its antagonists were simplistic. The script operates on the basis that certain men are just bad for no reason and that's just not a very interesting premise, but what that type of gravity does do is provide ammunition for Rambo to pulverize the villains without mercy.. and it's highly satisfying to watch.At 90 minutes, even as a non action fan, you're going to be entertained, but don't expect to intellectually impressed... that's a trick Stallone only likes to play every once in a blue moon.To be fair, I would give Rambo 1 an 8, Rambo 2 about 4, Rambo 3 about a 2 and Rambo 4 about a 3. So a six, from me, is pretty good.But hey, at 73, Stallone can still pull off top billing in a big budget action movie. It may not be art, but it sure is amusingly bloody.",Rambo - Last Blood
750,ebmilkyway,Needed more but still good,7,17 May 2020,"I would have liked to see the bad guys get a lot more pain, tortured would've been good. These types of films never really end with satisfying revenge. The opportunity was certainly there.
The story was straight forward and has been done before, by the numbers. However, because it is Stallone playing Rambo, it's easy for me to brush that aside.
The film is short and I would have liked some other characters to meet their end in this, but, overall I was entertained enough to give it an above average rating.",Rambo - Last Blood
751,scottelbert,The closing of a book,4,29 May 2020,"Rambo: Last Blood, Could of been much better in so many ways.

the movie it self is somewhat slow, but made really well, and about 3/4 of it is more about everyone else than John Rambo himself. but the ending is a fitting ending for a glorious saga of films, that many of us grew upon. if you are an old fan, then you want to give it a watch.",Rambo - Last Blood

The beauty of this movie is that it has a simple consistent plot, but on the other hand it has a lot of action scenes with intense violence containing a variety of interesting ideas. The cinematography is good and the scenes are well chosen. What makes the movie even better is that it contains a little drama with it.

However, I'm just not sure that this is a good Rambo movie. I mean, you could have the main character named John Doe and it would still work. They don't need to have Rambo in this movie. In fact they shouldn't. Rambo should be fighting actual wars, not human trafficking cartel. If this weren't a Rambo movie, I would've rated it higher. We don't see Rambo's PTSD, no meaningful reference to the wars he's fought or his past, nothing.

768,bbraddock-49896,Stallone really knows how to rip your heart out,10,20 September 2019,"Growing up watching the Rambo movies in the 80's many times over, I was excited when Rambo returned in 2008. It was a very emotional movie, with Rambo angrier and more brutal than ever.
With the box office success of that film, I've patiently waited for the 5th installment, and here it finally is.
I decided last minute to go see this thing on it's opening night... the theater was nearly 70 percent full. Everyone in anticipation for what will probably be the last chapter in the John Rambo saga.
It's a different Rambo film... no police pushing Rambo out of town. No Russians or Vietnamese to tangle with. This Rambo really, really just wants to live a clam life that perhaps he always wanted. The guy is even on medication to help him stay cool, but, there is the evil in the darkness that wishes to torment an already tormented soul, and that soul is John Rambo.
He seems really content with his new life with his adopted family. He has a beautiful young girl in his life, who calls him Uncle John lovingly. In all honesty, I wouldn't have minded a complete film on the relationship building of the people that are in his life. Just John on the farm with his family. Raising the young girl and seeing her grow into a young lady that will soon be off to college. Rambo is very proud of her, and protecting, but she has a demon in her past too, and it's her father that has left her and moved back to Mexico. As with most children that have been abandoned by their paternal parents, she yearns to see her father and ask him the one question that eats her alive.
""Why did you leave my mother and I?""
A question she soon regrets she ever traveled all the way to Mexico to ask her father. In doing so, she has betrayed her families trust, but Rambo loves her and becomes hell bent to save her from the cartels.
Without giving too much away, when Rambo finally sees her again to save her, it is bittersweet. He has invested his last ten years into this young girl and to see what happens to her, (and in real life) happens to so many human trafficking victims with pull the tears and your heart strings.
When you wipe away the tears, you find a completely unhinged Rambo that takes out the bad guys with a rage like no other. Bare hand bashing, hammers used to break skulls, shotgun blasts, decapitations, knives to just about every part of the human body you can imagine.
How the hell Stallone keeps the action sequences so fresh after nearly 40 years is beyond me.
Is there moments of redundancy in the film, yes, but not overly... and as an action film, a complete 10.
Go for a blood bath of ecstacy and get ready to hold on for one hell of an action packed ride.",Rambo - Last Blood

It was, however, a fairly decent revenge movie, with an aging Rambo that was hard to recognize. The action is all centered towards the end and happens quickly in some tunnels. The rest of the movie was setup and mediocre acting. What I thought immediately after watching the movie was that it was a really depressing version of ""Taken"".",Rambo - Last Blood

The plot has been done before hence my Taken reference and it offered nothing to the Rambo franchise, clearly this movie was made just to cash in on the name.There is plenty of action and blood and guts as you would expect but overall I was left disappointed with the movie as a whole. There is a journalist character who briefly helps Rambo, however there was actually no point in having the character in the movie and the character could easily have been omitted without making any difference to the movie whatsoever.Some things are best left alone and this movie fits into that category.",Rambo - Last Blood

779,derekschroeter,Boring and grotesque,4,6 April 2020,"I feel as though with every Rambo film we slip farther and farther away from the lowly origins of first blood. Alike the Fast and Furious series, this film amps up a particular aspect of the films - in this case the violence. While I did in fact enjoy the 4th film of this franchise, this newest installment is rather disturbing.The portrayal of Mexico as a through and through hellhole led to a home alone style assault where the majority of events are spent in an underground labyrinth. This portion of the film made little sense and was a masochists wet dream.The film culminates in Rambo ripping out the still beating heart of his final nemesis.There's a nearly endless supply of films that I would watch before this one. Go watch first blood.",Rambo - Last Blood
780,ricardoschtiegmokwena,Undeniably Gripping,7,1 July 2020,"Very dramatic and tackles themes of rejection as well as the human will to belong. Human trafficking is a world pandemic and any movie that undertakes that subject is a winner! Stallone sticks to Rambo culture for realism -he is flawed and he is as vulnerable as any human.
The films only let down is the sound score. It was poorly done and makes me miss the old Rambo movies. I found it rather off for an epic Rambo movie, it feels like was watching a series in most parts. Because of that I give it a seven.",Rambo - Last Blood
781,TrustworthyReviews,I love you Sly but .....,4,29 September 2021,"Sylvester Stallone was a hero for me growing up so it pains me to write a negative review because I'm always rooting for him to do well. This film was so bad I couldn't finish watching it and had to throw in the towel. A bit like he tried to do for Apollo Creed in Rocky 4, a film I watched on the cinema back in 1985. Wow I'm starting to feel old.Out of principle and loyalty I'm not going to say anymore than that except to be honest and say that the 4 marks are solely out of love and loyalty for his work over the years. He deserves to start with at least that many marks. Had it been anyone else the marks would have definitely been much lower.I will try to watch it again at some point in the hope that I can find more marks from somewhere because I repeat I love Sylvester Stallone like he's family. You will not find a nicer celebrity in Hollywood. I'd love to see Talia Shire in a good new film too. They're my favourite fictional couple.",Rambo - Last Blood

799,misslydia-79291,A Movie for the Fans,10,21 September 2019,"After going to see Last Blood with my Dad, and really enjoying it, I was curious what other people thought and went to look up reviews. I was happy to see that other fans really liked the movie, and not surprised to see that critics were ripping on it. One critic called it ""xenophobic"" Why? Because it portrays evil people who happen to be Mexican as evil? Or because it shows dangrous cities in Mexico as having a problem with sex trafficing and drugs? One review even said that it didn't show the beautiful scenery that Mexico has to offer; as if every movie involving white criminals makes an effort to show a charming corner shop in the crime ridden neighborhood or the beautiful local parks. Basically the movie isn't politically correct so the critics hate it. Last Blood, like every other Rambo movie, is dark and gritty and the landscape and aesthetic mirror that grittiness. Last Blood isn't trying to make a statement about politics. The Mexican cartel is simply notoriously violent and ruthless which makes them a perfect foe for Rambo. Don't let the critics keep you from going to see the movie.Last Blood is definitely a movie for the fans, as it should be. I think I was one of the only fans in the theater who was under 40 and probably the only female. The main fanbase is men who have been fans since First Blood came out nearly 40 years ago. Those loyal fans deserve an epic, bloody, true to form Rambo film and that's what last Blood is. It changes up the formula a little, being a revenge flick rather than the previous movies about him running from the authorities or rescuing villagers, but it's a formula that suits Rambo well. The movie also does a good job of addressing Rabmo's old age while still having him kick ass. His home alone style horse ranch of horrors is not only reminiscent of First Blood but allows him to hold his own against the entire cartel. But don't worry there is still plenty of up close action where we get to see Rambo go toe to toe with his foes. All in all, it is simply a fun, fan pleasing, action packed revenge thriller, that doesn't try to be something that it isn't. I highly reccomend to any Rambo fan or anyonw looking for just a fun action movie!",Rambo - Last Blood
800,Adil90,Stallone delivers,6,15 March 2020,Growing up with the Rambo-series and Stallone as a childhood hero this follow up is a highly welcomed surprise.

805,ccatben,"Not the biggest fan of blood and gore, but a good finale",4,24 October 2019,"Trigger Warnings: Drugs, Violence, ProstitutionThis is just my opinion of the movie, I respect if you guys don't agree it.On the positive side, I enjoyed how John was letting a single grandmother and her teenage granddaughter in his house and kept them safe. He was willing to go to Mexico to get her back to the house that they're living in, even during the granddaughter had overdosed in their last conversation.Some of the negatives was the bloodshed was way too much in some of the scenes. There was a little bit it of drug use that I didn't really need to see, nor do I care do see it in all of my movies. Even though I'm used to the colorful language, it wasn't necessary, would've been nicer if it was a lot more spread out.",Rambo - Last Blood
806,johannordin1,A meaningless show of violence,3,23 March 2020,"I had high hopes seeing as the film had 6.2  score when I decided to watch it. I can't say I really liked any part of the movie, as Stallone with a kind of standard performance can't carry a film this mediocre.I felt sort of hopeful in the first minutes as I recalled the 2008 soft reboot which actually went above my expectations as I watched it at a later time. This movie is actually what I expected when I sat down to watch the 2008 movie, which was a time of many movies with gratuitous, meaningless over-the-top violence. And to be honest that is what the first movie in the series promised when you read reviews and heard testimonials from viewers, but what was delivered in the '82 film was three dimensional characters with depth, an engaging story with an amount of violence that felt proportional to the way Rambo was being treated and the way his character had been set up. Even when the violence took a turn for the worse and it got over-the-top it was treated as just that.In Rambo: Last blood however it's treated like Rambo just stabs people in the leg and rips their collarbone out every day. The blood effects are like something out of a slasher movie and the bad guys seem to be absolutely flat. The way they're set up as brothers and their relationship being strained had almost no bearing on anything.Any and all set-up was never followed-through: Why are Rambo living with these people on a ranch? What are their relationship? Why is he suddenly into horses? Why does he dig tunnels all over his land? Why is he helping some random people in a flood at the start?There was just nothing of substance anywhere to be found and the movie falls flat in every category, what an absolute waste of an ""ending"".This movie doesn't do the character or the previous films justice at all.",Rambo - Last Blood
807,juniorc-47421,Not Bad.,6,14 December 2019,"Last Blood is not very entertaining until it's last half hour. For a while it seems to be trying to mimic the dramatic elements of First Blood, but it doesn't do that so well because the writing isn't very good. And Stallone mumbles so much in this movie that you almost need subtitles to understand what the hell he's saying. There are also characters that seem completely useless and could have easily been written out of the script. Stallone's acting is actually quite good when he's coherent, but everyone else is just bloody awful. His supporting cast is not nearly as good here as it was in the previous four films. It was a slog getting through the first hour of this film.
But the last half hour or so is what saves the movie. That's what everybody talks about. It's relentless action that is extraordinarily brutal and creative. And Stallone does it so well even at his age. Since the villains are such irredeemable scumbags, the excessive violence is welcome. This is what the tone of the entire film probably should have been--just Rambo beating the hell out of everybody, like First Blood Part 2 and Rambo 3. But if you're a Stallone fan like I am, you'll enjoy it nonetheless.",Rambo - Last Blood

All of Rambo's struggles to be normal come to an end and he goes out in a blaze of glory. This movie was well written and acted. If only Hollywood could get back to making movies as gripping as this vs the PC farces they keep churning out.

For an action movie it does the job at least an hours worth of entertaining action that doesn't slow down when it start. Now I understand it was a bit disturbing and ruthless but that is half the fun. You go to a movie to be entertained and this movie done that for me. Especially the ending where it was home alone and Rambo together it was great. Overall great movie for people to be entertained but not so good on other aspects but still it didn't deserve the criticism it got.,Rambo - Last Blood

Stallone is at his best in RAMBO: LAST BLOOD. There are some great kills, and great Scenes, that you will love, if you are a Rambo Fan, or a Fan of rage filled violence, and creative deaths. The story is great too, despite what some of the Critics are saying. Remember this: Stallone and Trump are good friends, and the Liberal Media and Critics know this, and are just trying to bring the Movie down. From some of the Reviews I read from these so called Critics, it is easy to see, that they never watched the movie. Get out and Watch RAMBO: LAST BLOOD, and Support Movies like this, by getting out to the Movie Theatre, so more movies like this will be Released in the future.

Although it stars Stallone and it carries the title Rambo a Rambo film it isn't.Yes there was the big standoff but that's it. It may as been called Rambo tries to save his adopted daughter!. I expected the a fully armed special forces ""best of the best"" mission from the shadows. Instead it's gun and knife walking in plain sight old man getting his arsed kicked because he was just an old man!. Not too mention his mission failed to rescue his daughter and for some reason the ""bad guys"" crossed into American to exact revenge it makes no sense.Utterly crap movie.

People were trying to label this movie the worst of the series and racist but it's not not at all racist...
Not when you get down to the realism of what is happening in Mexico and not trying to sugar coat the white slave market & drug cartel that exists in Mexico...The truth hurts people but it's very real!!!
I absolutely loved the last 30 minutes of this movie and couldn't stop clapping at the ingenious ways these scumbags got their just due!!! The final killing is the best and will make you shout ""JUSTICE HAS BEEN DONE!!!"" All of the killings were all done different and brilliant...

Death Wish (both versions) is still my favorite but this one comes close...

822,RyaanKiing,Not the best Rambo but a good effort,6,15 October 2019,"I never thought I'd be writing a review for a new Rambo movie. I'm guessing I was with everyone else with the thought that Sylvester Stallone had hung this role up for good, he's getting older and this role can be quite demanding. But here we are... the 5th film in the Rambo series, Rambo: Last Blood.Brutal, absolute brutality. Rambo: Last Blood has it all and then some. I don't class myself as a squeamish person but even I had to look away at some parts. There are bones broken/removed, heads taken off and many limbs flying about. The team did a brilliant job of fully utilizing the adult rating. It fits well with the Rambo character, an unstoppable machine that can kill anyone with a full array of different weapons. The darker side of you will enjoy watching Rambo tear through people, it'll make for great viewing with a few drinks and mates.Felt the plot was relatively believable. Interesting enough to keep you following throughout, no long snooze off moments anyway. I split the plot to Rambo: Last Blood into two parts. The first part felt like a typical abduction film, think along the lines of Taken. You have a character get taken and then another character goes chasing after them, small scale fights happen but nothing action-packed. The second part, however, felt like a brutal adult version of Home Alone. You've got a number of enemies trying to get into a location to get a character but having difficulties due to various traps that have been planted around the area. It would be interesting to see if they took inspiration from Home Alone in any way. The second part was more enjoyable but the structure of the first part was better.The ending was good. Everything you would expect from a Rambo film. The downside is, it's super rushed. I honestly believe they had a set runtime of 90 minutes, everything was going well then they looked at the time and went, we have 15 minutes left to end everything. The first part of Rambo: Last Blood was laid out quite nice, no rushed scenes, plenty of build-ups. The last part was enjoyable but was over far too soon. It came across like I was watching the ending on 1.5x speed. Before you can even get a full grip on the situation, the credits are rolling. A contrast to the rest of the film where everything was spaced out well. So yeah, the ending was fun but short.The last point, I need to mention the acting in Rambo: Last Blood. Sylvester Stallone may not be the greatest actor but he has had some great performances, looking at you Rocky/Creed. He didn't do great in this, damn I don't even think he expressed a single believable emotion throughout. I started grinning at one point because, for 5 minutes, I didn't see anything move on Stallone's face except the top of his lip in a highly emotional scene. The rest of the cast did an average job but there were no standout performances, B-movie jobs at best.To conclude, a mostly enjoyable Rambo film, brutal as always but suffers from rushed endings and subpar acting. Order a pizza, grab some beers and you'll have a good time.6/10P.S - A great showcase of the older Rambo films is played while the credits roll so stick around.",Rambo - Last Blood

2. The only reason to make this film was to give the protagonist if not a happy ending a satisfying one. This movie fails on both counts.

830,bobcobb-84371,Bloody and violent old school action flick,8,18 September 2019,"OK, so I have to admit: I can't help but love Sly Stallone. The guy just keeps coming back succesfully, against all odds. Who would have thought that he could pull off another Rambo flick at age 73? Well, I'm glad he did, because besides Liam Neeson, Denzel Washington and Mel Gibson, who are we gonna turn to for some old school, old-man-on-a-revenge-spree flick?I was a big fan of First Blood, but didn't care so much for the second (too cartoonish) and third (too friggin' awful) installments. The fourth however, was just amazing. A slow build up, a suspenseful breakout and then cathartic violence. That last action sequence, where Rambo goes totally berserk and makes minced meat out of a whole army, I mean, come on, that was awesome.The fifth Rambo is a little different in that it is more of a generic revenge flick in its setup. But only in its setup though. As soon as Rambo starts maiming and killing, this movie goes so far over the top you can't help but cheer him on. This is one bloody movie. Last blood it may be, but it is many a full bucket of it.I also like how Rambo is more vulnarable in this flick. Stallone gets to use more of his acting chops in this one.I know it's a lot to ask, and maybe I shouldn't even hope for it, but damn it, I sure would like another one of these.",Rambo - Last Blood

834,PizzaBizza,"Brutal, evil, honest",9,23 September 2019,"This is a movie that knows no good or righteous. Rambo is not the knight in shining armor who stops the villains and saves the princess. When the hero finally springs into action, all the bad things already happened and there is nothing he can do to undo this. All he can do is take revenge and that's what he does.Rambo has changed so much during the series. In Rambos younger days, he still had some kind of honor or fought for something he thought right. Nothing of this is left here anymore. John Rambo is a paranoid, brutal man, seemingly just waiting to be ""allowed"" to kill, torture and dismember people.
This being said, the movie starts rather slow, building up tension. But when the levy finally breaks and the animal, that hides under the skin of John Rambo, is unleashed, there is no more comfort for anyone - not the bad guys, not Rambo, not the audience. The first kill in the movie was so brutal that the audience suddenly got very quiet.I celebrate this movie (and the last one), because they do not play games with the audience. Since the 80s ""Rambo"" is the epitome of violent action movies. If you watch Part III nowadays, it looks kind of cheesy and unwillingly funny sometimes. Rambo IV and V are the answer to this. They draw the audience into this maelstrom of violence and bloodshed, they do not depict war or cruelty as something to laugh about or amusing. You want to watch a violent movie - this one is straight in your face!! That's what made Part IV so astonishingly good, that's what enables Stallone to keep his character interesting. Rambo is different, because he has seen it all. ""I know how dark a mans heart can be"" he says, but he is not talking about the villains.Since the 80s Stallone and Schwarzenegger were THE two big action heroes, always competing for the crown. I always felt that Schwarzenegger was ahead of Stallone, because he had not a single really bad movie. Schwarzenegger even managed comedy (Twins for example) and even his not-so-good movies, like Kindergarden Cop are still enjoyable and very well watchable, whereas Stallone had some real bummers. But in comparison to Arnold, Stallone managed to bring all his characters, namely Rocky and Rambo to a satisfying end. Watching Rambo - First Blood now is so much more enjoyable, because you know how this character ends up some four films later. Same goes for Rocky.Schwarzenegger never finished his characters. True, Schwarzenegger also did not ""invent"" his iconic characters roles like Conan or the Terminator, but none of these stories really end. The Terminator comes back in several reboots alright, but we don't have the feeling that it's THE Terminator, it's just Arnold, playing this character again, but adding nothing new or interesting to it.I salute Stallone for his late works. He is one of the few director/actors who still manage to pull a string - and gruesomely so.",Rambo - Last Blood

859,siwoodhall,Genuinely nasty and pointless finale.,3,28 July 2020,"Like its 80s stablemate, The Terminator, this is another series that banks on the unfailing loyalty of nostalgic fans to want familiar elements but increasingly ignore plot holes, incoherent motivations and questionable casting. Sadly this is equally another case of diminishing returns, a film which reflects the nastiness and nihilism of the 2008 outing but with even less coherence or sense. Is it telling that the end credits are the most enjoyable part?!",Rambo - Last Blood
860,parbjorkman,"Tired, predictable and boring",3,21 May 2020,"This was supposed to be the great ending of the Rambo franschise, but sadly it did not go out with a bang but a sad belly dive into the nothingness.The idea of the movie is just as non imaginative as any other low budget action movie with the exact same theme: Avenge the bad druglords that killed daughter/relative.
The only exception is that this was done with much bigger budget ... but still did not manage to deliver any kind of credibility.
Maybe some people will like this movie, but in my opinion .. it should have ended with the fourth movie. It was much more thought through and in the fictive world of John Rambo, a much likely ending.I would strongly suggest that you do not watch this movie .. just as you should not watch past half of the Rocky 4 movie - that is halfway through the fight with Dolph and Sly being truthfully outboxed.Sorry to sy this, but this might just have been the worst performance by a tired and uninspired Sly that we will ever see. Hopefully it will also be the last movie he get to star in.",Rambo - Last Blood

866,jordandelage30,End Of An ERA. Full Of INSULTS To OLD Generation. Good For New Generation.,6,20 September 2019,I want to be 100% with you guys . do not believe or listen to the fans or the good reviews for this movie because it's lies .this is my third time coming back to my review and editing a few things. it truly is the end of Rambo in my mind this movie is not a terrible movie but it's not a good movie either .it is an insult to the old generation. the original Rambo films were the best. there's nothing in this film that's remarkable. there's nothing in this film that beats the originals .there's nothing in this film that is a breakout moment for me.. it's kind of insulting how this stupid director does not understand what a good Rambo movie is .to me this is not even a Rambo movie. just the title is called Rambo ..this movie is not a 10 star movie and it's not even a 8 star movie. if you're a fan of the old original Rambo movies you will not like this... This is not a truly action-packed movie. If you love action movies this movie is definitely not the best Rambo film of all time. Yes it is a good movie it's not the worst movie in the world but I think It had a lot of false advertisements from the trailers. This movie is supposed to be rated R... to me it's only a PG-13 movie.. there's not a lot of swear words not a lot of violence not a lot of explosions not a lot of blood not a lot of Gore . it's basically meant for the new generation of kids who never seen the original Rambo films... yes it's still a good movie has a few action scenes a few swear words but if you go back to the 2008 Rambo that was the most bloodiest goriest Rambo of all time.. but here's the full list of the Rambo movies in order that I would put in1. Rambo first blood. 2 Rambo part 2. 3. Rambo 4 ... 5 Rambo last blood and Rambo 3.I am kind of disappointed with Rambo last blood because they did not meet my expectations... Rambo is meant for action-packed blown out of your seat entertainment. this fall's very short. No good actors in this movie accept Sylvester Stallone .no flashbacks of the colonel trautmam... there was no flashbacks of the previous films. There was nothing in this movie that was exciting except a couple of good parts... at least Sylvester Stallone should have directed this movie like some of his past movies but no he turned it down because he knew that he did not want to make any more Rambo movies because he is getting too old but I do think they should make another movie.. the only good part I would suggest was the best in the whole movie was when they showed flashbacks of Rambo when he first joined the army and how PTSD sets in and how it can change your Brain and how emotionally disturbing your mind is.There's no good one-liners... Movie is all about revenge and taking the lives of the killers and eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth... would i watch this movie again.. yes I probably watch it one or two more times but I'd rather go back and watch The originals first... this movie was very predictable from the start .I could name 10 times where I knew the movie was headedI was definitely not on the edge of my seat .I was actually kind of bored and kind of falling asleep at some parts of the movie... This movie had some sad parts to it which were very touching to my heart but it could have been way way better..... I wish I could add more to this movie Review but there's not much more I can say to you guys but would I recommend watching it yes.. watch it one or two times and that's about it.would I like to see a part 2 to this movie definitely .it does leave off to a good start for a new generation. a new Rambo film..I think if they are going to make a part 2 too this movie you better have a better director that understands the concept of RATED R and what that means and give us fans a real explosive adrenaline nonstop blood movie almost like The Expendables or a movie like Rambo 2008.........End this review off this is how I'm going to end it do not believe the critics .do not believe the good reviews. do not believe the fans who say this is the best Rambo movie of all time. it's BS and Lies and I'm coming from a guy that watches commando' Terminator' aliens' The Expendables' true Lies' even tombstone with Kurt Russell had a lot better action than this' even Halloween 1978' 40 years ago had better action than this .even Chucky had better violence than this.... Even The three stooges had better actors and better action than this 60 years ago....Once again this Rambo movie is for the new generation the New kids on the block that do not understand what a real action movie is..... You can watch this movie or not .it's up to you . It's a good decent movie movie yes.. but can't touch the originals and will go down in history as probably the worst Rambo movie of its time. Kind of insulting in my book.....,Rambo - Last Blood

Rambo pays a high price for his vengeful rage in trying to save his nice who gets kidnapped and corrupted south of the border. The story here is so simple- the reluctant hero is forced out of the peaceful life to do what he considers the right thing. Stallone knows this character through and through, and he takes his character to a sadly inevitable conclusion- or does he? Great directing, camera work, and acting. The use of ""5 to 1"" by The Doors is wholly fitting for the carnage in the tunnels. But the brutality in this films surpasses any of the violence in the previous Rambo films.

We have seen him kill. It's what he does. This time it's personal. You feel that. I almost cried, it's Rambo. It's brutal, it's v harsh, it's Rambo in the most purist form.

I was suckered in by it.This movie didn't know what it wanted to be. Acting was terrible...even by Stallone standards. Storyline was thin. The movie tried to be serious, but it was impossible not to laugh.The saving grace is it isn't long. The action at the end is fun, although I'm not sure that's what they were going for.More than anything we left confused about how to feel. You want to be mad at wasting your money, yet the laughs were too good.I'd advise against spending money on this simply because Hollywood should not be rewarded for this piece of crap.

In this latest installment John finds himself home finally with a makeshift family for the last 9 years. When his ""daughter"" goes off to find her biological father in Mexico something goes horribly wrong. John has to unleash all of the evil inside that hes been trying keep suppressed over his history of conflict to save his daughter. John fought an Entire police force and national guard by himself, Vietnamese soldiers , an entire Russian battle group with a Spetznaz detachment, and a rogue battalion of Malaysian soldiers. This time hes fighting  Mexican drug runners and slave runners. The climax of the film is a rapid fire super violent battle of John wiping  off the face of the earth. Spoiler: he uses techniques in the past films in a total master piece of war. The critics of this film that don't like it either haven't seen any of the previous films or they have a political agenda because this is the character of John Rambo a good guy killing bad guys.

885,gp-05065,Its R A M B O !!,8,21 September 2019,"Sure, in some ways I get the critics... The script is not new, we've seen it before, we've seen the bad guys before (Mexicans), which some critics found offensive...? I'm pretty sure any other race chosen as the bad guys would offend someone these days.
Truth is, this happens in Mexico, south America or any other country.The movie begins with Rambo on a rescue mission of sorts. He's still suffering from past experiences, but manages a calm life on his ranch.
Well, short story shorter (I would've liked the movie longer), his sort of adopted ""daughter"" goes missing, sending Rambo on a rampage, bringing the final fight to his ranch.
Yes, Rambo doesnt really want to fight, he has always been drawn into it, in the previous movies. But he also always do the right thing, in his mind. So yeah the violence is bloody and gory like the one before. But war, violence IS bloody and gory... I'd rather see blood than nothing at all, like a PG13 rating. And I get the violence. Rambo is heartbroken, hurt and wants blood with capital letters. As I said, the movie could've been an half hour longer because I felt everyhing unfolded too quickly.

The outline is similar and the action over the top and the villains are cartoons.It's not deep, it's fun. Anyone who loves action movies of the 1980s ilk will realize this film is as much a paean to those movies as it is the final Rambo.The only negative is the digital effects sometimes looked rushed and cheap, but overall there's buckets of gorey action and a fitting conclusion to a simple story.Love this for what it is and don't project your hangups on it.",Rambo - Last Blood

It was fast paced like a TV movie. A rush which didn't give time to absorb the situation properly.There are some situations that I don't understand as i.e. how ""stupid"" Rambo is to confront immediately the human trafficking cartel and get nearly killed!The script is flat: Déjà vu! Old story!! It is like a remake of several similar scripts about human trafficking.I liked very much the Mexican actors though! Genuine, hard talking, excellent REAL performance.I disliked the gore! Over the top, brutal and bloody. Disappointed by Rambo's grumpy dark and sometimes too low voice - rather like an incomprehensible mumbling.Really cheap mistake to see him wounded twice and running like an athlete and using brute force to rip the gang leaders in two!So gory I had to laugh!No, in my humble opinion this movie should have been slower paced and less gory. It is a message of glorification of shear brutal revenge at all cost! I am very surprised by the high ratings which are surely mostly from American viewers.
It seams to me that Mr. Stallone wanted at all cost to make a blockbuster in his older age. Respect to Mr. Stallone but disappointed by the movie indeed I am.",Rambo - Last Blood

898,unoriginalquote,A menacing Rambo unleashed,7,6 October 2019,"Now I'll admit im a stallone fan since childhood. You can blame my older brother for that as he was a child of the 80's and there was Rocky and Rambo posters and videos everywhere. I really enjoyed this movie and enjoyed the more urban setting and seeing Rambo talk more than before etc. At its heart its a revenge movie. Rambo is more menacing in it than any of the other movies and it actually makes you believe Stallone could still kick ass even though he's 40 years older than me. However the film is extremly bleak and gets to the point a bit too quick and you can tell a few scenes are just thrown together or just edited parts of it out. It could of been 15 mins longer to flesh it out a bit. I now realise I seen the edited version with the removal of the flood scene. All the kills are close quater nasty kills with knives, hammers etc and the cam never shys away from showing what those weapons can do. I loved seeing him kicking ass. There was alot of owws and ahhs from the audience as Rambo really dishes out punishment/payback.
However its only after i seen it and a few days later i was still thinking about the movie that it gives Rambo such a raw deal. I think he's worse off at the end of this one than any of the others. That would be fine but he's 73 so unlikely to make another one and i think it should of given him a better ending to the character. So i really enjoyed it but christ its a bleak movie. I can still feel the hammer to the crotch move.",Rambo - Last Blood

If this film doesn't move your heart, the fault is in your heart - it might be black.The first hour leaves a taste to your mouth, one that makes you wish you had taken a bottle of Listerine with you instead of Coke.

901,fchestnut,Oh what have you done...,4,1 April 2020,"I can only agree with the author David Morrel, it was a very basic scenario and only a few flashbacks here and there and some killing techniques referenced the original Legend that was Rambo. The rest is a rehash of various stories already told.The last one was already bloody enough, this one takes it even further. Paz Vega is in there... no clue why, she has 10 minutes screen time and is barely relevant. It's entertaining, you don't need a lot of brain cells but man... what a missed opportunity.Last movie, we were left with Rambo going to what would be the family ranch and that's where we start further in time.Somehow, there's a mexican grandma and her granddaughter, we don't know anything about them except that the mother is dead and the father is a moron who left a long time ago. How come they are there with Rambo, go figure. It's like we're missing the short film between the last movie and this one.But the girl is only there enough to give Rambo a reason to go nuts. And nuts he goes. It's a 60 minutes setup for the 20 minutes extravaganza of the 50 ways to kill bad guys in tunnels.Rambo 2008 wasn't very profound but compared to this one, it was deep.",Rambo - Last Blood

903,carl_Deconinck,Not worth to watch,3,26 September 2019,"I am a lifelong fan of the franchise. After seeing the 'woke' reviews I wanted to watch the movie even more. Rambo 4 was a great and fun watch so my expectations were sky high. Stallone is a capable man who knows his strengths and flaws, we saw that in Rambo 4 but as well in the Creed series. The director also made some very decent action movies who knew exactly what they were. Everything was set up for Rambo to go out with a bang.Unfortunately this was not the case. This movie is a train wreck and the worst I've seen in a long long time. I want to start with the biggest problem, but there are just to many. I'll just write what comes in mind.
The movie does not know what it is, so it never finds a good pace or development. It contains several styles that don't mesh. The introduction takes way, way to long, some events make no scene, the dialogues are stupid, the action is underwhelming, the ending is has no satisfaction, there is no big fight scene or machine gun action that's worth a movie ticket, ...
There are some grains of potential in the movie (the gore, the location of the final act, the opponents) but they lead to nowhere, but many characters, scenes and dialogues lead to nowhere.
I truly felt sad after watching this movie. Avoid at all costs.People who want to watch it, ""to know what it is"", remember the final season of game of thrones. It just ruins your mind. Don't do it.",Rambo - Last Blood

I watched the other ones as well. with little expectation, but hoping they'd return to the original character which had nuances, and create a story around it, worth my time. But this, was something else.
Simplistic, dumb dialogue; idiotic decisions on part of John Rambo, and so much gore it was more reminiscent of a splatter movie.
In all honesty, it almost made Tarantino's films look quaint by comparison.
The storyline was rushed through. You feel absolutely no connection to anyone of the characters, and there's no real buildup to speak of.
Meh. I think I'll stick with the first two films instead.
This was the Rambo version of Jaws 4.",Rambo - Last Blood
907,james-taavon,Not the way you want to end a franchise...,4,22 June 2020,There are several different ways that you could have ended this franchise. The storyline that was presented here was not the way to do it. perhaps some house circle back around to the first movie with a connection to his past. I'm thinking maybe a new core of army rangers like him with a corrupt seed in the lead and he has to go and remove the corruption or something like that? I don't know something better then the movie presented would have been better anything would have been better.,Rambo - Last Blood

909,raipollard,"Not horrible, but not great",6,24 September 2019,"First off, Stallone is an absolute legend!! The amount of physical work he put into this movie would be impressive for a 40 year old, but a 73 YEAR OLD??!! Unreal!! That being said, this was a decent enough movie, but definitely NOT one of the best Rambo's out there. For one, this did not feel like a Rambo movie very much. This could have easily been written with any other ""older"" protagonist in mind. Second, the script was a little cheesy and cliche. Third (and most importantly), the majority of the movie's action takes place during the final act, which comes and goes very quickly - the entire movie is less than 90 min. If you want some quick action, blood and gore w/ minimal character/story development, this is your movie. Again, Stallone does a great job and will definitely go down as one of the greatest action/adventure stars of all time!",Rambo - Last Blood
910,jstock426,End of the Innocence,8,20 May 2021,"Unexpectedly riveting and very well acted, this film swings the pendulum from family bliss to phantasmagoric brutality when emotionally tortured John Rambo, robbed of all innocence by the horrors of the Vietnam War, experiences even greater horror when his beloved ward, Gabriela (portrayed convincingly by the beautiful Yvette Monreal), falls victim to Mexican sex merchants and succumbs to the trauma of drug overdose and physical abuse. The audience witnesses true pathos in the scene of a dying, innocent beauty shedding a tear of farewell as her life slips away while lying next to her tragic hero on their way back to the relative safety of Arizona. The graphic depiction of Rambo's subsequent revenge upon the guilty parties goes above and beyond what this reviewer ever wished to see...and now can't un-see. ""Rambo: Last Blood"" so well depicts a man yearning for innocence lost that the audience, too, surrenders a degree of innocence in seeing it.

The gore is rammed up to 11. Gone is the awful looking cgi blood from the expendables in favor of real guts, crunches and squelshes. Not for the sqemish, Rambo is fun but doesn't feel like a Rambo film. The way Creed still feels like a Rocky film. He seems out of character. Not a man really haunted by his past. The way Hugh Hackman managed so well in Logan. Whose comparison is unavoidable. That said I enjoyed watching it. I always love Stallone. Great presence on screen. You believe he can beat up 100 guys.

Like some people I don't understand some of Rambo's actions like when he went to find his niece just to got beaten up and ended up carrying her back home as a dead body. It tries to be realistic to life but c'mon this is a movie, no twist?! No explanation?! Or like when he got released by one of the gangster guy for no reason (at all?!) just as a warning?! It seems to me that most of the characters built in this movie was just a background to show Rambo's emotion side and gives a reason for his vengeance at the end of the movie, other than that they serve no purpose in this movie, their characters were built in a rush as well and did not left any strong impression.

932,josepho-20322,"John Rambo: Tortured Survivor, Tireless Warrior",7,20 September 2019,"It's taken almost 40 years but we finally have a sequel that is worthy of the survivalist cat-and-mouse drama that was 1982's ""First Blood"". We also have, for the very first time, a terrifying vision of a mentally disturbed and physically intimidating ex-Green Beret so accurate to the book that he may well have walked off the pages of David Morrell's ""First Blood"".To say that this performance as Rambo is unlike anything Stallone has done before is an understatement. He has truly tapped into a dark place for this film, expressing a bottomless seething rage in Rambo that burns bright despite his age.The relationship between Rambo and his niece is one of the most affecting and deliberately underplayed of the entire series, my only criticism being that we should have had more of it. The niece (Yvette Monreal) could have done with more screen time, indeed the ""racism"" card that a lot of critics are playing is based on that very issue. Both she and Rambo's house keeper seem at times little more than plot devices and triggers for the eventual rampage. Some have said that they are one dimensional characters, and that they play into racial stereotypes, but I disagree.""Last Blood"" is a very simple, direct narrative. It is quite frankly anti-high brow, it's characters have purpose and power and there is a lot left unsaid when it comes to context and back story. Even it's main character is drawn in this way. However I do not consider this a weakness.",Rambo - Last Blood
933,andrewcollins-96996,A serious review of rambo,6,26 November 2019,"So. This movie definitely delivered on what I wanted. It was awesome, it was burtal and there was a surprisingly heartfelt moment which I didn't expect. But. Is this a good movie. No not at it's core. It's a bad movie with some really good elements and I'll get to that in a minute.The good. This movie delivers on what we expected, the brutal finally which was very satisfying. Sly does a good job acting as always even in that emotional scene. Basically everyone else does a good job acting as well.
As I said this is not a GOOD movie, just a bad movie with some amazing elements.The bad
I kind of hinted at it above with the brutal finally. Because the end is basically all the action you get. Now there is a small torture scene and a small epic hammer fight but that's really it. And For me this isn't always a bad thing unless it's done right. Like the Jackie Chan movie titled The Forigner. First of all, like the Forigner a problem with both movies is hos the movie was marketed. An action film. Second of all there is A LOT of runtime padding to it's already incredibly short runtime of about 80 minutes. And if that padding was taken out than the movie would be 30-45 minutes tops. The filler is basically a romance between rambo and a reporter that doesn't really go anywhere.A few bad side notes1. There were a few shots in the movie that were LAUGHABLY out of foucas.2. Mexico is depicted basically as fox news Mexico. A land where everyone is a gang member.Now that brings me to the end. I know I shat on the movie alot but that doesn't mean I completley hate it. It's a bad movie but I absolutely love the last 20 minutes and that's what saves the movie from a 3 or 4 star up to a 6 star.Now if you wanna watch the movie I can easily confirm that you could fast forward through most of it without missing any important plot points. But I do not believe you should skip this either.",Rambo - Last Blood

935,william-03717,Very disappointing,3,1 January 2020,"This movie will be very familiar if you have seen Taken and Crocodile Dundee II. Seriously, there is no original content here, as there was with the first Rambo films. Even if you just watch without taking that into account, the premise is still a bit unbelievable.Rambo knows the niece's friend sold her out, yet when he takes her to the club, she says ""there's the guy she was talking to"" and then Rambo allows her to leave. She could have been lying just to save her own tail. After all his talk about not being able to trust her, he then trusts her. It felt kind of weak to me.The gang lets Rambo live so that he can ""think about"" everything the girl must be going through. Really? The guy knows where you are and what you do, and you let him live? After Rambo recovers, he goes and finds his niece at the first place he looks, which was completely different than the original house where he got beat up. How did he know this place and that she would be there?And what was his plan? He had a single gun and a knife. He thought he would just walk in to their house and they would let her go? No one would ever do this without a plan or without any kind of reconnaissance. And then he would have seen the dozens of armed men guarding the house.You might be saying, ""well that journalist lady helped him find it"". Well they didn't show that, and in fact the journalist lady should have had more of a part to this story than the brief moments we saw her. I could have seen this as a movie whereby she recruits her friends, aka Crocodile Dundee, and they all help Rambo accomplish his goal while taking down the whole gang. But alas, this was not to be.After Rambo grabs his niece, she is about to die and Rambo takes her for a drive to get back home. The journalist lady had skills as a nurse, why didn't he take his niece to her? Or a hospital? She was clearly in bad shape. His revenge could have taken place while she was still recovering. I realize this was his niece, but there was absolutely no chemistry between the two and it's hard to tell if they were even close at all. There should have been more development here.And the gang's army, oh my, they just immediately take a caravan to the US via their own tunnels in order to get revenge. No preparation, just impulse. We all have seen enough gang movies to know this doesn't happen this way. In reality, they would have been able to find out that Rambo was a war hero and they would have done surveillance before doing anything. Someone that causes that much chaos and violence is clearly out for something and has skills.How did Rambo obtain all those explosives and firepower? If we are to believe the movie tropes, Rambo was a loner. As a ""family man"" he would have had no need to have all this unless he was just flat paranoid.All in all, this was a movie that couldn't wait to get to the violence at the end, and in fact they could have just shown some clips for the first hour and then ran the final half hour and you would have come out with the same feeling over a 40 minute movie. Yes, the movie was short at 89 minutes, but there was a lot of empty filler material whereby they could have expanded on some of those earlier scenes, created a connection between Rambo and his niece, and showed a lot more planning and ""back and forth"" by both sides. When compared to other movies right now that run 2+ hours, the producers hurt this movie by cutting it down. Coulda been an 8+ movie, shoulda been an 8+ movie considering the franchise, but it doesn't come close. If you want action, just watch the final half hour. If you want a story, watch something else.",Rambo - Last Blood

939,VinsendVega,Taken meets Home Alone in this disappointing end to the Rambo Saga.,5,27 November 2019,"Although this type of kidnapping story has been done many times before, Last Blood starts out pretty good.John has retired and spends his time taking care of his adopted family, rescuing some people and prepping for the next world war. When his daughter gets taken in Mexico and forced into prostitution Rambo has to go save her.This movie succeeds in showing the ruthlessness of these cartels and the horrible situation these girls live in. I really liked the bond with his family and the idea of him having to take this Cartel on in an Urban environment.Unfortunately that did not happen... Instead he just stupidly walks up to te cartel leaders house, gets cornered by 50 or so armed guys and only survives because the guy in charge is an idiot.After recovering for a few days he just walks into some brothel with a hammer murders a few people and rescues his daughter without any resistance.
-Can someone explain why this is suddenly super easy? When they know exactly who he is and who he is looking for!?Then after all this trouble... She dies and it becomes a revenge story.Rambo murders one of the brothers and the entire cartel follows him to his to his house where he installed some fun surprises for them. The fight starts like some good old Rambo fun, but then everyone just keeps running into every single trap like some gruesome home alone movie... The whole fight only takes 10 minutes or so and it seems like there trying to cover up the stupidity in gore and blood. Then when everybody is dead he blows everything up, what he could have done from the start, rips the guys hard out and dies...Disappointing story, bad decisions and very few good action scenes.

The plot here is the one that Stallone considered for the fourth one in 2008, before deciding to do the Burma story instead. As a result it feels like another self-contained Rambo adventure, nothing wrong with that but considering they called it Last Blood it doesn't feel like you're watching the grand sendoff of an iconic character (compared to Rocky Balboa, for example). I also think Rambo's best when he's in the jungle or woods, but that's just me.

946,Accolyptus,Novel Blood vs Movie Blood?!,7,24 September 2019,"Hey people of the movie-world,Nice to write a little review about this movie and the series in overal.
In high respect for David Morrel's and Stallone's version and interpretation of John Rambo.Did you ever wonder why there have been so many Rambo movies while john Rambo originally dies in the classic high rated novel of David Morrell's first blood?
Do we ever wonder why movies never live up to the original setting all to much?Simple fact.....after sales and after stories.
If they would have made Rambo die as he originally intends to in the end of First Blood, he would have never been able to become as iconic as we seen him in the films. Ultimately changing John Rambo novel from a war veteran who's pushed over the edge by another war veteran who fought inside the Korean war.if you could ever compare Rambo with what happened to these war veterans during the Vietnam war, as in aftercare was pretty bad for these veterans, then you should understand why John Rambo totally snaps and takes his anger and rage out on a arrogant sheriff who doesn't show respect nor understanding to WHAT Rambo really is.
A Fully fledged Green Barrett Anti personal Killing Machine, as Colonel Trautmann says in the movies.This is where critics between novel truths and realism based character progression and movie fact are mixed up in most of the critics you will read about.When you start to see these films and keep comparing them to the novel, then in such case all movies start to gradually make no sense and Rambo's character becomes an invisible bullet sponge who just doesn't seem to die. Totally ridiculous to no end. If you watch Rambo with the intend to see satisfying vengeance and rage kills, then Rambo is totally badass to go with.First blood and Rambo (IV) and Last Blood follow a certain line in where you can see how the movie tries to get in touch with Rambo's original creation.
Which is all about this quote : ""The war inside a Vietnam vet trying to make amends with his past""Last blood is a crown jewel on the saga, and it does go over the top with style but that is exactly what you should expect. Rambo movies are made to go over the top compared to the novel so keep this in mind and you shall enjoy every bit of last blood!!Cheers!",Rambo - Last Blood

I really enjoyed First Blood , everything after that could not reach it's level and rapidly declined. I can't even remember the other ones. Of course, this is common in most movies that have 2nd,3rd and so on installments.In this last chapter, John is now living on family property , training horses and has 2 persons living with him a young woman(Gabrielle) and I believe her grandmother (who was around when his father owned the property).
Now, Gabrielle has located her real father in Mexico and needs to ask him the usual questions. John says no , the grandmother reveals some disturbing facts and says no. I guess no means yes and she goes to meet a friend (who located the dad in the first place) over the border. Everything goes to crap after , but has nothing to do with the dad but the friend being responsible and the cartel for her kidnapping. That is the setup.This was the first time a Rambo movie can be classified as a horror movie. There is some serious gore in the trademark Rambo final battle against a small cartel army. It has that dark feeling too , due to the nature of the subject.
I give it a 4.5 as I watched it all the way through and most likely will watch it one more time. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it Rambo? Yes.",Rambo - Last Blood

In 2019, they think you need a pink unicorn in a war movie.Not to forget that the film has even some emotional scenes.Maybe it could be more long than 1h 40m, I've the sensation that some scenes or trips where too skip/short.",Rambo - Last Blood
954,richardromano1,Excellent and brutal,9,2 November 2019,"Stallone looks every bit as fearsome as he always was as John Rambo; he's 73, but remains well-muscled and he throws that muscle around in believable ways. Cartels are widely despised, evil organizations, so it's great cathartic fun watching Rambo dispatch them with brutal precision and intensity. The last scene is an obvious reference to Aztec culture, the Mexica, from which the cartels are derived, taking their ritual barbarisms to new heights the last several years in modern Mexico.The acting is serviceable and the cartel leadership is ably vile and sleazy. They get all they deserve and then some. If you like Rambo movies, you'll LOVE this one. 9/10",Rambo - Last Blood

They are coming for your children America, so thank god that the grizzled Veteran walnut John Rambo exists as the thin red line between you and them.Saying that, it must clock up the highest number of decapitations per film on record and a nice Temple of doom esque ending - so not all bad.Just ignore the fact that he armed and trained the Taliban two films back.",Rambo - Last Blood

972,shanekeller,They Should Have Put Rambo To Rest after Rambo 3,5,7 June 2020,"The first three Rambo films are what defined the Rambo Legend... An unforgettable character tormented by death, bad luck, trauma, the ignorance of others, and the past. The pain of the human condition drew you in.Rambo (2008) was just 'ok' and did not harm the franchise but it could have ended there.Rambo: Last Blood feels as though they could have just left the legend alone and never created this one.I do like the modernization of the new ""enemy"" as the Cartels and the scenes in Mexico had a believable dangerous atmosphere but it could have gone into greater depth. The cartel needed more character development, more back story, and some connection to real life cartels to add to the suspension of disbelief.And, of course, the actual revenge action sequences seemed too short. We all looked at each other and asked: ""Was that it?""I believe if the action was taken to the cartel, with Rambo devastating the enemy on their home turf, it would have been more satisfying. You want Rambo to dismantle the system because in all his films - he is dismantling a system. It is the kind closure the audience is hungry for when it comes to Rambo. The audience experiences their rage through Rambo. Enough said.",Rambo - Last Blood
973,trulyjewelly,The Best Thing Ever,10,20 September 2019,"Finally, I really get it. It is pure inspiration, salvation and resolution - it truly has a magical psychological property (the whole series of films) to do with trusting that humans can do the right thing. There will be a saviour. It's fantastic and I don't want to analyse it because I might lose some of it's positioning in my brain, as I've only just watched it. What Therapy! Absolutely amazing and the critics who measure it in a literal way according to it's violence, don't get it. I keep my eyes shut during a lot of the violence but I see enough to keep abreast of what's happening (a breast with a beating heart ripped out, ha ha). Just remind yourself that it's actors and not real, then withstanding the most shocking stuff, the story works in an abstract way. It's brought home by violence and that's the point of the violence. It's political, realistic, relevant and such a good story and good art. Sympathetic to all the reasons that somebody as fantastic and truly good hearted as Rambo, would judiciously go and dispatch a whole criminal cartel of sickos - singlehanded. It's a particular recipe that's identifiable in all the plots which includes the fact that he's SAS trained, so expert in weapons and it makes you think about what the difference really is between a maverick going after the revolting non-human types that he does, and a state sanctioned army doing it. When you're free of legal restrictions you do an infinitely better job. What a joke that people compare it to Home Alone although in a vague way the plot is the same - it's more like Doctor Who as there's a supernatural hero wiping out tons of baddies, even a whole race or planet singlehandedly. I'm referring to the Dr Who series of the '70s and '80s, mind you. It's not really like anything though.",Rambo - Last Blood

You couldn't rehash another war scenario, and to see John Rambo having a human side was great, obviously before the 'Rambo' side kicked it.I enjoyed it. Simple, because that's what is is.

983,vikingsjas12,A great movie and a great ending to the Rambo series...,10,23 September 2019,"The so called critics that label this movie as a ""Trumpian fantasy"" really have something to learn. They need to learn that there is evil in the world and sex trafficking is really happening. Not only in Mexico, but in other parts of the world as well. These so called critics say this movie is a fantasy, but do they have the statistics of how many poor girls and women have been force into the sex trafficking business? I guess to them it's not happening, especially in Mexico. What a joke. If you are one of the so called critics you are a critic for a reason - REVIEW THE MOVIE for the MOVIE not your Truth or political beliefs! I actually read the critics reviews for the last year and then have read the audience reviews and I have to say, I agree MUCH more with the audience who is really reviewing the movie without some kind of agenda in mind - at least most of the audience does.Anyhow, the movie starts a little slow, but builds up very nicely and talk about a great ending. If you thought Rambo was brutal in his previous movies you are in for a treat! I love how he lures these sex traffickers back to his farm, just great. I understand that Rambo is fictional character, but these movies have dealt with real issues that have happened or are happening in the world.I would highly recommend this movie, if you are a fan of the series. I like 1, 2 4 and 5 - 3 not so much. Stay for the credits as it is a great montage of all the previous Movies.

Terrible acting

Terrible story
Great action
Great violenceWARNING WARNING SPOILERS ahead
.... ............................... ...............................This movie allowed me to get my pop-corn refill and tell my friends to not worry to tell me what I missed (let me guess the girl´s friend (bad Jezel/Gizzelle) sold her to pimps and Rambo drove all the way to Mexico to rescue her? as I returned just when the gang drew all their weapons and left when her father made the dumb I hate you scene) That said, Maria told Gabrielle that her father was beating her mother as cancer patient with a belt when Rambo stopped him and became her father since but Gabrielle father says that when his wife died left him with her and hate it.Anyway, as the title says, this is just a very bad MAN ON FIRE remake were a renegade gringo drive all the way to Mexico and kill everyone, but with a twist, all the bad guys go back to USA for the Home Alone gag, but i prefer to remember Conan the Barbarian´s Battle of the Mounds than Home Alone.And not let get started about the border crossing with the dead/agonizing girl (hmmm, make me wonder, what if Rambo take Gabrielle to a Mexican hospital to save her instead to drive all the way from Mexico to USA? so Rambo may caused her death?, makes you think right?.Also, Mexico / USA are couple hours from Rambo farm to, what? Tijuana?Long story short, there will be Last Blood 2 as Rambo refused to die at the end.The 3 stars are for all the Gore....Cheers...´.S.: Terrible remake of MAN ON FIRE",Rambo - Last Blood
986,fedge1968,THE WORST of all the Rambo movies!,1,20 September 2019,"This will be blunt.I just saw Rambo: Last Blood.It is THE WORST of all the Rambo movies. It is so bad, just by existing, it actually elevates movies 2 & 3 to a higher rating.As xbs2034 noted earlier, the movie is missing a middle act. It's also missing any semblance of a logical script. We are parachuted into a sort-of family dynamic on Rambo's farm that is barely explained, if at all. We are led to believe Rambo has lived a peaceful, serene and danger-free lifestyle on the farm for many years by this point. A plot point, created by a character we just met and don't care about, ends this serenity. The middle act is then skipped over, in favor of a violent third act that is so over the top, and often times, outright illogical, that it makes any of Rambo's previous adventures seem like high art by comparison.The movie ends as abruptly as it began, having proven to the world it was totally unnecessary, and a waste of, thankfully, ONLY 89 minutes of your life you will not get back.That Rambo: Last Blood currently has a 7.2 rating just goes to show how easily impressed some movie watchers can be.Avoid, not even the eventual 4K disc will save this turdlet!",Rambo - Last Blood

1012,shottyvalentine,Rambo-A Natural Hero,10,21 September 2019,"Only Sylvester Stallone's brilliance in acting and writing can bring back the true nature of the mastermind of war as perfectly as he can. This movie is a magnificent representation of the true war hero, killing evil and saving/protecting the innocent. In the words of Colenol Trautman, ""It's like sending the pigeons to the cat,"" ""God would have mercy; he won't,"" and ""Rambo was the best."" Let's not forget ""You don't want to deal with the fact you're dealing with an expert!"" And, ""If you send that many people after him you better remember one thing...a good supply of body bags!"" Rambo puts together all of his skills in the last and most significant battle of his life in the name of karmic justice. Fearlessly awaiting his prey, it is both extremely impressive but not surprising at all to see Rambo's abilities in destroying the enemy all come together in one memorizing action packed theatrical scene. Sylvester Stallone is an iconic hero and I love what he did with Last Blood. He's truly the same hero he was in the beginning, fighting for justice and remaining a moral human being while battling PTSD on a daily never-ending basis. Sylvester Stallone shows in Rambo how humanity should be as he fights for the good and destroys the bad. I really can't say enough about the actor and his Rambo movies. I've loved them all since the beginning.",Rambo - Last Blood
1013,shottyvalentine,Love love love!!!!!!!,10,7 November 2019,"Grew up as a huge Rambo fan as I love the mind over matter mentality and how he somehow balances PTSD through extreme traumatic experiences and still manages to be a good hearted moral human being. Unbelievably amazing this character of Rambo is that Stallone brought to life with the picture perfect representation of a strong willed soldier- both physically and mentally. The more I think about this movie, the more I adore it because he shows us what many parents- or loving guardians- are capable of if you hurt the babies in the family, no matter how old they are. Love for a child is forever and once again Stallone, Rambo, proves this in his own special mesmerizing way.",Rambo - Last Blood

When You go to watch a film like this You dont look for an Oscar's plot, nor the best intriguing development of actions: You look for bullets, blood and revenge, ant the film has It all in enormous amount. You can feel the rage the man suffers and would like to join him if You could at any second.
I cant stop thinking that when in some years Stallone and Schwarzzenegger are gone, then the action movies, the real ones will have gone with them leaving us with a new kind of action that will not be on the top of our likes.Believe me, if you want a Rambo film, this one is for you. If you want a more CGI then move to another kind of movie. Rambo is here and will always be.",Rambo - Last Blood
1017,info-87296,Was Stallone in the movie ?,3,15 December 2019,"Very predictable story, seen a hundred times before with low or no acting talent what so ever. But this is Stallone, so who cares about acting ?
Or isn't it Stallone ? I saw a chump of silicones walking over the screen. What happened to his face ? Well, we all know the answer, but it looks awful !
Plastic surgery sure didn't do Rambo any good.",Rambo - Last Blood

Wasn't expecting much given the film's low profile, but was pleasantly surprised. Yes it's predictable, sentimental, bloody - but the simplicity works. Not a classic by any stretch, but worthwhile viewing for action fans who aren't unduly bothered by movie ultraviolence.Neck and neck with IV for the second-best Rambo film, and perhaps shades it. By the time the credits roll, it has provided a satisfactory conclusion to the series.",Rambo - Last Blood
1019,jarlen-63639,Not Rambo,1,27 December 2019,"It has absolutly nothing to do with Rambo.I just i don't understand how they could ever release something like this, and be ok with it. I mean someone on the set must at some point have thought ""this isn't right!""
Theres has just been put absolutely no effort into this at all!Even though this was probably only made to milk the ""Cashcow"" that the Rambo franchise is, it blows my mind that people working on this didn't put just the tinniest amount of effort into making this slighty more meaningfull????Every character in this movie makes absolutely no sense and are aparently complete morons.
So in this movie Rambo has moved back to, what i think is his childhood home, with his adopted family. The daughter then wants to find her real father and they say ""NO he is bad guy, you can't go!"" obviosly she goes anyway.She then gets in trouble because she is heartbroken that her father is a jerk and goes out with no regard for her own safety.And now Rambo has to go save her.Thats pretty much it, wich could be fine if they were making just a bad action movie, but why the hell would u wanna use this plot for a Rambo movie.They could have done so many things different to finish off the Rambo story. but this was absolutely disgracefull.The people behind this have no dignity!",Rambo - Last Blood
1020,alrightalright1151,If you like revenge...,10,6 July 2020,"This is for you. I am not a traditional Rambo fanatic, but I do like the action revenge genre. Similar to Denzel in Equalizer, Stallone delivers in a big way.10/10 from me",Rambo - Last Blood
1021,Portia_3971,Am I dumb?,9,7 December 2020,"I went to the cinema twice to see this movie because I enjoyed it so much. I am therefor perplexed at the backlash because I feel like I missed something. I see a lot of comparison to 'Taken' and 'Home Alone' in a very unfavorable light. I can understand that to some extent because some plot points of the movie are similar to aforementioned movies. But 'Taken' and 'Home Alone' do not own the rights of those tropes. Instead, I feel we have to go back to 'First Blood' to understand the context of 'Last Blood'. In 'First Blood' we see Rambo who recently returned from Vietnam to seek his comrades, but instead, he discovers he is the only one left. Not to mention he has untreated PTSD and the scorn of society who calls him ""vile crap"". He is a lost soul and at the brink of losing touch with his humanity. The only person who pulls him back is Trautman. Oh, it is also a revenge movie. Now Rambo II, III and IV ignored that and instead were - mostly - silly action set-pieces to show off how macho Stallone is. But with 'Last Blood' we return to the existentialistic theme where Rambo is trying to settle and reconnecting with people around him. Our cinema played the international version with the extended intro where Rambo failed to save 2 out of 3 hikers from the storm. He went home and ruminated about it, indirectly implying he feels that all he knows is killing people and that bothers him.That goes back to Rambo feeling he could not save his comrades during the Vietnam war. It is not his fault but he bears the burden of guilt. Instead of Rambo being portrayed as the perfect killing machine like the author of the book wants him to be, we instead see a Rambo being portrayed as a human again: grief-stricken, alienated, coping with untreated PTSD and full of rage. He has not adjusted well to a civilized life, he instead spends time on his ranch and tunnels. Which by the way indirectly implies that Rambo spent time in the Cu Chi tunnels of the Vietnam War. In other words: Rambo might have been a tunnel rat, performing sabotage missions. That perfectly fits well with the character's lore of being a specialist in guerilla tactics. Oh, the humanity part? He finally connected with his humanity through his adopted niece, but then it got taken away from him. Also, people calling Gabriela dumb and being a prop to Rambo's bloodshed is missing the point. Gabriela, like Rambo, took on an - albeit dangerous - existential journey to understand her past better, like Rambo did in ""First Blood Part II"". If Gabriela is dumb, then what is Rambo then in ""First Blood Part II""? Or am I reading too much into the movie and have no understanding of how people with damaged pasts work? Anyway, I am glad the movie went back to the roots of the character and like Paul Harrell said not being another ""blood and guts routine"" like Rambo IV is. Rambo here actually had an arc and Stallone was actually acting too instead of just snarling and mumbling one-liners into the camera. I am honestly a bit torn between having 'First Blood' or 'Last Blood' as my favorite Rambo movie, but I guess I am just a fanboy.",Rambo - Last Blood
1022,lassua-1973,Fun movie,7,24 January 2021,"I have enjoyed most Rambo films and stories and this one is no different.
This time Rambo hosts the baddies instead of going to them.

1027,scentofrain,REVENGE AS A VIRTUE,10,23 September 2019,"Obviously this last installment of Rambo is a love letter to all the fans of the previous movies.
You got to think about it not like another separete Rambo movie. Think of it like it's the final denaument of a very long movie... the epilogie of a lifetime story of Rambo of Stallone as an action icon. As i can see the ""critics"" are not capable to understand this. So just ignore them.Full respect for Sylvester Stallone, for his indipendence that he never tended to be someone else, someone that he isn't. Not coloring his hair. Not covering age wrinkles. Always trying to teach us a simple lesson in the movies he scripted. In most of them the lesson is that you've got to fight for the things you want and love, also never give up and always stand up on your feet no matter how hard for you it will be. And damn he looks great and always with incomparable presence. Everytime i see him i got that safety~cosy feeling of comming home for christmas or when put your warm sweather on a very cold day.
He's aging the best way a real man should. Looking rough and tough. Got that Cliff where the waves are crashing everlasting look.In LAST BLOOD we understand that Rambo is not a hero, not an ordinary guy living a sheltered life, but a victim of his own lonelyness, nightmares and oppressed rage. And the only thing that holds this painfull emotinal dam not to crumble is his niece which is almost like daughter to him because he don't have a family. She is now the only chance Rambo can bequeath any moral values or life lessons to somebody.
And when the things go wrong we witness what happens when the pain inside is the strongest and most successfull motivator that can unleashes the HELL (in the full meaning of the word) upon the one who attempt to get in his way.The atmosphere of the movie is like slowly sharpening a knife and cut yourself several times but continue to sharpening it. Sharpening, and sharpening until you begin to want to kill something ...something alive, something with blood and heartbeat... and then suddenly to stab it, stab it, stab STAB, STAB no matter you know that the thing is already dead. And after all this you feel no releif or satisfaction just complete emptiness.If i got to rank RAMBO: LAST BLOOD like a separete movie i probably give it a 7 out of 10. But it's not just a movie it's a lifetime achievemnet, it is a result to almost 40 + years of hard work and dedication so EXCUSE me so called critics but it's the easiest and best desereved 10 stars i've ever given.",Rambo - Last Blood
1028,george-ilinca,Excellent movie,10,16 January 2020,"Not such a big fan of extreme bloody scenes. But the movie is simple and straightforward, avoids most cliches and basically raises serious issues that are very much ignored today, with great scenes and great acting. It's a direct yet heartfelt Rambo movie. Oh, and also points out how easy it is to cross the US Mexican border :)",Rambo - Last Blood
1029,bunnysidhu,Underwhelming at all levels apart from the over the years footage,3,23 September 2019,"I didn't know what to expect when I went in for this. Being my first time in a 4DX was exciting for a short while. This movie was blatantly just Taken with Stallone as a replacement for Liam Neeson. There was no originality in this movie, characters just popping in and popping out of the scenes with no real purpose. No explanation as to why a particular scene was of importance. I did not once root or be connected to the adopted daughter more than what I felt for all the other girls being abused. Character arcs had no relevent tangents and it was just one scene after the other. No explanation as to how he managed to track his adopted daughter in such short time. Mexico seems to be just a little township of about 200 odd people living there. He simply reached the exact place without ever knowing where to go. So what exactly was the lady journalist's importance, I fail to understand. Well whatever, it was a total disappointment, being supposedly the last of the Rambo movies it was a damp spot. The previous Rambo was far better and enjoyable than this half hearted effort. C'Mon who cares about Mexico, there are far better geopolitical prospects that could have been the premise of the story. Why couldn't Rambo go to N. Korea and bash up their dictator. That would have been far more interesting.",Rambo - Last Blood

Every Rambo story is essentially the same. This is a more violent version of the same story and historically each movie in the franchise has been more violent than the last one. What did you think you were going to get? At least this one has some basis in truth.
1. We all know that Mexican Cartels exist and they are essentially evil.
2. We all know that they deal in sex trafficking of young girls.
3. We all know they get these girls addicted to drugs and many die from overdose.
4. We all know that they seek brutal revenge from rivals who mess with their territory or their ""product"".All ""Last Blood"" did was insert Rambo into this equation to add the violence and gore to his revenge. No one who knows this franchise should be watching this expecting great acting, an exceptionally crafted storyline or any depth of character development.

1053,madmat-mp,Brilliant. IMDb needs to eradicate the quac,10,9 February 2020,"It's a great film. So don't think you need to ask a quack. But for some reason, this film only says 6+. Now I know the last 50 reviews say 10 or 8, so why such a low score. 2 things. The 1st are quacks, who have absolutely no connection with reality, who give it 1 or 2. Most if not all of these quacks are people with an agenda that's has nothing to do with the quality of a film. They just like to be different. They are usually people who like to be noticed, they want people to see them. Well, ok, now we have done with this, what about the 2nd reason. Well, con Tarley, or contrary, to popular belief, many commentators state that there is a conspiracy, involving voting. I don't believe this, it's not true...I believe it has more to do with the algorithm, and it's method. If they take the mean average, then all it takes is a quack, to completely undo, the honest vote of 10 people. If they use the median, then, it can be worse. So the answer to this chaotic mathematical rule is simple. It's broken. We allow some mind befuddled idiot, who has a secret personal agenda, to falsely rate a film, giving adverse advice, against 10 others, and they are allowed to get away with it. So what do we do.. you can't fix a broken system, until the administrators change the algorithm. In the mean time, or median time, just accept that 10% of voters are quacks. Exactly the same way that the legal system with a jury, needs to take this into account. That's why a hung jury requires 2 out of the 10. The 1 is acceptable for a conviction or an acquittal. We need to change the algorithm, to fully give the best rating, allowing of course, for those that like to disagree. Thank you. And please post this. It's the truth.",Rambo - Last Blood
1054,richardirvine,Last Blood...big sigh,5,22 September 2019,"""Last blood ""review.
I probably watched "" First blood"" aged about 13-14. Since then it's always been a firm favourite of mine for various reasons.(please watch if you have never seen it).Great locations, cast,simple but believable action and a character you could empathise with.Stallone was on top form.The subsequent Rambo films were still enjoyable but increasingly stepping too far from reality.
With "" Last blood "" likely to being the final chapter I guess I had an unrealistic hope that they could somehow recapture the heart of the original.It saddens me to say that all involved have done it a great injustice.Its the weakest of all the John Rambo films.
Predictable all round, clunky ,and even the normal dependable action left me feeling short changed.Stallone tries his best but he and the audience deserve a better send off. Like in all recent efforts to attempt to better the original films eg. the trilogy of Star Wars films, sometimes you need to stop , walk away, and know when to leave something perfect alone.

1056,Ispeakfrom_myheart,I wish I haven't Seen it!,1,27 September 2019,"Rambo 5 shouldn't have been made as a graphic, revenge film! This is a huge mistake. In the previous films John Rambo, a highly skilled and brave soldier, never lost his humane side. In Rambo 5 he is savage- mutilating, decapitating, injuring with intend to cause maximum damage and pain. This is so far away from the fine human being with tortured soul, which Stallone created in the classic First Blood of 1982!I loved John Rambo for his resilience, for his ability to push back when the world was tearing him apart! The ""new"", badly aged Rambo has lost that ability.Rambo was an icon and a cause! Previously he spoke on behalf of the forsaken Vietnam war veterans and he spoke well. In Rambo 5 he is degraded and reduced to a weak, riddled with mental health issues, blood-thirsty monster. This is not my John J. Rambo. My one was fearless, heroic and dignified Man. He was a Defender!In my heart Rambo died in 2008, in Burma. A bullet ended his life while he was defending the humanitarian missionaries from Colorado and the Karen triebespeople, gunning down the vicious Tint's army with M2 Browning machine gun.Rest in Peace Honorable John J. Rambo!P.S. 1 October, 2019.
I just read a review by Somebodywhatever. He calls Rambo: Last blood - ""beautifully brutal"".Well, there is no beauty in brutality. There is nothing worthy of adoration in decapitating people and pinning them with straws then cutting their hearts out. That is pure savagery. Sorry, but if this is the new norm for ""beautiful"" in US film-making, which seems to be the case, I say - stop the bus, I am off! And if this is what nowadays' American audience needs in order to feel excited - I distance myself as far as possible. I take your negative ratings of my review as COMPLIMENT!A few words to Stallone. You are a smart and talented film-maker, Mr. Stallone. What made you do this disgraceful parody of Rambo action film, I don't want to know. But I would like to remind you that as prolific writer and actor, you have some responsibility to society and especially to the young ones who are watching your gore-feast of a movie. What do you teach them? What will you teach your future grand kids?I will conclude my review with a quote by Ingmar Bergman - one of the most accomplished, acclaimed and influential filmmakers of all time:
""No form of art goes beyond ordinary consciousness as film does, straight to our emotions, deep into the twilight room of the soul.""Keep that in mind, Mr. Stallone, before you decide to do another one type Rambo 5, brutality- laden, parody of a movie!",Rambo - Last Blood

True redemption through violence and the wreaking of havoc is not available. John is no longer the heroic protector of the weak, no more the sword of righteousness & vengeance.

comically bad. The last Rambo from 2008 I found to be excellent but this one can't be taken serious. It's no comparison to the realism of the 2008 Rambo and it's non stop action.

He was supposed to be in special forces. Back in the Vietnam days, SF soldiers wore infantry brass. An officer would have two large crossed rifles on each lapel. Also, he would have a combat infantry badge above his ribbons. Except for when he would have been awarded the MOH, every official photo in uniform would have the MOH ribbon at the very top as the highest award.

The last Rambo as the boatman in Burma left this character closed out correctly, what I saw I waited patiently to see Stallone to head bad guy ""Sue me for what?"" after playfully extracting the mans heart which does nothing for the film as he is already dead.The first time I looked at my watch I discovered six minutes left.

1097,jamesleonard-62970,Rambo has been ruined,3,24 August 2020,"What the hell has happened to Rambo?! Similar to the fourth film Stallone is intent on indulging in as much unnecessary gory violence as possible so he can try to shock and supposedly thrill viewers at the same time. This is far from the Rambo I remember, the Rambo I knew and loved was a fun action hero who who fought in the name of his country and could single handedly take on swarms of armies by himself. Before the fourth film came out these movies were fun and enjoyable the action was well staged and the characters and villains were all highly memorable. Instead with these last two installments Stallone has turned Rambo into an insanely violent and sadistic individual who enjoys torturing and maiming his enemies. He's tried giving the last two films a more realistic edge by tackling much darker subject matter like mass genocide and human trafficking while also amping up the violence 10x more. These films, especially this one are trying to tap into what made first blood such a great film but they simply fail he's not a broken man anymore he's just a sadistic killing machine. Yes they turned him into a killing machine in 2 and 3 but those movies unlike the new ones were fun. Yes, they were cheesy and had unrealistic qualities but at the end of the day they were highly entertaining and they were Rambo at his most iconic. The villains were charismatic and you loved to hate them instead Rambo 4 and last blood have uncharismatic, greasy villains who happen to be rapists just so it justifies how brutally Rambo kills them. You just hate them not ""love to hate them"". No Stallone I don't need to see a teen girl get drugged, raped, and beaten by cartel traffickers and then see you plunge you're knife into a guys chest and rip out his heart with you're bare hands while also indulging in crappy gore cgi. Instead I'd rather see col trautman (who isn't even mentioned in last blood probably because he's consider to ""cheesy"" of a character for the modern Rambo film's standards) being kidnapped by a charismatic Russian general and then an 80s Rambo save him while blowing up Soviet helicopters with explosive arrows. That's what I'd rather see.",Rambo - Last Blood
1098,jamesleonard-62970,Not my Rambo,3,25 August 2020,This is not Rambo his entire look from the long mane to the bandanna has been abandoned. It's not just the look his personality has also been changed substantially and he talks way more than Rambo should among other things. The last 2 Rambo film's indulged in overly gory violence and tackled very real life topics in a somewhat innapropiate fashion. 80s Rambo is the only Rambo to me. And if you're anything like me i'd rather dig 21st century Rambo as far as possible into the ground.,Rambo - Last Blood

Mostly of the movie feels more like ""Narcos"" than a Rambo movie, the plot development itself it's just dumb and predictable with poor quality action compared to its precessor.

1101,theinvinciblefilms,"Very good action, meh story.",7,29 August 2020,"Rambo: Last Blood is the newest and most likely last film in the Rambo franchise. This is my review of that film. When John Rambo's niece goes to Mexico and gets forced into the sex trafficking trade, Rambo has to rescue her and get revenge on the people who took her.
Now first things first, before this movie came out I had only seen First Blood Part 1, but I watched the second through the fourth movies the day before Last blood came out in preparation. Coming at them from a young and modern perspective I think that every single one of them are all exceptional films. And not just action films, because these films have a lot more to say than just being a big blockbuster action movie. First Blood is about a character that has been through hell for his country, and when he returns to his country he is not accepted and the public hates him. So when he is aggressively taken into custody and abused in a small Washington town where he is searching for his old friend he snaps and fights back. First Blood Part Two is about the fantasization of war and Rambo's regrets in the way the war went down, so he gets to go back and essentially win the Vietnam War. While that film also carries some of the messages from the previous film the next film, Rambo III is basically just another fantasization of war just like the previous movie with no real lesson. Rambo 3 is more of a revenge film just like all the others, but where it loses the commentary on the world it gains the addition of a sidekick in Trautman, which differentiates this movie because in all the other Rambo films he is almost always alone against his enemies. The 2008 Rambo is very different from the previous two films as it shows the deep trauma and pain that comes out of war. It's a very gruesome and raw film about war, whereas the previous two were a sort of glorification of it. And then we arrive at the newest Rambo film, Last Blood. First of all, this movie is not even close to as bad as some critics say it is. It is pretty boring for a Rambo film in the first third or so of the movie, but it also is the first time we get to really see John Rambo do something other than shoot people to death. However it really starts once Rambo's niece or daughter or whoever she is, dies, and then he finally has a motivation. From there it turns into some of the best action ever in the Rambo franchise. It's basically Home Alone but rated R. It makes you leave with really good thoughts about the movie because you just saw some amazing scenes and sequences. One standout scene that has already become one of my favorite action sequences ever was the tunnel sequence where Rambo sets up so many traps to kill the people who took his niece's life from him. Another amazing thing that happened was when Rambo literally ripped the main villain's heart out. Some problems with this movie was that it felt more like a Taken movie then a Rambo movie, which I don't really think I like, but it was at least not the same movie as the other four. All in all, this was a good enough movie that you should see if you love action movies and if you are a big fan of the Rambo franchise but if you don't really like gory action you should probably skip this one. I give it a 6.8 out of ten for quality and a B on the entertainment scale.",Rambo - Last Blood

The movie keeps you guessing how the villains pay for their sins until the end. Unlike Jigsaw, Rambo is still more a soldier than an engineer--the way it should be. While the graphic violence at times was difficult to watch, the excellent character development is what appeals to me the most. The movie does a great job in showing the very good reason that explains why Rambo went nut and the mysterious woman who seems to have saved Rambo for no apparent reason.

Rambo is brutal and there were definitely some creative deaths. Pretty graphic too, which is awesome. If you like the Rambo movies, you'll like this one. The acting was ok.

John Rambo showed heart and a true since of what's right and wrong with this world. Tried to make a norm life for himself and remaining family, but as usual Shxt hits the fan and we're left with Rambo trying to make things right. Spoiler free, but wow...you should be prepared that nothing is held back in this movie! You've been warned!!!!Pam and I loved the movie and found it quite interesting, and a movie that all 17 year old girls and boys should be made to watch.

1125,rambo78,A treat for the fans.,10,23 September 2019,"Just finished Rambo last blood and have to say it was everything I had hoped for. I grew up watching these movies so its important to get everything right, and I have to say they did. The story isn't at all complicated but doesn't need to be and basically serves as a launching pad for possibly the most psychotic version of Rambo we've ever seen. By that I mean that we get to see a version of Rambo that has finally found some small amount of happiness, (although he's struggling to keep a lid on the rage inside) so when this is taken away you know whats coming, and I can assure you its brutal. The bad guy's in this movie are pure evil and deserve whats coming to them, and I can honestly say that true vengeance is delivered and is 100% satisfying. The acting is spot on by all, especially Stallone, who gives us his most animalistic, slightly psycho Rambo yet, and you're rooting for him the entire time. Its a good finale for a beloved character and a real treat for fans of the franchise. 10/10",Rambo - Last Blood

1131,jaydenbandy00,Last Blood Ruined The Last Entry,3,24 September 2019,"Rambo: Last Blood opens with a thrilling sequence featuring an emotionally drained Sylvester Stallone. What starts off as a treat and worthy continuation to a beloved franchise, slowly turns into the one of the most disappointing films of the decade. The fifth installment features an unbalanced and poorly written script that abandons the messages, themes and entertainment values of the series. I'm fine with franchises taking a new direction, especially when it's five entiries in but you shouldn't have to sacrifice the character and story to do so. Overall Rambo: Last Blood does not respect what has come before nor does it offer a satisfying conclusion and that's why I will give this train wreck an extremely generous 3/10. If you are a fan of the John Rambo character and wish to see how his arc concludes, then please do yourself a favour and rewatch the fourth installment.",Rambo - Last Blood
1132,jacoboliver60,Another bad 5th installment of a Stallone's,1,22 August 2021,"Anyone who has seen this movie can agree this does not feel like Rambo. What Rocky V was to the Rocky franchise, this is to the Rambo movies. I'm seeing the pattern with Stallone's franchises... All the movies are great, but the fifth installments are ones you'll wish never existed.When you watch a Rambo/Rocky movie, you want to watch Stallone's character kick some ass! But instead they are just useless grandpas who don't get the spotlight as much as they should! This is a Rambo movie, and for the first hour he's barely involved.I can go on all day about what made this a let down from the rest of the Rambo movies, but some other reviews I've seen explained perfectly its missing pieces, so I won't go there. I just wanted to point out that every 5th installment of a franchise Stallone is in happens to be one of the worst movies ever! We went from First Blood, a story of war tackling the themes of PTSD, to Last Blood, which is just a tragic, needlessly gory, yet anticlimactic revenge story.

THAT movie was great. Even 2 and 3 were OK and after seeing this shit, even Rambo 4 is tolerable.

1146,nielivarez,Rambo's tunnel can not be penetrated.,7,20 April 2020,"Rambo Last Blood stays true to the series by showing the last heroic appearance by John Rambo while sacrificing a bit of action in favor of more character building.Last Blood is probably the most 'personal' of all its prequels in terms of story. It has a relatively slow start and may turn you off if you are here purely for gory action scenes.
On the other hand, this paced start allows us to see 'John the family man' which we haven't seen before. And this 'seeing new sides of Rambo' doesn't stop there and continues throughout the movie.As the movie goes on, you will encounter darkness and horror-like scenes which are handled very meticulously. Enough to imply, but not overdo to disgust.And in the last act, you get all those high-adrenaline action sequences which do get the blood pumping. This will lead the story to Rambo's tunnels which we saw in the trailer and a final showdown.In summary, Last Blood will not subvert you expectation which in this case is great, and I would even liken it Rambo 2008 except they have factored in Rambo's growth as a human being in the latter.Personal Verdict: If you are a Rambo fan, definitely watch it. If you aren't, you will probably still enjoy it as a very graphic gory action movie, but you'll have to wait for the movie to get there.",Rambo - Last Blood

1178,jbvonherb,Underwhelming,6,6 October 2019,"Last Blood exceeds in gore... And that's it. The story was trying to be an emotional trip for John Rambo, but I found myself not really caring about the people we were supposed to care about. Maybe if John Rambo was replaced with someone else for the family it would mean more, but his relationship with his new family felt out of place. It sucks what happens to the family, but since Rambo felt like he was just put in there for the sake of being there rather than going with his isolated preference it really dampened the emotional weight. There was a reporter and a priest (assuming he was a priest) at some point that actually had a better stories going, but there was only a few minutes for the reporter and maybe two at most for the priest. Had the story focused on Rambo being the reluctant hero again and helping those two survive the Cartel the story would have been better. So, very wasted opportunities there.
I will admit the last fight between Rambo and the Cartel was awesome, but the set up to it was kind of dumb. The way the property was set up it it gave the impression that Rambo knew he was going to have to use his property to fight bad guys in the near future via Home Alone style. It was cool, but the set up made no sense.
There isn't much emotional weight, the gore is upped (including a very disgusting interrogation scene and awesome traps), and the violence is typical of Rambo, so if this really is the last Rambo film then the franchise went out with a whimper instead of a bang.",Rambo - Last Blood

1182,RATED_S,Awesome.,9,21 September 2019,"Rambo. I know the times when it was shown in cinemax and I was awed by all the action and the sheer thrill whilst watching the movie.
At 73, The character of John Rambo suffering from PTSD is really well portrayed by Sylvester Stallone. He has connected us and convinced us that he is indeed Rambo. The character of Gabriella and her grand mother is well written in the plot and feels homogenous and it made us feel like that it isn't just a mindless action movie with the protagonist going all guns blazing.
Few of the instance like Gabriella going to Mexico was justifiable and predictable but that was all. It felt fresh and in an era of people who consider good as some drama with very thick plot and twists, it gave us a sense of nostalgia and reminded us that good hardcore action movies are still relevant and people prefer those too.
There were moments like Gabriella's death and her grandmother falling completely apart. But the last part of the movie where Rambo sets up all those traps made us practically giddy. The last action was really good and all of us felt like that we are 8 year olds again.
They made end so well, it was fitting end for John Rambo. A man who went to war all his life, died in a war.
Though the antagonist had a very little screen time, both of them portrayed the Mexican cartel really well. Ruthless men who care for money. The fact that we were happy for their death made us realized that they portrayed their character fittingly in that small amount of time.This is an action movie which was beautifully made. I don't know what critics want who gave it 33% and why should we believe them as they gave a nice review to a love story between a fish and a human. Anyways, this is a good movie and is worth your time",Rambo - Last Blood

1184,Foxinthebox1984,Mixed feelings,5,22 September 2019,"Being u huge rambo fan I had mixed feelings about this film. First thing il say is its nowhere near as bad as what the critics are saying but it's not great either. I've heard reveiws saying that the acting was bad and the scenes between rambo and Gabrielle seemed forced and cheesy and I can't disagree more, I thought the acting and chemistry between them was good. I thought the film was way too short, I would of liked more build up on the ranch, Gabrielle left for mexico about 10 minutes into the film, not enough character build up time. I enjoyed the middle of the film Even tho it was like taken it kept you on the edge of your seat. I watched the UK version and they had cut out the flood rescue scene at the start which was disappointing I'd like to know why that is? Was left slightly disappointed by the last battle, I thought it could of been longer and I didn't like the music rambo put on in the tunnels, would of been better if they kept playing the original theme, the last kill was way over the top to the point where everyone in the cinema was laughing, don't think that was the reaction the film makers was looking for neither! Couple of cheesy parts ruined it for me. It wasn't as gory as reviews have said neither, I thought the last rambo was more gory tbh. Overall a half decent film better than the critics reviews but not a patch on the 2008 rambo and left me slightly disappointed, it didn't feel like a rambo film too me. could of been alot better imo",Rambo - Last Blood

It was one of those movies that are etched in your memory and bring a bit of nostalgia every time I think of it. Many times sequels do not stand up to the original films that have that effect on you, but this film did not let me down. I went with my son for a night out to celebrate his 21st birthday and we both enjoyed it. I leaned over right before he had that chat with the pimp at his truck and said ""I hope they don't hold back"" and we both looked at each other after that scene and said excitedly,""Nope!"", at the same time. Too many film over think the ""political"" or cultural aspects of the day and come off as being contrived. This movie displays the rage that anyone would feel inside if this were to happen to their family in a way that makes you feel satisfied.",Rambo - Last Blood
1188,ReadBetweenTheReels,"With all my heart and soul, I wanted to at least like it.",2,27 September 2019,"Stallone's Trumpian border wall advert features horses, a lot of tunnels (and, therefore, tunneling, naturally), misogyny, and a final act which reminded me of just how good Home Alone is. The film's saving grace is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, yet that is simply not an excuse for just how badly constructed and incoherently messy Rambo: Last Blood is. All I asked for was a fitting send-off for a character who I have previously enjoyed watching on the big screen. Instead, the message is very clear; Stallone has run out of ideas. I'm not angry, I'm just very, very sad.",Rambo - Last Blood
1189,davidbegatsolomon,The very best.,10,25 September 2019,"The best film I have ever seen; alongside Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. The script is incredible; who would think of a cut back to the housekeeper at home, then praying, in the middle of such drama. And the script is real.. Sly Stallone is unbelievable: should be up for Best Actor. I would say Best Picture Oscar as well.. He shows intensity and intelligence; supreme skill and great great acting judgement.. The film doesn't pull punches, but none of it is gratuitous. Only 1hr 20: lean and mean... I have to go and see it again, it is so so good..Dan 'Special K' Friend",Rambo - Last Blood

1191,thankfullkarl,One of the best action films of the decade and a fitting continuation of the Rambo series.,8,2 October 2019,"The Rambo films are unique in that they exist on their own in the action genre. The character of Rambo develops with each movie and it is refreshingly free of any traces of postmodern glibness or self-consciousness.The latest film takes the idea of Rambo as a moral avenger and defender of women and runs hard with it. The acting is superb throughout. Stallone keeps getting better in films and his ability to hold the screen even while he isn't saying anything is used well here.The direction is tense, muscular and doesn't succumb to modern cinema's problem of overediting action scenes. The cinematography is the best of the whole series and they should keep the same cinematographer if they do another one.The one problem with the film is the over the top finale. Rambo has essentially been a mythical figure since the second film and he is much better when shown pulling off feats of endurance, strength and survival than emulating Jason Voorhees from Friday The 13th. The graphic nature of the finale is the film's only major misstep. Next time give him a villian or villains who are clearly superior to him and it's only through his resolve and willpower that he wins.I'm looking forward to another one as soon as possible.",Rambo - Last Blood

This film did not fill me with nostalgia and very little resembling the Rambo we grew up with .

1195,jonwilburtan,Not Very Rambo,7,24 November 2019,"While still entertaining due to its very gory and visual depiction of revenge, there are some weak points in how the film unfolds. The major weakness is that this is the most un-Rambo version of the series in the way the action unfolds and his lack of military skills in way of approaching some situations. Still, I do recommend people to watch it especially those who are a fan of the series. It is similar to the winding down of Rocky. Although in Rocky he passed the baton to someone else. In this film, he keeps all the aggression to himself.",Rambo - Last Blood

You can't finish the movie AND the franchise like that!' There was a burning and obvious question that had been left unanswered. That is, whether or not he will prepare a refreshing hot beverage at the end of that horrific ordeal of squaring-up all those Burmese warlords. Thankfully, the producers were sensitive to this agony of uncertainty of the audience, and a little over a decade later, the question was finally settled. After successfully completing a cheap introductory 'Just doing my job ma'am'-type act of heroism, we do indeed see Rambo being offered a coffee. Finally! We are not privy as to whether he was served the serious gourmet s**t, or whether it was merely the freeze-dried tasters'-choice, what we do know, is that since it was served in a mug rather than a cup, this evidence suggests it points to the latter.",Rambo - Last Blood

The story was pretty interesting, I actually thought he would go on a mission to save the girl and end up in a bloodbath and then save her or some final showdown, but instead its a different twist that she ends up dying and he then takes revenge.

Had zero Rambo feel other than he called himself John Rambo. Hastily put together, no back story as to why he has tunnels under his entire ranch where he ""found peace"". Or where his family came from. 3/4 of the movie was lazy dialogue drama followed by what felt like a 2 min preperation montage and 12 min of action which was the only thing that saved this movie from a 1 star rating. If they'd have called it anything else it would have been a straight to DVD release, but to call it Rambo is an insult to a great franchise. But much like the 5th Rocky this one will be forgotten.

1248,onsgly,"Excuses, excuses...",5,9 December 2019,"So while watching this film, I couldn't help but get the feeling Sly and his team just wanted to make a slasher flick using the Rambo character.
The story is basically Taken, with a little less nuance and a ton more blood (this is actually a good thing!). The first half drags as the film really wants us to care about the characters in John Rambo's quiet life. This was actually done quite effectively and Yvette Monreal does a great job with her character. Our antagonists are totally generic and probably too much time was spent with them for no reason. The inclusion of the journalist remains a mystery along with the Don as they add minimally to the story.
The last half of the film is basically Home Alone meets Jigsaw. They setup some traps, and show them going off. It's simple but effective. When our ""hero"" does come face-to-face with the villain though, some comedic stuff happens that I couldn't help but laugh out loud at for a good 3 minutes. It's almost worth sitting through the entire film just for that. It's bloody, it's gory, it has a little heart and one thing is still certain at the end...John Rambo is still the man!
The tonal shift can be jarring if you're not a fan of blood (although, then why are you watching Rambo) and the first half can be quite a slog if you're looking for action.",Rambo - Last Blood

1251,Nikostratos,SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE 10 YEARS AGO,7,4 October 2019,"I can't think of any actor in recent history that has maintained consistent interest in iconic characters than Sylvester Stallone. Both Rocky Balboa and John Rambo are characters that have been around for 43 and 37 years, respectively.Having said that, here are a few of my nitpicks with 'Rambo: Last Blood':
We all know that Sly has undergone appearance-altering surgery, as well as hair implants, which is fine. But his face looks too much like the actor and not the character, if that makes any sense. Surely the make-up department could have done something about his eyebrows and generally given him an 'older' appearance? I know that both Sly and John Rambo are well into their 70's by now, which would make having the same long hairstyle seem out of place. But I still think that he should have grown his hair out a little more, in order to give him the more unkempt look that Rambo has always had.The plot itself was pretty straight-forward, and quite predictable. It was honestly an amalgamation of too many movies, particularly 'Taken'.
As mentioned above, Sly is in his early 70's and despite the cosmetic surgery, his age cannot be dismissed as an important factor. This film should have been made right after 'Rambo', which would have made it a little more credible.",Rambo - Last Blood

I could relate so much, Having a 10 year old daughter myself, and the thought of losing her hit me hard! This movie stuck with me long after seeing it.Granted it is a tad slow on starting with the action, but it spends the time developing the relationship with Rambo and Gabriella. which hits you all the more hard come the middle of the movie.I love all the Rambo movies, but none have had such an impact as this latest installment!

The story is somewhat cliched and its something we have seen before in many films, at the same time it shows the age of the franchise when they have run out of ideas.
Music and sound design was alright.
Stallone as much as he is good, he is old and we can clearly see him struggling thru things whole thing.Overall, Not Great, Not Terrible.

Let's be honest, 2008 wasn't good either, but is miles ahead of this one. Crappy dialogue, plot holes, Rambo and everyone around him are dumb, incredibly short screen-time?! Rambo goes to Mexico with a pistol, no preparation, no anything... Well, except graphic gore which there is plenty of. And probably is only one thing worth remembering. For better or worse. Oh, and it incredibly looks like grittier rip-off of Taken with Sicario touches. That's how original it is.A utterly, utterly devastating way to end up franchise.

However, the power of love, family, and revenge motivate him to go full Rambo on those that would hurt those he cares about.However, where the movie becomes a bit weak is in some of the over superficial dialogue and the speed in which the movie gets to it's climax and then concludes. They should have developed the characters a bit more, improved the depth of the dialogue a bit more, and then maybe stretched the movie out another 20 to 30 minutes with substantive content fit for a Rambo movie.All-in-all, I really enjoyed the movie, was pleasantly surprised by some of the emotional depth, and would watch another movie in this great franchise it it were to happen.",Rambo - Last Blood

Stallone has still got it, even at his age, his role as John Rambo is IMO, thee bar for movie action hero's .. Period.
Bit slow paced at first which made me feel like is this a Rambo drama movie, however after watching it at least 5 times now lol, I Realised why it was done that way.
Not sure if im throwing in any spoilers as such, however i will have to put this review in the spoilers section just in case..
As the 2nd half of the movie is Brutal & Rambo improvises booby traps with modern materials, obviously from his experiences in Vietnam. It also has the best quote imo out of all Rambo movies ( I know, I know, its arguable as theres a few) but this is my favourite one personally

A few years later a Mexican step daughter arrives but that's not explained. So what does Rambo do in the final peaceful years at the family farm, he digs tunnels, lots of them all around the place. After some second rate acting and Rambo wearing a Donkey Jacket a lot, we get to the bad guys, a load of typecast drug dealers who for reasons not worth caring about, kill Rambos Step daughter. As you would expect, the following is a lot and I mean a lot of gore so much so that it makes the SAW movies look like they were made by Disney. Overall this is a terrible film that all involved should be very ashamed!!!",Rambo - Last Blood
1313,wizzard_bane,An unprepared Rambo ends up killing the bad guys,3,24 September 2019,"In the fourth installment of the series, Rambo lives on a farm and tries to be a good father figure to his teenage niece. When his niece locates her father in Mexico through a friend, she decides to pay him a visit and ask why he left her. Rambo asks her reconsider while her mother strictly forbids her from going ahead with those plans. In the end, the niece ends up in Mexico being kidnapped by human traffickers (á la Taken-franchise).It's funny to see Stallone using fragments from his Rocky character in order to portray Rambo giving good fatherly advice, as if Rambo hasn't really developed that part in himself.So Rambo goes to Mexico armed with a knife and a gun and, as the trailer shows, eventually walks right into a large group of armed men responsible for taking his niece. He demands they let her go and, unsurprisingly, they refuse. The bad guys take great offence of Rambo demanding they release his niece and decide to make an example of both of them, perhaps as to discourage similar acts from others. Indeed, they're not impressed by Rambo's forwardness or his courage to stand up to them, and they really have no reason to. Rambo barges in unprepared, without a Plan B, or having a bargaining chip. And his enemy doesn't stop to ask if Rambo has a sidekick, or what the heck his deal is. A couple of lines of dialogue is enough for everyone to know where they stand.And in the end, neither Rambo nor the bad guys seem to know what they're doing. There's no thinking involved, no strategy, just a bunch of guys being annoyed with each other, unable to predict each other's move.Some would say that Rambo doesn't need a solid story and rich characters to be good (and they would be wrong); and besides, the first Rambo movie managed to offer those things--but even if we are to focus on the action scenes alone, these fall short. A few gunshots and stabs here and there are wrapped up with Rambo's trademark of setting up traps, but his opponents are so uninspired that such complexity is not really needed.Rambo's enemy is too easy to kill, but, supposedly, Rambo prolongs their suffering to make a point. This takes away from Rambo's efficiency and adds adds nothing to the story.",Rambo - Last Blood

I also agree with other reviews that the dark places it takes you aren't entirely called for, but maybe by the end it's so OTT that it could almost be forgiven.
But it's a rip roaring slice of nonsense which is what I generally love and it delivers. I'm prone to switching off the nonsense fairly early on but this does what it says on the dog tags and it stayed the course.
For what it is, I think we can call it 'fun'. But worth investing an hour and a half in if action / revenge is on the menu. Rambo style. John Rambo double hard whatchamacallit.",Rambo - Last Blood

1323,thunderstruck-97954,This will be the last Rambo.,8,13 September 2020,"Rarely have we seen a 73-year-old kill villains as angrily and effectively as Stallone does in the orgy of violence ""Rambo: Last Blood"". The violent anti-hero of the 80s is back in full force, and shows that there is still gunpowder in this old gringo.
He may be a little older, more tired and gray-haired than when ""First Blood"" was released in 1982. But ex-soldier John Rambo is still tormented by memories of the Vietnam War, and always just as ready to pull out with both a knife and a bow if anyone deserves to learn a lesson .When we meet him in ""Rambo: Last Blood"", he has retired to a quiet life on a ranch. There he spends his days tending horses, being a father figure to teenage Gabriella, and digging underground passages - because you never know when you will need a tunnel full of explosives and ammunition. In the opening scenes, he volunteers at a rescue operation, to remind viewers of how John Rambo is: brave, fearless, maybe a little crazy but still a decent guy. Two people die, and he collapses. More memories from Vietnam come to mind.His niece Gabriella has just decided to go to Mexico and find her biological father. She defies objections and drives away, and then it takes no more than about a few hours before she is kidnapped as a sex slave. But you can have worse uncles than Rambo, so to speak. He arms himself and rushes out to make guacamole from the whole cold-blooded cartel.Yes, it will be violent. Yes, it will be bloody. Yes, there are a lot of graphic scenes where John Rambo chops off bones and breaks skulls, among other brutalities.The story, partly written by Stallone himself, does not complicate things unnecessarily. It is a refreshingly simple and straightforward act that goes from point a to point b, and then unleashes all the mayhem of the world. If the first half is ""Taken"" in replay, the second half is a child-forbidden remake of ""Alone at home"", where our main character rigs up death traps as if he were Jigsaw. The finale is sickly satisfying, with an emphasis on ""sick"", because can entertainment violence really be this entertaining.The fifth Rambo movie is also a nice tribute to one of the 80's heavy, quiet action icons that arouses nostalgia in the fans. Maybe also a goodbye, but who knows. Sylvester Stallone learns to return to playing Rocky and Rambo until the day he dies .",Rambo - Last Blood

It's just any not-so-well-done action movie with an unfortunate amount of logic flaws. Let's just name one by the numerous crossings of the Mexican border blood soaked Rambo does, with or without a nearly dead beat girl and his stolen identity card.

I now why some critics rate it low cause this movie is shockingly brutal. Stallone made this movie to showcase the brutality of violence and war and he basicly set a new standard with this movie.Its not John Wick over the top action, but you get to see every bullet hit, every punch land and what it does to a body. When Rambo got angry i was genuinly afraid for the villains in this. It felt very much real and Stallone played Rambo perfectly here. Its not a clever story, you could say its just a simple revenge movie but this is the first time ive seen action this real. Stallone deserves praises for this movie and its sad to see critics rate it low because of the simple story when the movie sets a new standard for action movies to follow.I promise you this, you have no idea how brutal and real this movie is.",Rambo - Last Blood
1338,bookofcowan,"It's Rambo, what did you expect?",8,23 September 2019,"I've never left a review on here before but after reading 'First Blood' author David Morrell's criticism, I felt a need to speak up. No spoilers here, FYI.For those not wanting to read many words: If you like the Rambo films, you'll love this. If you liked Rambo (4, 2008) you'll really love this one. It's a continuation of the story as laid out in its predecessor and does a decent enough job wrapping up the character. Exactly what I expected and did not leave me feeling disappointed.Could the plot/story have been better? Of course. This is a Rambo movie. You don't watch films like Rambo or Terminator or the such expecting Oscar-winning storytelling. This isn't a Tarantino film. It had enough that made logical sense and was believable and explained why we should care for Rambo.Violence: in 2008's Rambo, the violence was made a bit more realistic. I'm especially fond of when he jumps into the back of the Jeep and turns the mounted fifty cal down, disintegrating the driver. This movie turns the violence up a bit more, but for the most part it avoids the gore of torture porn films like Saw. The violence wasn't gratuitous-again, you're seeing a Rambo flick so you know there will be ample enough action-and it was only used where it was needed. They didn't just toss extra in ""just because,"" if that makes sense. At times, especially in the third act, it wa so sudden and, well, so violent that it had the audience chuckling. More of a ""holy crap, wow"" chuckle than laughter.For those who feel there are stereotypes in this film, I feel a need to remind them that this is a Rambo film. Yes, some in the cartel have gold-planted AK47s. Yes, tunnels underground were used at the border. Yes, these are stereotypes of cartels-reinforced by celebrated shows such as Narcos, I might add-but, again, this is a Rambo movie. The bad guys have always been stereotypes throughout the series. Everything from the redneck cops in 'First Blood,' actually. Even the Mujahideen, the brave warriors of Osama Bin Laden who aided Rambo in the third one, were stereotypes. That film's dedication at the end didn't age well, by the way.Look, if you are easily triggered by light use of stereotypes and violence, don't see this movie. But then you probably shouldn't have seen any and you should avoid films like the Fast and Furious franchise, which is absolutely overflowing with tropes, stereotypes and action.I loved this film but I know who/what Rambo films are and went into this aware of what to expect.A great entry into the series and, to be frank, probably the best way to wrap up the franchise without going completely illogical and unrealistic.",Rambo - Last Blood

It's a culmination of every injustice, every disappointment and every cauterized bullet wound channelled into revenge for one too many unwanted grievance. The camel's back has broken and it is blood that will pour through the flood gates.

The film doesn't appear to respect its legecy although there are strong moments - his opening equestrian scenes, some of the bared handed kills and the montage of clips from Rambo 1-4 over the end credits. First blood is such a feature of many 40 + year-olds' psyches and a film watched at least once every couple of years for the sheer pleasure of it - the traps, living of the land and the ""why are you pushing me' lines. A bit like Creed, I think this film needed to be made by a fan or maybe this is stallone's Rocky 5 in the blood franchise and like he did with Rocky Balboa, Stallone will come back with a better reinvigorated rambo.

But the simple truth is that it could be good enough to save one person you like very much. And sometimes this is not possible.
So they not talking about Rambo like a hero or a killer machine, He is a broken person. Can't escape the violence. Whatever he do. And now this last blood movie show us the ugly truth of death.

They've become a tight knit family over time. He's still dealing with his PTSD from his time in the military, but keeps a lid on it.Not long after it looks like they are living a good life, the young girl he has raised as his known has gone missing in Mexico and Rambo must get her back.The story takes a few unexpected turns and the action is there too.

If you can't handle violence, watch a Disney movie and write a review on that. This is Rambo. Not some drama movie. Even though the plot is thin, the action is a little bit over the top this time when compared with Rambo (2008).I have been waiting for a sequel since 2008 and I have to say this was so damn brutal and satisfying because Rambo is a one man killing machine and that's what he does best.

1369,nightjay-74528,The legend had a not so legendary Ending,5,22 September 2019,"OF course I LOVE Rambo and his history of films since i began watching them in the 80's. But this Rambo movie took a left turn a bit to far into a twisted plot that just doesn't make sense as from most critics i have heard say the same thing.Where to start: Right when i saw the plot of the movie I knew what it was mostly going to be about. It seemed the actress who plays ""Gabriel, his niece"" was the main actress of the film next to Rambo. The only time we got to see the main actor ""Rambo"" do his thing was really the end of the movie the last 15mins where he got revenge against the Mexicans.This really isn't a Rambo movie except for the last ""15mins"" when he was in his element. I understand Rambo wanted to give this movie more about his family than himself but the movie was dragged out way too long to reach the climax.It seems the movie was more about his niece than him and more about how bad the situation was in Mexico. The movie spent to much time trying to depict how his niece was kidnapped & tortured and sold into human trafficking and slavery. I feel this movie was more about human trafficking of his niece and very little to with Rambo. It's like great i already knew what the movie was going to be about when i saw the plot when it said ""his niece was kidnapped by the Mexicans."" but i still had to see it because it was Rambo movie.Overall: I give it a 5/10 when really it should be a 3/10 because it was more about his niece being tortured & kidnapped and human trafficking in mexico than about Rambo. But it got a 5 more so the respect of Rambo and his past movies being so good. Thanks for the the movie though i'll still probably keep it in my collection of the other Rambo movies . The movie was as expected to me due when i read the plot but was disappointed in the long run except for the last part of the movie. Although great performance though by Sylvester stallane as an actor when he's almost 80 years old, mad respect for you. Rambo will always be one of my main idols.",Rambo - Last Blood

1373,roheflux,New Rambo: Vengeance in spades!,10,27 September 2019,"I read the reviews prior to watching this film and went in with low expectations. The critics fail again! I found Rambo: Last Blood to be a fresh action packed addition to the Rambo films.True to form in capturing John Rambo's desire for a peaceful existence while knowing and struggling to live in a world where people do evil things to one another. This film continues to highlight the combat scars he carries and the thin membrane that separates his peace and his ability to wage a one-man war.The new film skillfully replaces old foes with contemporary threats faced today with drug and human traffickers. Keeping to form, John Rambo is triggered and single-handedly shreds his enemies like a wood chipper -however - with much more brutality than seen in previous films! Tunnels, *BIG* knives, pungie sticks, and his archery skills are on full display in his war against the Mexican cartel!A film that does not shy away from the classic one man warrior hero who deals vengeance in spades. Rambo: Last Blood boldly avoids attempts to re-mold Rambo's character into something softer and does not disappoint the fan of this genre. Advice: Stay through the credits!",Rambo - Last Blood
1374,kkilmeister,2 people you do NOT likw off... John Wick and John Rambo!,9,23 September 2019,"The buildup to the end is somewhat text book, but I really connected with Rambo's inner turmoil. How he's tried to shed the war he's been fighting since Rambo First Blood til now and how it still bothers him to this day. He's more down to earth in this movie though, with a family, a home, horses that he takes care of and he's somewhat stable, and errr keeps himself busy (Digging tunnels and building an arsenal of weaponry), haha.
But the slow build up to the end and how disturbing it is is so gut wrenching and left me so heartbroken for the soldier just trying to live a normal life. It makes you understand why he goes so over the top in the way he disposes of them. That's where the critics don't get it. They say it's to gory and over the top, well shit, how would you like it if your daughter-like family member got kidnapped, tortured, raped and drugged to death?? The way Rambo disposed of those animals was fully warranted and the way he does it was masterful!

1380,slaversugizo,Must Watch : Last chance to see the iconic Rambo on film,8,24 September 2019,"Review RamBo Last BloodThis is the 5th arc of Rambo francised movies and it's 11 years since Rambo4 on the theatre. The movie has 1h30Mins lenght which was taken the first 1 hour to drama. I think it makes sense becoz we dont know how Rambo live during 11 years. Rambo still haunted from Vietnam war . There are few characters on Rambo Last blood. Rambo wants to live in peace at his old age. Sly still did awesome to story with logic. I think it makes sense why Rambo has to be killer machine again. In the last 30 mins , we see killing as Rambo style. Most weapons made by Rambo himself. Extreme violence scenes , shot in the head, villain has his leg cut off, Sly got knife wounds on his face. Sly takes villain's heart out of his body whole he lives.Drama scene , Sly did great. I almost cried when his niece died and Sly presented his feeling of losting. He cannot save anyone. Every people that he love already gone.The weakness just Rambo seem to get ready to fight all the time, he had underground area under his house to do weapons and being killer.
Villains were easily death.This is will be great movie for Rambo fan.
It's real. It's real dark and I love this movie.",Rambo - Last Blood
1381,paul-29841,Hang in there until the end.,6,24 September 2019,"This movie was hard to watch in many parts. Being a huge Rambo fan, the suspense and overall theater from First Blood was really never created again.
Sylvester Stallone has always been good at creating musical masterpieces with his movies from lock up, first blood, rocky and the list goes on.
It just seems now it is based on shock factor with far fetched blood lust.
The movie tried to be a combo between Taken and Equilizer. Unfortunately not up to either of those movies.
It is also extremely strange to see him as a Cowboy horse whisperer. Just doesn't fit the Rambo profile at all.
The movie moved along to quickly with very little character development.
It just quickly got into a last part of the film with a blast of action. In saying that, there were some really cool stunts in there.
Being the last film, it could have done with more flashbacks of the older movies.
They wouldn't have been out of place at all.",Rambo - Last Blood

This movie was everything I wanted it to be. The depth and dimensions of this character are obviously not understood by some of these critics.This is not a commentary on a particular culture, forget all that. This is John Rambo seeking revenge and carrying out and putting on display all his anger, all the betrayals he has faced and avenging the murder of one of the only people he ever possessed feelings for.It is actually a tragic film about repeated loss and trying to quiet that sleeping lion inside all of us and trying to find peace in the absence of love and family.It made me sad that the only solace he found after a life of hate, and bloodshed was stripped away and once again he ends up alone. I was quite emotional at the end of this film. All the revenge felt amazing and satisfying but my heart still breaks for John Rambo.",Rambo - Last Blood

1398,NRWest89,Old School Action,10,3 October 2019,"I won't lie to you, soon as I read plot story for a new Rambo film, and after RLB received negative reviews from so called professional critics, in my mind immediately appeared thought why is like that. I knew right away, this movie is going to be awesome. You may ask yourself why, and I'll let you know. This film deals, in large part, about human trafficking from Mexico. So basically you can get the idea why new Rambo got such a harsh reviews. In these times, you are not supposed think the way you want, but rather what media serves you. Once you go against their narrative, you are labeled with a lot of titles and you stick out as a sore thumb. I didn't mean to politicize film review, but they left me no option. Now as for the quality of the film, I can tell you that you don't have to expect Matrix style plot. If you go to see a Rambo movie with expectations of a plot from Quentin Tarantino flick, and you get disappointed, then excuse me, but you are dumb. This is old school action movie and it is made as such. Stallone is simply brilliant as one of the most iconic action characters ever put on big screen. We who grew up in the age of action films of the past decades will know. It's our legacy. Rambo Last Blood is a film about revenge. It is also a middle finger to the PC culture we're living in. It's about justice and doing what is right. It's simply beautiful. Legendary score, brutal action and specially ending credits will give you tears in the end! I know this is supposed to be truly last one in the series, but I wholeheartedly hope to see one more! Rock on Sly! 10/10.MW",Rambo - Last Blood

Well, I'm not faint hearted when it comes to blood, but this movie had waaaay too much unnecessary detailed blood scenes. It feels like they said ""...just throw them buckets of blood on their faces and they will be fine..."" sad to say, I expected more from the last Rambo.",Rambo - Last Blood

1409,dcipledude-03404,Rambo the soldier has left the building,2,1 December 2019,"War-torn Vietnam vet Rambo has left the building and is replaced by a psychopath, in a nutshell that's what you get with Rambo 5. He's living on his deceased father's ranch together with the housemaid and her granddaughter who Rambo treats like his own child, fair enough. Then you get to see a labyrinth of underground tunnels on his ranch, apparently built by Rambo and he seems to be sleeping there too. Why you ask ? No explanation given. Then bad things happen to the girl and Rambo rushes to Mexico to get her back. Here's where Rambo v2019 steps in : he acts like a moronic father, entering a Mexican cartel's lions den without arms whatsoever and gets into trouble, when he finally finds the girl he acts like someone who has never heard of 1st aid etc. So Rambo seems to have forgotten all of his advanced military skills .. or has he ? For some reason he often clenches his fists and looks very constipated, I guess that's how we are reminded that Rambo is still fighting inner daemons ? Anyway, this movie runs 90 min and only in the last 20 min do we get some action : Rambo suddenly remembers every deadly military boobytrap in the book and as a result the whole cartel is cut into pieces and every single one of the victims is shot in the face by Rambo but why ? Why do that when they are dead already? The gore in this movie is what we can expect these days, it is Rambo-esque but the way Rambo kills the final bad guy is so over the top, that's when I decided that Rambo has turned into a psychopath. A sad way to end the franchise. Oh and Sly a suggestion : you are starting to look like your mother so please turn to de-aging cgi ..",Rambo - Last Blood
1410,tcallender-27781,Loved it from beginning to end,10,5 December 2019,"I give this movie a 10. With out a doubt first blood is the best followed by first blood part 2.

Granted I'm a big Stallone fan and love the Rocky's and the Rambo's, so I'm alittle biased and I have daughter's and the sex trade is real unfortunately. It would be awesome to have a hero come along to say enough of this!. So my emotions really got envolved with this latest telling of Rambo. I cried in the middle and I felt Stallone's performance was Oscar level. My dad's a Vietnam vet and I seen this performance as true as it can be. Thank you Stallone for another great movie I can add to my personal collection. Hopefully the evolution of Rambo isn't done yet.....part 6?",Rambo - Last Blood
1411,chrenner,Too sad it had to end this way,1,8 December 2019,"There's nothing Rambo about this movie apart from his name. The only combat he sees is just a splatterfest of 5-10 minutes where everyone seems to be completely idiotic with no combat skills.

1417,nevilleraper,First blood to last blood...there's buckets of it..,7,21 December 2019,"Rambo Last Blood Cert R Run Time 89mins
Now before I start, I must confess that I do have a soft spot for old Sly and when I say old, I mean old. At 73 this is a more reflective John Rambo.I was a big fan of First Blood the denouement of a damaged soldier cast aside by the society he fought for, I thought that this was particularly poignant. The following three films were diluted down to cartoon superhero vs foreign baddies. I found them a bit like a pot noodle, tasty but ultimately lacking substance.In this film he's back in the old USA, has found himself a small ranch, a Hispanic housekeeper and has become a surrogate father to her young granddaughter.In his spare time, he likes to train horses, have war flashbacks, build tunnels and fashion big eff off knives... (imagine that as your profile on Match!)So, without spoilers, the young girl decided to go to Mexico to find her real father and this is where the trouble starts.The story, such as it is, then leads him on a rescue mission into drug cartel land. The finale takes place back at his ranch where those naughty Mexicans, who went under a tunnel in Trump's wall, turn up to marmalise our mate John. Cue what appeared to me to be a very messy version of Home Alone. Each baddy is dispatched in a more and more inventive fashion with home made killer traps. They are so good in fact I think I'll design one for my shed... Crimewatch my %rse.Oh, and yes, he does get to use his bow and arrow.This is a slow starter of a movie and be warned there are a lot of subtitles when John gets down to Mexico.In conclusion originality is missing from this film, and when boiled down is nothing more than a generic revenge story. What rises it above, slightly, is the nostalgia felt for the character and Mr. Stallone. This may be Last Blood but there Is certainly buckets of it...",Rambo - Last Blood
1418,infothreeb,Rambo - Sad Blood,3,28 December 2019,"Okay, let me say upfront: I am a Sly Stallone fan and like a lot of his movies. But maybe that's exactly the reason, why Last Blood disappointed me so much.This movie is mix between 'Taken' - 'Narcos Mexico' - 'Home alone'.The very core of John Rambo is missing.The storytelling is very mediocre and boring at times, and then, things happen super fast.The loose ends get lost in the wind and to be honest, this sucks big time.I really was looking forward to this movie but now, I'm just annoyed by the outcome.",Rambo - Last Blood

I assumed she was his brothers daughter and her deceased mother was the brothers wife, but further into the story you find out she's not related to him at all. So again who are they to each other.

1436,windmike,"Ah well, it is what it is",3,2 January 2020,"No, this is not what any Rambo fan expects of the franchise. Compared to the previous Rambo movie, this doesn't live up to expectation on any level. As far as I do not want to write a rant, there are some really horrible aspects to this film. First 15 minutes leave you waiting for the plot to tighten, hopes high for a nice twist in directing and editing. Doesn't happen, though, sorry. The script might have been saved by good directing and editing, but I couldn't help myself feeling like watching a C class movie from back in the day. The score doesn't help as well - music, playing a huge role in creating the right atmosphere and vibe, fails dramatically here, leaving the viewer with a feeling of cheap orchestra-esque experience, far from what we are used to nowadays.
Getting back to the plot - I honestly do not mind a script that could be written on a napkin (if it's an action movie) provided the director sells it wells and the outcome is decent. Here, it's so not Rambo-style and it simply fails to deliver. It feels cheap, over simplified and stupid. The characters are not built convincingly, you do not feel any connection whatsoever to all the non-Rambo folks appearing on the screen.
Last comment about the violence - seems absolutely unnecessary and doesn't bring anything to the table. It's just there, not realy gore, but leaving the viewer with mixed feelings.

Sadly, I stayed for the end of Last Blood.There is nothing here of the haunted soldier from First Blood. Nothing of the man who just wanted to be left alone and resorted to violence only when there was no other option. Honestly, John Rambo would have been better off dying at the end of that film as the original author had intended rather than living for this. What we get instead is a flat, random tough guy who could be anyone.Spoilers followRambo is now living in Arizona on a ranch where there are no trees and he's built a network of underground tunnels that appear to go nowhere but criss-cross each other frequently and randomly. He lets no one go into them until the granddaughter of his housekeeper wants to have a party and show them off to her friends. It makes no sense at the time, and isn't referenced again.The girl goes on a hunt for her biological father who abandoned her when she was an infant. He's a bad guy as Rambo observes but she goes off to find him anyway. Many really bad things happen to her, so Rambo goes down to get her back, except he doesn't actually know what her situation is. He just dives right in with gusto and apparently a lifetime of bitter anger, maiming numerous people on his search for the girl. He wanders right into their stronghold and gets beaten severely by about 40 guys. This, as I said, is not John Rambo.He recovers and THEN decides to go after these guys in a surgical fashion. Where was this tactical expertise just a few days ago? He saves the girl, whose situation isn't good. He just left a woman who wanted to help him and who knew a doctor, but instead of trying to get the girl some help, he just proceeds to drive her home. She dies because he'd rather get her home than find her a doctor to get her some Narcan. Yes, she's dead because this Rambo is a moron.He goes back, provokes the bad guys with more killings and a decapitation which features our ""hero"" dropping a head out the window of his pickup by its hair only to bounce down the road as he speeds away. This of course draws them to our side of The Wall (which features in several scenes) and to Rambo's ranch before the big showdown in the tunnels. Many booby traps (but inexplicably, after each one triggers, there's Rambo delivering the death blow or some gratuitous extra bullets) later and we realize that the whole point of the tunnels was to have a place to fight random bad guys he might one day want to bring back to Arizona. Good plan.In the end, he blows the tunnels, goes all Temple of Doom on the lead bad guy, and literally rides off into the sunset.I felt degraded, nauseated, and disappointed. The dialog was worthy of an after-school special from the 70s. The shot selection wasn't much better. So many closeups. So many. The violence was right out of Hostel or Saw or any other torture porn film you might care to reference. I actually snorted out loud a few times though whether from revulsion or humor or just the whole absurdity of the thing, I can't be sure.This was not a Rambo movie. It had no soul, no depth, no gravitas. It was just a revenge & violence fantasy against Mexican traffickers & drug cartels with so many bad decisions from the good guys that the ending wasn't even remotely satisfying. It was just sad. Stallone could have played this character with any other name and it wouldn't have changed the movie. It might have sold fewer tickets, but the movie itself wouldn't have lacked anything for not having ""Rambo"" in the title.",Rambo - Last Blood

To me, it's ridiculous that people are crying out about the violence in the film when it's always been a part of the franchise. The problem is that people are putting their own political beliefs onto the movie.Who goes to a Rambo movie, Expects a Rambo movie, they get a Rambo movie and then are annoyed that its a Rambo movie?It's just eye-rolling to me and I think that IGN especially should have been more selective about who they chose to review the film, this person clearly gets offended by violence so no matter what happened in the movie, they were never going to enjoy it.",Rambo - Last Blood

I ll write a summary that includes what went through my head the entire film..
John is retired in Arizona. He has a ranch with a few horses and a couple miles of tunnels dug under it. Oh no I already know the ending.. He also sometimes helps the police with search and rescue because he still got it baby. He has a ""family"" now though that includes a teenage daughter who is a good girl btw no boyfriends. At 17 she discovers that the dad who left them lives in Mexico close to an old friend she had from school. We are warned though that papa is a scumbag and that friend is baad. Hmm She takes the car and decide to go. Just like that you ask? Yes! She passes the border and drives around Mexico. Is she allowed? Mexicos driving age limit is 18.. Oh but she arrived immediately.. her friend is practically next door how convenient.. She looks shifty and tells her life is hard here you got to do what you got to do.. I feel spoonfed tbh.. Dad lives in the neighborhood How lucky. He is a dirtbag though How unlucky. I thought friend would be a goner with the car but no she cool! takes her out to party and forget. Sleazy guy hits on her with no hope, drops something in her drink.. Watch your drink lady! Going out 101.. She is a sex slave now???!! Bruh for real... John leaves to find her because there is no law there and its an hour drive anyway. He goes to the dad asks him once about her whereabouts he replies he doesn't know and John leaves I guess we believe the dirtbag. We roast the friend though and he right! Takes John to the sleazball a female enters the story. Please no love story!! John grabs the sleazball in the parking lot asks him, he says dont know but we don't believe him.. he aint family I guess. Rip his collarbone What? Hardcore violence ok Im in.. takes John to a hideout oh shit he gonna kill the whole neighborhood City of god style. Sike! he gets cornered and beaten up practically without a fight.. daughter is being raped by the police downstairs..Mexicans are Donald said..Was that the plan though? He lives because bad guy doesnt want to stain the roof I guess But look said Donald some of them are good people.the female is also a commando she stealthily gets to John on the roof and stealthily gets him out. Is she a cop? .... journalist lul How are the traffickers make money beating and drugging the girls I dont get.John wakes from coma goes to a brothel with a hammer. Kills every man in sight and finds the daughter tripping balls. Bloody old man and beaten drugged young girl somehow pass border security..... She ded on the way, everbody sad except me. John gtfo the old lady and starts preparing for the Home Alone part. John noones coming they dont care for a single girl... jokes on me he goes back chops boss 1 head off. Now the cartel passes the border dressed like SWAT and attacks John. Fortunately they only have guns and john got some rakes scattered around and bad guys step on them and hit their head Cartoon style. John kills them all one by one but for the last one he has to demolish his foundation first.Then he almost eats his heart. The end",Rambo - Last Blood

I went without expectations because by the trailer it seemed one thing and i was pleasently surprised with this movie. It is violent, yes, but Rambo was never known for using his words to solve conflicts. One thing that bothered me in the previous movie was the abuse of special effects and on this one it's not that noticiable so point for that.
Regarding the story, it hits close to home but it doesn't overdue it. It may not gain any Oscar but then again those are all manipulated.

1466,summerhits2002,You 'aint seen nothing yet!,10,19 September 2019,"Forget The Expendables, John is back and how!Just when you may expect another RAMBO instalment to be moot considering the ferocity and seeming closure of the series with RAMBO in 2008, Stallone has marshalled a considerable range of new territory for the character to inhabit and executes it flawlessly.A myth regarding the Rambo series is the often mentioned lack of character development which admittedly is not as obvious as the Rocky series, but throughout the first four instalments, John Rambo has indeed covered his progressive emotional and psychological development with incremental glimpses of the changes he is undergoing and it's never been underscored so beautifully with Rambo:Last Blood.In an entirely new environment Stallone graces the audience with the opportunity to see Rambo among a family he loves and treasures immensely and never has his humanity and purity of spirit been better articulated. As a result, Stallone gives Rambo an unprecendented opportunity to be verbal and expressive rather than keep the occasional dialogue he would dispense in the earlier films. Whilst still haunted by the past; beautifully represented in one flashback; he has seemingly found the closest thing to peace in his life before the inevitable ""lid"" he's keeping on his demons is cast to the wind and he harnesses his considerable military abilities to enact a retatilation against those who destroy his new life.The ridiculous notion of a Taken/Home Alone scenario unfolding is so far from reality as to be ridiculous. This is not just action at it's peak but a reveal of a man who has never fired the first shot or ever gone looking for war and when the time comes; on his own turf for a change; Stallone imbues Rambo an intensity that just should be impossible considering what we've seen in the past. There is method to his anger and catalysts for his carnage and eclispes everything we've seen the character do before.Stallone has never been as affecting and vulnerable as John Rambo since the original and with that comes a few surprises for the audience. Stallone plays the role to perfection and graces us with another amazing performance that already has been sadly overlooked by the critics who simply consider the character itself to be not worthy of paying attention to regarding the more minute emotional aspects of the character.Had the film not lived up to be what it was for me, I'd be blunt about it but for myself and the packed house, who didn't even move during the end credits, Rambo:Last Blood delivers on more than just the expectant action sequences and intense violence. This isn't war for war's sake and an excuse to pander to expectations for it to be gratuitous for the hell of it, there is a method to the perceived madness.Stallone has done the RAMBO legacy proud with this latest film and all the rotten tomatoes and metacritics in the world cannot alter the fact that he has harnessed one of the finest motion pictures of his career.",Rambo - Last Blood

First blood will always be the Rambo that we all felt for and still love to this day. 2 & 3 were 90s action films and they fall into that category comfortably. Rambo (4) was a film full of violence that we rarely see on screen and a darkest desires begged for it. Last blood blends the heart of first blood and the violence of Rambo yet doesn't succeed. Johns character is defined by his past but we don't feel it like we used to. The stakes are high but only for a character we have moments to connect with. What her character goes through is that of nightmares but we aren't pulled in like we were with johns plights in first blood. Unfortunately we just don't care as much. This is where last blood doesn't land it.
Where it does get it right is with recreating the giddy violence of Rambo. Although stripped down to a basic ""come get me"" affair the violence really is what shines. The brutality is up there's with the best of Rambo and moments of just ""wow, really. That's nasty"" unfortunately it's no masterpiece but I suspect if you've been watching through to here, you'll get what you we're looking for.",Rambo - Last Blood

1479,gjdmstewart,This Ain't John J. Rambo Film,1,26 September 2019,"I am a huge Rambo's fan. Loved the character since the first installment of 1982. But Rambo 5 has almost nothing in common with John J. Rambo from First Blood and the later versions - 2,3 and 4.In Rambo: First Blood, John J. Rambo was a highly efficient Green barrette who had the misfortune to be on the wrong place in the wrong time and to meet the wrong people. He was pushed to the edge and fought his way back. But he wasn't savage and used violence only to stop violence, not for revenge.
Things got a bit messy in the second, third and fourth series. Still, Rambo killed only military personnel in a combat. He never lost his humanity until the fifth and supposedly last installment. Here he is brutal. He is savage. He uses his extraordinary combat skills for revenge. This is not the essence of John J. Rambo's character. That can be anybody else action character but not Rambo.I want to say a few more words about his physical appearance. Rambo 5 is ugly! He is so unattractive, it's hard to watch him. Whoever designed his make up, should be ashamed of themselves.If you have loved John J.Rambo's character, my advice is to skip the fifth installment. Rambo 4 had decent ending - he went home! I would have loved if he had died a hero and had a respectful send off by the state. That would have been my perfect ending of the saga. But I have accepted Rambo 4 ending. However, I cannot accept Rambo 5 finale - it's dumb. It opens opportunity for another film, which is bad idea. Stallone is too old to play an action hero. One must know when to sing one's Swansong!

Let Rambo come home, walking down that dusty road..where we left him, and let his war be over. Stalone said on his personal page. ""Great day! We got our HARD R rating today! What's coming is going to be unlike anything you have ever seen...""
And he was right.. It IS unlike anything seen before.. No other (Rambo) movie are THIS bad..
It could have been SO awesome, SO much potential .. But ""The Sly"" grew up, Rambo went home.. And we should have him have that peace.. Let his war be at an end..
But instead another, pointless ""war"" was declared.. And like in Vietnam, this one was a lost cause too.. This one, like 'Nam, was more for the sake of greed than honor. Even the fight scenes (if you can call them such) feels more like punches in a pillow than a bag of wet sand (or raw meat,) like we was treated to in the last movie ..
Like the Vietnam war.. this, is just a thing nobody really was prepared for, and willing to admit defeat when it was plain to see..

1528,dragslow-67-217485,One Star for Sylvester,1,3 December 2019,"Movie Review:
I'm a big time fan of Rambo series, I was following last blood from very long and hoped that it would be better when Rambo (2008) went beyond my expectations. But this movie was a total failure when it comes to story, script writing and even action. Rambo franchise was not always about blowing up body parts into pieces or being chopped up, it too had a story, action and tactical stealth. Compared to all Rambo movies before Last blood had just action in it.
Flaws in Story and Script writing:
1) I lost it all when I first saw that Rambo had few dialogues with Gizelle and the father and believed them without waisting another minute with them. His father says he doesn't know where is she, Rambo says okay slams his door and leaves. This does not happen in real life, if it were a long scene then I would have thought that he must have interrogated but it was all one scene
2) Yes we all liked when Sylvester beats Drago in the Rocky IV, all bruised up with swollen eyes. But the swollen eyes in just two minutes after he gets a bad beating by the Mexican gang?? . And not only this, 4 days later he gives his come back with accelateted healing, yes he is a soldier who has more will and courage than a normal man but how did he manage to heal the scars that he had on the eyes. I had a fight when I was 20 and I had few bruises on my face which took like a week to heal and the scars took like forever.
3) It was a jaw dropping action when Rambo in 2008 rips the throat of one of the bad guys, which shows how much angry he was, but this movie was all about bare hand ripping, wasn't it like too much, I lost the charm of ripping
4) Appeared to be a low budget movie when when the bad guys went down into the tunnel with laser sights. The Laser sights were not real and even the CGI appeared not to be real at all.
The above were few of the things amongst many, but again it's Sylvester you outta watch itAgain, I am a big fan of Sylvester and no hard feelings for the ones who gave 10/10, it's just my opinion, that I am not getting back my 1:41 hrs of life. Ciao",Rambo - Last Blood
1529,Lasidora,Fan Bloody Tastic,9,6 December 2019,"I watched this expecting it to be a cash in title for Stallone, you know trying to grab a few final bucks from the franchise before it fizzlels out for good, but damn! was I suprised, top notch action, blood & gore galore, & man does Stallone dish it out as well as take it, you have got to hand it to the man, he's 73 now & he just doesn't know how to retire quietly, so - watch it, switch off your brain, & watch the body count rise, the end scenes are a joy to watch, I just hope there is a follow up such as "" Rambo Last Blood After Transfusion"" so he can keep his legacy going, a massive thumbs up from me.",Rambo - Last Blood

1533,ernesto2048,Rambo Lives!,9,24 September 2019,"I felt compelled to write this review after reading the backlash this movie has received of being racist and unnecessarily violent. I'm Mexican, I saw this movie in a cinema obviously filled with Mexicans.. no one felt offended!!!! Everyone was cheering towards the end and that final montage hit the feelings note perfectly. Rambo is a character embedded deeply in Mexican pop culture as well as in many other countries, and it hurts me to say it, but the villains you see in this movie is a reality that happens in my country, if anything I congratulate Stallone for denouncing that criminal activity. It's not a perfect movie, and it does have a different feeling than the other ones, but when Rambo finally appears you'll feel it and at his most cold blooded self he can be, the violence while gruesome, I didn't feel it unnecesary especially if you know how this Criminal Bands operate. So go to the cinema, enjoy this movie for what it is, and feel secure that south of the border we are ohh so happy to have another Rambo movie and no one is feeling offended!!",Rambo - Last Blood
1534,Mwylks,A necessary message,8,17 December 2019,"The most unfortunate thing about Rambo last Blood is not that it was made...but that it had to be made. some will decry it's ""unnecessary violence"" and hurl unsubstantiated accusations of ""racism"" at the Director and Stallone. The film's frank and uncomfortable depiction of the slave trade is shocking but then it should because it happens to be reality. The Cartels who are the purveyors of nearly all crime particularly the northern part of Mexico are the antagonists in this film and meet a justifiable and fitting end.
It is not a feel good movie but it does stir the heart and emotions. This film needed to be made. It sends the right and proper message and was well done, well acted and well directed.",Rambo - Last Blood

1543,jeffandtan,Wow. Just Wow.,4,1 January 2020,I wasn't expecting it to be good. I was expecting it to be what it was and yet I was disappointed. Sylvester Stallone is a 74 year old man that is worth $400 million. He has obviously made some brilliant decisions. This isn't one of them. I don't even mind The Expendables but I don't think that John Rambo needed his last film. This film should be avoided and Sly Stallone should enjoy his bankroll.

1545,williamsjoshuaray,Last Ride,8,21 September 2019,"Rambo: Last Blood... I am a fan of Rambo and Stallone in general. I also think he has made some pretty bad films (Ex: Escape Plan 2 & 3, Backtrace most recently). I mainly watch his films just for the action and machismo with the exception to the Rocky series. With that said, this films action (which is the last 10-15 min of the movie) is brutal, over the top and in your face. Some of the gory violence could be comparable to the Saw movies. I honestly expected no less after the 4th Rambo film. Last Blood is to short of a film and feels very rushed. They take little time to build characters or help fill in the gaps between Rambo 4 and Last Blood. The PTSD felt forced and could have been improved with flashbacks from previous films. Some of the narrative would have been better if it was lines from previous films spoken by Colonel Troutman. Have just left the theaters, I'm still trying to process what I watched and struggle with signs of the Original Rambo in this updated character that is aging. I feel they tried to take a Logan approach but it got lost somewhere in the editing. If you see this film see it for what it is... an in your face, brutal flick. There is nothing to take away from it and no improvements on the character Rambo. The movie itself almost feels like the character... lost and spent. At leave they pulled a Shane and he rode off in the sunset.",Rambo - Last Blood
1546,matchsticktown,Rambo-ish,7,26 September 2019,"Being a huge Stallone and Rambo fan I was extremely excited for this film, the character of Rambo has always fascinated me due to his struggle to integrate with society and allow his past to be his past, the film starts with John Rambo living on a farm with his only remaining family, things go south which causes John to become involved with some nasty people and ultimately ends in an epic showdown, although this was an excellent action film I never felt the connection to the previous films in the series and felt that this could have easily been a stand alone movie, no flashbacks, no mention of his past, no mention of the previous films, all of which I found very strange as Stallone is an expert at connecting a franchise even in the most subtle ways,Rambo last blood is a brilliant action film, however it didn't feel necessary to the Rambo series.",Rambo - Last Blood

1550,sethnt,A film that fails to represent what First Blood even meant.,3,21 September 2019,"Rambo: Last Blood is another bad action film, the cinematography is painfully bad, the story has bad pacing and plot holes, and this film sets up a terrible dynamic with all of its characters. Much of the action is this film is done like a shaky cam film from the 2000s. The story leaves many plot holes of how Rambo finds places or how characters end up where they are. Every scene in this film just happens very quickly and changes tone and place so fast that the cohesion between shots becomes painfully hard to follow. This film's positive point is that the over the top violence proved to be entertainingly silly which leads to this films biggest problem as a final note for this franchise. The original ""First Blood"" is a very non-violent film, many of the characters in the film are hurt but never killed, this shows Rambo as a human in distress and not some killing machine. This film just makes him go around killing everyone even before the last straw is pulled. This films tries to be a fun action flick with a heart like the original film, but comes off as a bad action flick that betrays the original film's ideas.",Rambo - Last Blood
1551,aqp-83513,An impressive display of unbridled rage!,8,6 October 2019,"Much like the previous installment, the gore has been ramped up to reflect a man at the pinnacle of teetering on the brink of losing his humanity. Once pushed over that edge, we see a man with nothing to lose, equipped with the skill sets necessary to exact the worst of revenge. Although cliche to a certain extent, it is interesting, if not as a character study, to watch what a man is capable of given the right push into the descent of unbridled rage! Honestly, based on the reviews gleaned, I wasn't expecting much, but for some reason I found the gore factor befitting to such a franchise, and even necessary, to display the cumulative affect of violence in a man's life. All the parties involved churned out a solid effort, and I would highly recommend a theatrical viewing for full visceral effect.",Rambo - Last Blood

After clearly being given a half assed script, terrible dialogue, and a touch of the Prima Donna that is Stallone; he's still managed to thread it all together into an absolutely cracking film. To listen to the audience, cringing, wooping, laughing, covering their eyes as bones are cracked, through to being overcome by uncontrollable action movie nostalgia is something I've not been a witness to in a movie theater for a long long time! I think it really helped that expectations were low from the audience at the outset to the film. I mean that really is the way to get at an an audience, take them unawares, play with their emotions and methodically mould those emotional highs and lows into a cinematic journey. It is a skill and Adrian's clearly mastered it. It was truly effortless cinematography from start to an incredible finish.I can't wait for Adrian's next film... maybe he should hold off hitting up Arnold just quite yet... He could instead get on with stepping up to actually taking full control directing an episode in the next Narcos Mexico series??? He would smash it! Well done Adrian!",Rambo - Last Blood

I wish they would also realize that their job in the Internet era is about as useful as gas pumpers! They shred this movie, but I guess violence is only acceptable in a plotless Tarantino movie (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood)! They should get a real job! My boy Stallone knows his fans! Thank you, Sly! Loved this movie and love Stallone's comeback in last 2 decades! I hope there's a Rambo 6 film just so that Rambo can massacre a bunch of film critics at their wine-and-cheese tasting party! This movie picks up where last left off and is straightforward and really maintains the character well! Then, of course, Rambo takes bloody vengeance on those who dared to cross him (personally this time)! What more could we want?! Shut up, critics!

It left me with more disappointment when I watched this movie. While I was watching, I noticed some cheap shot scenes, some.very low cost one, finding the script quite of low standard. Rambo who used to be a real fighting machine, turned out to be a failed guardian who couldn't even save his niece. And the journalist came out for no reason helping John. I mean nothing went good for this movie at all. Stallone's career is finished I guess unless he finds a real good director. I believe when Arnold can do a great movie in such age 'The Last Stand' why not Stallone can do. Stallone is my all time favorite hero but now for the last releases, it's quite disappointing for me.",Rambo - Last Blood

Please do not get discouraged by critic (especially liberal critics using the words ""Trumpian"" and ""MAGA"") reviews. The last 45 minutes of this film are jaw dropping. I have never seen this type of choreographed violence ever before captured on film. It goes by fast, is shocking, entertaining, and extremely satisfying if you are a Rambo/Stallone fan. In my opinion, it is a better movie than Rambo 3 and 4. The acting was improved from the last one (2008). If I had to be critical about anything it would be that some dialogue was cut out to keep the movie moving at a fast pace, and not have the first half of the movie run too slow. However, I really feel that this is an epic movie, perhaps the best revenge film ever made.",Rambo - Last Blood

1587,john_zoet,Movie with 2 faces,7,20 September 2019,"Rambo: First Blood wasn't just an action movie. Foremost it was a movie about a Vietnam-veteran who struggled with PTSD and picking up his life in a hostile environment: post-Vietnam-war America. Rewatching the movie you see it's all about an ex-soldier who can't get the war out of his head.Rambo 2 and 3 were completely different, making Rambo just another action-hero. The emotional development Rambo made in the first movie, was completely thrown overboard to make 2 of the best action-movies made in the '80's. I love them both, but in hindsight they seem really out-of-touch with the first movie.In Rambo: Last Blood, we meet Rambo, back in America again. He tries to save some people from extreme weather-conditions, which leave him struggle again with all the people he knows from the war he couldn't save.
We find out that Rambo is a surrogate-father for the 18 years old Maxican girl Gabriella. Gabriella goes out on a mission to Mexico, to confront her real father on why he left her and her mother. Rambo strongly advises her not to do that, but she sneaks to Mexico anyway. There she is taken by a mexican drugcartel who want to sell her as a hooker. Rambo goes on a rescue-mission to save her, after which the drug-cartel is coming to Rambo for revenge.The first part of this film is quite emotional. There is some real bonding and chemisrty between Rambo and Gabriella. Rambo struggles again with the dark side of his mind and his distrust of society. The emotional first half is, unfortunately, nothing more than a set-up for the second part of the movie, which is full of great Rambo-action. The action is awesome, but doing nothing with the emotions from the first half, makes that it lacks tension. It is cool to see Rambo back in action again, but it doesn't make you feel for him really.
The action on the other hand, is very graphic. There is an abundance of blood and bodyparts, which is why everyone wants to see a Rambo-movie, ofcourse!So, a 7 out 10 for me. Not great, but way better than I expected!",Rambo - Last Blood

There were a couple of shots that were obviously green screen and edited really badly which stood out like a sore thumb. Later there was a scene with infa red beams from riffles that looked so fake due to a shady transfer mode on the lazers. Some of the fight scenes were very highly speed ramped that looked awful, not stylish at all and looked like they were trying to hide something.Once the edits started to let this movie down I lost interest, I wouldnt normally expect this level of poor editing from a a Stallone movie.

In 2008 I did not have the opportunity to watch Rambo VI in the movies and although I agree that he had closed the franchise with a golden key, I was one of those who did not find the release of this sequence anything bad, because finally I could see on the big screen of my favorite characters.If it was with another actor and another time, Rambo Until the End would be just another action movie, but no, there's Master Sly and what may be a farewell to one of the thickest shell characters in cinema. I'm not going to highlight the script here, because I don't really care about that, but it would be unfair not to say that, in fact, Statham's Front Line was the script that would be adapted for Rambo, the one with an adjustment here, another there, changed a few things and got good.The movie is fast and wastes no time , but it catches some feeling that the Vietnam veteran supplies for the people around him. It was nice to see the tribute to other films in the franchise and the parts where they played glimpses of the original movie soundtracks are chilling. The director was able to deliver both good-looking and good-looking action scenes to old Sly's current physical ability, the harmony was great. The violence came full plate just like in Rambo 4.Anyway, it was so worth the tribute and the opportunity to see one of my favorite 1980s movie heroes on the scene again. From that pang in my heart just imagining a movie timeline and knowing that this may have been the last, but that's how life goes.""It's a long road when you're alone and it hurts when they shatter your dreams ...

This has been the first movie in many years that I have genuinely enjoyed.I walked out of the theater with a smile on my face . This is not your typical Marvel or DC action movie that gets over-hyped by critics and when you watch it you think its average at best, or you think to yourself, what the heck did I just watch?
Rambo who you can tell has a good heart, wants to be a good uncle, hopes his beloved niece enjoys her life and goes off to collage, he only wants wants best for her and gets upset against bad people... Aka the cartel who do bad things.... they messed with the wrong Green-Beret and he makes them pay..
There are bad people all around the world, and for the sake of this film they happen to be in Mexico. ( I don't understand how critics say this is xenophobic, Rambo isn't going to kill innocent people... only taking revenge against bad people?? (what is wrong with these critics?)John Rambo Last Blood, you can expect to sit in your seat and be entertained the entire time.

Your tolerance for this will probably entirely depend on your opinion of previous entries in this franchise.
I consider myself a Rambo fan, primarily just for the original First Blood, the rest I can take or leave, usually leave and I mostly enjoyed this one but I am highly unlikely to ever watch it again.
Bit of a slog to get through the first hour or so but the climax really delivers, with excessive gore and decent action in an intriguing setting, that will have fans of this sort of thing punching the air and giggling like loons!
So, if this is your cup of tea or you're already a Rambo fan, I,d recommend it overall, just don't go expecting greatness. If you're not a Rambo fan or an avid viewer of excessive 80's action schlock, then stay far, far away!",Rambo - Last Blood

1629,manbat,Rambo Resurrection,2,14 December 2019,"To put things in perspective I loved the Rambo movies but he should of never been revisited, this movie is not John Rambo it just doesn't sit right even though S T is back something is off, watch it see what you think but my opinion is the legacy should of been un touched, real shame but that Hollywood for ya.",Rambo - Last Blood

1632,arnaudkaplan,Why did they have to do a fake Taken?,5,14 April 2021,"Was really hoping for more for the Last Rambo. Why did Gabrielle have to die, we'd hope that the old Rambo would have found redemption. You don't have to suffer this much to be a hero. Many things don't make sense in this movie, why didn't Rambo go with Gabrielle to meet her father, why did he go alone in the favellas the first time without a plan and unarmed, how did the Mexicans cross the border with so many guns... the only thing I liked was how he carved the heart out of the guy's chest at the end.",Rambo - Last Blood
1633,surferbg,Classic Rambo movie with graphic violence on the next level.,7,24 April 2020,"The movie is everything I expected. The last one was bloody, but they manged to take this one on the next level. The story line is nothing special, but it manages to get you to want all of the bad guys dead. Very entertaining with lots if action - classic Rambo movie ;)",Rambo - Last Blood
1634,zck-68576,Last Blood (Extended Cut),7,28 May 2020,"If at all possible, try to view the extended cut. When I initially saw the theatrical cut, I felt as though many of the emotions were glossed over. The extended cut makes this a complete film.Extended Cut: 7/10
Theatrical Cut: 4/10",Rambo - Last Blood
1635,goranm-39184,Rambo misses his mark... again,1,11 October 2019,"Like 2008 film, The Last Blood terrible movie by nearly all accounts. It is gratuitously violent, rascist (if you are Mexican, it's must you have to be offended because this is that type of film), short and above all, kick in the nuts for ol' fans like me. Not a single glimpse of older movies (the first three to be precise) is evoked here. Like it's stand-alone film with a geriatric post-Vietnam vet. No helicopters, no booby traps, no jungle/forest... like filmmakers intentionally decided to rid themselves of any connection from previous movies. On top of that, the narrative is predictable, stereotypical with rushed finale, filled with plot flaws and generic lousy acting.Screw this.",Rambo - Last Blood
1636,hossamvirgo,A different take on Rambo....,7,20 September 2019,"I recently watched Rambo: last blood and I must say I enjoyed it for what it is, a mindless ultra violent action movie . I am surprised that critics are strongly criticizing the movie ...Stallone is currently 73 years and still going strong in this late career phase...how can we expect him to engage in a large scale adventure movie!!...this is a suitable scenario for an aging veteran a actor....few actors were capable of enduring in the movie business for so many years like sly....we should accept the fact that this is a late career effort....but nonetheless, the nostalgic factor will undoubtedly help this movie gain a worlwide appeal....I just wish that sly seek to rely on better scenarios in the future and less on the gore....to sum it up....Stallone is a living legend...let us enjoy the iconic actor in his last Rambo installement...and not excepect anything more than a enjoyable revenge flick by a man who is fighting to endure in the business.....",Rambo - Last Blood
1637,gabrielshimaoka,Awesome!! Sly is a true legend,10,24 September 2019,Rambo reminds us the true meaning of Justice and Family.,Rambo - Last Blood
