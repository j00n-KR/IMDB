0,TheLittleSongbird,Deliverance of evil,5,29 December 2018,"Having been on a roll watching and reviewing gradually over time films belonging in horror film franchises, the Chucky/'Child's Play' films were the most recent to get this treatment. Part of my want to see them was my fascination to see if killer doll Chucky deserved his horror icon status. My conclusion seeing the films is that he does deserve it and a hugely entertaining and creepy character, that is quite a bit better than the films.The Chucky/'Child's Play' films are a mixed bag. The best of the series is still the first film followed quite closely by 'Bride of Chucky', enjoyed both immensely while acknowledging their imperfections. Did sort of like the second too while being mixed to indifferent on the third (which gets a lot of dislike but for me it wasn't that bad). 'Seed of Chucky' is a step or two down from 'Bride of Chucky' and my feelings are the same as those for 'Child's Play 3', thinking it was not that bad but didn't do an awful lot for me at the end of the day. Whether it's the worst of the series is debatable, have heard from friends that the films that followed are worse, having said that it is not hard to see why it is one of the lower rated films of the series here and why many dislike it. This is disappointing as this did have potential to be one of the best Chucky/'Child's Play' films if it was as good as 'Bride of Chucky', considering that Chucky and Tiffany return and there is again emphasis on comedy.Lets start with the good things. 'Seed of Chucky' looks great. It is filmed with a lot of atmosphere, has a suitably eerie look and the special effects are nothing short of terrific. The music score is one of the best of the series, its hauntingly ominous sounds not easy to forget in the long run. Tiffany steals the show here pretty much, being both amusing and creepy, and Jennifer Tilly does have a ball playing her, wisely not taking it too seriously. Brad Dourif is still deliciously malevolent as Chucky, though he should have had more to do.While not near as fresh or witty as the humour in 'Bride of Chucky', there are some darkly funny parts and lines. The parodies and in-jokes need familiarity in order to get them, being familiar with a vast majority of them this was not a problem for me, but some do work. The memorable being a quite hilarious cameo from John Waters. Another scene stealer was Glen/Glenda, hilariously played by Billy Boyd.'Seed of Chucky' however has a number of serious problems. The story is both daft and lacking oomph, also suffering from trying to cram in too much and struggling to balance it all and properly exploring it. Meaning it all feels muddled and over-stuffed with the Glen/Glenda being particularly over-complicated. With the funny moments, there are moments but it's not consistent. Other parts feel very limp and stale.Found that the supporting cast on the most part were very bland, with one of the biggest faults of the film being the utterly wretched performance from Redman, out of place and annoying. 'Seed of Chucky' is severely lacking in the horror elements, where there is pretty much no atmosphere or mood. It is more reliant on gore rather than suspense or creepiness, and it is a big problem as it is overused to the point of abuse and too much of it is rather gratuitously tasteless. The kills are neither creative, palm-sweating or nail-biting, instead being predictable, sometimes silly and the overuse and gratuity of the gore hampers them. Don Mancini's directorial ineperience is all over.Altogether, a lot of serious faults here but there are things that prevent it from being a complete waste of time. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Seed of Chucky
1,Leofwine_draca,The worst 'Chucky' thus far,3,11 December 2016,"Well I've seen plenty of bad movies in my time, but this HAS to be one of the worst. While the previous film BRIDE OF CHCUKY was a ho-hum entry in the long-running CHILD'S PLAY series, SEED OF CHCUKY decides to do away with the horror entirely, becoming a self-referential post-modern spoof of the series itself – or maybe it's just rubbish. It comes across as a silly, plot less piece of drivel, with lots of different sub-plots, none of which make much sense. Don Marcini, who wrote the previous four films in the series, decided to have a go directing and he makes a right pig's ear of it. This is never anything but cheesy, stupid rubbish, the stuff a five-year-old could do better.Saying that, it's surprising the amount of talent they've got in front of the cameras. Brad Dourif once again found himself unable to say no, so he supplies Chucky's foul-mouthed voice. Jennifer Tilly returns from the last film, and she's by far the best thing in this one: sexy, funny, and more than willing to laugh at herself. Tilly earns the rating a whole extra star, she's that good. The new addition to the cast is Billy Boyd, playing Chucky's offspring as a gender-confused youngster. I'm not sure what the heck Boyd's doing here, other than having a laugh, but I did kind of like him in this. There are lots of odd cameos as well, including Jason Flemyng playing Santa in the opening sequence. The oddest of them all is shock director John Waters, playing a sleazy photographer who meets his end in his own dark room in the film's gruesome highlight.I won't even go into the stupid body-swapping storyline, involving people possessed by dolls, dolls possessed by people, artificial insemination (by doll), and family relationships. The jokes are resolutely bad, and even the dozens of references they throw in – from ED WOOD to THE SHINING and everything in between – can't sweeten the experience. There is some gore, but it looks cheap and rubbery for the most part, thrown in because it has to be rather than fitting into the story. Even if you're a fan of this particular franchise – although I can't see why you would be – I'd recommend giving this monstrosity a miss!",Seed of Chucky
2,SnoopyStyle,Crazy,5,2 November 2017,"The child of Chucky and Tiffany has been used to perform for ventriloquist Shitface as Psychs in England. It is haunted by murders and has become a pacifist. It escapes from Shitface and heads to Hollywood to find its parents. Chucky and Tiffany are being used as props for a movie with Jennifer Tilly. She is desperate to be in Redman's next movie and is willing to do anything. Chucky and Tiffany is reanimated and reunited with their child Glen/Glenda. To Glen/Glenda's horrors, they have a disturbing plan to procreate. Joan (Hannah Spearritt) is Tilly's assistant. Pete Peters (John Waters) is a spying paparazzi.There are some hilarious stuff going on but there are also some very twisted disturbing stuff too. I do love the comedy but the disturbing story is very uncomfortable. It's not horrifying as much as awkward. First off, Glen/Glenda is creepy as hell. Chucky has a cuteness to his design but that's not close for the androgynous Glen/Glenda. Pulling down the pants is hilarious but the face is disturbing. I get the sense that this franchise is going experimental to see who is willing to follow it. I'm maybe half in. I can't condone where this is going. The franchise is going off in weird directions that may be story dead ends.",Seed of Chucky
3,claudio_carvalho,Funny Black Humor Comedy,6,24 September 2005,"Shitface, the son of Chucky and Tiffany, travels from England to Hollywood to meet his parents he had seen on TV. He accidentally resurrects them, and they try to transfer their souls to the body of Jennifer Tilly and Redman.""Seed of Chucky"" is a funny and very gore black humor comedy. There are many bloody jokes, and the movie presents a witty Jennifer Tilly, mocking with her weight, her shape, her voice and her behavior. I found this actress very brave in performing such a outrageous role, and I liked her a lot. John Waters is also hilarious in the role of a snoopy paparazzi. The music score is also great. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Filho de Chucky"" (""The Son of Chucky"")",Seed of Chucky
4,gavin6942,"Not Surprisingly, the Death of the Series",4,16 December 2008,"Chucky and Tiffany return to continue their killing spree. But now, they have a child... is it Glen or Glenda (nod to Ed Wood)? And Jennifer Tilly arrives, not only playing the voice of Tiffany but herself. Beyond that, it's more of the same you've come to expect.Writer-director Don Mancini, who has been the mastermind of the entire series, puts the nails as firmly in the coffin as possible with this one. It's one thing for a horror series to get increasingly humorous. It happens. And sometimes it's done right (both ""Jason X"" and ""Jason Lives"" were decent comedic additions to the ""Friday the 13th"" series). Sometimes it's not (every ""Leprechaun"" sequel). This one was not.A few parts were clever. I really enjoyed the homage to ""The Shining"", for example. And the excessive blood and gore are always welcome. But the humor was by and large lame, and the horror aspects were so toned down as to be largely or maybe completely non-existent. Someone getting disemboweled could be disgusting or terrifying... but here it wasn't. And why do all horror films today have rappers aspiring to be actors? I don't regret picking up this film, since I got it from a rummage sale for fifty cents. But seriously, it's a load of rubbish. The plot doesn't even make a whole lot of sense (the ""soul transfer"" thing is confusing) and it's unclear why it climaxes in the way it does... you'll have to see it to understand what I mean, but I don't even recommend you do that. Stick to the first three ""Child's Play"" films, please.",Seed of Chucky
5,jboothmillard,Seed of Chucky,5,28 November 2005,"The first film in the Child's Play series was alright, the second film was okay, the third film was pretty rubbish, and the fourth film Bride of Chucky was fun to watch, and this was the fifth film, directed by the creator of the killer doll himself, Dom Mancini. Basically the story continues six years after the previous film, following the birth of the offspring of Chucky (Brad Dourif) and Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), their orphan child son, named Shitface (The Lord of the Rings' Billy Boyd) by the guy who found him, is desperate to know who his real parents are, and he sees them on television. Chucky and Tiffany dummies have been created by Hollywood for a new movie being made about their exploits, with actress Jennifer Tilly as the star, so the young doll travels there and uses the voodoo amulet, from when he was found, to bring them back to life. Chucky is shocked to have a child, but Tiffany embraces it, but they argue as to whether their child is a boy or a girl, as he has no genitals, Chucky for being a boy renames him ""Glen"", but Tiffany arguing he is a girl calls him ""Glenda"", Glen also finds out about their violent murders, the parents agree not to kill, both will not keep this promise. Jennifer Tilly wanting to diversify into more dramatic roles hears that rapper Redman is making his directorial debut with a film about the Virgin Mary, so she auditions for him, but to try and secure the role she starts seducing him, Chucky and Tiffany plan to transfer their soles into their bodies, Jennifer is Tiffany's favourite actress. As part of the plan, Chucky masturbates into a cup and Tiffany inseminates Jennifer with Chucky's semen, Chucky also kills photographer Pete Peters (John Waters) who is sniffing around Jennifer's house wanting a juicy story, the next morning Jennifer finds that she is pregnant, but Tiffany in a moment of fury kills Redman, the voodoo magic of the dolls means that the pregnancy will accelerate. Jennifer's publicist Joan (Hannah Spearritt) is burned alive by Tiffany trying to help her, and Jennifer's chauffeur Stan (Steve Lawton), who also is in love with Jennifer, becomes the replacement body for Chucky to transfer his soul, while this is going Glen is having identity issues, the killing is causing him to turn into other personality ""Glenda"". Jennifer gives to birth to twins, a boy and a girl, but the situation gets heated, Chucky shuts everyone up and decides he is more suited to being a killer doll, he tries to kill Jennifer, but throwing a knife instead kills Stan who shields her, and police arriving stop any transferring of souls. Jennifer recovers in hospital, there Tiffany arrives and and starts the voodoo ritual to transfer her soul into the actress's body, Chucky arrives and kills Tiffany with an axe, Glen watches and in the moment snaps and grabs to attack Chucky, dismembering him and then decapitating him, Glen realising what he has done has a breakdown, Jennifer comforts him. Five years later, the twins named Glen and Glenda are celebrating their birthday, it is revealed Tiffany was successful transferring her soul into Jennifer's body, and doll Glen also transfered his soul into that of her son, one of the wrapped birthday presents contains Chucky's right arm. Also starring Keith-Lee Castle as Psychs, makeup and special effects designer Tony Gardner, Jason Flemyng as Santa. Tilly does well sending herself up, self-mocking her ditsy persona and flashing her cleavage, and also being the female killer doll, and Dourif as always is good value as the infamous male killer doll with the one-liners, the film has a few good laughs as it spoofs many familiar scary movies and modern celebrity culture, the tongue and cheek humour is perhaps not as up there as the previous entry, but it is a funny enough horror comedy. Worth watching!",Seed of Chucky
6,BA_Harrison,Just when you thought it couldn't get any dafter...,8,22 November 2009,"If you thought Bride of Chucky was supremely silly stuff, wait until you get a load of Seed of Chucky, which takes the Child's Play series into seriously deranged territory by pitting the real-life Jennifer Tilly (played by Jennifer Tilly, of course, who has a blast sending herself up) against her killer doll counterpart, Tiffany, and of course, dear old Chucky (once again voiced by Brad Dourif).The film also introduces us to chronic pant-wetter Shitface (voiced by Billy Boyd), Chucky and Tiffany's ugly offspring, who has spent six years in England working as a ventriloquist's doll (meaning that he now has a Cockney accent!). Whilst watching a TV report on a new movie about the Chucky legend, the timid chap mistakes the animatronic dolls being used in the film for his long-lost mum and dad, and heads for Hollywood for a family reunion.At the studio where the film is being made, Shitface discovers his inanimate 'parents' in the prop department, and uses family heirloom, the Heart of Damballa (the voodoo amulet that has the power to transfer a person's soul into another body) to once again bring Tiffany and Chucky to life.Opening with a brilliant Chucky-vision POV shot that stalks several victims through a house, writer/director Don Mancini immediately shows that he is capable of some pretty impressive visuals, and also proves his popcorn horror credentials by throwing in a gratuitous shower scene and some splattery gore. Mancini also displays a wonderfully perverse imagination, his tongue in cheek script bristling with wickedly camp humour and thoroughly demented action.The lunacy includes Tiffany and Chucky renaming their anatomically incorrect, gender confused son 'Glen or Glenda' (in a reference to the infamous Ed Wood 'documentary'), Jennifer Tilly kissing the severed head of a murder victim (believing it to be a latex prop), Chucky whacking himself off in order to impregnate Tilly with a turkey baster (Tiffany flashes her plastic tits to get him excited!), numerous references to Tilly's role in Bound and jokes about her subsequent weight gain, a cheesy Britney Spears gag, and Chucky mimicking Jack Nicholson's axe scene in the Shining (but amusingly finding himself lost for words, rather than uttering the expected line of dialogue, 'Heeeere's Chucky!).Also joining in the fun are rapper Redman, as a movie director considering Tilly for the part of The Virgin Mary (she offers to sleep with him in order to secure the part!!!), Primeval star Hannah Spearitt as Tilly's assistant (she gets set on fire by Chucky, who must still remember her earlier pop career in S-Club 7), and trash director John Waters, for whom performing such camp material is second nature.With a Child's Play remake in the works, it looks as though the current series of films might have come to the end; but should there ever be another chapter featuring Tilly and Co., I really hope that it continues in this very silly vein—the fun is infectious.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Seed of Chucky
7,moonspinner55,Is it depraved and twisted? Yes...but is it entertaining even on that level? No...,1,24 August 2005,"I honestly felt the Chucky movie-franchise died out after ""Child's Play"" installment no. #2, which boasted an imaginative, elaborate finale but suffered from enervated sequel-itis, complete with a shabby, boring script. Yet the curtain failed to come down on the killer-possessed doll, and so--years after his exploits have ceased to be scary or even maliciously amusing--we have ""Seed of Chucky"". How is one able to seriously critique such a product, rife as it is with the kind of sniggering stupidity we all left behind in junior high? Bloodthirsty dolls Chucky and Tiffany meet their offspring, a freakish, sexless goon, and each take turns making life hell for actress Jennifer Tilly (sending up herself, but not looking very happy about it). The puns and wisecracks are kept to a minimum, but there's still lots of blood, a disembowelment (the movie's low-point), a decapitation, and two bodies hurtling over second-story balconies. What ""plot"" there is early on quickly goes down in flames as the filmmakers resort to far-fetched idiocy (such as two dolls dragging heavy human bodies around--and hiding corpses in closets). What we don't get to witness is ridiculous enough, but what is actually on the screen is really beneath contempt. * from ****",Seed of Chucky
8,paul_haakonsen,A step back for the franchise...,5,22 December 2015,"""Seed of Chucky"" isn't the strongest of the movies in the ""Child's Play"" franchise. Why? Well, because they tried a bit too hard to incorporate way too much comedy. Don't get me wrong here, it is still an adequate movie, and the other ""Child's Play"" movies also do have elements of humor in them, but it was just a bit too much in ""Seed of Chucky"".As for the story in ""Seed of Chucky"", well I will say that it overall felt like the soup was a bit too thin, and they should have stopped the franchise a while back.The acting in the movie was good, though, as it has been in the many previous ""Child's Play"" movies too. But there is no doubt about the fact that it was Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly who carried the movie all the way.Director Don Mancini had cut down on killings in ""Seed of Chucky"" compared to the previous movies, and instead putting most of the focus on the dysfunctional relationship between Chucky, Tiffany and their odd son Glenn.While it is still an entertaining movie, it was just lacking the elements of the early years in the franchise, and you can say that ""Seed of Chucky"" sort of is a light variant of the ""Child's Play"" movies. As such, I am rating it a mediocre five out of ten stars.",Seed of Chucky
9,Coventry,"Makes ""Bride of Chucky"" looks like ""Citizen Kane""",2,23 May 2005,"I can hardly believe that it was Don Mancini (writer of the original 1988 Child's Play) himself who came up with this stupid and entirely redundant fourth sequel. The only reasonable excuse he has for doing this is that he got so tired of his own ""creation"" that he decided to ruin it single-handedly Not likely, though. ""Seed of Chucky"" is a comedy/parody like we've seen them too much already. Set in Hollywood, with actors and actresses both playing themselves and their movie characters in a setting that blends the fiction with the so-called real lives of these persons. Yawn! You know how that goes: it gives mediocre actresses like Jennifer Tilly the opportunity to criticize other Hollywood bimbos and their own disappointing careers. Tiffany and Chucky come back to life on the film-set of their own wicked adventures and they're accompanied now by their son/daughter who speaks with the irritant voice of Billy Boyd (Lord of the Rings dork number 4). This movie actually handles about nothing and Mancini wastes the entire duration with lame Hollywood sarcasm and lousy caricatures. Chucky (if I'm not mistaken, the star of the franchise) has got nothing to do and the few bloody massacres he commits are only put in to make us remember that he was once a horror icon. The 1998 film ""Bride of Chucky"" was pretty stupid already, but at least it didn't treat its viewers like total morons. The gags, the acting, the pacing, the goreeverything was better in that film and that really says a lot. The only mildly entertaining parts in ""Seed of Chucky"" are the sequences with John Waters (trash-director of ""Pink Flamingoes"") as the repulsive paparazzi and a modest cameo of Jason Flemyng as Santa Clause. I sincerely hope this was the last attempt to bring the murderous doll back to the big screen. Brad Dourif deserves to do much better projects and so do we! Avoid at all costs.",Seed of Chucky
10,hitchcockthelegend,Chucky has gone to seed.,3,27 October 2014,"It would be pure folly to have expected Seed of Chucky to be a brilliant entry in the Chucky franchise, the big-wigs pulling the financial strings behind the scenes clearly had no idea what had made the series popular in horror circles in the first place.Bride of Chucky (part 4 for anyone counting) was bold and it worked, it managed to be that rare old thing of a horror film able to marry up horror and comedy for good entertainment purpose. Unfortunately everything about Seed of Chucky is lazy and weak. There is no story of substance here, it is neither funny or scary, the parody and self awareness the makers go for runs out of steam after 15 minutes! When the writers are reduced to a masturbation sequence to get their meta kicks then you know there's problems. 3/10, and that is purely for Jennifer Tilly and her delightful way of not taking herself seriously.",Seed of Chucky
11,Hey_Sweden,Jennifer Tilly is the best thing about it.,6,1 October 2017,"In this fifth entry of this ongoing series, the creator, Don Mancini, directs for the first time. His story picks up a few years after ""Bride of..."", and Chucky's and Tiffany's offspring is working as a ventriloquist dummy. He tracks his parents down to Hollywood, where filmmakers are busy making a fictional ""Chucky"" movie. Once the family is reunited, Tiffany figures on giving up the act of killing for the sake of setting a good example. Of course, Chucky will have NONE of that, and she can't exactly quit murdering people cold turkey, either. Meanwhile, actress Jennifer Tilly is so desperate to escape her typecasting as bimbos, that she'll get it on with hip hop artist / debuting filmmaker Redman (playing himself) in order to secure a role as the Virgin Mary.At this point, this series had become much more dark comedy than true horror, and as such, it's not always terribly funny. In fact, it is tiresome at times. Mancini goes quite heavy on the self- awareness, albeit more through plot and situation than through dialogue. He does give Tilly a chance to portray herself in an over the top manner. It is great that the veteran actress, known for many sexpot roles, is so willing and able to poke fun at herself. She gives ""Seed of Chucky"" its principal value, although the in-joke regarding the gender-confused childs' name is pretty clever.The first entry in this franchise to feature nudity, this also doesn't skimp on the gore, so it may appeal to some viewers who aren't particularly demanding; it does have a decent body count, and a little variation in how characters die. It is kind of mean spirited, so people may appreciate that aspect.There's also some fun in seeing filmmaker John Waters in a supporting role, as a stereotypically sleazy tabloid journalist. ""God bless the little people,"" he quips. Brad Dourif once again rips into the scenery, voicing the psychotic, bloodthirsty toy that he's performed since 1988. Makeup effects veteran Tony Gardner plays himself. Billy Boyd, who'd made his name as a cast member in the ""Lord of the Rings"" features, is amusing and rather endearing in the role of the conflicted doll offspring.Chucky does have one great moment late in the picture where he actually stops to assess his situation, and ponders the futility of it all. This viewer had to give ""Seed of..."" some credit for that moment.After a break of almost a decade, Mancini brought the series back to its serious roots for ""Curse of..."" in 2013.Six out of 10.",Seed of Chucky
12,preppy-3,I wanted to like this...but couldn't,4,26 November 2004,"The son (voice of Billy Boyd) of Chucky (voice of Brad Dourif) and Tiffany (voice of Jennifer Tilly) is (somehow) playing a dummy in England. He's miserable, is an orphan and wants to know who his parents are. He sees Chuck and Tiffany on TV, realizes they're his parents and runs to America to be with them. There he revives their evil spirits and the three decide to become a real family...and go after the actress Jennifer Tilly and others to take over their bodies and become human again....Sounds good but this fails on almost every level. It isn't even remotely scary (even the gore was dull) or very funny. Director and writer Don Mancini wrote all the other ""Child's Play"" movies--his last (""Bride of Chucky"") was GREAT but he drops the ball on this one. It's also his directorial debut--it shows. The guy seems unsure of how to stage even the most simple scenes. The plot has its moments, but it meanders all over the place...halfway through I was totally lost! And something is seriously wrong when you have John Waters do a cameo and even HE isn't funny! I was bored most of the time and there are at least FOUR climaxes---all bad.There are a FEW saving graces. The special effects that have the dolls moving and talking are incredible; Billy Boyd is actually hilarious with just his voice; Tilly (wisely) doesn't take her role too seriously; Dourif is great (as always) playing Chucky; there are a few very funny in jokes for horror film fans and Steve Lawton is really hot in his small role. Also the film is refreshingly pro-gay.But that's not enough to recommend it. It fails as a horror film and a comedy. I give it a 4.",Seed of Chucky
13,poolandrews,Inventive & often rather bizarre fifth entry in the Child's Play series.,6,23 August 2007,"Seed of Chucky starts in England where a guy named Psychs (Keith-Lee Castle) is using a living talking doll in his ventriloquist act, he found this doll in a cemetery in America & it's alive. The doll wonders where he came from & who it's parents are & when he sees an on set report from the new Hollywood horror film based on the Chucky & Tiffany killer doll urban legend he is convinced they are his parents so he escapes Psychs & mails himself over there. Once there he finds his parents Chucky (Brad Dourif) & Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) although they are just animatronic puppets for the film, using the magic amulet he manages to bring them back to life & they waste no time in searching out new bodies & trying to continue the family line...This Romanian American co-production was written & directed by Don Mancini who wrote the previous four Child's Play films & makes his directorial debut here with Seed of Chucky. The original Child's Play (1988) was a tight slasher film that went for scares as were the next two installments Child's Play 2 (1990) & Child's Play 3 (1991) then came Bride of Chucky (1998) where director Ronny Yu reinvented the series & turned it into a black comedy while still retaining some over-the-top gore set-pieces after which we ended up with this Seed of Chucky which goes for out & out bad taste comedy & is a long way from the original. Seed of Chucky is such an outrageous film it's hard to believe, from Tiffany trying to artificially inseminate someone with a turkey baster to Chucky masturbating to their child having an identity crisis to Tiffany phoning a quit helpline to try & give up her addiction to killing this one feels like a sit com with Chucky & Tiffany as the main character's as opposed to a straight horror flick, on the one hand this approach is different & provides some fun I would have preferred a bit more horror. Having just watched it I'm not quite sure what to make of it, Seed of Chucky is just so far removed from Chucky simply killing people & coming out with a one liner I'm wondering if it's gone too far towards the comedy side of things & has abandoned it's roots.Director Mancini does alright, there are countless film references & homages here for you to spot from the obvious like Edward D. Wood Jr.'s Glen or Glenda & The Shining (1980) as Chucky puts his face through a large hole in a wooden door he has just made with an axe to the more obscure. Setting the film around the making of an actual Child's Play film in Hollywood is as self referential as it gets I suppose. There's some good gore here, someone has their throat slashed, someone has their face burned off with acid, someone is decapitated, someone is gutted & someone is burned to death. The special effects are pretty good although the opening CGI sequence of the sperm fertilising the egg looks terrible.With a modest budget of about $12,000,000 Seed of Chucky isn't anything special to look at, it's well made but it isn't scary & comes across more like an outrageous black comedy. It was shot largely in Romania. The acting is OK but the human cast are bit players & it's the puppet family who take center stage.Seed of Chucky mixes bad taste comedy & over-the-top gore so it's definitely an acquired taste, I liked it for what it was but couldn't help feel a bit of disappointment at where the series has gone.",Seed of Chucky
14,utgard14,Chucky Should've Worn a Rubber,4,27 October 2013,"Jennifer Tilly is amusing and not bad to look at. Chucky is almost a non-entity in his own movie. John Waters' role is worth a chuckle or two. Redman is a waste of space and the scene where the camera focuses on him while he chews with his mouth open made me want to vomit. However, the worst part of the movie is the title character, Chucky & Tiffany's disgustingly weird offspring Glen...or is it Glenda? Already we're starting off with an Ed Wood reference so you know this is going to be terrible. I'm not sure what they were going for with this thing. Glen/da is creepy in ways I don't believe they intended. Failed attempt at a horror comedy is 99% (bad) comedy and 1% horror. This is one of those movies that has very little going for it, but because it's hated contrarian phonies will say how underrated and under-appreciated it is and try to make it a cult classic in the decades to come.",Seed of Chucky
15,lastliberal,"I am Chucky, the killer doll! And I dig it!",5,10 November 2007,"OK, I have succeeded in watching all the Chucky movies. Is that a big accomplishment? Well, this one was really funny. It is a real laugh-fest, not a horror movie.Jennifer Tilly is in it throughout and that alone makes it worth the time. She has to be the best screamer in Hollywood, and not too bad to look at either.I thought it was brilliant casting John Waters as the paparazzi. The acid was a nice touch.I doubt if many would know the Glen/Glenda reference from Ed Wood.A laugh riot!",Seed of Chucky
16,Boba_Fett1138,Some good entertainment!,6,14 November 2011,"It spells trouble when a writer of a series steps in to take over the director's seat. Don Mancini did just this but I must say, things could had turned out way worse. It's not a that well liked movie but it actually is quite fun to watch. Nothing great, just simply some good entertainment.And that's why most people probably hate this movie. Way back, the series started out as a horror-series and Chucky was still a maniacal little killer doll. As the series progressed, it became more and more entertainment orientated and started to be less about its horror. Out of all the Child Play movies, this one is probably the least horror filled but this got replaced by some, in my opinion, good comedy.I was actually never opposed to it that the series was heading in a more comical direction. Its main premise had always been a quite silly one to begin with, so why not make some fun with it. This movie does just that, which makes it a bit of a shame that it also feels the need to poke fun at lots of other stuff at well and turn into a bit of a parody at times. The movie really didn't needed this and it besides makes the movie a bit lame and simplistic at times. It's too often taking the far too obvious road with its comedy.You might also complain that the movie doesn't haven enough Chucky in it. This was already sort of a problem with the previous movie; ""Bride of Chucky"". But I feel this got compensated with a lot of other great characters. Jennifer Tilly returns again as the voice of Tiffany doll but she's also playing herself this time, which is pretty fun. You could really say that she is the true star of the movie this time and she isn't afraid to make fun of herself or her own career. But it's not like she had much choice though. It almost seems as if she was the one that was pushing the writers to come up with another Child's Play movie, in which she would be the main star. But like I said, I don't mind. She is probably the best thing about this movie!But an addition that does work out rather disappointing is the Glen or Glenda doll, voiced by Billy Boyd. It's the kid of Tiffany and Chucky, who got born at the end of the last movie. It just doesn't add all that much I feel and it only provides the movie with some needless side-plots. Besides, the character itself can get quite annoying at times and really doesn't have a very good look.The Chucky and Tiffany doll on the other hand look better than ever. It's the 21th century, so the dolls all got a modern update. Their faces and expressions all look better than ever and it also seemed like more was possible to them with them this time.And even though this really isn't a horror, that doesn't mean that Chucky and Tiffany aren't slashing away. There are plenty of killings in this one and even more blood. They really go over-the-top with it at times, which in return only adds more to the movie its comical aspects.It's not a great movie, it's far too simplistic for that but it at least was a movie I really had some fun with!6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Seed of Chucky
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,It's not as much the fact that the joke is repeated until we're more than just sick and tired of it as much as the fact that it was never funny in the first place,1,22 March 2005,"Here it is. The (dear sweet god I certainly hope so) last Chucky film. The last of the films, and the first that I've truly disliked. Wait, disliked? Scratch that, flat-out hated every second of. The film is a comedy more than anything else, and instead of coming up with many good jokes, as every competent comedy writer would, Don Mancini takes the easy way out and jumps on the bandwagon with what Hollywood says is funny right now and writes just a few poor jokes and repeats them over and over... and over. The kid thinking he's Japanese and being gender-confused, Chucky killing, Tiffany trying not to kill... etc. When exactly did Tiffany turn sappy, by the way? In the previous one, she actually yelled at a Goth guy for not having killed anyone. This time, she acts like Chucky was why she killed. Everything about this film is just so poorly done. We've got a kid doll that won't stop wetting himself; a rapper/black guy stereotype; crude sex gags and jokes forced so far down our throat that they're enough to make even the most tolerant person gag and a film that is basically making fun of all the earlier installments... and I, for one, am not laughing. The plot is ridiculous. The pacing is even worse than the previous two... it's freaking intolerable. The acting is incredibly poor. The characters are very poorly written and all clichéd and stereotypical. About half of them are actually just there to act as victims or running gags... or both. The dialog is immensely poorly written. The humor is awful... the comical timing is constantly off, and the punchlines are forced. Honestly, there's just nothing in the film to make it worth watching, apart from possibly the biggest of Child's Play/Chucky fans. I recommend this only to the very biggest Chucky fans, and I advise anyone else, everyone else to avoid this, or at the very least, approach with caution. I doubt I'll ever watch it again, and I can think of tons of very bad movies that I've seen several times. 1/10",Seed of Chucky
18,view_and_review,Who allowed Chucky to have offspring,2,28 February 2007,"I need to slap myself. What the heck was I thinking, watching this crap. Oh yeah, now I remember... I was thinking: I remember years ago seeing a movie with a freaky little doll named Chucky with a human soul running around killing people. That movie was pretty good, that doll was psycho and I hated him, but the movie was alright. Hmmm... I haven't seen any of the other ""Child's Play"" sequels, let me check this one out.What a bomb.First, there is a pathetic pants wetter that's supposed to be the son of Chucky. Weak. Chucky was a nutso killer with a rap song about him, how did he have such a lame son. And how do dolls reproduce anyway? Did I miss something? Second, Chucky and his wife are brought back to life. Do any evil creatures just stay dead? Third: how ridiculous was it to have Jennifer Tilly play herself and be the voice of Chucky's bride.Finally: What the heck was Redman doing in the movie? This movie was far from the Chucky I remember. Chucky was one of those slasher villains that I had a healthy hatred and respect for; up there with Michael Myers, Jason, and Freddy Kruger. After this movie, Chucky is just a joke, forever barred from the slasher hall of fame. He no longer even deserves an honorable mention when discussing the best and most feared horror film haunters.",Seed of Chucky

This time the plot centers around the offspring of Chucky and Tiffany who is named Glen who is peaceful. When he locates his parents he discovers their plans to kidnap actress Jennifer Tilly along with rapper director Redman in order to become human. Tiffany struggles in changing her ways for motherhood but Chucky prefers his murderous nature and even runs pop star Britney Spears off the road. Effective setup with detailed structure despite its preference for gore. Well directed by Don Mancini with a production that caters to the earlier films. Hilarious performance by Tilly playing herself and mocking her own career by allowing herself to give birth to killer dolls. Redman is amusing as a director whom Tilly attempts to seduce into casting her over Julia Roberts but he ends up being part of Chucky and Tiffany's screwed up ritual to become human. Hannah Spearritt plays Tilly's abused handler who is set in flames before her character really comes to life. John Waters steals scenes as a paparazzi who catches a glimpse of Chucky and suffers consequences. Chucky himself is voiced by Brad Dourif. Disgusting and pointless improvement at best.

20,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Funny, entertaining enter in the series",9,23 October 2015,"Realizing the truth about his family heritage, a living doll reunites the pair of dolls like him only to find their murderous tendencies are still influencing their behavior and tries to keep them in line while finally trying to rid their doll-like state.This is one of the better films in the series and really comes off nicely. The storyline here is one of its most appealing parts, which is pretty clever and new. It isn't a typical outline for a film's fourth sequel, and it serves as a double blessing by not following the norm and giving us a traditional film, and also by the different elements that can be added to the plot. Several of the story lines are quite good, as the main one here of wanting-to-get-off-murdering-others for their child's sake is nicely handled, and the weaning for killing delivers some of the movie's best scenes. The comedy is another really enjoyable aspect that has been added to it. This is probably the most out-right comedic movie of the series, and is pretty hilarious in most aspects of the film. The early bickering done between Chucky and Tiffany about family life is some truly great lines, and a later exchange gives some real gut-busters. Even other instances are pretty funny as it has its fair share of gags that are both really funny and pretty creative, from the situations presented here coming from living murderous dolls trying to teach their gender-confused son about their lifestyle and how to come to terms with one's self in life, the outrageous situations that pop up here requiring one-off murders of the photographer, the stage-hand and the publicist in particular graphic means and how they've finally come to terms with their condition as a whole that are not only truly funny in themselves because it's about killer dolls but also because there's a lot of funny material springing from these scenes. The only time we get suspense in the film is an impressive opening, and it is some really juicy stuff. The stalking and the extremely odd camera angles add to its effectiveness, and the pay-off to each of the sequences are nicely timed to get a great jump, while the final redemption battle in the hospital gets some nice fun in as well as delivering some solid gore which are provided elsewhere through this with some fine, brutal kills delivered here. These are good enough to hold this off from its one really defining flaw. By veering far off into the comedy angle, this has left the horror category completely. There is nothing here that would produce any sort of thrills beyond the opening scene, but after that there's nothing. The suspense is also gone, leaving us with no real chances to become scared at what is going on, as even though we really weren't supposed to, as it's still trying to be a horror film an attempt could've been made here with several of these scenes potentially being quite thrilling. The only other flaw is that the film is also tremendously cheesy, being packed to the brim with sleazy goodness from the characters to the actions and even set-ups reek of cheese, and that may be something which won't sit all that well with fans of the more serious original. Still, there's a lot more to like here that does help this one more than hurting it.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief doll and female Nudity and brief doll masturbation.",Seed of Chucky

Once there he reads from the magical necklace and resurrects the two dolls. When finds out his parents are murderers he pees himself (a recurring gag) See he's pretty much a pussy who doesn't know if he's a boy or girl. So Chucky calls him Glen and Tiff calls him Glenda. (laughing yet) While the first three Chucky films were played straight, and ""Bride of Chucky"" seemed to be a horror comedy. This one is Comedy, with some horror. I found myself amused to a point. Din't really care for the son character. But that's just my opinion.

22,StevePulaski,A Seed That Wasn't Planted As Well...,6,15 July 2010,"Here it is, the finale of the Chucky series and the last one before the remake. We ended off on a decent note, but a sour note for the entire series. This franchise was so close to being perfect, but not after CP3 came along. The franchise's hopes of being perfect were dead and never again to be revived. This one, I like to consider a straight Comedy. Some sequences are Horror, but nothing is scary and it feels like it was just made to be Comedy. By the the third film, it was almost foreshadowed and engraved in walls that this film would take on a comical approach, which is too bad. This film most likely could have held up to an entirely creepy franchise. Though people like to say (and by people I mean someone on this website) if it has a Horror feel, its Horror, or if there's killing, blood, and a slasher, its Horror. Its not Horror when there are no jump scenes, no scares, and apparently, no overall creepy setting.This time the movie opens on Glen, who is now being abused as a ventriloquist dummy for a show. After seeing footage of Chucky and Tiffany, Glen assures himself that those are his parents and makes a quest to track them down. In addition to finding Chucky and Tiffany, they are skeptical if Glen is a boy or a girl. Throughout the film he/she is referred to as Glen or Glenda (an obvious parody of the film). With appearances by Jennifer Tilly and Redman, the film is still just a below average, forgettable Comedy, borderline Horror film.What bothers me is it's need to find big name actors to make the film better. I find it really unnecessary that Redman, Martha Stewart, and John Waters are in this movie. There's no point. The first three Child's Play's used no named actors and the fourth one they introduced Jennifer Tilley who had a reputation at the time. I like Horror films that start with no names and keep no names. There's no reason that this had to take a current turn and add actors who were current. The film was made in the 80s, there's no need to add anybody new. Once again, like Bride, but used at full force here, the film has too many one liners, that can be either cut down or removed. Come to think of it, this has so many pop culture references it's a wonder it's not a parody film. The direction this film took, should have just been scrapped from the beginning. But I will at least go as far as calling it, a watchable film, that serves it's duty as a fair sequel. Nothing more.Starring: Jennifer Tilly, Billy Boyd, John Waters, Redman, and Brad Dourif.

This film took a new twist on the Chucky films, because not only does Chucky and Tiffany have a son/daughter named Glen/Glenda, but it has Jennifer Tily in it as herself who is attacked by Tiffany. The plot is a bit much to explain.I just loved how despite the fact that Tiffany, Chucky, and Glen/Glenda were dolls, they actually had real family problems like any other family would. Especially for Glen/Glenda trying to decide his sexuality. They made these things into fun jokes. I also loved how Tiffany and Chucky decide for their kid's sake to give up killing and Tiffany is taking the 12 Step program and learning it's o.k. to have ""slip up's"". When Chucky kills Britney Spears ""Oops! I did it again!"" LOL! I almost died laughing.This is my favorite Chucky movie, it was a lot of fun.

24,KineticSeoul,I got a headache trying to sit through this,2,8 June 2014,"Yeah, I wasn't expecting a suspenseful horror movie, but I also didn't expect a movie this painful to sit through. While ""Bride of Chucky"" seem to have a good balance of balls to the wall comedy and slasher elements, this one tried way too hard to be a comedy. Except it's not even funny and just comes off bland. There is only one part that somewhat stood out and that was the ""The Shining"" parody part. I started to get a headache while trying to sit through this through this junk. After ""Bride of Chucky"" I was expecting a adrenaline pumped maniac doll doing what he does best in a entertaining manner. But most of the movie revolves around perverse, crude and boring interaction between Chucky and his new family. The franchise is now at the point where it does the traditional iconic killer who is now a urban myth and people are making a movie about it with this movie. With people spoofing themselves, as a matter of fact this movie depends too much on poorly scripted parodies and spoofs. Jennifer Tilly fit in well as the sassy temptress, but in this she is a character that is really annoying to watch. It would be okay if it elevated the plot, but her character does nothing (I say character but in the movie she is suppose to be playing herself). And wanted her to just stick with the doll parts. The first person intro is the only part actually worth seeing. This is the most far-fetched and silly installment so far compared to the previous two. Again, it tried too hard to be a comedic spoof that it lost it's Chucky flare. I can understand that they couldn't stick with the same formulas for too long and the makers of this flick just wanted to make fun of itself. But this movie is just dumb in almost every way possible. It also strays super far away from the connection and rules from the previous movies and doesn't apply at all. This is a awful installment in the ""Child's play"" or ""Chucky"" franchise. I give this movie a 2.6/10 because I have seen worse.2.6/10",Seed of Chucky
25,thesar-2,"Great Title, bad execution",4,21 October 2009,"Somehow, I can't put my finger on what was wrong with 'Seed of Chucky.' Perhaps too complicated? Too many themes running around with barely an ounce of what the series was about, leading up to this? It had it very pleasant moments; not only did Jennifer Tilly return, which was a great presence for the series beginning in #4, but she also very comically played herself, always (I'm sure jokingly) mocking Julia Roberts. It also contained a lot of insider-Hollywood jokes, left-over from #4 and some very funny lines from Chucky and wife Tiffany (Tilly.) The best was, and I hesitate ruining his ""Jack Nicholson"" joke that had me rolling, near the end. In addition, were Jennifer's ""Oscar"" whine and the ""names"" given to the offspring. But it seemed flat for some reason. I've now only seen this movie twice and I've had the same empty feeling. Much like 'Superman Returns,' whenever a child's introduced to an established couple, it's time to call it quits. And so, it did. (A reboot/remake's in the works for both 'Superman' and 'Child's Play' and I think if they want to continue with both series, that's the only way to go. 'Lois & Clark,' coincidentally did the same thing: introducing a child is the kiss of series-death.) The cliffhanger for #4 was the offspring of Tiffany and Chucky and now they're making a movie-within-a-movie in #5. Tilly, taking a break from, whatever, is playing the lead while the offspring in England learns of this heads to the States to reunite with his parents. After resurrecting them (for the nth time) all hell breaks loose, as usual. I didn't hate the movie (as I did #2, and it's better than #3) but it's weak and makes me look forward to Child's Play 1.2.",Seed of Chucky
26,lost-in-limbo,There's nothing quite like murder to bring the family together.,5,11 April 2006,"Picking up a couple years after the last outing ; Chucky and Tiffany are now ordinary dolls being used in a Hollywood slasher called 'Chucky goes Psycho' inspired on the urban legends of these killer dolls. While, in Britain their innocently sweet son is part of an ventriloquist act. When not performing he spends most of the time having bad nightmares and trying to figure out who are his parents. When watching TV he comes across Chucky and Tiffany and he immediately realises they're his parents and so he heads to Hollywood to find them. Using the amulet he brings them back to life and to their surprise they discover they have a son/or maybe daughter. So the three set a plan to take over the body of a b-grade star Jennifer Tilly and director Redman, but Tiffany wants to give up on violence and hopes Glen/Glenda and Chucky will join her. Although, Chucky wants Glen/Glenda to come on a killing spree with him.Being a fan of the series I've enjoyed every single one, so I was expecting the same for this particular spin. I remember when I saw it at the cinema, I was somewhat disappointed that it went more for comedy angle and I didn't think too much of it after Ronny Yu's vastly better and refreshing twist on the franchise with 'Bride of Chucky'. It was good to see that the original creator and writer for all five films Don Mancini decided to take the director's helm, but on this occasion it just didn't work out. I just managed to catch the film on cable and I was hoping maybe since now I know it's aiming for the funny bone that'll will totally get into it. Well, it didn't entirely go to plan. Yeah, it's mildly humorous at times, but I thought it tries too hard to make you laugh with an instant gag after another and they do become rather repetitive with its heavy handed parody on the materialistic glitz and glamour of Hollywood. Yeah, we get the point, but no, they continue the self-knowing attitude and in-jokes that makes you think that maybe the whole film is a big joke. Well, the film within a film set-up gives them ammunition to mock their own franchise, references to family values to fighting temptations and there's some homage's to other horror flicks too. The cheeky script is very much tongue-in-cheek with a full blooded unpleasantness to it's humorously, stabbing irony and extremely twisted violence. The outlandish violence is simply spiteful with blood and gore running freely it's definitely one nasty habit the family share, but they do provide some innovative kills. Forget about tension and scares because it's far from frightening and this ain't your usual stalk and slash vehicle. Actually, you say it's a vehicle for Jennifer Tilly to strut around by playing (or poking fun at) herself. She gives a knockout performance by carrying the film and she raises most of the laughs. Surprisingly John Waters is quite good too as a snooping paparazzi. When ever those two were on the screen they chewed up the scenery, especially Tilly. It was the Jennifer Tilly's show, alright! She also did the voice again for the Tiffany doll and Brad Dourif returns to voice Chucky. This outing Chucky feels like a lesser figure with most of the attention on Tilly and their child Glen/Glenda who's voiced by Billy Boyd. The identity crises joke about their child was funny at first and intro is pretty hilarious, but it started to wore thin after a while when it was straining for laughs.The film is highly glossed up and it looks great with done-up treatment all round with the puppets' appearances more striking then ever. The soundtrack is rather boisterous, but fits into the overall mood of the film. I've got to hand to Mancini for the originality and for the film's unpredictable energy and surprises, but despite that there are times when spots do seem to drag (even for such a shorting running time) and the plot comes across as a bunch of muddled ideas that don't always entirely gel. The film is not great, but it's far from awful.'Seed of Chucky' seems like it wants to make joke out of everything with a lot of things totally missing the point and the film after awhile just lost its way for me. Simply, pure mockery that likes to continuously wink at you.",Seed of Chucky
27,Robert_duder,Child's Play again...decent entries keep coming!!,7,2 August 2005,"It's tough to keep a good horror series going. Let's face it as much as people make fun of a numerous entry film ie: Friday The 13th, Halloween etc. people keep coming back for more...assuming they are good. The ""Child's Play"" series as it was originally known has been doing a good job over the course of almost 20 years. They manage to keep the same style and the same character alive and well and don't lose much of the original luster which is almost an impossibility but then they've also managed to keep coming up with actual different ideas and the series has come a long way.Seed of Chucky picks up seemingly a long time after Bride of Chucky ends when Tiffany gives birth. Their ""child"" is now locked away in a cage by a mean man who is using him/her as a ""dummy"" in a ventriloquist act in England. The child is a pacifist and scared of everything and he believes that his mother and father are dead and that he is Japanese because he has a stamp on his arm that says ""Made In Japan."" Meanwhile in America, a film is being made about the world renowned killer dolls Chucky and Tiffany. Using animatronic dolls they are recreating the urban legend. During a documentary about this film, their child sees them on Television and recognizes his parents and is determined to go to them. He escapes and travels to America and finds the animatronic dolls on the set of the film. He finds them completely non-alive until he reads the inscription on the medal left to him...Chucky's infamous chant to transfer souls into bodies. Chucky and Tiffany come to life again and immediately begin their rampage of terror much to their young-lings dismay who is horrified by his parents' behavior. The Starlet of the new Chucky/Tiffany film, former Academy Award nominee Jennifer Tilly is sick and tired of getting crappy roles and is determined to nab the lead role as The Virgin Mary in a new big epic directed by Redman. Jennifer will do anything, including seduce and sleep with Redman to get her role. This gives Tiffany an idea. It's time for her and Chucky to finally get their bodies and transfer themselves into Jennifer Tilly and Redman. But they need a body for the newly named Glen/Glenda, their child. So they hatch a scheme to artificially inseminate Jennifer Tilly with Chucky's seed and get a new baby so they can transfer Glen into it. They hole themselves up in Jennifer's home and start their plan amidst paparazzi, crazy movie stars and their workers. Although Tiffany forces Chucky to stop killing for the sake of their child neither of them can stop for long. In the end it will come down to their child and whether it can be normal and stop his crazy parents or break down and give in to his natural instincts.One of the great things about the Child's Play series is that Don Mancini has been attached to every single installment since it's very beginning. He has co-written every film, directed this most recent installment and is obviously familiar with his characters. Child's Play began and continues with outrageous, shocking gore, over the top violence, language, pointless nudity, and usually manages to be political incorrect along the way. Seed of Chucky continues this path deliciously. Chucky, voiced by Brad Dourif since the original continues to do an amazing job with just his voice. Chucky wouldn't even exist without Dourif. His voice encompasses everything Chucky is. Still Chucky's look also helps. The Killer doll still has this bite to him and is hilarious to watch. His cutting quips and evil soul is fun and nasty. The new addition, Tiffany, voiced by Jennifer Tilly is the perfect addition to Chucky. I would never have thought that a partner could be pulled off for Chucky but even in Seed of Chucky she continues to be a great addition. And finally one of the greatest horror characters to date...Glen/Glenda. Billy Boyd adds such a hilarious and perfectly disturbing voice to the young Seed. Also the doll's expressions and disturbing personality makes him such a great addition. As typical and usual as this installment is, I think it's starting to lose a little steam. There wasn't the enormous vats of gore although there was a good amount, I think taboo's and red tape is putting restriction on the typical ""R"" film. Although having Tilly and Redman portray and mock themselves was an interesting spin, it's kinda been done as of recently. There was a slight lack of real story to it. But the characters redeem the film. All in all if you loved the first four, you have to continue watching because it's still a very watchable series!! 7.5/10",Seed of Chucky
28,bowmanblue,Could almost be considered a 'reboot',8,13 September 2014,"Okay, so 'The Seed of Chucky' ISN'T a 'reboot,' but it does radically shift from the previous three films' 'formulas,' making it come across as a real change of direction. The first 'Child's Play' film was a classic horror - a straight horror. Naturally (as with so many horror franchises), the sequels (parts 2 and 3) weren't received quite so well, also staying true to the original's horror vibe. Therefore, in this one (also the first 'Chucky movie' to drop the 'Child's Play' title) they decide to play it for laughs (or at least black comedy anyway).The killer doll, Chucky, returns with his - equally psychotic - 'wife' Tiffany and this time they're accompanied to Hollywood with their 'gender-confused' child, Glen (or possibly Glenda).And I thought the film was great. However, it's worth noting that there are plenty of people out there who disagree with me. I actually find the new 'black comedy' take on the Chucky films just as good as the original horrific line. But a fair share of the audience obviously didn't appreciate the change of direction.Full marks to Jennifer Tilly who not only voices Tiffany, but stars as herself and mercilessly sends herself up, portraying herself as an evil human, not an awful lot better than the evil dolls.So, expect more killing and bloodshed, only this time played for laughs rather than scares. Unless of course you find Chucky's son/daughter doll more than a little creepy in his androgynous seventies David Bowie/Ziggy Stardust kind of way!",Seed of Chucky
29,MLDinTN,extremely campy,6,20 January 2006,"Seed of Chucky is a campy comedy about killer dolls. If you didn't enjoy any of the sequels, then you won't like this. But, if you like a fun movie with some gore thrown in, then this is for you.Chucky and Tiff's child, Glen/Glenda, finds his parents in Hollywood. He isn't into the whole killing thing. He reads a chant on the back of a necklace and brings his parents to life. At the time, his parents are working on the latest Jennifer Tilly film. As usual, some killings take place and the dolls are looking for humans to transfer their spirits into. They also want to have another child and see Jennifer as the perfect mom because Tiff says she won't have another kid. So, in all its comedic glory, Chucky gets photographed by the paparazzi while he's filling a cup for the turkey baster. Next thing you know, Tiff has got Jennifer tied up using the turkey baster to impregnate her. And we learn it only takes a day to give birth to a ""voodoo"" child.Tiff pledges to stop killing but it is just so hard for her to do this, esp. with Redman in the house. And Chucky wants to make Glen a killer, who just likes to pee in his pants when scared.And there are many other scenes meant to be funny, like Tiff calling to apologize to a lady whom she killed her husband to Glen worrying over his/her ""ugly"" head.FINAL VERDICT: I liked it because I like these types of films.

The main fault is that a lot of this film just doesn't make any sense. It's hard to tell if there are scenes that are meant to be genuinely heartwarming, funny or scary. The movie's plot is that the baby seen at the ending of ""Bride Of Chucky"" named Glen is now older and became someone's ventriloquist dummy. He leaves his master to find his parents, Chucky and Tiffany and they just literally never talk about the ventriloquist for the rest of the movie. They never even say how Glen was able to get over the Atlantic Ocean!He uses voodoo to resurrect them and they try to get new bodies again. The weirdest thing is that Glen has some split personality and the movie ends by revealing that Tiffany was able to split his soul into two twin bodies or something? Oh, and she kills someone at the end even though she just said she was going to stop killing? I admit that it's at least unpredictable and I'm surprised it has the lowest score here of any of these movies. I will admit I love the scene where Chucky says he's fed up with trying to transfer his soul and is better off being a killer doll.

31,CuriosityKilledShawn,You can't keep a good guy down!,7,30 September 2006,"The Chucky films have had a curious consistency in the decline of horror and the incline of humour. Child's Play was played straight for chills. Yes, it was ridiculous but had a rather mean-spirited edge to it that made you forget how silly it was. Child's Play 2 was less savage but with a touch more humour. Child's Play 3 (a film that had an unbelievably bad reputation thanks to moronic tabloids in the UK) found the right balance between laughs and scares. Chucky was downright evil, but you began to root for him more and more because his one-liners and easily irritable personality became rather er...cute. Ronny Yu's Bride Of Chucky, while very gory, simply was not a horror film at all - an entertaining black comedy that was ridiculously over-the-top, yes, but not a horror.Now, fifth time around, series creator Don Mancini steps behind the camera, cranks the bad taste all the way up to eleven and delivers the most intelligent dumb film you've ever seen. The horror is non-existent but the gore is plentiful and the humour sicker than a syphilitic junkie. He rips out all the stop signs with such carefree abandon and directs with such hedonistic pleasure that you can't help pity other directors who take their own material far too seriously.The child born at the end of Bride Of Chucky (voiced by Billy Boyd) has been picked up by a gruff English new age traveller and made to act in a fake-ventriloquist circus show, thanks to his bizarre doll-like appearance. He knows he's not normal, suffers terrible nightmares of killing and slaughter and is eager to find his real parents.In Hollywood, a new movie called Chucky Goes Psycho, starring Jennifer Tilly, based on the Chucky urban legend is in production and when the young orphan sees a behind-the-scenes clip of what can only be his real mum and dad on TV, he escapes to Tinseltown to find out why they abandoned him. The obligatory chant to the almighty voodoo god Damballa resurrects Chucky and Tiffany, who are more than delighted to be together with their own child. Trouble is, they can't decide whether he's a boy, or a girl - a Glen, or a Glenda.However, the killer dolls are still keen to get out of their plastic bodies once and for all and be human again. Obviously Tiffany is partial to Jennifer Tilly's body and Chucky aims to switch places with rapper/actor/director Redman who is planning a new Jesus Christ movie. As you can imagine, many deaths occur along the way, much to the distress of Glen/Glenda.It sounds same-old-same-old, but let me assure you that Mancini crams as much daft humour and sick jokes in as possible. John Waters - the King of Bad Taste himself - has a hilarious extended cameo as a sleazy tabloid photographer who happens to snap a silhouetted image of Chucky hammering one off to a porno mag. How crazy is that? Chucky himself is a wonderful comic character. You just can't help but love him. Don't you think that he and Tiffany make a cute couple? He may be short but he's far scarier than Michael Myers ever was and his mere presence makes every scene a riot.Seed Of Chucky is not a film for everyone. You have to be pretty open-minded to endure the morbid humour, but it's the guiltiest pleasure you're likely to have for a long time. The self-aware Hollywood references never become intrusive and the convoluted story never becomes confusing. Still, as I have said, it's not easy going entertainment if you're a stuffy conservative.All fans of gore and brainless amusement must see. Oh, and in case you recognise the actor playing Jennifer Tilly's lawyer, that's Nicholas Rowe, better known as Young Sherlock Holmes.",Seed of Chucky
32,callanvass,Hilarious and crazily entertaining,7,30 October 2013,"Glenn is the offspring that Tiffany gave birth too at the end of Bride of Chucky. Chucky and Tiffany have been reduced to Hollywood. A movie is based off the Urban Legend, of the events of Chucky & Tiffany's brutal murders over the years. Glenn's inquisitive nature gets the best of him, and he goes to find out more about his parents. He winds up resurrecting Chucky & Tiffany, but neither one can really tell what gender Glenn truly is, or if he's an hermaphrodite. Tiffany & Chucky make a vow together, to not kill anymore, and wipe their slate clean for the benefit of their child. Chucky & Tiffany, especially Chucky have trouble keeping their promises. Chucky wants Glenn to be like him, while Tiffany wants to set a good example for him. Jennifer Tilly gets in the middle of things when she is willing to do anything to get a lead role, including sleeping with the director (Redman) Little does she know, Chucky & Tiffany want to become human againAs far as I'm concerned this outdoes Bride of Chucky in every way. It does what Bride of Chucky had trouble doing, and that's providing the laughs. It starts off with an awesome opening. The opening has tributes to Halloween, and Psycho, and I thought it was quite clever. Chucky is firmly in Freddy Kruger territory now. Gone is the creepy Chucky from the first two. He is now a comedian, firing off many hilarious one- liners. I think I enjoyed this movie because I decided to go with it, in lieu of being angry like many people were that this series went in a comedic direction. I embraced it, and had a wicked time. Watching Chucky kill Brittney Spears, by running her off the road, and cracking a joke at the expense of her straight after it, how can you not dig it? I did have trouble letting go of something. Glenn has a thick English accent, and it's highly irregular for him to be English, considering his parents are American. That being said, I did like the character inclusion of Glenn. Glenn's character brought some refreshing originality into the series. I dug that Chucky wasn't the whole show here. It was great that other characters got a chance to shine. The Nightmare on Elm Street sequels would often make Freddy the main star, but not in this one. It was a nice change of pace.I also enjoyed the gags of Jennifer Tilly & Tiffany, sharing the same voice. I won't reveal them, but they are pretty funny to say the least. Jennifer Tilly must be commended for giving a brave and committed performance. She takes many shots at herself, including her weight issues, her sinking career, and being the brunt of many harsh jokes. The girl went at it fearlessly, and I loved her performance. I've always loved the Tilly sisters; she also delivered a great show as Tiffany. The gore is laid on thick here. We get acid in the face, and someone's guts are spilled all over the floor. A bloody slit throat, a woman is burned alive, an Axe in the head, a bloody decapitation, stabbings, cut off limbs, and more. Gore hounds will be howling. Brad Douriff is a hoot as Chucky. He's embraced his comedic change by now, and doesn't let-up. He even gets off on being chopped to bits by his own kid. This dude is proud of his killing ways, and he makes sure to let everybody know it. The finale is pretty wild as well, and sets up a sequel. Final Thoughts: I had a lot of fun. 4.9?! I respect opinions, but give me a break. It's extremely underrated, and this is just a fun horror film, and one I definitely recommend for a good time. I can't wait for Curse of Chucky!7.5/10",Seed of Chucky
33,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,16 January 2015,"Seed of Chucky  For a pair of toy dolls, the hardest part of having sex is being able  to copulate before both pull-strings retract.  Miraculously, the pull-strings on the plush pair in this horror movie  lasted long enough to inseminate.  When Glen (Billy Boyd), the sedate son of psycho dolls Chucky (Brad  Dourif) and Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), revives his parents from a  supernatural slumber he unleashes their bloodlust on Hollywood.  Glen's disappointment in his murderous parents' behaviour, however,  causes them to promise their pacifist progeny that they won't kill  again.  But that promise won't stop them from possessing the bodies of actress  Jennifer Tilly and director Redman.   Meanwhile, Glen struggles with his sexuality.  The fourth sequel to the original, this installment may be one of the  weirdest yet.  More laugh-fest than fright-fest, Seed of Chucky's meta mentality is  confusing and devoid of authentic jolts.  As for infertile toy doll couples, there's always Build-a-Bear.  Red Light",Seed of Chucky

36,Thanos_Alfie,The son-daughter of Chucky...,5,28 February 2014,"""Seed of Chucky"" is the fifth movie of Child's Play series and in this one we have the son-daughter of Chucky and Tiff. This new person-doll can not decide what he or she wants to be, male or female and in this movie we observe how difficult is this for the parents and how they want to influence their child to become what they want.I liked this movie as the previous because I found it really hilarious and in combination with the whole thriller of Chucky makes it more hilarious than it is. I also liked that Chucky wants to make his child what he wants a boy and a serial killer and Tiff wants a girl and an actress.Finally I have to say that ""Seed of Chucky"" is a really unpredictable movie and that is something that makes this movie more epic and funny.",Seed of Chucky
37,johnnyboyz,Some might even come close to ceding all interest and desire to watch.,5,20 August 2009,"Whatever Seed of Chucky was trying, what with its commentary on the cynical mindsets of Hollywood big-shots and the lack of explanation of why it is that supernatural antagonists do what they do in horror films, it eventually fails to explore. The film is ultimately an intense, mean-spirited exercise; opting for lots of blood and gore by the very end after opting out of delivering on earlier promises and attempts at something quite idealistic. What elevates it slightly above the standard slasher deal is its blurring of the lines between reality and non-reality as well as the very few moments during which you feel Seed of Chucky is genuinely self-aware, feel as if it's alright to enjoy it, and go along with the ride. Whatever positives there are, are very short lived.After rather a few, a few too many in my eyes, Child's Play films throughout the 1980s and 90s; the series was kick-started with the inclusion of a mate for the infamous Chucky doll of the ironically named 'Goodguy' toy line. What was essentially a nuts and bolts slasher film with a USP built on the fact the enemy was a toy that you didn't know was alive and very much homicidal; gradually got tiresome before they gave us Jennifer Tilly's Gothic; dominatrix-inspired; border-line satanic ex-partner of the soul of the murderer that possessed the body of Chucky. For the record, I quite liked Bride of Chucky; it took me quite a while to get over the fact Chucky and his ex-partner (also in doll form) were sharing the same space as two or so human beings at the same time, but this time -were-not- cutting them up into tiny bits of meat.Seed of Chucky is an addition that doesn't hang around. If we got three or whatever films in which Chucky was on his own wiping everyone out, and only the first one was slightly interesting, then Seed wastes no time by continuing Chucky and his bride's adventures with another, separate fable and instead gives us yet another addition to the ever-growing Chucky family tree – this time in the form of some sort of sordid, Pinnochio-inspired youngster. Was it supposed to be some sort of attempt to bring a degree of juxtaposed innocence to the franchise? Does the child doll act as a means of delivering on a level of parental study? Is it supposed to be some sort of post-modernist, table turning ploy that forces the audience into considering siding with these killer toys? Maybe some sort of tactic that gets us to feel more humanely towards Chucky because he's now got a wife and a kid?Either way, Seed of Chucky manages to take inspiration from the most absurd of sources; everything from John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween to the works of cult-film maker Edward Wood. But, it is Carpetner's 70s classic stuck in the blender along with Spielberg's rather underwhelming 1997 Jurassic Park sequel that is Seed of Chucky's first point of call; as a typically rich, but hapless, English family fall prey to a miniature version of what we've all come to expect from the movie's title. The hen-sized dinosaurs of The Lost World's opening five minutes, preying on a young girl, was a stroke of rather inspired disturbance and it is the equally-sized, smaller relation to the bigger picture of which we've all come to see, that enjoys the maiming and the chaos in the opening of this picture; all the time played out in a Carpenter inspired POV shot.From here, the film reels off into a cocktail of different things; a send up-come-pastiche of how both absurd and cynical the film seems to think Hollywood is; when a black movie director named Redman, who's a musician and plays himself, wants to make a biopic about Jesus Christ and his relationship with Mary, his mother, and the best way in which to get the attention of the audience, it would seem, is to cast Jennifer Tilly, who's also playing herself, thanks to certain qualities linked to her 'appearence'. Some of the scenes they share with one another see them reminisce about the 1996 film 'Bound', and we are all instantly brought out of Seed of Chucky and onto a pleasurable plateau in which we all re-count what it's like to see Tilly when she's actually playing an interesting role, rather well, and in a good movie.There is some substance to do with children and a child's relationship to its parents, in particular its father, that is explored; too bad it's limited to scenes such as the one in which the father is impressed by his son's creativity when it comes to dropping a flask of acid on someone's head. There is also the story-line running parallel to this to do with Chucky's wife, Tiffy, who has a crisis of conscience and questions whether she should continue killing. It's an odd one; the film dares to question why its lead, evil doll character should continue the blood-bath despite the fact mostly everyone has come into this film wanting to see, well, evil dolls continuing a blood bath – one that has lasted five films. One particularly bankrupt scene, of both laughs and morals, sees her call the wife of, what I presume to be, a character she murdered in the previous film and apologise. If there is something outstanding to come out of Seed of Chucky, it might be that the idea of killer dolls; plus wife; plus son/daughter has been exhausted. What could they possibly think of next? Perhaps a golden Labrador to complete the family? No thanks.",Seed of Chucky

40,matthewssilverhammer,The only bad Chucky film.,5,31 October 2021,"Mancini is still finding his place behind the camera, borrowing from much better films, sweating hard at being shocking, & regularly finding ways to typify ""jumping the shark"" (the Matrix-style kung fu is annoying). Still, there's enough to show some promise; the horror is the scariest & most shocking of the franchise, & the comedy has its moments (I really want a Christmas Chucky movie now). It's just lost under the influence of ""Bride..."", which handles this tone with a defter hand.",Seed of Chucky
41,insomniac_rod,A new vision towards today's Horror movies. A movie like none other.,8,25 December 2004,"This is the whacked out sequel of the ""Child's Play"" series. Every popular and respected horror franchise has a crazy sequel; examples include: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Evil Dead 2, Friday the 13th part VI, and the Return of the Living Dead series. ""Seed of Chucky"" is a horror comedy that runs at high speed without brakes! Seed has no limits and respect for anyone. There's plenty of explicit violence and strong sex related jokes that's almost no present in previous Child's Play movies. If you think the doll sex scene from ""Bride of Chucky"" was too much, well, you haven't seen nothing! Seed's equivalent of the sex scene is Chucky masturbating There are more sex jokes in the movie that pop out whenever you don't expect. Gore is great here. We get a violent beheading, a burning, acid melting a man's face, and Redman getting his guts out. And as usual there's plenty of doll violence. I couldn't help but think about the Wayans brothers when watching the movie. The are many jokes a la ""Scary Movie"" that are present in Seed. The black humor used in ""Bride of Chucky"" is still in this movie but it's has been influenced by the kind of humor that SNL or the Wayans do. ""Seed"" isn't related to the original ""Child's Play"" in any way expect for Chucky doing a couple of murders. There's no suspense but it's not necessary because black humor and gore replace it perfectly. The ""Shining"" spoof is the highlight spoof of the movie. The Chucky masturbation scene is on it's way to become a very infamous moment in horror cinema. I loved the Fangoria detail. And I don't know what does Mancini has against Martha Stewart but I like it! ""Martha Stewart is being executed today"". If you thought nothing could match the ""F*** Martha Stewart"" line from Bride, you have to think twice. The Glen/Glenda sexual confusion is also a new aspect in the movies. It totally works for the movie and you can't help but laugh at some points. Glen/Glenda is a lunatic in all the sense of the word. I'm satisfied with ""Seed of Chucky"". You expect a horror comedy in the like of ""Bride"" but you get more than that. You get a nasty horror comedy that will make you love Chucky more. Jennifer Tilly is perfect in her role as, uh, herself. She does a wonderful job making fun of herself. I mean, I can't think of other actress that would stand jokes about her overweight, age, sex life, love life, reputation, or her moral behavior. She's also great to look at every time she's on screen. Her cleavage should get special mention. Her legs, her waist, oh what a hot woman. She's a great actress and now a favorite in the genre. She displayed perfectly the personal life of actresses and the clichés about Hollywood (an actress having an affair with her driver, crisis over her career going downhill, prostituting herself in order to get a good role, etc.). Mancini makes a strong critic against Hollywood and that's always very welcome. The horror genre strikes! Brad Dourif is also magnificent as Chucky; the man gave our favorite doll killer a personality and no one like him can curse and talk dirty! The Dourif-Tilly alliance is the spinal cord of the series. Chucky is damn funny, clever, cynical, violent; he's the real pimp of the movie. Chucky is an effective and brutal killer, take him seriously. Love them. Billy Boyd does a good job as Glen or Glenda. His accent works perfect for the part. Hannah (the girl from S Club 7) is also good when she appears on screen. She's very cute and I felt very sorry for her. She's a nice addition to the genre. Redman delivered and did what he could. His character didn't ask for much and he seemed to have fun playing the part. LL Cool J started this crazy liking for rappers in horror movies. Don Mancini's direction is great if you compare it to today's standards. The man knows how to create a suspense and creepy scenes. The opening of the movie is great! The POV of Glen/Glenda when killing the father is stuff to dig into. You expect the stabbing but you can't say when. Excellent scene; one of the best in the series. His takes were creative and worked perfect for the movie's quick development. If you are going to make a horror movie that deals with Hollywood, Britney Spears, and paparazzi you need fast and attractive scenes; Seed delivers.I don't know if this humor will continue if there's a future sequel but I will enjoy for many years this twisted humor that Mancini inserted in his own creation. The ""Child's Play"" franchise is very popular in the genre because of it's diversity. Don Mancini grew as a script writer and his maturity is very welcomed in the genre. First, Chucky was an evil doll, then he became a violent slasher, then he started to crack jokes like Freddy Krueger and became a vulgar slasher, until ""Bride"" where be became cynically violent. Nobody like Chucky! Chucky wisely says that he's proud of being Chucky the infamous killer doll. He should stay that way and he will increase his popularity as one of the audience's favorite slashers. I'm not sure if Tiffany and Glen will make it to the next sequel but their characters will forever be a weird and twisted addition to the genre. 8/10. ""Seed of Chucky"" is not an easy watch if you watch it with high expectations and take it as a horror movie. ""Seed"" is a twisted, black humor, horror comedy. Nastiness is the spinal cord of the movie. Nastiness in this movie divides into gore and jokes. What else can you ask for in a horror comedy?!",Seed of Chucky
42,funkyfry,What can I say? Not what it's cracked up to be,2,22 November 2004,"It's weird to say that a movie like ""Seed of Chucky"" is disappointing. Because you really aren't expecting much if you go see it. I feel plenty sorry for everyone that actually paid money to see this film. My friends and I go to a drive-in in Sacramento and I caught this one, figured it would be bad but also worth a few laughs as we drink and smoke and watch the movie. Well, this one is not even funny, sadly. I don't really know what they were going for here, except perhaps more of the same stuff from other Chucky films, so there are a lot of references to other horror films/cult films (""Glen or Glenda"", ""Rebel without a Cause"") but this only goes so far.The whole thing with having actors play themselves is somewhat interesting, but if you're going to make Redman a film director and call him ""Redman"" even though Redman is not a film director but a rapper, I don't see the point.In fact, in general, I really don't see the point. Just a failure from all possible angles.",Seed of Chucky
43,Anonymous_Maxine,You've heard of dolls that bleed? This one pees!,8,10 December 2004,"Contains Spoilers So here's my synopsis, I liked Bride of Chucky as much as the original, a little more than part 2, and MUCH more than part 3. I really think that the move toward comedy and slightly away from horror, as well as our increasing familiarity with Chucky himself, has allowed the movies, and Chucky, to look back at themselves from a different level which, as we all know by now, is a great perspective from which to have some great one-liners and horror movie homages. The appearance of various horror movie souvenirs like Jason's and Michael Meyers' masks and the Texas chainsaw as well as the re-creation of pinhead from Bride of Chucky are some examples. This is what Seed of Chucky sets out to outdo, not add to the already elaborate nature of the murders committed by the monster doll that we all nonetheless love.Seed of Chucky starts off with an odd scene. I guess I should have caught on to what was really going on in this scene, since it opens with the fruit of Chucky's loins being given as a gift to a child in the UK, the little girl's father casually eating a plate of raw steak as he looks disgustedly at the hideous little doll that arrived in the mail with no return address. I've lived in England, and to the best of my knowledge, I don't remember uncooked red meat being a great midday snack. On the other hand, I don't remember the gutterpunks traveling overseas to collect new dolls for their ventriloquist acts either.While their offspring has been given as a gift to a young British girl, Chucky and Tiff (who is sporting a brand new, totally unburned body) are starring in Child's Play 5, in this case, I believe, called Chucky Goes Psycho, one of countless classic horror film references peppered throughout the movie. My favorite was the scene where Chucky hacks through the door with a hatchet, then just as he's about to explain exactly where Johnny is, he blanks and says, 'I can't think of a thing to say!' Goofy on the one hand, but on the other hand, as in the pinhead scene in Bride of Chucky, I thought it was clever that they set up this reference to a classic horror film and then didn't even need to go through with it. They know their audience knows what's going on, and I like that.In another, more extensive reference, the movie takes place during the making of the new Child's Play movie, just like Wes Craven did in his New Nightmare. Jennifer Tilly plays herself, but Brad Dourif does not because, of course, Chucky was real all along, right? He's just hibernating while they have him hooked up to wires so they can make him act in their movie. Jennifer Tilly pokes fun at her craft and herself, complaining extensively in one scene that she never gets any good roles, that she's just as good an actress, if not better, than Julia Roberts, and that she deserves more than anyone else the role of the Virgin Mary in the upcoming Bible epic directed by, of course, rapper Redman. I have not had the nerve to put myself through How High, despite it's having been filmed at UCLA, my own backward, but I was hugely impressed with Redman's performance in this movie. He will never be able to portray a director preparing to shoot a Biblical epic, much less really direct one, but that's not the point of this movie. This entire sequence is poking fun at the fakeness of Hollywood, and it cracks me up. Besides, given the cavernous nature of Jennifer Tilly's mansion, she hardly seems to be doing too badly. Martha Stewart would be proud of her home, if not her choice of company.And speaking of cracking me up, here's something interesting. Just when you thought horror movies couldn't be unpredictable, especially in high-numbered sequels, Chucky has a cross-dressing, kung-fu fighting, Japanese-speaking British son with razor sharp teeth. Okay, the teeth were predictable, but a British kung-fu master who speaks Japanese? Where did THAT come from??The movie walks a tenuous line between an asexual nature for Glen/Glenda and outright homosexuality. The cross-dressing scene leans toward the latter, especially because not for a second from beginning to end does Glen/Glenda look or sound female. Those idiots in White Chicks looked more female than this kid. I'm assuming the choice of name is another film reference, this time to Ed Wood's 1953 film Glen or Glenda, otherwise it would seem to have been more prudent to select a name that could have been either sex, like Chris or Sam or Alex or Bill. Wait, scratch that last one.There is a scene where Jennifer Tilly sneaks onto the horror set to get a candy bar that she hid in Chucky's clothes, in another of the scenes where she pokes fun at herself (in one later scene, Tiff is dragging the unconscious Tilly and comments, 'My God she's fat'), and she comes across the head of one of the prop men, picking it up and kissing it before realizing that it's real. This is the only scene in the movie that I wasn't too impressed with. I guess I've just lost my taste for beheading scenes in the movies. But as Day After Tomorrow shows that it's okay to destroy big cities in the movies again, I guess it's okay to behead people, too. Still, however, a fun movie, but one most likely to be enjoyed by horror fans and, especially, Chucky fans.Note: Watch the movie and you'll get an idea of where the alternate title Bride of Chucky 2 comes from",Seed of Chucky
44,gwnightscream,Weakest Entry!,4,4 November 2017,"This 2004 horror sequel stars Jennifer Tilly, Brad Dourif and Billy Boyd.

He resurrects them and they head to Hollywood terrorizing the set of a movie depicting their recent, murderous events. Tilly also portrays herself who is the film's lead star. What can I say?

45,GOWBTW,Oh Please! This is too much for me to handle!,5,10 April 2006,"The real star of this movie isn't Chucky(Brad Douriff), it's Jennifer Tilly herself.

Both Chucky and Tiffany hooked up on the last movie, they bore a child who's sex is unknown to both the parents and itself. Reminds of SNL's ""Pat"". Only cornier. Glen/Glenda's dilemma complicates life for everyone.

This is driving me nuts! What's nuts about is this, the movie is way too comedic for me, there's too little horror, too much language, and a little light on the gore, which that's really no biggie to me. The others are one thing, this movie is a little too much for me to handle. The only thing I liked is when Chucky ran ""Britany"" off the road. ""OOPS! I did it again!""

46,FiendishDramaturgy,New Life for the Child's Play Line!!,3,8 January 2005,"First off, let me say that this movie is a horror COMEDY, as were the first four installments. Chucky is a wise-cracking villain (don't f-*-c-k with the Chuck) to the point of almost soliciting a painful wince from time to time, but never going so far as to knock him into the same rung as the Leprechaun franchise, which is more splatter comedy than horror.This installment was the Child's Play version of ""A New Nightmare"" in that it has breathed some LIFE into the line, thereby salvaging it from the annals of has-been franchises. It is true to the original line, carries the same feeling as Bride of Chucky, introduces a gender-confused progeny, a few clever twists, and some excellent execution.SPOILERSJennifer Tilly is great as Jennifer Tilly AND as Tiffany Ray. The way she cracked on herself (God! She's so FAT! And she's not even pregnant yet! Tiffany Ray) was priceless. At least...WE laughed. That was another thing. No one in the theater (granted, there were only 16 people including us) seemed to GET this attempt. We were laughing our butts off and everyone was looking at us like, ""What are YOU laughing at?"" They were expecting a horror, perhaps? *LOL* WE got it, and we loved it!Chucky was Chucky. There was no change in his character; a welcome element. Tiffany was much the same as she was in Bride of Chucky; intelligent, deceitful, power hungry, and loving her man (doll, whatever).The character of Glen/Glenda was a well developed, sensitive, confused little thing. It was great fun watching his/her character just...CRACK! I found this venture to be creatively written and highly enjoyable. We were thoroughly entertained.The only thing missing, IMO, was the killing. The Child's Play line was built on blood, mayhem, and a wise-cracking possessed doll. While there was plenty of mayhem, there are precious few murder scenes. Although this attempt carries the ""R"" rating, let's hope the DVD release goes a bit farther in satisfying the blood-lust most Chucky fans experience. Otherwise, I'm afraid this installment will not be the golden road to rejuvenating the franchise that Don Mancini needs.END SPOILERSWhile Chucky is a ""B"" character, this was an ""A"" treatment, as was ""Bride of Chucky."" It rates a solid 7.6/10 on the ""A"" scale from...the Fiend :.",Seed of Chucky
47,Captain_Couth,Chucky is back for a fourth time!,8,3 August 2005,"Seed of Chucky (2004) marks the return of Chucky to the silver screen. This sequel to The Bride of Chucky (1998) was to follow a year after, but it was delayed and was put on the shelf for several years. Jennifer Tilly is back as well as the series star Brad Dourif. She stars as The Bride and as herself.The story follows the sideshow life of Chucky and Tiffany's child. Their son leaves the sideshow and searches out for it's parents. meanwhile, Jennifer Tilly's career is going nowhere. She's starring in a film production about Chucky and Tiffany, the two animatronic dolls are going on a rampage in the movie. The kid finds the dolls and accidentally reinvokes the curse associated with a necklace revives both Chucky and Tiffany. The two dolls slowly get back to their old tricks. Will the kid find his true identity? Can Chucky finally find peace? Will the three become a real family? How can Jennifer Tilly make her way back into mainstream Hollywood? You'll have to find out in The Seed of Chucky!!John Waters and Redman also have guest star appearances. The movie was quite good. I was a little skeptical about watching this. But it was a worthy successor to The Bride of Chucky. The kills are bloody and the gore content is high (be sure to watch the uncut version). Jennifer Tilly was perfect in both roles and Chuckyb was never funnier. The asexual kid with two personalities was quite a sight to see. It looked like Ziggy Stardust and was named Glen or Glenda (two homages to gender confusion). Fans of the series will eat this one up.Highly recommended.",Seed of Chucky
48,kevin_robbins,Is it the beginning of the end of the series? Absolutely.,5,28 April 2021,"Seed of Chucky (2004) is a movie I recently rented off Amazon Prime for $3.99. The storyline focuses on Chucky and Tiffany's child, Glen/Glenda, who is confused about himself and his identity until he finds a way to resurrect his parents. This movie is directed by Don Mancini (Curse of Chucky and Cult of Chucky) in his directorial debut and stars Jennifer Tilly (Bullets over Broadway), Brad Dourif (Dune), Redman (How High) and Jason Flemyng (Deep Rising). The storyline for this was a bit...awful and a huge step down from Bride of Chucky. Some of the kill scenes are good, and the lines are funny, but the overall premise, writing, presentation and execution is probably the worst of the franchise until this point. Is this still a must see for fans of the series? Of course. Is it the beginning of the end of the series? Absolutely. I'd score this a 4.5/10.",Seed of Chucky

50,Chris_Docker,More nastiness from everyone's favourite psychopathic doll,6,15 May 2005,"Seed of ChuckyDo you like dolls? Do you like particularly evil looking ones? Ones that are possessed by a serial killer, and want to ensure their progeny by artificially impregnating Jennifer Tilly with their seed ? (Or just want to do horribly depraved things to Jennifer Tilly for the sake of it . . .)Chucky is an example of survivor tosh. Most of the films are incredibly badly made - but who cares? Do you complain that your popcorn isn't the correct shade of burnt phlegm? No, you just stuff it more-ishly into your mouth. And so with Chucky.Chucky's success may have a connection with something a bit darker though, and account for its cult status rather than just being another slasher sequel. Chucky is a doll. Being non-human gives him a sort of licence for any sort of badness. No moral explanation is required, no final retribution, just identify your darkest most shameful instincts with Chucky and you can remain guilt free cos a) he's only a doll and b) like any other film character, he's not real. No-one will accuse you of wanting to be a psychopathic doll for goodness sake!There's cinema (and art) that raises our awareness, often which involves a certain amount of effort on our part (like a good wholefood salad), and there's cinema that just entertains; and having Oscar-nominated Jennifer Tilly in two starring roles (as herself and as the voice of doll-bride Tiffany) does nothing to detract from this. Chucky is firmly in the latter camp of gratuitous tosh that audiences will keep going back to see. And who's to say there's anything wrong with it? Let go of all those base instincts and get them out of your system . . . Most of the great populist authors played on similar instincts (even Shakespeare and Mozart) even if they offered the intelligentsia something more at the same time. If Chucky is your cup of tea (and you'll know without reading reviews if it is) then go watch him chuck his load and be thoroughly nasty.What gives films like this breathing space when ordinary tosh simply fails without even being worthy of comment? It has been said that the ""cult film draws on a (hard)core of audience interest and involvement which is not just the result of random, directionless entertainment-seeking, but rather a combination of intense physical and emotional involvement"" - in other words a sort of mild obsessiveness. Part of the cult appeal may even include the abandonment of things that are valued by the mainstream (whether it be good acting or solid plot). Chucky makes little pretence of even covering the plot holes - who cares - we're there to see a mindlessly psychopathic doll (the main thing that makes it stand out from other slasher movies - the rest is detail.",Seed of Chucky

It's wayyy to gross, heartless, cruel, awkward, and poorly acted! I have absolutely no clue why Jennifer Tilly would agree to have any part of this garbage, maybe she lost a bet or they offered her a crap load of money. Jennifer has made some good movies, but this takes last place, hands down! The writing sucks, the acting is mediocre at best, it's wayyy to sexual, and most scenes are nasty. There are scenes that ARE way too gory. There are scenes that are just very cruel and too heartless, one scene chucky almost kills a newborn baby, and he misses and kills an innocent guy. Just the whole concept of this movie was and still is awful in every sense of the word! Oh my gosh this is one of the worst movies ever made.

53,hu675,The Best of the Child's Play Series.,8,8 June 2005,"Is it just me ? or the Child's Play films keeps getting better. In his directorial debut-Don Mancini, who wrote the whole Child's Play films. Mancini does an good job making the film look professional and making the film look big (although the budget of the film was only $10 Million!). This is probably the least expansive of the series.The Plot of the fifth film is somewhat new but always amusing. The Story is about Chucky's/Tiffany's Son or Daughter-S**tface (Voiced by Billy Boyd). S**tface always wonder how is parents look alike and who they are. S**tface finds his parents in Hollywood, when they are making a film called ""Chucky Goes Psycho"". S**tface brings his parents back to life. Now Chucky (Voiced by Brad Dourif) and Tiffany (Voiced by Jennifer Tilly) learned that they have a Son or a Daughter. Which the parents cannot decide. Since S**tface has no private parts. His parents gives S**tface a better name, now S**tface is called Glen by Chucky and Glenda by Tiffany. Since Hollywood is making a film about a possessed doll, the star of the film is no other than Jennifer Tilly! Tiffany finds the perfect body, so she could transfer her soul into the body of Jennifer Tilly. But Tilly needs an important role in her next film, she try to get the part of playing the ""Virgin Mary"" for the new film of Redman! But Tiffany has a plan to get Tilly pregnant, so she could help Glen or Glenda to transfer his or her soul into a new born baby but Chucky needs a body, it might be Redman or Chucky is finally realized being a possessed doll isn't a bad thing.This fifth film is certainly better than Ronny Yu's Bride of Chucky. In Fact, ""Seed of Chucky"" is the best of the Series. For Sure, This film has a hint of an another sequel. If they make Child's Play 6, Part 6 should be the last of the series before it gets overblown and goes way too far with a promising franchise and popular Comedy/Horror series. Tilly gives a comical performance (also great as voicing ""Tiffany""). It is a good thing Brad Dourif never got tired of voicing ""Chucky"" and that what makes the films so entertaining.Billy Boyd is also funny as Chucky's and Tiffany's new son or daughter ? or you rather call Glen or Glenda a she-male ? Some of the Creators of the film like Mancini, Producer David Kirschner, Producer Corey Sienega, Co-Producer Laura Moskowitz and Voice Talent:Brad Dourif always stay with the films. That what make the films so popular and so absurd at the same time. Filmmaker:John Waters has a small role as a Sleazy Reporter and Jason Flemyng (From the underrated George A. Romero's Bruiser and the equally underrated:The League of Extraordinary Gentleman) has a cameo also. It would have been funny, if the real Britney Spears has a Cameo but in Hollywood, you can't have everything. This is a fun, silly and gory sequel. (*** ½/*****).",Seed of Chucky

55,Jonny_Numb,"a Lifetime special...for a family of possessed, homicidal dolls",4,23 August 2005,"It is almost TOO perfect that cult director John Waters (of ""Pink Flamingos"" fame) plays a pesky tabloid photographer in ""Seed of Chucky,"" since the film itself, with all its jabs at satire and rampant disregard for political correctness (and anatomical correctness, for that matter), winds up playing like a deep-fried horror version of his own send-up of the studio system, ""Cecil B. Demented."" Writer-director Don Mancini, creator of the original ""Child's Play,"" fills the screen with stylized carnage as an abandoned doll named Glen, working as a ventriloquist's dummy, makes tracks to find his real parents, who just happen to be Chucky and Tiffany. In the meantime, a floundering Jennifer Tilly takes slutty measures to be cast as the Virgin Mary in director Redman's ""Jesus"" biopic and winds up being impregnated by the C-Man's sperm in order to give Glen a human host. Needless to say, the plot lacks balance, the satire is heavy-handed, the humor often forced, and the horror elements fail to excite (though it is rather disquieting to see young Glen in drag). I'll give ""Seed of Chucky"" at least a little credit, however, for its scattered laughs and odd counteracting of conventional family values and identity issues, as filtered through a group of knee-high, plastic-molded murderers. Though the film ultimately winds up a dissatisfying muddle, it at least puts forth an effort to defy convention.",Seed of Chucky
56,truemythmedia,One of the Best Chucky Movies,6,18 October 2019,"This is the best Chucky movie since the first film, and for fans that follow the series primarily for Chucky; this might be the best film of the series, full stop. This is easily the cleverest of the series as far as writing goes, both in terms of setting up jokes, and in terms of actual character development. It also introduces fresh ideas and characters to a series that has, for the last several entries, been somnambulant. The reason?They finally gave Don Mancini the reigns.If you look at Don Mancini's writing credits- heck, pretty much all of his credits- they all revolve around ""Child's Play"" or some kind of Chucky spinoff. The guy came up with the concept, and he's stuck with it, writing every subsequent sequel up until even the last film where Brad Dourif (""Blue Velvet"") voiced Chucky (he wasn't tapped to write the 2019 ""Child's Play"" remake). Chucky is clearly Mancini's passion project, but I honestly think the series has been rather aimless- we just watch Chucky go around slaughtering random people, never changing or moving the plot forward- that is, until this entry...This entry has homages to other horror films, inventive ideas, and some genuinely hilarious moments. Is it a good movie? I mean, no, not really, at least not when compared to actual good movies (this is no Cries and Whispers or La Dolce Vita), but as a Chucky movie, as a killer doll flick, this is easily one of the best movies in the series thus far, and thus far it's the only one that I would actually recommend other than the first one.",Seed of Chucky
57,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Not terrible but no longer as strong as it could be,5,9 January 2017,"Very few horror franchises have been able to balance dark humor into their grizzly pictures. Of the most memorable, Freddy Krueger and Chucky were the main two to do it. Out of these two, Krueger was changed over time because producers realized how quotable Krueger had become with his one-liners. Chucky had somewhat of the same knack but creator Don Mancini had been apart of each production every step of the way. As much as a failure Child's Play 3 (1991) was critically and financially to most viewers, Bride of Chucky (1998) spun that table around with a divisive decision to make itself a self-aware horror comedy. Whether it was wanted or not, Don Mancini's choice to do that was rather ingenious. It was a ridiculous concept that fit a ridiculous horror icon in a good way. Chucky was still Chucky, except this time his wisecracks were funnier. This also didn't mean sacrificing story over comedy. So obviously with a better reception Mancini would continue in that direction for this entry. Problem is he took it a little too far.Don Mancini takes full control of the production this time as writer and director. In some ways, this is a blessing and a curse. If you know how to do both really well then you're set. But if you don't, both tasks can be grueling. For Mancini, it seems like being writer/director was no problem. The issue was that he took the concept from the last film and cranked it up too much. Picking up somewhere after Bride of Chucky (1998), viewers are introduced to the offspring (Billy Boyd) of Jenn and Chucky. Wanting to find his parents, he travels to Hollywood to find his them on a studio set getting ready for a movie. The movie stars actress Jennifer Tilly. After bringing Chucky (Brad Dourif) and Jenn (Jennifer Tilly) to life, they decide that all three of them need to acquire new bodies. The people in mind were Jennifer Tilly, and a director named Redman (Redman). But to help their child, Chucky and Jenn need to inseminate Jennifer Tilly. All the while, their son is having trouble figuring out whether he's meant to hurt people or not.Unfortunately that said, much of the writing here is incomplete. Right from the start there's a big question as to how Jenn and Chucky became movie celebrities. For the past four films all their murders were unconfirmed. Plus from Bride of Chucky (1998), who recovered Chucky and Jenn's bodies? If not, who made new ones? The continuity and explanations toward these questions remain unanswered. The story is meta now and no longer self-aware. Meta can be funny but here it gets too silly. For Bride of Chucky (1998), it was comedic to give a wink and nod but to fully make it obvious to the viewer that Redman and Britney Spears were in the same universe. Also having Jennifer Tilly play along side herself is odd too. Viewers really need to suspend their disbelief that the Jennifer Tilly from Bride of Chucky (1998) is a different person from that of here. Making that clear, the comedy is a hit and miss. There are a number of scenes that are funny and others not so much. Also Chucky and Jenn's son has an underdeveloped arc.Also character motivations randomly flip throughout the story. This doesn't mix well because it feels out of character in some cases. But even with all these problems, the film proves that it isn't terrible. All the visual and audible aspects to the film work tremendously too its advantage. All actors from Brad Dourif, Jennifer Tilly, Billy Boyd, Redman and Hannah Spearritt all act passably. Of the bunch Dourif and Tilly are the best. Brad Dourif still knows how to get the best laugh. Jennifer Tilly still knows how to sound sultry, even through a doll. Billy Boyd is best known for playing Pippin from The Lord of the Rings franchise and Hannah Spearritt is from the S Club series. Boyd as the child of Chucky and Jenn plays it up on both sides. Sometimes Boyd plays it soft spoken while other times he can be deranged and unstable. The practical/special effects look great, especially the doll effects. The facial movements look legitimate and lifelike; it's impressive.The gore is also handled well. Very little of the violence is CGI and that's good because it's more believable. Since the concept has spiked in it's ridiculousness, the violence has done so too, which is fine. The cinematography by Vernon Layton is acceptable as well. Best known for working on Under Suspicion (1991), High School High (1996) and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998), Layton shows he can shoot a scene with a good-looking perspective. The music by Italian composer Pino Donaggio is another interesting pick. Donaggio's composition to this entry switches between synths and regular orchestra. The synth cues are more drawn out, while the orchestra sections involve the usual horror strings. There's also a main theme for this entry, which is nice. However the franchise should stick with one and call it a day. Donaggio's also known for his music to Piranha (1978), Carrie (1976), Tourist Trap (1979), The Howling (1981) and Body Double (1984). It's the weakest of the series but still not awful.The writing unfortunately is quite messy in its storytelling even though writer/director Don Mancini knew what he had in mind. The music, cinematography, effects and actors all do their job respectively. It's just that they're restricted by a confusing entry.",Seed of Chucky

He had a terrible life in U.K., only serving the ventriloquist purposes,and after watching his parents in television, he decides to go Los Angeles to meet them. He resuscitates his parents by accident, and after that, many people starts to be killed. Until then, Glen was different from his parents, and was not a big fan of killing people, but near the end, seeing him all dressed like Tiffanny,helping his father to kill, was much more funny than horrifying. ;)",Seed of Chucky
62,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Seed of Chucky""- An ambitious mess.",4,11 January 2017,"You've gotta give ""Child's Play"" creator Don Mancini some credit. The man is a risk-taker to a remarkable extent, and even when it hasn't served the series, he's tried to push boundaries for good- old Chucky in different ways. After injecting a clever, postmodern riff into the popular slasher franchise with 1998's drastically underrated ""Bride of Chucky"" by incorporating elements of comedy and romance, Mancini takes the helm for the first time in his directorial debut. An attempt to satirize and pay tribute to classic domestic dramas like ""Kramer VS Kramer"", ""Seed of Chucky"" has plenty of ambition and nothing but the best of intentions. But sadly, it all-too-often falls prey to an unfortunate sense of self-indulgence and the clear signs of a first-time filmmaker in just a bit over his head. It's a mess... but at least it's an ambitious and wickedly creative mess.Some time after the events of the last film, the living-doll child (voiced by Billy Boyd) of Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) and Tiffany (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) has been kidnapped by a ""punk ventriloquist"" who exploits him for fame. After seeing the inanimate bodies of his parents on the news, being used as props for the production of a horror film based on the ""urban legend"" of Chucky the killer doll, the child escapes and makes his way to Hollywood. Using a voodoo amulet, he brings his parents back to life (I guess the dolls being used in the movie were the real-life dolls that were found at the crime scene at the end of ""Bride"" according to the in-movie logic?) and shocks them with the revelation that they are now parents. Tiffany and Chucky are dumbfounded, especially as Tiffany decides it's time for them to hang-up the knives and stop killing (rationalizing it to be a bad influence on their child), while Chucky still wants to carry on his old ""hobby."" They also quarrel over whether their child is a boy or a girl, with Chucky calling him ""Glen"" while Tiffany refers to him as ""Glenda."" At the same time, the family decides it time to transfer their souls into human bodies once and for all, setting their sites on actress Jennifer Tilly (also playing herself) and rapper Redman, while also scheming to impregnate Tilly to create a baby which Glen/Glenda can inhabit.To give credit where it is due, Mancini does craft an often entertaining and sometimes genuinely hilarious tale, even when it frequently goes off the rails. The general premise of following up a romantic-thriller with a domestic drama is an inspired concept, and the film's numerous layers of subversion and fourth-wall breaking meta-humor are often amusing. I particularly liked the idea of Tilly playing herself and becoming the target of Tiffany's affection and fascination. I also have to say that the ""human storyline"" involving Tilly as a down-on-her-luck actress is often genuinely well-told. It almost would have made for an interesting film itself without being part of a larger ""Child's Play"" storyline. And of course the voice-acting from our three leads is just fantastic. Dourif is amazing as always, and it's honestly a ton of fun to see the character being put in a more comedic light than usual. Tilly does great work as Tiffany and gets some of the film's biggest laughs. And Billy Boyd is a very welcome addition.Unfortunately, the good-will earned by the excellent concept, humor and casting can't quite save the film as a whole. As I said above, Mancini is a bit too self-indulgent, and by the time the second-act rolls around, the constant gags and levels of irony start to wear a little thin. Jokes start to seem forced around the time Chucky murders a Britney Spears look-alike (that's not spoiling anything, don't worry) and a paparazzi photographer played by the delightful John Waters begins making non-stop wisecracks while stalking the Tilly residence. What was clever at first becomes a crutch by the film's midway point and eventually the film loses focus in its attempts to generate non-stop laughs and the occasional jump. There's also a marked step-down in terms of production value and I can't help but feel that for a first-time director, Mancini might have bit off a bit more than he could chew. From the general structure and flow of sequences to the basic facets of visual storytelling like composition and movement, you get the sense that Mancini might have been a bit in over his head. For how inspired the storyline might have been, the same inspiration is not present in his visual direction. Thankfully, this seems to have been a good learning experience for Mancini, as he did an absolutely excellent job helming the follow-up ""Curse of Chucky""... it's just a shame that he stumbled so badly here.While it is a mess and without doubt one of the low points in the franchise, I can't help but still see some value in ""Seed of Chucky."" Call me a pushover, but I'll take an interesting failure or an ambitious mess any day of the week... if for no other reason than to support the creativity that went into it. Just because a film doesn't work, doesn't mean it didn't come from a pure place. And if you watch the behind-the-scenes footage, you can tell that Mancini, Tilly and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place and were trying their best to make a fun and entertaining follow-up. It didn't work, but they tried and you can feel it in just about every scene.I'm giving ""Seed of Chucky"" a sub-par but very watchable 4 out of 10. It's an interesting and highly ambitious mess. And I get a feeling that the open-minded will find a lot to like, much as I have. Just don't go in expecting perfection.",Seed of Chucky
63,Pumpkin_Man,'Get A Load Of Chucky'!!!,10,26 September 2008,"I thought this was a really good sequel to the franchise. I love when Chucky and Tiffany kill some guy and blood is splashing everywhere, and they play romantic music. 5 years after Chucky and Tiffany died and Tiffany gave birth to a child, the child has grown a little older and wants to know what his parents are like. While working for a mean ventriloquist, their son sees them on t.v. because Hollywood is making a Chucky movie. Their son escapes and goes to Hollywood to look for them. He finds them and uses the voodoo amulet(the ""Heart of Damballa"" from the previous film) to bring them back to life. After they wake up, Chucky makes fun of his son, not knowing who he is, but soon finds out that it is his son. They name him Glen. Glen wants nothing to do with killing, so Tiffany wants to stop, cold turkey, but Chucky is reluctant. Tiffany finds out that Jennifer Tilly is playing her in the movie, but Jennifer wants a better part, so she sees Redman about playing the Virgin Mary in his Bible epic. He refuses at first, but Jennifer wants to have her way with him in order to get the part. (That lucky guy!) Later at Jennifer's house, Chucky and Tiffany make a plan to transfer their souls into Redman and Jennifer, but they need a baby for Glen's soul, so Chucky has to jack-off in order to get Jennifer pregnant. During getting Jennifer pregnant, Chucky takes Glen on a 'Boys Night Out' and kill some people, such as Britney Spears! After Jennifer becomes pregnant, Chucky and Tiffany hold Jennifer hostage in her own home. After Tiffany helps deliver the baby, another baby comes out. During the chaos of the screaming babies, Tiffany yelling at Chucky to do the chant, Jennifer yelling for help, and Glen being confused about his gender, after 5 movies, Chucky decides to stay a doll. Tiffany doesn't so Chucky decides he wants to kill her. Later at the hospital, after Chucky kills Tiffany in doll-form, a final battle between father and son ensues.

It has a more comedic tone to it than the other films. I'm glad the actor who plays Tiffany stars in this film again as some Hollywood actor. She was playing in a movie about murderous dolls chucky and his wife. Their non-binary child came from England and found them and revived them with the necklace.That Tiffany was trying to quit his killing addiction and having a slip here and then was really funny. They impregnated the actress to ditch their doll bodies including their child. But chucky wanted to stay in his doll body because he thinks it sucks to be a human. And Tiffany wanted to walk out on her and he killed her. Glen/Glenda snapped and chopped his father's limbs and head off. But Tiffany was already switched bodies. She started to live her life with her twins and the boy was Glen. Then a birthday present arrived and it was his father's arm and it attacked him.It was fun and cheesy early '00s slasher with some nice killings. There're very random American actors playing British characters in this which is so unnecessary but around this time Hollywood always used to have some random British characters in such movies.",Seed of Chucky
65,IonicBreezeMachine,The Chucky series goes even further into comedy/satire with interesting if not necessarily successful results.,4,21 October 2021,"Following the events from the last film, Chucky (Brad Dourif) and Tiffany's (Jennifer Tilly) offspring (Billy Boyd) has since grown to ""full"" doll size and lives a life of abuse and neglect as a puppeteers ""dummy"" in England after having been found in the cemetery. Meanwhile in Hollywood, Jennifer Tilly (herself) is doing a film based on the unsolved murders surround Chucky called ""Chucky Goes Psycho"" and is unsatisfied with the turn her career has taken. Hearing that rapper turned director, Redman (himself), is doing a movie about The Virgin Mary, Tilly sees this as the opportunity her career desperately needs. Chucky's offspring catches a glimpse of Chucky and Tiffany while watching Access Hollywood and discerns the two are his parents and abandons his abusive ventriloquist and sets off to Hollywood. Once in Hollywood, the offspring brings Chucky and Tiffany back to life where the three form an unconventional family unit and decide to use Jennifer Tilly and Redman as vessels to bring themselves and their child (named either Glen or Glenda depending on the situation) into human form.Following the success of Bride of Chucky development began on a sequel tentatively titled ""Son of Chucky"". Series creator/writer Don Mancini wanted to explore LGBTQ in an effort to add something more personal to the franchise, creating the character of Glen/Glenda in homage to the Ed Wood movie Glen or Glenda to explore gender dysphoria. Universal expecting a more standard and conventional slasher rejected the script which remained in development hell until the success of Cabin Fever spurred renewed interest in horror projects giving Mancini's film, now Seed of Chucky, the push it needed to get support from Focus Features revival of Rogue Pictures. The movie was not well received by critics or audiences with the film becoming the second lowest grossing entry ahead of Child's Play 3 (though attendance was likely greater for CP 3) and to date is the last theatrically released Chucky/Child's Play film. There are nuggets of good ideas in Seed of Chucky, but in execution it comes off as a confused mess that seems unsure of itself.Seed of Chucky is two movies really: on the one hand Seed of Chucky is a satire of Hollywood/Celebrity with Jennifer Tilly and Redman playing exaggerated caricatures of themselves as Chucky wreaks havoc around them, and on the other it's a story of Glen/Glenda trying to find their identity in relationship to their parents and the uncertainty that comes from lack of identity. It's hard to point out exactly why the movie doesn't work except that it feels like we have two very different ideas that aren't given the breathing room to build and develop. Glen/Glenda often disappears for long stretches as we focus on ""quid-pro-quo"" exaggerations of Hollywood deals, satire on 12 step/addiction recovery, and various other sideplots/subplots that don't really go anywhere. Even when the character of Glen/Glenda is focused on they don't really have all that much to their character and the attempts at trying to discuss gender identity seem sincere and well intentioned, but it's done in the context of two killer dolls and their child so it doesn't really resonate all that well because the oddness of the situation detracts from the content. Even comedically speaking the movie isn't firing at the same level as Bride of Chucky with scenes like Chucky masturbating, Tiffany flashing her breasts, or the various potshots at Hollywood not really landing with all that much impact. Jennifer Tilly does seem like she's having fun playing herself and Tiffany and on occasion there are some inspired bits such as effects artist Tony Gardener playing himself in a scene where he's brutally and horrifically killed, but other scenes such as the usually reliable John Waters or a scene where Chucky runs Britney Spears off the road just feel forced.Seed of Chucky is not in the same league as the previous 4 entries. While the movie tries to tackle gender dysphoria in a sympathetic way with the character of Glen/Glenda, it doesn't mesh all that well with the established slasher elements or Hollywood satire with none of the elements really given the breathing room needed to develop. Seed of Chucky positions itself as first and foremost a comedy and as a comedy I didn't laugh nearly enough to recommend it. It's not an outright failure as it does try to incorporate some unique ideas, but unfortunately those ideas just aren't allowed to take root and flourish.",Seed of Chucky
66,Fernando-Rodrigues,The son of Chucky,6,4 February 2021,It's a well-humored movie that plays with metalanguage. But Bride of Chucky is WAY better! This one is just cheesy in a funny way. It also has an interesting gender discussion.,Seed of Chucky
67,ODDBear,Should have been better,5,31 March 2009,"""Seed of Chucky"" is not the worst in the ""Child's Play"" series, that honor goes to the third installment.Screenwriter of the original film, Don Mancini, takes directing chair here and attempts to recapture ""Bride's"" offbeat humor but steers it in a weird direction and it doesn't pay off as well as is should. The visual style of ""Bride"" is absent, the kills here are clumsy, there's far too much of Jennifer Tilly here and the offspring is really irritating. Plus, they failed big time on the gore here, which was so well done in ""Bride"".But Chucky delivers the goods, John Waters has a really funny role here and a few moments do work quite well. All in all; should have been better.",Seed of Chucky
68,ivo-cobra8,I f****** hate this movie abomination the worst sequel and a failure,1,19 August 2017,"*MAJOR SPOILERS* So today I re watch both of these movies thank god there are only 6 movies and one more film I have to watch then I am done with this franchise.What I can I say about this film? This film f***** sucks!!! This film is the worst horror film ever made! Far worst then Bride of Chucky and the worst one in the entire series! Whoever says this movie is good must really be damn insane! This movie is un watchable, this movie sucks so damn much I hate this movie! Far worst than Bride of Chucky! Jennifer Tilly is far worse in acting than she was in Bride this movie is not a horror movie is not good is not Chucky. This is even worse it is not scary, it is not well acted it is so f***** peace a sh*** lame asshole STINKER movie I can't even describe!!!!! This movie is stupid in every way retarded. I can't believe that Tiffany betrayed Chucky on the end and wanted to go in Jennifer Tilly! Jennifer Tilly acted her self, well kiss my ass actress! New Nightmare kicked the s*** out of this f**** movie out! Heather Langenkamp acted her self and that movie was a classic comparing to this! I will not buy this movie I will stay away from this from now on! Seed of Chucky is the fifth movie in Child's Play franchise and the worst one.This film for me personally is one of the worst films I've ever seen and I have seen a lot of stinker movies but this one is the bottom of the line! It's one of my most hated sequels ever. It's painful to sit through. The ""comedy"" could be the worst I've ever seen in a movie. The stupid ideas continue from where bride of Chucky left off. I can't stress this enough, Chucky having a kid is a STUPID idea! I sound like a broken record here. I hate this movie with a passion! F*** this movie and Don Mancini, f*** you too! To me Child's Play 1,2 and 3 is the trilogy and Bride, Seed and Curse of Chucky are spin offs because they don't have anything to do with the original 3 movies. That's why I call them spin offs and call the first 3 movies a trilogy.﻿Seriously, you go to IMDb and there are people who likes Bride and Seed better than Child's Play 2 and 3 are you f***** kidding me!!! This movie is better the 2 and 3? How? Why? There is no way that this movie is better then those 2 not even close, I call bull sh** on that I really do.The only likable is Hannah Spearritt as Joan she is the only likable in this movie and she did nothing wrong when she tried to help Jennifer Tilly I like her only her but that's my opinion. This is a crazy train wreck Don Mancini sucks he stinks in this film Jennifer Tilly sucks in this. She is unlikable, irritating unlikable she is awful her voice is horrible. Chucky is jerking his dick off, Tiffany showing her awful bops horrible. I hate this film I hate it so damn much!!!! Child's Play 1 and 2 are the best one Child's Play 3 is superior than this awful crap and honestly in my opinion this film is not funny. This film is damn awful movie and I am tired of sequels after sequels after sequels. Billy Boyd you are horrible as Glen, Glenda you keep piing your pens. How does Chucky drives a car and kills Britney Spears when in Bride of Chucky couldn't drive a car? makes no sense! This movie made me really tired and exhausted and very angry!!!!! F 1/10 avoid this movie like a plague uncles you like this film I don't!!!",Seed of Chucky
69,TheNorthernMonkee,"funny, but slow to start and inconsistent",7,13 May 2005,"SPOILERS When original horror film ""Child's Play"" was released in 1988, creator Don Mancini probably would never have expected to be directing the fourth sequel, sixteen years later. ""Seed of Chucky"" is certainly not going to be what he imagined his series would lead to. Whilst ""Child's Play"" was so extreme that it was banned for years, this latest edition is a brilliantly daft film with some extreme violence and some equally good jokes. It does have some major problems, not least an irritating character or two, but it's still worth a watch.Chucky (Brad Dourif) is dead. His partner Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) is also dead. Estranged son/daughter Glen/Glenda (Billy Boyd) is very much alive and being exploited by a 'ventriloquist' though. Upon mistakenly believing that his parents are living in Hollywood, the young dummy sets off to meet his parents. Together the three will then deal with family issues, addiction and film star Jennifer Tilly (as herself) as they once more embark on a blood stained killing spree.As you'd expect from one of these films, the story begins slowly and it doesn't really get going until the appearance of the star of the show. This in itself is bearable if not for the simple fact that the spawn of Chucky is an annoying David Bowie (imagine Ziggy Stardust and you've got the kid pretty accurately) lookalike with a nerve grating voice. If you force yourself to tolerate this first woeful twenty minutes though, the film and the child, both improve remarkably and by the end, you come out of the film happy and reminiscing over the funnier parts.The reason ""Seed of Chucky"" does work as it progresses is that Mancini has a talent for writing joke laden, spoof filled, scripts splattered with random violence. With deaths involving knives, wire, fire and acid, your never short on gruesome violence and special effects. It's true that the deaths are not as original as some of the more radical deaths in previous films, but sometimes classics are just too entertaining to ignore.Involvement of minor actors with cameos also help the film to thrive. Aside from the full screen appearance of Jennifer Tilly as herself, a brief appearance by rapper Redman is brilliant notably for the fact that he gets exactly what he deserves. Tilly by comparison is involved for the entire film and deserves credit mainly for the fact that she pokes fun at herself and Hollywood in general. Yes some of the jokes go over the head as they're either too personal or not funny, but the majority are humorous and based around the fact that she voices Tiffany too.Dumb and gore based, ""Seed of Chucky"" is a worthy continuation of the series. Not quite as good as ""Bride of Chucky"" or as lively, it remains a thoroughly entertaining film throughout. It's not worth denying that Chucky's child bears a remarkable similarity to Ziggy Stardust, but the character, just like the film, grows on you distinctively as the film progresses. A dumb film maybe, but an entertaining one too.",Seed of Chucky
70,swilliky,Full comedy version of Chucky as he grows his family,4,30 October 2017,"The murderous doll Chucky (Brad Dourif) procreated at the end of the last film so this film picks up with the ugly result Glen (Billy Boyd). Somewhere in England, the ugly doll has nightmares of killing a family and is used by a British ventriloquist to scare crowds and tell crude jokes. In Hollywood, the lifeless Chucky and Tiffany doll are used to make a Chucky movie. Jennifer Tilly voices the Tiffany doll while also playing herself as a struggling actress trying to land a big role. Glen escapes his owner and jumps into a garbage truck. He catches a fly across the Atlantic and arranges a delivery to the Hollywood prop room. He discovers his parents but they are lifeless so he reads the back of his necklace and brings the two murderous dolls back to life. The first thing the Tiff and Chucky do is kill a prop manager. Tilly tries to land a role as the Virgin Mary by seducing the director Redman. Once Tiff sees Tilly, who discovers the body, she knows she must get into the actress's body. Glen is unsure of his gender so Tiff refers to him as Glenda since he doesn't have any genitals. He does pee his pants whenever he sees violence and wants to know why his parents kill people. Tiff makes Chucky promise not to kill anyone but he crosses his fingers. The three dolls sneak into Jennifer Tilly's limo and ride with her back to her house where she prepares to seduce Redman. The dolls come up with a plan to artificially inseminate Tilly and to take the two bodies for their own. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Seed of Chucky
71,deatman9,Now they are just trying to make us laugh.,6,26 October 2012,I remember when I was little and the first Childs Play came out. Am I mistaken or was that supposed to be a horror film? Because you could never tell with the way these last two installments went. They are just pure silliness and comedy. I actually rather enjoyed this one because I laughed so much.This movie is about Glen the young offspring off the two killer dolls chucky and tiff. (how dolls reproduce I have no idea) Once he finds out there is a Hollywood movie being made about the myth of his parents so he decides to raise them from the dead and the trio begins to reek havoc on the world.This movie was actually better then the last couple and only because it was so silly that its actually a funny enjoyable movie. Don't take it seriously and you will probably enjoy it. much better then bride of chucky thats for sure.,Seed of Chucky
72,DarthVoorhees,Awful most awful,1,14 June 2005,"You can't say I don't enjoy horror comedies or Chucky movies,hell Bride of Chucky was hilarious in my opinion.Seed is a failure,an absolute failure of a movie.Don Mancini the man who created Chucky and wrote his scripts for 17 years,who ingrained one of the most beloved horror icons into pop culture wrote and directed an absolute mess of a movie.Frankly I think Seed would have worked much much better if this whole Jennifer Tilly plot was dropped.Wes Craven created an inspired idea with his New Nightmare,the problem is it never has really died.I've even heard rumors of a Halloween following this Movie within a Movie set up being planned.The reason Bride of Chucky was so well is because it was original.The Tiffany character added a lot to the Chucky series creating one of the most funny Horror/Comedy hybrids ever.The Tiffany character was over-the-top which was why she worked so well.I never thought I'd say it but this is the precise reason Seed of Chucky fails,Tiffany overshadows Chucky the true star.Chucky''s son/daughter Glen or Glenda doesn't add anything at all,the whole gentle doll thing fails.The movie has some redeeming qualities but they are two far between.I laughed hard when Chucky has some father/son time with Glen/Glenda,and of course Chucky and Tiffany watching the Martha Stuart trail.I know Don Mancini can make a great horror comedy but this plot just didn't show his potential.I look forward to Child's Play 6 which should have the Tiffany character eliminated.",Seed of Chucky

The ""Doll Family"" dynamic going on was quite the treat as well! and Chucky's sudden fatherly instincts which were awesome,as was Glen's gender confusion cracking me up (Glen looked exactly like Michael Jacksonlol) or Tiffany's attempts at kicking the ""slash, slash"" habit putting the screws on me. Add to all that sweeter than sweet bonbon; extreme gore (the beheading rocked), stellar special effects, movie references galore (loved The Shining one).Brad Dourif as Chucky can do no wrong, Jennifer Tilly starring as herself and Tiffany the doll were spot on Billy Boyd (Glenn) worked as the voice of the he/she child. I guess Redman (Redman) played Redman and former S Club 7 singer Hannah Spearitt was cute and credible as Joan although not given much to do, but she does have an awesome painful death scene.All in all the Doll Family dynamic worked, and although this one is not quite as strong as ""The Bride Of Chucky"" it still worked and yet another worthy sequel.",Seed of Chucky

75,django-1,Bravo! An amazing showcase for Jennifer Tilly--an instant classic!,10,25 November 2004,"I haven't seen a Chucky film since the first one, but with Jennifer Tilly ""playing herself"" and with John Waters in the cast, I figured I'd give this a chance, and I'm glad I did. While Chucky (Brad Dourif) and his wife Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) and their child Glen/Glenda (Billy Boyd) are entertaining, the film is really a vehicle for Jennifer Tilly, playing ""herself"", in other words, an exaggerated version of her public persona. And she is incredibly funny and incredibly daring in that role. For me, this is the performance of the year. I know that Ms. Tilly has a rabid following who see every film she is in, but now I am joining that fold. This film is funny, scary, a wonderful satire of Hollywood and the cult of celebrity. I don't know why others have put down Redman, but he is perfect for his role...also playing an exaggerated version of his public persona. If anyone doesn't ""get"" this film, then I guess they don't ""get"" performers such as Mae West or Jayne Mansfield. With this film, Jennifer Tilly should be elevated to that level of greatness. Yes, she is a fine actress who can play any kind of role convincingly, but she also has an aura about her that one cannot buy or train for. There are a few jokes about Julia Roberts in the film, but as Tilly herself surely knows Ms. Roberts could not have gotten away with a role such as this (although she did in a way play a similar role in FULL FRONTAL). Writer-director Don Mancini has hit a grand slam with this film, which will surely become a cult classic. Of the hundreds of films I have rated on the IMDb, this is one of the dozen or so that deserves an unqualified ""10."" John Waters is perfect for his role as a sleaze reporter--that he was offered a role in the film shows that the filmmakers surely know their lineage! Finally, there is a wonderful musical score by the legendary Italian composer Pino Donaggio. I can't imagine how a Chucky 6 could follow up this film, but the minds who created this amazing film can probably surprise us once again. However, should they choose to retire the franchise with this entry, they will be going out on top. I'll be buying the DVD the day it comes out. And I need to get a picture of Jennifer Tilly for my wall!",Seed of Chucky
76,TalesfromTheCryptfan,A dismal sequel but not as horrible as the next 2!,3,13 November 2017,"Six years after Tiffany (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) gave birth to a baby doll at the end of ""Bride of Chucky"", the offspring who was taken by a ventriloquist (Keith-Lee Castle) whom the offspring would later be called Glen/Glenda (voiced by Billy Boyd) who is basically transgendered when it has two souls of different sexes in him/her, as he/she discovers where his real parents are especially Chucky (voiced by Brad Douriff) are in Hollywood on the set for a horror movie called ""Chucky goes Psycho"" where Jennifer Tilly plays herself besides voicing Tiffany. Glen/Glenda goes to Hollywood where has the amulet ""Heart of Dambella"" with him to bring his parents back to life, as they are reunited Glen/Glenda is unlike the two of them as he/she thinks killing is wrong and Chucky wants to set a good example for his son. Tiffany comes up with a plan to impregnate Jennifer Tilly with Chucky's semen so that she can give birth to a baby, so that way Tiffany can transfer her soul into Jennifer as Glen/Glenda can transfer his/her soul into the baby and Chucky can find a human male host for the soul to be in.Co-starring Redman with cameo by John Waters, this 5th installment of the franchise which is written and directed by Don Mancini is terrible but not as god-awful as the 6th and 7th movies. After development hell since 1998 after the success of Bride of Chucky when Son of Chucky was being written, Universal passed on to it and waited until 2003 when Universal's Focus pictures which made a horror division called Rogue Pictures bought the script and filmed it for a November 2004 release. The film did badly at the box-office and got bad reviews, i agree with that as i was curious about this movie seeing it in theaters and what i got was a pile of horse crap. Not scary and not funny at all as it's trying to be funny but becomes a pure failure at attempting. This is the movie where you get to see Chucky wack off which is something fans don't want to see! The characters are unlikable especially Glen/Glenda whom is an irritating character despite Billy Boyd did a good vocal performance which is funny how he and Douriff were from the Lord of the Rings films. The humor is too meta and knowing about itself as it's trying to be New Nightmare on aspects but fails at that. Don Mancini at this movie made his directorial debut and seems very amateurish as he feels bad as a director and poor as a writer as he seems to lost his touch after Child's Play 2 or 3 as CP 2 was better written than this piece of crap especially Fitting Punishment on Tales from the Crypt which he co-wrote. Mancini thinks he is funny to have Tiffany flash her doll knockers or Chucky jerking his chain, nice try to be funny Don but you fail at humor as your writing is very poor here. Tony Gardner's puppet and practical effects are some of the saving graces of this cluster-screw of a sequel yet that karate fight of Glen and Chucky was unbelievably lame/dumb and a poor attempt to be funny plus there's also the idiotic ending.Then we have 2 more awful sequels to come.",Seed of Chucky

Where Bride of Chucky took on elements of absurd comedy that worked, this film takes all those elements and exploits them even further, making a movie that's not enjoyable by any standard. It's not one of those ""so-bad-it's-good"" kind of movies; it's just a bad movie.
Billy Boyd plays a gender-confused child of Chucky and Tiffany (ahead of its time) that looks like the lovechild of Tim Burton and David Bowie. A lot of the film focuses on this soft-hearted British child with a love of life and a disdain for the family position.
It's got a killer (no pun intended) cameo from John Waters, who perhaps has one of the best dearh scenes in the entire franchise, but beyond that, this is a film that is very easily forgettable once the credits start to roll.",Seed of Chucky

Until now, I have prided myself for never giving up on a film, for always giving stories and plots a fair chance, and for being able to find the minute positives even in films I did not completely enjoy. But Seed of Chucky has defeated me. I have managed to survive 33 minutes of it, and I've had enough. Please, please no more!It appears those in charge of the Chucky project insist on digging their own professional graves deeper. After succumbing to Chucky's status as a joke, they have decided to capitalize on how bad everything about these projects is, and turn themselves into an ironic parody of everything they'd used to stand for. After stealing from slasher classics, Mancini now steals from Pinocchio (only his name is Glen, or her name, the doll is too gender-less and androgen in the same time, showing just how desperate for support the cast is...) Also, it appears the worst ""Horror"" film ever has decided to steal from the worst action film ever, and now actress Jennifer Tilly plays as herself playing Tiffany playing herself playing Tiffany playing whatever the heck that is... You deserve better, Tiffany. Much better.I do not know how the story continues or ends, and I couldn't care less. Never in my life have I been exposed to such a terrible pile of cinematic rubbish. If you're a Chucky fan, of course you'll love this film. Then again, if you're a Horror fan, run before Mancini destroys all your appreciation for the genre.

One character has acid dumped on his head and we get to see his face dissolve.Another has his stomach cut open and we see his intestines fall out all over the floor.The first time I watched this movie, I had to close my eyes on that part.4) I love Chucky's lines.Whenever he talks, He's either gonna say something scary or something funny.In 'Seed of Chucky', his lines are always a hoot and a holler.Can't wait for the 6th film.",Seed of Chucky

And then I discovered this On-Demand.I will have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. I don't know if it was the acting, directing, or just the complete story, but I really enjoyed this one. It seems a psychiatric patient just could not comes to grips with the fact Chucky had offed her family; she thought she had done it. While she is being rehabilitated in another hospital, she has an unforeseen visitor, soon the little lady is going down the path to loony-tunes again! Won't give any more of the plot away, but I will say this: I was surprised on the amount of gore in this film!Not bad for a film that was not that heavily promoted. You can't judge ALL books by the cover. Give this one a peek!! Rated R for strong gore and language.",Seed of Chucky
82,christian123,Decent but Chucky isn't the star,4,27 November 2004,"Chucky the killer doll (voiced by Brad Dourif) and his wife Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) are back from the dead thanks to their pacifist son Glen (voiced by Billy Boyd). For the fifth film in the franchise, they head to Hollywood when they learn that a movie is being made about them, and of course, Chucky and Tiff go on a Hollywood style murder spree, which forces their son to try to stop them.What was once a promising franchise is now kind of a joke to watch. The first movie was pretty good, offering enough scares and thrills to satisfy the viewer. The second and third films were bad sequels that offered no scares or thrills. The Bride of Chucky was an improvement over the last two sequels but it was still missing something that made the first one good. So, where does Seed of Chucky fit in? I'm sad to report that this latest entry is closer to the bad sequels than to the original. It's better than the second and third entry but the film is kind of a dud itself. First, there is a lot of gore but the film is not scary. Even the death scenes are a bit disappointing.Second, Seed of Chucky is actually more of a comedy than a horror film. The director tries to mix these two genres together and it just doesn't work. Besides for Jennifer Tilly, most of the jokes are lame and Chucky is just not that funny. Third, Don Mancini really dropped the ball and focused more on the comedy aspect instead of actually trying to put real scares in. The story actually had potential to be scary and it completely failed. The only saving grace in Seed of Chucky is Jennifer Tilly. She offers a funny, engaging performance and she's such a good sport for making fun of herself. She is the only thing that keeps this film alive. The rest of the supporting cast include Red Man and Hannah Spearritt. Neither of them do anything special though. For me, this film was a major disappointment and I really hope this is the last movie of the franchise. In the end, this film is better left on the shelf. Rating 5/10",Seed of Chucky

The first two sequels were slightly better, although were just this side of passable. The declining interest of films using the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET formula caused the end of the Chucky saga in the early 1990s. But in 1998, the producers resurrected the series with BRIDE OF CHUCKY, which was the same as the previous films except for having two killer dolls for the price of one, as well as having a streak of dark comedy. The film was successful at the box office, leading to Seed of Chucky six years later.Glen, the child of possessed dolls Tiffany & Chucky, heads to Los Angeles where he resurrects his parents. Tiffany decides to transfer her soul into the body of actress Jennifer Tilly, who is planning to further her career by sleeping with Redman (who is planning to direct a film about the Virgin Mary). At the same time, Tiffany decides to give up serial killing for the sake of Glen's future, something that doesn't sit well with Chucky.Seed of Chucky is perhaps one of the better Child's Play films out there, mainly for director Don Mancini's expert writing skills (he wrote all the films in the series). The plot has a mean streak a mile across, with some surreal gags poking fun at everything from religion-based films (more on that later), the mechanics of Hollywood & the downside of fame.The acting is a mixed bag. Jennifer Tilly should get some sort of ""good sport"" award for going ahead with this film with an amazing determination, allowing herself to be on the receiving end of derogatory gags aimed at her career & personal ethics. The rest of the cast, excepting the dolls, are not as good, but are still serviceable (the sole exception being Redman, who seems to be nothing more than an arrogant pig).The downside - & this one's a real humdinger – Mancini does not know when to stop, with the film's rather dubious subplot involving Redman making a film about the Virgin Mary. The very idea of a rapper making a film about her is morally suspect, to say the least (that point alone takes a mark off my score). That said, the rest of the film is quite entertaining – just watch the scene where Chucky runs Britney Spears off the road or the throwaway news piece about Martha Stewart being executed.",Seed of Chucky
84,akshatmahajan,Entertaining but without taste of originality,5,30 June 2021,"Seed of Chucky (Child's Play 5) is entertaining but doesn't have any taste of horror with which this franchise started. Movie is continuation of Bride of Chucky and like fourth part, this part was also just timepass.The movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second. Also there are a few gory murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the film never stops moving.The acting was bad. The direction was also bad. With the story this much weak, a strong direction was needed. The pacing was normal. What made this movie different from earlier parts was that it didn't have any proper horror element. Movie was just comprised of violence and humour. The special effects were properly used, thank God for that.Overall, the movie is a fun ride but it may fail to satisfy even those who love watching Child's Play franchise.",Seed of Chucky
85,Donatien3,ridiculous fun,8,14 August 2013,"There's only one way describe 'Seed of Chucky': a bizarre, shameless, ridiculous self-parody.While the Child's Play series has gradually evolved from straight slasher to comedy-horror, 'Seed' throws away all delusions: it revels in parody – of Hollywood, of the horror genre, of the Child's Play series and Jennifer Tilly. Say what you want about Ms. Tilly, but she's not afraid to make fun of herself. In 'Seed' she plays herself and reprises her role as Tiffany from 'Bride of Chucky.' Tilly eagerly makes fun of her weight, her stagnating career, her sex appeal (willing to sleep with rapper Redman to win the role of the Virgin Mary in a retelling of the Bible) and her unique/sexy/irritating voice. The plot involves Glen/Glenda (an unashamed Ed Wood reference), the offspring of Chucky (again voiced by Brad Dourif) and Tiffany, tracking down his parents on a real Chucky movie (another example of the film-within-a-film self-aware vibe of 'Seed...') and bringing them back to life. Chucky and Tiffany aim to inhabit the bodies of Tilly and Redman while Glen/Glenda struggles with both his sexuality and whether he wants to kill.Being the Child's Play series, there is plenty of gore, but – like most horror-comedy films – the gore is ridiculous and over-the-top, the highlight being Tiffany carving out Redman's innards under a table. Your opinion of 'Seed of Chucky' will depend on your love of the series: fans of the old-school Child's Play films would abhor the jokiness and lack of seriousness, while others attuned to the horror-comedy genre will appreciate the ridiculous premise and all the in-jokes.",Seed of Chucky
86,ThrownMuse,The best movie in the series.,8,6 June 2007,"I'm a big fan of trashy humor and maybe that's why I dug this one so much. I think that the Chucky series finally became worth watching when the People In Charge realized how stupid the concept of a serial-killing doll was, and decided to milk what they created for its full comedic potential. Bride of Chucky was a witty and well-written resurrection of a lifeless franchise, and Seed is just about as good of a follow-up as can be expected. This time, Chucky creator Don Mancini takes the director's chair, and the result is a distinctly trashy queer installment, chock-full of gross-out humor and doll-sex gags. Jennifer Tilly's comedic timing shines, and she deserves credit for playing a ""lesser"" version of herself. John Waters has a supporting role as a sleazy paparazzo, and there's an homage to Ed Wood in the form of a gender-confused doll. The first time I watched this one I wasn't sure what to think, but the second time around I thought it was a hilarious hoot. Very quotable, too: ""No, I didn't scream. Bound is playing on cable and Gina Gershon is fingering me.""",Seed of Chucky
87,kylehaines96,I Am Chucky The Killer Doll!(*** Out Of ****).,8,14 December 2012,"Her is a movie that falls into the category of movies that I like but everyone else hates. I can understand why some people would say that this movie is not that good but, honestly, I don't understand the utter and pure hatred for the film.The film does start off with an... interesting opening sequence. By interesting I mean that the entire first minute of the movie is a bunch of sperm flying around. Yeah... so anyway, Chucky voiced by Brad Dourif and Tiffany voiced by Jennifer Tilly have a child named Glen voiced by Billy Boyd(Appropriate enough since The Hobbit comes out today). The child does a whole lot of things like wet himself and is hard to determine whether or not he is a...boy...or...girl. Basically he does anything but kill people. Chucky and Tiffany want to take over some souls to be human again. Chucky wants Redman played by Redman and Tiffany, oddly enough, wants Jennifer Tilly played by Jennifer Tilly. They have a problem, Glen/Glenda(Get it?) wants them to stop killing to which Chucky has some problems with.The first and main problem I have is the character of Glen/Glenda. I like the look and voice of the doll, but they completely screwed this character up. A killer doll child would be better than a doll child that WETS HIMSELF 3 TO 4 TIMES IN THE MOVIE! Sorry for shouting, but man thats really absurd. Also he doesn't do a whole lot in the movie. He is just there.The last 2 problems I have with the movie. The first, Redman, what are you doing here? You are not even in the movie for more than 6-7 minutes. You are, Dare I Say, useless in this film. The last is how while the movie is funny it goes a little too far into the comedy realm.The first good thing is of course the voice acting of Brad Dourif, Jennifer Tilly and Billy Boyd. I also like the acting by Redman, who does an o.k job, John Waters and Jennifer Tilly who is HOT! I'm sorry but if you are a male, watch this, and don't find her hot you lose 1000 points in street credibility.Also I do like how they go after two celebrities instead of two people off of the street. Plus even though it goes a little too much on the comedy it is still a funny movie, however I did not need to see Chucky...pleasuring himself.The Final Verdict for Seed Of Chucky is 3 Stars Out Of 4. It has good voice acting, amazing effects, and good acting. This movie is not for everybody but I do recommend it. You will have fun with it if you leave your brain at the door.Did I mention that Jennifer Tilly was hot?

And Chucky dies and tif and that is the worst ending I have seen from this series so all around an enjoyable movie if you don't mind the comedy if u don't watch this but if you do you will enjoy the movie has cool kills so I give Seed of Chucky a C+,Seed of Chucky

Tilly plays a bimbo caricature of herself, who's victimized by the dolls, and king-of-camp Waters appears for a short time as a sleazy paparazzi. Some viewers may take their cue to the exit after the opening with a tasteless computer-animated reproduction sequence; this overly gory, hopefully last installment goes more for self-parody and camp, though fails to inject any of the clever dark energy that worked in Bride in Chucky.

90,zac-04879,Continues to Take The Silly Fun Over The Edge,4,26 October 2021,"Child's Play began as a horror franchise relating to a killer doll targeting a young boy, but 4 films later, Chucky has become a total joke. Don Mancini has written and directed his popular horror villain towards the aspect of darkly unfunny comedy. Although Seed is surprisingly a lot better than Bride, the 'fun' has just completely taken over the horror Chucky.Alike Bride of Chucky, there's sexual content and crude humour. What do you get when you mix sexual content and crude humour? The answer: A doll-baby! This instalment welcomes an uninteresting, unlikeable and an annoying new addition to Chucky's family. The voice-acting can't save the dumb attitude.However, Seed of Chucky does improve with the fun and pace. It's not completely boring and utterly unfunny, despite that it's a stupid and silly horror-comedy meant for nothing to do with serious fans. There's still the gore and surprises, but being a completely seperate film probably would've given it more appreciation. Instead of taking Chucky from the horror genre, which is still creative to give him his own family, why not start with a completely new comedy? Something just like Seed of Chucky, but without using the Child's Play characters.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Seed of Chucky
91,happyendingrocks,"Chucky and Tiffany, please don't have any more kids",1,14 June 2012,"After the rousing boost Bride Of Chucky injected into the sagging Child's Play series, a follow-up that carries forth the same morbidly humorous elements that made Bride such a delight should have been something to get truly excited about. The very existence of Seed Of Chucky seems to suggest that the film-makers finally figured out how much fun Chucky installments could be, and were raring to give fans of the franchise another killer blast of gruesome comedy.Instead, they gave us this.Seed Of Chucky isn't just the worst film in the Child's Play series, it is, in my estimation, possibly the third or fourth worst movie ever made. Sure, severed-tongue-in-cheek is once again the order of the day here, but this time out none of the sophomoric humor is the least bit funny, and instead of building on the momentum of Bride, this useless entry is a tedious and pathetic mess that essentially shoots the franchise in the kneecaps.The selling point for Seed Of Chucky is of course our homicidal hate-birds' unholy offspring, who we would assume has the genetic potential to be one of horror history's most ghastly and villainous creations. However, the result of Chucky and Tiffany's coupling turns out to be Glen/Glenda, a meek and whiny asexual pantywaist with a British accent who looks like a reject from a paint-by-numbers animated Tim Burton film, and spends most of the movie crying and wetting his/her pants before we discover that he/she is actually a schizophrenic cross-dressing psychopath with both mommy and daddy issues. Calling Glen/Glenda a disappointing and lame-o creation is an insult to both disappointment and lameness, and since the titular Seed's story is introduced via a sappy ""where did I come from?"" voice-over narration and computer-generated doll effects lifted straight from a Pixar movie, Seed Of Chucky pretty much stalls right out of the gate.The asinine plot revolves around an in-production Hollywood film about the events in Bride Of Chucky (although, oddly, the one scene we see from this potential cinematic landmark portrays Chucky murdering a guy in a Santa Claus suit at a cemetery). Jennifer Tilly is the star of the obtusely-titled ""Chucky Goes Psycho,"" but she has loftier ambitions: she wants the lead role in a Biblical epic about the Virgin Mary being directed by the rapper Redman. Meanwhile, Glen/Glenda's search for his/her roots has led to the soundstage housing the film production, where he/she finds the mechanical dolls constructed for ""Chucky Goes Psycho,"" which he/she reanimates using the Amulet Of Damballa, thus bringing Chucky and Tiffany back to life and reuniting their dysfunctional family. When their son/daughter is horrified by their homicidal antics, Chucky and Tiffany realize that they are ""addicted to killing"" and decide it's time to kick their habit cold turkey (Tiffany even procures 12-Step program literature to assist them). The recovering junkies also hatch a plot to transfer their souls into the bodies of Redman and Tilly (both playing themselves) to become human again, but since this scheme would leave Glen/Glenda out in the cold, they ascertain that they first have to get Tilly pregnant so that she can give birth to a child for Glen/Glenda to inhabit. By the mid-way point of the movie, when Tiffany artificially inseminates Tilly with a turkey baster full of Chucky's... well, you know... the film officially scrapes the bottom the barrel and never resurfaces.Seed Of Chucky can't even keep the mythos of the franchise straight, and so many previously established rules are skirted that the original bachelor Chucky modality is essentially negated. For one, Glen/Glenda is able to resurrect both of his/her parents by simply reading four words off the back of the Amulet (in Child's Play 3, Chucky grunted the soul-transfer incantation for a full five minutes and still wasn't successful). A peek into Tiffany's back-panel immediately after her awakening reveals that the dolls become ""human"" right away (even though we had previously been repeatedly told that the soul-shifting in the series was a matter of urgency because if Chucky's spirit stayed in the doll too long, he would become flesh and blood and be trapped in the Good Guy guise). Even the physiology of the coitus that initially spawned Glen/Glenda is ultimately rendered questionable when Tilly gives birth (since its a ""voodoo pregnancy,"" Tiffany explains, this occurs only two days after Tilly is impregnated), and Chucky's DNA mixed with a live woman's somehow produces perfectly healthy and normal human children. Then there's the troubling matter of the matching ""Made In Japan"" birthmarks that Glen/Glenda and Chucky share. Not only has Chucky never had this mark in any of the previous Child's Play entries, we've also spent significant portions of the franchise inside the factory where Good Guy dolls are made, which is most assuredly not in Japan. Furthermore, the Chucky doll in this film is a construct of the special effects crew making ""Chucky Goes Psycho,"" remember? The entire point of this glaring gaffe seems to be to set up a climactic kung-fu battle between Glen/Glenda and Chucky, and since this ends up being a strong contender for the dumbest scene in the film, the discrepancy becomes infuriating.On the plus side, Seed is loaded with gore (I'm assuming this is intended to distract you from how unpalatable this tripe is) but since most of the FX are handled via CGI, none of the kill scenes are all that impressive. Worse, Kevin Yagher's brilliant, standard-setting puppetry is replaced here by computer-generated animation, and somehow this ""state of the art"" technology makes the walking, talking dolls look LESS realistic than they ever have before.I know this is a lengthy write-up, but I'm forced to concede that my work here is all in vain. What good is a review when words simply can not express exactly how utterly abysmal this film is?",Seed of Chucky
92,kingofdanerds,Welp...... Here we are.........,3,27 September 2021,"1998's Bride of Chucky changed the tone of the Chucky series by making it a bit more comedic while still retaining elements of horror. The film left on a cliffhanger that would somewhat be returned to with the next film in the franchise, Seed of Chucky. Released in 2004, Seed of Chucky is written and directed by Don Mancini (who makes his directorial debut and has been the series writer since the very beginning) and stars Jennifer Tilly, Redman, Hannah Spearritt, John Waters, Billy Boyd, and Brad Dourif. The film would be a failure with critics and audiences with many consistently ranking this film on the very bottom of Chucky series rankings. This film would prove to be such a failure that this would be the last Chucky film to be released in theaters until the Child's Play remake.Six years after the events of Bride of Chucky, we discover that the offspring of Chucky and Tiffany is overseas and struggling with many questions. They want to know who their parents are and eventually they find out and go to Hollywood where the Chucky and Tiffany dolls are being used as animatronics in a movie based off of the murders. Chucky and Tiffany are brought back and now this family must try and become ""one happy family"".Seed of Chucky is often considered the worst and while I cannot consider it a truly horrendous film (say a one out of ten), Seed of Chucky is still not a good film. Where the previous film saw a perfect balance of both horror and comedy, this film decides to drop the horror and up the comedy and meta references. The comedy itself is mostly a miss but I can get a laugh or two (if the film is fairly lucky, maybe three). I find some of the jokes to be funny when it is making fun of an actual person. For example, jokes made toward/about Jennifer Tilly are actually pretty funny. The film tries to be different with it's story and tone, which I have to give credit for. They at least attempted to do something different. But it still failed. This film also has some of the strangest and down right weird and unnecessary things to ever be included in the film. Things that fans never would have wanted to see in a Chucky film and if they never wanted to see it in a Chucky film, it sure would have been included in some Chucky fan fiction if it has not already. I guess the film is fairly aware of it's complete absurdity and embraces it. But you know what they say, only a face a mother could love. Chucky and Tiffany do return (as to be expected) and this is probably their weakest appearance so far. Chucky is decent still, but no longer scary and no good one liners. Tiffany is just annoying and has lots of motive changes throughout the film. The titular ""Seed of Chucky"" is fairly bizarre. Glen/Glenda is the first instance of a gender fluid character (at least to my memory) in a horror movie and while I think it is nice to know that gender fluid is being represented especially in 2004, it is still not handled fairly well at all. Instead of being serious about it for once, the film decides to make a joke out of it. Plus, it does not really go anywhere in terms of story. To fully represent, you need to have something to say about it. The acting is silly (again, as to be expected) and again, Jennifer Tilly is probably the best in this film (for completely different reasons than in Bride of Chucky). The kills are fairly cool and we get some nice graphic kills here and there. Not the best, but certainly something good to look at. Perhaps because the kills have no effect due to the surroundings of absurdity. Bride of Chucky had great kills because it had balance. This film does not. So, when a kill happens, you will probably just go, eh. Though the special effects are a bit hit and miss. The film uses mostly CGI for the kills but we get a few good practical effects. On the topic of CGI, this film was made in Romania. The film is set in Hollywood. So, for a lot of external shots, they had to use CGI to make it all look realistic. Which it does not. It feels cheap and I do not like it one bit. The ending is somewhat confusing and probably the worst ending so far.Seed of Chucky may not be the worst horror sequel of all time, but it is still bad. But, got to give credit to film for at least embracing it's absurdity.",Seed of Chucky
93,FKDZ,Very enjoyable and amusing improvement over BoC,6,2 October 2020,"So by accident I watched the Curse of Chucky before this one. But during my binge of the Chucky franchise I doubt that it had much influence as Curse of Chucky was quite detached from the ending of the Seed of Chucky.So first of wow, I enjoyed this movie so much more than the two that came before and so far the one that came after. The humor and comedy is great and sure, clichés are here and there and they do some fun mimicking of real family problems. But just because of the whole scenario its in, killer dolls.. it works.So there is a new character in this movie introduced in the final scene of BoC and that's the kid. Honestly from the get-go I liked the character, he was such a polar opposite of the parents and I think going with that sweet british accent was a great choice even if it's kinda far fetched. He provided some interesting questions and added a fun dynamic.Now this movie FINALLY doesn't have a boring plot and lackluster main character. Jennifer Tilly owns this movie. With some fun stabs at herself and good writing. This doesn't say the movie lacks chucky/ the dolls though, they have plenty of screen time and most of it is used really well.The animatronics and puppetry has improved once again. I gotta say having already seen CoC that movie is simply a downgrade with terrible CGI and the godawful looking chucky. There were about two short scenes in SoC that were iffy, didn't look that great but aside from that its really solid.The kills were also a big step up once again. My critique of BoC and CP3 was again that it had lackluster and quite boring kills. For a horror slasher comedy that just doesn't go. This movie has got some great ones though. With tons of blood, gore and just some great scenes. That said, it's not as creative as some scenes in previous movies. But memorable scenes in this movie were definitely Tiffany killing Red and Chucky's death with some fantastic gore.Now about the ending, so Glen got to be an actual human boy and Tiffany is now.. well the human Tiffany. But... that leaves the daughter. You'd think she would be chucky especially as the nanny said she's been acting crazy. But now that I know the next movie doesn't have the kids anymore.. I'm not sure what to think.This movie does have quite a few pop culture references that will never age that well like in any movie but they're not a big deal imo.One thing this movie also ups is the adult comedy, also if I remember correctly the first ever time the franchise has had nudity in the film. So that kinda gives an idea that the title of this movie definitely lives up to the events in it.Some negatives are that again this movie lacks any kind of scary elements or suspense. It tried to do this in Curse but sadly it didn't work out. Also the soundtrack is getting less and less memorable and significant. Good suspenseful movie is important for a slasher/horror and this franchise in general kinda lacks it.So for me 6/10, very enjoyable slasher film with great comedy.",Seed of Chucky

However I found Seed of Chucky tolerable, and if I dare say so, there was a visual art to the movie non-existent in today's more mainstream shows. I can't explain it, and to be fair, don't watch this movie because of the art direction please. This movie involves Chucky and Tiffany's kid who finds his parents in Hollywood. The disturbing twist is the child has a problem that only Ed Wood would understand: is he Glen or Glenda? This leads to some disturbing moments, particularly toward the end. To round it up, the movie sucks, and the horror, if there was any in the series to begin with, is nowhere to be found. I swear the movie almost feels like a television episode but that is a redeeming quality, believe me. Some cameos here and there, but only after some homework did I find them.

I just didn't catch the crappy comedy.

They then go to Jeniffer Tilly's house and start causing havoc as they are ready to transfer their souls into a another two sets of human beings. Glen/Glenda just wants to be a family but his/her parents seem to be out of control.That is the part I loved about the film the most: the family issues, a son/daughter just wants to be a family and Chucky just continuous his homicidal rampage and Tiffany tries her best. A lot of people look at ""Seed of Chucky"" and just say it's a crappy piece of crap that should have never been made. A lot more people should be looking at the family morals and that's the only things (besides the awesome kills) that this film has to offer.

This film id just plain horrible and heres what it's about believe it or not. The film is more of a dysfunctional family film than a genre flick. It boasts some overly ridiculous kills ( john Waters, Brittany Spears) that are some time fillers of the film's half assed ludicrous development. Enetr title character glen/glenda because we don know it's sex it's chiucky and tiffany's kid. And he doesn't like to kill. He tracks down his parents to Hollywood and resurrects them with the ever shortening incantation. There they decide to impregnate Jenifer Tilly and take over some Hollywood star bodies so that they can be human again. The film boasts some creative laugh sequences but all in all it's just plain crud. In others hands the films supposed cleverness may have come across as so but in Mancin's it falls formidably flat and lifeless. All in all seed of chucky is stillborn.

99,boyinflares,A worthy entry in the Child's Play series,7,22 June 2005,"A 5th entry in the Child's Play series was much expected after the ending of the 4th (""Bride of Chucky""). Chucky returns at his baddest (voiced again by the terrific Brad Dourif), and the fantastic Tiffany is back too (voiced by the lovely Jennifer Tilly). Obviously, going by the title of this movie, Chucky's ""seed"" is here also his son/daughter Glen/Glenda. When I learned that this was going to be another horror film which had a horror film within it I was somewhat hesitant, but the film-within-a-film played only a minor part. The puppets were all great, Tiffany in particular, and they certainly made up for the lack of many human characters. Jennifer Tilly is brilliant, playing herself this time (she played the human Tiffany in the 4th). She looks fantastic too. Hannah from S Club does good as Jennifer's personal assistant, Redman is also great, and the guy who plays Jennifer's driver is a bit of a hottie.

The screenwriters couldn't think of a reason so why should I? Anyway, they also have a trans-gender kid (I don't know why, just go with it) and somehow it managed to survive being stranded and alone for who knows how many years. This film is filled with stupid crap like that by the way. The story is about this kid trying to find Chucky and Tiffany and then it becomes the standard Child's Play story: find people to transport their bodies into. Boring, been there done that, but they managed to make it worse than the last four times they used it. I think it had something to do with the fact that at the end if the movie, Chucky decides to stay a doll! Really!? REALLY!? You just wasted so much of my time! I've watched five movies of him trying to become human again and this is what I get? It's disgusting and a terrible decision. There are even more problems if you can believe it, but this movie is making me sick to my stomach so I'm going to stop talking about it.",Seed of Chucky

103,Boggman,God bless you Jennifer.....,8,4 August 2005,"How awesome is Jennifer Tilly?? Well I am about to tell you.Mocking her own celebrity self, persona, and lifestyle while at the same time doing the voice over for Tiffany, the killer wife doll of Chucky; Jennifer Tilly marches through ""Seed of Chucky"" headstrong, confident, and absolutely hilarious.Jennifer turns ""Seed of Chucky"" into one hell of a parody and a good time. How refreshing to see such a talented actress take on a role that she is clearly having fun with, and not taking herself or her career so damn seriously; like most other actresses out there are doing these days.Its a wonderful and wise choice of Jennifer-and ""Seed of Chucky"" will no doubt reach cult status in time to come.This movie has great cameos from Redman and especially John Waters as a crazed papparazzi photographer. The script is absolutely hilarious. The acting is also great as well. Visuals, and gore are also all there--in one nicely wrapped up package.Check this movie out is all I can say. It's a great twist on the Chucky genre and the best of the series since Part 1. I hesitated to watch this movie out of fear that it would just be too dumb. On the contrary, the movie proved to be quite smart and more intelligent than I thought possible.There is so much going on in ""Seed of Chucky"" that I dare not try to summarize the plot in this review.Just go get it...and have yourself some fun! Highly Recommended!",Seed of Chucky
104,rarepeperonis,This movie gets a bad rep,7,19 September 2019,"But i'm sure i'll be a cult classic in the future.
Glen is annoying but the rest of the movie is pretty funny and entertaining with clever and funny gags. This one is a pure comedy don't expect to be scared at all but if you see it in a twited comedy mood you'll get your money's worth",Seed of Chucky
105,timhayes-1,Another horror series takes the comedy route,7,20 June 2005,"Like the Nightmare On Elm Street series before it, the Child's Play films have taken on a very humorous turn. What started out as a very straight forward horror film has over the past four sequels turned into a comedy with gore in it. That's not to say that Seed Of Chucky is a bad film by any means. It's actually really funny. While many compared New Nightmare to the Player for its blending of reality and fantasy, this film actually does it as well but manages to stick more to the satiric humour of The Player. There are Hollywood jokes galore and references to past films. Chucky's Ode to The Shining is pure hilarity and even Jennifer Tilly herself isn't safe as she manages to send up her own image more than even the rest of the cast around her. While Seed of Chucky is enjoyable for what it is, I can only hope that they decide to return the series to its terror roots if another is to be made.",Seed of Chucky

107,richard-wheeler,Dolly will be pleased to know that she has now become an aunt!,8,10 September 2005,"I enjoyed Seed Of Chucky because it was a lot more entertaining than ""Bride Of Chucky"" with Tiffany and Chucky knowing that they are parents, Jennifer Tilly being admired by Tiffany and of course, having an offspring in the family named: ""Glenda"". But do you know what would have given this movie more vibe, the screen writer should have put Dolly Dearest in this because, she is now an aunt, ""Aunt Dolly"". WHAT A PITY that Dolly didn't get a part in this film. SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FREAKIER THAN CHUCKY THAT'S FOR SURE!!!!The movie begins with Glenda (Billy Boyd) being given to a little girl named Claudia ( Bethany Simons Danville) as a Birthday gift and she thought he was ugly so she put Glenda in the cupboard and late at night, he went and attacked the parents ( Simon James Morgan and Stephanie Chambers) and OH! THIS WAS SO FUNNY when Glenda looked in the mirror, he got a fright! And the little girl caught him and told Glenda that he wet his pants. AWW SHAME!The poor little thing! And right before our eyes, it was all just a dream. Glenda wondered why he kept having those dreadful nightmares!Now Glenda was discovered by Psychs ( Keith-Lee Castle) in a cemetery back in L.A when he also discovered the bodies of Chucky and Tiffany. Psychs used Glenda as a puppet in comedy hours. And Glenda was not a killer doll like his mother and father , he is a gentle, warm and loving toy and he can also speak Japanese because he was made in Japan and so was Tiffany.And to my surprise, Glenda was a she-male! BUT GOSH! He was HIDEOUS! I'm sure Dolly would have fainted if she heard her nephew was meek and mild but she would give a demonic squeal of joy if she heard how hideous Glenda was! But one thing that gave me a warm feeling inside was when I noticed that Glenda has a resemblance to his mother. That is so natural. Boys usually do look like their moms and girls usually look like their dads.Anyways, back to the movie. It seems Glenda was stranded in London and when he heard about his parents who were in Hollywood, he decided to make a run for it and got to L.A safely. When he got there, he found his parents and he brought them back to life with a peculiar amulet with writing on the back.The freakiest part in this film was when some dude opened up Tiffany at the back and saw all her insides. Gosh! These dolls have become human! And Tiffany killed him. Glenda was shocked to see who his parents really were, but Tiff has a very soft spot for her child, and she is pleased that she is a mother but Chucky wasn't at all happy that he became a father.And soon, Chucky excepted Glenda as his son and he wanted to teach Glen how to murder people. I was surprised that Chucky could drive because he is so small. Here comes another laugh, Brittany Spears ( Nadia Dina Ariqate) decided to overtake Chucky and she gave him a zap and then Chucky came up to the side of Brit's car and casted her off a cliff and Chucky said: "" Oops! I did it again!"" Soon, Tiffany began to admire Jennifer Tilly because she was so famous so, she, Chucky and Glenda went over to Tilly's place and did a number of murders. The funniest murder was when she stabbed Redman in the stomach and Redman's stomach ran out and landed on the floor. Those stomach guts looked like hot, raw Boerewors ( South African sausage) to me. It's about time we saw Tiffany pick up a knife and stab her victims. She looked so SCARY! Later on in the film, Jennifer Tilly became pregnant and Tiffany helped her out as Jen and her boyfriend were tied to the bed. And CONGRATULATIONS! Jennifer had twins, a boy and a girl. And soon, Tiffany knocked Jennifer out and tried to transfer her soul into her body and suddenly, Chucky appears kills Tiff with an Axe. After that, there was an entertaining action scene with Glenda fighting his father with ninja style and it was ended with Glenda hacking up Chucky with an Axe.A few years later at Glen's birthday party, Jennifer Tilly's housekeeper Fulvia ( Rebecca Snatos) was complaining about the Tiffany doll looking at her because, she found her so intimidating and suddenly, Jennifer bashes Fulvia with the doll , laughs, and her brown eyes change to blue. TIFFANY HAS POSSESSED JENNIFER TILLY!!!Well, everything looks back to normal because everyone is human and that includes Glenda. Glenda became a boy named Glen ( Beans El-Balawi) and a girl named Glenda ( Kristina Hewitt). It seems Glenda possessed the twin babies. And to end the film, Glen got a birthday gift and when he opened it, Chucky's arm shot out! That was pretty freaky! Seed of Chucky was a fun movie and it sure did keep me entertained for an hour and a half at the cinema but as for my sister Alex, she found it so bad that she asked me for the movie ticket because she wanted to go out have a smoke. Oh well! My sister is like that when it comes to killer doll film because it's not her genre. I was shocked to see that there were only eleven people including my sister and I watching this film. I am telling you all, it's a REAL FUN movie! And I wonder what Dolly would have looked like if she transfered herself into a person's body?????????",Seed of Chucky
108,psi_fla,Okay,6,28 May 2005,"In Seed Of Chucky, we join Chucky the talking, slashing doll (voiced by Brad Dourif) for the fifth time. The seed in question has led to him producing an offspring with female slasher doll Tiffany (voiced by Jennifer Tilly). Offspring (voiced by Billy Boyd) stows away aboard an aircraft and jets to Hollywood to find Father and Mother. A thin narrative follows involving Jennifer Tilly (playing herself) trying to get a part in a film at all costs. This is merely a crutch for a series of sly film and pop culture references, not-very-scary horror sequences, and a series of very funny moments.Seed Of Chucky isn't a particular frightening slasher film. But it is still entertaining - in fact, I'd go as far as saying it's among the best in the recent crop of repetitive, cheap horror flicks. It has a tone very reminiscent of Team America: World Police (which is very welcome), but has neither as sharp an edge nor as broad a scope. This means that it will be more quickly forgotten; for all the fun to be had from watching Seed Of Chucky, there is really very little to it. Nevertheless, it's a good excuse for a time-passer. There's nothing pretentious about it. If you sit down and relax, you're definitely guaranteed some entertainment value. Better this than the likes of Ocean's Twelve and Be Cool.Rating: 6/10",Seed of Chucky
109,fritzlang,Another underrated classic!,9,11 December 2004,"From all the negative reviews I have read, it seems to me that people just cannot handle satire and/or horror icons in comedy. This is not - repeat - NOT a horror film. Not a second of it was scary, nor was it meant to be. If people are hating this film because it wasn't scary then they went to see the wrong film.This is a hilarious gore-comedy that had me laughing in stitches for almost the entire length of the film.The films satires/homage to Psycho, The Shining, Halloween, AA, Britney Spears, and of course Ed Wood - with tons of blood and carnage.Personally, this film wildly exceeded my expectations and I have rarely laughed so hard for so long. and yes, these comedic moments were intentional. The film starts out with a gory murder and never lets up till the last frame.Jennifer Tilly should get an award for having the guts to both play and make fun of herself in a film. I am not aware of any other actress who would have to courage to make fun of their weight problem in such a clever way.The director (first time, BTW) did an outstanding job with just a low budget.While I enjoyed Glen, I am looking forward to the sequel. Yes - bring it on! So if you are in a mood to laugh at what admittedly is a very silly gory film, this is highly recommended.",Seed of Chucky
110,TheMichaelMyersMovieFanatic,Now there's 3 of them! - Horror Reviews,3,16 November 2019,"Chucky and Tiffany has a son that ressurects them after the ending of ""Bride of Chucky"", but soon the family consequenses arrive.Review: I honestly don't know what to say about this. They for some reason took inspiration from Halloween: Ressurection (aka the most hated Halloween movie of all time), and made a movie existing to take a dig on the franchise. Glen/Glenda is both wierd and unwatchable anad Tiffany looses the charm that she had in ""Bride of Chucky"". Jennifer Tilly returns to play both the demonic doll and herself (this ended up being one of my biggest problems with the film). There's an completely unnecessary plot line of a driver being in love with a character and that he doesn't dare telling her the truth. Of course the legendary Brad Dourif returns to play Chucky, but he doesn't get the appreciation in this movie that he deserves. The kills here are not the best either. But if I would have to write down any positives in this movie, I would say that it would be Chucky. There's enjoyment to be had in a few scenes, but I would rather watch ""Halloween Ressurection"" before this one.Final: ""Seed of Chucky"" is not a good film, there's nothing in this movie that you need to know when watching the 2013 sequel. So do yourself a favour and skip this one. 2/10.Sorry for misspelling some stuff...",Seed of Chucky
111,eched,"Might just be the worst Child's Play, but it's still good fun",6,4 June 2005,"I had kind of high hopes for this film. The two main reasons were that Bride was such a great slam dunk of a film. The man that directed it, Ronny Yu, is pretty much on my A list of fave directors because of what he did with that film, not to mention what he did with Freddy Vs Jason. The second reason was the man that was making this was the man that wrote all the other Child's Plays so I thought, if anyone could do Chucky right, he could. But sadly, I was disappointed. Now, I'm sure I'll grow to love this film over time. It was a good laugh after all. It's just the plot was to cheesy, even for me, and I'm kind of obsessed with the cheese. That and Glen came off as a guy. Okay, that's not really a bad point because the guy that did him did a pretty good job and Glen is kind of odd, but likable. It just strikes you as odd when people are mistaking him for a girl when he sounds so much like a guy. Then again the run Glenda run line made me laugh pretty hard. Also, I guess I was disappointed because it just didn't top Bride in the look department. Bride was just so good visual wise and this just didn't measure up. Well, it was still worth my time and fans will get a kick out of it. If you got some time check it out. They should have just rethought the plot. 7 out of 10.",Seed of Chucky
112,czarnobog,Top Notch Entertainment Transcends The Genre,10,27 May 2006,"Wow! I've always enjoyed the Chuckie series but found it clever at best. This sequel stands out -- way beyond the rest of the series. From top to bottom it's packed with nuanced performances (even from the dolls!) and perfectly executed humor (thankfully not the cheesy clunky one-liner humor which reduces so many horror films to dreck).In the hands of writer-director Don Mancini, Chuckie, his bride and their offspring come to life as full-blown, multidimensional characters. The puppetry is pure genius. To be honest, I never paid as much attention to the subtle details of the puppet's facial features in previous entries to the series. After watching this one, I went back and watched it again, trying to figure out why the puppets seemed so alive.Brad Dourif's delivery of Chuckie's lines is delightful. Chuckie has matured into a blasé and unapologetic psychopath, with a Danny DeVito snarl. His twisted bride Tiffany conveys complex emotions with subtle curls of her lips, or sidelong glances. Their offspring is at least as lively, conveying menace and vulnerability concurrently, through ingenious design of his features.All of this is heightened by Mancini's very capable direction. Although filmed in Romania, the sets are believable renditions of typical Hollywood locations. The action is cleverly staged. Mancini takes full advantage of his writer-director capabilities, as noted in the scenes involving phone calls, where the action feeds off the dialog for enhanced comedic and dramatic effect.I had seen Bride of Chucky and found it enjoyable, but it didn't blow me away like Seed. Luckily it is on again this week and I will make a point to catch it, to see if I underestimated it. What is puzzling, and not a little sad, is that Don Mancini, who created such a successful franchise and wrote all of the Chuckie movies, had to wait two decades for a chance to direct one -- seven years after a Chinese director who had only done Chinese films was given the reins of ""Bride."" At least one reviewer here downgraded this film and complained that it didn't scare him enough. I can see how someone expecting to be scared by a doll in a tongue-in-cheek movie sequel might be of the mentality not to appreciate the incredible skills of all parties connected to this movie. It is certainly less of a horror film than ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""The Exorcist."" But it is in the same vein as Peter Jackson's early comedic ""horror"" films. The kind of less scary but highly entertaining film that will appeal to mainstream audiences, as well as a large segment of the horror crowd. Hopefully, Mancini will now get the sort of opportunities given to Jackson. There is more directing talent demonstrated in this movie than in all the movies directed by the other Chucky directors, except maybe for Tom Holland's ""The Temp."" (No, I am NOT Mancini's agent, and have never met the man. I just appreciate great film-making and am eager to see what Mancini serves up next.)",Seed of Chucky
113,Horror_Fan01,"Funny, Scary, The Best Of The Series!",8,25 February 2007,"In the style of ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" and ""Scream 3,"" the fifth film about killer doll Chucky involves a movie within the movie about the exploits of the famous maniac. Naturally, it isn't long before the prop versions of Chucky (voice of Brad Dourif) and Tiffany (voice of Jennifer Tilly, who also costars as herself) become possessed by the spirits of the originals, for reasons that no-one bothers to explain in detail because they really don't matter. Meanwhile, Chucky and Tiffany's gender-ambiguous child from ""Bride of Chucky"" (now voiced by ex-Hobbit Billy Boyd) has grown up in England, and become part of a heavy-metal ventriloquist act known as ""Psych and Shitface."" Escaping to Los Angeles to meet his parents, the former dummy, in a tribute to Ed Wood, has trouble deciding whether he wants to be named Glen or Glenda. But what he does know is that he doesn't want to be a killer, a fact that disgusts his father and induces his mother to try and quit killing using a 12-step program. All the while, the real Jennifer Tilly is auditioning to play the part of the virgin Mary in a film to be directed by rapper Redman (himself). Plans for that are stymied when Chucky decides that he needs to artificially inseminate her and transfer Glen/Glenda's spirit into a real baby. Oh, and a stalkerazzo played by John Waters is hot on everyone's trail. Needless to say, none of this is intended to be taken seriously. One or two kills are pretty cool, but overall the low budget hurts the film -- most of it is set in Jennifer Tilly's house. The epilogue features the only decent scare, which is a shame; Chucky is inherently funny, but we like him to occasionally be frightening too.Overall, Definitely Worth The Rent, Espiecally If Your A Fan Of The Previous Sequels!",Seed of Chucky
114,sadie_thompson,"Yeah, it's dumb, but so what?",7,22 August 2005,"First off, I've never seen a Chucky movie before this one. The only contact I had with the series period was wondering how the hell Ronny Yu went from ""Bride with White Hair"" to ""Bride of Chucky."" That's quite a leap. For some reason, though, I felt strangely compelled to see this movie. Not just to see it, but also to pay twenty bucks for it. I don't regret it.I think this movie's main flaw is a lack of consistency. Yeah, I know it's a puppet slasher movie, but consistency would still be helpful. For instance, the first part of the movie features an hilarious, slutty, fame-hungry Jennifer Tilly. I think the first 20 minutes of the movie feature some damned funny moments, from the isn't-the-fake-head-realistic scene to her awful portrayal of the Virgin Mary. The movie stays funny for a good while, and you might even laugh at the whole turkey baster thing. Then the Jennifer Tilly character goes veering off in another direction--from MTV-award worthy to Oscar-worthy, and the change hurts the movie. I think it does, at least. I went from laughing to major discomfort and it only took two seconds. The painfully shallow Jennifer became the desperate Jennifer, a woman who only wants her children to be safe. It's fine to have more than one genre in a movie, but make the transition a little smoother, hmm? It's like skateboarding into a wall--really fun, and then painfully and abruptly not fun at all. Even her screaming isn't funny in this part of the movie. It's terrified and anguished; before it was just silly. To make matters worse, by the last 15 minutes of the movie, she's another Jennifer entirely. A green-eyed, Tiffany-toting weirdo with two weirdo kids. So, all told, this movie has four Jennifer Tillys. (Gina Gershon would be thrilled, wouldn't she?) However, I would definitely watch this again (as well I should, since I paid for the thing) just to watch Jennifer Tilly be idiotic. Her performance is admirable, from the shameless putdowns to the blatant ass-kissing. Who else but Tiffany would think Jennifer has the voice of an angel? One of the best scenes in the movie occurs when Jennifer, her assistant Joan, and Tiffany are all on the phone. Tiffany is eavesdropping on another extension when she decides to participate in the conversation. This causes some great confusion--""Why are saying these things, Jennifer?"" ""I'm not saying anything! Why are you making fun of me? I don't sound like that!!!"" And it goes on for what seems like years, so the laughs go on and on. Then you're laughing until someone gets eviscerated and the movie hurtles off in another direction. Oh well.Big acting kudos to little Glen also. It's sad to say, but Glen is the most expressive actor I've seen in a long time, and he's plastic. It's rather difficult to watch--I had to keep reminding myself he was a puppet. He's that impressive. He needs to get over the pants-wetting though, because that got real old real quick. (Freaky colored-urine, too, he may need a checkup.) Chucky was realistic enough, and Tiffany looks like a trailer park nightmare on crack. No big deal though, because she knows she has a problem and she's trying to overcome it! I was also glad to see John Waters being tacky as always. I watched his departure scene and thought, ""Hey, they're burning the trash! Tee hee!"" But he is great, and he gets the best line in the movie--""A masturbating midget?"" Aptly put, Mr. Waters.Great entertainment value in this, so I definitely recommend it to anyone with 100 minutes to waste. And, to give you more bang for you buck,the DVD has a commentary track, for those of you eager to hear the voice of an angel...of sorts.",Seed of Chucky

I guess I was just looking to have a little fun. Granted it wasn't the most brilliant movies in terms of plot, but I went to see Chucky and have a good laugh- and that's where it delivered.I guess the plot is the only thing that good be improved on. The movie felt a bit rushed for one, and therefore where some continuing scenes put together which didn't make a whole lot of sense. There also weren't that many horror elements to it, and compared to the Bride it was even less scary. Chucky doesn't kill that many people and the whole kung fu scene in the end was a little lame, as was some of the CG animation.Overall, I realize this wasn't a movie for everyone, but overall it was enjoyable and worth seeing at least once .",Seed of Chucky

It is basically a comedy with graphic violence in it (in my opinion anyway) It is actually very underrated, unlike the disappointing Bride Of Chucky. This one is more absurd and silly, but is still a very funny, creepy, and gruesome comedy. Brad Dourif keeps up the great work as the voice of Chucky, and the others do a great job too.

I thought he was going to be stupid at first, but i was wrong again. Chucky was only in this movie for 30 mins. But, that didn't worry me at all. The other characters were interesting as well. No bad characters. just about everything you could ask for. Don Mancini did a great job at directing this movie. This film had everything you could ask for. Glen was a very lovable character. Tiffany came back into it again. And Of course, Chucky! It had great actors in it. Jeniffer Tilly really helped this movie along with this movie. She plays a great part. And Introducing Billy Boyd. He played a great character. And Brad Dourif returns as Chucky again! This film is definitely for the Chucky fans. If you are not a Chucky fan, then you should not watch this film under any circumstances. This movie also had hilarious bits in it. Such as Britney Spears getting rammed off a cliff.

He find's them on a movie set of Chucky Goes Psycho and somehow brings them back to life with the amulet Chucky used in the other movies. Glen is so glad to see his, parents. Only problem is he hates it when they Kill people. Unlike Chucky Glen is a nice guy at heart and very caring. By the way Billy Boyd did a fantastic job with Glen. I hope he does more voice work in the future Chucky series. Glen turned out to be a great addition to the Chucky series. His looks and charm will make you want to take him home.Now Tiffany she's same old Martha Stewart girl she was from before. Perfect and still bad to the bone. The entire movie is hilarious, it's not scary at all. I know a lot of people didn't seem to like the movie, but I enjoyed it. Lot's of action, great voice work! Brad Douriff and Jennifer Tilly really bring Chucky & Tiffany to life. Don Mancini's new look for the dolls turned out good! Best of All is the comedy in the movie.

I do think that Glen/Glenda was very much like his/her parents(both a girl+boy combined into one,weird)but I was afraid when the parents were awakened by their kid. But the thing that surprised me was that Jennifer Tilly was involved in all of this mess(possession of body, murders, surrogate mother, etc.) especially at her home! I had laughed so much at the scene where Chucky ran Britney Spears off the road that I fell out of my seat(then chucky quoted ""Opps, I did it again""). But at the ending scene(hospital scene and his death) I was terrified at what Glen had done to avenge his mother's death. But I was scared when chucky's last words were(""attay-boy, I am proud of you my son..."") then Glen chopped off his head.

Anyway, it is fun, glen/glenda is so cute and hilarious, Billy Boyd was the perfect choice for him, his accent makes glen so unique and funny, and I love to hear him talk; and is such a delight to watch the dolls', especially tiffany's and glen's facial expressions, it's just so funny.

Chucky and his wife Tiffany had a child (yes, they are dolls that breed) who is in England being touted as a ventriloquist dummy, when he is really ""alive"". The guy who uses him as a dummy is an angry fellow that wants the dummy (his name is Shitface) to be mean. S-Face though, is actually quite nice and manages to escape. He flys to Hollywood to find his parents, he saw them on TV so knew where to look. When he meets his parents the poor thing becomes gender-confused as he has no bits. Chucky wants a boy so calls him Glen, Tiffany wants a girl so calls his Glenda. Glen/da doesn't seem to mind and is happy being both.

She demonstrates unbelievable courage and sense of humor by playing herself in the movie which is just a big joke about her. She also delivers her usual more than decent performance, since comedy is her natural gerne. Other members of the cast also do a good job, especially Redman, since he also got a chance to play himself. The plot is fair enough for a movie parodying a horror movie, so all the blood and deaths don't actually scare anyone. Some humor is also in place, most of which deals with Tilly's appearance. So, to sum up, a very good satire, a decent comedy, and a great performance of Jennifer Tilly - all in one.",Seed of Chucky

124,mrphantasm,Summary: Non-predictable and interesting sequel.,10,20 February 2005,"Who could foresee some years ago that Chucky could have such an extended franchise like this one? He became an icon of modern horror (the word modern referring to the period started in the early 80s). He has won his place along Freddy Kruegger, Jason or Michael Myers, but after many years of recess he had the fortune of had a talented screenwriter such as Don Mancini who always had faith in the potential of the concept of the killer doll.Mancini reinvented the franchise of Chucky in the previous effort 'The Bride of Chucky' he added humor to the mix and then Chucky got new life. Seed of Chucky takes place some years after the events told in the aforementioned 'Bride' It can't be said that 'Seed' is a predictable horror piece. As the movie goes on (delivering some unforgettable jokes), the personalities of the dolls take unexpected directions. The ending will surprise even the loyal followers of Child's Play saga.The director has the opportunity of create the most delirious story of Chucky to these days, and he also pay homage to some of his favorite films. Psycho, Glen or Glenda and the films of John Waters (he has a secondary but nice role here) are admired by Mancini and he shows here how much he loves them and respects them. Seed of Chucky not only delivers the necessary amount of blood, scares and laughs, also give us some criticism on Hollywood's trends. The rapper Redman is the tool to make fun of that annoying trend of rapper-actors; even Jennifer Tilly makes fun of herself! And there's more. But the most important is that Chucky still is the star, he has the same charm that makes us adore him.Film Editing, Cinematography and incidental music are superb, this is a good gesture towards the audience, they pay good money for a movie ticket and they deserve a work well done. This is not the case where creators just exploit the strong points of the sequel and forget about other aspects involved in film-making.",Seed of Chucky

Through the times I got to know the unwritten rules of horror flicks rather well and as times progressed from the 80's to the 90's more and more franchises came. Especially franchises are bound by these unwritten rules and their own logic that has been set up by the first film. We all know freddy , jason , Micheal and all the other friends will never die and will come back sooner or later for a new episode.The only thing that will get them down is when you kill the character or the logic that drives the main character. In this part - I hope the very last part- in the child's play series the makers did just that. They made Chucky and all that surrounds him a joke and they made the people that watch the movie feel like morons for doing so. Jennifer Tilly - once promising in bound - haha even that title is driven into the ground- completely humiliates herself in this part and with an air around her that has to resemble the last people on the titanic - damn guys no more lifeboats left- she wiggles through the film.It is sad to see a once entertaining franchise getting this treatment, everything is wrong with this film on a level I have seldom seen- compared to this alone in the dark is a masterpiece-. The inside jokes about the film industry don't work, the humor isn't funny, the rapper that is in there - is this a Steven seagal flick? Oh no it is even worse-the fx which look cheap.. where does it end.Hopefully with this part, Jennifer , Chuck .. you both deserve a hell of a lot better that this character murder.Avoid if you have any love for this series at all!And why did I add the spoiler warning... oh yes because it spoils your evening.. that is why.",Seed of Chucky

One question to the makers of this movie: Why? Seed Of Chucky might be the most disappointing sequel in the history of horror films. It relies on gore, crude sexual humor and moments of nudity to bring laughs. Jennifer Tilly is excellent as both Tiffany and herself, but at times Tiffany is unfunny and annoying. Billy Boyd is OK as Glen/Glenda, but near the end of the movie, his character turns weird and confusing. And where has the originality and freshness of Chucky gone?

130,davidkennedy-91087,Chucky Embraces His Comedic Side,7,26 August 2019,"It must be hard to keep a franchise fresh, but Don Mancini has been constantly reinventing the Child's Play franchise since day one and taking it into interesting directions. Some pit stops have been better than others, but you can't ever accuse Mancini of phoning it in. With the last detour, Bride of Chucky, we saw Mancini fully embrace the comic aspect of a killer doll running around and killing people while still keeping the dramatic stakes high and giving us some great suspense set pieces and kill scenes (who could forget poor John Ritter getting a face full of nails?). With Seed of Chucky, he steps into the director's chair for the first time and decides to completely throw away realism or any shred of true horror and camps it up with mixed results.Seed of Chucky finds Chucky and Tiffany's baby, Glen/Glenda, as a sideshow attraction. He sees his parents on TV being interviewed on the set of a new Hollywood film and escapes to find them. He ends up bringing them back to life and they now want to be a real family, so they decide to inhabit the bodies of the film's star, Jennifer Tilly (who appears to be having the time of her life sending up herself and Hollywood) and rapper turned Bible epic filmmaker, Redman. To get a human body for Glen/Glenda, they must impregnate Tilly.There's not a moment of Seed of Chucky that doesn't feel completely ridiculous, but Mancini keeps the pacing remarkably tight (it's not even 90 minutes) and captures just the right tone throughout. A cameo by John Water as a sleazy paparazzi photographer pretty much tells you everything you need to know about what Mancini is going for. Some jokes land better than others, but even the ones that don't have you on the floor are at least worth a smile or chuckle. Horror fans might be upset that there's a complete lack of horror here, but the open minded among us will find a lot to be entertained by.",Seed of Chucky

134,thefilmguy7,Truly one of the worst,2,9 February 2019,"I can say with full confidence that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm reading that Don Mancini, the creator of this series, is worried how the new reboot Child's Play could negatively affect his universe of Chucky. All I'm thinking is, if you can survive Seed Of Chucky then I think you're safe. This movie was really bad and not in the fun way. It was painful, especially because he's kept it as part of continuity moving into future sequels. It doesn't fit at all. It pretty much killed the franchise. Like how do you move forward with darker edgier stories after seeing this crap? I know that Chucky has always had humor but this took it so far that it made the series into a total joke. It had more in common with Scary Movie than Child's Play. So many stupid, cringe moments. The jokes weren't even funny. Seed also tossed away the series own rules about how Chucky is resurrected. I credit Mancini for his creation and obviously he's put a lot of work into this series. I grew up on the first three movies so i feel bad trashing his later entries so much. This one just kind of ruins everything that I liked about the earlier films. I'm usually not a fan of remakes but part of me is interested to see a new continuity with out the baggage of some of the crazier mistakes in this series.",Seed of Chucky

As for plot and story - heck, the whole series has but one plot but the last two episodes have been very tongue-in-cheek. By now, Chucky has more stitches than a Hollywood star!

This movie was nothing more than an absolute cash grab. The story is capital B-A-D. Everything the prior films had reinforced about how you had to have the actual doll Chucky was in to bring him back, thrown out the window. Anything seems to go now, and your guess about what's going on is truly as good as the next person. Why all the ""what's what"" about the actual story was thrown out the window for this film and made fun of was beyond me. I understand how the film laughs at itself and makes fun of the fact that it's all about a killing doll, but even then with how this film carries itself it's almost as if the writer gave up, the director didn't give a damn, and everyone just wanted a paycheck. The only reason someone should watch this movie (besides the fact they simply want to) is if they're high off their ass with plenty more loaded bowls ready to go, because you'd have to be high to think this film is a true gem. Tiffany and Chucky are as good as ever, but it's a shame this movie had nothing to offer to the franchise besides characters we will never see again.",Seed of Chucky

Eventually the lack of a captivating story or interesting characters not made of plastic will get to you and all that you will be left will be some very impressive death scenes and some third-grade level humor to soften the blow.I think what hurts this film the most is how it fails to live up to the previous sequel, Bride of Chucky. What worked so well in that movie seems like more of the same (yet not quite as good) in this outing.With all that said, Seed of Chucky is still worth that late night rental just to get it out of your system.

141,jason06-1,Entertaining and Watchable,8,13 April 2007,"Seed of Chucky is one of the best in the series*SPOLIERS AHEAD*Plot: Glen/Glenda (Billy Boyd) reawakens his parents. The murderous Chucky (Brad Dourif) and his wife Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) on the set of the new movie, Chucky Goes Psycho. They quickly go about their murderous ways much to the dismay of Glen/Glenda who wants them to stop killing. They agree, but Chucky secretly keeps on killing. On the movie set they run into Jennifer Tilly (Jennifer Tilly) who is in talks with Redman (Redman) about starring in his upcoming film. Chucky plans to posses Redman, Tiffany plans to posses Jennifer Tilly, and Glen/Glenda will posses a new born baby in order to become human again once and for all.The Good News: This is the most comedic of the series. There are plenty of laughs and smiles for the fans in here. The change from horror to comedy didn't bother me as most of the jokes are pretty funny including one about violins, but the change may upset people who are not fond of the comedic Chucky. The plot is fresh and hasn't been done before which is not typical for a fourth sequel. The film builds cleverly on from the fourth with Chucky and Tiffany being together to this outing with their child. The idea that he is not like his parents and their murderous attitude is original and how he wants them to stop killing provides for some hilarious conversations between Tiffany and Chucky. The few kills are nicely handled, we get an acid burning, run off the road, head concussion, lit on fire, and a nice gutting. This brings up the gore in the film. It is pleasantly gory with adequate blood in every killing which is certain to please gore hounds looking for a gory good time. Jennifer Tilly is the best thing here playing a very contrived version of herself. Brad Dourif's voice for Chucky hasn't lost its touch and is still the best and it would be hard to find another voice actor to even match Brad. Redman and John Waters do fine in their roles, but the best supporting actor award goes to Hannah Spearitt as Joan. Hannah's charm and quirk makes her instantly likable and you are saddened to see her go. On the other hand her death was one of the best. I also give props to the script as it makes you start to feel sympathy for Tiffany as she tries to put her murderous instincts behind her and her caring attitude to Glen/Glenda who is also a nice character and you can relate to him. Billy Boyd's voice could've been improved, but it still works well. Once again the dolls move so fluently and realistically that is easy to forget that they are just dolls. So much care is put into the dolls from the movements to the design of them and it shows greatly. The film has good entertainment value and has a good re watch ability factor.The Bad News: There are already people who will be against this because of the comedy. Even though this is mainly comedy it does try to have suspenseful moments, but it feels out of place compared to the rest of the movie and the suspense doesn't sell. The cast needed to be beefed up for a bigger body count as more than a few deaths are a dream or not real. This does contain the clichéd film within a film, but not too much time is focused on that and really doesn't hurt the film. Jennifer Tilly really needed to be more active during the ending and had a real one on two fight with Chucky and Tiffany, but the ending is strong enough to work just fine the way it is right now.Conclusion: Slasher fans who like comedy with their slashing will want to give this a look and for Chucky fans who aren't to picky about the content in their films this is a safe bet, but if you're not a fan of smart Aleck Chucky use caution.

The jokes come thick and fast just as they did in the superior Bride of Chucky but that hardly compensates for the lack of deaths and gore that horror movies should be full of. The best death in the film is when Tiffany disembowels the irritating and big headed Redman (YEAH!). The idea of making Chucky and Tiffany's offspring a ""good guy"" was genius fuelling many arguments between the demented parents.

In a nutshell, Chucky and Tiffany had a kid somewhere in the franchise (Only ever saw this one and the first), he ends up in London somehow, sees the ""Chucky Goes Psycho"" movie being filmed, on some Access Hollywood show, and he sets out to Hollywood to find his parents. Glen (Or Glenda, in a lame Ed Wood joke) doesn't want to kill, but his dad wants him to, and his mom tries to quit killing for their ""daughter"" (she thinks Glen is a girl, hence the Glen or Glenda joke) A word about the special effects: For them to be called ""Special Effects"" they FIRST have to be special. The real gory deaths in the film are quite obviously CGI, and consequently lose any shock value they may have had.I have to say that it was nice to see John Waters in a cameo, but he was wasted in this film.And the ending...

Redman was very good but he isn't in the movie that much. Chucky was great! He had some very funny lines and Tiffany may i say had the best lines in the movie(I couldn't stop laughing in the ""im going to have a slip"" scene)she made me laugh a lot! and Glen/Glenda or whatever was very funny too (all about that scene where he dresses as Tiffany, i almost had a heart attack!). I love every joke in it (my favorites being the Martha Stewart being executed, till the Britney Spears one). I loved the homages of Psycho and The shinning. It was all very funny! I didn't like that the movie basically loses the scare factor and doesn't even try to make some suspense or scare you and the ending was really awful, it felt rushed to me.

His line ""Wanna play?"" is legendary. The first movie was well made and had suspense all over. I loved it.I loved part 2 even more. I know it was ""more of the same"" but that did not matter as I loved Chucky so much. Part 3 was different enough to make it fun.Then things went bad with Bride Of Chucky which was more of a comedy than a real horror movie. I still liked that move though.This however I cannot like at all. The basic story is pathetic. Chucky's son (who did indeed fell off an ugly tree while hitting every branch on it) wants to meet his folks to brings them back to life.That in itself is not so bad but then the story gets really bad as nothing really happens. They do a bit of killing but that is not suspenseful at all.Granted, it has a few really good jokes such as Chucky commenting ""Ooops, I did it again."" after killing Britney. But that is all about it actually.The ending was rather bad as well though it did have one good side. It meant that the movie was over. I own the whole collection of Chucky movies on DVD so I ""have"" to get this one to complete the set but I will wait for it to be on sale.I think the producers should just forget Bride Of Chucky and Seed Of Chucky were ever made and make Child's Play 4 with Chucky as he was meant to be.How to bring him back? Well I doubt that would matter much. The fans would be so happy the real Chucky is back that they would not care how he was brought back.This movie is one that you should try to avoid.

149,TSFive,One of the worst movies I've ever seen...,2,27 August 2006,"The Child's Play films used to be really entertaining. They had no idea they were working under a goofy concept, so they were made under the mentality that what they were conveying was REALLY scary. And, you know, sometimes it was. But at the same time, it was funny because they were expected to be taken SO seriously. And because of this, all three are really pretty entertaining.Then Bride of Chucky came along. When films start to poke fun at themselves, that's when it goes downhill. Bride of Chucky had a little of the mentality of the original three left, but for the most part, it too was a self-critical joke. And here comes Seed of Chucky, full of that. Sadly, the dolls can't carry the films themselves. The whole Andy concept was pretty entertaining, even his attempts to help someone else who has taken his place in Child's Play 3. All that's gone and replaced with dysfunctional family send-ups and pretty lame Jennifer Tilly jokes. And then there's the attempts at horror, which I won't even get into. I'd definitely say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and sadly at that, because I really liked the Child's Play films. It seems that those days are long gone...",Seed of Chucky

I'm a huge horror fan. I love this rubbish. As you all probably know by now, Seed of Chucky is Not a scary movie, its camp horror, which I also like. There was a lot about this I liked, and a lot I didn't. I'll start with likes. It's very funny. Jennifer Tilly was very funny. Second off, Brad Dourif is still the man. For any fan of the series, its always great to hear his oneliners and hear him swear. Someing about potty mouths on dolls just appeals to me. Also, there was a lot of blood and gore in the select scenes with blood and gore. But that leads me to what i don't like about this movie. There wasn't a whole lot of death going around. Honestly, about five people bite it in this movie. Chucky is the supernaturally possessed doll of a serial killer, but really, he doesn't kill anyone and it makes me very mad. Another thing i didn't like about this movie is the fact that the Glen/Glenda doll exists in the first place. I couldn't stand his voice, and he/shes a wimp. Could of done without him. I hope the next Chucky movie is about him killing nonstop. Make him scary again.

It was ok but I rarely watch sequels until folks tell me that's as good as Aliens or T2. I Haven't heard anything near to it about CP2 or CP3 or Chucky's Bride so this afternoon when I was on lockdown in an Asian country, bored as hell, and this movie showed up to my HBO channel, I expected the worst of it and was frankly considering ending my life right after that.
Chucky (5) saved my life. The movie is terrible, and I'm frankly ashamed of me putting a 6 stars on it, but it was also funny as hell. Full of one-liners, full of references for movie buffers (the ""you know, I can't think of a thing to say"" just KILLED me), I kept being OMG-or rather WT- all along. Didn't see time running, even for a quite short movie like that (88 min).
I think I loved it. Actually, from the moment I saw John Waters, I should have known it would be entertaining.",Seed of Chucky
152,snafflemonkey,Good film but the series has long left the horror genre,8,15 November 2005,Seed of Chucky is a hard film to judge really - The film is really enjoyable and as a very black comedy it works very well. As a horror this film fails however that can be said for all the films after the original and perhaps part 2 - there is only so long that you can take this killer doll seriously.The acting is this film is surprisingly good and Jennifer Tilly is as hot and likable as always. The story moves along well and there isn't really a dull moment. In some parts the film looks cheap but it never detracts from the enjoyment.I was very wary going into this film given how much I enjoyed the wonderful Bride of Chucky but thankfully this turned out to be almost as entertaining.,Seed of Chucky

The two dolls spring back to action and kill anyone who stands in their way of becoming a real, human family again.Jennifer Tilly is a wonderful sport about a lot of the jokes at her expense and the film is playful and stylized which might upset fans expecting a darker and scarier film. This one seems most comfortable playing in the old Hollywood melodrama sandbox and it's a refreshing addition to the Child's Play franchise which continues to evolve and try different things with each entry.",Seed of Chucky

Well, there's a reason why I like this film; Watch this movie with a buddy, and enjoy the gore, mayhem, and humor. I watched it first alone, and I said to myself, ""Well, it was alright."" A week later, I watched it again with a friend, and it seemed like a different movie. Definitely, one of the funniest scenes was the infamous ""Glen or Glenda?"" scene about 10-20 minutes in. Chucky and Tiffany try to figure out the gender of Glen/Glenda, when they realize, he has no...let's say, specifications.

Tiffany and Glen's incessant yelling and nagging. Tiffany had no edge in this movie, she's not who she once was.And it's way too gross. In fact the movie spends more time, and I believe Tiffany gets more lines that you have to wonder why they even called this a Chucky movie.The only thing I can say is the soundtrack was good and the cinematography was good. But the script the story, the characters, all of that was pure trash. It wasn't funny, Don. It's just not. It's just camp, uninteresting, unscary and boring.

(or family).Chucky franchise stop trying to be the horror saga that it was meant to be, and since Bride of Chucky they decided to write comedies with some gore, instead of making a mess like Jason X or Freddy vs. Jason, etc. And made something just plain bad, they made a fun and wit film that all the time is making fun of itself.Totally a guilty pleasure and a Sunday afternoon movie, but completely enjoyable.If you see the trailer you will notice all the funny little details that this one has.The cast is great and story I found it really creative with some interesting twists.Definitely the funniest dialogues are the discussions of Glen's sexuality between Tiffany and Chucky something really simple but unforgettable.Having Jennifer Tilly (playing herself and making fun of herself), Brad Dourif and John Waters in one movie... only Chucky (MTV nominee) could have done that.Just hilarious!!

157,lamson_thomas,Chuckys Child Plays... or Does it Prey?,7,23 May 2021,"Several Years have passed since the events of ""Bride of Chucky"", and in a metafictional twist, Animatronic dummies of Chucky and his kinda sorta loving bride Tiffany have been made, as well as unwittingly resurrected by Glen (aka Glenda. Aka $---Face.), the titular androginous child of the 2 dolls. Now one of Horror cinemas strangest Icons has a big, happy (yet very creepy) family... if that is he can keep his sociopathic urges in long enought to get them all human bodies.Taking what ""Bride of Chucky"" did with the ""Childs Play"" and increasing it tenfold, this 4th Wall smashing spin on the killer doll is an extreme satire not only of Chucky, but of Slasher films, Domestic Drama, and of Hollywood in General. Sadly, while the extremely self depricating humor ""Seed of Chucky"" exhibits is great fun at first, it soon grows stale, and by halfway through it begins to resemble an over long ""Scary Movie"" gag. Luckily, the film still remembers its a slasher film (And a bloody good one at that thanks to its SFX), and theres some genuinely cathartic moments and some suprising plot twists for horror buffs who have seen Childs play since the beginning.To conclude, ""Seed"" definately earns its title of the most divisive of Chuckys horror escapades. While both spinoffs of Childs play have altered our view of the little monster a great deal, let it not be said that ""Seed of Chucky"" is a suprisingly original take on Slasher Cinema.",Seed of Chucky

Series creator and writer, Don Mancini, finally steps into the director's chair for Seed of Chucky and proves that he's not only a capable director, but a rather unique one as well.The story picks up with Chucky and Tiffany's baby, Glenn, being used in a carnival sideshow. He breaks out and follows his parents to Hollywood where they're being used in a film based on their crime sprees. The film also stars Jennifer Tilly who seems to be having the time of her life sending up herself and Hollywood in general. Obviously, Chucky and Tiffany and resurrected and resume their killing sprees with an added dose of family drama thrown into the mix.The entire film has an excitingly fun and campy vibe throughout and the pacing of the film never eases up. It's one of the most thoroughly enjoyable horror/slasher films of the decade in which it was released. Many have complained that the franchise finally went full on satire here, but it's an exciting and interesting new direction and I didn't mind it one bit. The jokes are legitimately funny and it still offers up some gory set pieces. Mancini also deserves mad props for hiring frequent De Palma composer, Pino Donaggio, to compose an incredibly lush score for the film.",Seed of Chucky

Also, as another commenter pointed out, the celebrity spoofing (especially Jennifer Tilly) is getting ridiculous in general and just didn't work for this film. I hope that, if we're treated to another Chuck film, we get a ""Bride, "" not a ""Seed"". I think, however, that we've gotten all we can out of the ""Chucky"" series.

I am a big fan of the series and I like the direction it is going in, sort of becoming a horror/ comedy rather than a straight out horror (like the first 3). All of the voices are done perfectly and Billy Boyd was a great addition to the cast, although Glen/Glenda seems a little out of place in the presence of his mom and dad.

Although it is gory the film depends on comedy to entertain the audience. The film is funny but at times it feels inappropriate to laugh at some of these jokes. This is because the killing scenes are made to be funny. This may seem strange and obviously may offend some viewers. This is because the Chucky films are an acquired taste. Those who watch it may be either disgusted or entertained. If you have a strong stomach you should avoid it. However if you don't try not too take it too seriously. There is a noticeable difference between this and the superior original back in 1988. If you enjoyed that film you are almost certain to enjoy the latest installment in this popular horror franchise.,Seed of Chucky
165,mottaboy66,A film that knows what it is!,7,28 March 2005,"Often when a series of movies tries to sustain itself on countless sequels, it loses credibility fast. However, ""Seed Of Chucky"" takes a much more graceful approach to the passage of the Chucky movies from their prime. As the fifth movie starring the voice talent of Brad Dourif as the slasher doll Chucky, the film takes a comical stance by breaking the forth wall and bringing the characters of Chucky and his doll-face wife Tiff (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) into the real world, where they find themselves in Hollywood on the set of actress has-been Jennifer Tilly (played by herself). Waiting for them is Glen, the forgotten memento conceived by the two dolls in the previous movie. Seeking his long lost parents, Glen revives them once again to bring his family back together. Meanwhile, Jennifer Tilly's real life career is mirrored by her in-movie real life, with the added spice of a few killer dolls on her tail. I had been a big fan of the Chucky movies from the early nineties, and although I consider ""Bride Of Chucky"" which was made several years later, no where near the caliber of the originals, I was still willing to give this film a chance. I am glad I did, because rather than once again beating a dead horse, the Chucky series has aged into a witty storyline that attacks itself for our amusement. Redman makes an appearance in the film as well... for whatever reason. Don't worry too much though, because you must know, as I did when I saw his name in the credits, that as the only black person billed, he's simply doomed. BOTTOM LINE: The director of ""Seed Of Chucky"" knew where the series stood in the eyes of its fans, and rather than spit in their faces by dragging its credibility through more mud, he instead had it put on a funny mask and take one last bow before the curtain closed.",Seed of Chucky

So now that October has begun, I decided to give the saga another chance and convinced my parents to see an horror movie with me. I can't explain why I chose this one. I guess it was just the first one that netflix recommended.
It was a huge hit. We laughed a lot and my mom still got kinda grossed out and surprised at some scenes, which is even more entertaining than just plain humor.

(But I do have one, small gripe: is it me, or did that fight scene at the end seem just a little bit too easy? I mean, come on! Chucky never even had half a chance before Jennifer Tilly/Tiffany passed Glen the axe! No, no. If I had been in charge of the writing; I would have made it so that poor Chuck had time to strike back a few times- you know, like he normally has.)In regards to everything else though: great. Brad Dourif: as always; delivers two hundred and fifty percent of himself! Perfection. (If you want my opinion; I'd say he's one of the main reasons this series is so well liked! Everybody loves a bad boy.)He's such a great screamer. (I actually found myself feeling sorry for him a lot in this one.) The soundtrack is really nice. Creepy. (Much like 'Bride of')The main title sequence has one of the most disturbing visuals of birth I have ever seen. (Much like 'Bride of' has one of the strangest sex scenes I've ever seen.) Jennifer Tilly: Well . . .I'm not sure how to feel about her. I mean, I like her enough as an actress (like in 'Hide and Seek'; she was just evil) but in this . . .she probably could have played herself less like a damsel-in-distress, and given herself a little more self confidence. Redman: awful. Worst acting I've seen in a long while. (But I must admit; he did make me wanna slug him, 'cause of the way he was treating the afore mentioned Ms. Tilly.) I think Tiffany says it best: ""That pig!""Billy Boyd: Awe. Loved him in LOTR, loved him in this. (I knew right away that Glen was a boy.

Chucky and Tiffany are brought back to life by their child. The two do not know if the child is a male or female. So the child goes by the names Glen and Glenda. Just like the first film, Chucky and Tiff go on the hunt for bodies to posses so they no longer have to be dolls. They find themselves in Hollywood and go after celebs. Sounds stupid huh? Well yeah it is, but the murderous couple go after the bodies of Jennifer Tilly and rapper Redman. This plot is so not serious that it is really entertaining.

The killer couple also find out there's a movie being made about them, so they take their homicidal habits all over Hollywood. Okay first off, you're probably wondering why I'm reviewing a movie that's nearly a decade old. Well, for two reasons: 1.) there's a new Chucky movie coming out this Halloween. And 2.) the Child's Play franchise has always been my favorite horror movie series. Now, this is just my personal opinion, and I know a lot people actually hated this movie, but I think it's the best Chucky film ever! But before you make fun of me or think I'm crazy, let me explain why I love this movie. I just love how this film is not really serious and how it's very comical. I know this is why most people hate it, but I mean, come on! How can a movie about a killer doll be ""serious""? I also love Chucky's hilarious lines. I think I probably laughed thoroughly the entire movie...especially at that ""A masturbating midget?"" part! Haha!Furthermore, Jennifer Tilly did a great job playing these two characters: Tiffany Ray and a parody character of herself. The other actors did a good job too, but as always, Brad Dourif's voice as Chucky steals the spotlight! *WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!* Another thing I enjoyed was how Don Mancini wrote the character of Glen. I thought it was very interesting to have him have two separate souls inside one doll body; Glen being the sweet, polite boy who took control of the body most of the time, and Glenda, Glen's violent alter-ego. And I like how at the end of the movie, these two souls each got their own bodies when they became human. (Human Glen is so cute!) Here's what I didn't like about the film: I do actually agree with most people; this movie was cheesy. They could've done a lot better creating this movie if they tried hard enough, but oh well. If they just had a few more scares and less cheesiness, then this would be the perfect movie. But besides for the cheesy stuff, I really enjoyed this movie. It's always has and always will be my favorite out of the whole series, with Bride of Chucky coming in as a close second. Don Mancini sure knows how to blend the perfect mix of comedy and horror for a Horror/Comedy movie like this one.Bottom line, if you're a TRUE Chucky fan, and can see past the film's flaws, you will love this movie!Overall, I give Seed of Chucky a 9 out of 10.

I read many negative reviews prior to watching this movie and was quite ready for a major disappointment. However, it did not happen. In my opinion, the movie is the crown of the entire series, an ode to Chucky, the star of popular culture. Look how he refuses to become human ...superb! For a lover of camp, gory flicks, horror and parody, there are so many delightful moments in the movie. However, it is not horror as such,nor any other particular genre for that matter. Chucky is not even the main star of the movie! I have already declared myself as a fan, and maybe my view is not entirely unbiased. Still, here are some things I particularly enjoyed:1. The appearance of John Waters as an actor. Need I say more? Big +2. Glen/Glenda who speaks with British accent, resembles David Bowie from his Ziggy Stardust phase and has sexual/personality identity issues. How cool is that? Big +3. Very clear references, notably to Psycho, Shining, Rosemary's Baby (and some other movies by Mr. Polanski, but more in the form of allusions), and even Pinnochio. I am sure there are many more. Big +4. Jennifer Tilly, one of the sexiest, most sensual, intelligent actresses I have ever seen. Ideal for all sorts of subversive films. Of course, she is wonderful in this one too. Mmm... Jennifer I love you. There, I have said it. Big +5. Directing, music,setting, costumes. Yes, I liked them all... Thank you people, well done. 9/10",Seed of Chucky
182,Eberts_HomeBoy,A Timeless Horror/Comedy..........,10,29 June 2005,"I only have 3 words to describe this film. FUNNY AS HELL!!! I walked in to the theater expecting to get a few frights and maybe laugh a little because 'BRIDE OF CHUCKY' cracked me up. As I watched the first scene my expectations were true, only to be proved wrong when the young girl Claudia called out to Glen, ""You're pissing your pants! You're pissing your pants!"" The audience went hysterical. When I walked out of the theater I thought to myself, ""Don Mancini has really reinvented these movies in a way you never thought he would."" ""He's taken a horrifying character, Chucky, and turned him into a father! A family man!"" This turns people away from these movies I think, but trust me it's not a bad thing! This movie will make you laugh, cry, and hide for face behind your hands. It's the perfect popcorn movie. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good laugh.10 Reasons you should watch this movie.1. It's funny as hell.2. It has awesome killings.3. Jennifer Tilly's Boobs.4. Gender confused doll.5. Chucky and Tiffany making out in front of a body spewing blood from the neck.6. Jennifer Tilly's Boobs.7. John Waters 8. Jennifer Tilly's Boobs.9. Masturbating Doll.10. Did I mention Jennifer Tilly's Boobs?",Seed of Chucky
183,ElsaSchneiderXX,Chucky is the coolest guy ever! Hilarious!,9,19 December 2004,"OK, here we go again: Chucky still running around in his silly pants with the scars on his face. Still evil, still hilarious, still SO cool. Grinning sweetheart he is, murdering one after the other in that movie, being more ""human"" than ever. Obviously he finally feels comfortable with his life as a doll. This movie is very bloody, very funny and is not scary for one single moment. Chucky has lost his psycho-ness and changed into a comedian it seems - and it suits him very good. The plot is OK, using the movie-in-a-movie technique is not very inventory but alright. Jennifer Tilly playing herself is very strange, if you don't know that fact right at the beginning. But she is doing fine as all the other human protagonists do. Unfortunately Chucky's kid is very awful. It is annoying, looking strange, not even really ugly. Its behavior does not fit into the character of the Chucky movies and sometimes it even seems as if the makers had taken themselves SERIOUS - no way! The ending of the movie is therefore really bad and destroying a lot of the laugh-about atmosphere. The intro of the movie is absolutely great and so are the credits. Nicely made, really. I also liked the movement of the dolls, how they acted and looked. I didn't like the kid and some scenes were really a bit too much (artificial insemination..) to be funny. A lot of people dying on more or less spectacular ways, some really funny scenes (including Britney, masturbating, turbo-pregnancy, sidekicks on other movies and so on) but after all, all the FAMILY wouldn't really be necessary: It's finally all about Chucky and will hopefully be even more about him in the following movie...",Seed of Chucky
184,horrors_R_us,"It's A Hobby Really, It Helps Us Relax...",10,3 July 2006,"I think any Chucky fan will be pleased, especially if you liked Bride of Chucky. If you don't have the Chuck spirit then chances are slim that you'd be interested.Maybe it's not an Oscar worthy film but it has a likable substance to it. It makes you laugh and if your gore fan you won't be let down. I particularly fell in love with Glen or Glenda, Chucky and Tiffany's gender confused and kind hearted offspring. The bickering over 'its' sex was hilarious.I also liked Jennifer Tilly, considering she does Tiffany's voice and plays herself in this movie. To see Jennifer getting asked for an autograph by a doll with her voice was priceless. Speaking of Tiffany, she still has the classic 'my mother always said' lines.The gore was there but not to over the top. Chucky is still in the killing craze (even after making a promise with Tiff to stop) while Glen/Glenda and Tiffany aren't going to have any of it. Tiffany herself even gets help by consulting a book and calling a hot line when things get hard to contain (even if she kills Redman in the end). Glen/Glenda also have its moment of killing by setting fire to Jennifer's assistant Joan. I have to say that before you put this movie down, I say go see it first and give it chance. You might not be disappointed.10/10 for sure!",Seed of Chucky
185,arkitektwarcraftninja,"A New Light, A complete change of Chucky by the Times.",6,22 January 2007,"The first Childs Play I saw was Part 3. It was an exciting, intense roller-coaster 90's horror slasher. I immediately saw why Childs play was so popular. Then once during a horror DVD rental night. I knew the original would be just as good. It was. Childs Play 2 Inevitably Wielded the sequel curse. Which is the destiny of an 80 Min Horror. Then I saw the Bride of chucky. Without a doubt the best yet. There was no reason to hate Seed. When I saw SOC, I was enjoying it no doubt. However there are many disappointments in this sequel. The Two Most impressive Death sequences, The England House Stabbing and Chucky Slicing up the Santa were either dreams, or an in movie - movie sequence. Which really broke the atmosphere. Disappointed, i was still watching it. And i noticed it is now a black comedy. I didn't laugh a lot anyway... I don't think it will be kept to the old routine due to repeditivity. So they add in doll-wives and doll-sons/daughters and a private life. If you accept the fact Chucky Is a world of magic, It's easy to believe Tiffanny. But certainly not Glen. I Watched Chucky like it's a real world of magic and the bizarre idea a doll is possessed by a serial killer. Glen is a segment of the movie the keeps you thinking. That's simply impossible. IF there was such thing as magic, And a doll grew organs, I don't know what would happen. It's all been believable until glen came in it would turn out nothing like an ugly doll. Just something Dead or inhuman. Apart from that, Although there are many moral and technical goofs, Like if your neck was wrapped around by wire and pulled it simply WOULDN'T Fly that high. Don't get me wrong, though wire can slice off your head. The picture isn't overly Filtered. The less filtered the better in Horror films. Redman And Brad Dourif did some good acting, (Although Brads movements don't look right obviously) and The special effects weren't that bad. The closet scenes were stupid but overall, The change of Chucky hasn't been Simpson's like, just a very odd way. You might as well watch it if you've seen the other ones, or if you wanna see a slasher comedy, (Watch Sean of the Dead first) The is a unique movie even through its faults.",Seed of Chucky

The script was horrible, the film was lame and didn't move the story any further than the last Chucky movie, and it just felt choppy and wrong. I give this movie a 3. Reasons it didn't get a 2? Or a 1? Chucky had some great one liners in this-some of it was classic. Otherwise..this movie was HORRIBLE. I'd like to discard it and pretend it doesn't exist (the same with A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 &6).",Seed of Chucky

Anyone who has followed the series knows that it switched from horror to comedy after the first movie...and that's fine with me! I'm one of those sick, demented freaks that gets a kick out of watching dolls go around swearing like sailors, making human blood baths, and now in this movie, even showing what you could call ""plastic porn""! LOL! Anyone considering going to this movie to be ""scared"" needs to go a few theatre doors down and see ""The Grudge"", because the sole purpose of ""Seed Of Chucky"" is to offend, gross out, and make you laugh hysterically which it is a complete success at doing! Although this will not be a blockbuster at the box office, I am very glad that it did get a theatrical release...(no matter how short it may be)! :-)",Seed of Chucky
188,ProjetErreur,The best 4th sequel to a killer doll movie yet...,7,17 August 2005,"""Seed of Chucky"" isn't meant to scare you. Just like ""Bride of Chucky,"" ""Seed of Chucky"" was written as a comedy, and it succeeds.Why did they decide to turn Chucky into a comedian? Well, perhaps Writer Don Mancini knew how corny the premise was, so he thought the only logical way was to turn it into a comedy. He was smart. It's better to make a movie a comedy on purpose than for that movie to get its laughs unintentionally.""Child's Play"" worked as a horror movie because viewers didn't know for certain the doll was alive. Viewers were led to think that it was possible for Andy, the boy who was given Chucky for his birthday, to be committing the murders. Chucky, as a doll, doesn't utter his first word until halfway through ""Child's Play,"" and when it happens, it shocks its viewers.""Child's Play 2"" and 3, although entertaining, didn't (and couldn't) produce the same shock value as the original. Why? Because viewers already knew Chucky was alive, which diminishes the whole point of the original. Chucky speaks in practically the opening scene of Part 2 and 3, which leaves viewers to think: ""what am I supposed to be scared about?"" In the original, we knew as much as the people who thought Andy was crazy for saying the doll was alive did. In Parts 2 and 3, we knew everyone but Andy was wrong from the start.So Don Mancini went in a direction, and a smart one at that, by making Chucky for laughs. ""Seed of Chucky"" begins with Chucky's son Glen, who Tiffany gave birth to in the previous installment, working at a circus as a sideshow freak. When he sees a film is being made about his killer doll parents, he decides to pursue them.When Glen gets to the movie set, he uses the famous voodoo chant to turn a replica Chucky and Tiffany doll to life. Now, the 3 dolls go on a killing spree.Tiffany wants to transfer her soul into Jennifer Tilly's body (who plays herself and also provides the voice of Tiffany, and coincidentally provided the voice of Tiffany in the movie-within-the-movie about Chucky and Tiffany); Chucky wants to transfer his soul into Rapper Redman (playing himself also); and Tiffany plans on getting Jennifer Tilly pregnant with Redman's child, and upon accomplishing this, Glen will have somewhere to transfer his soul.Without giving too much away, the film has some funny moments, including Chucky and Tiffany's argument about how they shouldn't kill so much around their child, Tiffany's ""Rome wasn't built in one day"" phone conversation, Tiffany calling Jennifer Tilly fat (who plays her) and a downright hilarious Britney Spears scene.This film is great for what it tries to accomplish. It deserves credit. This is a 5th installment, which is certainly better than the 5th (and the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and following)installments of ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Hellraiser,"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" Brad Dourif's voice can not be bettered. He IS Chucky. His voice matches Chucky the doll's look so much, that, you actually believe the doll is talking.Watch this movie for the laughs. It's hilarious. Trust me when I say this, This is the best 5th installment about a killer doll you will ever see.",Seed of Chucky

190,jewarner-2,Pure Cinema Reflexive Genius,10,12 November 2004,"This has to be one of the best reflexive movies of the year. First off, the child has a deep root to Norman Bates in Psycho, even quoting the ""I wouldn't harm a fly."" That is just the beginning. One of the best scenes is when Chucky is capturing Jennifer Tilly, and the doll, Tiffany (played by Jennifer) is talking on the phone to Joan, which is Jennifer's assistant. Jennifer Tilly is screaming, and Joan is asking why she is screaming,a nd Tiffany tells her that she is just watching herself being fingered in Bound. I found it funny that most people weren't laughing the theater. I feel most of it is due to the lack of culture of films. They only want to see new ones, and don't care to brush up on their classics and independent cinema. This movie is extremely well thought out and funny on both a high brow and a low brow manner. I was enthralled to see John Waters in the film. Of course, I love the marvelous Jennifer Tilly. And to put the cherry on the sundae, it ends with the Blondie song, ""One Way or Another""! Pure genius...",Seed of Chucky

Only to put some Japanese jokes I think... pretty lame. But this was the only problem for me.Still, they really thought of some original & funny jokes. Never a dull moment. The murder scenes are also well planned and original. Chucky is no longer just a killing doll but has an interesting personality, something they begun to uncover in the prequel: Bride of Chucky.

Tacky scenes? There're plenty. This film is definitely tacky! I loved it for that . The end scene catches you by surprise, but I won't spoil it for you, I'll just say ""Stop peeing your pants!"".So why only a five? The whole thing is starting to get a bit samey. You KNOW it'll be a bloodbath, you know it'll be tacky and it lets it down in my opinion. There's only so much mileage in a concept and this is definitely the last drop of petrol.",Seed of Chucky

SEED OF CHUCKY is exactly what I am talking about.During the late 1980's a film came out that twinkled the corner of every horror fan's eye. This was Child's Play. It was so successful because its plot line was so unique and original. But after the third installment, the producers became foolish and decided to add a twist to the series. This is when it went downhill.The idea of a living, breathing, killing doll marrying and having intimate relationships with another doll is one thing, but dolls having babies now? SEED OF CHUCKY takes the series on a whole new plot course where Chucky and Tiffany decide to give up killing for the benefits of their son. It involves the three dolls once again trying to escape from their plastic bodies, this time into two famous celebrities'--Redman's and Jennifer Tilly's. Now if this doesn't deter you I don't know what will.If they decide to make a sixth film, they have got to have severe brain damage.",Seed of Chucky

I'm not saying the acting is bad it's pretty decent however why can't they go back to the Chucky that made me have nightmares? Not the one that made me laugh! He shouldn't have a wife or a son. He should be pi$$ed off and evil. Not a family man! Plenty of kills but not enough thrills. Red man why the hell was he in here other than to promote his music. I thought the idea of Jennifer Tily staring in this film was clever but again too much comedy.

Child's Play 3 is better then this one, but saying that, Child's Play 3 is my favourite Chucky movie, so I can't say much other than ""Just stay away from this movie""! The really only good part is at the beginning when 2 people and a doll get killed in less that 10 minutes lol.

Bride of Chucky was brilliantly done by Ronny Yu, and has only been slightly disappointing in Child's Play 3 which was still an overall decent horror film. Seed of Chucky on the other hand is an absolute joke. The violence was really silly in the film and had a lot exuberant deaths which seemed highly out of place. The story was believable for what the end of Bride left for us to go with. By the end of Seed I knew I could care less what the end had in store. I lost interest with the Glenn character, and Tiffany way too early in this film. It also seemed to me that Chucky got much less screen time in this picture which disappointed me. All of his scenes were the best the film had to offer. I couldn't but laugh with emberassment at every scene with Glenn. Fans of the first 4 movies of the franchises- I can tell you I like every one of those for something in them, and Seed of Chucky offers nothing.

Along to join Chucky and Tiff (Chucky's bride) in this movie is the little, orange-haired, English-accented Glen. Now, even though I am only 14 years old I have seen all of the Child's Play movies and I think this one is great even though I'm more of a fan of the old filming. In this film you'll find more creative killing techniques and you'll be surprised. In this film a L.A. studio is making a film of the ""unsolved"" killings in which a set of two dolls are left at each crime seen. Which is funny in itself because any killings that occur on-set are mistaken for props and fake blood.

Instead it opted for an enormous overdosage of gore. This is good though, blood is good.Chucky was about as important a character in this one as he was 16 years ago. Tiffany and Jennifer Tilly dominated this movie. Which wasn't that bad, because Tilly is hot...This movie had a lot of great lines (especially near the end). And with a bunch of humor it is a greatly enjoyable experience. I can't wait for the sequel.Overall this movie gets for me about a 9.9/10. I loved this movie and saw it about 5 times.

With the birth of their genderless child, Glen/Glenda, Chucky and Tiffany are determined not to set a bad example by killing people. But by being in Hollywood, they can't resist. Jennifer Tilly (playing herself and voicing Tiffany) plays host to this family, as well as trying to get a role in the upcoming bible epic. The plot remains simple, Tiffany invented a plan for Chucky, Glen/Glenda and herself to transfer their souls back into their human bodies using a cruel method.All in all, this movie is certainly not scary but more of a comedy, with lots of funny one liners by everyone and obese jokes on Jennifer Tilly.

Yes the movie is a satire and black comedy not to be taken seriously, just like William Shakespeare's work.I loved the humour, but then it suited me...especially the Patrick Bateman reference (American Psycho) and the fact that Jennifer Tilly had the balls (not literally ha ha) to ridicule herself and play ""Tiff"" at the same time. Very satisfying. As well as Redman doing something similar.And lets not forget the family values message and intelligent insight into how mass murderer's shouldn't really have children as they will probably end up one themselves (the child that is) and become the spawn of Satan himself, with the red outfit and ""fork"" isn't the right word, but it's the first that comes to mind.Anyway, I hope more people will appreciate this movie after reading this review.Is it a masterpiece?

205,WoAH_CrAzY_o1,I Love this movie,10,6 July 2006,"I have viewed the recent comments of people who hated the movie. They have said that this movie isn't original, in fact they are correct in some proportion, but the only unoriginality is the doll being ""alive"". But they have never had a doll, being the star of the movie.This more recent movie, ""Seed Of Chucky"", isn't as scary as the past ones. But they replaced that with comedy, which i found the movie funny and had some blood and extra in it.The plot does seem to be the same, but i love how they added a child to the movie, it give it a more family feeling to it, they go through things like a normal family would, as they explain in the special features on the DVD. As in ""Bride Of Chucky"", they had romance, they kissed, got married, and made love, like a real person would, so technically it goes through real life events, adding in which the child come along in the next movie.I can see where some people come from where he doesn't die as a real person should. He is in fact suppose to be a real person inside a doll, and he should be able to die easily, but his head, as one commenter had said, is wood, it isn't wood, its plastic and rubber, what doll is made of wood? But anyways, what do you have to say about Jason, Freddy, and so on, they too don't die easily, so people who like those movies are just missing the fact that Chucky does the same. When Freddie's head gets cut off and Jason is caring it on the beach at the end of Freddy vs. Jason, he blinks, how can a head blink.In other words, i love this movie, and for the people who made this movie, they put a lot of time and thought into it, they i guess wanted to make it a little funnier, and i don't see anything wrong with that, at all. They do put a lot of working into this movie because they have a lot of people to make the dolls movie, and it takes several years to complete it, so u have to give them some credit.This movie is the best, and for your time i would like to say.....in the words of Chucky.....F**K YOU VERY MUCH",Seed of Chucky

Basic premise: Chucky and Tiffany were murdered in the last film, but as she died, Tiffany gave birth to a...well, a child. The kid's name is either Glen or Glenda, depending on how you look at it. Living in England, he becomes a side-show freak named s***head. In America, a movie is being made about the Chucky and Tiffany murders and the robotic dolls are on Access Hollywood or something promoting it. Their son is watching it so he travels to find his parents. Somehow, he finds his way into the exact room that the dolls are in and uses the amulet to bring them back to life. To make a long story short, they go on a killing spree around Hollywood and make an insanely pointless movie.

They don't use half as many special effects and one in B/W. They never even dreamt of using hi-tech gadgetry. Look at what a success they were. How do you explain this?And as I say this it is such a tragic shame that the last 2 films were such failures. Okay The 3rd wasn't too bad YET and I have to admit this had funny moments and I laughed but the last 2 just make you think completely differently. To be honest I burst out laughing when I watched Seed of Chucky and the previous sequel, NOT because of the clever humour scenes but because how deluded the writer who wrote all 5 scripts actually is. True it does ""entertain"" which I would give maybe ***/***** for that factor. But it's not about that, it's about the actual film in accordance to its predecessors. It doesn't really work if you put one film classified one theme and then the next as another because this would be just a simple contradiction. Another downside is that there are many sexual pictures which just completely abolishes all types of horror feeling which in many respects ruins the rest of the film from the first one. The only and I mean only good key element to this film is, not because they had a sexy star or a cute doll voice but because Chucky himself discovered a new personality but unimaginatively cannot make up for all this mess. As this actually is a good idea it is even more of a pity for conveying this in a much different manner.The only film I can think of that matches this utter tediousness in FRIGHT NIGHT PART 2.This also has ridiculous special effects. And I wouldn't have been as shocked as I would have been if I didn't see this film in advance. lucky I did. It sort of prepared me for the worse although this film is about vampires not a freaky killer doll which suddenly becomes a fun play doll.My advice is this for those who haven't seen SEED OF CHUKEY yet is this: You should watch it NOT because it's a good film but because it's worth the laughter and the knowledge of failure, for you to see with your own eyes. HOWEVER watch FRIGHT NIGHT PART 2 HORROR for the ridiculous storyline and very slightly better special effects to give you a better idea of what the film will be like although it has a completely different plot about vampires. If you've seen it already then just read the line below.If you loved Fright Night Part 2 you will love this film. If you have completely agreed with me so far and think that Fright Night Part 2 is poor then you will think that Seed Of Chucky is.I rate this film * to *1/2 /*****IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN OTHER CHUKEY FILMS PLEASE READ ONThis is how I sum up the chucky series... observe the pattern1st CHILD'S PLAY 1988 BEST2nd CHILD'S PLAY 2 1990 2nd best3rd CHILD'SPLAY 3 1991 3rd best4th BRIDE OF CHUCKY 1998 4th best5th SEED OF CHUCKY 2004 WORSTThink about it. The 2 first films made were made a long time back. The last 2 quite recently. And as I will always believe that older films will become more of a success and more of them titled ""classic"". I think the first out of the series is the only to be given the title CLASSIC. And gradually and slowly get worse and worse until it is at it's limit. Some genius would have to be born to make a horror worse than this one.For me the original Child's Play was by miles the best because: no unrealistic parts no exaggerated scenes No boring parts no high technology, which is the key in this area JUST A GEUINE MASTERPIECETo make matters worse a remake of the original will be made and be out in 2009. I am excited BUT I have absolutely no idea how it can possibly be improved.",Seed of Chucky
214,elahah_ariana,One of the most pathetic attempts at a film of all time.,1,14 November 2010,"This movie was so awful that i wanted to give it a -10 but that's not an option on here. This movie was pathetic and it just failed on every level that a movie can fail. Any gore in the movie was so obviously fake that it was sad. The story line was absurd and the movie's attempts at humour were just plain disgraceful. This movie tried to be a horror- comedy type film but it failed on both accounts. The jokes they made are old and tired and the most they do is make you roll your eyes. This film tried to have the audience laugh with them but instead they got people to laugh AT them. This movie is the biggest waste of time and it is 87 minutes of my life that i will never get back. The best word to describe the movie is FAILURE. If you want to see a really good horror-comedy i recommend skipping this film and picking up a film like ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Zombieland"" which are amazing films!",Seed of Chucky
215,oingo_boingo-wildsex,Hilarious!!!,10,25 April 2011,"Let me just start off by saying I'm not entirely sure of what, exactly, is considered a ""spoiler"" on this website, but to be safe I checked the ""spoiler"" box anyway. I *love* this movie!!! I recently watched all 5 Chucky movies, and they've been having me laughing ever since! When that paparazzi guy (John Waters) was looking in the window and he saw Chucky and went like ""A masturbating midget?!?!!!"".... Lol!!! That was hysterical!!! I would give this movie, and all the other Chucky movies, ten out of ten stars. The most disappointing part of this movie was towards the ending. I couldn't believe Chucky didn't turn into a human! I was like ""Noooo!!! Chucky! Just say ""Ade Due Dambella! Give Me The Power I Beg Of You!!"". Lol. But he didn't, unfortunately. Anyway, I guess they kept Chucky a doll so they can make more movies in the future. Which is actually kind of irritating, because what are they going to do? I mean, really, now we all love Tiffany and want to see her, and of course we want to see what happens to Glen & Glenda. I thought the ending was kind of stupid. When Glen killed Chucky, I was like ""Noooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!"" because I wanted them to live as an evil doll family. I was annoyed with Tiffany, too, because she wanted to stop killing... What?! That was kind of annoying. Anyway, I think this movie was not nearly as great as the hilarious ""Bride Of Chucky"", but it's still pretty funny & good. The first Chucky movie I saw was ""Bride Of Chucky"", actually, in the early 2000s. I then saw all the others, but my memory of the movies was very foggy so I recently watched all five movies. Plus, I'm a bit older now, and I understand the movies a lot better. Overall, I'd say ""Bride Of Chucky"" was my favorite. I know I've gotten way off topic, and this is pretty irrelevant to ""Seed Of Chucky"", but apparently my original review was not long enough. To sum things up: Hilarious movie, I recommend it (after watching the previous four Chucky movies). PS: I am not ""shouting"", I'm simply putting emphasis on a quote from Chucky which I (for some reason) find hilarious (Ade due dambella, *all caps* give me the power I beg of you!!).",Seed of Chucky
216,cat01894,Spoiler Watch Out,10,23 November 2004,"This movie turned out better then I thought it would. I has everything, action, violence, romance, comedy, horror, suspense, and a great story. Chucky new movie in a movie has to me a meaning. Because the name of the movie is ?Chucky goes Psycho,? near the end it seems he really does go psycho. Well the characters of the movie are well expressed. Tiffany in my opinion became more of a wimp, when she discovered that she was a mom. Chucky was heartless and even more sexy then before. Though you can start to hear Brad Dourif?s age, even though it?s hardly noticeable. Glen I think they could have done better on his look and Billy Boyd was totally the wrong voice for him. I mean come on Chucky spawned a hobbit. Jennifer Tilly was a big witch in the movie I was glad when she got hers. Redman was a complete horny toad It made you just want to smack him a good one. The movie over all was the best of the series by far.",Seed of Chucky
217,CoyoteShivers,"A heart-warming, family comedy",10,27 June 2005,"I found this movie to be a great study of family relations and dynamics. It tackles all the important issues: naming a child, gender identity, child rearing, and family addiction. And best part about it was: they were dolls, man. I'm glad they went with the humorous route because continuous horror movies like this have a level of absurdity to them. So, to take it seriously would hinder the audiences perception of the movie. I loved the dialogue in the movie was fabulous and quick-witted. It utilized the actors in a great way. Brad Dourif shown in a performance that was on par with his Wormtongue performance(Lord of the Rings). The dialogue made great use of his trademark voice with lines like: ""He looks like the kid fell off the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down."" or ""Not violence. ""Violins."" Violins are bad. That screeching music is gonna ruin the goddamn country."" or Glen:""Why do you kill?"" Chucky:""Um...hobby, I guess"" Also, I loved the inclusion of John Waters(with the best line ""God bless, the little people!""), the Ed Wood reference, the mockery of the Shining references, Billy Boyd(as Glen/Glenda, with a voice that questions gender), Jason Flemyng(of Guy Ritchie movies fame), Hannah Spearitt(former S Club 7 member), Redman, and Jeniffer Tilly(playing herself as well).I found this to be a very appropriate movie full of emotional goodness and it shows how families are really like. I recommend this to see with your family. They did a good job of what they set out to do and that it is to make a family-oriented Chucky movie. I'm all up for a sequel or sequels. They should make a musical or CHucky Goes Sorority. There's no end to the possibilities.",Seed of Chucky

I've felt each of the films, from one to four, were not only entertaining, but very likable. I must say, before last night I felt Child's Play 3 had the most to complain about, but Seed of Chucky has proved me wrong.It is just a grotesquely bad film. Not funny. And not very entertaining.4/101/5 starsThe only reason I give Seed of Chucky a little decent respect, is because I have a lot respect for Jennifer Tilly as an actress. She does what she feels is fun. She's not worried about critical success or box office numbers, and she even makes fun of herself numerous of times in this film. Jennifer Tilly, although this film was a horrid experience, I give you many praises.Plus, Tiffany is the best character in this film.

Its a bit more sexually oriented than the other films also, but it doesn't detract from the movie. For being called 'Seed of Chucky' though, yo'd think there would be more of the Seed (Glen, Glenda, whatever) in it! I'm a fan of Billy Boy'd and would of liked to have seen more of him. His voice fits the character so perfectly. Its sweet and gentle...and slightly homicidal at times. Its a perfect foil from Brad Dourif's portrayal of the rough killer doll.

It's also cool to see Don Mancini's directorial debut after writing them all and he did a damn good job. There's some sweet killings and cool tributes to other films (like Ed Wood's Glen Or Glenda.....that was awesome). The comedy factor in this is hilarious especially Jen Tilly ripping on herself and you know what? Redman was actually good in this, he really didn't p*ss me off like I thought he would but I actually enjoyed his performance. This is just an all around fun-ass movie.

221,bubix14,Seed of Chucky: A New Generation in Terror,1,15 October 2009,"I happen to say that I hated ""Seed of Chucky"". I mean the beginning was bad but the ending was very bad enough. Early in 2006, for my birthday, I got a Child's Play DVD with Chucky and I watched it and I was a little bit scared. Then, I saw ""Seed of Chucky"" and it was very awful. Here's how the story goes: The movie opens with Glen, a peace-loving hippie doll that is stranded in Glastonbury, England doing a puppet show and is being chastised by his owner, Psychs for not being scary enough. However, he has horrible visions of killing and murdering people. Then, one day, he sees on the television two dolls that are becoming famous movie stars and are starring in a movie called, ""Chucky Goes Psycho"", which is about two dolls that are controlled by serial killers and have never been solved until now and he realizes that they might be his parents. So, Glen escapes his mean owner and heads for Hollywood and uses the voodoo amulet Damballah to awaken his parents, Tiffany and her husband. What Glen doesn't realize is that his parents are mass murderers and are addicting to killing people. Glen tells his parents to end this horrible violence. Tiffany seems interested and wants to end her killing ways. However, her husband thinks that he wants to continue doing the killing because it makes him feel good. Eventually, the two dolls agree to stop killing. But not for long. The two dolls start killing again. Dousing a paparazzi's head with sulfuric acid to stabbing a famous rapper's guts to Chucky wanting to remain as a killer doll so that he could continue his killing ways all leads up to a fight between Glen and another serial killing doll named Chucky.What I hated about this movie were the murders. It was all plain, 100 percent murder. Everything from disembowelment to decapitations to just about everything not counting John Waters's cameo as a corrupt paparazzi. I would recommend this movie to anyone who's a Chucky fan and have seen all of the Child's Play movies but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone because of the violence and murder and it's not for the squeamish. What a terribly awful film. Avoid!",Seed of Chucky
222,orangecountydork,Child's Play meet All in the Family,10,17 November 2004,"There's a time to put away childish things. Well, there's never a time to put away killer dolls it seems. Good reason, too. The latest outing that places supernaturally possessed Good Guy doll Chucky pairs him once again with his twisted wife Tiffany and the shockingly sweet asexual child Glen/Glenda. The family is in Hollywood for a movie being made about the events of Bride of Chucky, excluding everything that happened in that film except the fact it had one scene in a cemetery. Anyway, the plot thickens with Tiffany wanting to place her soul in Jennifer Tilly. Amazing how Tiffany's such a big fan of such a talented and angel voiced actress such as Jennifer Tilly, right? The twisted obsession Tiffany seems to have regarding Tilly marks most of the film's hilarity. Chucky takes a step back from the most memorable moments in the film. They all pretty much go to Tiffany (her obsession with Tilly, her goal to be a reformed serial killer in hopes to offer Glen/Glenda a better life) and Glen/Glenda (the constant wetting of his/her pants, the overall cute-in-a-grotesque-way appearance, and the plot twist involving its true gender). Fear not true fans of the Chuck! The character has one moment within the film that brings all five movies to a nice resting point in regards to their plots. No spoilers here.Just review in your mind what has occurred in each movie; what was a constant goal for him. Now that you have a vague idea, go see the movie to cheer him on in his moment of glory!Now the movie moves at a surreal pace. It never stops to give the characters a moment to build themselves up. Jennifer Tilly and Redman (as themselves) prove to be a weak point. They're 2-D, paper thin characters. It's during scenes with them that I got antsy, squirmy in my seat. They had no development. Tilly was a slut. Redman wasn't anything, really, but Redman. He wasn't funny in his role as director of the story of Jesus' birth and he wasn't funny as the rapper love interest of Tilly. Both fell flat compared to the only a bit more developed characters of Tiffany and Chucky. The one with the most character development is the newbie, Glen/Glenda. Definitely what keeps me going back to see the film. I've seen it twice just to see the kid in action as the creepiest and yet cutest thing since the original Good Guy doll of Child's Play 1-3. All in all, mediocre movie that excels in its pop culture stabs and absurd storyline. It is worth 9/10 just for the moment I described as Chucky's shining moment as well as anything having to do with Glen/Glenda and Tiffany's rehab for killers' storyline. I would remove points solely for Redman. If he had been replaced by someone more known and less awkward in his role as himself then the film would have been brilliant instead of excellent.Go see it. Support the film to help get the powers that be to start pondering whether or not Chucky and his family should come back to haunt us all in a sixth feature film. Sadly, though, we might not see Chucky on the big screen again. The films, starting with Bride of Chucky, are beginning to have the feel of Direct-to-Video. Fingers cross this does not happen and we get another round of killer dolls in a theater near you sooner than the six years it took to make this film.",Seed of Chucky

226,rgaudion,Chucky and Tiffany set off on a Hollywood killing spree!,5,7 February 2005,"The fifth film in Don Mancini's Child's Play series puts more emphasis on garish comedy with a little less of the super-abundant horror of the previous gore-fests. Seed of Chucky is a movie within a movie: first, there is a silly and mildly amusing spoof in which Jennifer Tilly (The Haunted Mansion) near enough plays herself, a desperate actress in Hollywood shooting a lame horror movie, Chucky Goes Psycho, mulling over her stalled career and quite understandably bitching about the success of Julia Roberts. The second 'plot' sees the devilish Chucky doll (voiced by Brad Dourif) and his bloodthirsty wife, the Tiffany doll (Tilly), being resurrected by their sideshow freak child-spawn, the Glen doll (voiced by Billy Boyd, probably better known as Pippin from Lord of The Rings). Actually, the Glen doll is really a bit of a geezer-bird, a him-she, a man-bird: also known as Glenda when he feels like being a she. Anyway, the not-so good parents set off on a hammed-up Hollywood killing-spree, much to the disgust of Glen(da), with a twisted master plan to impregnate the dolefully oblivious Tilly. Blatantly crude, grisly and depraved, Seed of Chucky has something to offend everybody! Hopefully Jennifer Tilly gets sent a flood of great meaty comic roles after this ingeniously dumb performance; at least she probably gets more than Julia Roberts as it is already.",Seed of Chucky

The previous title, 'Bride of Chucky' was not overly bad, so I thought that maybe this film would be perhaps similar or maybe a little better than the previous one.Boy was I wrong.This movie failed on so many levels. The double role of Jennifer Tilly was so stupid in my eyes and the cheesy jokes between herself and Tiffany just made me cringe at how bad it was. You would think that Chuckys child would be a murderous killer like his father, but boy was that not the case. His son/daughter is a massive nerd who doesn't like violence and you just wonder why the hell he is in this movie. As a matter of fact, why was this movie even made. All Don Mancini did was destroy the Chucky franchise. The storyline was very boring, and for me the only thing that saves this movie from a total disaster, is Chucky's funny one liners. The film aspires to be more humorous than scary, because trust me, it ain't scary. If you want to see Chucky masturbating then by all means watch the film, cause that is in there too. Do yourself a favour and go back and watch the original Child's Play movies, because at least in those films the story lines ain't too bad. And if you have already seen the other Chucky films, then watch this to laugh at how bad it is. RIP Chucky franchise.",Seed of Chucky

And how they added the gore into it was perfect. Like when Chucky and Tiffany decapitated that guy and the blood basically rekindled their relationship and they started frickin making out! Some parts are very confusing though. Like how Chuck and Tiffs child Glen/Glenda is no gender and yet Chucky knocked up Jennifer and their kids had a gender. There r outhers that i cant think of right now though.The actors were very good. I also find it ironic that the voice of glen/glenda, Billy Boyd, is in this movie after he worked with Brad Dourif in LOTR. FOr those of u that don't know he was Grima. And lets not forget Jeniffer Tilly the voice of Tiffany now playing herself, which i find humorous as they do a joke about her voice twice.All, in all a good movie that leaves u wanting to know what the hell happened when the credits started rolling and hoping the better come out with the next 1 pretty damn soon.",Seed of Chucky

232,Luckysbicycleworks,.............this is the only Child's Play or Chucky movie I've Seen,6,10 July 2005,"I must say when I was around 8 years old I was really really afraid of Chucky. I remember when I went to go see the movie A Night at the Roxbury I saw a trailer for Bride of Chucky and I was very very frightened. Now 7 years later Seed of Chucky came out on DVD. I bought it and was going to face my fears. Well I watched it and thought to myself....THIS IS Hilarious. I couldn't believe I was ever afraid of a perverted doll. This movie was and wasn't good in my opinion. First off, I want to award Don Mancini. He is a great director but he can't think up the best ideas in the world. A seedling offspring of a doll is a little far-fetched.....but w/e this is Hollywood, they can do whatever they want. I award Mr. Mancini because he didn't use CGI effects at all in this movie. He even says so in the bonus features. I want to be a film director and I took tips from that. Alright now onto the movie. Chucky and Tiffany had a son who doesn't have a name. He thinks he is Chinese and is an orphan. He then hears about the film being made about his parents and hitches a plane ride to Hollywood, California. There we see Jennifer Tilly. I must say that Jennifer Tilly is quite the beautiful woman. She is in the chucky movie and likes to make fun of herself and saying how much better she is than Julia Roberts...which I wouldn't really compare the two woman. Her assistant played by Hannah Spearitt who is even hotter tells Ms. Tilly that Redman.....Redman of all people WHY........is looking for a HOT actress to play The Virgin Mary which isn't really important at all to this movie but of course Ms. Tilly auditions and she whores herself into getting the part. Meanwhile Chucky's son finds his parents and brings them back to life by this Voodoo Curse or w/e. They then wakeup and meet their son. Chucky thinks he is a boy and names him Glen and Tiffany (played by Ms. Gorgeous Tilly) thinks she is a girl so she names her Glenda. They then go to Jennifer Tilly's house and do some Voodoo Ritual in order for Chucky to possess Redman and Tiffany to possess Ms. Tilly. This movie's humor was very very very very dark. Personally this movie shouldn't even be under Horror. This movie is so much more of a comedy. I'm a little surprised as to what happens in the ending. I think everyone has now seen it who wanted to but if u haven't seen it o well I'm spoiling it for you. Basically Jennifer Tilly gets admitted to a hospital and we see Glen/Glenda and Tiffany under her bed and then Chucky pops up out of nowhere....right before he kills Tiffany, Tiffany does the voodoo curse and possess Jennifer's body. Glen/Glenda chops up Chucky and it then flashes to 5 years later. Tiffany possess Tilly's body and she had 2 kids. They are named Glen and Glenda....how awkward...anyways Glen possessed a boy's body and he is Glen. It is his 5th birthday and he has a party at Ms. Tilly's house. Glen then finds out he gets a present from someone with no name. He opens up the box and finds Chucky's arm in it and it supposedly grabs his neck. This ending was terrible because you don't really know what happens...does Chucky come back?? Does Glen die?? Well I guess that is what the 6th movie will be for. I now want to really see Bride of Chucky. I thought that this movie really wasn't that bad but could have been so good. It is what it is and that's it. I hope whoever is reading this liked my review...........bye",Seed of Chucky

So far, I'm LOVING IT! It is so hilarious with just the right amount of gore. I love how their child is gender confused. It's actually realistic in that aspect since some children are indeed born that way. If you wish to have a good laugh I really recommend seeing it. I also recommend seeing it for the sheer factor that Britney Spears gets killed. It doesn't show any gore, however which is quite disappointing. I also recommend seeing Bride of Chucky. This one is just as hilarious, if not more so. After all, not only does Chucky fall in love, he also marries her and has doll sex which is... quite odd to say the least.

234,Shuttles87,Chucky's son goes to find his mom and dad and awakes them on the set of there movie. but His son is terrified by his parents way of life...,1,17 June 2005,"this was the most horrible Chucky movie i have ever seen in my life. it wasn't about Chucky it was more based on his son and how they are different, I was scared once through the hole thing. the story line was so stupid I coulden't stand it another thing would be you only see Chucky kill a couple of people when you have seen him kill a lot more in the past. for these reasons I decided to give this movie a 1 it would have been lower if I could have gone lower. I was very disappointed in this movie and wish I would have never wasted 3.50 on this stupid movie. I would recommend you rent the movie before buying it and making a bigger mistake than I did. thank-you for your time and please take in consideration that my opinions could be different form that of yours",Seed of Chucky
235,gsdisno1,Seed of Chucky is definitely worth watching!,10,10 July 2005,"Seed of Chucky is the best horror movie I have ever seen, and in my opinion, my favorite movie. An example of dark humor. It may also take a little time to understand some of the happenings in this movie. If you're looking for a movie with blood and gore but mostly humor, then Seed of Chucky is the movie for you. Seed of Chucky isn't scary at all, but is an attention catcher especially for the younger generation. In this movie, there is a new addition to the family, and it's name is Glen/Glenda. Whichever name you want to call it since it's gender confused, but I always go with Glen. Believe it or not, but this offspring of Chucky and Tiffany is a really adorable, cute, and well-mannered kid who doesn't want to follow in his dad's footsteps. And did I mention CUTE? But that's not the main idea of this movie. The main idea is that Chucky and Tiffany want to get human bodies for themselves and get Glen one as well. This movie is great and worth watching but then again has blood, gore, sexual content and humor. If you don't like any of that, then I wouldn't suggest watching it. If you've seen the Child's Play movies and didn't like them, that doesn't mean that you won't like this movie, either. These are two totally different movies and I don't see what's wrong with trying to watch this one. I hope you find this comment helpful and get to enjoy this movie.",Seed of Chucky
236,mr-krs-one,Do not watch this movie unless U R a freak,4,2 July 2005,"I rented this movie because I liked the other Chucky movies. So when I came home I was glad to put the movie in my DVD player. The soundtrack was cool too but after that the movie went from bad to worst. I never had thought that they could make such a version of a Chucky movie how could they mess this one up ??? The themes in the movie are very actual but I dislike this themes. A Transsexuals Doll with a messed up mind he thinks he is Japanese and kills humans, A killing doll that reads a kind of ""How Do I Become A Good Person"" book and is a fan of a movie star. A father that wants his kid to become like him. I was much too shocked by the themes expressed to like the movie. Yuckie",Seed of Chucky
237,nicolas_salam,funny not scary,5,27 September 2005,"I liked this movie but it was more comedy than horror and i didn't understand the ending It was OK And i personally thought it would be funnier most of my friends said the same exact thing that i said so, i give it a thumbs up. what was up with the son, was he a girl or a boy and at the end, she kills the nanny with a doll. that is so dumb an d the other girl is she evil or is she chucky in a human body. that is what I don't under stand. I thought that the other chucky movies were so much better and the one that I thought was the scariest was Bride of chucky. If you liked the chuckie movies i recommend jeepers creepers2 and the first one too.",Seed of Chucky
238,mikegsi,Terrible,1,8 September 2017,"The worst movie I think I've ever seen.This movie may be worse than adam sandlers ""Jack and Jill."" This movie was very hard to watch. I have been a huge fan of the Childs Play franchise and I have loved most of the movies, but this movie is an abomination. When the series went from Childs Play to Of Chucky the series has never been the same. I really hope the new movie doesn't end up like this.",Seed of Chucky
239,Midnight_Flight,Awesome.,10,18 December 2005,"This movie was the greatest ever! I would have never ever guessed what happened! I thought it was going to somewhat horror like, but it was completely funny! Tiffany wanting to be Jennifer Tilly, it just funny especially when they say they both have voices, that sound like angels!Awesome! Billy Boy'd made a perfect Glen!! He did so well in the movie I was about to cry through the whole thing. Brad Douif makes the perfect Chucky, I love him so much, he is just the best ever! Redman was so funny as well I didn't want him to die, I would have loved to see him in the next movie! The movie is just great, I can't wait for Child's Play 6!!! I wonder whats going to happen! I can't wait!",Seed of Chucky
