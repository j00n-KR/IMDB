0,Leofwine_draca,Boyle's best by far,7,20 January 2013,"Despite the clichés, this is a fairly effective and gripping thriller from TRAINSPOTTING's Danny Boyle, an edgy film with enough ambiance and shocks to make it worthwhile. Although working on a noticeable low budget (the scene with the car driving past those superimposed air turbines is laughable), Boyle creates an authentic and gritty post-apocalyptic vision which follows through with the shocks in many places that Hollywood wouldn't dare. The opening sequence, in which Cillian Murphy's sole survivor aimlessly wanders through an evacuated London, is especially noteworthy and one of the eeriest moments in a film I've seen in a long time. Although we all know that Boyle achieved his aim by filming early and closing off areas of the city, it works perfectly and nicely sets up the following events which take place in darker, cheaper sets and locations. Shooting on digital video gives the film an added edge of gritty realism especially during the in-your-face zombie attacks.I say zombie because this film is, by all accounts, a straightforward zombie film. The survivors may still be alive but any thought processes are dead and they still attack as ferociously as any of Romero's creations. Boyle gives us some very dark and graphic violence in such attacks, full of sickening spraying blood and chopped limbs shown in quick disturbing flashes. For once the camera doesn't cut away and we're left feeling pretty queasy about it all. But things get worse before they get better, with a climax involving gouged eyes and even worse things happening. One of the problems that this film has is that its extremely bleak and heavy going (at least until the tacked-on ending) and thus may well be off-putting to many viewers who can't stand the too-realistic narrative, which has no time for Hollywood sentimentality.The acting ranges from the solid to the less than impressive, the latter in the case of Megan Burns as the young Hannah. Young child actors are always unwise decisions in adult-orientated films such as this and Burns doesn't quite gel in her role as the unlucky youth. On the other hand, there are some nicely dependable supporting performances, including Naomie Harris as the self-sufficient ex-chemist now turned survivalist, who has brutal ways of dealing with the infected. Brendan Gleeson steals the film with his performance as the warm-hearted father but unfortunately he gets all too little screen time. I have mixed feelings about Cillian Murphy, the relative Irish newcomer who takes the lead. His performance is definitely spot on in places but not at all charismatic, therefore we are unable to identify with him throughout the movie and especially during the gruesome climax.The latter half of the film turns into an open reworking of Romero's classic DAY OF THE DEAD, complete with a chained-up zombie a la Bub and an isolated bunch of soldiers led by a madman – this time played by Christopher Eccleston, giving some gravitas to the proceedings. Although the playout is fairly predictable, there are plenty of scary things going on in the climatic thunderstorm, making for uncomfortable viewing and a fair few jump-in-your-seat shocks for nervous audience goers. As the film generally works as a whole (despite the abundance of ups and downs) I consider it to be a success, although as I mentioned before definitely not to everybody's taste.",28 Days Later...
1,SnoopyStyle,Danny Boyle injects new energy into Zombies,8,1 November 2013,"Without getting into a debate into what a zombie is, there's a virus that's been released that causes rage. A group of animal activists released chimpanzees in a rage experiment. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital. He finds an abandoned London. Also Brendan Gleeson stars as one of the survivors, and Christopher Eccleston as the military squad leader.The team of director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland has given us an exciting, action packed, and eerily atmosphere horror movie. The abandoned cityscape is extremely well done and shocking. The infected run fast and shot in an energetic manic manner. It's very scary to see them coming at the characters. This is all due to the great camera work and editing. After a couple of near misses following his breakouts Trainspotting and Shallow Grave, Boyle re-establishes himself as one of Britain's best.",28 Days Later...
2,Hitchcoc,Scattered,6,18 December 2019,"There are so many films that are like this one. The problem with many is the rules being played by. For me it was how the virus was spread, once the zombies were roaming around. In such a short period of time, how did so much knowledge come forward? And the guy who ran the military compound. How did he put together such an operation in that short time frame? There is lots of action but the chances of the good guys pulling all this off seem quite unlikely. They all end up together and manipulate the horrors, getting them to play off one another. I went into a state of detachment and let the thing cook.",28 Days Later...
3,claudio_carvalho,When 'The Omega Man' and George Romero's Trilogy Are Revisited,8,20 November 2003,"Three activists invade a laboratory with the intention of releasing some monkeys and chimps. What they do not know is that these animals are under experience, infected by the virus of rage. The activists are immediately killed and the animals escape. Twenty-eight days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a comma alone in a abandoned hospital. He leaves the place and finds out that London is desert, apparently without a living soul. Then, he meets Selena (Naomie Harris) and her friend Mark (Noah Huntley) and he is informed that all the population died. People got infected by the monkeys, and the infected ones attacked the survivals. Jim decides to go home with the new friends and see what might have happened with his parents. Then, they are rescued by Frank (Breendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). They listen to a broadcast message from Manchester and they decide to go to the place guided by the broadcasting. . Lots of action happens with the group while trying to escape from mutant zombies.This horror movie is a great entertainment. The story seems to be based on the plot of ""Omega Man"" and parts of the trilogy of George Romero. Fans of these movies will not be disappointed. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Extermínio"" (""Extermination"")",28 Days Later...
4,nogodnomasters,The end is nigh,8,12 November 2019,"Humans are rioting like every day was Black Friday at Walmart. A group of do-gooders lets an infected chimp loose that has the ""Rage"" virus which causes people to go berserk and kill uninfected people only. The effect is immediate and the virus has wiped out New York from London in 28 days. Go figure.Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma and needs a Pepsi product placement. He ends up with two other people as they travel to a military base which was not the paradise he expected. This is not a zombie movie per se, but an infected person film. They don't take headshots to kill and I wonder why they haven't raised the grocery stores.Guide: F-word. Nudity (Cillian Murphy + infected people)",28 Days Later...
5,kosmasp,Walk like a (romero) zombie,7,10 October 2007,"Well not really, but that's not the point, I was trying to make. I just thought of the song, walk like an Egyptian and considering the pace of the zombies on hand here, I mixed it with that. i hope that was somehow clear enough, for everyone to understand! If not just ask/write me! But back to the movie, that has two obvious Romero nods (the grocery store scene, a ""special"" zombie, which reminds fans of ""Bub"" (""Day of the Dead"") and more or less the complete third act, which also looks like a ""Day of the Dead"" nod). And maybe some more, but not that apparent. The horror scenes are good, especially the beginning with it's images that might haunt you for a while (London, like you've never seen it).",28 Days Later...
6,Sleepin_Dragon,An out and out classic.,8,23 September 2016,"I've mentioned several times about my list of favourite horror movies, and this one is very much on the list. In someone it's a beautiful movie, with some truly powerful, almost iconic scenes of an empty London, abandoned motorways etc, a soundtrack that would grace any film, and some great characters, all somehow realistic and subtle. The story is quite common place, but it's what accompanies it is what makes it unique, an unashamedly huge amount of Britishness, we get Union Jacks, London cabs and buses, even Trafalgar Square. Plenty of scares, great character play, lots of long dialogues which are far from dull and a fantastic ending. A classic, full of depth. 8/10",28 Days Later...
7,gavin6942,A Tightrope Between Matheson and Walking Dead,7,17 March 2007,"After waking up from a coma, a man named Jim (Cillian Murphy) discovers that the entire city of London and maybe the world has been taken over by a virus that causes people to go into a rage. Now, he is left with only two things to do: find others like himself and learn to survive.This film can be seen as a tightrope connecting ""I Am Legend"" (any version you want) and ""The Walking Dead"". Like the former, you have one man alone against a world of post-human monsters in an evacuated large city. He is looking for a cure, or at least a way to survive, and he finds a female companion to share the journey. The differences between the films are relatively minor in the context of the overall plot.And then we have the latter. While the ""Walking Dead"" comic or television series could be compared to any zombie apocalypse film, it again features one man alone in a big city (Rick in Atlanta as opposed to Jim in London). Most notably, both start in a hospital. Major West could also be compared to the Governor. This may be a coincidence, or it may be an homage -- according to Robert Kirkman, he had the comic plotted out before he had seen this film.We are given this horrific vision by director Danny Boyle (best known at this point for ""Trainspotting"" before getting even bigger with ""Slumdog Millionaire""), and he does a fine job. By saying this film takes elements from predecessors, it may sound like I am being condescending or trying to sell the film short. I am not. Boyle does a wonderful job of showing a desolate city, a man isolated in London (the last place he would expect to be alone) and people infected with the rage virus. Much of horror cinema is not so much being original (a very, very rare thing these days) but taking a well-trod archetype and making it your own.One brave decision that was made was the casting of no-name actors, or at least no actors that stand out for Americans (this is before the ""Doctor Who"" franchise took off in the States). Any name actor (such as, say, Leonardo DiCaprio as was rumored) would distract from the grand vision, I feel. It shifts the focus from the story of all humanity to the story of one man. Interestingly, Cillian Murphy has since become a huge star in his own right -- watching the film now (2013) is different than when it first came out because of this.The heart of the film is Brendan Gleeson, who plays Frank. It takes it from a horror or survival film to a story of the goodness of humanity. The saying that sometimes the worst brings out the best in people is exemplified in Frank. His good nature and altruism shine and have a positive effect on those around him.Many consider this a ""zombie"" film, while others try to differentiate it from that group (Boyle himself has called it a zombie film). I think there is a distinct difference between a virus that affects the living and the walking dead (even when the walking dead are brought back by a virus). This is, really, just a tale of survival that could have been portrayed similarly as rabies or AIDS. This is another way the film is influential; hundreds of zombie films have come out over the past decade (most of which are terrible), but the rise of the ""infection"" film owes its genesis to ""28 Days Later"".The only real complaint is the suspension of disbelief we have to have about Jim's beginnings. Waking up from a coma that he was in for at least three weeks, he is able to run easily without muscle atrophy or fatigue. He also survived in a hospital where no one else did. And most amazing of all, he seems to have not urinated or defecated in the bed. But all horror and science fiction films require a little bit of magic, so I think we can mark this off as being in that category.The film is heavy on the survival aspects, moderate on the action, moderate on the gore by ""zombie"" standards. And very light on the romance, which I am pleased about (that is one advantage it has over ""Omega Man""). The film is all about trying to make it out alive, and that is something I can see more of -- ""survival horror"". While I would not recommend seeing this until after seeing ""Omega Man"" and ""Last Man on Earth"" just to put it in perspective, this is a very good addition to the line of films coming out with these themes.",28 Days Later...
8,lee_eisenberg,infection of society,10,23 April 2016,"Danny Boyle has made a name for himself over the past twenty years with movies like ""Trainspotting"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""127 Hours"". But ""28 Days Later"" is also worth checking out. It's not a zombie movie in the general sense. Rather it's a look at what could happen to society if every person were allowed to unleash his/her deepest, darkest emotions. In this case, a rage-causing virus decimates the UK's population, leaving only a few people alive. While there is a lot of gore, the emphasis remains on the characters. Probably the thing that makes the movie especially unique is what we eventually find out about the troops.Boyle said that he took some inspiration from ""Day of the Triffids"". Watching the movie I could see the similarity. I also got the feeling that ""Contagion"" and ""World War Z"" took some inspiration from this movie. Most importantly, this is one movie that you have to see. I have a feeling that if a virus wiped out most of the population leaving only a few people, those few people would REALLY have to hustle to figure out how to survive.I recommend it.",28 Days Later...
9,jboothmillard,28 Days Later...,8,3 November 2005,"Danny Boyle, director of Shallow Grave, Trainspotting and The Beach, returned to the horror genre (after Shallow Grave) with a very scary and realistic story about survival. In a secret laboratory, a deadly virus has infected monkeys, and when they escape and spill their blood, humans turn like them, they become really angry maniacs, or the infected (zombies). 28 days later... (after the virus has spread) Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in empty London, it looks like he's the only one left. He soon discovers that a few others are left alive after the evacuation, not all successful. Along with Selena (Pirates of the Caribbean's Naomie Harris), Hannah (Megan Burns), Mark (Noah Huntley, briefly) and Frank (Brendan Gleeson, briefly), they all head to a secured location where there is apparently a way to stop the virus. But there is much more than that going on.

It was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",28 Days Later...
10,Woodyanders,Beware of the infected ... and your fellow humans,8,11 January 2018,"While this film didn't exactly reinvent the zombie horror genre, director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland nonetheless still manage to bring a feeling of jarring intimacy and immediacy to the standard premise by wisely focusing on a small handful of survivors who try to stay alive and retain residual traces of their humanity in an extremely dire and desperate situation. Indeed, Boyle and Garland handle the premise with admirable take-no-prisoners grim seriousness by showing in stark and chilling terms how easily people can degenerate into a horrible barbaric state in the wake of civilization collapsing. In an inspired cynical touch, a group of soldiers turn out to be anything but heroic and helpful as they prove to be more concerned with their own self-preservation over helping others out. Cillian Murphy makes for an engaging average guy protagonist as the fundamentally decent Jim, Noamie Harris provides plenty of spark as the sassy and ruthlessly determined Selena, Brandon Gleeson does typically fine work as affable cab driver Frank, and Christopher Eccleston likewise excels as the steely Major Henry West. A tense sequence in a tunnel rates as a definite harrowing highlight while the shots of a dead quiet and empty London are quite eerie and striking. Anthony Dod Mantle's rough digital cinematography gives this picture a gritty sense of documentary-style realism. But it's the way this film manages to keep things on a basic human level which in turn makes the horror presented herein so potent and unsettling.",28 Days Later...

12,BA_Harrison,Danny Boyle should make more horror.,9,19 May 2010,"Twenty-eight days after a powerful virus known as 'rage' escapes from an animal experimentation lab, injured cycle courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes from a coma to discover that, while he has been asleep, the country has been overwhelmed by the infected, who are crazed, bloodthirsty, and surprisingly fleet of foot.Although I'm not the biggest fan of Danny Boyle's oeuvre as a whole, I do love me a good zombie film, and 28 Days Later is one of the finest examples that the genre has to offer (OK, I know that they are not technically zombies, but as poet James Whitcomb Riley once wrote, ""when I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck).Not only does the film offer intense horror by the bucket-load, but it also manages to deliver heart-rending pathos, dark comedy and nail-biting action, thanks to a raft of central characters you actually give a damn about, a gripping script from Alex Garland that wisely keeps matters within the realms of believability, and Boyle's stylish direction that combines stunning cinematography (considering the digital format on which it was shot) with frantic, hand-held footage of the type that often sends me into fits of rage myself, but which works brilliantly in this instance. Also adding immensely to the overall atmosphere is the excellent original music by John Murphy, which works particularly well in the early scene in which Jim wanders the deserted streets of London, the score building to a crescendo as he gradually comes to understand his predicament.I know it's highly unlikely, now that Boyle has snagged himself Academy Award for Best Director, but I reckon the guy should tackle more horror (but NOT sci-fi/horror: Sunshine sucked!).",28 Days Later...
13,moonspinner55,"Which is the bigger nightmare: raging, flesh-eating zombies or human beings out of control?",6,25 February 2011,"When animal activists in London set free a laboratory chimp infected with a deadly virus, they unwittingly unleash a plague that consumes the entire planet. A small group of Britishers who have survived the apocalypse hear a radio transmission from the military and decide to risk the three-day drive to an Army outpost in Manchester, though not without consequence: marauding zombies who feast on the living are socked away everywhere, ready to attack. Suspenseful horror film with an astounding artistic eye, courtesy director Danny Boyle, though with a frenetic, action-packed finale which releases much of the suspense and tension built up in the first two-thirds of the picture. Still quite an extraordinary achievement, particularly for the over-crowded and overly-familiar end-of-the-world movie genre. Followed by a 2007 sequel, ""28 Weeks Later"", which featured a different cast and Boyle as co-producer. **1/2 from ****",28 Days Later...
14,paul_haakonsen,A rude awakening...,6,20 January 2016,"""28 Days Later"" does deviate somewhat from the stereotypical zombie movie genre. And whether or not that is a good thing or a bad thing is, of course, a matter of personal preference. I did, however, find it to be a refreshing approach to the genre. I liked some parts of the movie, and I disliked others.Director Danny Boyle took a bold approach to the genre when he came up with this zombie movie or viral infection movie, call it what you will. And it was an approach that resulted in a fairly entertaining movie, which did bring some new and interesting things to the genre.What works in favor of ""28 Days Later"" is the storyline and the way that director Danny Boyle told the story. It is a fast paced story that is driven by a solid story, good characters and equally good acting performances.However, I am not personally a big fan of having fast, agile and running zombies. But since these aren't zombies as such, then I guess as an infected person it is alright. But for the genre, then I would classify them as zombies, and as such running is a no go.I mentioned that the storyline is good, and it is the heart of the story, and the writers did put together a good story which is thrilling and entertaining. It was a thrill ride to follow Jim (played by Cillian Murphy) from waking up in the hospital and throughout the movie right up to the end.The effects in ""28 Days Later"" are quite good, and that is something which also helps the movie quite a lot. You can't really have a zombie movie, infected people movie, or whatever this was, and not have proper effects. So thumbs up to the special effects team for their work on ""28 Days Later"".Usually I am not one who pays much attention to music in a movie, unless it is awfully bad and overshadows everything else. But the music they opted for in this movie was actually good and did help to supplement the movie quite well.If you enjoy zombie movies and want something fast paced that deviates from the stereotypical how-to-make-a-zombie-movie recipe, then give ""28 Days"" a chance.",28 Days Later...
15,Quinoa1984,one of the best European horror films this decade,10,16 August 2003,"The key to keeping the sci-fi horror genre alive in the cinemas, as of late, is to make sure the material and techniques the filmmakers present is at least competent, at it's average creative, and at it's best something that we haven't seen before or haven't seen in such a style or form. George A. Romero did that back in prime 60s and 70s era of film-making, bringing forth one of the most memorable trilogies of all time for the genre. While many consider Romero to be on any given list one of the greatest horror directors (I included), it is important to know that he too had his sources for his little independent film in 1968, and after that was when he really got inventive, resulting in a masterpiece and a lackluster. Director Danny Boyle and author Alex Garland know that if they were to cook up a yarn all too similar to Romero it wouldn't be satisfying. So, they've done what is essential to the success of 28 Days Later- they take ideas that have been in practice for many years, turn them fresh, and as the audience we feel repelled, excited, terrified, nauseous (perhaps), and enthralled, but we won't leave feeling like we've seen complete hack work. What does Boyle and his team set out to do to freshen up the zombie string? By making not in precise terms a ""zombie"" movie- you never hear ""living-dead"" uttered in this film, although you do hear ""infected"" and a new word for what these people have, ""rage"". Indeed, this is what the infected have in Britain, when a monkey virus gets let loose on the Island, and from the beginning of the infectious spread the film cuts to a man, Jim, lying in a hospital bed, who wanders abandoned streets and views torn fragments of society in front of him. That Boyle implements atmosphere as heavily as he does with the action/chase scenes gives an indication of his dedication to the detail. Jim soon finds a few other survivors, including Selena (Naomie Harris) and a father and his daughter (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns) who hear of salvation on a radio and decide to brave it out to find it. When they do, it's a military outpost that's without any true salvation, outside of the various military typos. Like in Boyle and producer Andrew MacDonald's spellbinding (if that's the proper terminology) adaptation of Trainspotting, the craft is on par (or arguably topping) with the story and characters, and thus it has to captivate us all the more so to care about the plight of Jim and his companions. The photography by Anthony Dod Mantle is striking, not the least of which since it was done on digital photography (like in Blair Witch, the use of non-professional camera equipment adds the proper shading when needed), but also many of the shot compositions are different for such a film. The editing by Chris Gill goes quicker than expected in the attack scenes, going so fast between the infected throwing up blood, the screaming on-looker; the new infected transforming within seconds, and then the results that follow. Mark Tildesley's production design, as well as John Murphy's music, evokes haunting, evocative moods even in the more mundane scenes. And the acting, considering not many of the actors are well-known, is more than believable for such a script. I'm not sure if 28 Days Later will be everyone's cup of tea. Some of the horror and science fiction fans out there will immediately hear of this film, see a preview or a TV ad, or even see it, and dismiss it as phooey rubble borrowed from the video-store. I can see their points of view, since I saw many similarities in Romero and some other films (the military scenes reminded me of Day of the Dead, though the chained up Zombie in this was done for more practical reasons, and the supermarket scene is a little unneeded considering the satirical reverence it had in Dawn of the Dead). But what they should understand is that Boyle isn't making a 100% original film, and no one could at this point of the genre's history. He has done, however, the most credible job he could in getting a different tone, a different setting in country, and of a different, enveloping view of the scene structures. Overall, 28 Days Later is constructed and executed like most sci-fi horror films you've ever seen, and like not many other sci-fi horror films you've ever seen combined, in a sense, for a modern audience: fascinating throughout.",28 Days Later...

17,Coventry,"Uneven horror film, but with occasional flashes of sheer brilliance",5,3 February 2005,"Back in good old Great Britain, Danny Boyle proves that he's still a gifted filmmaker even though his short Hollywood career wasn't as fruitful as initially hoped for. The opening sequences of this ""28 Days Later"" are downright astonishing and  for a moment  you suspect that you're about to watch to most brilliant horror film in a long, long time. Especially the already classic sequence in which Jim (Cillian Murphy) wanders through the entirely deserted streets of the otherwise so lively and crowded London, guided by disturbing music, is efficiently creepy. The plot centers on an extremely aggressive virus that turns people into blood-crazed maniacs. It's only 28 days since the virus was unleashed and the entire population is wiped away already, while a few lonely survivors desperately prepare for the total apocalypse. Jim is one of them, as he just awoke from a coma, completely unaware of the vile events that took place the past 28 days Even though the story isn't very original (Romero's ""The Crazies"" come to mind as well as ""Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man""), Danny Boyle succeeds in portraying a gripping mix of drama, action, suspense and  oh yes  gore! Now, I really wished I could end my user comment here and conclude that ""28 Days Later"" was a simply great new horror film but unfortunately the script takes a complete U-turn halfway and becomes a repetitive lesson in which Boyle and writer Alex Garland try to convince us that mankind still remains the biggest threat of all. The last survivors end up at a military post where their lives are even in bigger danger. The tension and carefully built up atmosphere disappears and is replaced by tedious macho speeches and gratuitous brutality. The acting performances in this film aren't very spectacular but that's understandable considering most cast-members are debuting here. The fact that this project was entirely filmed with digital cameras might be a nice trivia element, but I'm not too keen on this type of cinematography. Overall, Boyle's film is worthy viewing for horror fans but experienced fanatics won't be too impressed.",28 Days Later...

19,hitchcockthelegend,It started off as rioting. But right from the beginning you knew this was different...,9,11 October 2011,"28 Days Later is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. It stars Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Megan Burns, Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Ecclestone. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.When animal liberation activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Center, they come across a scientist who tells them that to release these chimps would be insane. They have been injected with a test serum known as ""Rage"", and it's highly contagious and spreads easily and quickly. Ignoring the warnings, one of the activists opens a cage and is attacked and bitten by a chimp and rage quickly spreads among the group...28 days later...The amazing thing with Danny Boyles's 28 Days later is that although it owes a huge debt to the likes of George Romero's zombie films, and John Wyndham and Richard Matheson's writings, it still feels fresh and exciting. Film is quintessentially British, as evidenced by the rightly lauded use of a depopulated London for the starting point to the terror, yet there's an earthiness to our small band of survivors. These are flawed characters that are ill equipped to deal with the infected implosion, there's nothing remotely Hollywood about these people or the landscapes that frame them (CG is minimal, where hand-held digital cameras are the order of the day).There's a realistic feel factor that is rarely seen in other films of this ilk. Yep, sure there's implausibilities, but with the infected creatures running at a fair old clip, becoming scary creations in a stark stripped back land, there's too much fun being had - and nervous tension being burnt - to even begin to start nit-picking. Besides, the last quarter alone is a lesson in energy fuelled horror as the survivors, having seemingly found a safe house, find that monsters aren't merely confined to the infected human kind. It's a cracker-jack of a finale, bloody and bloody frantic, all backed by Murphy's simple but totally potent musical arrangements.It's easy to see why America made it a monster hit at the box office, after just making a small profit in the UK, film went to America and made it big. Americans, you have to feel, enjoyed watching something raw in a sub-genre of horror that was at the time reliant on Romero rediscovering his mojo. Worldwide the film made over $70 million in profit, and those are the kinds of figures that speak volumes. The success ensured a sequel would follow, where Boyle and Garland bowed out of the main chairs and into producers roles for ""28 Weeks Later"". It's not as raw as ""Days"", but it's gorier and itself also a fine ""infected"" horror movie, and certainly a worthy follow up to what Boyle and Garland clinically created in 2002.A great cast and premise get down and dirty In a sharply executed infected based horror. 8.5/10",28 Days Later...
20,Theo Robertson,Very Good In Places But Ultimately Unconvincing,7,20 October 2004,"Long before I watched 28 DAYS LATER I had an online conversation with a couple of my cyber friends Jeremy and Riquez . Jeremy praised the movie thinking it was one of the best film releases in several years . I did point out to him the ridiculous idea that a virus with an incubation period of 20 seconds wouldn't be able to cause the type of havoc as featured in the movie . Riquez contributed to the conversation by saying "" Theo you have no problem with rabid zombies but you find a virus with an incubation period of 20 seconds ridiculous ! "" After finally seeing 28 DAYS LATER ( Thanks for the video Robin ) my reservations were confirmed , the audience can quite happily accept the concept of raging psychos tearing up the country destroying all in their path but the thought put into small details spoils the film somewhat !!!!! SPOILERS !!!!! Most of the problems lie in Alex Garland's script , it lacks depth , logic and internal continuity . Take for example the line where Selena tells Jim that the apocalypse was caused by something in the blood . How would she know this ? This is an example of characters knowing what's happening because the screenwriter does which is a mistake on Alex Garland's part . The reverse is also very true with characters being unable to work out things the audience has . Before seeing the movie I did have online conversations on the message board that a virus that takes 20 seconds to turn people into zombies wouldn't be able to spread world wide , indeed this is central to the plot and Sgt Farrell does state that "" How does the infection spread across the oceans , mountains and rivers ? "" and yet he's the only character in the story to draw this very obvious conclusion that only mainland Britain has been struck by rage . It would have been far less obvious if Selena and others had been totally ignorant as to the mechanics of infection As for the gaps in logic ask yourself this: If the soldiers want to keep Selena and Hannah as sex slaves why didn't they murder Jim as soon as they saw him ? I guess if they did we wouldn't have a story , but the screenplay is full of these niggling problems , like Jones and Mitchell getting into a fight so Jim can escape or West and Davies going to the barricade to kill Jim when they've got everything they need ( ie Selena and Hannah ) at the house . There's no reason for the soldiers to care about killing JimI also had a problem with the characterisation . Selena is shown as being tough as nails and totally ruthless at the start of the story and then needs rescuing by Jim at the end . Compare her to characters in say a John Christopher story where the protagonist starts off as middle class and mild mannered and ends up having to kill to survive . This is what happens to Jim but it seems a totally ridiculous character arc as he wipes out West's platoon . Jim has spent a month in a coma , has no military experience and manages to beat some squaddies who not only managed to survive mass attacks of the infected but had considerable battle experience before rage . I'm telling you Saddam must be kicking himself about not recruiting any bicycle couriers into the Iraqi army I will absolve Garland of any blame for the bizarre upbeat ending where Jim survives a bullet wound to the stomach and lives happily ever after with Selena and Hannah since the studio demanded a happy ending for their audience . Let's be honest here , the only ending that would have made sense is Jim dying and the two girls facing an uncertain future with rage turning into a pandemic holocaust I don't want to give the impression that I hated 28 DAYS LATER . I liked it a lot and will praise director Danny Boyle for making a tense and often very thrilling film . The use of digital video succeeds and the cinematography is breath taking especially the scenes set at the rain drenched roadblock where you can almost see every single raindrop falling pass the screen . The casting is somewhat uneven ( The French foreign legion isn't that cosmopolitan never mind the British army ) but mention must go to Ricci Harnett as Cpl Mitchell who plays one of cinema's most memorable thugs in a long time , Leo Bill might give an irritating performance as Jones but that's the way he's written , Naomie Harris is impressive where she's not let down by the script and the only real disappointment is Christopher Ecclestone as Major West who seems slightly miscast I gave 28 DAYS LATER seven out of ten but to be honest this should have been so much better . One can't help thinking Boyle would have been better off filming an adaptation of John Christopher's THE DEATH OF GRASS . As it stands it's a very good example of if a film is good it's because of the director . If it's bad it's because of the screenwriter",28 Days Later...
21,preppy-3,Disturbing,8,28 June 2003,"A man named Mark wakes up in a deserted hospital in London. He wanders outside finding no sign of people at all. It seems a plague (transmitted by blood) has turned most of the population into flesh-eating, fast moving zombies. Mark finds a few more uninfected people and they struggle to survive.I expected a gore fest on the order of ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"". That's not what I got. There is some extreme violence (including a little bit at the end that I'm surprised got by with an R rating) but not a lot and it comes in short bursts. This story concentrates on the characters and their moods and actions. And, for once, they act just like you would expect people to act in such a situation. Also attention is paid to such things as electricity, water supply, food etc etc which other movies like this totally ignore. But it is depressing and, at the end, extremely disturbing. This isn't a movie you really enjoy...you just appreciate it for how well it's done. Also it was shot in muted color on video which just adds to the feeling of helplessness. It does have some very scary scenes...these zombies move VERY quickly (they're shot in fast motion), the attack scenes have blood gushing out and there's an extremely eerie sequence inside a tunnel. Also the acting is uniformly good especially by Cillian Murphy (who also has a very lengthy nude scene at the beginning) and Naomie Harris as strong, tough Selena. Like director Danny Boyle's other films (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, A Life Less Ordinary) I like this with reservations. I'm recommending it but only for those with strong stomaches.",28 Days Later...

23,poolandrews,Dull horror.,6,16 May 2006,"28 Days Later... starts as three animal activists break into 'Cambridge Primate Research Center' & deliberately set loose some caged monkeys, unfortunately unknown to them these monkeys are infected with a highly contagious 'rage' virus which turns the carrier into a ravenous crazy red-eyed zombies... Jump forward '28 Days Later' & Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital bed from a coma, he discovers the hospital & central London completely deserted. Jim is attacked by some of the infected & is saved by Mark (Noah Huntley) & Selena (Naomie Harris) who inform Jim that the entire country has been overrun by infected people who do nothing but kill & spread the virus. Survival is hard & Mark is killed when he becomes infected, with just Jim & Selena left they meet a man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) & his young daughter Hannah (Megan Burns) who are also having trouble surviving in London. While trying to listen to the radio they hear a message from a group of soldiers just outside Manchester, the four decide to try & find them & seek help & shelter...This English French co-production was directed by Danny Boyle & I thought it was OK at best & excruciatingly dull at worst. The script by Alex Garland takes itself 100% seriously & is slow, isn't properly fleshed out & dull. The film felt like it was hours long & it took me three attempts to get through it over two days as it just wasn't holding my interest at all. I hated all the character's, I hated way it was shot, I hated the story & I hated the fact it rips off so many better horror films right down to individual scenes from the likes of The Day of the Trffids (1962) where Jim wakes up in hospital facing a post apocalyptic world, Dawn of the Dead (1978) with the shopping center bit & the zombie kid & Day of the Dead (1985) with the chained up zombie, there are loads more besides. Not enough information about the virus or zombie sis given, in fact we learn virtually nothing about either. The film failed to excite me on any level, I simply didn't care what happened which is why I wasn't bothered about seeing it in one go. For most of the film Jim is passive & rather static until the end when he suddenly turns into a bare chested superhero & takes out an entire army platoon on his own & avoids all the infected zombies running around everywhere, it's far too clichéd & is just a totally unconvincing change in his character. The happy 'Hollywood' ending is also hard to swallow, where exactly did that plane come from? It's only Britian that is infected? It states early in the film that the virus had spread to Paris & New York, if the rest of the world was still 'OK' I cannot believe for the life of me that a highly trained platoon of soldiers wouldn't have radio equipment to contact the outside world, I mean if my cheap mobile can call the opposite side of the world surely they had the equipment to radio for help or at least know that other countries were infection free. After the end credits had finished on the version I saw it said 'What If...' which turns out to be an alternative ending in which Selena & Hannah try to save Jim's life in a hospital but fail & just walk off, this is a slightly more realistic downbeat ending that some may prefer while other's may not. Having said that it's well made & it's watchable on a basic level but it could have been so much better.Director Boyle does his best to ruin the thing, it was shot on a digital camera so it looks grubby & cheap while he totally messes up the horror scenes, why do directors use really fast cuts? You know the sort of thing, scenes which are just annoying hand-held jerky camera movements, a jumble of jump cuts & individual shots that last for less then a second which confuses, frustrates & doesn't allow the audience to see anything. A lot of films are guilty of it & I really don't know why, I don't know a single person who says they like this particular editing technique, not one so why filmmakers continue to use it in abundance I'll never know. Forget about any effective gore as it's blink & you'll miss it stuff because of the fast editing, the most you can make out is some spurting blood. The early scenes set in a deserted London have a certain effective eeriness to them but that's as good as 28 days Later... gets.With a supposed budget of about $8,000,000 28 Days Later... is well made for what it is but it's not that stylish. The acting from a largely unknown cast is OK but I absolutely hated all the character's in the thing which made it impossible to like the film or care about them.28 Days Later... was hugely disappointing, I was expecting a lot but I felt let down in every area. I will still give it a decent score as it's OK but there are just too many things about it I didn't like. Worth a watch but just don't expect a masterpiece.",28 Days Later...

Danny Boyle has created a wonderful horror classic that takes you into new territory just when you've begun to think you've seen it all before.The first half of this film is some of the best horror film making of the last twenty years or so. Simply put a man wakes up from a coma to find the world in ruins and most of the world now blood thirsty monsters. Staggering around England he ends up with a group of people who try to get out of the city to a safe place in the country. Filled with great set pieces this part of the film raises your expectations for a bang up second half and the genre itself.Unfortunately the military arrive and things shift gears as the movie becomes something else. Its not a totally bad change, what happens is quite good, but after a first half t which effectively rewrites the rules of the genre we get a tale that seems like we've been there and done that. The flight to the countryside becomes literally housebound and it stagnates in ideas that are good but which we've already seen.That said, see this movie.

It takes the horror and zombie movies to a new era and already film-makers are starting taking over the movie its style of film-making and approach with its story and concept.""28 Days Later..."" is very original, even though its not. I mean, basically very little original is in the story and the movie actually 'borrows' a lot from much earlier genre movies. Yet ""28 Days Later..."" could and should be regarded as a totally original genre, mostly due to its approach.Leave it up to director Danny Boyle to deliver a good movie with also lots of style and originality. This movie does not pick a classic horror approach in which our main heroes are running from the evil killer zombies, the story is much more layered than that and there are some deeper meanings to the story. For instance in the second halve it becomes apparent that perhaps not the infected are the worst and most dangerous villains around but mankind is actually much more vicious and evil some under circumstances. This is also why I really liked the second halve of the movie, even though it was quite different from the first halve of the movie. I always like movies that completely turn 180 degrees after they are halve way through, at least if its done in a good manner of course.The movie its approach is totally realistic, which also can be seen back in the movie its gritty and dynamic camera-work and the way the overall story progresses and the characters are being developed. I'm also pretty sure that this movie shows an accurate portrayal of the case when an actual epidemic such as this would break out on a large scale. Nothing in this movie ever makes you think; oh that's really not possible or believable! Even though the movie of course features brain dead murderous 'zombies'.But hardened horror fans don't worry. The movie still features plenty of gore and graphic killings for you to enjoy. This movie welcomes a new group of people to the genre but at the same time knows to maintain and please the 'old fashioned' horror-lovers.The movie is also good looking with its settings, which truly enhances the movie its atmosphere. There is nothing scarier than watching a completely deserted London.There are some fine actors in the movie that are all giving some fine and realistic performances. Cillian Murphy can basically play anything and it was this movie that marked his big breakthrough. I'm not a too big fan of Naomie Harris but she is simply good in this movie and plays her role very natural and therefor credible. Further more Brendan Gleeson also plays a fine smaller role. Megan Burns on the other hand is just downward horrible. Pure and simply, she just can't act. It seriously ruins some of the realism and tension of the movie at times. Thank goodness she also hasn't acted in anything every since. Casting her was basically the biggest mistake this movie made.It's already a classic within its genre.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",28 Days Later...
27,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The world can end in a heartbeat,8,17 July 2010,"This is intense right off the bat. We are quickly given the backstory, and then we wake up in abandoned, post-apocalyptic UK. The atmosphere and tension grow as we realize what the situation is. While the third act is unexpected and different from(not worse than, mind you) the first two, this is excellent throughout. It is a long trip down a dark tunnel with the occasional crack that lets in a little light, without removing the fear that you won't make it out. This focuses on a small group of characters, and uses that well, developing them and the relationships between them, letting us connect to them. The acting is great; Murphy throws himself at this and explores a wide range of emotional states. This doesn't overstimulate the viewer, but it does come pretty close, as it is rather bleak. The pace is even, and this isn't moves smoothly. Not always fast(well, the story does), but there is a constant real sense of threat and danger. This is one of the three times Garland and Boyle work together(The Beach and Sunshine), and they compliment each other well each time. The energetic visual style of Danny has your eyes glued to the screen, and this, shot on DV(for a grainy, ""authentic"" picture quality... except for a flashback, that they used Super 8 for... brilliant) puts you right in the situations with hand-held and dynamic cinematography(and the Infected are filmed in a specific manner, rendering them far creepier). This was on a budget, and they faced their limitations, not taking on anything they couldn't accomplish. If you don't know, you can't really tell that this was looking like they might not have enough money to complete it. The music tends to fit the mood where it is used. There is a little humor, and the dialog is natural and well-written. This is psychologically accurate. As this kind of movie ought to, this brings up some philosophical ideas and isn't just about ""boy, don't you hope these people live"". It was smart of them to choose vira as the source, as those are scary today, and the concept here is a mental, not physical, change. They applied a lot of research about people in extremis. Is this a zombie flick? Depends on how strict your definition of that is. It's changed(have you seen one from before Romero began his trilogy?) before. You could call it a reinterpretation of them, or action/survival horror. There is a lot of disturbing content, a bit of blood and violence(little gore or brutality to it, and it mostly isn't as direct as is often the case today), a moderate amount of strong language in this and brief male nudity including full frontal. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it. 8/10",28 Days Later...

In spite of the dire and stressed warning of the scientist on hand, they released one of the chimps and then all hell broke loose. I wonder what the message there was? Anyway, 28 days later a guy wakes up in an empty hospital to find out that absolutely no one is around.This is, by far, the best zombie (or zombie-like) movie I've ever seen. A different yet interesting take on the whole zombie idea. There weren't leagues of zombies crawling all over the place leaving hardly any place to hide, instead they were scattered and largely hidden. Plus, I like the idea that they weren't dead, just infected, so know limbless or severely maimed dead people motoring around looking for brains or flesh to eat. And no head shots necessary to kill the zombies/infected.I guess what I liked most about the movie was the sign of hope that was present. With the other zombie movies I've watched the zombies are all walking dead; which is to say, since they are already dead they aren't going to effectively die again unless a bullet is put in their head. There are only so many bullets and the somnambulists seem limitless. In this movie there was the very real possibility of life continuing, or better still, a cure being found because it was a disease after all.This was an excellent movie leaving very little to beef about. I especially liked Naomie Harris' character (Selena). She was tough and non-cliché. The moment she suspected her accomplice had been infected she proceeded to chop him up with reckless abandon. Although she did partake in the ultra-cliché passionate-kiss-while-still-in-danger later on in the movie. There was also a good sub plot with the precarious position Jim (Cillian Murphy), Selena, and Hannah (Megan Burns) were put in with the British army. Here it is, they finally believe they are safe once they are amongst the army and away from the carnivorous infected, but they jumped out of the pan and into the fire. They escaped the blood thirsty infected to the sex hungry army.""28 Days Later"" is a new and interesting spin on zombies worthy of merit. With this new version of zombie there is a greater vulnerability of being zombized (just see how Frank was infected in the most astronomically infinitesimal way), but on the other hand there is a greater hope of survival.

29,evanston_dad,Decent Idea....Not Very Good Movie,4,29 April 2005,"""28 Days Later"" would be a much better movie if the film makers had known what story they wanted to tell. As it is, they start with a high-concept apocalyptic plague premise that degenerates into a slap-dash, jumbled action movie. I suppose Danny Boyle and screenwriter are trying to make the idea of people being infected with rage relevant to our current troubled world state (the film begins with an image of multiple T.V. monitors each showing news footage of one violent action or another), but I think they are much more taken with the idea of making a gross-out movie that will appeal to the alternative grunge crowd, not realizing that grunge is now cliché. What is supposed to feel cutting edge feels stale and like something you've seen done before and done better. The movie gets kudos from me for its visual look, and I do admit that it's never boring, but there's a general feeling of senseless nastiness that negates any message you're going to get from this.Grade: C",28 Days Later...

So he ventures into the street and finds the entire city of London deserted. Or so he thinks.

Suddenly, even more begin to attack him and he is rescued in the nick of time by ""Mark"" (Noah Huntley) and ""Selena"" (Naomi Harris). Taking him to a safe haven they explain the viral epidemic which has taken over Great Britain and left the three of them terribly out-numbered. At any rate, rather than giving all of the details to this movie, I will just say that this is a first rate zombie film. Both Noah Huntley and Naomi Harris do an outstanding job as does the director, Danny Boyle. Now, I fully understand that there are a couple of differences with these zombies which contrast with the more traditional view. For starters, these zombies don't stumble along like ""normal"" zombies. They run. Very fast. They also don't seem to need the mandatory ""headshot"" that ""normal"" zombies require. Claymore mines and machine guns seem to do the trick quite nicely. Likewise, while they attack humans, I didn't see them feasting on human flesh so much. But that may have been understood and therefore considered unnecessary to show. Additionally, their ability to infect humans is much faster than usual. Sometimes as quickly as 10 seconds. So in that respect there isn't much response time or waiting around. Still, all things considered I really liked this movie and I think most zombie fans will too.",28 Days Later...

It is similar to the David Cronenberg film Rabid, with references to the rapture. Activists break into an animal testing lab to free the chimpanzees. A lab assistant pleads that the chimps are infested with a deadly virus through blood called Rage. 28 days later a man awakens in the hospital and learns that everyone is infested and pursues him with animalistic hunger. He is aided by a black female who swings a nasty machete, and another male. They are soon joined by a father and son duo. Detailed screenplay until the third act where it turns to guck with human forces battling each other as well as the zombies. It also doesn't help when the ending gives off a sort of happy-go-lucky feel. Story gives no answer to the virus, but it is director Danny Boyle's best film since Trainspotting. Cillian Murphy pulls through as a survivor who awakens to the nightmare. Naomie Harris plays his female companion who ends up the victim of male sexual violence. Christopher Ecceston plays a corrupt military person with sadistic plans. Megan Burns plays another survivor. It regards mankind and destruction with little hope for reparation.

32,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Completely overrated and quite boring,5,31 March 2016,"Waking up in an abandoned London, a man learns that a recently- escaped virus has spread throughout the population and left him with several lone survivors of the plague and try to make their way to safety among the swarm of creatures trying to kill them.There isn't a whole lot here that actually works.one of the film's few bright spots here is the action-packed encounters with the creatures, which is usually a lot of fun with some nice brutal action throughout here. Among the better attacks is the opening in the lab where the infected chimps get loose and attack the freedom-fighters freeing them as the hysteria and chaos works nicely whilst the chimps go crazy in the middle of the room, while the other big scenes include the first encounter in the deserted city streets where his confusion after just waking up and seeing them comes off as a great chase scene before he gets saved and the brawling done in the different locations in their journey. Likewise, the scenes at the end in the compound is all sorts of fun where the infected soldiers are loosened on the others resulting in some utterly fun and exciting moments here with the ravenous beings running loose in the complex while the raging thunderstorm carries on outside leaving this with a strong, violent and action-packed series of scenes. Along with the fine gore and make-up effects, it's about all this one has as there's quite a bit of stuff featured here that's not all that enjoyable. One of the biggest issues here is that even though we get off to a rousing start, we don't get anything afterwards for quite a while which leaves a long gap between action. This cuts into the films pace, as we get a great last half with an okay beginning, but that middle part is what really drags. There is way too much exploration of the city and talking amongst the people to really get into the film. We don't need four discussions about the same event at different times, which gets rather boring at times to sit through some of that as there is way too much redundant talking in the movie that throws the pace off. Even worse, there is that dreaded quick- cut style of editing in the film that renders so much of the film barely able to figure out. This style of filming scenes is completely aggravating and doesn't make the scene look good. All we get is a sense of what is going on, as we're just guessing because the editing and camera movements are so erratic and in the end all it does is make the audience confused as to make is actually happening. The other flaw here is the film's tendency to really come up short on logical explanations for everything, leaving the origins or purpose of the contagion a mystery and having the release of it occurring as rather forgone afterthoughts. The soldier's purpose as well makes no sense, and on the whole this leaves far more questions than answers and really lowering this one as a whole.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language, full male Nudity, depiction of events in animal testing centers, and children- in-jeopardy.",28 Days Later...
33,FlashCallahan,Creme de Menthe all round please....,9,11 April 2013,"Animal activists invade a laboratory with the intention of releasing chimpanzees that are undergoing experimentation, infected by a virus -a virus that causes rage. The activists ignore the pleas of a scientist to keep the cages locked, with disastrous results. Jim wakes up from a coma, alone, in an abandoned hospital, 28 days later. He finds London deserted, apparently without a living soul. After finding a church, which had become inhabited by humans intent on his demise, he runs for his life. Selena and Mark rescue him from the horde and bring him up to date on the mass carnage and horror as all of London tore itself apart.....What makes this movie stand out from other movies of the same sub-genre, is that it grabs you right from the opening, and never lets go until Jim becomes the thing he is running from.The opening is something beautiful, surreal, and so visceral, it strikes the fear of god into, thinking that it could possibly be a reality. Vanilla Sky only wishes it had done that scene so classy.When we finally meet friendlies, the film turns into a survival picture, the four characters trying to find salvation, thanks to Ecclestons radio broadcast. Of course along the way, the group have many setbacks, but this is all filmed so beautifully by Boyle, you can forgive the odd troupe.Murphy is amazing in this, he really deserves the career he has now, all thanks to his portrayal of Jim. Kudos too to Gleeson and Eccleston, who put in the most humanistic performances as the doting father, and the man who wants to start from scratch respectively.Harris is okay, but her character grates a little bit, the tough as nails woman, who won't take any rubbish from anyone and is a tough egg to crack. Have a guess who ends up in love come the end, knitting jumpers.Editing is splendid, and narrative really keeps the film going along at a fast pace, and the final act, where Murphy turns into destructor, it comes full circle, with Boyle showing the audience that the rage virus is all in us, we just know how to control it.So all in all, it's one of the finest British Horror movies made this decade, and one of Boyles best.And I never even mentioned Zombie in this review........oh.",28 Days Later...

Everyone said this was a good movie...a ""Dawn of the Dead"" type movie. This movie doesn't even come close. First of all, it is not a zombie movie at all. The people seem to have rabies and are called the infected. Sure they may attack humans, but that does not make them the undead. The undead are usually a lot tougher to kill. This one starts out promising enough with a guy waking up in a hospital naked (could have done without the full nudity) and everything in the city is deserted. The movie makers did a great job of making the city look empty. The guy goes into a church and encounters one of the rabid infected people and makes a run for it. He runs into two survivors and there are some good scenes here including the only gory death in the movie when a gal has to kill her friend. Then the movie becomes very dull and the infected are seen almost not at all. I think the ""Hulk"" had more screen time than the so-called zombies in this movie. The two remaining members end up finding more survivors. A father and his daughter and this dude with a bat who for some reason is only shown once and never seen again. The group has this peppy conversation on how they need each other and decide to go on a road trip to a place they heard about on the radio. I was waiting for them to start singing ""There's got to be a morning after"". They embark on their road trip and it is a three-day trip. During the trip they have a rather good stop in the tunnel, one of the last good scenes in the movie where they encounter the infected. The rest of their road trip is nice and bland...they stay out in the open and no ""zombies"" bother them. The ""zombies"" apparently are drawn only to candles and not to bonfires. The heroes get to the army base and of course the army has ulterior motives that have nothing to do with the ""zombies"" and the rest of the movie just sucks. I am still waiting for the violent, gory finale I was promised by a reviewer. I really have to wonder if those who compared this to ""Dawn of the Dead' have actually seen Dawn? Sure Romero used a story too, but he had lots more action and gore and horror. He never forgot that the main reason we went to his movies was to see zombies.",28 Days Later...
35,mm-39,"I liked it, and my wife hated it!",7,7 July 2003,"Spoilers. I must give the British credit, for they know how to stretch a budget to its limits. My wife noticed the mansion they used was from the movie 'a bridge too far'.  Anyway she hated this film, found it boring and would give it a 3.  Myself, I found this movie entertaining.  Forget about the science fiction premise, this movie is about the human condition and the effects of stress on it.  My father says do gooders usually have the best intentions, but think with emotion instead of logic.  This is the premise of what causes the end of civilized England, the story at the end gives clues that the island nation contained the virus, and stopped it.  I love the thinking in this film especially the cute comment about eradiated food.  Working at the post office I see daily how stress, desperation, and stupidity play on the human condition.  The part where the survivors find the soldiers (not special forces but normal people) and what stress would do is accurate.  Bad situations test peoples' character and brings the worst out.  I believe the major had good intentions to begin with, trying to bring women in for his men, but creates a solution more terrible than the problem.  Not enough women and TOO MANY MEN.  I believe if the hero was not there to fight with them, then the soldiers would of started fighting with each other.  Bars try to keep the ratio even, the Antarctic station banned women for fear of love triangles, and when it was lifted they had a murder love triangle afterwards.  This film exploits this premise believably.  People fighting over the leftovers.  In the end, the film shows the virus only takes out our darker emotions of the infected when situations bring us into a rage.  I give it 7 out of 10.",28 Days Later...

This poor guy winds up meeting another human being, a female who gives him guidance and romance. However, I forgot to mention that there also was a scene in the beginning which dealt with monkeys in a laboratory who seemed to have very bad tempers.

38,Smells_Like_Cheese,"The short British version of ""The Stand""",8,28 November 2003,"28 Days Later, I had heard about this movie a little bit when it was first released here in the US. I wasn't sure what to expect, but people were saying that it was extremely scary and one of the best horror films they had seen in a while. So my mother bought it on DVD and we watched it together, I would say it's not just one of the best horror films in years, but it was also one of the more brilliant one's. We all know the ultimate fear of maybe waking up to a different world and the main character just doesn't wake up to a different world, but a very nightmarish one where people have gone from eating food to eating human flesh! This is not very pretty.Late one night, British animal rights activists break into a research facility to free chimpanzees being used for medical research. The local scientist warns the activists that the chimps are infected with something he only calls ""Rage,"" but the activists disregard him and set a chimp free. It immediately attacks and infects the activists and scientist. 28 days later, a bicycle courier named Jim awakens from a coma in a deserted hospital. As he leaves the hospital, he discovers London is completely deserted and rife with signs of catastrophe. Jim is soon discovered and chased through the streets by infected people before being rescued by two survivors, Selena and Mark, who rush him to their hideout in the London Underground. They reveal that while Jim was comatose, the virus spread uncontrollably among the populace, turning most people into vicious monsters and resulting in societal collapse, possibly on a global scale. That night, two of the Infected attack the survivors, and when the fight ends they discover that Mark is bleeding and is likely infected. Selena kills him, explaining to Jim that infection is spread through the blood and overwhelms its victims in seconds, rendering them deadly to others. They discover two more survivors, Frank and his teenage daughter Hannah, holed up in an abandoned block of flats. The next morning, Frank informs Jim and Selena that supplies, particularly water, are dwindling, and shows them a prerecorded radio broadcast loop transmitted by soldiers near Manchester who claim to have ""the answer to infection."" But this is the government, we know how this always goes.This is a great horror film that I'm sure will not disappoint you, this has one of the most intense scenes of all time in it. When the gang is in the tunnel trying to get to the sunlight as quick as they can before the ""virus"" attacks them as well, but they accidentally make a noise and it awakens the dead people and it becomes the ultimate chase for life. Plus these are not George A. Romaro's walking zombies that you can for the most part outrun, this is zombies on speed and they are terrifying. So I do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, it's a great horror movie, has good actors, and a terrifying story that will probably give you some really scary nightmares. Not to scare you off, but that's an effective horror film and believe me I have seen them all, so 28 Days Later is a new treasure of mine.8/10",28 Days Later...
39,=G=,"Not a sequel to Bullock's ""28 Days"".",6,22 October 2003,"""28 Day Later"" tells of a trio of people who survive a raging plague which turns infected people into blood-thirsty maniacs who in turn infect others, etc. The problem confronting our group in this post apocalyptic type sci-fi/horror hybrid is: How do we stay alive, discover other survivors, and perpetuate the human race. On the upside, the flick is well done in a smart and gritty style, only has one dream sequence, and doesn't throw cheap shots at you. On the downside, it asks more questions than it answers, neglects the human story in deference to logistics and action, and is lacking big budget Hollywoodish extras. An okay watch for those into this kind of flick. (B-)",28 Days Later...

41,KineticSeoul,Probably the first zombie movie I seen and I liked it,7,24 February 2012,"Yeah zombie movies has been done many times. But what makes this movie stand out is the atmosphere, the way it's directed and the feeling of being alone during the chaos. As the movie progresses you don't know what is going to happen next. This isn't just a zombie movie well it is, but it also has a bit of humanity in it as well. The origin of the zombie virus is irritating to watch but is also a plus in a way as well. This is also probably the first movie I seen with Cillian Murphy and the guy is a very good actor. And the way he portrays a character that is alone and doesn't know what is going on is very believable. So the premise is after the spread of a virus that turns people into zombies, Jim played by Cillian Murphy is alone and doesn't know what is going on in a abandoned London. But is in for a whole lot of zombie chaos and something more. Also what makes this movie more frightening is how turning into a zombie isn't a slow process in this, you turn from 10 to 20 seconds. The directing is done in a way that is grimy and gritty, which works for a movie like this.7.8/10",28 Days Later...

I wouldn't object to the fact that the movie doesn't have a thought in its head if it was scarier, and I would mind the rather mild thrills if the movie were original and clever, but this movie is so utterly insubstantial in all ways (except for the rather stylish look) that it felt like a complete waste of my time. I thought the cast was good and some of the early scenes were actually quite effective, but by the half way point the movie had completely wore out its welcome as it became increasingly unlikely and unpleasant.

43,Robert_duder,Cult classic certainly spins a different sort of genre,7,15 December 2007,"28 Days Later is not a zombie film. It's usually mistakenly referred to as that and usually compared with Night of The Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead and the likes and the comparisons are not unfounded but still very misguided. I think director and creator Danny Boyle created something very unique and introspective when it comes to the horror zombie genre. Somewhere amidst the gore and gratuitous bad language is some sort of moral about people and survival and people killing people but it's kind of lost in the fact that ultimately this is a horror, blood splashing gore fest with zombie like creatures that are still not intelligent but fast moving and really angry. The landscape of England is a brutally isolated and disturbing setting for the film and the gray and dreariness of it really puts you in the mood for the story. Enter not only terrifying rage filled human creatures but deranged and sadistic soldiers and a small group of survivors who bond over their situation. The great thing about this film compared to something like Night of The Living Dead and the sequels and remakes and such is that 28 Days Later has far more of an interesting story complete with an actual beginning, climax and end and surprisingly the ending is almost a happy one or has the potential for a happy ending.Cillian Murphy, looking disturbingly sickly and pale, plays Jim, the hero to the story. Murphy is terrific in this role because he's dark and mysterious but quickly adapts to having to survive. I almost didn't recognize Murphy because his performance was so different from his more mainstream films as of late. He didn't look as evil and bad guy as he usually does but instead plays Jim with a certain subtly and importance and his character really changes throughout. Naomie Harris plays Selena, another survivor who ends up teamed up with Jim after saving his life. Harris is the perfect balance to Murphy's Jim. Whereas Jim is quiet, subtle, and dark, Selena is loud and bold, and touch and strong but still needs rescuing and needs to find faith again that all is not lost. Harris and Murphy have good chemistry and do a terrific job. Megan Burns is decent as the youngest group of their survival squad, Hannah. She has a lot of importance to the story and seems to become a hope for survival to Jim as he protects her. Unfortunately her role lacks something and she comes across as a little boring at times. Brendan Gleeson also plays a small yet very important role as Hannah's father Frank. He's a strong, down to earth character that will stop at nothing to protect his daughter.28 Days Later wasn't perfect. I didn't find it overtly scary as much as it was disturbing in a political and real way. The humans gone mad were far scarier than the ones infected. There were no jumps or chills just a lot of gore and blood and a half decent story as well. It felt like the type of movie that would jump start a series (which they are now into the second film which I can't wait to see.) Still as I stated earlier 28 Days Later is something completely different from an overplayed and dull genre and bravo to them for doing that. A strong cast and a decent story makes for a cult classic to say the least and I do see why people love it. I just thought it was a little dull at times and didn't really move at the pace that I had hoped. After watching the DVD's and the alternate endings I am really glad they ended it the way they did. It would have been very stereotypical for them to kill off everyone or almost everyone in the main cast but instead they actually spun it with a potentially happy ending. Part of the moral of the film is that Jim is determined to prove to Selena that all is not lost and that rings true in the end making everything fit together. Overall a good strong movie that many love. Definitely worth seeing if you're tired of the same old Zombie crap out there. 7/10",28 Days Later...
44,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A refreshing genre experience that often reminds you how much digital cinematography has improved.,6,11 November 2018,"Though '28 Days Later... (2002)' uses digital cameras in an undeniably groundbreaking and trendsetting way, watching this 'zombie movie' (even in HD on its Blu-Ray transfer) really just reminds you how far we've come in today's world of super-crisp, high-definition, 'film-competing' digital cinematography. It's often, to an extent, an exercise in resilience, as you sometimes have to squint and strain your way through its most 'SD' of sequences. It's the energetic way that Boyle uses the camera that makes the piece work, though. The influence of the feature is undeniable and even reaches to its fast-moving fiends, for this is the feature that first introduced the world to the 'runner zombie' and, naturally, it's also the one in which the concept is arguably done the best. Its creatures are surprisingly, creepily versatile and viciously relentless, to boot; it isn't hard to see why they were essentially copied across many a film to come, with varying degrees of success. The narrative itself is full of subtext and often pulls back to focus on the too often overlooked, eerily quiet aspects of a near-extinct population. All of this makes for a refreshing genre experience with a phenomenal score that's only really hampered by some dated visuals and a story that only goes so far in being entertaining. 6/10",28 Days Later...
45,bowmanblue,Two horror films for the price of one,10,23 November 2014,"It's pretty much taken for granted that '28 Days Later' is a seminal British horror film. And it is. It helped revitalise the 'zombie genre' by making the undead into more than just - George Romero-style - 'shufflers.' It also started a trend in 'disaster movies' showing well-known locations (in this case London) eerily deserted.Everyman, Jim, wakes up from a coma to find a disease has spread through Britain turning everyone into zombies (or the 'infected' if we're being technical, as they're still alive). Now he must look for survivors and stay one step ahead of the psychotic enemy.You'll find not many people will say anything too negative about 28 Days Later. It's actually pretty good from beginning to end. However, there is a distinct change of tone midway through the film that does seem to grate on even the most die-hard of fans. It's like two horror films stuck together. The second could be completely independent to the first.However, both halves have their merits. The first half is creepy and sets the tone for a different type of ending that what's to come. The second half is more action-orientated and the infected (of which have been the bad guys during the first half) seem to take a back seat to human adversaries.But no matter how much the change annoys you, the acting is still fine, the sets terrifically creepy, the characters charming enough for us to care about their fates and the direction - naturally - slick, courtesy of Danny Boyle.All in all, this is a British classic horror that has spawned numerous inferior imitations. If you like your horror gritty, then this one is for you.",28 Days Later...
46,ThomasDrufke,Beautiful Wasteland,7,18 May 2015,"Never being a horror fan, I'm always hesitant on watching that genre of filmmaking. It's not because I don't think they make for good cinema, they certainly do. But in most horror films that I have seen, they don't give me much more than a few scares and jumps. But 28 Days Later is a much different story. It's ability to balance the frightening movements of zombies with the beautiful imagery of a world without people. It's the scenes with simple and quiet shots of wastelands that haunt me more than the zombies themselves.We begin with seeing experiments on apes, because of course humans cant be at fault for the virus. But in reality they are. It was an accidental spread from humans. As creepy as the opening scene was, I didn't find it to be paid off in any way throughout the film. I just felt like that could have been explained in a voice-over or monologue. No matter, we then find our lead character, Jim, played by the brilliant Cillian Murphy. He of course is clueless about the outbreak as he has been in a coma for 28 days. The initial shots of him walking through Cambridge with no one to be seen were both gorgeous and haunting. Much like in I Am Legend, we all wonder, what the hell would we do if we had the whole city to ourselves? Jim comes across Serena and another man who end up saving his life. But we soon learn the details of the virus and how quickly it infects people. After the other guy dies, Jim and Serena are forced to keep moving. The two initially despise one another and don't want anything to do with each other, but as they meet Frank and Hannah, their minds change. In situations like this, it seems as though everyone has a breaking point. As strong as you think you are by yourself, you always need help, and the 4 of them learned that along the way.The joy of the shopping scene was one of the highlights of the movie for me, as it was the only scene where all of our leads were genuinely happy. It's a simple smile that you remember from scenes like this. As chaos unfolds and each character comes into their own, choices had to be made. I think Jim's character arc was great as the more he grew adapt to the situation, the more he acted like the infected. Which by the way, Danny Boyle did a great job at imagining new types of zombies. They move fast and frantically instead of the stupidity of slowly walking. His filming of them was also fascinating. There weren't many moments if at all that he surprised us with their appearance. Often, he would show them first to us, before the characters would see them. In terms of the ending, well I could tell that the directors had different intentions, and hearing about the alternate endings, I think I would have preferred one of those to the one we got. It's a different approach to the horror and jump scare moments. So in all, 28 Days Later is a refreshing take on the horror and zombie genre. It's still not my cup of tea, but I can respect it's greatness.+Cillian's arc +New types of zombies +Boyle's style +Beautiful quiet moments -Opening didn't pay off -Ending felt contrived 7.6/10",28 Days Later...

48,Cineanalyst,Infectious Grit,8,25 March 2020,"Credited with reviving the zombie genre, although it reuses the viral outbreak idea from the ""Resident Evil"" franchise, and some question whether it's a zombie movie at all--I guess because the infected are alive and fast or something, ""28 Days Later"" is more remarkable for its gritty style, as aided by the then-new technology of digital cameras, infecting the genre with a low-resolution, guerrilla filmmaking look akin to the exploitation cinema from which zombies were first reanimated on screen in George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968).Consequently, the opening lab scene looks especially grotesque, including a rage-filled primate forced to watch similarly low-res, violent screen images, à la ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971). This analogy of seeing with gritty, enraged infection is later recalled when an eye is contaminated. The protagonist waking up from a coma to discover a post-apocalyptic landscape would later be ripped-off by ""The Walking Dead"" franchise, although the shots of him wandering through a deserted London remain unmatched. It's also a stark contrast to the frenetic finale--alternate epilogues aside.",28 Days Later...

50,CuriosityKilledShawn,Failed Potential,4,15 May 2004,"With the exception of the opening 10 minutes, 28 Days Later fails completely. The scenes of the Jim (Cillian Murphy) walking around an abandoned, completely deserted London are creepy and un-nerving. The scenes that hint at mystery and unknown danger are far more intriguing than the rest of the movie. As soon as Jim hooks up with other survivors the scares are lost. Danny Boyle stupidly telegraphs every jump to the point of disqualification. When the survivors leave London and are 'rescued' by a bunch of thuggish army louts it degenerates into extremely cruddy sub-straight-to-video nonsense. I've never seen a film lose its way so badly as this. What could have been really exciting and scary ends up being too cheap and confused.There are hardly any 'zombies' in this movie. Any action or thrills are over within seconds and the complete lack of logical thinking (even within the morally bankrupt army) becomes annoying. It did appreciate the raw-looking photography, it gave the movie a realistic edge but it's soon ruined as the plot meanders and doesn't know what to do. Cillian Murphy was quite good as the hero but the woman playing Selena was too brutish and hostile to be sympathetic. I did like Brendan Gleeson's character but he wasn't in it long enough.Mainly, 28 Days Later suffers badly from minimal plotting, awkward characters, a distinct lack of scares and a corny ending that's out of sync with everything that preceded it. Danny Boyle should NOT attempt horror again.The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Extras include a commentary, documentary and deleted scenes.

54,The-Sarkologist,"Not truly a horror film, but pretty decent in any case",7,3 February 2012,"When I first heard about this film I completely wrote it off believing that it was a sequel to a Sandra Bullock movies that I simply was not interested in (that being 28 days). However, others told me that this simply was not the case, and was in fact a science-fiction horror film, so when I finally got to watch it for the first time round I repented of the fact that I had so pre-judged this film.Basically this is a zombie film, though the term zombie, or living dead, is never used (in the same way that the term vampire is never used in I Am Legend, which indicates very good writing), rather they are termed as The Infected. The movie opens in a lab were some animal rights activists release a chimp, but the chimp is infected with the Rage virus, and when one of the activists is bitten, it sets off a chain reaction. More on the background to the Rage virus and the actions of the activists can be found in the graphic novel 28 Days The Aftermath.28 days later Jim (Cilliam Murphy) wakes up in a hospital and discovers that London is completely deserted. Has he wonders around he encounters a couple of the infected (in the form of a priest) and kills him. Then he stumbles across a couple of survivors, and after hearing a radio message, travel to Manchester to attempt to find safety. Basically civilisation as far as we know it has completely collapsed and everybody is dead.The main part of the film deals with the interactions with the remains of the army battalion whole up in a manor house outside of Manchester. In a way, the infected simply play a bit role in the film. We know that they are there, and we even encounter them, but they are not the major antagonist in the film, the remnants of the army are. As Major West (Christopher Eccleston) says, by themselves the men have no hope, but with women around, there is hope because they can repopulate the land. This is when things get desperate, as Jim must then outwit trained military personal (no mean feat in itself) and then rescue his two female travelling companions.The film apparently has up to 8 endings, most of them resulting in Jim dying. It was suggested that Fox did not like an ending where Jim simply did not die, or it was too inconclusive, so the current ending, where all three of them are waving down the Finnish airforce jet was the one chosen. In the end, it was believed that this film was so bleak, that it had to have some sort of satisfying ending.",28 Days Later...

It is far tamer in terms of violence and horror jump scares than expected. This is a very mild horror film and most of it isn't scary. It is more of a virus based drama than a zombie movie. Though the buildup and explanation of the virus was well done. It does keep it intriguing.The ending is somewhat different as we see the lead protagonist Jim (Cillian Murphy) turn into an action hero- where he didn't show any tendencies of such prior. Also there is a supermarket scene which feels out of place, but perhaps was added to lighten the mood.The film is mostly predictable as we know the main characters are going to survive but along the way we do see things come in their way.",28 Days Later...

60,johnnyboyz,Shocks; scares; an excellent attitude to horror as a genre and some excellent character observations render 28 Days Later one of the greats.,9,3 December 2009,"The streets are empty; the nation is crumbling, with cities either deserted or on fire; whatever event that has rendered the enemies of the film of the uncanny variety has been unleashed; only a small band of human survivors remain and nobody seems to have much of a plan. So arrived in cinemas back in 2002 a relatively familiar premise for a horror film, to be shot on digital video and staring a ragtag bunch of unfamiliar acting talent attempting to get across the raw fear and sensations of finding oneself in this predicament. The film was helmed by Englishman Danny Boyle; who was getting back to scuzzy, low level based pictures much in the vein of his earlier feature Trainspotting, this following the bleached out and visually alluring 2000 effort The Beach. It's to everyone's great credit that 28 Days Later holds up as one of my favourite horror films, and one of my favourite overall films of the decade.With a 2007 sequel following it; a cast of actors who have since gone on to bigger and richer things as well as a director who has consequently churned out equally nourishing film-going experiences in Sunshine and Slumdog Millionaire, revisiting 28 Days Later after however long it's been is strangely humbling. Set on the ""diseased, decaying island"", as one character calls it, that is Britain; 28 Days Later gets across scares; knows when to provide the sequences of gore; is able to provide an adequate number of suspenseful set-pieces; knows how to pace and where to place its scenes of terror and realisation of the overall situation while its instances of comedy and attention to character are equally seamlessly woven in.The film carries a very broad, quite epic feel to it. While similar in genre and premise, the film is the polar opposite to something like 2002's Resident Evil, or that respective film's first sequel. For all the money and gimmicks thrown at the screen in those films, what with their vast and expansive underground laboratory locales; lots of attention to fight scene aesthetics; inclusion of all things scientific and 'smart' sounding; nonsense narratives that flesh out into company cover-ups and so on, 28 Days Later works ten times as better with its stripped down and simplistic sense. It's to Boyle's great credit he achieves this with limited money and a shooting format more akin to student pieces than feature films due for cinematic release are. All the film does in vacate a location; spread a few discarded props here and there and bingo: you've got something is so simple yet so effective.The film begins with found footage of riots; if we go into the film with knowledge of the premise, we might feel a little underwhelmed at the use of such footage to 'act' as a representation that the 'zombies' are taking over and that the world is falling apart. But no, these are VT's being pumped into the minds of chimps as a new 'rage' virus is tested in a science lab somewhere in England. Animal activists, however, have different ideas and when an infected chimp gets out – all Hell breaks loose. When we first see Irish protagonist Jim (Murphy), he is lying stark naked on a hospital bed, all by himself, with wires and tubes coming out of him from every which way. Jim's progression from vulnerable and somewhat pathetic looking individual; to hospital cloak-clad scavenger; to naive 'infected' thwarter; to someone who gets a grip on the situation, is developed flawlessly by Boyle in the opening half an hour or so. Jim's initial contact with an 'infected' sees him take an instinctive swipe at it – it's an instinctive trait that'll see him survive to the best of his ability. The study of Jim and his progression into a bigger and more brutal character is one of the film's many sequences of well observed substantial passages linked to character.28 Days Later knows how to stop and it knows how to slow down in order give its characters room to breath and time to absorb their situation. Rather than opt for Resident Evil's kinetic energy, during which no one in the audience ever really feels as if any of the characters are in any danger of any kind, the film is driven by characters and their decisions. One is a male Irish lead and the other is his black, of Carribbean descent, female equal. She is Selena (Harris), a tough; hard-bodied; machete wielding foil to Jim whom saves his life twice and is begged a third time on a flight of stairs to do so again. We don't figure Selena to have been like this prior to the apocalypse, so a great deal has already happened to get her to this point. She is only ever really 'put in her place' when encountering figures whom represent the anti-thesis of feminism; that is to say, archetypes who want her to serve as someone that is useful for merely cooking and reproducing, as the re-population of Britain begins again from a disturbingly primitive starting point.Regarding these types, those that drive the final third, their presence meekly calls to mind that somewhat interesting theory which I'm told inhabited James Cameron's 1986 film Aliens; that of the monsters being of one 'sort' of evil whereas certain human-beings representing another. In 28 Days Later, those that display levels of intellect or oppositional ideologies are shunned as the aforementioned ideas of a woman's ""rightful"" role in the world are played out as well – it all builds to a frightening climax. What with all this fascinating attention to character, role and predicament; Boyle remembers its genre cinema he's dealing with here and offers a number of scares and shocks anyway, giving the film a rounded sense. The film presents us with a familiar premise, but it's executed with such punch and such freshness that results in it just coming across as superb.",28 Days Later...
61,filipemanuelneto,More interesting than I thought.,7,16 April 2020,"When I decided to watch this film, I thought it would be just another zombie B movie. However, I think I was wrong. The plot is much better and more interesting.It all starts when a group of animal activists break into a laboratory to free chimpanzees that are used as guinea pigs. It turns out that at least some were infected with a new virus, which spreads through body fluids and was being studied. Sometime after that, Jim wakes up from a 28-day coma caused by a car accident. To his surprise, he did not see a single person and only when reading some abandoned newspapers did he realize that, while he was hospitalized, the entire population was either evacuated or died. There follows a search for someone still alive, and the struggle to survive.This film is set against the backdrop of a Zombie pandemic, but the focus is not on those infected or the panic surrounding the disease and its fight. When the movie starts it has already happened, the city is deserted and it looks like the entire human race has been killed. It is quite intense to see this on the screen and a very positive point. I made an effort not to get caught up in details, if we start to think hard the plot reveals flaws in logic. Things get worse in the final half, with the soldiers behaving like mercenaries, in addition to maintaining an ""fort"" in an unusual way, without any kind of replenishment of ammunition or food ... it's like I say: if we think of ourselves plot details, it falls apart.The best part of the film is to focus on the characters and allow us to create an emotional bond with them as we get to know them better. This is not very common in these films. Cillian Murphy did a good job, very psychological. We can see the internal conflicts that his character lives, particularly when he is faced with death (that of people who are dear to him, that of people who have to kill to stay alive). He was the most anonymous of the actors in the film, but the effort paid off: it opened doors for more ambitious works like ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and ""Cold Mountain"". Naomi Harris is excellent too, has the presence and inner strength that her character needed. Like Noah Huntley, whom she shades almost completely, she already had a steady TV career. Brendan Gleeson is also a veteran and plays an excellent role here. The worst was the soldiers. It is from there that the film begins to gradually lose itself until reaching a rather weak ending, in the style of Rambo, or something like that. Even so, it is a film that is superior to a lot of American trash that circulates around.Technically, it is a very interesting film. The direction, ensured by Danny Boyle, bets strongly on discrete special effects that accentuate the dramatic tension and suspense without overlapping the work of the actors or the story. I think Boyle realized that this is, in fact, the role of special and sound effects, very much in contrast to what we see in American films, where the use and abuse of effects and CGI sometimes make you forget what goes on in the film.Overall, it is a good film, albeit with flaws.",28 Days Later...
62,Tweetienator,Still Supreme,9,11 October 2018,"28 Days Later... was and still is really one of the finest moments regarding the zombie genre and every director who wants to make a zombie movie should not only watch this one ten times and more but analyse it thoroughly - no matter if one planes to let his zombies walk or run.This one, like a very few other movies of the genre, that take zombies and walkers serious, show that good acting, a good script and a good production are no impossibility if you make a movie about the undead. With Alex Garland (script) and Danny Boyle (directing) of course two very talented guys are responsible for the quality of this little gem.Still top notch - especially if you compare this one to the tons and tons of crappy and mediocre movies that are published under the flag of the undead.",28 Days Later...

When the movie was over, we turned to each other and said, ""well that was a total anti-war movie.""This movie, isn't a horror movie. It's a political statement.I didn't care for any of it because the writer and director, Garland and Boyle, set out to blend both the horrors of war with the horror genre. It would have worked if they didn't make it so anti-government, anti-war, anti-politics.The casting is good, the special effects are good, the cinematography is good, but the writing and directing is what ruined it for me.

65,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A zombie film with brains, not just eaten ones",8,13 June 2009,"Just because it happens to be a very good movie, calling ""28 Days Later"" more than a zombie flick is inaccurate: Gore and other general zombie fare that's turned these movies into a genre are still the film's main vehicle for delivering entertainment. What it does differently, however, is make you think a bit more, make you feel a bit more. The zombies might be mindless, but director Danny Boyle's film is far from it.The premise is one we've heard before: an uncontrollable outbreak of a disease turns people into raging zombies who lust for blood and violence. The location is London and the protagonist who doesn't get infected is Jim (Cillian Murphy), who wakes up from an accident 28 days after the breakout to find London abandoned. In his quest for survival, he meets other uninfected people and together they try to find others to begin life anew.The first thing worth mentioning is that if ""28 Days Later"" were just another zombie movie, it'd still be one of the best because of Boyle. The ""Trainspotting"" director's style is unique, striking and suspenseful. He gets multiple angles for many of the major scenes and edits them to fire off rapidly or slowly to give a sense that the characters are being watched. He places the camera in all kinds of intriguing places to get provocative shots and it gives the story its own special life.Alex Garland's screenplay is also special. In his second time working with Boyle, Garland creates a concept that doesn't merely serve for great suspense, but acts as a social metaphor for war and violence as indicated by the opening seconds of the film. The mere concept of ""rage"" spreading quickly like a disease is quite smart. It's not allegorical or driven all the way through the film, but it's there and it makes the film more respectable and interesting. Jim is also a great protagonist, being both innocent toward the beginning but willing to take risks and he evolves into quite the hero in the film's final act. Murphy is a definite talent: a subtle one, but very good.Then again, ""28 Days Later"" is also just a good suspenseful zombie movie with a very fine director who understands how to apply his style to a different genre effectively. Everything else is sort of like free dessert.",28 Days Later...

67,Anonymous_Maxine,Not bad...,7,15 April 2008,"It should be noted that 28 Days Later is not a horror film, it's a pretty clear cut science fiction film, with some horror elements. The movie starts with a half-witted premise, a bunch of animal rights activists break into a lab and release some monkeys, on which apparently horrible tests are being conducted. What they don't realize, and don't allow one desperate scientist to explain, is that the monkeys are infected with ""Rage,"" which turns out to be an astonishing disease. The minute the first monkey is free, it screams and spits and bites the first person it comes into contact with, causing her to seemingly start to spit out her insides.Sounds pleasing, right? The infections scenes are done really well, it's the implication that this is going to turn into a zombie movie that may cause the eyes to glaze over. But the 28 days in the title refers to when the movie takes place. It seems that a London bicycle courier named Jim (played effectively by Cillian Murphy) has suffered a near fatal traffic accident and woke up in the hospital, 28 days after the accidental release of the rage virus. The London that he finds as he wanders out of the empty hospital is, of course, very different from the one that he left.This is one of those movies that was wisely shot on a different medium than is generally used for modern films. Director Danny Boyle opted to shoot the movie on digital video rather than film, which not only made the film much more affordable (a huge budget, after all, could very well have ruined it), but also gave the movie that gritty, realistic feel that movies like this should have. There are standard rules applied to the infection, such as that if someone becomes infected you have about 20 seconds to kill them before they kill you. Basically, the virus created was meant to be sort of a counteractive drug to combat rage. The ultimate anger management, if you will. But unfortunately, in order to fight rage, the scientists had to create pure rage in their test subjects, the monkeys, and then try to fight it. Unfortunately, rather than reducing pure, unfiltered anger, they turned it into an infectious disease. Oops. Before long, Jim is traveling with Selina, a hardened survivor who has learned to detach all emotional connections with other people in case she suddenly finds herself faced with the decision to die or kill someone close to her in less than 20 seconds. They meet up with a big tender man named Frank and his daughter, holed up in a high-rise apartment building, and ultimately the four of them decide to try to drive in Frank's London taxi cab toward what a mysterious broadcast on the radio claims is a safe zone.Obviously, there's no way of knowing whether the message is reliable or not (and yes, the mysterious broadcast is one of the most routine, redundant plot devices in the movie, which is a big statement, given that post-apocalyptic zombie movies tend to generally be driven by routine, redundant plot devices), but they take the risk. Life in a high rise apartment building may get real old real quick.What follows is probably the dumbest scene in the entire movie, where the car careens effortlessly over a jam of gridlocked cars in a tunnel. The scene is so improbable and so incongruous to the relative realism (so to speak) of the rest of the movie that I can only guess that it's some kind of in joke which only Londoners, and maybe even only London taxi drivers, would know or understand. Then come the plot holes. When Jim first walked out of that hospital, he found London totally deserted. There was NO ONE in the city. You may find yourself overwhelmed by the astonishing sight of London really deserted (they really cleared the streets for those shots), which may lead you to forget that, since no one is around, presumably everyone who was infected is not only dead, but their scattered carcasses have been cleaned up by someone. Once infected, how long can the host expect to live? 20 minutes? A day? A month? Or maybe they just went into hiding like in I Am Legend. Attributing an intolerance of daylight would not be the only zombie or vampire-like quality attributed to those infected with rage in this movie. In the political and military climate into which the movie was released, it makes a strong comment on the possibility and danger of biological warfare, so much so that it may even seem to be cashing in on this fear. But not only does it call our attention to this possibility, even more than it might already have been there, it also forces us to consider what the world would be like after such an attack. I doubt it would be much like it is in the movie, but I also have a feeling that most people imagine what such an attack would look like, rather than what it would look like 28 days later.",28 Days Later...
68,jzappa,Above-Average and Character-Driven,8,28 October 2008,"I'm going to start off with my pettiest criticism so that you'll forget how cheap I am by the time you're finished reading: This movie starts off by establishing that animal rights activists are at fault for spreading the ""rage"" virus because they set lab animals free from their cages, only to find out too late that they've been turned into foaming, savage predators. I'm not saying that Alex Garland, the screenwriter, vilified animal rights activists on purpose, but isn't that the overall effect of the scene? That they're ignorant, malevolent anarchists who don't know what they're doing and cause massive destruction? I find that highly contemptible. But the rest of the film is fine.I remember when this film was released it was a breakthrough for both Cillian Murphy and the use of grainy, gritty digital video cinematography in mainstream movies. By now, we've already been introduced to the latter. When the former awakens in an empty hospital and leaves, he finds a forsaken London. In a sequence of astounding shots, he wanders with not a single person within reach, seeing from old wind-beaten newspapers of a virus that twisted human beings against itself.So opens this character-driven take on the post-apocalyptic horror movie, which starts as an above-average horror film and continues as an stimulating, however action-packed, inquiry of human nature (and yes, only human. In spite of the fact that this spread from chimps, there don't seem to be any animals that attack or are attacked by the rage-infected).Though famously indecisive regarding how to end this movie, director Danny Boyle, who by this time had made the enduring contemporary landmark Trainspotting, gives his sci-fi drama an abrupt documentary impression, making the film scarier through being more realistic, while at the same time making the movie less expensive. It makes you wonder about the formula credibility of movies like this: A more expensive film would have had more traditional action heroes, and less screen time in what would be a less patient stride to expand the gradually familial relationship between the unusual characters, each of them being everyday people transformed by inescapable circumstance. Throw enough money into this movie's broad concept, and it would have the penetration of the Resident Evil films or the Dawn of the Dead remake. Garland's script develops characters who seem to have a reality at a distance from their part in the plot, whose behavior determines what they do, where they go, and why.Naomie Harris's seemingly inscrutable, at first less than approachable black female becomes the bossy member of the intimate cluster, wearing the toughest and least emotional shell, imposing a hardened survivalist boundary. Timid Cillian Murphy would probably have died if he hadn't met her. Sooner or later they find solace with two other survivors: Brendan Gleeson's genial and resourceful father and his teenage daughter Hannah, of whom he is strongly protective. They've overwhelmingly fortified in a high-rise apartment, and use their hand-cranked radio to receive a broadcast from an Army unit near Manchester. Should they count on the broadcast and journey to what is illustrated as a safe haven? After some debate, the group, who seems to bond more and more every minute, resolves that the smartest thing to do is to take the chance.In a lesser film, and almost certainly an American one, there would be a sex scene between Murphy and Harris, but Boyle and Garland's work finds the fitting pitch in an instant where she pecks him on the cheek, and he's the one that blushes.The rage-infecteds bring up questions like, How long can one live once infected? Since London seems empty at the beginning, I assume the infecteds we see were survivors until somewhat lately. Another thought: Seeing as they run in hordes, why don't they attack one another? Its driving strand of the zombie-like outbreak seems allegorical, the film punctuates its assertion of a human's most rudimentary self in the climactic scene, which fulfills every ounce of pent-up aggression in you, the viewer, and though the third act does not quite live up to the promise of the first two, this climactic bloodbath is the highest point of the film.",28 Days Later...
69,videorama-759-859391,"Dawn Of The Dead London style, marks a new dawn of zombie film",8,1 July 2016,"Danny Trainspotting Boyle proves he can make all kinds of stuff, a director of versatility. Here he's made a very impressive, unsettling and believable film, a more serious take on the zombie films, we've grown to know and love. Coma patient Murphy, wakes up on the blackest of days, to find good ole London, void of human life. Some wide spread virus epidemic (though we don't find out it's cause) now in it's fourth week (hence the title) has spread through London, where bitten humans take zombie like form, but are much faster and agile, where only a small number of the unbitten and uninfected remain. Murphy meets up with a woman survivor, a teen girl and her ""old softie"" father, and a family type friendship forms. It mirrors some similarities of the Dawn Of The Dead remake, only this is a much smarter and better film. After a tragedy of misfortune within the group, they are taken in by an army of organized soldiers, who are dealing with the crisis, their way, where the film then draws shades of the original Day Of The Dead, even one scene kind of in unforgettably bad taste, with the woman and teen girl, are all doled up, for the men's pleasure. One other scene stays with me, played against the haunting beautiful score where 4 horses freely gait about. On the whole, this is one movie, like I said, which really impresses more than anything, a more seriously approached and well utilized film, that just doesn't go straight for the jugular. It has some truly scary moments too. Murphy is great, where the others do well too, but it's his intensely engaging performance that'll grab the viewer's eye, two years before he played that particularly nasty passenger in Red Eye.

70,Vartiainen,New style of zombie horror,6,17 November 2012,"In many ways this film lead the way for the new age of zombie horror. It's a film that takes its setting seriously and treats it with dignity and forethought. No longer are we supposed to fear zombies that shuffle ridiculously slowly through open fields where we can see them coming miles away. These zombies are vicious, fast and absolutely brutal in their search for human flesh. This idea had been seen before, but this film helped to popularize it and nowadays it's pretty much the norm for zombie flicks, which is great in my opinion as it increases the horror and makes the film more exciting, because you know that in physical confrontation with these zombies you'd almost surely lose.I also liked how they treat the human aspects of a zombie apocalypse. This was one of the first films of its kind where the true horror didn't come from the undead or the infected, as they are called, but rather from the other survivors. The zombies are a plague, a force of nature, in that they're utterly predictable and unable to reason or to be reasoned with. They're scary and to be avoided, but they're not malignant in a true sense of the word. Rather they're just driven by their instincts. Humans, on the other hand, are capable of true malignancy. They're capable of making the right choice, but they often get distracted by their urges and will make wrong decisions, quite often believing that they're justified in their behaviour. And that's what makes this film truly terrifying: watching as the last vestiges of civilizations bend, crack and crumble under impossible odds.So the basic story is good, it's very good. I also liked the main actors, who all felt like wholesome characters with their own motivations and urges. They also managed to grew and flourish throughout the story and none of them ended the story as the same as they had started, which is always a good sign. On the other hand, the antagonists felt rather hollow. They didn't grow all that much and we didn't learn anything worthwhile about them. They were just there to provide suspension and threat.The visual style of this film is something that divides opinions. It's rather bleak and other-worldly, with strong vibrant colours clashing with shades of brown, grey and black. It looks dirty and unpleasant, which fits the tone of the story, but is still somewhat hard to look at for prolonged periods of time. I didn't particularly care for it - except for few particular scenes - but I get its purpose. They way the film is shot also manages to save a lot. Lots of weird camera angles and clever settings make the film interesting to follow.In the end this is a zombie film that every fan of the genre should see. It's not the greatest in its genre by a long shot, but it has good character, suitably brutal action scenes and few storytelling tricks that have since become extremely popular, largely thanks to this film.",28 Days Later...

This man Jim(Cillian Murphy) finds survivors in different locations. With everything down, and people died out, they can survive well without looting because there's no lawmen around the bloody place. Syphoning gas from other vehicles, and trying to find sanctuary is also needed as well. There are more survivors though, but these guys are up to something, and it's not good. The hospital victim does one good deed, that is save the two ladies from the soldiers who captured the infected ones in their quarters. The young girl may have been orphaned, she was still a strong character in the movie. And Selena(Naomi Harris), doesn't play around herself. She watched Jim like a hawk.

I thought the acting was pretty good and they used my horror movie philosophy and didn't bring in any big stars. I thought that Jim could've been a bit more shocked when he had just got out of hospital at the start. It seemed as if he knew what was going on or something. The directing of the movie seemed poor from my point of view. At times it was hard to tell what was happening from the camera angles. Another thing that had me thinking was that when the infected people caught on fire they were fine and could still chase the uninfected but when they were shot a few times they went down. Also the ending was butchered. They could have done so much with that kind of a story for a twist at the end.,28 Days Later...

75,freemantle_uk,How a horror film should be done,9,14 February 2010,"Danny Boyle has proved to be a director who can do almost any genre. He has done dark-comedy, crime, drugs, sci-fi and a children's film, and with 28 Days Later he shows he can do a horror/post-apocalyptic film with chilling consequences. This was also a big success for Fox Spotlight (the only good wing of Fox at the moment): with a $5 Million it made nearly $83 Million and was even more successful in the United States then it was in it's nation UK.28 Days after the release of the rage virus, Britain has become devastated. Main cities are deserted, the inflected, pretty much zombie like people, roam the streets. In London a bike courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma, and is shocked to find London is empty and has no knowledge of the event that has happened. He meets up with two other survivors, Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) who tell him everything that happens. After being chased by inflected, Jim and Selena go to a tower block and meet up with Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). They hear an emergency broadcast from the army to go Manchester and the group quickly head-off. But it not just the inflected that the survivors have to worry about.Danny Boyle teamed up with Alex Garland, a successful novelist, to make a bleak, haunting film about the end of the world. They are strong scenes, like the deserted London, with only hints of what happens. They don't show the collapse of Britain, so leave it up to the audience's imagination. Boyle and Garland also focus on the most important factor in storytelling: character. There are interesting and believable, who have different views about live and the world. Selena is a pessimistic woman who has to be violence to survivor, Jim is a man who thrown into an extraordinary position, and the compelling father daughter relationship between Frank and Hannah. Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) and the army also show what man can do at it's worst. Danny Boyle shows his skill behind camera, using an effective hand-held camera, giving the film a more gritty, realistic felt, adding to the horror of the events. He shows he has a good sense for action, scares and more tender moments, allowing character interaction and revel who people really are. As a horror film it is very effective, even to people who don't like the genre. Boyle and Garland also add some moments of dark comedy to relax the film a tiny bit.They is also a good cast in the film. 28 Days Later brought Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris to the public, and the two have stared in Batman Begins and the second and third Pirates films. But it was Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Eccleston who offered the experience the film needed, particularly Christopher Eccleston as a near mad army officer, like Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now.Garland and Boyle were also influenced by George A. Romero's Living Dead trilogy, with the collapse of society in Dawn of the Dead, the siege environment of Dawn and Night of the Living Dead, and the relationship between the army and civilians was like in Day of the Dead.An excellent horror film.",28 Days Later...
76,Polaris_DiB,Fully formed thriller,10,22 November 2005,"An early movie in the DV release bonanza of our current age of film-making, Boyle's 28 Days Later... is a zombie movie that challenges the automatous hordes of moviegoers to treat them to a movie that first redefines zombies in a new and appealing way, and then proceeds to set them loose in a three-part story arch that explores the depths of humanity's inhumanity to other humans.Most viewers need little experience in the zombie genre to recognize the impact of Romero's infamous zombie trilogy on almost all subsequent zombie thrillers ever after, and while this one definitely has its nods, it takes more inspiration from actual crimes of humanity (Bosnia, Saddam's gassing of the Kurds, an explosion in northern Ireland, Sierra Leone, and Pol Pot, amongst others) and the anxiety of a modern world set to eventually face a great pandemic, and compresses it into a theme of apocalyptic emptiness set to Godspeed You! Black Emperor! Sound good enough yet? It also contains fantastic performances and a huge presentation of substance-based style that pulls together a story arch bound to be entertaining for anyone ranging from zombie-buffs to serious cinema enthusiasts always looking for the next post-modern symbolism launcher.--PolarisDiB",28 Days Later...

The virus soon gets out and pretty much decimates the entire population of London.""28 Days Later,"" we're introduced to the formerly comatose Jim (Cillian Murphy), who wakes up in a deserted hospital and proceeds to walk the eerily silent streets of London. He naturally yells and gets no response (of course, this is not a wise thing to do). A newspaper caught in the wind informs him that a virus got loose and transformed people into madmen.He meets Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) and together the three of them stalk the lonely streets of this dark and dangerous metropolis that's teeming with the deadly ""infected."" They meet Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns) and together, they all set off into the country in search of a possible cure for the virus and safety, which is at an isolated mansion that has been heavily fortified by a loose platoon of soldiers, led by Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston), and soon Jim and party realize that they are up against something much more sinister.""28 Days Later..."" has been dubbed by some genre purists as a ""zombie flick,"" but director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland have insisted it isn't and I'm inclined to agree with them. Though ""28 Days Later..."" was greatly influenced by the works of American director George A. Romero (who made the daring ""Living Dead"" trilogy and basically defined a new genre of horror film-making), it's not a zombie flick because the so-called ""living dead"" in this movie are still technically alive, just... ""infected.""That's about all I'm going to say about that, instead I'm going to turn my focus to the craft and ingenuity that went into this film's production. Even if one wants to call it a zombie flick (I'm not going to disagree with anyone that does), the horror and gore take a backseat to a larger social question about human nature: Is it in our blood to kill?Alex Garland might think so, since the virus has to be in the blood to infect its victim and transform them into what they are in the film. And if someone does get infected, any survivors around have 20 seconds (or is it 30?) to kill them before the infected individual has a chance to wreak havoc.I missed this movie when it laid siege to the theaters last summer and proceeded to scare the daylights out of its viewers. But in today's times, an observant person might assume that this movie provides a valuable commentary about the dangerous days that we're living in. The American people are scared and ""28 Days Later..."" may have provided the jolts we needed to shake us out of our disillusionment with modern times.An MTV (MTV?) special I watched a while ago talked about how people want to be scared out of their wits nowadays; just look at the massive success of movies like ""Cabin Fever"" (another movie about a deadly virus on the loose) or Zack Snyder's remake of Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" which was released earlier this year.""28 Days Later..."" is an eerie and frightening film that I highly recommend to any horror fan or anyone who wants to escape reality and slip into another darker, deadlier one.10/10",28 Days Later...

This movie had a nice balance of drama and horror, these scenes made us care for the characters.

79,runamokprods,Is there any genre Danny Boyle can't do?,8,23 September 2013,"A very well made, thinking person's zombie movie. This avoids most of the silliest elements of the genre, adds some very clever twists, and interesting complex characters. It still doesn't quite rise to being a great movie, through a combination of not really exploring the many political and social themes it hints at (George Romero takes that further), and pushing its internal logic pretty far at times. But it's always entertaining, has a lot of genuine suspense, and isn't over- reliant on easy scares and shocks. Interestingly photographed on video. I would have rated this even higher if it had one of the darker, more emotional and complex endings included on the DVD special features. That would have brought it to 'classic' status.",28 Days Later...
80,drqshadow-reviews,An Undead Evolution,8,10 June 2020,"Danny Boyle rethinks the zombie subgenre, modernizing several of its sillier conventions to create a more pressing, lethal threat. 28 Days Later doesn't discard the pertinent bits - movies about the undead have long depicted desperate survivors as an equal or greater danger - but instead sharpens the axe, so to speak, by cutting out all the shuffling and moaning about brains. These monsters are aggressive, athletic and sharp-witted, an overpowering physical peril that should be evaded, not confronted.That's not the only thing that feels different. One of the first major films to go all-digital, it still comes across as unusually intimate and street-level, especially in comparison to its more refined, traditional big-budget contemporaries. We've seen empty cities and abandoned highways before, but never with such a pervasive sense of stark, haunting reality. Early scenes of an abandoned, wind-swept downtown London, littered with trash and eerily silent, are a major highlight; a chillingly effective method to set the stage without an overwrought narrative explanation.This is a film that excels at such tension - its constant sense of imminence is delicious - even after the enemy changes faces in the third act. A few awkward pieces hold it back from achieving loftier heights (I really didn't need the hammy exposition of the prologue, nor the tacked on feel-good ending), but it's still a daringly effective, and necessary, step forward for the whole category.",28 Days Later...
81,MaxBorg89,"A compelling, artful, very British take on the zombie genre",9,22 April 2007,"Having made his name with dark, grotesque comedies or dramas like Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle didn't seem like an obvious choice for directing a zombie movie. But then again, appearances can be deceiving, and as it turns out, Boyle's gritty, low-budget take on the genre is one of the best horror films to have been produced in the last decade.In fact, the Z-word (as it's lovingly referred to in the hilarious Shaun of the Dead) is never used in the film, perhaps because the director prefers not to call his work a ""zombie film"". Instead, the undead are called ""infected"", as the whole story begins with a raid in a lab, where a very powerful virus is accidentally released. At this point, the scene fades to black, followed by the caption ""28 days later..."" (hence the title). And that's when the movie really kicks in: an average Brit named Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a deserted hospital and goes out in the street to look for help, only to find the whole of London completely abandoned (a truly unsettling sequence), safe for the infected, constantly running (maybe that's where Zack Snyder came up with the idea of fast zombies in the Dawn of the Dead remake) in search of human flesh. Having been saved by the disillusioned (and very tough) Selena (Naomie Harris), Jim decides to join her and her allies in an attempt to find a place where a peaceful life is still an option.At this point, the second part of the movie begins: Jim, Selena and the others run into a bunch of soldiers (led by Christopher Eccleston), who live completely isolated in a military zone while waiting for the situation to improve. At first, the survivors have nothing against staying there. Soon enough, though, they will realize that maybe it isn't the infected they should fear the most, as a dramatic battle for everyone's life starts to take shape...One of the main strengths of 28 Days Later... is Boyle's unpretentious, realistic approach: the hand-held cameras add to the eerie mood, particularly in the film's first half, giving us an otherworldly, but at the same time believable portrait of a dystopian, gloomy England. Also important is the attention to character: where most movies focus on the action scenes, the Trainspotting director is more interested in establishing plausible, affecting relationships between the people he's observing, and in that he is helped by a committed cast, especially Murphy and Harris (plus Brendan Gleeson in a brief, but exhilarating appearance). It is in fact largely thanks to the actors that Boyle manages to get away with a fairly conventional third act (heavily inspired by George Romero's Day of the Dead) and villains that would look stereotyped if played by lesser thespians.Overall it does have a few flaws, but 28 Days Later... is nonetheless a compelling film, and arguably the most interesting British contribution to the horror genre since The Wicker Man.",28 Days Later...

The main disappointment for me is in the choice of format. Digital works fine for short range shots with focus on inner emotions and scenes that are not too highly reliant on visual authenticity for effect, but for an epic of action shots over broad landscapes the definition is sometimes so poor as to be laughable. 28 Days was made on a tiny  well relatively tiny ($15m) - budget and it shows  no doubt it will continue to uphold Danny Boyle's reputation for making small budget films that rake in millions and, like Trainspotting and Shallow Grave that went before it, the editing in 28 Days Later is sharp and punchy, the infected crazies that keep jumping out like Living Dead Zombies on speed are scary enough, and the Mad Max formula that winds up the near two hours post-apolocalyptic mayhem still works well enough if you throw in a few more crazies and an attempted rape. 28 Days Later delivers value-for-money in the shocks department, but ultimately sees you leaving the cinema feeling empty and cheated.",28 Days Later...
83,smatysia,Not your usual film. Check it out.,8,26 April 2004,"Wasn't expecting such a powerful film from people I was not at all familiar with. OK, the quibbles and plot holes first: True enough for those who say ""where are all the cars?"" I would add ""Where are all the corpses?"" When Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakens at the hospital, there should probably have been enough corpses there to clue him in that really bad stuff was going on. And all that death in a city the size of London would likely stink fifty miles away, from masses of rotting food, etc., as well as the dead. Clearly the reason for these omissions was to prolong the character's state of confusion. (And to pay a bit of homage to ""The Omega Man"") And it is never explained why the infected do not attack one another. And there was something weird about the photography that was quite irritating. But, having said all that, not many movies leave me thinking about them three days later, like this one did. Anyone who likes sci-fi, horror, or disaster flicks has to see 28DL.

Thing is before Covid this was just another (albeit good) zombie horror movie, now it hits much closer to home, as I'm watching the daily news reports and crazy events unfold around me, my world getting smaller and smaller with each new restriction the events here felt more plausible or actually able to happen. I wonder if these times will change how I look at all end of days/ disaster movies?Anyways this is from director Danny Boyle, an apocalyptic thriller about a deadly viral outbreak and the resilient Londoners trying to survive in a world of infected, flesh-eating zombies. The (now infamous) opening scenes of our protagonist waking up in the hospital and roaming the empty London streets in his hospital gown trying to figure out WTF is still amazing. Great characters, a good plot, went a bit off the rails for me with the rapey military but up until that point excellent. Brendan Gleeson as the dad with the drop of blood falling into his eye, well done, sad. I'm sure I'll watch this again one day.",28 Days Later...
85,lukem-52760,Hands down the greatest British Horror movie ever!!!! A Masterpiece,10,15 August 2018,"28 days later (2002) is an instant CLASSIC in my opinion, it was a huge hit back when it first hit the cinema in 2002 & i saw it on the big screen & it was so exciting & scary as hell!!!British films in general are not usually that good at all especially Horror movies so when 28 came out i was blown away by this terrifying infection film.This is the greatest ""Infection"" or ""Infected"" film ever made or side by side with Eli Roth's CABIN FEVER, & the greatest Zombie movie ever made is the George Romero 1985 Masterpiece ""Day of the Dead""
My other favourite ""Infected"" movie is Eli Roth's 2002 Cabin Fever & then there's the excellent, Will Smith infection Thriller ""I Am Legend"" all great films in the Infection Sub-genre.The look of the film is amazing, it's very real & very gritty & has a very unsettling atmosphere. The infected people are ridiculously scary lol the make up fx look stunning & no use of c.g.i so it's amazing to look at the infected running through the abandoned London streets!!!There's so much good stuff in this film that makes this a classic Horror movie.28 days later also has that very old school feel to it, that dark & moody gritty low budget approach like those old 70's Horror Thriller films such as SHIVERS (1975) & RABID (1977) two excellent Infected David Cronenberg films & 28 has that feel intentional or not?The cast are excellent & give great performances especially, Cillian Murphy who gives the standout performance here & who became a big Movie star after this in America. Also we an excellent Naomie Harris as the tough & brutal warrior survivor, Salena, also a strong solid performance from the great Brendan Gleeson (Lake Placid) as a good man & father trying to keep his daughter safe & another great performance comes from Christopher Eccleston as a sinister Army captain with scary motives, a superb all British cast of top talent here!!!Naomi Harris pretty much steals the show as the tough-as-hell warrior survivor Selena. This lady is one tough mutha!!! She's hardened to this new Apocalyptic, savage world of chaos with it's rampaging rage-induced infected running around ripping everyone up. Selena is a tough cookie but also smart, world weary & realistic in how she talks & tthinks, a great character to be proud of for a woman in such a heroic lead role where she doesn't need to be saved as She's as deadly as the enemy!!! She looks very 70's in style & super cool with her Machete & long leather coat & bandana she looks like an iconic character & really she is.Danny Boyle has put real characters on the screen that feel real & act probably how you would in that situation. The main guy Jim (Murphy) is such an ordinary guy, he's slim & all natural so he's totally believable & it's a great performance. I loved the small band of survivor's that basically become a little family & share some lovely little tender moments as they travel out of London city in search of a better place & of Course that leads us to another stark, shocking & brutally real part of this Classic, the soldiers. I think Boyle got it so right with how the typical mouthy & pathetic ""Laddy Lads"" soldiers are here. Proper typical British blokes in army gear, exactly how i would imagine them to be & how they act here too. The vile soldiers end up being more of a threat than the infected. What Boyle did is craft a movie about what extremes would you go to in order to survive. Jim's vengeance on the soldiers is a fantastic sequence that is ferocious & bloody & scary but Jim had to do what he had to do.I've watched this so many times since seeing it in the Cinema way bk in 2002 & with each viewing i notice more interesting things & find new meanings to scenes, a very clever Horror movie that's drenched in a gritty, sharp & scary realism.The empty London here looks so scary & menacing, also the music is excellent some times very sad & scary that it captures the loneliness & other times very almost 80's style but always excellent!!!So yes a very surprisingly excellent British infection film by a director that i would Never usually be interested in or watch his films at all!!! I Hated the DEPRESSING & GRIM overrated ""Trainspotting"" & i didn't like ""The Beach""
But his, 28 days later is a great film & is extremely powerful & suspenseful & is actually an important film in the genre.Raw, real & scary as hell, also scarily more relevant each year!!!The greatest ""infected or Virus"" Horror movie ever.True MASTERPIECE.",28 Days Later...

When the group finds that there is really no safe place in the city, they decide to make a mad dash for supplies and then to run for the country-side, hoping that there will be less of a virus-riddled population there.

Unfortunately, the average horror movie is so bad, that this would have to be terrible not to be better. This is actually really good for a horror movie. It has realistic acting, characters we care about, scary antagonist zombies that lead to several heart racing scenes and dialogue that's just fine. The climax is what brought this movie down a notch. It was loud, and nonstop, and everything that defined what the first part of the movie is, is not used in the climax.After an outbreak of an infectious disease, the world's population is moving away from humans and now is being lead by brain dead and blood hungry zombies. Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma 28 days after this disease took hold of the human race. He ends up meeting other survivors, including Selena (Naomie Harris), a tough woman who will kill anyone infected in a split second, Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). These few survivors go off to find more survivors and end up finding a military base where the study these zombie creatures by chaining them up. Chaos ensues when one gets loose.The first part and good portion of this movie is different from most horror films. It's quiet, except for zombie attacks which will catch you by surprise, and the characters act very reserved, but it's not boring. It's like a character study, and the characters are interesting. Instead of showing lots of zombie violence (which it does have some), it's more about the characters and how they're coping and what they're thinking. Once on the military base, this movie takes a turn for the worse. It grows overly violent, and the climax is equivalent to a bunch of loud screaming while throwing blood and guts at the camera. This type of climax works better in comically violent films, such as Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" or Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead II"", but here it's a step in the wrong direction. Then we get to the ending. It may not be anything new, but it's an effective and good ending.I enjoyed everything about this movie, except for the climax. But even with a climax like this has, this is an exceptional zombie movie. The acting and writing are realistic and the characters created are ones we care about. The direction is good, as is the camera direction. Much better than the sequel this movie produced. Overall, this is a similar plot (The Omega Man) but it brings enough new to the genre to make it a success.My rating: *** out of ****. 113 mins. R for violence and language.",28 Days Later...

And so the pandemic breaks out. 28 days later Jim wakes up in a hospital, just to find it deserted. The bike-messenger, put in the hospital by an accident, takes to the streets to find them deserted as well. Well almost deserted, in a church, the priest suddenly attacks him, screaming unintelligibly. Jim flees and get unexpected help, and soon learns that only a few persons are still sane and uninfected. But a radio-message brings hope that there still is disease-free areas...Comments: Unfortunately it is glaringly apparent that the background story is just an bad excuse to explain empty streets and the existence of zombiemonsters. The inserted gap between the release and Jim's awakening, lets the story ignore questions as how the virus works and spreads widely, and why no response is working. When Jim wakes up, it is just there, and might as well always been. Then we get a movie full of zombie/monster attacks, blood splatter so forth and so on, until the crew felt they had enough material to fill a movie. Insert another black time jump, and now everything is fine again. To conclude, the story itself has no clues as to answer any questions about the foundation it tries to build upon, and if you have one (question that is), the entire movie falls apart.And unfortunately there is no suspense or development in the movie either, as the story aren't really trying to go anywhere.

I was skeptical about the use of the digital camera, but in the end, it proved to be a wonderful device for this particularly gritty and slightly off kilter zombie film. While the whole zombie genre has fallen on hard times, 28 Days Later presents the subgenre in a way that seems more modern and timely as opposed to some random curse or some explanation that doesn't make any real sense. And the emotions displayed in the movie are so realistic and carnal, one can't deny the idea of these type of actions taking place. What I especially liked about this film was the care and devotion the film makers went through to make this film look authentic and real. With the exception of one shot, the empty streets of London look as barren and hopeless as the continuation of mankind. Cillian Murphy was positively wicked in his role as Jim, and the rest of the cast was absolutely stellar in their simple (yet complex) character arcs. For those that love the horror genre, this is certainly one for the ages, one that will hopefully allow the horror genre to right itself.",28 Days Later...

Despite a hopeful beginning, the answer is NO.  Aside from the extremely annoying music-video edits during the action scenes (which signify that this is, in fact, a zombie movie for the NEW MILLENNIUM), there isn't much in 28DL that hasn't been borrowed from another source.  The trans-generational, ethnic mix of heroes (including, yes, a black female survivalist) echoes ""Night of the Living Dead""--only here, the characters are weakly-drawn caricatures.  The 'zombie disease' theme was mined in ""The Omega Man.""  And the critique of the military as a harsh, dictatorial outfit was handled better in ""Day of the Dead"" and ""The Crazies.""  The script doesn't expand on these themes in an attempt to create something new--it just recycles them, and had me wishing I was home watching one of the aforementioned movies instead.4/10",28 Days Later...
96,aidanratesmovies,Meh,5,12 August 2021,"Dull at times, with occasional charm- 28 Days Later is a zombie film that doesn't quite know what to do with its interesting premise- and quite honestly feels shallow because of it. I feel like this film is kinda all over the place, especially when it comes to tone. There are times where the film just suddenly wants to act like a comedy, or a drama, or a action flick even- and none of it really works together. It all feels rather out of place, and its grittier directing style makes the film even more awkward at times. The characters towards the end of the film are also rather generic- and quite honestly frustrated me at times. The film can also feel quite a bit dull at times, although thankfully it does have some charming moments. Although it's not even, I did like the concepts and some of the ideas fleshed out on screen throughout the film. I thought Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris both proved to be rather charming leads and certainly gave the film a bigger heart at times. The cinematography is creative and even iconic at times, and the score is absolutely brilliant- providing a unique view of this world that I feel often captures the vibe of the film better than the script could. In the end, 28 Days Later is a misfire, but it's hardly the worst zombie film out there. It has its decent moments, but it's hardly memorable enough to deserve its praise- let alone a second watch.My Rating: 5.4/10.",28 Days Later...
97,ShootingShark,Eerie But Slightly Disappointing Zombie / Killer Virus British Horror Flick,5,26 March 2006,"Jim is the victim of an auto crash who wakes up after twenty-eight days in a deserted London hospital. Unable to find anybody, he wanders the streets, is attacked by some frenzied people and rescued by a woman called Selena. She explains that a virus has wiped out British civilisation. Hearing a radio broadcast, they head north to see if they can find any other survivors, and any hope of a future.This is a film of two halves; the first is a frightening, authentic-looking and spine-tingling odyssey, as our hero wakes up to an apocalypse and stumbles numbly through the ruined streets of Westminster, trying to grasp the enormity of the situation and find a focus. The second half, set in a stately home taken over by a makeshift platoon of dumbbell army squaddies, unfortunately turns into a formulaic series of standard horror scenes. There's a lot to recommend this though - despite a low budget, the deserted London scenes are eerie and impressive, as Murphy crosses Westminster Bridge and walks up Whitehall to The Mall with nobody around. The performances are good, the atmosphere is grim (except for the surprisingly bland and upbeat ending), the horror is treated seriously and the ""infected"" people are shot with weird spastic camera movements that turn them into human versions of the old Tasmanian Devil cartoons. There were a few too many gaps for me in Alex Garland's script though - I'd have liked to know more about the virus (are the victims dead, do they eat and if so what, are they capable of rational thought), the action is flashy but insubstantial, and Jim's transformation in the last two reels into a manic acrobatic assassin is just plain stupid. This is Day Of The Triffids meets Day Of The Dead, and is reminiscent of many other more enjoyable films (Night Of The Comet, Lifeforce, The Quiet Earth, etc), but is still a decent horror movie with some grown-up scares.",28 Days Later...

100,rosscinema,Respectable sci-fi,6,25 July 2003,"I had heard a lot about this film prior to seeing it but I still was not sure what to expect and after viewing it I came away thinking I watched something that was fairly good but certainly not anything I haven't seen before. Story starts out in England where a bunch of activists break into a lab to take pictures of the chimpanzees that are being experimented on and they let one go and it attacks the first person it comes across. Turns out the chimps are infected with a ""Rage"" virus that spreads by bites or contact with blood or saliva. 28 days later a bicycle messenger named Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in the hospital all alone and starts walking the streets of London finding no one. He discovers in a church a bunch of zombies that start chasing him and he runs into two other survivors named Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) who help him. One night they are attacked again and Mark is cut. Selena quickly kills him and explains to Jim that you have only 10 to 20 seconds to kill someone after they are infected. Later they spot lights in a building and go to check it out and they find a man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Through a hand crank radio they listen to a radio signal that says all survivors should come to their compound for safety. The four of them pile into Franks cab and head to where the signal stated to go. Along the way Frank becomes infected and is shot by the military men outside of the compound. Inside they meet Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) who with his band of men have barricaded themselves into an area for survival. Soon they learn that Selena and Hannah are to be used for breeding purposes to continue the race. The film is directed by Danny Boyle who also helmed ""Train-spotting"" and he again shows a good visual flair in his films no matter how low budget. This film is shot with digital cameras and it gives it a realistic documentary feel that reminded me of some of Steven Soderbergh's films like ""Traffic"". The story is very reminiscent of ""Last Man on Earth"" and its remake ""The Omega Man. In fact, in ""The Omega Man"" Charlton Heston teams up with a black female and that is exactly what happens here. The best performance in this film comes from Harris who shows a strong screen presence and it will be interesting to watch her career develop. She steals every scene she is in and she's a definite up and comer. This film doesn't really offer anything that we have not seen before and I kept waiting for something different to occur but it never happens. There are some questions that never get answered like why don't the zombies just feed on one another? And how long does it take before they die of starvation? This film has nothing new to offer but it is competently made with an effective visual style that enhances the many quiet scenes that take place. Along with the performance of Harris I found this an adequate science fiction film that fans of this genre should definitely check out. Nothing thought provoking, but effective in its own way.",28 Days Later...
101,nycritic,An Emotion Infects a Nation.,9,9 May 2005,"A film that at time plays like a frenzied docudrama, 28 DAYS LATER... is unrelenting, grim, horrific, and completely nightmarish. Images of violence against humans dominates the screen for a few minutes, and we soon learn these are televisions mounted against a wall, broadcasting non-stop footage of the inhuman things people do to one another. A monkey lies strapped down, facing these images, helpless. There are others in cages nearby. A band of environmentalists break in, predictably to free these imprisoned monkeys, but a conflict ensues as a scientist barges in and warns them it would be completely insane to do so -- they're infected with Rage. However, since scientists normally equal evil corporations and dehumanized technology known for cruelty not only against animals but humans, they proceed to free one of the apes... and total pandemonium breaks loose as the monkey viciously attacks its freer, and in seconds we see her eyes have become red. She is an infected.And this is the simple setup for a movie that in 100 minutes frightens the pants of even a jaded person. To see shots of a deserted London magnified by shots of abandoned vehicles, overturned equipment, and a haunting collage of missing persons that recalls the scores of photos of the missing that did not survive the 9 - 11 attacks, is extremely disturbing and unsettling and made me squirm in my seat as Cillian Murphy's character Jim walks around town, having awaken about a month later from a coma. It's not reassuring for him to know he may be the only surviving person in the city, and soon he learns there are others out there... but not reasonable, frightened people as much as ferocious predators who will rip the flesh right off you, and if mercy takes over, you may die right there and then, because it only takes 20 seconds for full infection to take over and turn you into a raving monster.That he is saved at the last minute by others who have survived the madness is his saving grace. These are Naomi Harris as Selena and Noah Huntley as Mark, who brief Jim on what happened in haunting monologues, and that Danny Boyle stays focused on Huntley's face as he relates to Jim his own story is flashback enough: it only heightens the terror that swept London and that is still alive and well. This prompts Jim to go visit his parents, maybe hoping they are still alive, and after a near-fatal encounter with an infected there in which Mark does not survive (Selena, absolutely committed to survive this, hacks him to pieces after quickly noticing he's been infected), they barely manage to escape more infected before meeting two other people, a bearish man and his daughter (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns). They have been listening to scattered transmissions that are indicating Manchester holds a possible refuge for survivors.Once they make the decision to leave to Manchester the movie takes a turn and becomes a road film and involved a harrowing if somewhat implausible escape from London through a tunnel, where even the rats are running away from the sheer horror these barely seen people have become. That they eventually meet this fort in an already destroyed Manchester gives them little reassurance, which proves to be true as a small band of military guys lead by Christopher Eccleston have dubious intentions with the women.And here is where Danny Boyle cleverly turns an apocalyptic movie into a study of the human race: can the people who are supposedly meant to protect us be actually worse than the ones who have fallen to a devastating plague? The answer, quite simply, turns out to be yes. That this makes Jim do a much needed transition from dazed youth to fierce survivor drives the point even more home: Rage wiped out most of the population, as a virus, but in given circumstances, is found quite well within us, and Jim becomes so filled with it at one climactic sequence it takes Selena a second before reacting that he hasn't yet been infected.This is a very tense film. There are moments of quietude in a field, where sleep comes uneasy, and even that moment to me was worse than any of the moments when the infected actually sped out and after any of the characters. Seen in stroboscopic images, they becomes even more frightening than if seen as lumbering idiots. If the ending seems a little too upbeat, maybe it's only the decision Boyle and the screenwriters took after having us gone through so much gut-wrenching tension and clear calls, that it was only fair to have Jim, Selena, and Hannah survive and see a glimmer of hope at the end. Other than that, 28 DAYS LATER compresses the battles with good and evil in a world gone wild instead of going all over the place with too many characters like THE STAND and many others do. Intelligent, repulsive at times, unbearable, this was one of the best films of 2003. The DVD release has some nice extras, like alternate endings, deleted scenes, for those into investigating further into Boyle's dark tale.",28 Days Later...
102,Rob_Taylor,London never looked better!,7,15 April 2003,"Given that I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic movies it wasn't much of a surprise to me that I liked this film. Sure, it's low-budget and the storyline is very low key - no planet saving heroics a la Reign of Fire here - but it still kept me entertained nonetheless.It's also far from original, though, and borrows quite heavily from Romero's ""Dead"" series of films. But considering we live in an era where they are remaking such untouchable classics as ""The Italian Job"" and ""Casablanca"" I don't think a bit of plagiarism goes amiss here and there.There are plot holes, but none so glaring as the aformentioned Reign of Fire's plot craters. But on the whole it's a solid piece of work and a worthy addition to the post-apocalypse genre. Although it's received some negative comments, I actually liked the DV nature of the production which gave the movie a grittier look to it. And I thought London had never looked better, frankly!",28 Days Later...
103,Matt_Layden,"""Disappointing attempt at reviving a dying genre""",6,22 September 2005,"A powerful virus escapes from a British research facility. Transmitted in a drop of blood, the virus infects those and turns them into a zombie like creature. Within 28 days the country is overwhelmed and a handful of survivors begin their attempts to salvage a future, little realizing that the deadly virus is not the only thing that threatens them.Here is a little film that could have been a jump start in the horror genre, but with it's 2nd act, it falls apart as it tries to be something more then it actually is. It sells itself as an end of the world, fight for our lives film, and does that successfully for the most part, but when it takes a turn into a more humane state, it fizzles out and loses any interest it once had.Don't get me wrong, I loved the field scene, that was tremendous, the cinematography was really great. The deserted London was probably one things in this movie, that make it watchable. I liked how they weren't you ""typical"" slow moving ""grrr"" zombies, but blood-coughing, running marathon zombies. IF you would call them zombies, or just people infected with ""RAGE"" The military characters are the worse, with the British soldiers being nothing more than your typical foul-mouthed grunts. The clever use of dialogue in ""Dog Soldiers"" was fast and hip, but still built characters, here it most definitely does not.What does set this apart from your other zombie type movies is of course is isolated in London feel to it. The main character wakes up naked, sort of reborn, and finds himself in a new world where people are infected with a virus called rage, that turns them into a zombie like creature. It;s nice to see what people would do in this situation, and we get varies degrees of that.Our heros were in more trouble with other humans then they were with the creatures. By the time we got to the climax you were cheering on the Zombies. I thought the love story felt forced because ""every"" movie needs a love story and I found nothing at all to be thought provoking because it had all been done before. One thing I found odd was the lack of security when the ""activists"" liberate the chimps.Since I had such high hopes for this film and was totally astonished at how terrible the last 20 or so minutes of the film was, a horrible ending did the movie in for me, it became the most disappointing movie of the summer.",28 Days Later...
104,lewiskendell,What would happen if science unlocked the true rage of humanity?,8,19 June 2010,"28 Days Later is the sci-fi horror thriller that brought zombies back to the mainstream in style. It and the Dawn of the Dead remake were mostly responsible for putting zombies back in the mind of the general movie going public, and making them actually exciting again.This is a very British movie, and the style reflects that. It has a measured pace in some places, and the occasional humor is very dry. But when the action hits, it hits hard and it is frantic. It's an exciting film, to say the least.There are a few recognizable faces here, but none of the actors involved were big stars at the time it was made. Which is great, because it would be a very different movie if it was just a vehicle for an actor or actress. 28 Days Later is more about the potential violence and rage in ordinary humans, than it is about the infected who have brought so much destruction to England. That's one aspect of the many that gives it appeal beyond the traditional audience of zombie flicks. Great movie.",28 Days Later...

Now it is a very sober and powerful movie, but I'm convinced that if some Hollywood director lays his hands on it, this movie will be full of gore, explosions and other things that would make this movie a lot worse. From the beginning until the end this movie was able to fascinate me, thanks to the excellent music, the interesting way of filming, the nice acting, the very good story,...The movie starts with some environmental activists who have broken into a test lab where chimps are being used as guinea-pigs for all kinds of scientific experiments. What they don't know is that the apes have been infected by a virus that causes rage. They set one free and it immediately attacks one of it's liberators, contaminating her with the virus... 28 days later we meet Jim. Jim is a young bicycle courier in London who has been in a coma because of a car accident. When he wakes up from his coma, the hospital where he's being treated is empty, as is the entire city of London. At first he thinks there is no living soul left in the city, until he finds some people in an abandoned church... all infected by the virus (which he doesn't know yet of course). He gets out alive and meets some other non-infected people. Together they will try to survive and to find more uninfected people.""28 Days Later..."" is a very good movie, but I'm sure that it will not be loved by people who like zombie movies or other gory stuff. It has nothing to do with that and I'm very glad about that. I find zombie movies rather lame and stupid to be honest, but I definitely can't say the same about this movie. This one is absolutely great and underrated by many... It's full of suspense, it's blood-chilling, it has an apocalyptic feeling and is more than just another slasher/zombie/horror flick...

107,screenman,Highly Overrated.,5,24 February 2009,"It began with a very interesting premise of a young man waking-up all by himself in a chaotic hospital. I dunno how long he'd been out, or how he alone got overlooked, and why he hadn't died of dehydration, the disease, or whatever, but it left a number of big question-marks to juggle with. This intro was pioneered by John Wyndam in his 'Day Of The Triffids', so it was nothing new.The scenes of a deserted capital were extremely dramatic and well done - better even than the 'Triffids' movie. But this dimwit aimlessly wandering about in his hospital pyjamas with a vacant stare, left me wondering who were the real zombies. Getting your kit on before going outdoors would surely have been foremost in his mind. Then again; he was a cycle courier so perhaps we shouldn't expect too much. Even so; his total lack of interaction quickly became a bore. And it was highly unlikely that he could have walked right across central London in his condition. He'd have been pooped within a few hundred yards.And I'm afraid it quickly went downhill after that. Movies about extremely ordinary people may be realistic but they can also be very, very dull. This item slouched about on the edge of a soap-opera canyon.From time to time things livened-up when the 'zombie-flesh-eater' type things kept pouncing, but really - how many living dead movies do we actually need? It's old hat, for Gawd's sake.And that was about it. The story dwindled away as each unprepossessing goody died-off. Even after I thought it had ended; the movie, like the dead, coughed back into life again. When, in truth, the last rites had been said within 30 minutes of the intro.Britain just doesn't do this kind of stuff very well any more. Even with the considerable budget that this work must have enjoyed, you can find far superior efforts funded by comparatively tiny budgets from years gone by. Just think of the 'Quatermass' movies of the 1950's or how about 'Village Of The Damned'? This came over too much like 'Flood': a well packaged empty container.The first half-hour is well worth a look, but don't get too comfortable.",28 Days Later...
108,brando647,A Modern Take on the Classic Zombie Genre,8,27 December 2009,"Zombie movies need something fresh to keep my attention and Danny Boyle has done just that. Instead of the stereotypical shambling undead, Boyle has put his own spin on the genre, avoiding complete cliché while still paying homage to the zombie masters that came before him. The film establishes itself 28 days following an outbreak in London of the rage virus, a mutated form of Ebola passed through blood and saliva in which afflicted become mindlessly violent. The infected are still living and fully mobile, but they appear to lose all higher brain functions and rely solely on aggressive instinct. So, the ""zombies"" in Boyle's film retain some of the classic attributes (such as their brainless nature and the attacks on the uninfected) while integrating a modern scientific angle, playing on the current societal fears of disease and biological weapons.While the movie can be considered a zombie film, I would classify it more as a survival thriller. The focus isn't as much as surviving waves of infected, but follows a group of four as they make their way through a desolate English landscape, avoiding the infected as best as possible and dealing with an even greater danger when they encounter an isolated military outpost. The concept of humans being more dangerous than the infected isn't new, but Boyle does a great job here and it creates a tense final act to the film.Cillian Murphy was great as the main character, Jim, who we first discover as he awakes from a coma and finds the entire city eerily deserted (making for one of the coolest sequences in the film). He is soon joined by Selena (Naomie Harris), Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and Frank's daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Gleeson always makes for a great film presence and Harris was a strong counter to Murphy's optimistic outlook. I found the greatest performance came from Christopher Eccleston as Major Henry West, the head of the military outpost. He comes off as charming and you want to trust him in his position of authority but you soon find he is as corrupt as those who follow his orders.Boyle's film is a zombie film without being a zombie film. The cast do a good job of creating complex characters and you always find yourself hoping they pull through. Boyle's film helped pave the way for the modern zombie cinema, in which the iconic masses aren't necessarily slow-shambling flesh-eaters, but frighteningly effective animals. 28 DAYS LATER is light on scares, but instead focuses on the suspense and tension around finding yourself in such an apocalyptic scenario and for that, I think it's great.",28 Days Later...

And I must add that the direction is exactly what you would expect from 'Danny Boyle' top class.For me though the real difference between this movie and many others made in this genre is as follows - The infected (the zombie like folk) are more menacing, they turn instantly and they move fast, a combination that would instill fear in every one of us.I don't mean to run down the zombie movie genre - I am a huge fan of most of these films, but lets be honest its been done to death, re-animated and done again, and this was the first movie to break the mould and transcend to a new level.If you like your horror flicks, then this is certainly worthy of your attention.9/10",28 Days Later...
112,sme_no_densetsu,A modern horror classic,8,8 July 2014,"Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" arrived at a time when zombies in film and TV weren't nearly as popular as they are today. The movie reinvigorated the zombie sub-genre through its unique spin on the creatures that departed from traditional representations.Here, the 'zombies' (who are never referred to as such in the film) are human beings infected with a virus that turns them into mindless, raging brutes. Thus, they represent a significant deviation from the shambling monstrosities popularized by George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"".The movie is set in England and takes place 28 days after the introduction of the virus into the population. At that time the country has mostly been evacuated, which leads to an eerie sense of desolation in the early stages of the film. This effectively sets the stage for the chaos to come. From there, the movie mostly steers clear of cliché horror devices and makes good use of an intelligent script.The cast is a well assembled unit headed by Cillian Murphy. Brendan Gleeson makes a memorable appearance in support, as does Christopher Eccleston. Naomie Harris also proves capable in the lead female role.Danny Boyle's direction is as appealing as always but the use of digital cameras resulted in a not especially attractive look, mainly due to the lower resolution in comparison to film. Meanwhile, the movie's score and soundtrack, while effective, are rarely as memorable as in other Boyle efforts.Overall, ""28 Days Later"" is an effective horror movie with considerable artistic flair.

Sexy and nude Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) stars as Jim a young man whom awakes out of a coma after a pandemic and discovers that most of the survivors left are infected with a rage virus which drives them crazy and drives them to attack and infect others. The plot is quite similar to so many. Mostly like every zombie movie ever made. Along the way he meets some survivors which include a truly bad ass Naomie Harris (Pirates of the Carribean 2&3) and they try and find help. A radio broadcast leads them to a group of soldiers with questionable intentions. There's nothing really new here plot wise but the execution is creatively stunning. The grainy, sort if found footage style easily immerses you into the events on screen and it's both terrifying and addictive.

I didn't get around to seeing it until a few days ago and I gotta feel like that was somewhat of an embellishment on the promoters' part.When environmental terrorists attack a lab that contains diseased chimps who are infected with a ""Rage"" virus, they unwittingly let loose a plague that lays waste to England and(perhaps)the rest of society. The 28 Days later of the title cuts to a mostly abandoned London where a coma-tized bicycle courier named Jim(Cillian Murphy,effective) wakes from his stasis to find himself alone in a hospital. As he searches London for signs of life,he is rescued from raging zombies by a couple of survivalists(one of them,the lovely Naomie Harris)who he follows from place to place to keep alive. From there,he also meets a man and his daughter(Brendan Gleeson,terrific,and Megan Burns,good)and they try to find a refuge out of London-town. A recorded message of a ""paradise"" where ""salvation"" can be found is tracked by Frank(the man) on his shortwave radio.This film feels more like a meditation on what happens to people when they are reduced to their lowest elements. A friend of mine told me that this movie's running zombies was what inspired the zombies in the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"",but where ""Dawn of..."" was pretty much a full-throttle action/horror hybrid from about start to finish,this film plays more like a ""What if..."" movie,with less emphasis on the creatures themselves and more on the (lucky?) survivors.

There's very little original in it. Some of the similarities were quite obvious: THE OMEGA MAN has Heston fighting the vampire/zombies (who only appear at night) with a black woman. In THE QUIET EARTH, Bruno Laurence is seen naked on a bed, almost like the scene in 28DL. Bruno also walks around a deserted city with messages written all over the place. In Tobe Hooper's LIFEFORCE, London is devastated by aliens and the whole city is filled with crazed zombies running amok. There's even a scene with a church filled with dead people/zombies. Like whoa! This pointless film also reminded me of REIGN OF FIRE, a recent & really bad movie set in a post-apocalyptic London. The tone of both films were pretty much the same: I couldn't care less over what might happen to the boring characters.Seriously, 28 DAYS LATER is extremely derivative and it reminded me a lot of the Roland Emmerich & INDEPENDENCE DAY school of filmmaking: take your ideas for your script from every film or book imaginable. Everyone has made fun of Roland Emmerich or other Hollywood filmmakers for doing this and yet many have applauded Danny Boyle for doing the very same thing because it's a ""low budget"" independent movie. Yeeesh. Well not me. This movie is redundant and because I've seen all of the films mentioned above, I didn't like 28DL simply because I've been there and done that.",28 Days Later...

Although not completely realistic, it is close to that, giving us insight into one possible outcome. Not perfect, has many amateur, fake, boring parts and acts, but still better than most movies because it is more real and has better topic. Also good because it shows us many locations, all taken from real world, which additionally motivates us to watch. Bit emotional. Best part for me was feelings of hope, for example seeing aircraft two times, which give us good feelings at the end and bit before it. Looks like this may have a better sequel.",28 Days Later...
118,brchthethird,"""Documentary realism"" take on the zombie genre which is a little boring",5,5 May 2016,"The zombie genre, honestly, is an overpopulated one. What, with THE WALKING DEAD and numerous recent attempts to cash in on the craze, it's a little hard to separate oneself from the crowd when in the shadow of what George Romero already did. 28 DAYS LATER came at the early end of this recent uptick in zombie films and does manage to differentiate itself, mainly through a straightforward, ""realistic"" take that recasts zombies as humans infected with a virus. The only problem I found with this approach is that it robs the material of much potential for social commentary. I also found the choice to film on digital video a rather irritating one, giving the film a gritty, but cheap, look. At times, even the dialogue was difficult to make out. I also had took issue with the pacing, as roughly the first half of the film could have been streamlined a little bit in order to get Cillian Murphy's character from the hospital where we find him, to the family meets, and finally to the military base where second half takes place. Quite frankly, the film is kind of boring until he meets other survivors. For me, the second half is where the real meat of the film lies, and you get to see how in the event of a massive traumatic event, humanity reverts to brute (and uncouth) methods of survival. Here, Christopher Eccleston as the base commander, delivers what I think is the best performance of the film. The other cast members do fine, but there was little to latch onto as far as character development was concerned. As for the horror elements, I thought action and gore were well-handled, but the frame-dropping or speed-ramping was a little bit annoying. There was also some tricky editing going on to make things seem more intense than they really were. Some people might like that, but I typically don't. Ultimately, I ended up with about half of a good movie. It's not terrible, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the results either.",28 Days Later...

Cillian Murphy is excellent too.Well worth the watch!",28 Days Later...
120,jaredmobarak,That was longer than a heartbeat28 Days Later,8,13 May 2007,"In anticipation for the sequel 28 Weeks Later, I decided to revisit the superb zombie entry 28 Days Later from director Danny Boyle. I remember back to when I first started hearing the buzz about this film and how surprised I was that it came from the guy who brought us Trainspotting and A Life Less Ordinary. However, because this was the guy who made those films, I decided to give it a try, as I am not the hugest fan of the zombie flick or even horror in general. As far as these films go, though, 28 Days Later has got to be my favorite entry to the genre. It could be that there is an actual story involved and an intelligence that is usually lacking in favor of gore and sex, or it could be that this film isn't really very much a zombie film per se at all. The movie is not about humanity surviving against a race of undead beings, but instead about man fighting man, as they always have. The only thing these infected beings bring to the forefront is that rage inside us all, on the surface and unable to be suppressed behind a falsely neutral façade.Our zombies here are not dead and living to kill. The victims have been infected by a virus, which makes pure rage takeover their bodies. One does not need to be dead in order to become a zombie; all that is needed is a drop of blood or saliva to enter the bloodstream. Whether through a cut, your mouth, your eye, or any other exposed orifice, one tiny drop is all it takes for you to crave murder and flesh. Thankfully some people have stayed behind in England to survive and try to find others who have luckily escaped exposure. Our heroes are than common people striving to get through the horror that is happening all around them. Cillian Murphy plays our lead protagonist, helping out his new cynical friend Selena (played realistically by Naomie Harris who has been seeing more and more roles since), yet holding on to his feelings of compassion and needing to help others. Selena is very in the open about her own survival and the fact that when push comes to shove, it is her neck she will save. Murphy's character Jim tries to bring a bit of humanity back to her, tries to subvert the carnage she has seen that has darkened her soul. I believe this is the true crux of the story right herewhat is the point of saving humanity from extinction if you can't see the invaluable worth of the life of those around you?You cannot survive alone. This moral comes up often in the film and really drives it during the numerous stretches without zombies. True, the action scenes are completely riveting throughout, the quick paced editing and sharp movements of blood and violence are harrowing to watch, and the chase scene in the tunnel while trying to change a flat tire gets the pulse running high. However, it's the quiet points really allow the story to mean something with the viewer. The relationship between Brendan Gleeson's father and Megan Burns' daughter are heartbreaking moments. They are only alive because they have each other, someone to love and survive with within the growing isolation and loneliness surrounding them. Their bond shows what living is about and helps break the harsh façade Harris' character has built up to cope. Each does their hardest to never give up hope and their emotions run high at times, but also have show lapses of joy and happiness to counteract it all. I love the scene at the supermarket when they go shopping for food. Gleeson's rant about good wine and his leaving the credit card at the end brought a much- needed smile to my face and totally entrenched my attention into what would soon happen afterwards.It is the end that brings up the political connotations of what has happened and the necessities of life. Whereas most zombie films end with the military coming in and saving everyone from death, here Boyle subverts that into a more telling truthcynical yes, but true nonetheless. These army men, led by a fantastic role of duality from Christopher Eccleston, have created a bunker to try and rebuild society with. Their answer to the zombies is to arm themselves and make a life inside their quarantined home. This is a military state, however, and a utilitarian one. In order to recreate society you need procreation to keep the generations going. With only two female characters in the movie, you can imagine where this goes.Sure the ending becomes a bit too much like your run of the mill actioner, but overall, one cannot ask for more from it. You learn what it is to survive and that you need to have a reason to live and someone to live with. Murphy and Harris deliver the goods during their fight to get out of their island prison. You see, as we later find out, the virus has been contained on the island. England has been quarantined from the rest of the world and sacrificed in order for society to continue on unfettered. The infected are dying of starvation, and salvation seems to have finally come. Now if that doesn't scream sequel, I don't know what does. Hopefully Boyle's producing credit on the follow-up will mean quality and a keeping of tone as well as meaning from this well-done original.",28 Days Later...
121,hall895,Standard zombie fare,6,3 June 2005,"28 Days Later is a zombie film that really doesn't have much of anything remarkable about it. It's certainly not terrific, but it's certainly not awful either. It's just kind of there. The film has a fascinating premise, some startling visuals and a few moments of mild terror. But it never really rises above the mundane, there's nothing that makes it truly stand out from the pack.28 Days Later follows Jim, played by Cillian Murphy, who awakes from a 28-day coma to find London completely deserted. The shots of the deserted city, with the perfect music to match, are haunting, probably the most memorable thing about the film. Jim will soon find the city is in fact not completely deserted as he comes upon a pack of zombies with murderous intentions. Rescued by a young man and woman, Jim will learn that all of London, indeed it seems all of Britain and possibly the world, has been infected with a rage virus that turns them into these murderous creatures. We soon meet a father and a daughter who have also managed to survive. The father is played by Brendan Gleeson, the most recognizable face in a film featuring mainly unknowns.The small band of survivors eventually make their way to Manchester where the film gets somewhat bogged down. It's almost as if the zombies become forgotten and we acquire some new villains who are all too human, all too normal and all too dull. Eventually things begin to move towards what is ultimately a rather unsatisfying conclusion. The film has some great visuals, some fine performances, including that of relative unknown Naomie Harris as Selena, one of Jim's companions on his journey, and a great story to tell. But what started with a great premise and the promise of some genuine thrills in the end falls rather flat. 28 Days Later goes out not with a bang but with a whimper.",28 Days Later...
122,CitizenCaine,Virus causes rampage,7,19 September 2003,"I'm not a big fan of horror movies; because, there are usually wide gaps in logic or questionable character motivations or actions that ruin things. However, I did not see that happening in this movie. The characters are very realistic people, who have been reduced to survivalist mode as a result of a virus unleashed in the London area. The three classic conflicts are all present and accounted for here: man vs. man, man vs. nature, and man vs. himself. People that are writing reviews of this movie, complaining that it's not realistic, know little about human nature. All we have to do is remember mobs of people in concerts and soccer matches around the world to see how we behave over nothing. Now imagine a world where your very survival depends upon almost how vicious you can be in an instant simply to defend yourself and stay alive. There are several scenes that stand out: the flat tire scene and the infection of one of the principals among them. The introduction of the pseudo-army characters into the story is far more realistic than what most people will realize. Survivors are not all ""everyman"" people like ourselves. There are always people that are trying to play ""king of the hill"" in society; the thirst for control and power over others is a very human trait, although one of our basest. It would manifest itself, I think, even under the circumstances proposed in this movie, although it is admittedly a horrible thought. The film itself has a documentary feel to it, backed by eerie music in the background. Although this is a lower budget effort to begin with, the director wisely avoided any big name actors; this is exactly the type of movie that could be ruined by star performances. I see there are numerous complaints about the different endings. I did not see the ""original"" ending either. The theater did not show it after the credits, like so many others seemed to have done. However, knowing what the other ending is doesn't change my enjoyment of what has gone on before. I do agree that the original ending is probably more consistent in tone with the movie than the ending I saw. *** of 4 stars.",28 Days Later...

124,Stampsfightclub,Brillaince from Boyle in good horror,8,17 March 2009,"After a group of activists unleash rage infected apes, Britain becomes home to those infected with the virus, wiping out everybody in their way and for a group of survivors, they must do anything to survive.28 days later is a mix of strong intelligent thinking, an artistic approach to direction and an endless spinning narrative that engages viewers right in to the very core of the gritty and energetic film that is Danny Boyle's work of genius.A horror is a horror usually for the appearance of an abnormal being or 'monster' and here we see a human preaching concept of animal rights gone horribly wrong when the 'rage' virus affects people. What the cross brings are humans with blood thirsty traits, an inability to go out in daylight and constant appetite. Many have argued the creatures are zombies but these creations feel more personal and have way too much energy and thirst to be stereotyped as such creatures. The fact that they can affect a person by way of simple touch is scary and whilst this isn't as gripping as it had the potential to be, the physiological effect of these beings is sustained throughout the two hours.Danny Boyle is a genius. The recent Oscar winner (Slumdog Millionaire) is able to maintain the thrill factor whilst also capturing the scenes in an unforgivably picturesque way. The filming of this picture is perhaps the finest ever made in Britain. The M1 had to be closed, the main road near Big Ben was shut and these are just a few examples of effort the team went in and considering these shots are only a couple of minutes long, it goes to show how appreciative and remarkable this film is.The scenery is unbelievable. Who would have though our country could have been so picturesque? Boyle's sweeping landscape shots are to die for and the thrill factor in the chases is to live for, consistent and perhaps one of the finest directed British films.Murphy, Harris, Gleeson and Burns all do themselves justice without being too screamy and abnormal as most protagonists in the genre today.The sequel 28 weeks later though not directed by Boyle maintains that level of sublime scenery and adrenaline soaked excitement with a core desperate and energetic storyline whereas this 2002 hit carries a feeling of drama with the line of characters and their lives in the new world.Whereas there are lapses and the end feels rushed 28 days is exciting and penetrates the mind with some unbelievable direction and location with the writing on top form.",28 Days Later...

I hate to give UK movies a bad press but as anyone can see this film should have ended at 45 minutes and cut their losses while it was still interesting.

126,DarthBill,No relation to the Sandra Bullock movie,8,11 August 2004,"One of those damned pesky incurable virus', playfully nicknamed ""rage"", starts running rampant through the world, turning people into mindless, blood thirsty animals. Our quote unquote ""hero"" Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital and wanders around looking for help and eventually runs into the mannish Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley). Mark is later killed when he is suspected of being infected and later Jim and Selena run into a lovable family man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Together they make a trek to find some army guys who might help them, but Frank is gunned down after he becomes infected and later on we find out that most of the soldiers are horny bastards, which puts them and their leader Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) at odds with Jim. Well, Jim eventually uses his wits to overcome the evil soldiers and escapes with Selena and Hannah, and they eventually get rescued or at least alluded to getting rescued.It could be argued that this really isn't a zombie film, seeing as how zombies are resurrected corpses and these are once living people who have been turned into killers thanks to the virus. It's pretty fun to watch overall, with lots of dark atmosphere and a moody score, though it runs out of a steam a little bit towards the end. In terms of actual acting, well, the truth is that cold fish Cillian Murphy and the rest of the cast are all easily out-shined and out-acted by Brendan Gleeson as the teddy bearish father Frank. I'm sorry but Brendan Gleeson brought a warmth and humanity to the film that made it a lot more compelling when he was on the screen.

127,jluis1984,Horror movies the way they used to be...,9,21 June 2006,"When most people think of horror movies they immediately think of pointless nudity, gallons of blood and tons of gore; and while that image may be close to reality, the horror genre offers the chance of delivering something else, something intelligent, something deep. Of course, not every director/writer takes that chance, but when they do, it is big. Director Danny Boyle adds a bit of blood to his effective formula of existentialist character studies in ""28 Days Later..."", a powerful ans smart apocalyptic horror movie in the old style of ""Last Man on Earth"" or Romero's ""Dead"" trilogy.One morning a young British man named Jim awakes from a coma and finds nobody around. He doesn't know it but 28 days before a lethal virus codenamed ""Rage"" was unleashed by accident leading to thousands of deaths and the evacuation of London and other major cities. Now Jim, along with a handful of other survivors must find a safe place and a way to find other survivors of the epidemic before being killed by the hundreds of still living infected people.""28 Days Later..."" is a horror film the way the genre used to be, it is not only an entertaining and scary movie, it is a through-provoking one. Written by Alex Garland, the film offers a surprisingly realist and very insightful take on humanity and survival, as well as providing an interesting social commentary on the easy corruption of the authority. Sure, it may not be the most original movie in the world, but the execution of the whole idea is near perfect. Director Danny Boyle builds up his story at the right pace and lets the story unfold smoothly.The realistic visuals used in the film gives the movie a semi-documentary look that gives the film a frightening realism. As usual, Boyle's focus is in the characters rather than in the plot and this approach is just what makes this horror movie so different than other examples of modern horror. He makes us know, like and eventually care for this characters in a very reminiscent way to what George Romero did in ""Night of the Living Dead"" and its sequels. This is no coincidence as Danny Boyle doesn't hide his influences; the film pays true tribute to well-known classics of the genre without being derivative or pretentious.Cillian Murphy is simply superb as the lead character, but credit must also go to Naomi Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns, who play the other survivors Jim finds. Naomie Harris gives a terrific performance as a woman who will do whatever is necessary to survive, and Gleeson and Burns are very effective and their father-daughter relationship is very believable. Murphy has earned praise for his performance but it is safe to say that without this good supporting cast the movie wouldn't be the same.If a flaw was to be found in ""28 Days Later..."" it would be that probably the film may not everyone's cup of tea. Fans of horror will be really pleased but the casual movie goer may be turned off by the grim depressing tone of the film and its ruthless violence. Other than that the film is near perfect and while not the most original horror film, it is one of the best executed examples of the so-called ""zombie sub-genre"".With its well-rounded characters, its witty plot and its remarkable visual style, this modern horror film proves that it deserves all the hype surrounding it. While only time will prove if the film becomes a classic or not, it is definitely one of the best horror movies of the decade. 9/10",28 Days Later...
128,gregsrants,Eerie!,7,5 February 2004,"Imagine this.  You wake up in a hospital after an accident and no one is around.  No people, no nurses, no one.  You pull the tubes from your forearms and pay little attention to the room's door which has been barricaded.  You stumble into the hospital lobby, and again, no people.  You walk out onto the usual busy streets of the metropolis and there is a deafening quietness.  You see cars abandoned on the road and money is flying through the air like pollen on a windy day.  Again, no people.  You walk into a church and see piles of bodies piled one on top of each other rotting in a disgusting stench.  You see everything, but signs of life. Imagine.28 Days Later's protagonist Jim (Cillian Murphy) finds himself in this very position after waking up from a car accident only to find that a virus spread by monkey's infected with rage' has overcome the city.Crafted by Trainspotting director Danny Boyle on a budget of only $8 million dollars, 28 Days Later became 2003's Blair Witch Project wherein word of mouth spread quickly that this was the' scary movie to see this summer, and audiences spilled out $10 million on opening week-end on-way to an impressive $45 million haul.The film itself is not entirely original.  A virus spreads making zombie like creatures out of anyone who is contaminated with their blood, and a group of non-infected individuals fight with mighty arsenals to defeat the ravaging brood.  Scary, huh.The story follows Jim as he tries to adapt to his new environment and look for additional signs of controlled life and hope.  Along the way, Jim buddies up with a female survivor and later with a father and his young daughter who are safely protected in a high rise apartment building.  After hearing a broadcast over a transistor radio, the group goes out in search for others, fighting zombies and the disease at every stop.It is when they reach the army base that the movie begins to slip a little into familiar and unfortunate genre clichés.  Although heavily armed and secure in their location, the new family unit begins to fight amongst themselves and soon they are addressing their animal desires for sex and dominance.   It's hard to believe that when they are all that is left in the world they would sacrifice some for the pleasure of others. 
But let's give credit where it is due.  Although lacking in premise originality, the film is generally entertaining due largely in part to the eeriness of the films backdrop of roads and cities completely vacant of any moving person or object.  And where as most zombie films seem to have creatures crawling out of their graves, 28 Days Later gives us a realistic story as to how the disease originated and how it could spread so quickly.I guess what ultimately makes 28 Days Later so scary is how believable the notion of a disease wiping out all of humanity could occur.  Look no further than Mad Cow Disease, AIDS or SARS in the last couple of years and you wonder how close to this reality we might actually be.  Scary indeed.",28 Days Later...
129,cchase,Not Your Average 'Zombie' Flick...,9,4 December 2008,"Danny Boyle is a true gem: a director who gives you no idea what he's going to come up with next. Crossing over with an eerie ease from Hitchcockian thriller (SHALLOW GRAVE) to a funny, gritty, nauseatingly disturbing drama about addiction (TRAINSPOTTING), when I heard that he might be doing a 'horror' film, I couldn't wait to see the result. Actually, with the exception of the startling trailer for the movie, which gave surprisingly little away, I thought I was all ready to tackle Boyle's version of zombie culture.As it turns out, I wasn't.I don't remember the last time I gasped and cringed that much at a movie, much less jumped out of my seat, (which I did several times - something that happens VERY rarely these days.) Much in the way that he less channeled Hitchcock in SHALLOW GRAVE than redefined that director's paradigm of what a suspense thriller is, 28 DAYS LATER doesn't really ape the work of George Romero or Lucio Fulci. Rather it re-energizes the genre by giving us something that, technically speaking, really isn't a ""zombie"" film more than it is a 'plague' movie. Relocate Stephen King's THE STAND in present-day London, and re-populate it with British characters and you're almost close to the feel of what it is.Written by Alex Garland (author of Boyle's ambitiously flawed THE BEACH), LATER'S opening takes its cues from both the Romero and Roger Corman playbooks. Three wrongheaded militant animal activists break into a science lab with the intention of freeing the animals there from the barbarity of medical experimentation. What they don't realize is that they're not only too late, but they are about to loose something upon the world that was never meant to get out...And then, 28 DAYS LATER -A young patient in hospital named Jim (Cillian Murphy in his first major role) awakens in his hospital bed to find himself alone. Not just in his room, but in the hospital, in the surrounding neighborhood, in the city...maybe even in the country. THE WORLD, perhaps. You are as disoriented, startled and scared as he is, and concerned FOR him as Boyle allows you to practically walk in his shoes for a bit and wonder what you would do in his place.Jim goes looking for other people. And he does find them, as they also find him. But the first ones he sees moving about aren't really people anymore...To say more is to spoil the industrial-strength effect this movie will have on your nerves if you haven't seen it before. All you need to know is that there are two kinds of people in this terrifying new world: the infected and the uninfected. And the line between the two groups is as fragile as a drop of blood...It adds to the sense of heightened realism that the cast (much like famed horror classics like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD) is comprised almost entirely of unknown actors. Murphy was only a few years away from RED EYE and BATMAN BEGINS, and Naomie Harris's breakout role in the ""PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN"" sequel was still in the not-too-distant future. Only HARRY POTTER'S Brendan Gleason is sort of recognizable, and robust as ever as a survivor trying to protect his daughter from the ravages of what has become Hell on Earth.Zombie film or not, whatever you want to classify it as, 28 DAYS LATER is definitely not for the squeamish. Fast, frightening and ferocious, there are scenes of brutality that are not gratuitous by any means, but they're strategically placed at parts of the story when you will least expect them, and they have all the more impact as you come to learn about Jim and his new ""friends"", and you start to give a damn about what happens to them.True, as noted in other reviews, the movie does start to lose steam around the middle of Act Three, and the controversial ending may leave some of you feeling unsatisfied. (Don't forget to review the alternative endings on the comprehensive DVD.)But this is still worth more than just a passing glance. It might very well qualify as a present- day classic. And though Boyle has drifted away from horror again for the moment, I can't wait to see what he cooks up when he returns to it...",28 Days Later...

This film, without putting it mildly, is mostly stunning. All of the characters are well explained and well performed & the plot itself is excellent. In fact, the only flaw with this film is it's ending which is (to say the least) a bit pathetic, but this seems to be an on running problem with all films nowadays which seem incapable of actually properly ending the masterpieces they are up until whatever point. Anyway, irrelevant of this one technical flaw, for the first 9/10ths of this film, it is expertly written & performed.""28 Days Later"" begins at an Animal Testing facility where a couple of Animal Rights Protesters attempt to release some infected animals into nature. They unfortunately succeed and thus doom the entire of Britain to become full of ""infected"", people who are blood hungry and madder than Britain's Foreign Policies. This film then skips to 28 days later where a man (Jim) awakens in a hospital after being put into a coma two or three days previously to the original outbreak. The film then progresses as Jim searches for survivors and answers & then attempts to escape this country which is now under quarantine.Jim and his friends gain and loose members until an explosive climax. Now if you haven't seen this film, I recommend stopping reading now as going to briefly mention later parts of the film & discuss things which could ruin this wonderful experience.Everyone who doesn't want to read ahead gone? Good.Eventually Jim and his few remaining friends encounter the remnants of an Army compound & eventually these Army men abuse their abilities in an attempt to rape particular women & Jim is forced to fight back. This fight back is powerful (helped by a stunning soundtrack) and when Jim eventually is faced to face with his remaining friend Selena, it is the obvious culmination of the idea that despite the ""rage"" being an investment of physical violence, simultaneously it is possible for us to be just as crazy and animalistic when we are angry. Perhaps this is one notion the film intentionally tries to show us. This film shows us just how aggressive and exploitative we can be when a social morality ceases to exist and we are quite literally living like animals.I could go off on one now about the whole notion of the flaws with Animal Activision, but I'm going to pass on this opportunity and summarise.In general, for the vast majority of this film, the plot, acting, and minimal special effects work wonderfully together (Jim walking through abandoned London is particularly effective. Always wanted to see a Big Red Bus on it's side), but ultimately the ending is a disappointing dip down. Either way, it is unfair to condemn the majority of this film for it's ending.

There are many terrific frightening moments and despite many limitations during production (budget, permits to shoot in places, etc...) the film is a solid fright-fest.

132,FilmOtaku,A Zombie Movie... With A Brain!,8,29 June 2003,"There was so much hype about how scary this film was that I had reservations about seeing it, being the fraidy cat that I am.  However, my much younger sister begged me to take her, and I ended up thanking her for it afterward.I should have known that I would like 28 Days Later from the start.  It was directed by Danny Boyle, who has provided us with the great Trainspotting and Shallow Grave among other films.  All of his films have a great frenetic style to them, and 28 Days follows in that tradition.  Shot with digital film, this medium provided a grittiness and realism that could have been too slick if it had been filmed on traditional celluloid.  This is pure speculation, but regardless, the digital format added an almost documentarian feel to the film.  In addition to the fact that the main character, Jim has been hospitalized for a month after an accident and wakes up to find London virtually deserted, he has some zombies that have been infected with a virus called RAGE to contend with.  These are not your late sixties Romero zombies that walked around slowly and moaned for brains - these are new and improved zombies who move at mind numbing speed, vomit blood constantly, and aren't necessarily concerned with turning you into one of them - they don't mind killing you, quickly and painfully.  But don't go into this movie expecting a simple slasher/horror flick. Unlike many horror films of the last forty years, 28 Days doesn't rely on a thin (if at all existent) storyline, teen hotties, and corny humor to supplement its non-action oriented sequences.  This is a film that explores family, utopia and most notably, survival among other themes.  Having said that, it is not the least bit preachy or pretentious, and certainly does not take itself too seriously.  What 28 Days does provide is two hours of disturbing yet compelling imagery, an intelligent voice that will have you deconstructing the plot for hours, even days after you see it, and of course, fantastic zombies. If you don't want to see a horror/suspense film that transcends the plot devices of Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street films, don't bother with this one.  But if you are looking for something with a little more mettle, definitely check this one out - even my sister, a die hard slasher flick fan loved it. --Shelly",28 Days Later...

Cillian Murphy is the hapless hero, compelled to join forces with a motley band of survivors (including Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Noah Huntley) who run afoul of an Army encampment run by well-meaning - but deluded - military officer Christopher Eccleston, whose rash behavior unleashes a fresh wave of horror. Comparisons with the work of George A. Romero are inevitable, though the film's impact is blunted by rapid editing which curtails the violence and renders some of the action scenes incomprehensible in places. However, Boyle uses edgy visuals to keep the audience off-guard at all times, and the narrative builds to a satisfying conclusion. The opening sequence, in which Murphy stumbles through deserted London streets, is truly haunting.",28 Days Later...
134,tonypeacock-1,Zombie horror brought back to the mainstream in a non-comedic way,8,18 May 2019,"2002 film, directed by Danny Boyle of Trainspotting fame. This film brings zombie horror back to the mainstream. Not in a comedic way like Shaun Of The Dead but showing a bleak British Isles post infection with a rage blood borne infection that has wiped out most of the 60 million or so population within 28 days of it escaping a laboratory at the beginning of the film, hence the title.If you have ever seen the television film, Threads where a post nuclear apocalypse occurs in Cold War Britain this film is similar.There are a few scattered people that are not infected, struggling to survive like scavenges. The only caveat to their mundane life being able to raid supermarket shelves like the gameshow Supermarket Sweep and loot the most expensive bottled whisky!The film cleverly shows deserted London landmarks such as Westminster Bridge and Piccadilly Circus. The streets in a quiet,(unknown in bustling London) deserted state. Quickly filmed in cleared streets in the pre morning rush hour in when dawn is early.Boyle uses digital cameras to aid the quick setting up of such scenes in a wsy that traditional 35mm cameras wouldn't allow. The digital photography isn't quite as clear as traditional film and adds to the bleakness of the environment.Danny Boyle is adding quite a filmography. The aforementioned Trainspotting and its sequel. 127 Hours, Slumdog Millionaire. All good films.",28 Days Later...

It is a very good original idea and the acting and direction is done well I just feel it slowed down a bunch and never picked up again after the beginning.This movie is about a man who wakes up in a hospital only to find out he is all alone. He wanders onto the street where he discovers that a strange disease has wiped out everybody.This movie was not all bad but I think it lost it near the end. The movie started off really strong then kind of got boring in my opinion. The sequel is better.,28 Days Later...

137,oneloveall,One of Horror's most artistically ambitious films struggles to resolve itself,7,8 May 2007,"The thinking man's zombie flick 28 Days Later, at it's best a frighteningly stylish British apocalypse, though at it's worst a technically overwrought stew of disjointed action and theme, nevertheless accomplishes elevating the horror genre to inspired new levels. With a strong first half, director Danny Boyle capitalizes on being an outsider to the zombie genre, shown by his evocative capturing of England through the eyes of one just waking up to this future-less nightmare(Cillian Murphy). Boyle takes this tried and true end-of-the-world scenario and instills a new artistic integrity into the carnage. Capturing the British landscape in such a desolate manner paid off in making this film something far more memorable then any plot specifics could. The eerie, vast stillness that serves as the film's superior first act will eventually become sidetracked by a confused, action-intensive finale, but during this awkward transition Boyle does not forget to maintain a psychological edge to parallel the progressive decay.Essentially split in two distinct movements, the action-packed showdown does not live up to the first half's sensually broadcast set design. Boyle and writing partner Alex Garland are to be commended for turning a horror found inside these enraged zombies unto ourselves for analysis, but in their overwrought hyper-kinetic style and morality logistics, manage to make the overall experience feel duller then the gorgeous setup would suggest.Whatever setbacks the cluttered second half demonstrate, it still only robs a uniquely great scary movie from being brilliant. How Boyle technically captures the infected (sped-up and annoyingly visceral) becomes more distracting then helpful, which a devolved but thematically viable climax attests to, but with the last lingering frame of haunting ambiguity, one remains in awe of this elevated fright-fest. Certainly one of the few zombie-type films that will ever grace a certain demographic's appreciation, and in that alone an instant triumph for Danny Boyle which continues to prove his adept range as a filmmaker.",28 Days Later...

140,TheOtherFool,Horror with a twist,6,19 October 2004,"Somehow, the feel of 28 days later exceeds most horror/zombie/infection movies. If such movies have flooded the box-office these last couple of years, 28 days later is, well, 'something else'.An infected monkey is freed by activists, not knowing this infection will soon spread among humans. And indeed, 28 days later, the majority of the English are infected zombie-like creatures. But somehow they past by Jim, who has been in the hospital these couple of weeks after an accident. When he wakes up, there's just empty hallways, empty streets... until he gets attacked by our growling zombies. He is then rescued by Selena and the two of them meet up with a dad and daughter, and the four of them try to make it to a, what they think, safe place.Then the movie turns more psychological, and I must say it's losing a bit of the grip it had me in during the first 45 minutes or so. Although it's still better than a lot of comparable movies in this genre, I was feeling the movie kinda ran out of steam.Danny Boyle tried something new, and it worked out for at least some parts, although ultimately (and not helped with the ending), I was expecting just a little bit more.6/10.PS Fantastic music by Godspeed You Black Emperor in the beginning with Jim wandering the streets.",28 Days Later...
141,RJBurke1942,You want horror? You got it here. This is a horror of a movie,3,21 May 2007,"Is there anything substantially good to say about his movie? Well, the cinematography is good, as is the editing; and the special effects are reasonably well done. The empty streets of London are suitably eerie in the first twenty minutes or so.Beyond that, however, this narrative a nothing more than The Day of The Triffids (1962) redux and only passably better than that earlier horror of a film.Here's the story, in case you don't know about the Triffids story: sometime in the future, horrible virus kills/sends insane almost all people in the world; young man wakes up in hospital, escapes London with two females, fighting mad zombies all the way; finally reaches sanctuary in rural mansion where British soldiers maintain a last stand; situation with soldiers deteriorates because they want the women for sex and survival of humanity; young man and women finally break out from internecine strife that kills all the soldiers in gory glory; young man and women then flee north and are finally found by 'good' authorities (we think...).Along all that way, there are more than enough opportunities for the special effects people to show you just how many ways a body can be gutted, maimed, hacked to pieces, tortured, smashed, bashed, garroted, and riddled with bullets. So, if that's your thing, then this one's for you.Okay, so the subtext is a metaphor for H5N1 (bird flu)  or some other virus -- that's now lurking in the background, all around the world, and probably mutating, as I write, to allow transmission from human to human... Movies such as this one, however, don't help to educate anybody about anything except fear.Oh, sorry, this film is just entertainment, is it?I first caught this movie on late night TV and sat down to watch what I thought might be an interesting horror flick; after fifteen minutes or so, I was so bored I switched it off. Then, months later, I read a review of 28 Weeks Later (due out soon) and was intrigued sufficiently to get 28 Days Later to have a second look. I'm now sorry I did, because it truly is a waste of time to watch. And from what I've read about the sequel, that's worse.So, see it if you must, but don't let your kiddies know.",28 Days Later...

This is a genre of films I do not like much, especially with vampires and zombies in this case. I did not like From Dusk till dawn, and many other horror/thriller favorites. However Danny Boyles 28 Days Later is great, if it wasn't for an ending which was a bit mediocre, this film would have been perfect. It starts out so well, and has great acting/direction throughout. I thought the script was a bit flawed because the third act didn't always make sense and was a bit bizarre and mediocre. This film was still good though, i liked it, a great use of music in this film, Boyle impressed me.

143,gigan-92,Pinnacle of Horror,10,4 July 2011,"Director Danny Boyle's creation is one of true genius. He's done what so few horror films have ever done, cementing the characters in the audience's hearts. The movie is not so much a zombie-flick but more of a drama infused with horror while telling a tale of the all-too real fall of man. Cillian Murphy was awesome, along with Naomie Harris and really the whole small cast is just overwhelmingly great. The characters are built up enough to feel a cringe in your heart when their in peril, and yes, this film will nauseate you with it's not just its gore but its horrifying look at humanity. It's not only a survival story, but one that questions mankind's place in this world.Not to mention John Murphy's score is absolutely stunning. It literally gives one chills, encompassing fear, pain and over all savagery. The film's moments of silence are even more unrelenting in their magnificence and quiet terror. It really stands out as a different type of horror that some main stream audiences may not like because it actually has plot, which is turn off to most popcorn movie goers.

144,roedyg,"If you like projectile blood vomiting, and rape",4,1 November 2005,"I got this movie to watch on Halloween because it was reputedly a very scary movie. I don't think I felt frightened even once in the entire movie. There is no aching suspense, no sudden jumping out.The lead actor Cillian Murphy is almost impossibly handsome. The camera often takes time out from the mountains of gore to lovingly caress his face and body which sometimes seems so jarringly immaculate it looks as if he just walked off a fashion runway.There is lots of slime and blood and festering, hours of it. There is also what felt like like 10 hours of footage of people bashing each others' brains out in the dark. I could not tell who was bashing who or why.I have never watched a movie where I had less sympathy for any of the characters. Even the ""heroes"" were totally selfish opportunists.The rape scenes were supposed to be terrifying, but I could not help but laugh. Why would anyone give a thought to rape when they knew they were about be pounced on at any second by rabid plague victims? The mayhem wore thin very quickly. The villains were as distinctive as the white plastic-coated soldiers in Star Wars.By far the most interesting parts of the movie were about the gritty practicalities of living without electricity, running water, grocery stores or other people.As metaphor, the movie had its moments. It showed how money really is just a token in a social game. Money becomes meaningless in the apocalyptic world. There was one bit of philosophising when a soldier noted that for most of earth's history it had no people, and now with this megaplague, earth was returning to normal. The plague itself is symbolic of the rage that spreads from person to person in modern urban society, erupting in mass violence like the Iraq war.The special effects went on for what seemed like an eternity too, namely wandering through British cities without seeing a even a single car or pedestrian. I suppose these might be more interesting to people familiar with the landmarks with their normal bustle. The effect was supposed to be eerie, but for me, it came across much like visiting a resort town out of tourist season. It has been done too many times before and director Danny Boyle belaboured it. He went on for what felt like hours of it with nothing happening.P.S. I was not on drugs. The time dilation effect comes purely through repetition of the exact same thing over and over and over.",28 Days Later...

146,movieguy1021,28 Days Later: 7/10,7,4 July 2003,"Not since the classic Night of the Living Dead have we seen a good, creepy zombie movie. And it looks like it will be awhile more. Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later is barely scary, but if you take it for what it really is, a creative drama, it's pretty good. However, instead of the position of Venus, animal rights activists release contaminated apes to the world, which are infected with rage. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from a coma and finds London completely deserted. He sees some attacking zombies, but Mark (Noah Huntley) and Selena (Naomie Harris) ward them off. Soon he goes along with them to try to find other survivors, but to also try and find a cure.Although there have been attempts, the last good horror film was Identity. 28 Days Later tries to be a horror film by putting in a few quick and semi-suspenseful scenes. All before the final, concluding sequence (which is the film's greatest sequence), are quick, five-second shots of zombies trying to attack people. Boyle has the camera moving so quickly during those sequences it's impossible to tell what's happening. Of course, we could see all of the blood, because there's plenty of it, but at times it looked real, but many times it was false.28 Days Later, which I originally thought was a sequel to the Sandra Bullock romantic comedy 28 Days, really makes itself a good movie by putting in a scenario we've all thought about but never really see in movies. The end of the world is always an interesting subject: when will it happen, how will it occur, etc. This explores one way: an infectious virus. It probably would have played better if we didn't know how London was empty, but the way writer Alex Garland made it work, also.In between those scarce horror sequences, some good drama plays out. We learn more about the virus, but I thought that the relationship between Jim and Selena was very well done. Movies like this have a limited amount of characters, making us like the ones that are there. I wouldn't call it a character-driven piece, nor a character study, but it certainly has interesting characters.If you're looking for a typical zombie-horror movie, look somewhere else. If you want a drama with intense scenes (and an AWESOME score), check out 28 Days Later.My rating: 7/10Rated R for strong violence and gore, language, and nudity.",28 Days Later...
147,ThurstonHunger,Allegory versus Gory,7,1 February 2004,"*SPOILERS*For those disappointed that this is not a ""zombie film,"" well I guess we all want to see ourselves on the silver screen.No, no, no...but ""28 Days Later"" delivered enough for me. I've not seen the ""Triffid"" film others spoke of, but certainly ""Lifeforce"" and John Carpenter's remake of ""The Thing"" (my idea of a horror masterpiece) were called to mind.I suspect the blankness of the main character at the start of film, is one way to make it easier for a viewer to identify with him or her. Silence can speak volumes...and win Academy Awards for females. :(Anyway, images of an abandoned metropolis are always fascinating to me. I didn't quite connect with the espirit du corps of our ragtag heroes (editing *out* the taxi cab vaudeville was a good idea). More backstory on the daughter/dad pair might have helped?In other extra's we are ""treated"" to three alternative endings, I think that speaks to two things. First it speaks to the power of editing (although one of those endings is presented somewhat spellbindingly with just storyboard and the director and writer reading). Secondly it speaks to a vision of the story here that is not so strong.Here, the main thread of the film sticks to a ""you gotta have hope when skies are grey...and eyes are blood red"" theme. This gets sealed by a kiss or two. Pretty safe.The kissers both undergo transformations that come across as a bit abrupt. Jim escapes execution to come back nearly as rabid as a RAGEr. That sort of makes sense, in a ""you-or-me"" assault, and he did have a baptism of blood in a really wrong pitstop along the way. That was a classic, ""don't go in there...please don't go in there""...moment for me. Too many of those can kill a film, hamburgers or no.Meanwhile Selena's move to de facto motherhood from every-woman-for-herself seemed even more out of place.All that happens at the outpost at the edge of Manchester's burning. Those scenes, while the most flawed, are the most interesting. What must happen for us to lose our humanity...is a question posed. That answer is not just being infected by some sinister virus.What is the ""nature"" of man, of the world? Are bloodlust and lust such strange bedfellows? That was tempered by a very leit motif of Adam and Eve chapter two!Also would the world cut off its England to save its commonwealths? Would we vote the whole island off during this game of Survivor?Some assail this as it tries to be an ""intelligent"" film, and hey at least it tries. Ultimately the panic of the day doesn't allow for much time to philosophize...the frenetic nature of attacks is well underscored by expensive digital dithering and a far more simple sound effect.  Woooosh.Again I bought the premise of the demise of civilization, and felt tense throughout without being too easily manipulated. I'll always prefer a film that opts for allegory over the merely gory.I think one key to these thought-thrillers might be keeping a smaller scope for the story. In the aforementioned ""The Thing"" we get snowed in isolation. ""The Cube"" exists in its own vaccum... Maybe that's a key...work in the cozy confines of a microcosm??All told, style, soundtrack, odd bits (Jim shaving himself) I recommend seeing this with a7/10and suggest folks who enjoy the film read Jose Saramago's ""Blindness""Sorry this has been an even more diffuse review than normal, but one more observation. The opening with the ape strapped in front of the multiple television screens showing atrocities, is this the horror film calling the world horrific?Do images of violence beget violence? That would be quite a controversial stance for a film. That scene with the banks of television stood out from the sort of promethean warning of lab science leading us astray in the opening.",28 Days Later...
148,WriterDave,Brilliantly Conceived Zombie Holocaust Flick,8,30 June 2003,"People......people who eat people.....are the luckiest people.....So what would happen if they crossed ""Night of the Living Dead"" with ""Twelve Monkeys"" and ""The Pianist"" (yes! ""The Pianist!"")? Well, here's your answer, and as you might expect, it ain't for everyone. Still, it's pretty f***ing brilliant no matter which way you cut it. The nifty little thing about Boyle, is that he really didn't make a zombie film. He's made a casualties of war survival film. Sure there's plenty of zombie gore to please the hardcore genre fans, and it comes early and in the bucket-loads. Also, to the film's advantage, all the gore is the old fashioned kind, i.e. there ain't no CGI here, folks (something that really hampered a film like ""Resident Evil"").But real film fans will enjoy the emotional complexity, surprisingly engaging character development (which is way deeper than any horror film has the right to be) and the shocking ""survival at any costs"" theme that undercuts the entire film. You'll be hard pressed to find a horror movie with more endearing or ""real"" characters. Another refreshing aspect is that all of the humor (something every good horror movie needs in moderate doses) arises from realistic interactions amongst the characters. Nothing here is an ""in joke"" or overtly self-aware (like ""Scream"" and all its knockoffs). The film takes itself pretty seriously, and has some serious things to say about human nature and survival. When it gets down to it, how far would you go to survive? To protect your loved ones? To find hope? You had no right to expect a horror flick to be this deep or emotionally devastating....until now. Will horror films ever be the same? It's hard to tell so soon, and especially since the apocalyptic zombie stuff is so derivative (that will make it easy for detractors to dismiss the film). And while the herky-jerky digital camera work is used effectively here, it's another trend that most find annoying in films, and that could hurt how folks regard this movie in the future. I think it's got the long clean lines of a classic...but only time will tell...and as long as the zombies don't get us first.",28 Days Later...

150,LoneWolfAndCub,Boyle re-invents the zombie genre!,9,16 November 2007,"Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, The Beach, Shallow Grave) is an amazing and visionary director. You may ask, what separates 28 Days Later from any other zombie film, isn't it just about a group of survivors trying to escape the hordes of infected? One thing, this doesn't focus on blood and gore, flashy MTV style editing and heavy metal music to scare the audience. 28 Days Later focuses more on the eerie, emotional and unsettling to involve the audience.A group of animal activists accidentally release an incurable virus into England. This virus causes the infected to be filled with rage and become hungry for blood. Four weeks later and England is virtually empty, their are handfuls of survivors around the place. Four survivors team up and try to find sanctuary while fending off hordes of the infected.Aside from the amazing acting (especially by Cillian Murphy), the awesome camera-work and beautiful cinematography this movie has some great messages (much like Romero's zombie movies). Although this movie is about a rage virus, rage is a human emotion and this is evident towards the end when our protagonist goes a rampage, killing everyone in sight. He isn't infected, however, and what tops this perfect scene off is one of the other survivors mistakes him for one of the infected (but doesn't kill him).Our society is plagued by violence and rage and Danny Boyle is the perfect man to show us this using cinema. 28 Days Later is an amazing and terrifying horror movie and I highly recommend it to everyone.4½/5",28 Days Later...

152,christophe92300,Almost felt like two different movies,6,26 February 2013,"28 Days Later is clearly composed of two distinctive parts. The first part deals, in a very dynamic and effective way, of the survival itself after the catastrophe, and one gets easily carried away by the journey of the group. Then, as soon as they get to the military ""base"", the scenario takes a turn, the rhythm, the tension drop, and the atmosphere of the movie shifts completely, not necessarily in a good way, with this storyline of a chaotic society capable of the worst atrocities.While the first part seems rather better than the second, the brutal transition between the two is what stands out, so much that it seems like two different movies. The outcome also turns out to be a bit abrupt and would have deserved a lit more thinking and a better integration with the rest of the plot. It is a shame because there certainly was a more subtle way of associating these elements to create a more logical, fluid and homogeneous movie.Finally, it should be noted that this feature was shot using DV cameras (except for the last few minutes at the cottage) which explains the roughness of the image and its lack of detail.",28 Days Later...

Romero zombie flicks from Night of the Living Dead (1968) to Dawn of the Dead (1978), Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later..."" is a bloody nightmare of a film and one hell of a ride that I've had the pleasure of experiencing. It's different than most zombie movies because this time around, somebody placed adrenaline on these creatures to make them more scary than before.The film begins after a protest outside of London, England where a bunch of PETA freaks decide to let loose a bunch of caged experiment chimps where they don't know what they've been infected with until one of them catches the disease where all hell starts to begin.28 Days Later after the incident, there's not a single soul walking around the streets or bridges of London. No cars honking or crashing except a lone survivor by the name of Jim (Cillian Murphy in a leading heroic role) gets out of bed to see that he is the only man left on the face of England until he realizes that the apocalypse begins and there are other survivors including Selena (Naomie Harris) and her male friend, Mark (Noah Huntly), they try to see if they could find any weapons they could use to hunt the human creatures down.The way the zombies attack in this film is much more different than having the flesh bitten off, the blood of a zombie has to hit the eye or the inside of your mouth where within a couple of seconds, that person becomes a zombie and has to be killed.After Mark is attacked by zombies and killed by Selena, her and Jim run through the streets of London where they meet up with Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter. The four of them embark on a journey where it plays like Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" with the characters making London their own personal ground stealing stuff before being chased by zombies and fighting off soldiers in a hideaway mansion.""28 Days Later"" is truly a virtuoso in horror cinema where in this decade, Danny Boyle must've taken notes to find out how to make a successful horror picture.It sure as hell worked for me.",28 Days Later...

Also, settings, London is my favorite one.So, overall a masterpiece of zombie's genre, and great job from Danny Boyle.",28 Days Later...
156,harryplinkett14,Senseless,1,26 July 2018,"I guess the only appeal of this film is that it has a distinct nihilist flavour, delighting in the annihilation of everything. Maybe what a lot of people understand intuitively - that our civilization is terminally ill, is what makes us enjoy some of the scenes in which all the filth seems to have been swept away, so we can start anew. 
Still, the film repeats all the cliches from the zombie genre, and has few original moments. What was somewhat original was that the zombies were fast and agile. But the characters are dull, their actions are absurd most of the time, and the climax is illogical and forced. I felt really let down when it was over. One more thing: zombie or not, no one can run like crazy for days and weeks without a break. Especially since the film makes a point that the infection is biological and not supernatural. Running zombies would have passed out and died much sooner than the film imagines.",28 Days Later...

158,ebeckstr-1,Overrated and problematic,5,14 November 2020,"This is the only review I've ever written that contains spoilers, but there are so many reviews of this film that want to raise it to the level of greatness that the only way to properly assess it is by talking about some plot elements, so be forewarned, some spoilers ahead.I understand that I'm in the minority here and that everyone seems to think this is a great movie, a classic, and so on. One of the most disappointing things about 28 Days Later is that there are really excellent moments woven throughout the first two thirds of the movie, before it completely falls apart. One of these excellent moments is a sequence of true cinematic beauty, enfolded within one of Brian Eno's most beautiful soundscapes, originally created for the documentary For All Mankind, about Apollo's mission to the Moon. I'm including this specific example because it underscores the level of thought and sincerity behind the movie, which makes its failure all the more dismaying.The problem is, the movie devolves in the last third into a disappointing failure of theme, story, and character by undermining much of what it has worked so hard to do in the first part of the movie. Apparently the director and the screenwriter felt that the two strong, smart, female protagonists needed to be taken down a couple of notches through captivity by a group of men, the threat of rape looming front and center for a half hour, and the necessity of being rescued by yet another man, and then rescued yet again by other men. There is also a sickening, racist plot development which involves a black man held with a chattel chain around his neck. He's being experimented on, just as African-American men were experimented on with untreated syphilis in the 1930s through the 1970s in the Tuskegee Study, in the US.I have a feeling the movie was trying to make a statement, perhaps trying to be critical of authoritarian, patriarchal, misogynistic militarism and racism - the worst things so-called civilization has to offer. But it is ultimately so unsubtle in its approach that this content comes off as exactly the opposite.I realize that most people are going to give this review an Unhelpful rating, that most will believe I'm overthinking it, people just want to watch a good horror movie, etc. But everything I'm saying is the case. This is a movie that possesses moments of succes, but that's not enough to rescue it from its own ideologically misguided trajectory and conclusion, which is a straight-faced, completely unironic reestablishment of the traditional nuclear family, patriarchy, and even the protective militarism which five minutes earlier had been threatening literal rape. The movie makes no sense internally, and offers a smartly packaged, dysfunctional, downright offensive conventionality; all of this while most reviews tout the film's unconventionality and originality.",28 Days Later...
159,PeachHamBeach,Not the scariest movie since THE EXORCIST...,8,16 August 2010,"...not even close. The only time I even flinched was when Jim set off the car alarm by accident! Still, 28 DAYS LATER is a very enjoyable horror movie. I don't know why they call it a ""zombie"" movie. There were no zombies. They weren't ""undead""! The ""monsters"" depicted are people infected with a virus. A nasty one indeed, with rage and blood-red eyes and other yucky symptoms. The playfully twisted personality of Danny Boyle is what really makes this horror film (not my favorite genre of course) work for me. I loved TRAINSPOTTING and SHALLOW GRAVE, and this film has those bits of dark humor throughout. Loved the grocery shopping scenes and the soundtrack.The strong cast is another reason I enjoyed it. Each actor had a role for the viewer. I love Cillian Murphy (the soul whose confusion, fear and later, strength and resolve we all experience from the start of the film),Brendan Gleeson (the heart! more on that below) and Christopher Eccleston (the brain that ends up losing ability to reason), and I really enjoyed Naomie Harris (the brawn, relentlessly brutal when she's wielding that huge knife), who I hadn't seen before this film. The characters of a film to me are very important, and these characters, all their interactions and experiences, the family dynamic (Gleeson, in particular gives a beautiful performance as the father figure to the little cluster of survivors), make this one several cuts above the standard crappy horrors that are coming forth these days.Took me a while to warm up to it, but it is actually quite the classic.",28 Days Later...
160,hellholehorror,"Thoughtful, provoking and clever",10,7 October 2017,"Danny Boyle at his best. A great story well told with plenty of violence and great movie imagery. One of my favourite films ever with one of the most enticing trailers that I have ever seen. It is essentially a zombie film but there is so much more intelligence compared to your average gore infested zombie flick. This is thoughtful, provoking, clever and overall an amazing film throughout. Only minor criticisms come from the occasionally scrappy looking digital film used and some niggling continuity errors. Very minor things to bring down this horror classic. Easily the most exciting and cleverest zombie film ever.",28 Days Later...
161,DavidSim240183,It's all the Rage,8,3 March 2011,"Danny Boyle, after a productive stint in television, moved into feature films with the blackly funny Shallow Grave. A confident, terrifically assured crime caper, it established Boyle as an immensely promising new talent burning on the horizon. He followed this up with the grandslam of Trainspotting, a coarse, gritty insight into the surreal life of a drug addict. It was a trippy experience, and one that won it a well deserved cult audience.The problem with making two impressive features in a row so early in your directing career is that you've set the bar so high for yourself. And when you make a film that doesn't scale the same heights, critics gather like jackals. And certainly since the twin hits of Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle has proved a very hit and miss director.After enjoying such unbridled success, Boyle plummeted to the opposite side of the spectrum. First there was A Life Less Ordinary, which only wound up baffling audiences. And then the nadir of Boyle's career, The Beach, which was quite possibly the worst film of the year 2000. The Beach is a film that could easily have torpedoed Boyle's career. And to make sure that didn't happen, Danny Boyle would have to come up with something special for his next film.28 Days Later... isn't quite the classic it seems to think it is. And its not terribly original either. But it was a definite step in the right direction for Danny Boyle. It brought back to him many of the plaudits he had lost on The Beach. And it was the big hit he had been looking for. The one that put him firmly back on the playing field.Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma to find himself in a deserted hospital. He goes outside to an equally deserted London. It seems he's the only person left in the city. But he's not alone. While searching a local church, he barely escapes a ravenous, red-eyed mob. He gets rescued by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark, and learns what's happened while he was out.28 days ago, a group of animal rights activists tried to liberate chimps from a lab. What they didn't realise was the chimps were infected with a virus. When they contracted it, it induced in humans a state of permanent, murderous rage. It wasn't long before it swept the entire country. Only a few have managed to survive. When Mark succumbs and has to be killed, Jim and Selena team up with a father and daughter to reach Manchester, an apparent safe haven from the virus, without being killed or infected themselves.28 Days Later... definitely sees Danny Boyle regain his stride. He tells a quite involving story of a man who wakes up to a world he no longer recognises. He does a fine job (particularly in the early scenes) of showing us a devastated London. The scenes with Cillian Murphy wandering the streets in almost complete silence are extremely eerie (although it is spoiled somewhat by the unnecessary soundtrack).The way Danny Boyle shot these scenes is a story in itself. They had to wait until the early hours of the morning to get the proper look of a deserted London. And they could only hold up traffic for a few minutes at a time. Yet the way the camera encompasses the London landmarks, the overturned buses, trash blowing in the streets - it's all quite dazzling in its depth and clarity.Danny Boyle also has a fine cast at hand. Cillian Murphy is perhaps a bit flat. By the time of Red Eye and Batman Begins, he'd polished his acting considerably. Here he's a bit introverted. He doesn't make a very convincing hero, especially in the second half when he's running around barechested with a rifle. Naomie Harris is much better. She gives a tough, determined performance that completely commands the picture. Yet she also shows signs of vulnerability, just as upset as anyone at the sad state of the world, hidden behind a cynical front.Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns are equally good as father and daughter Frank and Hannah. Gleeson plays Frank as an ordinary man trying to hold together in extraordinary circumstances. When he gets infected and knows he's about to turn on his daughter, his death is tragic and very affecting. Burns (who hasn't acted since) turns her slight woodenness towards a sad acceptance of what the world has become.The second half is a bit more predictable. When they get to Manchester, they fall in with a group of troops (led by an excellent Christopher Eccleston) who have lured them there with promises of a safe place, when really they need women to repropagate the species. I managed to predict that long before the characters did, although Eccleston gives a beautifully judged performance of a soldier doing what he thinks is right for a better future. Even if it isn't.Aside from a plot that's a bit linear, I was a bit disappointed by the ending. The film seems unsure of itself at the climax, as if Boyle and Alex Garland weren't sure where to take it next. The ending comes with a sudden abruptness that leaves everything unresolved. And the various endings that were filmed and storyboarded only confuses the issue further. 28 Days Later... pilfers a bit from The Day of the Triffids and Day of the Dead. And while it never adds anything original to the genre, Danny Boyle's kinesis makes 28 Days Later... a fairly scary world to look on. One I'm glad we don't live in.",28 Days Later...
162,SkullScreamerReturns,Day of the (dead) cameraman,2,28 December 2019,"This has been on my watchlist for ages. I never knew about the movie when it was new but at some point started seeing the title everywhere and started wondering if the popularity means it's some sort of classic. Now I did finally watch it. But it wasn't the classic I was hoping for. Quite the contrary.The concept is ok. Somewhere between Romero's ""Dead"" movies, Stephen King's ""The Stand"", with resemblance also to the 1985 movie ""The Quiet Earth"" the story is ok (yet reminds of those numerous other movies a bit too much, but that doesn't matter if the movie is enjoyable.)The real problem is the camerawork. There's ""shaky cam"", a lot of tilted angles for no reason, fast-forward effect, extreme closeups, random framing of the picture... I don't have anything against experimental ideas if they makes the result look good but here it just feels like this was shot by some wannabe-artistic teenager who doesn't know anything about camerawork and just tries to be edgy by holding the camera in all possible weird directions. I guess this kind of style was popular in the early 2000's (in the wake of ""Blair Witch Project""?) Even if the story was good it's hard to enjoy because all the time the visual style feels annoying to look at.Also, I didn't find the movie really scary. Even though it has horror elements I'd more likely describe the mood as unsettling in a psychological thriller style. The story is a bit better than the visual style but still nothing really special. Quite basic apocalyptic/zombie/survival kind of thing. Characters and acting are ok but nothing really stands out.Overall: I didn't like it. In the early 2000's there was a phase when I quit watching brand new movies altogether and started to protest by collecting old Dracula's and such. This movie makes me remember exactly why I felt that way.",28 Days Later...
163,PyrolyticCarbon,"Starts well, but a poor characterised script lets it fall.",3,20 November 2002,"This film starts out with high expectations; the opening scenes making you feel lost, out of place in familiar territory, and all alone. However, this quickly fades. As Jim is suddenly aware, and informed, a killer virus has wiped out almost all of the population, and you have to fight to stay alive, travel only in the daytime, and look after yourself, prepared to kill even your friends in the blink of an eye. Oh dear. Then comes the bad script, the really bad script. So after all this is said, what do the main characters do, even Selena who reiterates the very rules of the game? Yes. Walk into darkened areas alone shouting `hello', go for walks in the country, take valium to sleep all night, leave their weaponry to run around naked smelling of fresh blood. The characters contradict themselves on many occasions, and the hero just bumbles around pathetically. I shook my head in disbelief more times than I did for teen slasher flicks. There are some nice effects however, and the make up and filming are well done, even if the quality of the digital filming leaves a lot to be desired sometimes. Some of the plot is good, although you are reminded of a number of similar films and such like. The twist is nice too. Still, I would say, worth a miss.",28 Days Later...
164,pfgpowell-1,Rather good for the kind of film it is,6,18 July 2009,"Taken on its own terms, 28 Days Later isn't half bad. As a zombie movie it gets far better than half marks compared with some of the formulaic pap that is out there. In many ways the filming is rather rough around the edges, but given that it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by some sort of virus, that isn't half bad. There are plot holes galore and some very inconsistent behaviour by the main characters, but then I did stress that the film does oblige you to take it on its own terms and as long as you are not looking forward to an intelligent piece, analysing, say, the breakdown of society as seen through the eyes of some would be auteur, your on safe ground. In some ways the film is in two halves, with the second half when three of the characters reach apparent safety, only for the women to find that they are anything but safe, promising something over an above your average zombie movie. However, that promise is not fulfilled which is rather a pity. Director Danny Boyle does well on very limited resources (your average Tinseltown zombie movie will have a budget ten, twenty times what Boyle had) and the opening scenes in an apparently utterly deserted London are impressive given that the locations are real and that Boyle had to clear the streets of London completely for each shot. I have to say the desertion and desolation of New York city in I Am Legend is superficially more impressive given that film's greater resources (both films cover much the same ground, in fact), but the sheer bleakness of an un-digitally created deserted London carries additional weight. I'll stress, taken on its own terms Boyle's effort is rather entertaining, better than many glossier attempts. You have to take the story and characters on trust and suspend your disbelief, but then All's Well That Ends Well demands a similar commitment, so that is no great shakes. Just switch off and enjoy.",28 Days Later...
165,wrlang,Unique,10,6 August 2006,"A slightly campy rendition of the typical zombie film. The thing that sets this cult classic apart from other zombie films is its quick transition between fight/flight horror and every day concerns. Humor works its way into the script at key moments to let the viewer know all is safe for the time being. Just when you think all is safe, a dream or noise will bring back the fear and expectations of horror. While many non-brits will think the movie boring or disjointed, I think this type of film making has a bright future. No longer are film makers forced to keep the suspense or horror up for the entire length of the film, but the transitions back and forth are problematic because of the lag time the view experiences. Is this really a horror moment or something else? It takes some mastery to get that right for the majority of the viewers, and I think this film does an excellent job of that with its portrayal of the fast moving more animal like zombie. Another unique feature is the transition from human to zombie. At ten to thirty seconds, it leaves little time for decision making and adds to the immediacy of the situations.",28 Days Later...

The acting was flawless and the effects were excellent. The storyline was good also, however more toward the end it got a little off centered but that does not ruin this movie. Jim (Cillian Murphy) is a very realistic and likable character, one you would root for. Jim is the sole survivor (or so he believes) of what appears to be the apocalypse. He then journeys to find his parents and then a safe place to stay, and meets a few people along the way: Selena (Naomie Harris), a survival-obsessed, leader-like woman who is with him for most of the film, Frank (Brendan Gleeson), a light-hearted, good-humored guy who probably a SWAT member before the epidemic and has holed up in his apartment with his daughter, Hannah (Megan Burns); a shy, quiet girl, Mark (Noah Huntley), a sort-of nervous, side-kick type of guy, and a squad of soldiers at an army base, led by Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston). This movie cannot be called a ""zombie"" movie really, because the ""infected"" aren't technically dead. However, people will call this film whatever they want.

169,Gafke,Smart and Scary,9,24 March 2004,"A trio of well-meaning animal rights activists break into an experimental lab somewhere in England, intent on freeing the monkeys within. The only problem is that the monkeys, cruelly wired up and forced to watch loops of violent images, have been injected with ""rage,"" a neuro-stimulant which produces uncontrollable homicidal anger. Within seconds, one of the activists has been infected by a monkey bite. 28 Days Later (a ha, we have a title!) nearly all of England, and possibly the rest of the world, has been decimated.Enter Jim, a young bicycle courier whose last memory was being struck by a car. He wakes up in an empty hospital and soon wanders out into the wasteland that Britain has become with no idea of what has happened while he was asleep. He soon comes face to face with the hordes of infected, as well as with a handful of survivors, including a tough, pretty girl named Selena and a father and daughter who have turned their London flat into a fortress. I have heard ""28 Days Later"" compared to ""Dawn of the Dead"" (the 1978 version) more than once, although ""28 Days Later"" is not a zombie film, per se. It is indeed a ""plague apocalypse"" film, and a damn good one at that. The infected definitely do resemble zombies...really incredibly FAST zombies; no shuffling Fulci monsters here. The virus spreads quickly and is most often spread by bites from an infected, not unlike the zombie contagion. There's even a free shopping spree scene a la ""Dawn of the Dead."" But there's also a scene like that in ""Night of the Comet"" and I don't hear as many comparisons drawn between that film and DOTD as this one. ""28 Days Later"" is an intelligent, tense and powerful film, more than able to stand on its own no matter what it may or may not have been inspired by. The second half of the film, which finds our small band of heroes ensconced within a pseudo-military base with a handful of crude and desperate soldiers, is more harrowing and tense than any scene up to that point. Once again, it is the humans who are to be feared, not the monsters outside, and a deadly three-way battle between humans, soldiers and infected was both frightening and exhausting to watch. Everyone turns in an excellent performance, and a highly satisfactory ending left me exhilarated.This is truly one of the best and most original new horror movies I have yet seen.",28 Days Later...
170,david-meldrum,"17 Years Later ... Less Scary, But More Disturbing",8,27 June 2019,"Sometimes an experience of watching a film outweighs the quality of the film itself. The first time I saw 28 Days Later ... might have been one of those. My wife and my friend Andy saw it at a late night showing in the wonderful Stratford Picture House in the East End of London on a summer's night in 2002, in the first week of its release. A packed cinema was scared to within an inch of itself; Andy cycled home alone through London's by then deserted streets, a journey he still talks about with the hushed tones of one who never quite felt safe the whole journey. The next morning, England played bitter rivals Argentina in the football World Cup in Japan/South Korea; London came to a standstill during the game, during which my wife drove through empty streets to a meeting; streets eerily reminiscent of the film's famous scenes. Since then the film has acquired near-mythic status for me; a film by my favourite director that was so good and so frightening I couldn't revisit it.Until this day in 2019, a whole 17 years later. It's remarkable how much of the film I could remember clearly - it really had imprinted itself on me. The post-prologue scenes of Cillian Murphy's character wondering an empty central London remain astonishing and chilling; and as throughout the film, we are reminded here that Danny Boyle is a director who really knows how to use music. The atmosphere of dread is palpable, a sense that is more long-lasting and all-encompassing than the many effectively executed jump scares. Whilst the low budget is occasionally uncomfortably visible, the skewed camera angles and deliberately disordered shot compositions add to a sense of disorientation and surreality. The film is questioning: what's normal anyway? Who gets to say?Harries and Murphy are both excellent in the central roles; Christopher Eccleston's accent is further disorienting to those familiar with him from other work, throwing us further off centre when the reveal of his group's real agenda finally comes. Whilst the script does creak and strain under expository weight on occasions, the most disturbing moment comes in Eccleston's ""Slow down"" aside to one of his men, the moment it starts to dawn on viewer and protagonist alike how far humanity has fallen in little more than a month, how completely the 'normal' order of things has broken down. These revelations, and the moment when Harries' character watches the wrath executed by Murphy's in the film's closing action sequences (a final act shot through with the tropes of slasher and haunted house movies) point to something else, something we might now term concern about toxic masculinity. In the film's coda, Murphy whispers to Harries, sewing the dress she'd been earlier forced to wear, 'You know, you looked alright in that'; he may not be Infected, but it's possible he carries a similar virus. There are strong suggestions throughout that the Infected look for revenge on the living, but there's enough suggested in sub-text throughout the film to leave us wondering who the really dangerous ones are.The legacy of this film is significant. It consolidated Murphy and Harries as significant actors in their own right; it turned out to be at the forefront a rebooting of the zombie story to the forefront of popular culture, a wive we're still riding today; most importantly, it relaunched the stellar and varied career of Danny Boyle which was threatening to disappoint after the misfires of The Beach and A Life Less Ordinary. For that, I'm thankful - Danny Boyle's films have rarely failed to speak to me and change me. 17 years on from first viewing, this film did again; less scary, perhaps, but more disturbing and relevant to today's gender discourse than perhaps many of us realised.",28 Days Later...

I'd rate 28 Days Later in my top five favorite horror flicks, close to #1, just because the atmosphere feels like reality and a dreadful mood sets in every time I sit down and watch it. The movie has fantastic camera work, characters/acting, plot, effects, theme song, cinematography and just about all aspects of film-making I can think of.

In fact, it's pretty brilliant. The story is the typical post-apocalyptic survival framework until the soldiers enter the picture, when it becomes metaphorical and existential. Jim's transformation from a cowering bike courier to a rage-filled lunatic is quick, but it feels real, and makes the climax all the more thrilling. The film is making some pretty profound statements on humanity and the nature of survival, turning this from a pretty good zombie flick into something more. It's backed up by some gritty but effective camera work, solid performances by then-unknowns and character actors, great and fitting music, and, of course, lots of gore. The portrayal of the 'infected' is pretty frightening, to me at least, and the attack scenes are suspenseful and exhilarating. A top-notch sci-fi/horror.",28 Days Later...
173,johnnymacbest,Best Zombie/Horror/Sci-Fi film I've ever seen.,9,25 June 2008,"I just saw ""28 Days Later"" for the first time on DVD and I say it's GREAT!!! Danny Boyle has really outdid himself by turning the genre on its head and bringing something new and fresh to audiences and the critics loved it since it's first release back in 2002; especially Ebert&Roeper. True, the plot may be Sci-Fi in nature but on the surface, it's more like a metaphor for all the violence and chaos raging throughout our ""normal"" society and is so plausible that its really horrifying and disturbing. The ""Rage"" virus captures that dark aspect of humanity and the characters personify it beautifully unlike any Zombie/Horror movie I've ever saw. Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Red Eye) is simply awesome as is Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson, and Christopher Eccleston, all who give terrific performances. I really liked Megan Burns as Frank's daughter who comes across as resourceful but also vulnerable and innocent. There are many scenes that were shocking and heartbreaking that can make you feel sad and bring you to tears; especially the post-apocalyptic, deserted scenes of London, once teeming with life but is now an empty shell of itself. The only problem I have is that the ending was a little too upbeat. Still, 28 Days Later is the best film of the genre that I ever saw.

I thought the alternate ending was going to be such a break from the thread of the story that it was going to ruin the entire movie. It didn't. In fact it was indeed the very ending I expected.The overall feel is that of an ""artsy"" film - which scared me, but my fears were delayed when i saw the movie actually had plot, any ""shaky"" camera scenes were made very subtely, and I never felt bored.

Anytime I ask a person what is their favorite horror or thriller film, 28 Days Later pops up 9 times out of 10. For the past five years I have heard almost entirely positive reviews of the film but never managed to watch it. I wanted too but had trouble finding any time to do so. Finally it appeared on HBO and I was able to view it for the first time and I must say I am very impressed with the film 28 Days Later. After a first view I was no longer questioning why people found this film to be such a good member of the horror genre.The film begins with a virus known simply as Rage is released accidentally by a group of animal rights activist who think they are freeing harmless monkeys from a research lab. 28 days later, a man by the name of Jim awakens in a deserted hospital after being in a coma. He wanders out of the hospital to find that all of London is quiet and still. There is not a soul out. Through his wondering he is attacked by infected humans who seek to kill him. Jim is picked up by a woman named Selena who along with a few others attempt to survive the Rage infested United Kingdom and hold out some hope that somehow they will survive.Cillian Murphy has been making quite a name for himself as of late with such films as Batman Begins and Red Eye. He has shown extreme talent and a knack for playing villains but in 28 Days Later Jim stars as the protagonist. Murphy gives a solid performance. He seems well relaxed and suited for the rule and really shows off the fear his character is experiencing during the movie. This was no doubt a role that got him on the fast track toward success in mainstream films. Murphy overall gave a solid performance though there really wasn't much to it beside looking scared and confused most of the time. Nevertheless solid performance.In support is the beautiful Naomie Harris as Jim's companion Selena. Selena is difficult character to portray considering her complexity. She has more of a background then Jim which makes it even harder for Naomie to portray the character when their is more complexity. However, Naomie is quite strong and talented and does great in support, she also is something to look at in this overall dark film. Harris' performance is stronger then Murphy's simply because Harris had to act more, plain and simple, She is the force behind the acting in the film and I would not mind seeing her in more films.What makes horror films is the tone and setting of the film. One of the largest cities in the European Union hardly seems like a place to focus on for a horror/thriller film. However the tone is set in the opening shot of a deserted and abandoned London, England. Not a single person is on the street and you can't help but sit there and think ""My God!"" It is shocking and scary just to see a city utterly deserted. The tone for the film works perfectly and helps set the stage for the story in the film. Kudos to Mr. Boyle and his crew.Another thing that 28 Days Later does so well is the mysteriousness behind the infected. They are 'seen' numerous times throughout the film but usually very quickly for only a few seconds or in the dark for longer. This adds to the overall scariness to the infected. They are constantly hiding and can strike at any moment. This adds to the shock that many thriller and horror films fail to capture. Infected can come out at almost any moment and attack and most of the time the audience is shocked and frightened by it. I overall enjoyed the frightening moments and the dark lighting and couldn't help but feel a bit freaked out afterwards though that is not a bad thing, that is what a horror film should do to a viewer.The film is very dark and filled with violence and gore, some rough language and nudity. Definitely try to avoid letting kids who aren't yet in high school from seeing this. They will not understand it and will be horrified by what they are presented with on screen. The plot is not too hard to understand, mostly a survivor story and quite a good one at that. One thing viewers must remember is that this film is not meant to be a happy one, it is bleak and does not care much for the sympathy of the audience. You have to adapt to the relatively despairing feeling you will feel when you watch it. You won't feel too happy afterwards but it is a horror film so why should you? Overall the film is quite good, some characters aren't developed well enough but the whole plot and story behind everything makes up for most of it. Genius work by Boyle, a masterpiece of British film making.4/5 Stars",28 Days Later...
177,Cinema_Fan,Slow deadly nights and long crazy days.,7,7 January 2006,"This horrific metaphor for human disaster that is 28 Days Later works very well. Based on a story of Human despair and relentless hope for a new Birth of Man. Starting with a vision of Mans descendant, while strapped to a laboratory table, continuously forced fed to watch television clips of mass riots, murder, anger and hatred. His easily corruptible mind melting into mayhem and madness. Transcending Mayhem into Madness, Madness into Hate and Hate into Rage, rage that has not only infected the mind but goes further into the Heart and Soul of the Lifeline that flows through the veins itself.Mans ancestor is set lose, set lose by a group of unsuspecting Animal Rights Activists, thinking that they are doing right over wrong. One is bitten. All are doomed.Filmed in the deserted streets of a modern London, this apocalyptic human catastrophe is seen through the eyes of the seemingly sole survivor, Jim.Awaking from a coma 28 days (later) after the unwittingly failed rescue attempt of the infected simian, Jim soon bumps into the head strong and gutsy Selena. Who in turn find two struggling family members, father and young teen daughter, Frank and Hannah. The story continues as a struggle for survival, not only with a land of Soulless and rage-full Humans, but with the very people who they seek help from, a group of abandoned Army Soldiers. The courageous fours perpetual struggle is soon realised, and that hope and companionship is never abandoned, whatever the cost. This powerful warning to us all is never far from the truth, here we see a brainwashed Chimpanzee, forced to watch death and destruction. Turning its newly formed mind into a physical weapon, but what is this irony?Is not the Human Race a by-product of the manipulative mind of a raging simian? Is it not the simian watching Humans raging across the World? Is it not the Raging Humans, which are seen in the television footage, in the end, an influence on this fragile mind? The irony is that the rage was and always has been here, the watching simian was never the catalyst, he was an unwilling victim. We, as a responsible? Race have always brought it on our selves, we are the catalyst of our own destruction.",28 Days Later...

179,PeterRoeder,Extremely stylish horror film,6,25 May 2004,"I thought this movie was quite good until about an hour into it. After that it becomes stunning and hypnotic. It's just amazing. This is an unusually good horror movie. I thought it looked boring but then I saw in a interview with the great artist Clive Barker that he thought it was good, so I decided to watch it, and I must say he is right. It's very good. I really liked the characters. The girl is a good actor. The other actors are also very good. It's a zombie movie for the 21st century. It is also a great fantasy movie with very interesting spiritual twists, and not only violence. The scene where he walks around in London reminded me of my own day in London where I was all alone, and only managed to walk a little around the bridges. I went to ""The London Dungeon"" but didn't have time to go in. I guess everyone has dreamt about the same, that is, to see a completely abandoned major city. It's the ""what if...?"" fantasy. 10/10. Highly recommended and an absolute must for people who like horror.",28 Days Later...
180,bix171,Mostly Works,7,21 August 2003,"Danny Boyle's post-modern update of George Romero's `Night of the Living Dead' is more chilling than scary, but it's still a pretty effective apocalyptic nightmare--even though it never quite becomes the nightmare you want it to be. The film is filled with disturbing images of a devastated Britain that stay with you long after it's over. (A long shot of the town of Manchester seen going up in flames is particularly haunting.) Boyle has shot the film in digital video (the camerawork is by Anthony Dod Mantle) and it's a good choice, bringing a grainy immediacy to the narrative and allowing Boyle to indulge in some flashy but useful shock editing whenever zombies infected by a `rage' virus are onscreen. But the director and his screenwriter, Alex Garland, aren't content to let the concept of a country (and, presumably, a world) destroyed by infection be what the film is ultimately about and the second half changes direction, introducing a plot of lesser value about a crazed army major (well-played by Christopher Eccleston) whose goals for the future of mankind are intended to be as outrageous as the more gruesome elements of the story but are not, unfortunately, nearly as interesting. Still, much like `Trainspotting', Boyle brings his indefatigable energy to the proceedings and the intensity never flags even when the ideas get shuffled around. The young, eager-to-please cast includes Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and Megan Burns and they're up to a difficult task.",28 Days Later...

Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma to find London deserted--until he runs into a mob of crazed plague victims. He gradually finds other still-human survivors (including Naomie Harris), with whom he heads off across the abandoned countryside to find the source of a radio broadcast that promises salvation. 28 Days Later is basically an updated version of The Omega Man and other post-apocalyptic visions; but while the movie may lack originality, it makes up for it in vivid details and creepy paranoid atmosphere. 28 Days Later's portrait of how people behave in extreme circumstances--written by novelist Alex Garland (The Beach)--will haunt you afterward.

183,deepfrieddodo,Boyle's British Take,7,17 October 2021,"Limited within the confines of a 'Zombie' film, Boyle does excellently to add his own input to the standard storyline. As a Zombie film it is rather odd as for the vast majority of the time, there seems to be little in the way of looming danger, and whilst this certainly slows the pace down, it does allow for character development and some arcs which would usually be forgotten. Fortunately everything picks up for a brilliant ending, Murphy truly given the opportunity to show the range within his character. This is when the real action begins, the edge-of-your-seat climax and engrossment into the conclusion for the main characters and those surrounding them.Although it was purposeful choice, the visual quality of the film does leave a lot to be desired, as does the audio. It may provide the 'survivalist' atmosphere but isn't great for the majority of the film. Also can't figure out why Eccleston was given a posher accent, obviously the character doesn't have to be the same as the actor nor be from the location of the film, but they were in Manchester? Unnecessary, but forgivable given the ending.",28 Days Later...
184,whatch-17931,Overrated,6,10 November 2020,"It has a pretty compelling beginning, but...They drive through the tunnel, despite knowing how risky it is. And the characters are even joking about it.But the biggest problem is of course the troops becoming crazed rapists in less than a month. I don't care what they've seen, a very tiny percentage of people would give up hope that fast. Essentially zero, and the troops themselves have reasoned that this plague could not have spread to mainland Europe or America. It doesn't matter if the sequel has a rationale for how it might spread to those areas, the troops here believe it wouldn't.That's all just silly.The other big problem is Jim becoming a superhero in the last act. Suddenly, Jim can outwit both these trained troops and those infected with the Rage, and well enough to work them against each other.Also, it's quite painfully obvious the picture was trying to do some artsy thing about man's nature in that last act, but it wasn't earned.Aside from all that, despite characters knowing the extreme contagiousness of the disease, they frequently use weapons that spray blood enter everywhere.If you love this picture, sue me, these are my opinions.",28 Days Later...
185,shanfloyd,What makes it different...,8,30 December 2004,"This film is about a virus, 'Rage' virus that makes the infected person mad with extreme rage and hungry for blood. Within 28 days one outbreak in London caused entire Britain dead or evacuated leaving behind a blood-thirsty infected population and a handful of solitary normal persons. Civilization came to a halt, society got destroyed while those limited survivors fight for existence among frequent attack by the vicious victims.Sounds familiar? Then what makes ""28 Days Later..."" a classic among a horde of zombie/biohazard movies? Simply a touch of art that Danny Boyle is able to bring what others could not. The others focus too much on extensive, special-effects-controlled, gory action sequences between infected and normals, with heavy background music. But here there's always a tinge of sadness, emptyness, helplessness. Consider that empty London scene with that background music. We found out there's much else to show than just electrifying action or gore to describe the picture of life in this condition that these movies talk about.There are mistakes and loopholes in this movie. But that couldn't weaken the otherwise tight-gripping storyline. The greatest achievement of this movie is to make one viewer stay neutral throughout the film, without taking any side in the first place. Because the virus we talk about is simply used as a metaphor. 'Rage' is shown as a social disease. That makes it a 'serious' film, not a flick. Every person, even the harshest critic of zombie horror movies should watch this. 5 out of 5 stars.Oh, did I mention Cillian Murphy was awesome?",28 Days Later...
186,refresh_daemon,Better than mediocre zombie/disaster movie,6,3 February 2007,"Horror movies. To be honest, the great majority of them are pretty darn bad. The zombie movie: conceived by George A. Romero with The Night of the Living Dead and followed by countless clones and sequels. Most of these, like most horror movies, are pretty bad. At least Romero's films had some measure of social commentary to balance out the general ridiculousness of the films.28 Days Later does nothing to restore my confidence in zombie movies or horror movies as a whole. A disease breaks out and turns people into rabid killing machines hell-bent on killing all living people (but not each other). The dialogue in the film doesn't do a whole lot to help it make too much more sense. Then a handful of survivors try to... well... survive.Sound familiar? Yep. The zombie movie genre is actually a cross-genre hybrid of the disaster movie and the horror movie. Lots of spooky scares from zombies popping up everywhere and general gotta-survive-at-the-end-of-the-world tenseness. And it's tense and there are plenty of spookies to keep the audience trembling in their seats. The film (after the weak introduction) starts off pretty well, showing a post-apocalyptic London.Unfortunately, the film falls victim to a pair of problems that are opposed to each other. First of all, the setup takes a long time. There's a lot of running around with little character development. Second, the last act of the film introduces the film's ""larger themes"" which really serve against itself. I think if the characters were better developed and the story more thoughtfully wrought, then it would've been fine, but it all just drops out of nowhere and is almost a second story in itself. A lot of the development that happens in the first two-thirds of the film gets annihilated in the last third because the film takes a very different turn. And in it all, it tries to make a statement about the nature of humanity, but it's really cliché and poorly drawn out. Oh yeah, like many other horror movies, there are shower scenes and quite a bit of basic nudity, courtesy of the male lead's character.The direction and the photography isn't bad, although it stumbles here and there. The acting ranges from just passable to mediocre. The movie has cute references to other films and sources, which is neat if you can get them. But in the end, this is a slightly-better-than-mediocre horror film. It's okay for a once-over but I can't really recommend it. 6/10.",28 Days Later...
187,jpintar,Okay but overrated,6,26 October 2003,"28 Days Later has a very creepy first half which depends more on atmosphere than gore.  Now if only the second half were as good.  The movie does not keep up this cerebal part and instead goes for gore.  The fact that the movie has three different endings showed that the director was not sure how the film should go either.  The movie needed to get rid of extraneous characters and cut down on the needless gore.  Overall, interesting but somewhat overrated movie",28 Days Later...

The action scenes were good and made the movie more thrilling, however at times it was a bit difficult to see what was happening because the scenes were so fast.

Not zombies per say but so close to it, the ""infected"" were actually fast and agile instead of slow and lumbering. It makes a world of difference in how menacing and scary they are. 28 days later sports a very good suspenseful story that makes you want to see what's next. It has some quite intense moments and some brilliant memorable shots: the deserted streets of London in particular. The acting was quite good from a cast of relative unknowns (at the time). Special mentions must go to the evocative music and how the rain was filmed. It looked amazing and contributed strongly to the atmosphere. Overall, it's one of the best serious horror movies of the start of the 21st century. The only arguable weakness would be the original ending.",28 Days Later...
190,geminiredblue,It's All The Rage!!!,9,26 October 2011,"I have been a fan of Danny Boyle's work for a number of years now. He always finds a way of merging intuitive camera-work with a compelling story. When I learned he made a zombie movie, how could I turn it down? At first, when I started watching 28 DAYS LATER, I thought it was going to be one more standard-issue zombie film. But right after the chilling opening scene, I was joyously thrilled and confounded by his new breed of zombies. Though not entirely original, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD beat Boyle to it some 15 years earlier, his movie definitely redefined our old notion of the slow-moving, flesh-crazed, mainly-stupid zombie. Instead, we're presented with living humans infected by Rage, a rabies-like virus, that causes them to turn murderous. So onwards they come, running and howling like banshees. Actually, the zombies are kept to a minimum as instead we witness the horror and drama unfold as a handful of non-infected persons learn to survive in a post-apocalyptic London. And along the way, the film has some poignant existential messages to leave with us. To be certain, the film is chilling and uncomfortably realistic. In fact if there were some sort of real zombie epidemic, a Rage-type virus would probably be the culprit. But aside from that, look at what this film managed to do. It inspired a whole slew of fast-moving zombie movies including DAWN OF THE DEAD (the remake), REC, QUARANTINE (its American remake), BERLIN ZOMBIE (AKA: RAMMBOCK), and the upcoming WORLD WAR Z, to name a few. So please gentle viewer, if you haven't already, put this on your must-see list!!!",28 Days Later...

192,tburke85,28 Days Later A Good Horror Thriller,8,18 May 2009,"28 Days Later is a good horror thriller that is sure to please any fan of the genre. With a cast of relatively unknown actors at the time (except for Brendan Gleeson) director Danny Boyle effectively brings to life the horrific aftermath of a virus that decimates London turning the infected into smart and cunning zombie like creatures full of rage. For those of you who haven't seen it yet I wont tell you anything else other than that. 28 Days Later is much better than some other ones that have come out recently disguised as horror films. (One Missed Call, Shutter, and The Happening to name a few) The cast of unknowns including Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Christopher Eccelston and Megan Burns are good in their roles of characters struggling to survive the horror of a virus that has destroyed their home. Brendan Gleason is great in the small role he does have in the film. He provides some comic relief and his character eventually becomes a father figure to all of them. Gleason may not have a big part in it since (spoiler) his role is cut short abut half way through or so but he does a great job with it. Well done. The make up and effects for the infected were fantastic and it made them look absolutely terrifying up close. The music was also good adding suspense and it seemed to sync well with the tone of the movie. Overall 28 Days Later is an effective horror thriller that was much better than I thought it would be. If you're a fan of these kinds of films than chances are you'll enjoy this one too.",28 Days Later...
193,zac-04879,A Likeable Design Without Any New Ideas,6,18 September 2021,"28 Days Later only seems to demonstrate the typical surprises and basis you'd expect from any scientific zombie apocalypse tale. Although that's pretty much enough for the zombie fans to enjoy, the film lacks the ability to build on with any other creative themes or ideas. It mainly receives credit for the entire structure's skill to entertain, shock and anticipate audiences these days, since 2002.The opening scene, the introduction to the main idea and the development did absolutely fantastic. There's a slowly eerie sense of dread and it's very gripping. After around the 30-minute mark is where it also begins the preparation for a heavy horror climax, using awesome action sequences and more story development. It got less fascinating around there, but was too long to reach the exciting climax, which was slightly deficient itself.The only real stars shape around to be the hero and the heroine, Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris. Alex Garland's screenwriting also isn't bad, but isn't what you'd praise as much as everything else. So only a few fierce elements are able to rescue the boringly-excessive amount of action, adventure and ideas with the lack of strength.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",28 Days Later...
194,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,One of the scariest and chilling films of the 2000's,9,8 May 2007,"28 Days Later was too scary for me the first time I watched it at age 14. When I tried again at age 17, I was scared again, but it still kept me interested...all the way to the end, and boy am I glad I did. Witness the rebirth of the zombie/survival horror film by watching Danny Boyle's masterpiece, 28 Days Later.Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes in a London hospital to find that he's alone. That's fine, as many patients are alone when they wake. The problem is that he's literally alone. Everyone seems to have vanished. The hospital is completely empty, and as he journeys the streets of London, he finds they are empty too. Finally, he finds some people, people who upon seeing him, pursue him with the intent to kill him. Eventually, he finds other people who explain that the others have been infected with a rage virus that turns the victim into a rage driven killing machine.The film is more than visually scary, but the physical violence is quite brutal. The zombies themselves are very scary with what appears to be eyes soaked in blood. It's classic horror in the modern era, and that's why the film will appeal to so many different horror fans. Psychological horror and slasher fans will both be very happy. The film is also a drama about the fight for survival, centering on the characters played by Cillian Murphy (Red Eye) and Naomie Harris (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest). There is no real villain of the film, but Christopher Eccleston's character definitely can be considered a bad guy. And he does one hell of a job with it as a military commander. Murphy plays the classic hero, but at the same time he is not the nicest guy in the world. The ending shows what happens when you tick off a guy like Jim. Naomie Harris is likable as well despite her character's blunt and rash behavior, which is a sign of a job well done by the actress. Brendan Gleeson adds a sense of warmth in a supporting role, delivering, as always, an enjoyable performance.Danny Boyle's direction is stellar as he creates an apocalyptic vision that can really scare you to the bone. Like I said, not all the horror is visual and physical. There is also a good deal of psychological horror, and any horror film that balances physical and psychological horror is well on its way to being a classic, which 28 Days Later is. Written by Alex Garland, 28 Days Later is the best horror film of 2002 (Sorry, The Ring wasn't this good), and one of the top 5 of the 2000's. It's a classic that shouldn't be missed.8/10 --spy",28 Days Later...
195,tributarystu,A Pint of Rage,8,12 September 2003,"As it so happens, 28 Days Later is the best zombie movie in the last few decades. Probably since Romero's classics, if I recall accurately. It stands up on its own in a genre which is frequently plagued by a sort of innate stupidity, a consequence of one too many dead people. Otherwise how could one explain the fact that the most acclaimed zombie films are parodies of the genre? 28 Days Later shares a striking resemblance with Resident Evil, in that it kind of starts where RE left off: after one of the most exciting intro sequences I have ever witnessed (!), a lonely average-Joe, (Jim in this particular case) wakes up in a deserted London and takes a jolly good walk through the intimidatingly empty streets. Man-kind seems to have been wiped out by a contagious virus which induces a sort of blind rage upon those who fall prey to it. As may have guessed by now, this will be a story of survival.While most horror films will offer a relatively exciting ride with little more than sparse scares, Danny Boyle's movie sheds a new light on the survival instinct of human beings which can damned well spook the living hell out of you - even if not in the traditional sense. Looking at Children of Men might offer some insight into what it feels like to have no future and this itself may clear the way to appreciating 28 Days Later.I guess it's one of those rare horror films which not only enlighten the viewer with nice, gory slaughters but also with a share of psychological goodies. 28 Days Later doesn't forget ""the Master"" either and offers an obvious and unobtrusive tribute to Dawn of the Dead. All around the movie keeps you going because it is an immersive experience and not just a ""poke-your-finger"" kind of experience.",28 Days Later...

It certainly isn't as big as todays AMC's 'The Walking Dead' based on the year of release and budget, but in terms of enjoyment I personally got from it, it's close to par.

197,happyendingrocks,If only this was 70 minutes long...,7,8 August 2009,"Danny Boyle's apocalyptic postcard is as frustrating as it is brilliant. While the film's first two acts seem to suggest a classic in the making, the detour into redundancy climax and the limp ending derail the momentum Boyle builds throughout this often tense and truly scary visual delight. Perhaps there isn't a way to effectively pay off the superb opening salvos of 28 Days Later's set-up (I certainly can't think of one), but one can't help but wonder why Boyle chose to conclude such a thrilling and original concept with ""man is the true monster"" themes that George Romero guided to perfection decades earlier.If this film is a disaster, however, it's a gorgeously realized disaster. The shots of Cillian Murphy's Jim wandering through deserted and decimated London streets are worth the film alone, and it's impossible not to marvel at how Boyle orchestrated such powerful and bleak images within a city that is always teeming with life. The digital camera work here was unparalleled at the time, and the infancy of the format lends a sense of documentary-style realism to every image that serves the plausibility of the entire scenario very well.While most zombie-philes cried foul at the notion of the ""creatures"" in this film running at track-meet speeds toward their prey, this bit of criticism is the most undeserved. Firstly, there are no zombies in 28 Days Later. We are dealing with humans infected with a virus, which sort of negates all of the rules of the zombie epic. Secondly, if Boyle did somehow violate the mandates of zombie cinema (despite the fact this is not a zombie film), he certainly wasn't the first. Haven't these people seen Nightmare City? And the frenzied scene in the tunnel is one of the most exhilarating sequences in any horror film, ever, so it's hard to be too upset about Boyle's decision to think outside the lumbering box.What Boyle is guilty of is taking such an incredibly well-realized concept and squandering it by diffusing every bit of tension he built along the way in the film's silly and disjointed third act. This film loses every shred of power it has when our weary survivors meet up with the military meatheads who end up being the ultimate antagonists of the film. 28 Days Later ceases being a horror film at this point and morphs into a standard revenge flick, in which we have to accept the transformation of a lowly bike messenger into a clever angel of death capable of overcoming trained military personnel armed with automatic weapons, who also somehow has the wherewithal to maneuver his way through the series of land mines and repellent safeguards we are introduced to during his visit.It's also quite discomforting to learn that the impetus for these soldiers to turn from defenders of their country into Neanderthals devoid of moral fiber is something as base and animalistic as lust. It seems that even as the world around them is crumbling, the primary concern of this handful of people lucky enough to survive is getting laid. So much so that they are willing to murder innocents and disregard their humanity for a chance at some elusive nookie. Seeing them focus in on a girl who looks to be about 13 during this process adds an unsettling and sleazy undercurrent that is more than a bit uncomfortable to digest, as well. This entire subplot shifts the focus of the film so drastically it never recovers. Even the last bits of Rage-infected mayhem seem tacked on as an afterthought, and like the underlying theme, are lifted straight from Day Of The Dead.Though the DVD offers three different endings to the affair, none of them bring this promising tale to a satisfying conclusion. The ""bleak"" ending seems to fit the tone of the film most effectively, but it's telling that Boyle originally opted for an upbeat and joyous finale that finds our heroes about to be rescued by what appears to be a military aircraft (because their experience with the military worked out so well before?). This scenario confuses the message even further. If man is the greatest of all evils, why are our survivors so ecstatic to find themselves delivered into the arms of a group of men the same class as those who, left to their devices, would have murdered the dissenting Jim and raped his two female counterparts? So, this is definitely a film rife with flaws. But, for more than an hour, the world Boyle plunges us into is engrossing, realistic, and dramatically terrifying. The destination may be ugly, but the road getting there is full of beauty, and despite the ultimate implosion of the movie's immense promise, there are certainly enough flashes of brilliance here to recommend this film on many levels. It's just a shame that Boyle let such a near-classic slip through his fingers.",28 Days Later...
198,Gubby-Allen,For a while it verged on brilliant.,7,9 November 2002,"Maybe spoilers.For just over the first half of this film, it was on course to be one of the best I've ever seen. The script & idea were awesome and it was one where your mind could wander off and you could place your self in the lead role which is the sign of any good film.Unfortunately, the the plot moved onto the army scenes, the film degenerated into a bit of a farce. In all the post apocalyptic films & TV shows I've seen, it seems there's an unwritten rule that nobody can get on with each other after wards & consequently you end up with more deaths than the cause of the apocalypse. Quite why every member of the army had to be killed off I'm not sure.The acting wont win any awards but I don't let the acting quality affect my view of a film like other seems to. With so much crap soap operas on tele in England, you get immune to acting like that so it's not a problem. The acting here was competent, nothing more, but not enough to ruin a film.The film could've carried on an extra 10 minutes to let you know who was flying the plane, where they come from where they were going etc etc.The idea of post apocalyptic films is the most exciting there is as there is no right or wrong to it, but as of yet I've still yet to see one where the characters resemble how you or I would behave in that situation, and this, to a degree was similar. Nobody seemed to ask the questions any rational people would. For the lead girl character, who had much of the film, you knew very little about her.In short, it starts brilliantly, tails off badly in the second half, picks itself up again at the end but not enough to make it a classic.But nevertheless, I've seen about 10 films at the cinema in the last 2 months & this was comfortably the best. That's more through the others all being crap (Signs, Greek Wedding, Guru, Changing Lanes, Austin Powers etc). It's better than all of them & well worth a watch.7/10",28 Days Later...
199,basrutten,"Dark, atmospheric, and fairly good",8,1 August 2004,"I didn't know what to expect of this movie, but ""28 Days Later"" turned out to be a fairly good horror/thriller.The thing I liked best about this movie was the terrific atmoshpere. From the shots of totally deserted cities to the desolate manor later in the movie, ""28 Days Later"" really succeeds in creating a dark and creepy atmosphere. In addition, there are some good scary moments and some gore in the movie, but it never goes over the top and degenerates into a hack-fest.
The plot is above average as well. Although it borrows from other sources and has isn't always entirely convincing, it's good enough to carry the movie and has a couple of unexpected twists. It's also a lot darker than that of most (especially American) movies. I also like the fact that the movie gives you just enough information to figure out what is going on, instead of boring you with long explanations that ultimately only undermine the credibility. Ultimately, while this movie can be a bit slow at times and certain parts seem a bit far-fetched, this movie is certainly worth watching if you're looking for an atmospheric and creepy thriller. **1/2 out of **** stars",28 Days Later...
200,mistoppi,Excellent!,9,18 March 2017,"I like zombie movies, I just don't watch them as much. My current favourite is Shaun of the Dead, which isn't exactly that serious. 28 Days Later is probably the first more serious zombie movie I really like. Of course the problem is most of these movies have a similar structure to them. It's always about survival, having to kill someone you care, all that. Comedies of course take different kind of turns.Plot structure to 28 Days Later seems pretty similar to the other movies I've seen or heard about. There are still some twists I really enjoy, and very many scenes I like. But the main reason this movie stands out is because of the characters. I usually am not extremely fond of characters in horror, because you never know what's going to happen. But then I realised how attached I was to the characters of this movie. That realisation happened during some of the most serene and so very nice scenes, like the one at the grocery store. Those little scenes are so nice and heart-warming it makes everything else even more painful. You just want them to have nice, good lives, but horror movies are what they are.The cinematography is interesting. It's annoying at first, because it's grainy and really poor, but it keeps getting better. Also I really like the music in this film. It's simple, it amplifies the feeling in each scene, and it isn't just scary music used to make the scenes seem more threatening. It's a perfect soundtrack when you don't want to take any risks.All in all 28 Days Later is a great genre movie. Danny Boyle sure knows how to direct all kind of stuff, huh?",28 Days Later...
201,stevenfallonnyc,Hackwork,1,12 March 2004,"Wow, here's a real surprise...yet another film nowadays is nothing compared to the hype. ""Scariest film since ""The Exorcist?"" Listen people, here's the truth. ""28 Days Later"" is NOT scary in any way, shape or form. Not a bit whatsoever.The film is a huge letdown. It's a poor excuse for a zombie movie, ""end of the world"" movie, and all the other kinds of films it unsuccessfully apes. Now, you don't have to be original to make a good film. Even ""Star Wars"" has plenty of influences and many direct steals, as Lucas always freely admitted. So seeing ""28 Days Later"" rip off so many films is not the problem, it's just that it does it so poorly.The beginning of the film isn't ""amazing"" or anything special. It's a typically mainstream horror film beginning of a lame movie, that's all. From then on, the film drags and drags, until the last half hour, where a few interesting things actually begin to happen. Until then, it's a sleep-enducer.No, it isn't ""deep"" and it isn't ""profound."" it isn't ""intellectual"" and it isn't over anyone's head. It's simply dull.The script is horrible with countless holes and lapses of sense, and the actual filming and editing leaves a lot to be desired. Another reviewer pointed out that you really can't get scared because the editing is so poorly done when the zombies are around, you just simply don't get scared.Even a scene that started out decently, the tire-changing scene, turns into crap because when the zombies come around, the editing starts doing all the ""MTV video-style"" garbage. There's a real lot of that throughout the entire film. It doesn't add 'realism"" or make anyone scared. All it does is make the film look worse than it already is.There is one brief scene which is halfway decent, the ""mirror"" scene, and even that isn't scary at all, just a little suspenseful. But to be fair, a decent minute out of the film.It's not a matter of ""getting it"" or any crap like that. Plenty of films have done all the same things much, much better that ""28 Days Later"" strains so hard to do, and more profoundly even, if that's what you are looking for. ""28 Days Later"" is just simply a bad film that strains and tries WAAAY too hard.Really, this movie is just another reason why films on the whole are turning into garbage. The nicest thing I can say about this slop is that it is better than ""The Blair Witch Project,"" which was the biggest scam in movie history. (The scam being the cleverness in getting people in the theater to see that complete mess of a ""movie."" Can't anyone make a decent horror film anymore??",28 Days Later...
202,pkzeewiz,"Infected - but not zombies, get it right!",6,7 April 2010,"I recall when this first came out I kept hearing it was a zombie film and I love zombies so I watched it. I can see where people got that idea, but these were in no way zombies, just infected people wanting to attack.This film is about a man who wakes up in London and the entire cities population seems to have vanished. He is confused and soon finds the city is crawling with these crazy blood thirsty killers. He finds a couple of survivors and they tell him what has happened and they go out and their only purpose is basically to survive. They later find more survivors and hear a radio transmission from soldiers telling them to come to Manchester because there is a cure there. They head out and find there is no cure, no other survivors, but only randy soldiers.Danny Boyle had directed a few movies I enjoyed, Trainspotting being the one that stood out to me the most. His direction on 28 days later was some of the most beautiful cinematography and direction combined footage I have ever seen on film. His long wide angle shots and use of color was breathtaking. He used an 8mm for some flashback scenes and even those were so fitting and brilliant. The first of the movie with the boy waking up nude was a beautiful concept too. There is no better way of symbolizing being alone than being naked and bare. That scene was an homage to The Day Of The Triffods, but Danny's over the head shot showing how stripped and naked Cillian was, just gave such a nice setting and direction for the movie.Being able to get some heavy traffic areas of London shut down to shoot the scenes was wonderful, there wasn't C.G.I. and fake shots, it was real and definitely the best post apocalyptic deserted shots I have ever seen in a film before or sense. Dannys use of dark colors for the gloomy side of live and bright colors where life was to be symbolized was brilliant too. Later at the mansion the reverse of color after we find out the guards are wicked is such a nice trick too.The music and score for this film was so perfect too. It set the mood so well. Acting was great by everyone. Cillian Murphy did a magnificent job especially.I liked this film lots, and this was maybe my 3rd or 4th viewing and it still had the ability to keep me interested. I think I walked away thinking that people are the true monsters of the world.This is a drama, this is a horror, these are not zombies but they will satisfy zombie lovers as well as those who hate zombies. 6 out of 10 stars.",28 Days Later...
203,brianberta,A chilling zombie film with a deeper meaning,9,31 July 2017,"Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" is my favorite zombie film by far. It may not be as popular as some of the other zombie classics out there, but I think it rises far above all of them. It's not only an entertaining and well-done zombie film, but a smart film which has a deeper meaning.After a group of animal activists release a chimpanzee with a dangerous virus, a zombie virus breaks out. 28 days after that incident, Jim, a bicycle courier, awakens from a coma only to have to fight for his survival along with a few other survivors he runs into.My favorite aspect of this film is its political allegories. Its political allegories give an example of what the government/military would do in a situation like this. Boyle is saying that if a zombie outbreak were to ever happen, the government, soldiers, and politicians would be safe in a bunker while the rest of the world would be left to fight for themselves. You could probably get some help from the army, but they may want to get rid of you or other people traveling with you. They might even have violent intentions towards the people they keep with them. The military soldiers we saw in this movie went to unsettling lengths. They tried to rape Selena and Hannah, killed their own soldiers for disagreeing with their actions, and, most importantly, kept one of their fellow soldiers who turned into a zombie alive and chained up so they could see how long it would take for him to starve (an action which resulted in their deaths). Also, the final scene is delightfully ambiguous, because it makes you wonder whether the military will even try to rescue anyone else.The character arcs of Jim and Selena are also impressive as the 2 of them appear to swap personalities over the course of the film. When we are first introduced to the characters, Jim appears to be terrified of the zombies while Selena seems like a strong, fearless female lead. After she kills Mark early on, she tells Jim that if he ever turns, she will kill him in a heartbeat. After they discover two more survivors named Frank and Hannah, Selena appears to show little interest for helping them. Over the course of the film, however, she slowly befriends and accept them. The most important aspect of her change, however, is how she slowly develops a relationship with Jim as she said she would never do so early on in the film. As for Jim, on the other hand, he changes from fearing the zombies to becoming increasingly violent throughout the film. His first instance of violence is when he kills a zombified boy. However, the most notable instance of violence is when he kills several military soldiers in the final act of the film. This shows that threats to his life or threats to other people he cares for can bring out his animalistic instincts. My favorite moment surrounding their character arcs is how Jim reunites with Selena after he kills Corporate Mitchell. The scene where he gouges Mitchell's eyes out with his fingers is probably the most gory scene from the film (or, at least, in my opinion it is). It shows how much the outbreak has effected him. The moment when he reunites with Selena is very interesting though. Early on in the film, Selena said that she would kill him in a heartbeat if he were to turn into a zombie. However, the fact that she refuses to kill him (even though she clearly thinks he's infected) shows that both hers and Jim's character arcs are complete. I think that what director Danny Boyle is saying here is that you may try to act a certain way if you're put in a situation like this. Over time, however, the apocalypse will gradually bring out your true colors to a point where they will eventually be uncontrollable.On top of its deeper meaning, I also found it to have several memorable and brilliant scenes. The first of which were its shots of a deserted London. I thought it was impressive that director Danny Boyle was able to make all of those highly populated areas of the city look deserted. From what I read, Boyle had the streets closed off at 4:00 am and sometimes had only a couple dozen minutes to film. Another great scene is when Jim kills all of the remaining soldiers in the bunker as this scene is both suspenseful, but, like I said above, it shows the character arcs of Jim and Selena at their finest. Also, the song ""In the House, In a Heartbeat"" was well-written and memorable. It's one of my favorite soundtracks for a horror film. It fit the movie really well. Personally, I didn't have any major issues with this movie. I thought it was all masterfully done.In conclusion, this is one of my 10 favorite films from the 2000's, because of its deeper meaning. As I said, this is my favorite zombie film of all time (I even like it more than the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", which I actually consider to be overrated). I thought its sequel ""28 Weeks Later"" was alright, but in my opinion, this movie is the best that particular genre of film is ever going to get. I strongly recommend it.",28 Days Later...

The plot have some similarities with Day of the Dead and the beginning is very similar with Resident Evil's ending, but still there are some originality in it. The movie is well directed. The atmosphere is calm and some how chilling. The main thing what this movie is missing is zombies.

205,pinkliz41,A chilling British horror,10,2 March 2009,"28 Days Later is a hyper-kinetic and adrenaline fuelled British horror directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting). The film takes place in modern day Britain where a virus known as the rage virus has been used and has made all those who come into contact with it turn into blood-thirsty zombies.Boyle directs the film as if biographical, of this man who wakes up alone in a hospital to find no one is left, who then has to run for his life to get away. Boyle makes this an experience worth watching as he flicks the camera here to there especially when an oncoming attack of the zombies approaches.The setting is the key player from the beginning which evidently doesn't show any sign of stopping throughout the duration of the film. This helps create's the tension when needed to give the audience a thrill of insecurity about what's going to happen.",28 Days Later...
206,kyrat,"good, but derivative (mild spoiler - discussion of the plot's roots in BBC tv series)",6,8 July 2003,"I got the feeling that Danny Boyle watched the following British post-apocalyptic style series and then tried to make them more scary by adding in a more gory/graphic threat.In 1975 the BBC made an excellent series called ""Survivors"" which is very similar to the film except that the virus killed everyone instead of turning them into zombie-like creatures.  It was a little more psychological than horror, but similar themes exploring survival and what it all means to maintain one's humanity and how to rebuild emerged each episode.  In fact, one episode featured a military style dictatorship set up that expected to use female survivors as breeding stock.  If you liked the exploration of Survival and the fight to maintain humanity (both physically and mentally) behind 28 Days Later, you should check out this series (some PBS stations play it occasionally).In 1981 there was also ""Day of the Triffids"" (from the 1962 film) which also featured a deserted London and the banding together of survivors to keep safe from the attacking plants.

Specifically, anything human that has not yet succumbed to the virus. Their eyes go red and they start to snarl incoherently. Death is the only cure. There is a 20-second window of opportunity between exposure to the virus(through blood, saliva or any other bodily fluid you happen to encounter) and the symptoms developing.

Londoners especially will sense a distinct chill at this disturbing sequence, shot on eery DV which gives the entire movie (bar the epilogue)a rough disarming look, instead the comfortable crisp image of celluloid that we're all used to. I've never been convinced for the need to use DV up to this point, as 35mm film looks so good, but the overall effect works so well here that i've changed my mind. Rarely for this kind of movie, its not all running and gore; there's some particularly touching scenes, including the billboard in Picadilly Circus saying goodbye to lost or missing relatives (shades of ground zero) and Jim's discovery of his dead parents which leaves a distinct lump in the throat. Its in the middle section that the film lags, particularly on the journey to Manchester in which some character moments slow the pace down considerably, and the final third too closely resembles the Beach for my liking (you'll see what I mean) but at least Jim doesn't turn into a bad playstation game so its not all bad.

212,ilovedolby,`28 Days Later' gains its strength from its remarkable human approach in the wake of such horrific events.,8,20 July 2003,"Let's face some facts about the today's horror genre-it sucks! With moronic plot sequences accompanied by the worst bred actors, the level of expectation with such films is low. However, Danny Boyle (`Trainspotting') has brought moviegoers something new, yet almost traditional in the sense of horror films; a zombie thriller called `28 Days Later.' By using good actors, an amateur format for the cinematography and a decent story, Boyle gives us something that is not only horrific, but also terrifying in the very notions of its story. `28 Days Later' tells the story of a man named Jim (Cillian Murphy) who wakes up in a hospital one morning, only to find that the world he knows has turned upside down. What's more, there appears to be no one around. Jim soon realizes that the human race has been taken over by a plague that turns people into zombies. He then finds some survivors; one named Selena (Naomie Harris) who tells of the events that have transpired. In particular, how the virus is spread, through blood and other human secretions. As they search the city, they find an apartment building with holiday lights in the windows. They enter the building and find a few more survivors, a man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). While there, they hear a recording on a hand radio that tells any survivors to come to Manchester for help and 'the answer to infection.' But when they arrive in Manchester, they find more than they can handle. It's easy to admire Boyle for his great direction on this picture. The amateur film format is really the best trick up this director's sleeve. Because the print of film has a videotape appearance, it makes the movie appear raw and rough to watch. The camera, during suspense shots, is always shaking which gives the audience an almost dizzying feel to watching the movie. With the dizzying feel of the film, it also makes the story seem more real. That's where the real horror sets in-how incredibly real the film appears. Regardless of the notions of zombies, the idea of a plague, which in this case was manmade, administered to monkeys that got out of hand and harmed their trainers turning them into zombies appears in a realistic way. The very opening of the film centers around a break-in to an animal facility that houses these mad-apes and a botched attempt to destroy them. After that, for a few minutes we see news footage of rioting and complete social unrest in the wake of the plague as it hits the whole of England; something that could certainly happen when a society is faced with an unstoppable force. The acting in the film was very good. Murphy and Harris are great in their roles as survivors looking for an answer to the infection. But real credit has to be given to Gleeson for his role as Frank, a father trying to save his young daughter from the dangers that exist in their world now. We feel his pain as he tries to make his daughter feel like things are going to be all right. He does this by stringing up Christmas lights in their apartment window and binge shopping in a grocery store. In the end, `28 Days Later' gains its strength from its remarkable human approach in the wake of such horrific events, however, absurd as they may be. It's a great change in pace for lovers of horror films, not consumed by the commercialism that ruins most entertainment these days. ***",28 Days Later...

Anyways...A few years later and I decide to rent it - and I'm glad I did! In some ways this film scared me...not that it is a scary movie...but the reality I myself found from watching the film. After watching this I thought: ""Wow, that is a lot like AIDS!"" What do I mean...I know the filmmakers did not intend this for the film, but it was my own thought....Pure Rage reminded me of AIDS. Why? Well for starters, back in the day a lot of folks thought AIDS came from some guy having sex with a monkey from Africa (or a gorilla, or chimp, I can't remember)...anyways and people are infected if blood from an infected person gets into them. It attacks quickly and with regard. Much like AIDS. No cure is ever mentioned in the film - hinted towards- but no cure...Like AIDS! I know that may seem like a stretch...but think about it. It is a lot creepier to me to think of it in that context. I know that may seem preachy, but not my intentions. Merely stating an observation. The thought of comparing Pure Rage to AIDS made the film a lot scarier to me. We don't know all that we think we do about infectious diseases, which do not have cures.Off my soap box now...And who said anything about zombies? I have read a lot of people saying this sucks as a zombie film, or not enough zombies, etc. I did not think of this as a zombie flick.

216,MF210,I do not understand the praise for this film,4,11 December 2003,"My Rating: *1/2 out of ****. Almost every critic praised this movies this summer, especially Rolling Stone. The film also did fairly well at the box office (45 million is pretty good for this kind of film). Yet, when I was done watching it, I wondered if I had seen the same film. 28 Days Later is a stylish, occasionally suspenseful, and a somewhat inventive film. However, it is also boring, has unlikable characters, flat performances, an unintelligent script, a dumb ending,  and to top it off a moment of pretension. For a while, 28 Days Later appears to be something different from the normal zombie film. The scenes where Jim was walking through London are cool. It is shown as an empty city with absolutely no noise, this makes for a scary place to be. The film has a distinct look to it that reminded me of the look of The French Connection. Like that film, this look gives 28 Days Later a more gritty feel to it. 28 Days Later has atmosphere from the beginning to the end. Like I mentioned the film does have its suspenseful moments. The scenes where London is presented an an empty city. We do not know what is going to happen but were on the edge of our seats to find out what does happen. There is also a scene where the characters rush to change a tire before the zombies get them. The film also does a few inventive things. The look of the zombies are simple(Red Eyes) but it is effective. Also, I liked the way how the people became zombies (blood in the eye and the barfing was cool).
However, even though there are good things about 28 Days Later it has alot of bad points. The scenes in London are interesting because of the suspense and style. You briefly get to know the characters too. However, once the characters go on a road trip this film goes down hill. The film becomes boring and you do not like the characters. I mean not every film you have to necessarily like the characters but I really did not care if the characters died here. There is also a pretentious moment during the road trip. How out of place is classical music here?  The film also suffers from flat performances. As mediocre as the road trip moments are they are not the worst part of the film. Why in the hell did they get the military involved? This part of the film has such a tacked on feel to it. Its also really dumb and not suspenseful in the slightest. The ending is terribly bad too. I really did not want to see the characters survive at all. The film also feels incomplete because of the unintelligent script. Why are some of the people dead and some of them are zombies? If the virus was released into London why isn't everyone affected? I am not saying a film can not be open ended but the holes here are ridiculous. I was anticipating alot from 28 Days Later, maybe too much. Danny Boyle proved The Beach was no fluke. He really is losing steam. Yet, while The Beach was mediocre, 28 Days Later is just bad. It could have been good with a better script but from what I see here it is a mess.",28 Days Later...

It also combines creative visuals, music and sound. The film has a surreal silence for the most part, creating a claustrophobia which I really liked. This contrasts nicely with the bursts of noise during rage attacks Also some nice details like the Foley on the eye opening at the start Pity the ending wasn't approached differently, but you can't always have everything, and overall I got a lot more than I was expecting.

218,mirwais-orbit,Finally something to make Romero proud!,9,10 January 2008,"Finally a ""zombie"" movie to make George A. Romero proud with the new generation of directors and writers. Between hundreds of zombie movies that popped theaters for the last few years, there're no doubts that 28 Days Later together with Romero's second ""dead"" trilogy produced (and being in production) during this decade are by far the best ones already produced. The most funny thing is that this movie is directed by the most improbable of the directors to direct something for this genre: Danny Boyle. Yes, the Trainspotting one. The interesting thing about him is that he likes to handle with human limits, and this movie couldn't be different.Screenplay is signed by Alex Garland, and it's fantastic because it follows almost the same steps of Romero's movies, where a virus and zombies are just camouflages, trying to explain over metaphors and allegories a reality possible to happen in some near future. The criticism is always there, all the time, disguised as entertainment. It's truly a movie to make Romero proud with those ones that one day were watching his movies and are now being inspired by him.It's also interesting when we finally understand that the budget of a movie isn't responsible for its quality. 28 Days Later cost US$ 8 mil and had a US$48 mil gross, while the shameful Resident Evil trilogy cost US$ 200 mil and its gross hadn't achieved even the double of its total budget. These brutal differences should make producers, directors and studios responsible for trashes like Resident Evil feel ashamed of their selves. With Romero's words ""The best horror films are the ones that are much less endowed"".This movie is a precious gem among horror and sci-fi modern productions and certainly can already be consider a classic for the fact that it's based on classics.",28 Days Later...

It is quite similar to ""I am legend"" of Will Smith. However, you can easily tell that this one has a much lower budget as the visual effects and cinematography falls way behind it. In addition to that, the story turns out to be a struggle between a naked man and a brigade of soldier. The naked man is heavily assisted by zombies in outdoing the soldiers. The emotional breakdown of the woman who kills her friends in the blink of an eye is really an eye-catching performance. You will not hold back your tears. Joking apart, I think Europeans should stay away from Sci-Fi movies for they cannot cope with Hollywood not only in terms of budget but also in terms of screenwriting.",28 Days Later...
220,axlrhodes,10 years later...,7,14 August 2012,"Ten years later and Danny Boyle's lo-fi post apocalyptic horror plays as a mixed bag of success' and failures. Filmed on digital video cameras, the film has a raw quality that compliments the visceral tone stated strongly from the offset. Almost creating a zombie sub-genre of it's own, '28 Days' tips it's cap to George Romero (a shopping scene) and most strikingly, Day Of The Triffids. It's simple stuff, a virus breaks out that's transmitted via blood and saliva which causes it's hosts to become blood curdling zombies on speed. We see the world through the eyes of Jim (Cillian Muprhy) who after having recently woken from a coma, stumbles across an iconic London landscape bereft of human life. If there's a money shot, then this is it. It's a haunting sight that sets the film off with some strikingly memorable imagery. Like any film akin to the zombie genre, what follows is a tale of survival against everything and everyone. 28 Days is at it's best when exploring the world left behind but sadly falls short on character development. Brendan Gleeson's warmth is a welcome and likable addition, but Naomie Harris and Cillian Murphy aren't able to muster much, while Megan Burns playing the teen child of the group is career-endingly awful. What's most disappointing is the third act which starts promisingly but becomes all too formulaic and feels rushed and tacked on. Attempts to develop a love story between Jim and Seline (Harris) fall flat and in the end there is a feeling that style has overpowered substance.",28 Days Later...

I went into the movie knowing that is not just another zombie film, but that still did not prepare me for what I saw. From the opening scene with monkey in a clockwork orange chair, it kept me smiling at how intelligent the film was. Cillian Murphy gave an outstanding performance and I would love to see what this guy is capable of in the future. The opening in the hospital and the empty streets of London really made the whole atmosphere of the movie. The zombies were not scary, but I don't think of zombies as scary. The best thing about the movie was that I would have welcomed a death at the hands of the zombies instead of death at one of the humans (especially if I was a woman). First of all when I learned the intent of the army guys that is when the movie actually got scary. The rest of the movie was a perfect build up to man reacting to man. Not man reacting to zombies. But man reacting to the horrible nature of man. Not that the man react in a good way, but boy did he react. I reminded me of Rambo first blood, but instead of a big muscle bound guy it was a skinny little guy who was as scarier than any zombie. The social commentary was great and it really brought up the question of how many reacts under pressure. I loved how Cillain Murphy did not have to shoot anyone and literally ripped one of the guys apart with his bare hands. The ending was whatever, but boy was that a great movie. The only reason I did not give it a ten was I was not a fan of the female character even if she was really well acted, I did not think she was necessary. I actually think it would have been more powerful if the little girl was the only one who made it out alive. Great movie though.

This is not a zombie film for teens. This is a grown-up film that explores an interesting idea or set of ideas.In addition to being intellectually engaging, in addition to keeping me worried about the fate of our protagonists, the film was just gorgeous. There are easily two dozen shots that could be paintings in the world's great museums. I was blown away by this and did not anticipate it, so it was one of those truly pleasant surprises (the opposite of what I usually get from films, where people tell me how wonderful a film is and then I say ""ehhh, not awful.""

I suppose since teens spend most money on films, marketing it in a way that attracts that spendy audience would guarantee some minimal gross. But here I am, a real lover of artistically done films about serious subjects, an educated adult over 50, and this movie was really for me. Because of the marketing, I would have never known this were it not for the accident of the library being out of anything I thought I wished to see.

Wanting to gang rape an underage girl (or ANY girl, for that matter)... this was really uncalled for, and, for me, spoiled the whole movie. So the main priority for these men is to reproduce, while the planet is being ravaged by zombies??? Right...They could've come up with something more logical (and less disturbing), which would've made the movie SO much better.The acting wasn't great in general. Except for the father, most characters were too one-dimensional, unconvincing, and quite unlikeable. You don't empathize with any of them, and have no desire to root for these people. The awful acting only makes things worse.Well, I have to say the setup was quite good, though. And the zombies were convincing enough (unlike in ""I am Legend"").

To me, this was the scariest part of the movie, and it shows early on the skills director Danny Boyle has in creating a horrifying and suspenseful atmosphere.As far as I know, ""28 Days Later"" is the first movie that has fast moving, non-zombie/infected/seriously angry people who can infect others within seconds, so it gets a special mention for that. Although technically not a zombie flick, I put this movie in the same category as zombie movies, and it is one of the top 10, best zombie movies ever made. Yes, it has some shenanigans such as: the taxicab able to ride over a heap of abandoned cars in a tunnel; and the bad guys unnecessarily moving someone miles away from their base to kill them, which leads to an escape (reminds me of those old, corny James Bond movies where Bond escapes because the bad guy wants to be too fancy with the way he wants to kill Bond).

232,hoernkeem,"28 Days Later review (2002, Danny Boyle)",7,7 February 2021,"28 Days Later (2002, Danny Boyle)
Boyle has made a wide variety of interesting films most notably his breakout 'Trainspotting' and his Academy Award winning film 'Slumdog Millionaire' among others in a very good yet eclectic repertoire. This is his foray into the horror zombie genre. One could argue that the infected in '28 Days Later' aren't zombies per se, but a zombie by any other name. The story starts like most of these and in fact it really echoes 'The Walking Dead' although coming chronologically prior you could say 'The Walking Dead' echoes this. A group of animal activists break into a lab with a bunch of captive monkeys and the world changes when they let one loose. These particular monkeys happen to be infected with basically a zombie virus here simply termed ""rage"". Then we flash to Cillian Murphy waking up in an abandoned hospital and he walks across a stark, eerie English landscape that is completely devoid of people in a very post apocalyptic way. In classic fashion he wanders around oblivious for a while but then stumbles on some infected who pursue him and then a pocket of survivors including Naomi Harris who he latches on to. Then they find Brendan Gleeson and his daughter. Despite being somewhat formulaic this is very well shot and acted and good at ratcheting up tension which horror films like this rely on. The last third of this movie pivots to where the enemy becomes humans more than the infected which is also a common theme if you go far enough in these stories. I enjoyed this film but I would say it is not the most excellent example of the genre. That being said it does have some merit and is a worthwhile, entertaining watch. I just don't think it is doing anything that hasn't already been done.

In fact the first half of the film does enough to keep you hooked. The second half unfortunately is just plain daft. The atmosphere was the only thing that kept me watching. The church scene and the café sums up how spooky this film got.The acting was fine. Only negative is the child actor who it seems, was reading her lines by being printed on the wall behind the camera. The pacing was fine and the story of four uninfected humans trying to make it up north to a military camp was engaging. Thinking about, the whole film should of focused itself on there journey up to the camp rather than totally ruining it in the final act. And this leads me to the final act in which can be summed up by one word, terrible. You are forced to spend twenty minutes of your time by watching an infected thing run around a mansion like a fool. I love the fact that these zombies run at there prey head on rather than limping slowly but at times, especially the last twenty minutes, it made the whole film look daft.Is this film scary? i would say not. Is it fun to watch? At times, yes. Is it a modern day classic? No, for me, easily forgettable and with the last act being either a snooze fest or a barrels of laughs depending on your current mood, i wouldn't force myself to watch it again.",28 Days Later...

His arc is a strong one as he gradually assimilates into this new existence of harsh survival, and the rest of the characters are fleshed out too.New threats emerge, people show their true colours, and it becomes survival of the fittest and the egocentric. Nice people won't last long. There's never a chance to relax as the infected can appear from anywhere at any moment - angry, savage, and relentless. Grainy visuals and shaky camera work keep the action frenetic and chilling.

The clichés and plot contrivances rain thick and fast (hey, wonder what'll happen to that infected grunt they've got tied up out back?) before the bloody and bloody silly denouement.

239,ScottAmundsen,Truly Frightening Twist on the Zombie Genre,10,19 February 2014,"28 DAYS LATER... is a magnificent example of what talent, imagination, and technical skill can do on a minuscule budget. Filmed for only about eight million dollars in an era when most movies' budgets are in the hundreds of millions, director Danny Boyle and company have managed to give us one of the most truly frightening entries in the zombie genre, with a terrific script and the usual cast of English actors who always seem to me to have an edge on American talent; the people in this small, almost intimate horror film are individuals with distinct personalities, not the stereotypes one often finds in horror movies.The story, it has to be admitted, makes up in power and energy what it lacks in originality; Boyle and his screenwriter Alex Garland acknowledge debts to all the DEAD films of George Romero, Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND (also filmed as THE OMEGA MAN), John Wyndham's THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS, and other worthy entries in the annals of the zombie film. But it must be said that the genre is a narrow one and similarities are inevitable.Having acknowledged this, 28 DAYS LATER... is not quite your typical zombie film; the zombie motif has here been crossed with OUTBREAK and THE STAND. The movie opens with a group of very passionate but VERY misguided animal rights activists raiding a research lab and releasing a bunch of chimpanzees, despite the desperate pleas of the lab personnel that the chimps are infected with a virus that causes uncontrollable rage and that is highly infectious. Naturally enough, their self- righteousness renders the activists deaf to the scientists' pleas and they open the cages, and in very short order total chaos ensues and every person in the lab is dead.Fast forward four weeks. In a hospital, a young man named Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from a coma to discover that the London he remembers is no more. The city is still there, but the people are...just...gone. He wanders around calling out, and he grows increasingly desperate until he finally locates a couple of survivors: Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley. Selena, a tough, cynical survivalist, soon gives Jim a brutal lesson with regard to the Infection: once an individual is infected, you have twenty seconds before (s)he becomes a raging, ravening maniac bent on killing. And it isn't long before it happens to Mark and Selena, seeing it before Jim has even a clue, hacks Mark to pieces with a machete. She then informs Jim that she'll do the same to him if necessary.They move on, picking up a couple of other survivors on the way, until they hear a call on the radio from a quasi-military base near Manchester. The rest of the film chronicles their journey to this ""blockade"" and what happens to them when they get there. Some of the very last part of the film, at the ""military base,"" is annoyingly predictable; at least I found myself doing a bit of eye-rolling, but in the end it takes away almost nothing; the tension remains high even when some of what is happening on screen gives the viewer a touch of déjà vu.All told, this is one of the most exciting horror movies I have seen in a very long time. The director and screenwriter have taken what is an old horror meme and presented it with fresh eyes, literally: most of the movie was shot with a Canon high-speed video camera and the result is sometimes a jerky, almost stop-motion effect, only much quicker, that adds to what is already very unsettling stuff. And they are aided and abetted by a great cast that never allows all the ""horror movie stuff"" going on to rob them of their humanity, even when they are forced to do and witness the unspeakable.I loved every bone-chilling minute of this one; it may well be the scariest thing I've seen since THE EXORCIST.",28 Days Later...
240,w00f,This is NOT a zombie flick,9,27 June 2003,"I went into ""28 Days Later"" wearing my zombie gore b-flick hat.  I soon realized that this was no low-budget horror film.  This is a stylish, well-written, well-acted, beautifully painted exploration of the basic question, what is it that makes us human?  Why do we build societies, create art, and make sacrifices for others instead of just being animals?The question is explored through the interaction of three groups of people. First, there's Jim, Selena and Hannah.  They care about each other and the future.  They haven't given up.  They're fighting for a tomorrow.  Then there's the infected.  The infected are NOT zombies; they haven't risen from the dead looking for human flesh.  They're the victims of a disease that reduces them to an unreasoning, animal state.  They can't even feed themselves.  They're the destructive, self-consuming side of human nature, with no thought of the future and no reliance on one another.  Finally, there's the remnant of an army brigade holed up in a mansion, with no concern other than keeping the infected out and carving an empire from the ashes of the world for themselves.  They see themselves as the center of the future, and they're representative of the cold, cruel, calculating side of human nature.The infected aren't the stars of the film, and they're not meant to be.  The disease they suffer is a plot device that propels the question at the heart of ""28 Days Later"" across the screen throughout its brilliant cinematography, with its technique of blending stark, horrific realism with artistic, almost hallucinatory, images.  It's the tension between these aspects of the psyche that are really the centerpiece of this movie.The acting in this film has moments of real brilliance, and there are moments of real horror.  The horror comes not just from bloody images and graphic violence, of which there aren't nearly as many as one would expect in a movie billed as a horror flick.  It comes from the realization that the destructiveness and rage embodied in *all* three sides of the story exist within all of us.  Any of us could be the infected, or the army, or the heroes of the film.  In the end, the film answers its central question with hope.  It's hope that sets man apart from the animals and drives us do great things.  Even without the disease that creates the infected, we learn that our humanity perishes when our hope disappears.  That's true of the infected, and it's also true of the soldiers.Danny Boyle has served up an excellent, thought-provoking film that deserves better than to be billed simply as the reinvention of the zombie horror movie.  In fact, it is because of this marketing ploy that ""28 Days Later"" will likely escape critical notice and fade into oblivion, even though it is much more in the tradition of films like ""On the Beach"" than it is in the line of ""The Evil Dead"" or ""Return of the Living Dead.""  That's a shame, because this is Boyle's best work since ""Trainspotting,"" and a refreshing change from the usual summer fare typified by this year's crop of ""X2"" and ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" and ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.""If you want to see a zombie flick, go for it.  I love a bad, nasty, gory horror film as much as anyone on the planet.  I've thus seen enough of them to know that what I just saw wasn't one of them.  This may well be one of the best films of the summer, if not the year.  It deserves much more attention than it's getting, or is likely to get.  The scene of the heroes driving down a deserted road bordered with flowers that dissolve into something one is more likely to see in a Van Gogh painting than in a summer horror movie is alone worth the price of admission.  If you can stomach Boyle's mixture of graphic realism with artistic, hallucinatory imagery, and you're open to something more intricate than rampaging green giants and chicks with PVC pants and whips, go see this film.  It may be slow in a couple of spots (especially if you're expecting hordes of the living dead chowing down on live human flesh!), but overall it's fantastic stuff.  You won't be disappointed.",28 Days Later...

The whole film had a washed-out, slightly blurry look to it that I thought was a problem in the DVD transfer.  It was only when I saw Boyle being interviewed in the extras explaining the use of a DV camera, that I realized why the whole look of this film is terrible.  If they had used 35mm film instead, I would've rated it up a notch or two.Once again, style replaces substance in an ever technoid quest to *improve* something that didn't need improvement to begin with.  I want to see a rich, colorful landscape being portrayed on the big screen, not some mind-numbing to-look-at video-game.  The BBC could've shot something better than this. In fact, it looks like something they did shoot.The story itself about a plague destroying Britain is ok, I suppose.  The acting wasn't bad although it would be better suited to Los Angeles or New York than the UK.  That's probably why I liked THE OMEGA MAN (1971) better.

Granted, Boyle lifted a lot from Dawn of the Dead/ Day of the Dead, The Omega Man and most importantly from the BBC low budget series of Day of the Trifyds. The debt to the latter is the most obvious one where you can see that Boyle really almost took complete scenes. But Boyle achieved to create something that's better than all the films he uses as raw material. As opposed to Romero's works there is not an awful lot of gore although the film is very violent. But the fact that all the killings are done by hand rather than through firearms makes it seem even more real and immediate. The film is absolutely atmospheric and frightening, well paced and well directed. And that is also something Romero never managed. So essentially 28 days later is finally fulfilling the promise of a great post doomsday film- which Romero never managed to achieve because of his slow pacing and unreal violence and the BBC did not quite manage because of budgetary restraints.",28 Days Later...

Do not expect that, while there are some parts that do kind of get you, it is not really a horror movie so much as a movie about people in a desperate situation.  Second, it borrows from the Omega Man, and the Living Dead trilogy.  And finally, I hate digital video, especially with this film.  It looked like somebody had wiped their butt with the film print, and then sent it in, DV just looks awful.  I think that all of the budget was spent on everything other than film stock.  All in all though, it was a good movie, but I suggest that you wait till video so that you won't notice how horrible DV looks as much.  7/10 because of DV.",28 Days Later...
245,spacemonkey_fg,Danny Boyle delivers another classic!,10,8 March 2005,"Title: 28 days laterDirector Danny BoyleStars: Cilliam Murphy, Noah Huntley, Brendan Gleeson, Megan BurnsReview: I finally got to see this film after much anticipation and was very pleased. The waiting was well worth the wait. The film is effectively creepy and scary and demonstrates that not a lot of cgi or a huge budget is needed to effectively scare the pants of an audience.The premise of the film is familiar since we've seen this sort of apocalyptic theme played out before in many films. This time around my hat goes down to Danny Boyle for creating a truly deserted and isolated place! It literally looks like no ones living in London! No one! Except maybe a few rabid raging zombies here and there. This idea of a desolated earth has been done before many times in films like George Romeros Dead Trilogy, Escape from New York, The Omega Man, Mad Max and The Quiet Earth, so the premise isn't necessarily something new, still it manages to impress. Empty streets, news papers with doomsday headlines of contagion spreading world wide, missing peoples pictures all over the city. All elements that enhance the feeling of desolation.The main character Jim, wakes up from a coma to find a desolated world. This is one of those films that continuously makes you ask yourself, what would I do if this were happening to me? To me that is really something, because it lets me know that I'm really into this film, and in the theater I was watching it in, the audience had the same reaction. This film takes a lot of inspiration from previous zombie films, there are moments here and their that will instantly remind you of Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. I think its cool that this film takes inspiration in Romeros now classic zombie films. I'm fine with paying homage to other films, just as long as the filmmakers give it their own special touch, and Danny Boyle certainly did that. One of the most interesting factors from this film is the level of reality displayed. Never for a minute did I feel I was watching some popcorn/summer flick (not that I hate those) but rather, this film had a realistic tone that really augmented the horror scenes. The scenes that would make you jump out of your seat. Be on the look out, there are some genuine scares on this one! After you see how crazy and vicious the infected are you are genuinely concerned that one of those crazy zombies will pop out of nowhere an mess everything up for the survivors. In other words, you never feel safe.The zombie effects were different, not a lot o latex going on here, but trust me that is not a bad thing. These zombies look scary as hell...its all in those crazy red and yellow eyes. Its more about the ferociousness that they attack. The performances are great, and intense. I loved the chemistry between Jim and Selena. I cared for Frank and his daughter and wanted everything to work out OK for them! I really cared for these characters and didn't want anything to happen to them and that says something about a performance. I really admire Danny Boyle for making a truly horrifying zombie flick with such a limited budget. Yay for Danny Boyle, now go see 28 days later! Rating: 5 out of 5",28 Days Later...
246,RobertF87,Genuinely Shocking Horror Film,7,26 May 2007,"This film from acclaimed director Danny Boyle and novelist Alex Garland, opens with the release of a devastating virus, which causes extreme rage and aggression in it's victims, and then moves forward to 28 days later (obviously) where Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in hospital to find himself in a deserted and devastated London. Before long he realises that he is not alone, because the city is teeming with people infected by the virus, which is transmitted through blood and saliva.The film, which is shot on Digital Video, has almost a documentary look, and also makes for some impressive camera movements. The film alternates scenes of calm, and occasional humour, with sequences of sudden and brutal violence.This is definitely recommended for horror and action fans.",28 Days Later...

It starts with nary an original idea then goes on to borrow from every science fiction end-of-the-world / virus / contagion / zombie scenario imaginable. The plot is ludicrous and silly and the entire primate break-in scene totally laughable in a Plan 9 From Outer Space way. Every scene rips off another horror movie in a worse way. I'm surprised the guy didn't wake up 28 days later and yell out ""Brains! Brains!"" Who produced this poor excuse for a horror movie? Do I need to recount the number of silly scenes and their poor execution? OK: The guy wakes up 28 days later and, upon encountering the hungry zombies, doesn't even bother to ask what's going on. Yeah, sure. Later, hmmm... let's see...should I light a candle in an otherwise dark house to go looking for parental reminiscences with the zombies out and about? Who would have expected the zombies to attack? Duh. And of course, we need the obligatory shopping experience (where were the zombies then?) Every clichéd idea played out in a clichéd way (like the guy grabbing his two lovelies in the middle of the protected army compound when he found out they were going to be love slaves...oh, lets not use just a modicum of common sense and be a bit subtle about our plans). 28 days later, this movie stinks like that fish out-of-water of the same duration.",28 Days Later...
248,jazzest,Some Artistic Values But Overall Big Mess,4,19 July 2004,"This Danny Boyle's action sci-fi flick, which illustrates a nightmarish near future, holds some artistic values but overall it is a big mess. While metaphors of AIDS and nuclear war are well-presented, towards the end, political power conflicts and fights in the army ruin the chance for the film to be successfully coherent.Some notable merits include casting, art direction, and editing. The combination of a white male anti-hero type and a decisive black female is freshly contemporary. The opening sequence shows one of the most memorable sci-fi art directions in recent years: caged monkeys exposed to video monitors that display footage of war and violence. Fast-paced editing on attacks of the infected, without clearly showing the attackers, effectively produces the fear of the attacked.",28 Days Later...
249,piratecannon,The End is Nigh...,10,26 December 2012,"The first time I saw 28 Days Later was at a special on-campus screening when I was still in college. I remember watching one or two teaser trailers before leaving my cramped dorm room and thinking, ""Oh—another zombie movie."" It turns out my hasty assessment of Danny Boyle's gritty tale of horror and sociopolitical intrigue was grossly inaccurate, as this is so much more than just ""another zombie movie"" (and really, if you want to get technical, I wouldn't classify it as a zombie movie, because the overly-aggressive beings are, after all, not dead).The film opens with a group of animal rights activists breaking into a British research facility designed to study primates. Viewers are only given hazy clues as to why the sole lab technician in the building adamantly cautions the activists that they're making a huge mistake by releasing the animals (because ""they've been given an inhibitor"" that's somehow designed to presumably eradicate violent behavior in humans), but they fail to heed his warnings. When one of the freed chimps lunges at and bites an activist, she instantly becomes ill. Within seconds her eyes have turned red, and she's hissing, snarling, and vomiting blood. She's just been infected with the RAGE virus.Cut to—you guessed it—28 days later and our protagonist, Jim, is just waking up from a stay in the hospital. He was sideswiped by a car while delivering a package somewhere in London, and has been knocked out ever since. As he confusedly wanders out of the abandoned hospital, he discovers that there is nobody around—anywhere. One of the largest cities on earth is literally a ghost town. I don't want to ruin some of the great scares that are associated with the opening sequence(s), but rest assured that this movie is smart, well-acted (and directed), and utterly horrifying.28 Days Later had an almost immediate impact on me. Call it a heightened sense of paranoia in the wake of 9/11, but the idea of a biological attack incapacitating and ultimately killing millions of people is, at least in my mind, not all that far-fetched. Though it's certainly exaggerated here for the purposes of generating effective horror, this movie feels real. The attention paid to details it what gives it weight (as is the case with so many movies), and when we see Jim running in terror from a pack of aggressive ""infected"" who want nothing more than to spray blood on him and thus spread the virus, it's a chilling spectacle.And that, perhaps, is what makes 28 Days Later so effective. It all comes down to the very notion that should something like this happen, there would be absolutely no escape. There's no bargaining with those who are infected—they can no longer think for themselves; they're actions are involuntary, and are the direct result of being stimulated by bright lights or (and this is pure speculation because a clear explanation for their behavior is never given) the scent of those who are still uninfected.This taken on it's own would be enough to sustain an incredibly scary piece of horror cinema, but Danny Boyle decides to throw viewers a curve ball in the final act of the film. Like so many other horror classics, the term ""monster"" becomes loosely defined as people consistently demonstrate the seemingly innate ability to fend for themselves, no matter what. And, of course, the only way to beat fire is with fire. All of this sounds ambiguous I'm sure, but it'll make sense once you watch the movie, and it gives the conclusion of the film a certain subtext that might not have otherwise been present.The very name of the virus (RAGE) says something about Danny Boyle's intentions with making this film, and it clearly reveals something about Man; something that, as several of the characters assert, has been proved to be true time and again. 28 Days Later is scary enough as a no-escape exercise in aggressive ""zombie"" horror, but it's elevated to modern classic status by its unsettling observations concerning the true nature of humanity.",28 Days Later...

There is one great thing about this movie and that is the shots of Jim or the car all alone on the road or in the big city. They closed down the highway for a couple of minutes at the time to make this shots and it looks great. And when Jim is walking out of the hospital you really get a feeling what it must be like to be all alone. Other than that the movie is not that great. Jim, the main character, towards the end of the movie turns out to be a cold blooded killer, killing people without anger at all. What is that about? It seems a little stupid.

254,K-Slicer,Could have been worse...,9,28 June 2003,"I saw this movie because I had a feeling that it will slip under the radar and become of a ""UHF"" for the year 2k3.  Understandably, this film may be one of the best films in what seems like, at least in my mind, another summer filled with nothing but more sequels and lame remakes.  After I watched it, I came away with a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my money and time were well spent.Here are my reasons (spoilers contained): (1) This was a horror movie. There was enough gore and psychosis to go around and the balance between them was perfectly leveled. (2) The cinematography was dark and gritty.  I felt like I was watching ""Trainspotting"" again. (3) Even in a movie supposedly devoid of any real subject matter, there was a bit of thought injected into it.  I especially liked the ranting of the sergeant who was chained to the radiator. (4) Maybe I don't have a sense for knowing whether a film is predictable or not, I found it to be slightly unpredictable and that was good enough for me.  The last five minutes of the film is probably the best example I can cite on this point. (5) Danny Boyle knows how to work with a camera and a cast.  His exemplary direction of ""28 Days Later..."" gives weight to the notion that he one of the better directors currently in the industry. (6) Although nowhere near as compelling as ""In The Company of Men"", I was intrigued by the fact that humans are cruel to fellow humans when infected or not infected with contagious plague.  The one sets of scenes where Jim is talking with Selina and Mark in Jim's home, we find that Mark horribly describes his escape from infestation as people (infected or otherwise) try to escape those in the crowd who are miasmic. (7) Realism plays a key role in ""28 Days Later..."".  In a situation like that, you will never know who you will run into and who you will end up trusting, distrusting, or mistrusting.  I think if I were put into a situation like that, I might end up with only my brother, my third cousin once-removed, and my mortal enemy as my only companions.  I found the film to be a realistic portrayal of fictional circumstances. (8) I thought the best performance of the film went to Jim.  The man was a masterful lead as distraught bike courier and andrenaline-charged savior. (9) This was definitely a retreat from typical summer fare.  I think this might be the best film of the summer.  Nine reasons give a score of nine.My only beef was with the male nudity.  Too much can make anyone go blind but I guess it was deserved.  How many horror movies have been made with naked females?  It was definitely a retreat from the typical horror junk (like Jeepers Creepers III: He Comes Back for a cheeseburger and Jason XXV: Jason Dies From A Kick In The Shin by a 7-year old girl).  Overall, I found this movie to be worth the time and money so skip ""The Hulk"", ""Charlie's Angels"", and whatever other big name stuff that is coming out and go see something that will disappear fast.  That is why I saw ""28 Days Later..."" now because it may be gone next weekend.Here ends my rant!",28 Days Later...

257,scarletminded,"Ok, but seen parts of it before in movies like Cube and Night of the Living Dead...",6,9 April 2004,"May contain spoilers...do not risk infection...It was an ok film, but I was expecting more.  The acting was fine. I like the empty shots of London and the way the infected were filmed faster, creating a chaotic effect. But, I have seen this film before.  Ok, pieces taken here and there from other films. A film where people get thrown into a place where there are few of them and then turn on each other, while trying to fight for the cause.  It should be a sub-genre and it does get boring. For those who have seen Cube, people are stranded alone in a cube and have to work together to get out...and, of course, the cop who is supposed to be a good guy is the killer in the end, much like army people whom seem to be the ones who will help, become evil. I get really sick of seeing this plotline played over and over again.  No group of men could possibly want to help others, with their guns and hormones...there is nothing for them but to rape women? I find this very hard to believe. It is like I had to suspend my disbelief over and over again. Annoying. 28 Days Later seems like a lot of films I have seen. First off, Night of the Living Dead, when people get stuck in a house and have to fend off zombies. Except, I don't think the people in this film are zombies and that was a bummer for me because I wanted to see crazy zombies not infected people!  Anyhoo, this also reminded me of the werewolf film Dog Soldiers, where Scottish people in the army are fighting against getting infected with Lycanthropism.  Of course, there are fights between these humans too. The empty London area reminded me of Vanilla Sky which was a better film, though not a zombie or horror film.This movie has a lot of gaps in it.  I wonder why monkeys and people were infected by this virus but not other animals?  All the other animals seem fine.  Is that supposed to be a metaphor that the Earth is better off without us?  I am confused since many animals share a lot of the same genes that this infection would only infect primates. Why were scientists even making a ""rage"" virus?  Is it a metaphor that activists that are supposed to be good in this film, yet bring about its destruction? Was another idea that Selene didn't trust others, but when she did, she suffered for her trust? It was sad to see her strong character change into a whiny mouse, having to have Jim save her. It just seemed so stereotyped for that to happen. I wanted to see Selene fight!I was unsure if only the UK was infected, but I am positive I heard Selene say something about New York and Paris being infected before the TV stations stopped airing.  Then I read on some reviews that only the UK had the virus. I am also confused with the idea all of the UK is infected, yet England and Scotland have the highlands and many other far out areas, so it makes the idea of an all consuming plague hard to imagine...but it could move easily to the rest of Europe if one person that was infected got on a boat and sailed over, infecting people as they went. See that is my problem. Paris is much closer to London then, let's say, Wick, Scotland...yet Paris wasn't infected? Doesn't make any sense whatsoever. This film is worth a watch and is better than a lot of horror films out there, but doesn't live up to all the hype I heard about it. The characters and motivations are 3D, yet slowly slip into 2D stereotypes quickly.  I was hoping for more. Those looking for gore won't find it, people looking for a great storyline will be left in the dust too. It would probably be a good rental or something to watch when you don't have anything else better to do. 6/10 Zombies",28 Days Later...
258,InaneSwine,The most misunderstood film of the decade,9,12 November 2008,"This terrific film has turned out to be the most misunderstood film of the decade. Referring to it as a ""zombie horror"" is incorrect in its entirety: the creatures in the film are NOT the undead, but are in fact humans that are infected with a devastating virus that locks them into a permanent state of murderous rage; and while one could be forgiven for calling the film a horror, it is in fact a focus on human drama, as the protagonists struggle to understand and deal with their predicament.Having said that, the film does deliver a few genuinely terrifying moments, and the geysers of gore are frequent enough to keep the horror fans happy. The early scenes are the most memorable, as we see the deserted city of London explored by a formerly comatose Cillian Murphy, ignorant to the devastation that the virus has caused.Stealing the show is actor Naomi Harris, with her brilliant portrayal of Selena, while Danny Boyle's direction and John Murphy's music are close seconds.",28 Days Later...

265,hoxjennifer,Interesting take on the zombie genre,7,16 November 2014,"The re-invigoration of zombie horror in pop culture within the last decade can probably be attributed, in large part, to this movie. ""28 Days Later"" is not just blood and gore (although they do a good job of it), but it is a reflection on human society as a whole. The beginning is a bit slow-paced and slightly difficult to comprehend, but by the middle-end of the film, there is tons of fast-paced action. For those that like to ponder and analyze films, there are some interesting quotes in this movie:1) Major Henry West: ""This is what I've seen in the four weeks since infection. People killing people. Which is much what I saw in the four weeks before infection, and the four weeks before that, and before that, and as far back as I care to remember. People killing people. Which to my mind, puts us in a state of normality right now.""2) Selena: "" All the death. All the sh**. It doesn't really mean anything to Frank and Hannah because... Well, she's got a Dad and he's got his daughter. So, I was wrong when I said that staying alive is as good as it gets.""If you look past the seemingly pointless killing and blood-lust in this movie, there is a really deep side to this movie that tells us a lot about the good and bad sides of humanity. Just taking a closer look at Cillian Murphy's character, Jim, can exemplify this point. By the end of the film, we see his fight for survival and the protection of those close to him by giving into his own inherent violence. Similarly, Salena, whose only concern is for her own survival develops attachments to those around her and slowly starts to stop putting herself first. Excellent film - I would give it a higher rating than 7, but the slow beginning did throw me off a little bit. And, maybe because I'm watching in 2014, it's really not as scary as it's made out to be - but it does make you think.",28 Days Later...

267,Caps Fan,Chilling (Spoilers),8,6 November 2003,"Very few movies have ever genuinely frightened me. ""Natural Born Killers"" was an exception, and ""28 Days Later"" is another. If anything, viewing it again recently on DVD had even more impact.Maybe my having spent a lot of time in Britain had something to do with it. During the breathtaking opening scenes set in a seemingly deserted London, I kept picturing the situation that would have led to that. Seeing the main characters trying to survive and come to terms with what had happened, I kept imagining how I would behave in the same situation. Any film that can stir that kind of response has to be worth the price of admission.The characterization is one of the main strengths of the movie, but there are others. Music is used sparingly, but effectively. The use of digital video gives the pictures a pleasingly gritty look, in tune with what we're seeing. Violence is not shied away from, but only portrayed as and when necessary - and is used by the good guys as well as the bad.The original theatrical ending is a bit conventional; the alternative, provided on the DVD, is colder and more hopeless, but more effective. The 20-second time limit - once a person is infected with the rage virus, you have, at most, 20 seconds to kill them before they turn on you - might seem a bit arbitrary, but leads to two scenes of startling emotional impact. The second of these drew a unanimous cry of ""Oh no!"" from the audience in the theater where I first saw the movie.Recommended then, but not for the squeamish. Rating: 8/10.",28 Days Later...
268,joshuafagan-64214,The Definitive Modern Zombie Movie,9,30 April 2016,"The key to a great post-apocalyptic movie is contrasting the loud with the quiet. Everyone knows how important the loud parts are. Who wants to watch a post-apocalyptic movie with no action. Okay, maybe I would, but that's not the point. The survivors need to run into cannibals or evil military leaders or zombies or something to keep the audience's attention up. I've kept this in mind as I write my own dystopian novel, ""Coming to You Live From the end of the World"", coming out about two years after I get someone to represent it.But shameless advertising aside, quiet moments are as important. Relentless action doesn't give you time to breathe in your environment and get to know your characters. Even MM:FR had a good fifteen minute block of quiet in between all the madness. Any post-apocalyptic environment is by definition quite different from normal. That difference needs to be explored. Sometimes, it's ugly. Sometimes, it's beautiful. Sometimes, it's both. But it's always interesting when done right.And 28 Days Later definitely does it right. This is the best zombie movie I have ever seen. It is not the best piece of zombie fiction I've ever seen. The Last of Us and McCarthy's The Road are superior, and if I am to be honest, calling them zombie fiction sounds more than a bit demeaning. They are more than that. This, on the other hand, while there are a lot of themes bouncing around, is definitely a zombie movie. And despite what I have earlier said, that is not a bad thing.At the beginning of the movie, a group of crazed activists try to free a couple of monkeys that are being experimented on. The scientists try to tell them that the monkeys are infected, but like any group of people committed hard to a cause, they don't listen, and the monkeys are set free. immediately, one of the monkeys bites the activist and turns them into a zombie. Thus, the apocalypse starts.28 days later, the entire country of Britain has been decimated by the apocalypse. A man, Jim, who had been in a coma, wakes up and starts exploring the ruins in one of the movie's many great sequences. Soon, he meets two survivors, a man and a woman. The man gets overtaken by zombies, but the woman, Selina, survives, and the two of them run off. They soon meet up with an older man and his daughter, and the four of them make their way to Manchester, where a cure for a virus is said to be.The film does a great job of taking from the classic zombie formula while adding its own twists and turns and wrinkles, and the result is a brilliantly paced, brilliantly shot, brilliantly scored film that revived the zombie 'genre'.Our four protagonists have great charisma together. You want to see them survive this. You want to see them go off and prosper. That kind of investment is always important, but it's especially important for these types of movies, which would otherwise make the viewer rather apathetic.You never know which way they're gonna go, and so you're on the edge of the seat throughout the entire movie, but you never feel cheated or disgraced. Everything feels earned. And you are less confused at the end of the movie than you were at the start of it, which is the way these things are supposed to work. Bravo.I also love how this film fixes a lot of the problems I have with zombie films. This is not the first movie to make zombies move fast, but it was certainly a good decision. It makes everything feel more real, as does the decision to employ some sort of logic and reason. Don't worry- you won't get bogged down with information, but you will be enlightened. Movies like this don't have to employ completely sound logic, but if they do employ some sort of logic and stick to it, the atmosphere is enhanced.28 Days Later is enjoyable, terrifying, and a stunning piece of art. If you're interested in zombies or post-apocalyptic fiction at all, watch it.",28 Days Later...
269,Mulliga,Great fun...until they get to Manchester... (SPOILERS),8,27 June 2003,"""28 Days Later"" is not as good as ""Trainspotting,"" but not as horrifically boring as ""The Beach."" 28DL is sort of a mishmash of the concepts of the three classic Romero ""Dead"" films - ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", and ""Day of the Dead"". That doesn't mean it's bad, but like the Dead trilogy, it falls flat in the third act.It has several scenes that echo Night's ""zombie siege"" mentality.It uses Day and Dawn's post-apocalyptic feel (though, to be fair, lots of stuff is post-apocalyptic).The most blatant similarity, however, is the entire theme of Day's whole military-self-implosion thing. The soldiers were just like the soldiers under Captain Rhodes...perhaps _too_ obviously so. Like Day, it had an overly happy ending (a killer for any zombie apocalypse flick). If the movie ended with no soldiers and no base, and the gang continued into the countryside, fighting infected and learning about themselves on the way, the movie would have been a classic.",28 Days Later...

I was very much a fan of the performances particularly by leads Cilian Murphy and Naomi Harris. I'd imagine this may have been one of their first big roles and they were great. The cinematography was atheistically brilliant, some really good-looking shots with the zombies. However, if I had to pick out some negatives, I did think the writing wasn't amazing.

271,jcanettis,"Generally Good, But With Plot Gaps",7,23 July 2004,"""28 Days Later..."" succeeds in its basic target: To provide two enjoyable hours to its audience, full of suspense and action. Although it is a film that is characterized under the ""Horror"" category, it does not overwhelm the viewer with unnecessary and tiring gory scenes; instead, the director manages to achieve the horror element mainly through the psychological pressure that the plot generates. There are some quite scary and bloody scenes, yes, but they are not dominant in the movie; the fear, distress, and panic of the characters is what raises our adrenaline.So what is ""28 Days Later..."" about? The story is as follows: An unknown and highly contagious virus escapes a research lab, and it quickly produces an epidemic. The people infected by it enter a state of murderous and destructive rage, becoming in effect a form of killer-zombies. Within 28 days, when the civilization seems to have been fatally shattered, Jim (Murphy), a hospital patient who was in a coma due to an accident, wakes up and discovers a totally new world surrounding him. He begins a quest to find other uninfected survivors, of which there are unfortunately very few. In the process, he and his companions realize that there are more dangers in this new environment than simply the virus itself...Although the story is interesting, it has the problem that it features some disturbing gaps that cannot stand to some scrutiny. I do not want to enter into much detail here, as I will have to reveal spoilers, but what I can safely mention, without revealing the plot, is the following: The main point of the storyline is that the infected are portrayed as zombies who have no consciousness or logic at all, but their only activity is to massacre in a raving state whoever is near them; they do not eat, drink, or perform any basic human function. However, the above fact should mean that these zombie-people would be  totally unable to group together and attack others; instead, it is rational to assume that they would simply start eliminating each other, while their lack of reason and functional capabilities would make them easy prey to the rest of humanity who would probably isolate and cure or annihilate them without letting the damage spread for long. This is not what happens in the film however, as we see an unlikely scenario in which these infected zombies not only manage to devastate an entire civilized country without anyone being able to stop them, but they also form groups and attack our heroes in unison in occasional scenes.Despite these gaps, the film overall manages well. The actors, although not widely known, perform fine. The scenery, and especially the portrayals of the empty city streets and buildings, are fascinating, despite the production's low budget. A 7/10 is a fair grade in my opinion.",28 Days Later...
272,TheGreatMarkukini,Terrific fallout of a dumb mistake,7,9 May 2019,"If you are so smart to work with a deadly virus you at least have to think about a minimum security, but what the hell? If no then the life would continue as it was, so forget about the basic regulations and keep the infected specimen as they were just in the animal shop.What follows the major screw-up of a human existence is one of the most predictable but astonishing outcomes. Deserted streets of a big city, devoured carcasses of cars, empty buildings. That alone could drive me crazy. But what if you somehow missed the outbreak? Once again Cillian Murphy instantly catches your eye and ushers you into the doomed contaminated world having as little idea of what's happening as you.Danny Boyle has orchestrated an incredible show with only a few characters but on the massive scene. The acts interchange and throw you from hot to cold, at one moment you heart beats peacefully enjoying warm company and beauty of untouched nature and then it suddenly tunes into the rhythm of dozens of feet thumping the ground. That's when your hands get sweaty and through all those throat-tearing screams you can hear the death chasing your precious life.The change of the usual social ceremonies is shockingly cruel and incredibly convincing. Even the stranger valued more than anything, because you don't know whether it's a last human that you will ever see. But don't lose your vigilance, no matter the connection: friend or family, got infected - got killed.We all know that extreme situations pull the best of every person. Sometimes that best is the worst, so with all masks off you have to step on the path of survival. That's exactly what is shown in this grim installation of the world on the verge of extinction. And the way it's done is simply stunning: going from true friendship to basic human instincts ruling over the intellect.Looking over my shoulder I would say that the picture is a surprising example of a fascinating and thrilling science fiction mixed with horror, giving you both creeps and understanding that life worth living and even smallest things can bring you joy.

273,stevetseitz,"Ghastly fun, chilling and sharp (Spoilers!)",8,28 June 2003,"Danny Boyle tips his cap to George Romero's ""Dead Trilogy"" and Boris Sagal's ""The Omega Man"" a highly underrated sci-fi film starring Charleton Heston. ""28 Days Later"" is a crisp horror movie. It has the positives of being a gritty, realistic low-budget film without the drawbacks of bad acting, cheap thrills or pretentious ham-handed preaching. There are a few particularly horrifying (startling) moments in the movie including the scene in the church, the ""candle"" scene, the stairwell scene. On another level of fear: Excellent tension is sustained, both in leaving the city (an eerie tunnel sequence pays homage to Stephen King's ""The Stand"") as well as the strange quirks of the rag-tag military group. The final level of fear is the societal implications. Are we truly a society of consumer-crazed aggression? Is everybody else a danger to us? It certainly puts the condition of our species under the microscope. There is a scene in the film (in the store) straight out of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and the captive ""infected"" is reminiscent of Bub in ""Day of the Dead"". It is worth seeing in a darkened theater to heighten the impact.",28 Days Later...

Here's some of the major problems: If people caught this ""Rage"" virus and were rioting in the streets, how come their aren't bodies everywhere? I've seen red eyes before because of ruptured blood vessels - but the iris wouldn't turn red. How come England looked so sterile? With such a violent reaction to the virus, I expected to see a lot more damage amongst the streets and buildings. I can't imagine a British military unit being cut off from other military units.
The movie just had too many blatant impossibilities to make it believable. And if it's not believable, then it's not frightening - and not worth watching.Save your money and time and avoid this film. Just because it looks good, doesn't mean it is good.",28 Days Later...

276,nzpedals,"So scary, and it might happen too.",5,23 June 2015,"I don't usually click the spoiler button, but have to this time.The story starts with some activists who break into a ""Primate Research"" place. They intend releasing the chimpanzees from their torture. That's plausible, but... what are they going to do next? Crate them up and fly them back to Africa? Take them home and keep them as pets? But an attack on a hen research place wouldn't look so exciting? Artistic/Movie licence I suppose.Then Jim wakes up in an empty hospital. Nearly everyone else in the whole country has been infected by the Rage virus that the chimps had. Jim meets Selena and Mark who have some fancy petrol bombs all set up. Very handy when the ""infected"" attack. It might seem odd that the infected only seem to attack uninfected people? Oh, but if they attack each other, it would all be over in a few days. Another odd feature is that some of the 'infected' can run like Olympic sprinters, others can barely walk.The infected can sniff out uninfected like mosquitoes can find me? So, when Jim watches a tape of his parents, the glow from the screen is seen outside. In the ensuing attack, Mark gets infected, so Selena has to kill him within 20 seconds. Next, they meet another survivor Frank and his teenage daughter Hannah. Who needs who most? They need each other. They hear a recorded message on a wind-up radio from an army group offering refuge, but it is hundreds of miles away.Frank has a London taxi, so off they go. It seems strange that the only weapons they take with them are baseball bats? And then they find an open, undamaged supermarket. Unlikely since the norms of society have crumbled and 'infected' people cannot do the normal things that make civilization work. It would have been stripped ages ago? Will we go through this tunnel? Dumb idea, there are dozens of bridges over the Thames. The taxi charges through abandoned cars without being damaged? Except for getting a flat tyre. They stop to change the wheel. I wouldn't, I'd go like hell and get out of the tunnel first.Manchester has been burned to the ground - no fire crews to put it out. Scary.At the blockade where the army is supposed to be, Frank gets infected too, so that leaves Jim, Selena and Hannah who now meet the army guys. A Major and eight men. The men are depicted as ill-disciplined, uncouth and stupid. Unreal, but when one threatens to kill himself because the future is hopeless, the Major promises to get women for them all. Ridiculous. The suicide rate in armed forces is unfortunately quite high in normal times, and no one would suggest 'women' would solve that, although the Japanese did provide ""comfort women"" for their doomed soldiers. Fat- lot of good that did.Jim of course, sets out to defend the honour of Selena and Hannah, so the soldiers take him outside to kill him, but he escapes and with some help from infected survivors from the city, kills them all.They get in the taxi and crash through the gates. Fine, if the gate is made of polystyrene? Artistic licence again.We were told earlier on that Paris and New York also had infections, but Jim sees a con-trail in the sky that suggests that there is hope after all, so they make a huge banner that the planes will see.And they all lived happily ever after? In spite of the flaws, it's quite a gripping story, and well acted, but there is not one especially good scene and not much in the way of memorable dialogue, so I've only given it a 5.",28 Days Later...
277,Snake-666,Fine British horror!,8,7 June 2003,"Coming from England I have been very excited about the recent resurgence in British horror to hit the market. Dog Soldiers' was easily my favourite movie of last year and recently I got the chance to watch Britain's other main horror from 2002  28 Days Later.Some people have been calling this a rip-off of Resident Evil' but those people should know that the script for 28 Days Later' was written before Resident Evil' and therefore any similarities are purely coincidental. That's not to say that '28 Days Later' hasn't taken influences from elsewhere, some of the scenes are reminiscent of horror classics such as Day of the Dead'.At the beginning of the movie we see a group of animal rights activists break into an animal research laboratory to release some monkeys. During the break in a laboratory worker catches them in the act but the activists prevent him from doing anything about the break in. The laboratory worker pleads with the activists to stop and informs them that all the monkeys are infected with `rage'. They don't listen and free a monkey anyway, to their misfortune. 28 days later Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from the hospital bed he has been in for the past month or so and realises that something is very wrong, the city of London is completely deserted. After wandering around he discovers `the infected' as well as a few survivors. With only a handful of survivors the days of the human race look numbered, is there any hope for survival?What we have here is a very well written and thought provoking horror movie with some rather deep and meaningful subtexts. The movie is not as straight forward as what it seems at first, there are points made in the movie about society as a whole which require some thought about before they can be fully understood and appreciated. These sentiments are much like those found in Cannibal Holocaust' but not against a morally-corrupt backdrop like CH so therefore they have more meaning and purpose to them.There is some good acting in the film too, particularly from the young Megan Burns who plays her character, Hannah, as if she were an experienced young actress. Hannah invokes feelings of sympathy in the viewer because of all the hell she's been through; after all she's just a child. Her performance is powerful and realistic and should be given the credit it deserves. Cillian Murphy is also good as Jim, though one must question whether the dialogue written for him was realistic; there are certain scenes where it becomes hard to suspend your disbelief. Viewers are also treated to some quality direction from Danny Boyle of 'Trainspotting' fame.Unfortunately I feel that the second part of the film became its downfall. The plot suddenly seemed to shift away from the original subject matter and changed into more of a story about humanity's own self-destructive nature. While I agree that some of the issues tackled in the second half were exciting, intriguing and thought provoking I feel that they should not have made such dramatic changes in the storyline.One thing that works brilliantly for the story though is the virtual lack of character development. Normally I feel that a good movie should include a lot of information about the characters history yet here it doesn't. We know hardly anything about the characters that we are watching. How does that improve the film? Because the virtual destruction of humanity is being portrayed and those people who have survived don't have the time to get to know each other as they must concentrate on what is going on around them. The short bits of character history that are released into the film are all of interest to the viewer and keep the isolated and desperate feel of the film going. By not knowing who these people are we are placing blind trust in their arms. Before the outbreak of the virus they could have been serial killers, burglars, car thieves or some sort of general social scum, all of which is irrelevant now as they must join forces or they are finished. This point is similar in ways to the points made in the original Night of the Living Dead' about joining together to work for a common goal.Less the slight inconsistencies and minor deterioration of the second half we are still left with a very good, thought provoking movie that is definitely worth watching. Fans of the horror genre should enjoy this and also fans of Dog Soldiers' as both movies create a similar atmosphere. My rating for '28 Days Later'  7.5/10",28 Days Later...

This movie deals with a virus that makes people almost like mutant crazies that go around attacking other people. A group of people wander London trying to get back to ""civilization."" While the characters in George Romero's classic were interesting and you really felt for them, these characters are dull and sometimes act crazy themselves.The British accents were very difficult to understand at times. The climatic ending is in no way as good as Romero's film. In this film the survivors of the group keep trying to catch the attention of some overflying aircraft. They rig a big message and I guess they are rescued because the next scene is says it is 28 days later and the main character is in a hospital. Not worth buying.",28 Days Later...

Each one of his movie gets deeper and deeper into the trendy, boring mainstream.So here it goes: overenhanced and overstylized pictures, frantic editing, gimmicky and trendy shots, distracting score and sound effects, cyberbarf storytelling. Been there, seen that. Next, please.No emotions, no thrills, just trendy visuals, vaguely adequate acting and flashy editing. This is so mediocre.I'm looking forward the ending of this senseless trend in moviemaking, that puts the emphasis on performance and totally forgets efficiency. Even recent mainstream blockbusters as X2, the Two Towers, Matrix Reloaded, Pirates of the Caribean, Harry  Potter 2 all have at least SOME inner efficiency (not enough to my taste but well..), and don't rely entirely on gimmicky cyberbarf filmmaking. Studio executives seem to start to understand. They learn. Good for us.But as long as people actually buy this vapid cyberbarf stuff, we'll keep on having movies like ""28 days"".

I was surprised several times in this film, and I thought I had seen every zombie movie ever made! First off was the believable introduction. Like HIV, the Rage virus came from monkeys. Who wouldn't believe some scientist somewhere had a psychotic virus, and I'm sure those radical save-the-animalists would be the first to die from it! The second part that threw me was the church of zombies! I thought, ""oh, he just kicked the bees' hive, didn't he?"" Third was how the dad got turned into one! Just a drop of blood! I never saw that coming! I knew he was getting turned, but I was expecting one to just jump out and bite him, not just a measly drop of blood!

I know, technically Resident Evil came out before 28 Days Later, but that one doesn't count. 28 Days Later showed those tepid Studios that zombies are scary, and that people have an appetite for zombie flicks.Dawn of the Dead got remade, and it gave George Romero a B-12 shot right where he needed it. Now we've got the Diamond Dead to look forward to, and a host of other zombie fare in the near future. Now, I know this isn't your typical zombie flick, it's more about a virus.Same thing though, really. This movie was a gritty, in your face kind of movie and the first half hour is about as tense as anything I've seen.

Thought it would be better, since it's a zombie-horror film and I love zombie and horror films and everything I heard made it seem like it was amazing. Wasn't bad though. The way the movie was shot and filmed was great. Had an amateurish feel like a found footage movie. Also made the movie very realistic. Some good zombie action and lots of mild gore. Nothing that even remotely shocked or pleased me besides the eye gouge at the end(that was only a very brief ugh reaction though) but enough to really satisfy the non horror and gorehounds. The movie also had a good story. Not just the same basic thing you see in most zombie movies. Solid acting and likeable characters. Very intense throughout. Seen many zombie movies and that was the first time I've said that about one, because zombies aren't scary in my opinion. This movie was though. The whole opening 10-15 minutes where the main character Jim is just walking around London were really haunting and creepy. Interesting ending.

284,boondocksaint20,"Starts off great, but then begins an unfortunate suck-fest",5,15 July 2003,"28 days later is one of those movies I hoped would live up to its reviews. It is few and far between that you see a horror movie come out that is praised as much as this one and truly delivers.  I honestly can't remember when critics have now, ubiquitously compared a movie as frightening as the Exorsist and their claims to have been true.  Unfortunately, their claims about this one were mostly false.I won't go so much into plot developments...but the first half of this movie works pretty well.  We are given only the bare minimum of the source of the virus...which in this case, is okay, but just barely.  We are given incredibly great isolated shots of a dead city and a man left alone.  Jim, the main character, eventually finds a small group of people who eventually seek shelter with a squad of soldiers who are broadcasting a signal for survivors.  Through their trek to find the soldiers, the survivors encounter the occasional situation of the undead or the remnants of a lost society. Great direction, wonderful feeling of claustrophobic isolation, intense feeling of futile dread...totally high caliber material here...  So far the movie works better than great...however, the movie begins to truly suck once the survivors reach the soldiers.As a horror movie, this one is really not that scary unless you have a more vivid imagination than I do (and that's saying a lot).  The scares derived from this one are from loud staccato 'JUMP' scares, not so much tension or fear.  Though there are at least two geniune scares in the first hour, the rest of the movie falls into the category of mediocre during its second half, which should have been, given the story, its most exciting half.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***I'm sorry, but survival horror is survival horror.  Dawn of the Dead did this perfectly.  28 Days did not.  True, the soldiers were acting immoral, and I did feel for the women that they were trying to seduce in order to continue the species, but the finale, where the soldiers are the bad guys, in my opinion, truly sucked.  The movie was so interesting with the soldiers cooped up in that castle, that when they made it clear that they wanted the ladies for themselves, the rest of the movie simply falls apart.  There is a lot of holes in the plot that proceed this, and eventually, it becomes a story about Jim, trying to save the two women from the very people that would be their best chance at survival.  Sure, rapists are the worst form of life, and given the situation, who wouldn't at least think of wanting a 'piece of action', but I wasn't truly convinced that the soldiers suddenly turned this way in the story.  They were not portrayed as evil until the screenwriter say so, which ultimately leads to unconvinving assumptions. They are fine one minute, and the next, they turn into unconvinving savages that the script demands be wiped out.  I also was not convinced by Jim's sudden 'Heart of Darkness' spin that was only hinted at when he bashed a zombie off screen with a baseball bat earlier in the film.  Plus, we are given precious few insights about Jim's character that would promote even the slightest hint of simpathy of him.  What ends up is a bunch of 'faces' struggling to survive, and we simply watch to see which 'faces' end up surviving.If they were trying to convey a story about the struggle of 'humanity' even in its darkest hour, the last 30 minutes failed to convey said message.  All we have is a lack of explanation, a sudden mutiny, or change in character that causes the main character to escape and seek rather sadistic vengeance on the soldiers.  That is the grand finale, so whether you like this movie or not will be based totally upon your involvement in this movie 30 minutes before the finale.  I for one was pretty engrossed with it, until it became totally unrealistic, and just labeled the soldiers as 'bad guys' b\c the script called for it.  Sorry, but that didn't cut it for me.  I just didn't buy the utter stupidity of people during the last half an hour, but maybe others will, and in fact prove me wrong and say that they enjoyed this movie.  Opinions, of course are in fact, personal preference. 
Think of Aliens or hell, even Day of the Dead, and you have superior films that convey a much stronger message.  These movies are all about the acting, the emotions, the character studies, the split second reaction situations involving moral conflict...  This movie shows a couple of these situations very well, but overall, conveys very little, and ends on a note that really lacks emotion towards the survivors.28 Days Later should have been more than it was, but failed miserably in the final act.  It either should have been a character study, or a zombie flick, but tried to find a compromising medium which ended up being uncomfortable for this kind of movie, so it ends up satisfying few, and disappointing far more too many.  As I said, the first 90 minutes are pretty darn good, it's the last 30 minutes that are just plain horrible.  6/10 stars for providing a very convincing opening...would have easily been a 9/10 if only they had provided a convincing/satisfying finale.",28 Days Later...

Terrifying cinematography, crazy looking zombies and a terrifying statement about the evils of man when faced with its destruction all these things pulled together with some great acting by Cillian Murphy really brings this movie to classic status.The only problem is the girl Hannah was a bit of a bad actor, they then gave her pills at the end to make her terrible performance feel intentional but it didn't help the rest of the film.10/10 for this movie it introduce to the track in the house in a heartbeat by John Murphy my favorite piece of music ever made.Sequel isn't as good tho.",28 Days Later...
286,badgrrlkane,Why is this film labeled as a Zombie Film? It's Not!,6,15 December 2005,"I hated this film the 1st time I saw it, because I was expecting a British zombie film, similar to Resident Evil, which I had seen just a few weeks prior. However, 2 and a half yrs later I watched it again & have to say as far as a virus infecting the population film & turning them into rage-infested murderers, it was a very decently made film. I really like the director Danny Boyle, who directed one of my all-time favorite drug films, Trainspotting (a great novel,by the way) & the very good Shallow Grave as well. And then he has done stinkers like Alife Less ordinary, & The Beach. 28 Days Later kinda is better than the latter but not as good as the first two i just mentioned. Cillian Murphy is very good in this film as Jim. After waking up from a coma after being out of it for the past 28 days, he has no idea that the isle of the UK has been either evacuated or is dead or is infected by a virus called Rage, which was released by a group of Animals Rights activists, who upon feeling sympathy for the chimps who are being subjected to the virus, are let loose out of their cages, even while the scientist is screaming at them to not let it loose. And, upon the chimp being set free,he bites the female in the group, who proceeds to & after a visually distributing scene of her rising within seconds, hissing & her eyes having turned completely blood-shot begins puking blood all over her compatriot, whose then infected & then you see Jim awaken in a hospital. Unbelievable, as most coma victims can't walk for a few days after due to being bed-ridden for so long, but Jim gets right up & starts walking miles through the abandoned city of London ( which is visually stunning work,that Mr Boyle did awesomely, by filming really early in the morning,before the city woke up to go to work) & you feel for his character, the anxiety & fear he has, as he seems to be the only living person left in London. However,soon enough he runs into the infected & while chasing him he encounters a man & a woman, who save him & take him & explain what he's missed by being a sleep. Naomie Harris does a great job in the film as well. Christopher Eccelston shows once again that he's great at playing bad guys, as he plays the Military general who by leaving a radio message out to be broadcast to any survivors that he has the cure to the virus. Jim & company make their way to Manchester (on streets way too unbelievably without traffic) to find a Military group with only 2 things on their minds: Sex & Survival. And,Naomie 's character & the young 14 yr old girl are going to be the Breeders of a new generation, whether they want to or not. Some very intense moments, where you think the 2 girls are about to be roughly & grossly gang-raped & the scenes where Jim is being taken to be executed for not just allowing the Military guys to rape his friends & then him escaping into the wilderness, where many of the infected are still roaming, was scary. And,the infected black solider, who the live military guys have chained,like a dog in the backyard, when Jim sets him free to help him by attacking & infecting his still alive com padres was intense as he's scary looking.I loved it each time he basically, vomited blood all over the soldiers infecting them. Why, this is listed as a Zombie film, I'll never know as it has a virus being let loose on the public similarity like nIGHT oF tHE lIVING dEAD & Resident Evil, but in those films, they die first, then come back to life to eat the flesh of the living, hence infecting them. In this their living infected people who aren't interested in eating human flesh, just infecting new people. That doesn't make them Zombies,people.I also wonder, as they never mention it but was the UK countries of Scotland,Wales, or Ireland affected at all? And, i heard their in pre-production on doing a sequel 29dAYS Later. i wonder how their planning on doing it & will Alex gARLAND BE WRITING THE SCRIPT? Check this out if you like suspenseful horror where infected people want to kill each other. If you want a Zombie film go see any George Romeo Zombie film, or the remake of Dawn of tHe dEad from 2004. *** out of *****",28 Days Later...
287,TheBabblingFool,"Creepy, not scary, but overall really entertaining.",8,8 July 2003,"Regardless of whether or not you consider this a zombie film or not, it should be said that this film is not mainly about the horror of zombies in London, but more about human reaction to widespread chaos.In the argument on whether or not these people are zombies. There are multiple forms of zombies not only in folk lore and movie lore, but essentially the core definition of a zombie is a person who is under complete control, and will do a task mindlessly and non-stop under any means necessary. This definition covers the traditional movie favorite, a corpse come back to life to devour flesh, and the type of zombie in this film, people infected with a virus causing uncontrollable violent rage, and a lust for killing.In a neat plot device, if someone in the movie is scratched, bitten, or exposed to the blood of the zombie, then he/she will become infected in ten to twenty seconds. It makes the need to ""kill or be killed"" all that more important. It also eliminates the tired scenario of people being able to hide their infection until the last minute. As for the zombies themselves they run fast as the wind looking for people to kill, they are quick brutal and violent. In the film when a zombie attacks a human the camera pans around wildly, never really giving a true clear view of the event until the attack is over. Some may complain about this, but I felt it added a level of brutality to the zombies. Besides, it's a lot scarier to HEAR a zombie kill someone, rather than see it, because it lets our imagination make it as gruesome as we want to be.The film has many creepy elements, especially the sequence at the beginning when the main character is walking through the abandoned street of London, where nothing is left but himself and chaotic remains of a tragedy that has already past, and he is completely clueless of. This accentuated by the camera, I don't know much about film cameras, but this is of lesser quality, giving the shots a grainy, rough look to them. This gives the eerie ""documentary"" like effect to it, and it gives a sense of devastation, like this was the only camera they could find in the rubble of a destroyed civilization.Of course eventually he meets other people, who with them goes in search of more people, and that is where the real meat of the film is. It's main focus is on the interaction, thoughts and relationships of these survivors, and to what level they will go to ensure their survival, which is at times more disturbing than any zombie they could come across.28 Days Later is an engrossing horror/sci-fi drama that focuses on humanity in a post-apocalyptic nightmare, and decides to make it interesting by throwing some zombies into the mix. It's up to you to decide which is scarier.",28 Days Later...
288,willians_franco,A reasonable movie about zombi,5,16 August 2019,"The movie explores a post-apocalyptic vision. A group of people tries to survive the chaos caused by a worldwide epidemic of a type of rabies virus, and try to find a place to live under the threat of insatiable zombies.
Although many find this movie one of the best movies about zombies, I disagree. For me, it is just watchable and average, and the value they attach to it is overestimated. It's not scary at all. It's a bit like ""The Walking Dead"". The outcome of the film leaves much to be desired. There is a lack of logic and coherence in many passages due to defects in the script. The shallow performance of some of the characters does not give credibility to an apocalyptic situation of this magnitude. Some passages are dragged and monotonous. A possible highlight is a post-apocalyptic scenario in London, showing the city, streets and deserted avenues.
Movie indicated especially for the fans of the series ""The Walking Dead"". In particular, I don't recommend it, and I give it an average grade.",28 Days Later...

I liked all the different characters and wanted them to survive, this made it hurt more if they didn't. The zombies aren't overused but remain in the back of your mind constantly. I also really liked the cinematography, lighting and soundtrack which all add to the atmosphere. Even when the characters were safe it always felt as if something was off which I really liked.

Being British I am acutely aware of the tropes of UK produced cinema and those cliches don't engage me now, or more to the point I am perhaps more aware of them. 28 Days Later seems prosaic and fettered by these production values and that spoiled my watching experience.

292,victor7754,A low budget Digital Video masterpiece,7,11 July 2003,"28 days later is a perfect example of what it takes to make a lowbudget film.  It has all the ingredients.  It also displays thetechnical aspect and wonder of digital video.  A horror/science fiction film that combines an intriguing story withsome fantastic lighting.  The beauty of the movie lies mainly in it'scamera work.  The actors are strong and provide staying power. The digital quality is not perfect but due to being a ""horror"" film, it isdead on.  There are moments when the director capturescharacters through windows using reflections and lighting.  It isthis imagery that constantly parades throughout the movie andproves the capability of digital video.The film is very stylish and the story is complete with a wellstructured screenplay.  We have two endings; so pay attention. Wehave one where they make it and live happily ever after and wehave one where there is no escape against ""Rage"", the virus thathas a rabies type effect within 20 seconds. ""Hell"" I believe wasbriefly written out only to become a ""hello""There is gore and some sexual moments.  There is a fatalisticphilosophy about our future that comes up quite often but isrebuked by hope.  The film can be an allegory on drugs if anything.  Crack and CrystalMeth. Heroin make people into zombies and make them feed offothers, not on each other.  Four stars for their efforts.  The film holds attention and captivatesthe senses.  It proves once again that a low budget horror film isthe way to go to gain capital for a more expansive film project. Thank you for giving me hope.",28 Days Later...
293,Mister-Creeper,An Interesting And New Take On Zombie Films,8,15 August 2007,"28 DAYS LATER definitely adds a new twist to zombie movies as we've come to know them, but not always is that twist a bad thing. I'll admit, I wasn't sure if I was gonna like the whole fast-paced, running zombies thing. I've always been a fan of the slow, more deathlike zombies...they just seem a lot creepier. Then, I watched this film, and I must say it was a lot better than I had anticipated it being. I definitely do not agree that it has been ""hailed as the most frightening film since The Exorcist."" That statement(quote)is way off! I didn't find it as a very scary film, although there is a couple scenes that were a little terrifying...but I did find it pretty entertaining. It has a lot of action mixed into it and does a very good job of combining the two(action and horror). Overall I enjoyed this film very much, but thought it was a bit too long, especially the opening scenes. The visuals were great. All in all, this film is well worth taking a look at.",28 Days Later...

295,jbar19,Potentially very good movie sunk by plot holes,6,18 June 2003,"OK, the film makers get great marks for some impressive and powerful footage of an abandoned London. The acting was very strong and the film moves at a crisp pace. Overall, the film accomplishes a lot on an obvious shoe string budget.But this script could have used a rewrite or two. The story is too contrived. There are too many implausibilities to ignore. If the author could have made the story more believable this could have been a powerful movie. Perhaps, the budget was too tight to resolve the major plot holes.
The whole virus should have been explained a little more. It just seems to be an excuse to introduce 'classic' zombies into the movie. The scenes with the soldiers are just the writer's attempt to make a 'Lord of the Flies' type of statement and should have been omitted as they distract from the terror of the main characters fleeing from Zombie London.The idea of a handful of people surviving a virus that wiped out a city is good. The fact that the survivors are hunted by the virus victims is great. But this movie quickly takes a wrong turn and just ends up as another hack and slash revenge flick.In a nutshell I was disappointed by this movie. It was stylish, clever and well paced and acted, but the story itself is too flawed to be taken seriously. This movie was 3 rewrites away from being great.It had me, then it lost me.",28 Days Later...
296,Stibbert,Great zombie movie!,8,10 October 2005,"And what's so great about it is that there are almost no zombies in it! Many movies tend to have a literally over kill of zombies. This movie on the other hand gives a more realistic and focus more about the humans involved and how the whole scenario affects them.The UK suffers a outbreak of highly contagious virus that makes people very aggressive and violent. 28 days later Jim wakes up in the hospital noticing he is the only one around. When he meets a couple of other survivors their quest for salvage begins.28 days later is a good movie and nothing less. The story is good and believable. It makes sense and is not too far-fetched. The story is well written. There are nice changes of mood and tempo. The characters are strong and believable as well. What I really like about it was that it focused more on the characters and the story then on the blood and gore. It didn't scare me as a horror movie with monsters jumping at you and a suspense and haunting music, but it's scaring in a deeper way. It shows what humans are possible of. People don't really need to be infected be a virus to do these things. That makes it much more than a horror film.The actors does a good job. You believe them and they portray the characters well. Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and Megan Burns makes a strong trio in the lead.The cinematographer does a great job in capturing the different moods and pace of the film. It changes more than once and every time it's good. There are shots that are tense and get you all on your toes and there are shots you just lay back and enjoy cause of their beauty. The cinematography features out of the ordinary shots and is all in all very good.The score is something rock like with guitar and drums and it's really nice. It's dramatic and action filled. However, there are also sequences with no music. It's just the empty sound of no one else. It accentuates the element of the emptiness.The makeup and effects are also good. However, might contradicting to the genre this is not a gore filled movie. Never the less, the effects you see are good.So, if you're looking for a good entertaining and enjoyable movie with feeling, humanity and not just the superficial ""kill the zombie"" then this should be your movie of choice.",28 Days Later...

From the start, it establishes an atmosphere of gloom and chaos that never lets up. What I found very interesting about it was its portrayal of human instincts and evils that we all can possess in our darkest hours.

Now that is over, 28 days later is a British masterpiece and a piece of British film history. Forget Dawn of The Dead and even Land of The Dead, they were good enough films but they never gave you that tingling feeling of realism, when you watch 28 Days Later you shake and quiver in fear and anticipation, well I did anyway!The scene of empty London streets and the feeling of loneliness Cillian Murphy feels when he leaves the hospital, it's unique! Also you get that end of the world feeling that Night of The Living Dead failed (in my view) to give off.

It takes a classic plot (which has been done quite a few times... to the point where the zombie film was considered extinct) and reimagined it with fast running zombies, unique and stylish cinematography and really, really great acting. The cast is truly great in this film and everyone gives great performances.The midpoint of this film (involving a crow and a corpse) is such an amazing and powerful scene and just goes to show how well written and structured the film is. I found the climax to be almost melodramatic in a way, but I wouldn't have it any other way.It's movies like this that should be inspiring younger film makers... not Marvel films or Netflix originals... This is a great example of terrific film making, using an old plot but restyling in a way that feels completely fresh. It's extremely well written yet so simple. It's a perfect script that's structured so well, allowing the director with his actors and cinematography to really to really shine. The truth is that great movies often wear their influences on their sleeves. This one is obviously inspired by every zombie film made before it yet feels so original. It takes a certain amount of studying of what makes a great film to be able to deliver something like this and have it feel so fresh. It truly reinvented the zombie genre in a very stylish way. Class A film making in my opinion.",28 Days Later...

302,GHCool,"Great film, but similar to SALVATION",10,30 June 2003,"I think this is one of the best horror/zombie-type films I've ever seen. However, its amazing how similar this movie is to SALVATION, a short film I co-produced with Michael Lalaian and went on to win a CINE Golden Eagle (look it up on the IMDb!).  SALVATION is about a post-apocalyptic world in which ""infected"" people (in SALVATION they're called ""Shadow Walkers"" and they are caused by radiation ... not disease) have killed the families of two lonely young people who decide to stick together and face the world. All four of the protagonists are VERY similar to the protagonists of SALVATION and so is the plot. Many key conversations and situations come directly out of SALVATION.Despite my jealousy that Danny Boyle got his film produced and distributed before I could produce and distribute SALVATION at feature length, I thought Danny Boyle, the director, was very clever at using limited resources to create a profound statement on human nature.  All of the actors did a pretty good job too, but Naomie Harris and Brendan Gleason's performances were especially noteworthy.  Its also a pretty scary film.

I must admit I got a little needled by the hysteria, and the loudness: horror is at its best when it is under-, rather than over-, stated. And unfortunately there is nothing subtle about this film; it is grossly over-the-top at every turn.This film is an assault on one's tolerance, yet the DVD extras show that the writers and director have thought about their topic.With Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris(both good).

This is a British film with a relatively unknown cast for those of us stateside. I'm fond of two of the actors, Cillian Murphy, and Brendan Gleeson. Murphy is the lead in Peaky Blinders on Netflix and Gleeson is the lead on the more recent Stephen King adaptation, Mr. Mercedes, on the Audience Network.

This movie actually has depth, while retaining and entertaining characteristic.  Not to say it's not flawed, but it's really good.  I'm not one to usually go for zombie flicks, but this film didn't try to even focus on them.  Much of it deals with a world where there is NO ONE (zombie or human).  AND just when you think zombies are the 'real' danger; ***spoiler*** (slightly) here comes the military.  NOW who's the monster here???  Very well done on creating monsters to take a look at humanity's darker side.All the performances were quite realistic, and when there was fear it wasn't mindless histaria like you'd see in MOST zombie (or other horror) films.  It was the real kind of fear that spurs us to fight for survival.  As opposed to sitting and screeching without any action.  I especially thought that the actor who played 'dad' did really well.  And Seleena's actress.If you want to know what might happen if zombies were thrust into the 'real' world, this is the movie to see.ALSO, I like ALL the endings portrayed on the DVD.  The mind of this movie's creator seems to still have that edge (having seen Trainspotting) I know feel compelled to see other of his films.

And I did like the 'global' twist towards the end.  The zombie/""infected"" make-up & special effects are fine.Negatives: the deserted London scenes weren't as eerie as I'd expected (if you've ever done a milk or paper-round, you'll have seen the same). Outrageous product placement ALL THE TIME.  Given the choice of any vehicle you like, would you choose that!?  Slightly feminist (extremely negative) take on human/male nature towards the end, which could have been balanced better.Not a bad film, but not what I was after.

308,hazysistersunshine33,I love zombie movies and this one definitely met with my approval.,7,29 September 2014,"28 DAY LATER I love zombie movies and this one definitely met with my approval. Cillian Murphy wakes up in an empty hospital after suffering an auto accident. I know you've seen these types of scenes before in movie where the main character wakes up in a desolate world and you need to find out what happened when they were unconscious. It's sad and creepy and chilling. The TV show Walking Dead, I am sure borrowed from this movie and that's OK. They are both still well written and very entertaining. This disease called Rage gets lose after a monkey attacks some scientists and desolates the world population pretty quickly. It takes place in England, but you assume it's the whole world that's effected. It revolves around four people who come together to find sanctuary somewhere from the walking, or in this case sprinting dead. These aren't your Night of the Living dead slow type zombies. They are fast, violent, strong and very destructive. It only takes a drop of blood in your eye to get it. That's how contagious it is. Of course, as in most zombie movies, you find out the real enemy is us. Unlike the dead, we are self-aware and still capable of horrible things. I know the zombie genre can be limited in what they can do and this one is no exception. It has to borrow from a lot of other stuff too, but I still recommend it.",28 Days Later...
309,padiyark,A good risk on a combo of genres,8,6 July 2003,"I heard a lot about this film, and the previews looked interesting, so I decided to give it a try over T3 and the other summer films.  Overall, it reminded me a lot of ""From Dusk to Dawn"":  a combination of genres in a so-called horror film.  BUT...I respect Danny Boyle for some of the risks he takes in cinema (at least, when it's not a commercial film he's doing).  First, the use of digital video gives the film a feel of authenticity, a la ""Blair Witch Project"". Second, the one thing I really loved in this film was the opening sequence with the main character walking through an empty London.  How they did it is beyond me; heck, I really don't want to know-that's real movie magic. Third, rock music seems to be the atmosphere-setter in Boyle's films, and once again, he utilizes songs well to set an atmosphere.  Finally, combining a survival film with a road trip film and a zombie flick is tough, but Boyle does manage to narrate the film well.  Furthermore, he directs a cast of no-names with good command; their interactions are believeable (for the most part).Yes, the zombie theory is more believeable in this film (when compared to others).  There were a few times when it felt like the acting was ""pushed"". For me, though, what could have made the movie better was a few cuts during the road trip segment and during the 3rd act of the movie.  Otherwise, a definite recommendation, especiallly over films in the summer of 2003 like ""Legally Blonde 2"", ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and ""Charlie's Angels 2"".",28 Days Later...
310,mrspasm,Scary dary.,8,21 July 2009,"It is a well known fact that I actually had my own draft of this movie written before Danny Boy decided to make it. It was about 5 years (or 1825 days to keep with the mood of the review) before this film was made that I had a dream. Actually a nightmare. There are some differences, and some similarities. His is set in present day, mine seemed to be set in a near future. In mine an experiment with chimps led to a deadly virus which turned humans into bloodthirsty rage fulled monsters. And these creatures had red eyes. Very similar, eh? Well, my creatures could shoot fire from their mouths, lasers from their eyes, and vomit acid. And also in mine, some of the creatures began to evolve, remember how to speak, and remember their past lives. In fact the only thing which gave them away was their eyes, so they all started to wear shades to cover the redness. There was a shock ending also, which I will not reveal. Anyway, I was surprised when I saw the trailer for this and though hey! They've nicked my idea! But obviously these are just coincidences and no-one ever read my script anyway. I thought it looked good and as I'd liked Boy's earlier effort Gravespotting I thought I'd give it a go.Thebest thing is this; my dream was primarily about man's self destructive nature, and how abusing our forefathers (chimps) like many people in the world now do will only lead to chaos. Boy's film also shows this. I have seen a disturbing trend recently in movies which try to show that monkeys spread disease, that monkeys kill people, or that they are idiots. None of these are true. Monkeys are the best, most intelligent creatures on out planet and we should revere them. Sure in the future they're probably going to be our masters but that is all the more reason to love them now so that they befriend, rather than enslave us. Ha ha, only joking. That was a reference to another terrible film which portrays monkeys as evil. I want to see more films which show primates (that's the scientific term) as benevolent, harmless, peaceful, fun-loving dudes.The world would be a better place if we all monkeyed about a bit more. Spiders on the other hand are the spawn of Satan, and must be crushed on sight.This film has some scareful bits, and a few excitement moments where you're not sure whether to scream or not. The bit where the monsters are chasing the fools through the tunnel and the bit where Silly-Ann Murphy is walking round London by himself. He should have just went to Harrods and McDonalds and made out like bandits. He wakes to find the world is empty, Day of The Tulips style, but eventually is chased by the creatures. He meets up with a small group of survivors who explain what's going on, and they try to travel to Glasgow where there are other survivors, and better runways to escape on a plane from. They meet evil army men, they fight with the creatures, and generally have an exciting time. It's not the best horror film I've seen, but considering how awesome horror films are these days it really needed more scary bits and killings. However, as I am usually too scared by horror movies I though this was just right.Best Scene: When Murray is exploring Olde London Town and he looks into a car window- BOOM! A dead body falls by the window inside the car. Everyone jumped at that in my house!",28 Days Later...

They just go simply mad of rage after catching the virus. Still, 28 Days Later has the sweet echoes of Romero's The Living Dead trilogy without actually ripping anything off.Cillian who? I had never heard of this guy before, but after this movie hit me so hard, I will certainly be sitting in the audience of ""Batman 5"" (not that I wouldn't be there anyways).

312,freydis-e,Run of the mill zombie flick.,4,10 June 2007,"British attempt at a 'scientific' zombie flick. A virus takes '10-15 seconds' to transform victims into raging biting speeded-up zombies. There's nothing original here, the plot never quite makes sense, and the actions of the standard group of survivors never come close: at one point they destroy the zombies with Molotov cocktails and a triggered explosion which takes out a city block, a bit later they have only a machete and a baseball bat and they never bother to even look for more effective weapons. But the whole thing is reasonably staged and reasonably acted. Minor spoilers follow.This is an OK piece of mindless entertainment  apart from the treatment of the female lead, who starts the movie as a tough, resourceful survivor, efficiently killing an infected companion before he can become a threat. By the end she has unaccountably become a frightened girlie, making no resistance as she's dragged around by a nasty man, just waiting for a (previously feeble) nicer one to rescue her. There's nothing new in reducing strong female characters to props for some hero-type's emerging macho-linity, but the message here is: when society breaks down (as it so often does in so many parts of the world) forget being tough and resourceful, girls, go find a man to protect you. Outdated, hard to take and just very silly.",28 Days Later...
313,TelevisionJunkie,Fantastic film that was wrongly promoted,10,12 July 2003,"This is certainly not George Romero's idea of a zombie flick! Nor is it truly a zombie flick... If I had to compare it to anything, the only thing I could compare it to is ""Stephen King's The Stand,"" with less characters. Although the plot makes it sound something like ""Twelve Monkeys,"" it doesn't really fit that mold either. It seems that FOX didn't know how to promote this, so they likened it to zombie flicks and the Exorcist! If that's what you're looking for, find another film in your local listings..... Or if you're so homophobic that you can't stand to see a naked man for a couple minutes, again avoid. Not only was there another comment on the ""dong factor,"" but 3 people walked out mere minutes after the opening scene, where the lead wakes up nude in a hospital bed. Yeah, it was flopping free for a few minutes as he regained consciousness, but it's not like there was a male nurse there performing fellatio on him, so gimme a break....The premise of the film is truly frightening, more-so because it seems plausible. A virus called ""the rage,"" I believe, is set loose upon society when some well-meaning animal activists break into a testing lab to release some caged monkeys. And 28 days later, the fast-spreading virus has taken over the majority of the population, turning them into zombie-like animals. Our heroes are the few scant survivors who are just fighting to stay alive. But that's not easy in a world turned on its ear....At times the film does seem slow and overlong, not that it's necessarily a bad thing, but it's called character development -- something that's missing from more movies in recent years than I can count. The performances are all great, and lead to a few real heart-wrenching and gut-wrenching moments. However, there's more scares from the reality of their situation than actual on-screen scares. Not that the film's without, there are a few truly creepy/frightening moments. You don't get too many good looks at the infected, which personally I thought made them that much scarier.  Possible minor spoiler:  The further you get into this film, the more you think ""there's no way this can have a happy ending."" But they pull it off, and not in a contrived, completely unrealistic way.  Oh, and also to comment on the gritty look of the film, while many people have complained about that, I personally thought the drab picture quality enhanced the moodiness of the piece. Taking place in post-apocalyptic times, one certainly wouldn't expect bright, vivid colors.  The combination of the look of the film and the haunting score enhance it. I couldn't imagine Hollywood taking on a project like this, but if they had, it certainly wouldn't have been as gritty -- which is a pure plus in a film like this.If you're the type who just likes the gore without having to use your brain, just remember that ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" comes out later this year!",28 Days Later...

It scratches the surface of the 'what if' scenario, and was done in an interesting way. It provides one with a new way of viewing Zombies, a new way of viewing the survival scenario and what inhumanity exists when humanity fights to exist (as is seen even most initially in the film, and then culminates later on).Overall, the film is nothing special, and if you have a boring Sunday afternoon it would be a decent way to spend it. The action sequences are decent and the film makes you think (but only a little). The plot twists become mundane as the film progresses, and the ending is too reminiscent of other films filmed in the same vein.Overall, a respectable film, but nothing truly thrilling or to be greatly distinguished.",28 Days Later...

And two, those soldiers trying to abuse the two girls, when its supposed they are for protect the world.That's a very scary message. When the world is ending, not even the ones who have to protect it can protect us. This is the right screenplay with the right director and the right performers. Cillian Murphy is amazing as Jim, the hero of the story and the real core of the tragedy. What he see, we see, and what he doesn't see, we don't see.Those first 10 very long minutes with London deserted, not a human being on the streets, no cars, just silence and devastation, are both freaking and lyrical. It shows you how it's going to be the whole movie, that the power of it's images it will be equal to the power of it's characters and plot.Is a zombie movie, yeah, but with so hyper-realistic production design that it's closer to the documentary than to the horror movie.

317,Nigel St. Buggering,A stunning setup that loses momentum,6,19 August 2003,"I find myself more than a little puzzled at all this talk that ""28 Days Later"" has reinvented the zombie film.  I would expect, at the very least, that a reinvention would bring new elements to the formula.  There's little here we haven't seen before, much of it in ""Night of the Living Dead"".But let's start with the good stuff, which, appropriately, is at the beginning.  The first act is a stunning piece of cinema.  The sight of London completely abandoned is arguably creepier and more disturbing than anything else in the film.  The cinematography employed while our hero Jim wanders empty streets searching for any sign of life is beautifully done, which is all the more amazing considering the use digital video.  Once we're finally given a glimpse of the Infected, they don't disappoint.  Scenes in which the Infected attack are brutal and harrowing; these are not the shambling, easily-outrun zombies of yesteryear.  They are quick, sometimes stealthy, and often extremely frightening.  And refreshingly, when Jim encounters survivors, they have only as much information as uninformed survivors would realistically glean from the situation.  The dialogue, as much as the surroundings, gives us a properly bleak view of their chances.Unfortunately, this promising start fails to pay off much.  The second act is filled with a great deal we've seen before in this type of film.  While it is done very well in places, it begins to feel more predictably mainstream as the movie wears on.  The maverick feel of the first act slips away, and is eventually replaced with a familiarity I found disappointing.**Spoilers ahead**On the plus side, characters ask many of the questions that audiences would ask.  Won't the Infected eventually starve to death?  How could the infection cross oceans?  Has England simply been quarantined until the plague plays itself out?  These are good moments.  However, the revelation that the survivors can be worse than the ""undead"" is something that we've seen many times before.  Granted, the dialogue here is better than usual, particularly the Sergeant's speech about ""people killing people"", but it's still all very familiar.However, it's the third act that thoroughly lost me.  The movie has given us an everyman hero, an ordinary guy lost in a hopeless situation.  Why then are we meant to believe that he is suddenly capable of becoming an unstoppable killing machine who can take on nine armed and trained military men?  I understand that we've seen the awakening of his ""killer instinct"", and that male territoriality and mating instincts have been triggered, but isn't that also true of the soldiers?  I simply found it all very difficult to swallow.  This series of events also cheats the character of Selena, who was shown to be the tough, practical survivor early on, on Whom Jim relied. In the final moments, she suddenly becomes a helpless victim, relying on Jim to come and rescue her.  I felt that the characters had become other people, only because the story required them to.Finally, the much-talked-about alternate ending.  It appears at the tail end of the credits, preceeded by the words ""what if"".  Sadly, if this ending were the one originally presented, it might come as a shock, and leave the film with a final note of surprise.  But with the first ending fresh in one's mind, it's almost impossible not to know exactly what the alternate ending is, effectively destroying any impact it might have had.**End of spoilers**In the final balance, I give ""28 Days Later"" a positive score based on its considerable early strengths.  But the pedestrian middle and the unlikely finale do bring it down.  6 out of 10.",28 Days Later...

It also has the most annoying use of a hand held camera since The Blair Witch Project. But at least that movie was supposed to look like it was shot with a camcorder. This movie also has the worse use of rapid-fire, quick-cut editing that I have ever seen in ANY movie. For example, when the zombies attack, you have absolutely no idea what is happening because the editing is so jumpy. Another problem is that this is one of those horror movies where everyone acts stupid because if they didn't act stupid, there would be no suspense. Not that there actually IS any suspense.

321,shiftyeyeddog,Overrated and Underscary (is that a word?),4,5 July 2007,"Started off pretty good. Interesting, eerie, lots of potential. But by half way through, I knew disappointment was in the air. The ""infected"" are barely involved, just showing up occasionally to keep our main characters moving on to the next place. And while the ads boast ""scary as hell,"" I'd have to say it's anything but. Not one moment in this film was truly scary. As for the cast, they did okay. It's always good to see Brendan Gleeson in another role, and Christopher Eccleston, while his character was a bit lacking, did good with what he had to work with as well. The other newcomers weren't bad, but it won't be a breakthrough role for any of them. This seems to be the Blair Witch of this year. People want a good scary movie, and word-of-mouth is pushing this one, but it's mind-boggling to figure out who it is that thinks this is good. Was it a horrible movie? No. But it's nothing I'll ever care to see again. I'll take my clichéd American horror movies over this any day, thank you.As for the ""alternate ending""... What a joke.

There is much symbolism here, namely referencing anthrax, HIV, SARS, ebola, and countless other biological diseases.  I feel this movie is almost an allegorical warning.  Extremely well acted, especially by once-tomorrow-person Naomie Harris, this film does what all great movies do- provokes thought, provokes discussion.  It held me at the edge of my seat. I want to see it again.From a strict film-making standpoint, the shots are extremely well placed, the cinematography is gorgeous and very appropriate, and overall it's just a really, really beautiful film, if in a very dark, morbid way.

324,jt1999,"Oh, my God! Where the hell is Chuck, now that we need him?",2,17 July 2003,"This is a perfect example of just how far movies have deteriorated as we enter (can you believe it?) the second century of filmmaking.It also reveals how a limited director, such as Danny Boyle, can show some flair when working with a decent script and characters he understands (""Shallow Grave,"" ""Trainspotting""), but stumbles badly when coping with underdeveloped and poorly conceived material such as this dead-on-arrival, no-brainer -- a dreary, glacially paced, uninspired rehash of your standard issue, B-movie, end- of-the-world, man vs. homicidal zombies science-fiction yarn (or should I say yawn?)The filmmakers were clearly lost.  The story, such as it, concerns a young man (Irish actor Cillian Murphy) who awakens in a London hospital (naked, for unknown reasons) to find the population decimated by a deadly virus.  He teams up with a young black woman (Naomie Harris), and together they find a man  (Brendan Gleeson, the only ray of light in this dreary sky) and his daughter (Megan Burns) living in a London highrise, decorated with blinking Christmas lights (apparently these lights attract only normal humans -- not murderous, infected ones).While exchanging mundane conversation that reveals nothing interesting or profound, the foursome conveniently hear a radio broadcast which inspires them to travel north to join other survivors.  In typical B movie style, they each follow the Stupid Rule in their own way (arming themselves with knives and bats instead of guns, driving into darkened tunnels, sleeping in the open where they are vulnerable to attack, etc.) and hiss or mumble their lines in terse, often unintelligable, English-accented snarls and grunts.  Things only go downhill from there.  In fact, this somber snorefest proves not only that comedies are becoming Dumb and Dumberer, but thrillers are in serious trouble, too. Scary as hell?  You better believe it.In the good old days of Hollywood, of course, an experienced director or producer would have ripped this script apart like a backfiring jalopy. He would have broken it down, analyzed it, improved its structure, cleaned it up, replaced its bad parts, and put it back together so it ran like new.  In short, he would have made sure the damn thing was revving like a Ferrari and whistling Dixie out its tailpipe before even THINKING about exposing a frame of celluloid (or in this case, an inch of videotape).  ""What's this story about?"" a director must continually ask himself.  ""What do I want to say to people?""  And -- more importantly -- ""Is it really worth making?""  Hitchcock once turned down a project which others felt was worthy.  When asked why, Hitch responded, ""it's not necessary.""  My question, then, to Danny Boyle and everyone else involved in ""28 Days Later..."": ""Was this picture really necessary?""Movie making isn't rocket science, but it does requires a little common sense. Too often the forest is obscured by the trees during the long haul of getting a picture made.  But a good director has a vision, and he keeps it intact -- all the way down the line (""2001"" and ""Blade Runner"" are good examples.)  He or she knows exactly what he wants, and has sound answers to critical questions such as, ""What ideas am I trying to communicate""  What should the audience take with them when they leave the theater?  How will they be entertained and/o enlightened by this story?""  And perhaps most importantly -- in this era of been- there, done-that audiences -- ""What will I be giving them that they haven't already gotten a million times before?""Pretty basic questions, right?  But apparently none of them were asked during the writing of ""28 Days Later...,"" or if they were, they weren't sufficiently answered.What we basically have here is a slow-moving, empty-headed, European remake of ""I Am Legend""/""Last Man on Earth""/""Omega Man"" -- with a little of ""The Stand,"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Night of the Comet"" mixed in -- but with none of the originality, logic, insight, topicality or especially humor of those pictures.  It's being advertised as an amped-up, action-packed, ultra-violent zombie pic.  Sounds great, right?  Would that it be so.  In fact the picture is such a grim and joyless pseudo-art house bore that from the beginning I wondered if I was in the right theater.  To add insult to injury, it's simplistic, sophomoric and morally and poliyically empty as well.  As opposed to a complex, well thought- out morality tale like ""The Omega Man"" (or almost any episode of ""Star Trek"") -- where we not only sympathize with both protagonist's and antagonist's point of view but get a powerful antiwar statement, too -- there seems to be literally NOTHING on Danny Boyle's mind except leaning out at the audience and yelling, ""Boo!""  The characters have nothing on their minds but basic survivial, and the zombies are of the insane, homicidal variety -- nothing more than foaming, rabid beasts that need to be killed ASAP.John William Corrington, on the other hand, adapting Matheson's novel ""I Am Legend,"" gave the vampires of ""The Omega Man"" not only personalities and intelligence, but a believable agenda as well: as victims of modern warfare, their mission was to return to a pre-technological age, before chemical and biological weapons disfigured them -- and sometimes Mathias's arguments made more sense than Neville's.  In this way, the structure of ""Omega Man"" is exemplary: both hero (Neville) and opponent (Mathias) are well-matched, and both want the same thing: death for the other, and possession of the girl (Rosalind Cash). And of course the great Boris Sagal added his personal touch with unforgettable scenes of a lonely man quietly going mad (playing chess with his dead friend, hearing imaginary phones ringing) while trying to pretend he has a normal life couped up in his high-tech penthouse.  Heston is a master at this kind of role; he gave us another complex shell of a man in ""Planet of the Apes.""  (And don't even get me started on that piss-poor remake that Tim Burton actually passed off as a film.)To his credit, Boyle -- who never misses an opportunity to show his male actors nude (thanks a bunch, Danny) -- gives us a few good shots of deserted London. But because we care so little about our main character, and know nothing about him, these shots have virtually no impact, no point of reference. There's no point of view in this film; the directing style never really lets you know who you should root for, or why.  I wouldn't be surprised to hear one of the monkeys at the beginning of the film directed it (actually, that's not fair -- a monkey might have shown a little life).There's also a potentially nice sequence involving wild horses running free in the countryside.  This could've worked well in the hands of a good director; as it is it, the focus of the scene -- and the one memorable line -- is inexplicably given to a secondary character, Frank (Brendan Gleeson, excellent as always) -- reminding us for just a moment what this picture might've been like if Boyle had been sharp enough to give Gleeson the lead instead of Murphy.  Which brings us to one Cillian Murphy.Murphy, a young Irishman who girls probably adore, plays Jim, the young man who awakens 28 days later to find his world forever changed.  He's good- looking, and reads his lines well.  But the LAST thing you need from your lead in a picture like this is a good-looking guy who reads his lines well!  You need personality, you need complexity, you need -- Chuck Heston!!  This unfortunate bit of casting was the final death knell of the movie.  Not only is the picture lackluster and moronic (Gleeson raves uncontrollably for about a minute before someone announces ""he's infected""  Yeah, no kidding!), it's saddled with a main actor so dull and ordinary that thirty years ago I doubt he would've been hired as Vincent Price's or Charlton Heston's houseboy, let alone be allowed to play their parts.  And never mind that he's a decent actor.  TONS of decent actors do small parts in A films or big parts in B films every day, and for good reason: they lack the charisma or screen presence to successfully carry a major movie. Paul Walker's a decent actor, so is Thomas Jane.  Both good-looking guys, both capable.  But neither of them have the personality of a James Dean, or a Monty Clift -- and they never will.  Hiring Brendan Gleeson was the best casting decision Boyle made on this turkey -- and then he kills him off halfway through the second act!   Arrggghh!!!To be fair, Murphy was working with a handicap -- NO PART!  No character! Nothing.  Zip!  Talk about your underwritten roles!  The only thing we learn about Jim is he was a bicycle messenger.  That's it!!  We also see his parents clutching a picture of him as a child.  But who really cares?  I don't recall hearing any weeping in the audience.  Here's a guy who's completely ordinary. There's absolutely nothing special about him -- nothing -- he's just an ordinary Joe like you or I (maybe a little better looking).  And why am I paying ten bucks to see someone as ordinary as you or I?  That's what I asked myself for 112 minutes. The other three people in the theater were probably asking the same thing.Perhaps most problematic of all is that the film relies on a confusing, almost incomprehensible editing style during the action sequences, and the same narrow-shutter strobe effect that's become popular since ""Gladiator"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (though it's used to excellent effect in those films).  It also suffers from a third act ""Lord of the Flies"" twist so hackneyed and out of place it might have been pieced together from discarded pages stuck to the bottom of a trash dumpster found outside Ed Wood's apartment about half a century ago.I realize what Boyle was going for -- he wanted to make an ""Omega Man"" /""Night of the Living Dead""/""Assault on Precinct 13"" for today's twenty-somethings who have (hopefully, God willing) never seen those great films.  And he wanted to do it using a Lars Von Trier, Dogme 95 style -- hoping this ""hip"" approach would scare the hell out of people just by virtue of it seeming real.  (Not a bad concept if it was done this way, but it wasn't.  Unlike the Hi-8 camcorder approach used on ""The Celebration,""  ""28 Days"" -- shot by the same D.P. -- uses a PAL DV Cam for an almost-film look, and uses little handheld stuff.  It might as well have been shot on film in the first place.)And, like ""Blair Witch,"" I guess the idea was that the realism would be heightened by the use of largely unknown faces.  And of course the zombies would be meaner and grosser and scarier than anything George Romero or Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi ever cooked up in their stupid films.  That was Boyle's idea, and it's a damn fine way to make a movie. Right?Wrong!  FIRST you come up with an interesting character or two, an involving story that makes sense, a resolution that resonates, a theme that carries some weight, and ideally some sort of variation or improvement, if possible, on the kind of film you're emulating (avoiding ripping off the interracial relationship from ""Omega Man"" or the waking-up-in-the-hospital-and-finding-everyone-gone scene from ""Day of the Triffids"" wouldn't be a bad idea either) -- THEN you pile on your handheld video.  Your neat-o strobe effects and your with-it machine gun editing.  Your young, hip cast and your trendy contemporary soundtrack.Got it, Danny boy?  Starting to sink in?  Or should we take it again from the top, a little slower this time?POSSIBLE SPOILER*****Still, the film is considered a hit -- though it seems to be leaving the theaters pretty quickly.  And now I understand (egad!) a new ending is about to be added.  The original, darker ending Boyle apparently wanted in the first place (but that didn't test well) is about to be shipped to 1400 theaters across the country and spliced onto the last reel -- AFTER the credit crawl!  No, that's not a joke -- this is right out of the L.A. Times.  Beginning July 25th, this copycat clunker will have a final scene added, probably something nice and uplifting -- like Selena becoming infected, then Jim killing her, then himself. Something cheery like that.  Just exactly what we need today, I figure.  Which reminds me -- anyone know where I can get a gun?",28 Days Later...
325,silentcheesedude,28 times better then some Hollywood horror films,8,23 January 2005,"Ah, zombie horror films. When I think about watching movies like the Dawn of the Dead or Resident Evil, I think of taking off my brain and leaving it in a big mason jar in the refrigerator for a few hours. I won't need them where I'm going. Let's face it. Zombie films aren't exactly fine cinema. But with 28 Days Later, that seemed to change.Our main character, Jim, wakes up in a hospital in London with no one in it. Matter of fact, when he walks outside he can't see anyone for miles. Coming out of a coma, he's a bit out of it, but soon encounters infected people that chase him, looking to eat him. Eventually he meets up with survivors from this outbreak, and learns that he should never come into contact with any fluid from an infected person (monster?), lest he too wind up like them.Rather then going towards the Dawn of the Dead type of zombie, it instead places a more real-feeling 'Rage' virus that is deadly. These people are still alive... but not really. They may as well be dead. They think only of anger, of killing and eating.And if Danny Boyle left it at that, it would be like any other Zombie movie. But he didn't. Like Trainspotting, he can take a very ordinary premise and make it franticly artistic. Feelings of despair and sadness, and the very real fear of dying are conveyed through our characters in good form, making them more believable. With a low budget, mostly unknown cast, and no special effects to speak of, 28 days successfully pulls off what could be one of the best zombie/biohazard virus type of horror film. It's well acted, and that's not supposed to happen in a movie like this.It becomes more relevant on the film's last half as to the message that is being sent: ""Who is more dangerous, the zombies, or the humans?"" A question brought up by Day of the Dead, though it is laid out much better here.Still, the movie may be a bit preachy for some, and those that do not like horror or violent images shouldn't even be anywhere near this sentence.

While having zombiedom achieved through a virus is an interesting take on the zombie genre, what wasn't so novel was how, predictably enough, the soldiers (ie, the ""bad men with guns"") are the real threat. Seems that four weeks without female contact is enough to turn these British soldiers into thuggish brutes hell-bent on raping the first women that come across their paths, namely, the film's heroines.There were a few tense moments and some bits that made me jump, but for the most part, the over-indulgent logic made this film an exercise in debunking than a trip through a hellish world of what if. And given that the Rage victims could be brought down by one good hit anywhere it hurt, one can't help but think that the problems afflicting the heroes in this film might have been rendered moot by a large shotgun or two.Silly, tepid, and overrated. Has some good effects, but those can't hide the lack of story, logic, or character development.",28 Days Later...

329,elu5iv3,A zombie classic,8,22 September 2003,"28 Days Later: 8/10This was one innovative movie. Made in England, this documents a sort of post-apocolypse nation after a virus that turns people into virtual savage animals or zombies breaks out. The country is largely evacuated, but one man wakes up in hospital. We then get one of the most ""WOW"" scenes in cinema history, when he walks around an EMPTY London. DEAD silence, the sort you can never really hear. He basically tours the city and it's sights... and then runs into the first zombie. And boy, does the movie get creepy after that. He hooks up with some fellow survivors, and the attempt to not eradicate the virus, but to not catch it, begins. Surreal moment of the movie for me was, from a distance (as they didn't go there), seeing my city of birth and upbringing, Manchester, in flames. The acting isn't really great, but the concept and whole intrigue of the plot really compensates for any shortcomings in that department. Not as much fighting as I expected, but never boring. This is definitely the first true ""zombie"" classic of the 21st century, and worth seeing AT LEAST once.",28 Days Later...
330,BigBadaBruce,3 Years Later,8,1 May 2005,"It's been three years since I first saw 28 Days Later and still get the creeps over this movie. It has plausibility and has great elements of psychological horror. Cillian Murphey is good as the hero, someone who wakes up to a world where a disease has taken over the majority of people living in the United Kingdom.My favourite is actually Christopher Eccleston, who is actually extremely creepy in this film. The third act has hints of Freudian techniques with mans need for females in a harrowing scene which almost includes a 14 year old girl being forced to have sex.The end is a bit flat compared to the rest of the movie but is kind acceptable as the end of a roller-coaster ride that is this movie. A lot better for a horror than half the movies out there.""A powerful virus escapes from a British research facility. Transmitted in a drop of blood and devastating within seconds, the virus locks those infected into a permanent state of murderous rage.

The movie started good and the idea of the ""rage virus"" is good.  When the guy woke up and was all alone, it was interesting.  But then I think the filmmakers must have realized they were failing to follow the tried and true and oft repeated so went with a substandard telling of the zombies and last men on earth storyline.  Even the encounter with the troops was tired and predictable from the start.

Well, at least not at first. A virus called ""Rage"" was released after a group of people set chimps in a lab free, unaware that the primates had a disease more fatal and horrifying than any other. After one bite, one scratch, one drop of blood, a person is infected and within seconds becomes a deranged, outraged monster that only knows one thing- to attack.Danny Boyle keeps the action and the pacing frightening and totally believable in this British apocalyptic thriller. Cillian Murphy is intriguing as Jim, who befriends Selena, a woman who survived the initial outbreak. Together they find more survivors and must stay alive on their journey to a military base where they can only hope there is anybody alive- that is, without the infection.The zombies are fast and truly scary, with some great gore effects and the movie ties together nicely for a really satisfying climax.

It's basically just another zombie film.However, it has some interesting twists. Instead of seeing the same old, same old, they twist it up a bit. The infected has involuntary muscle spasms, and will be running around like maniacs at the sight of ""prey"". There's no reasoning with these. There is no tying them up and teaching them meaning to life. Not here. And that's a slight beauty of it.I can most certainly say, though, that it's sequel, ""28 Weeks Later"" is far, far better. There's much more action, much more drama, and a lot more horror.

I started with high hopes, based on good reviews, but it all began to fall apart within the first few minutes, with Cillian Murphy wandering through an empty London in silly green pyjamas, shouting ""hello"". And it went rapidly downhill after that. The earlier London scenes were splattered with inconsistencies, such as bodies and warning notices everywhere, although both had been conspicuously absent during Murphy's initial bewildered stroll through London.The later scenes, with brutal squaddies in a stately home near Manchester, got even sillier, descending to the absurdities of the two females in ball gowns, while Murphy, bare-chested, turns super-hero. The final scene, echoing the early ""hello"", must be one of the most pathetic endings in British cinema - I'm just surprised I stayed with the movie long enough for this final disappointment.",28 Days Later...
336,guskeller,Few weaknesses and key strengths,8,5 October 2021,"The zombie genre has been beaten to death yet 28 Days Later stands out for being something more. The story's unique strength is its narrow scope. It follows just a few characters in mostly quiet, scavenging situations. This reserved use of zombies gives their appearances more impact while allowing time for character building. Meanwhile, the thematic focus on human evils creates a more relatable message about normalized violence. This solid narrative is enhanced by a strong cast, most of whom bring dynamic performances (particularly Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Cillian Murphy).However, the filmmaking is the true highlight of 28 Days Later. Danny Boyle is one of the better directors of his generation and this film exemplifies that. Use of Dutch angles, image composition, shadows, and gritty film quality all contribute to artistic cinematography and a distinct mood. Additionally, the editing is explosive because it builds tension with well-timed intercutting and strikes a stylish tone with a sequence of smash cuts towards the end. Overall, 28 Days Later is a film with few weakness and key strengths that boost it to a superior level.Writing: 8/10

337,L_Miller,"The less you know, the more you'll like...",7,7 July 2003,"I think the key to this movie is to avoid the relentless publicity, previews and all the interviews. It's more effective if you sort of just ride with it from moment to moment. The DV camera work is initially offputting and sometimes a little forced but if saving $$ (sorry, don't have a sign for pounds) by shooting on DV allowed those awesome initial shots of empty London it was money well saved. The setting of England helped the horror because not everybody's got a gat under the bed, so if it's you and your baseball bat (instead of you and your NRA-issued submachine gun) against five screaming freaks that raises the stakes for you somewhat. Lack of CGI infestation means that the visuals are more personal than they would be with Digital Domain's painted-in armies of the dead. I think horror, especially this kind, is better that way. Some half-turns and questionable moves from the characters, esp. Jim (let me see, I'll throw down this Bullpup battle rifle for a more effective weapon...a bat! Yes! -That- will be a good upgrade!). I don't think I can put this in the upper pantheon of ""they're coming for you"" flicks but it's serviceable entertainment. Owes a lot more to ""The Omega Man"" and ""The Stand"" than the Romero trilogy but suffers from a forced upbeat ending. Boyle certainly hasn't been a storytelling optimist in past movies, so I gotta think this is a personal declaration on his part or pressure from the suits to make a ""movie about people"" (I guess that's as opposed to a movie about plate tectonics or oranges, which we all know are very popular.)Not horrible, not upper-echelon. The kind of thing you'll like if you like that kind of thing.",28 Days Later...
338,Big S-2,"Memorable, edge-of-the-seat stuff",8,2 June 2003,"I bought this movie a couple of weeks ago on DVD. Last night I sat down to watch it and it blew me away. One of the best sci-fi / horror movies I've ever seen, and when set alongside more than a few so-called Hollywood blockbusters, provides ample proof that `bigger' isn't necessarily `better'. A lot of other pundits on this page have pointed out the obvious parallels with other post-apocalyptic and `zombie' movies, but so far no-one has mentioned the superb and unfortunately rarely-shown, never-released-on-video 1970 film `No Blade Of Grass' which also depicts a `post-apocalyptic' Britain. Anyone who's seen that movie will know what I'm talking about.One thing that I liked about `28 Days Later' were the haunting scenes of a dead London. I love `dead city' scenes in my post-apocalypse movies, it is after all what it's all about! Here, this was apparently achieved by a clever mixture of computer effects wizardry and the good old-fashioned method of literally shutting down sections of the city (and also of the M1 motorway) for short spells at `quiet' periods very early in the morning to allow the requisite footage to be filmed. And the results are stunning. The scene of central character Jim standing on the bridge next to the Houses of Parliament in a completely deserted London is (for me anyway) up there on a par with Chuck Heston coming across the ruins of the Statue of Liberty at the end of the original `Planet Of The Apes' movie. The whole movie had me on the edge of my seat from start to end. The characters are strong, the story moves along at a decent pace and the acting by all those involved is superb. The `Infected' were seriously scary too, although I would have liked to have seen more of them in close-up, rather than so much fast-cut camerawork which unfortunately seems to be all the rage among movie-makers these days and can in some cases be quite headache-inducing. The only (minor) beef that I have with the story is that it was never explained why (apparently) millions died from the virus, yet (apparently) millions of others simply became red-eyed crazies out for blood.The ending was also nicely up-beat, in contrast to the rest of the film (see the deleted scenes on the DVD extras for the much more down-beat alternative ending!). The vintage Hawker Hunter jet (with indiscernable markings) flying across the Lake District at the end was perhaps the one thing that really did betray the project's modest budget  obviously a state-of-the art RAF Tornado, a USAF F-16 or something similar would have been too expensive, as a result of which the makers had to resort to hiring a museum-piece 1950s fighter jet which resides (in real life) at Blackpool Airport! But that's a very minor quibble about an absolutely superb piece of BRITISH film-making that deserves to go down in history as a classic of its genre. Nine out of Ten!",28 Days Later...
339,TheUnseenMovieLover,"A Horrifying, Relevant and Masterful Horror Feast",8,16 May 2008,"Let me first say that 28 Days Later is not for everyone. This film shows, right from its chilling opening sequence, that you should have a reasonably strong stomach for what is about to come. This film has a considerable amount of blood and gore. But, unlike other gory horror films, 28 Days Later isn't using the blood to power the story. Instead, this film is using it to enhance the story.28 Days Later is one hell of a horror movie. Not only does it have the quintessential ingredients for a successful horror movie (intense atmosphere, nail-biting suspense, sympathetic characters etc) but it also throws in several other advantages, such as compelling direction, confident performances and a genuinely scary and clever script, which squeeze all of the terror out of even the quietest scene. From the word go, this film just doesn't let up.A bicycle courier named Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a deserted hospital. Upon further investigation, he discovers that the situation is the same throughout the whole city of London, and he soon discovers why. Upon being rescued from strange, rampaging people by survivors Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley), it is revealed that a deadly virus has been unleashed. How far it has spread is unknown, but a certain fact is that anyone who is infected transforms into a snarling, ravenous monster craving human blood. Upon the way to safety, the survivors encounter a father and daughter (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns). Together, they trek across the country in an attempt to escape from an horrific fate. Undoubtedly, the film's biggest achievement is the way in which it accomplishes the huge feat of making us believe that large cities such as London have really been deserted (well, mostly). The gritty and realistic way in which the filmmakers complete this task is both powerful and iconic, and is likely to be the thing that people remember most fondly after watching this movie.As with any horror film, the force which threatens the characters should be starkly terrifying if the film is to truly make us wonder who will survive the ordeal, and 28 Days Later has a hell of a threat on display; a highly contagious and uncontrollable virus. Once someone has been infected, there is no hiding it, like if a film character was bitten by a zombie. That person has from 10 to 20 seconds before they become a blood-thirsty, rampaging monster, not quite a zombie but entirely devoid of human instincts and rationality. These guys are fast, nasty and utterly horrific.The actors are excellent throughout the entire course of the film. They are given terrific material here, and all of the cast sink their teeth into it. Even the smaller characters, such as Noah Huntley's doomed survivor, are given moments of such character-defining brilliance that we immediately come to care about them and their fate.As the film's lead character, Cillian Murphy carefully constructs a journey from a humane presence to hard-edged hero, whereas Naomie Harris takes the audience on the opposite journey. Both actors accomplish their separate stories with excellent humanity, vulnerability and grit. As the father and daughter in the middle of the crisis, Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns are both superb, creating a believable bond between the two characters which is at times extremely powerful. A gut-wrenching moment when Gleeson's character is struggling to say goodbye to his daughter is both incredibly poignant and grippingly urgent, and it is absolutely devastating to watch. And finally, Christopher Eccleston brings a sense of flawed yet understandable humanity to Major Henry West, a soldier whose ideas about surviving the virus are almost as sinister as the Infected themselves. Many of the actors in this film have since gone on to star in major franchises (Batman, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean etc). Based on the incredible strength of their performances here, it's not difficult to see why.Danny Boyle provides terrific direction. He ensures that the thrills and chills on display rarely ever let up, and creates several harrowing highlights. Some of the prime examples are the opening scene, a tremendously gripping sequence in which the group race to change a tyre as the Infected approach and a bloody one-man stand between Jim (Murphy) and a group of men who are holding Selena (Harris) and Hannah (Burns) hostage. However, he also provides moments of superb characterisation (a disturbing moment when Jim encounters an Infected boy shows how far the character has progressed) and moments of eerie calm (an all-out shopping spree through a deserted shop is quietly chilling).The production is also helped immensely by an intelligent script, which asks serious questions about the nature of human rage. Indeed, in the climactic house raid, Jim is becoming what he has been fighting to survive against, in an attempt to save others. This is a horrifying moment when the writers and Boyle are delving into the central idea of the storyline, rather than shying from it like other horror films. Also, the film offers a realistically powerful view on how different humans may react in such a horrifyingly hopeless situation, creating a smartly grim view on the proceedings. There is also some clever social commentary here. One character comments on how ironic it is to need rain so badly in England, while it is a genuine shock to see London in such a barren, deserted state.Overall, 28 Days Later is a thrilling, chilling and thoughtful look at how humanity can survive in the face of great peril. I admit that the ending wasn't as strong as it could have been, but neither was it as weak as it could have been. I was thoroughly gripped by this film, and even though I am not the world's biggest horror fan, I am not willing to let that get in the way of me recognising a great film when I see one.",28 Days Later...
340,michaeljharvey,"Strangely enough, a stylish and beautiful zombie film",9,18 January 2009,"28 Days Later is not based on a stunningly original premise. A virus breaks out, it turns people into bloodthirsty ""zombies"", and we quickly have an end-of-the-world scenario on our hands. A band of survivors must go on a dangerous road trip, hoping to find salvation. Anyone who has watched a few horror or sci-fi movies has certainly seen something similar.However, what sets this movie apart is the brilliant direction of Danny Boyle and absolutely amazing cinematography and camera work. The lighting of every scene is beautifully considered. There isn't one amateurish shot that breaks the dark, somber mood of the film. The camera is almost always put at an unexpected angle or in an unusual position, making even the most mundane scene seem special. Every filming location is perfectly considered, from inner-city London to the British countryside. Even the eccentric soundtrack helps to accent this wonderfully atmospheric film.The characters and plot are fairly simplistic, but they work well here. Some overarching themes of mankind's need for hope and humanity's dark nature are explored, which does help to add a little meat to the rather basic story. It's strange to say, but this is an artistic and thoughtful zombie film. Horror fans expecting the traditional cheap tactics (gore, female nudity, jump scares, etc...) should avoid at all costs. This is a stylish horror film that transcends the genre to become a modern classic.",28 Days Later...

Not great, but worth seeing.",6,5 July 2003,"*Slight Spoilers*I love zombie movies so there was no way to see 28 Days Later without a predisposition created by Romero's ""Dead"" series and various others.  As I watched the movie I felt disappointed at times and satisfied at others.Perhaps I shouldn't really call this a zombie movie.  The creatures are humans, very much alive, but infected by a virus.  There is none of the relentless, pressing sense of doom that Romero's shuffling, never-tiring zombies gave us.  But, there are frenetic bursts of adrenaline.  These creatures move *fast* when they attack.The camera work with the creatures was good.  Most sightings are in the periphery.  Blurred shadows and fast-motion effect captures.  Since the attacks tended to punctuate long periods of quiet movie, they were pretty jarring.The movie was uneven at the end.  I didn't like the military group turning out to be so evil.  Not that military groups can't be evil, but I felt that the movie needed to focus on *one* enemy.  Switching gears like that near the end diffused the focus.I did, however, like the revelation (?) about exactly how widespread the contagion was.  That simultaneously made me feel a deeper despair for the characters and a renewed hope for their chances.The characters themselves are well portrayed.  I like the man of quiet strength, the tough woman, the young girl having to grow up to quickly, etc. These are all stock characters but well done.6.5 out of 10.",28 Days Later...

345,PippinInOz,Brilliant film of many layers......,10,20 September 2011,"As I've admitted before: I do like a dystopian end of the world narrative. Some films of this genre are fantastic, others dire, but this one, well.......Just viewed this again for the umpteenth time after waiting a few years since the last I watched it.I'll cut to the chase: if you have not seen this before and are looking for a fast, at times nerve wracking experience complete with believable lead protagonists, then give it a go. Okay, as the message says SPOILERS ALERT.Cutting to the Chase: This film never ever lets up. However, rather than the unwatchable smash bang wallop of films like 2012 (yes, I detested this) this is how it is done. Each scene links on to yet more fear and horror, all the time introducing little facets of the major characters' personalities and just how they are transforming themselves in a bid to survive a world where most of the population are 'infected' with rage. I have always thought that what makes particular horror / dystopian stories WORK is our investment in the people trying to survive. The more realistic they are, the more we engage with them. The 'infected' move like lightning, adding to the fear and loathing that permeates this film. The editing is effective and you feel, with the characters, that you are on edge, looking over your shoulderJim: 'Everyman' - one of the most effective - and affecting - decisions of the film makers here, is to make their lead character so unlike a gung ho hero in waiting. Jim is sensitive, scared and at a loss. It is no mere coincidence that the very first shots of the film reveal a monkey pinned down by scientists on a bed, the first time we see Jim, the shot is mirrored. As we see Jim 'pinned' down with the wires and paraphernalia of the modern hospital intensive care unit. I feel the audience is positioned with Jim, he is 'us' if you like. His journey and transformation sees him change (like the monkey on the hospital bed) from sensitive, scared man to a man infected by RAGE - he doesn't catch the disease of the blood, but his actions towards the end when he 'rescues' the two women (Selena and the young girl) see him behaving in an almost identical way to the infected. The knowing look from the infected black army fella, who has been kept tied up 'to be watched' when Jim sets him free, suggests a kind of understanding. His journey from gentle bloke ('Hello? Hello?') to a man who has to kill an infected child, to a man who can dig his fingers into someone's eyes, is terrifying. When he wakes up in the cottage at the end, he has already had a premonition of the place earlier in the film (blink and you'll miss it), but in the premonition the word 'Hello' says 'Hell'- so the ending is not without its disturbing echoes. The end is a mirror of the beginning. Jim waking up after being seriously hurt - and surviving. The ending is so ambiguous, while on the one hand the 'infected' are dying, that faceless helicopter, after the army guys we meet earlier in the film, suggests threat and danger as much as rescue. Look, if you want to watch this as pure entertainment, you can. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a film that is layered and keeps revealing more each time you watch it, or you want a good film to write an essay on, this is your film. Well worth repeat viewings, get the pause button ready. Some of the scenes are just so powerful and revealing. Yes, I love this film!",28 Days Later...

347,Unicorn-9,A Life Less Zombie-Filled,3,19 October 2003,"I liked the first twenty minutes or so of this movie: in particular, the various scenes of an empty London were well done, though I must admit that even by that point I'd drifted away from the story enough to spend most of those scenes wondering how they'd shot them.After that, though, it all went downhill.The main problem I had, other than the confused script that couldn't really decide whether it was a zombie movie or a weak road movie that just happened to include zombies (even though there seemed to be obvious 'homages' to many of the most famous movies of the zombie genre) was that the characters were dumb and caused many of their own problems, leaving me with little sympathy for them. Oh, and the teenage girl wasn't exactly the strongest of actors either.SPOILERS: First, when faced with zombies carrying a disease that's contagious from contact with a small amount of blood, what do our heroes do? Well, the character who's determined to survive at all costs chops them up with a machete, just to make sure that the blood goes everywhere. Then when they have the choice between taking a tunnel under the Thames or crossing on a bridge, they take the tunnel and, surprise, surprise, nasty things are waiting down there. Then one of them catches the disease by being stupid. Then later when one of them is being chased by a group of soldiers, the soldiers totally forget even the most basic military discipline and let him pick them off one by one. The only other decent parts of the movie were the rats and the scene where the soldiers were fighting off a zombie attack in the night. More of that, less stupid people doing stupid things, and a decent ending, and it would have been worth watching.NO MORE SPOILERS: So, while this might have made an OK TV movie in the British post-apocalyptic tradition, I really don't think it was up for theatrical release... and, while they did a decent job of the cinematography considering the cost of the camera they shot it on, I'm certainly glad I didn't have to watch the low-res digital video images in a cinema.

The premise has already been described to death, but I have to wonder - in the reviews I read (not all 400+), no one has mentioned ""The Day of the Triffids"" as a possible source of inspiration for this film (not the movie, the book). After all, it's both British and post-apocalyptic, and addresses (in more detail - after all, it's a book) many of the same social questions that this movie touches on. OK, so there are directly-correlating scenes between this and Dawn of the Dead (shopping), Day of the Dead (intra-group strife, and captured zombies), and a variety of other movies. It's still really well done and has the oddly-scary ""grainy-o-vision"" appearance of movies like ""Make them Die Slowly/Cannibal Ferox"" which was made in the 70s and looked like a honest-to-goodness snuff film. (I actually went to the theatre staff and asked if there was a problem with the focus...)Don't watch this looking for a slick zombie-fest like Resident Evil. I loved RE, but it was action-based, and this movie isn't - it's very much rooted in character, drama, and despair.What's not scary about being one of the last people left alive in a world inhabited by infected creatures who only come out at night and want to kill anything that moves?",28 Days Later...

With that being said 28 Days Later is neither.  I came away feeling like I just sat through a social commentary on AIDS or some other contagious disease.  Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with that, but I was expecting hardcore zombie action.  The trailers had led me to believe I was gonna get something else.  A few scenes showed alot of promise, but overall the movie was a letdown.  If you saw the trailer of tv commercials, you saw the movie.

352,AW_McGOWAN,"Last Of The ""Real"" Zombie Movies",8,28 November 2020,"Upon its release in 2002, ""28 Days Later"" made lots of noise as critics called it the scariest film since ""The Exorcist."" Indeed, the movie is quite terrifying. While zombie movies have since edged further towards the action-adventure genre, ""28 Days"" remains unambiguous horror.Director Danny Boyle creates this horrific energy through practical effects that strengthen a suspenseful atmosphere. One of the main ways that zombie movies have transitioned from horror to action in the 21st Century is the increased use of CGI. Nowadays, most on-screen zombies are depicted in massified, computer generated armies. ""28 Days Later"" might be the last time that such infected antagonists look truly real - simply because they are actual actors dressed in decrepit makeup and dowsed in fake blood, moving jerkily against shaky frames for an unnerving effect.The movie furthers this authentic energy through its sets. Like the zombies themselves, the deserted worlds in today's post-apocalyptic movies usually appear digital. ""28 Days Later,"" however, was clearly shot on actual locations. The crew even emptied out massive parts of London to create a post-exodus city. This faithful depiction of a humanless planet makes it all the more believable and therefore eerie.In other instances, the practical sets take the story to more intimate places. Dark hallways, abandoned buildings, and creepy hideouts all render the characters and viewers claustrophobic. Although the story's zombie-creating virus is a global phenomenon (as emphasized in the vacant London sequences) these small-scale settings reinforce the fact that there is nowhere to run.Furthermore, the zombies are not of an overly high or low mimetic. They retain their human mortality, but are unconsciously resilient in their efforts to infect. Because of this, the movie doesn't overdo its zombies, making their selected appearances of greater significance and intensity.Boyle really does offer a master-class in how to create a zombie movie here. ""28 Days"" is enthrallingly scary, visually compelling, and offers all the philosophical muses of post-apocalyptic survival without jamming them down the audience's throat. While the characters could use a little more development, they are all believable enough, and each actor pulls his or her own weight.A couple cherries on top of this movie are John Murphy's music (""In The House¬ - In A Heartbeat"" is a superb score) and its distinct Britishness. Like Robin Hardy's ""The Wicker Man,"" ""28 Days Later"" would be somehow less effective if it weren't an English production. Watching a place as developed and orderly as the UK fall into disarray is uniquely uncanny, thus adding to the fear factor.If only more films in this genre could've followed ""28 Days Later's"" lead in the past couple decades. Then, we'd have more quietly brilliant zombie movies rather than unremarkable videogame imitations that prefer action-packed extremity to subtle cinematic thrills.",28 Days Later...

Much like we learned in season 2 of TWD, other survivors became the worst threat in a post-apocalyptic world (again, would've been more intrigued by that twist had I not already seen TWD). Cinematically, the overall look of the film appears older than it is, maybe because I'm spoiled on hi-def nowadays.

356,scotty-37,"Uneven, But Interesting Horror/Suspense Movie",7,30 November 2003,"28 Days Later was a good attempt to make a horror movie that had something more interesting going on than many horror movies.  The acting works, and it's not all just one big, predictable bloodbath. Though it's enjoyable, it has a number of problems.********************* Spoilers Ahead **************************As soon as I saw Brendan Gleeson (the dad of the little girl) I suspected he was there to get killed off since he was a sympathetic character. Unfortunately I was right--and it was too bad since he was one of the more interesting characters in the movie.The tunnel scene was just ridiculous and manipulative--since there seemed to be no need to go through the easily predictable ""zombie tunnel"" when most of the streets and bridges seemed to be clean and rubble and zombie free.The ""Lord of the Flies"" military enclave seriously messed up the movie for me.  I had a hard time believing that these men had gone so sex-crazed and raving mad in only a month. It was just stretching things a bit too much for me--especially since the commanding officer was smart enough to figure out that the zombies would die after a while and all the needed to do was wait it out.In fact, the zombies were really so stupid that I had a hard time believing that more people hadn't survived.  All it would really take to survive was a good supply of food and water and a strong door to keep the zombies out until they starve.  They certainly weren't well organized or hard to outwit--even if they are faster than the old-school zombies.This movie, as flawed as it was, came off better than a lot of horror movies I've seen.  At least we didn't see anyone getting killed during a makeout scene or any of the ultra-predictable horror cliches.  I liked that they didn't show everything that happened leading up to this state (such as with a montage), and instead left things up to the imagination. I liked the space in the movie that left you on edge waiting for something to happen rather than making everything into a long, boring, predictable fight scene.  The scenes of an empty, silent London were quite cool.Overall this is an ok movie that squandered its potential to be a much better movie.",28 Days Later...

I was disappointed to discover it's mostly a collection of blurry, 70's style filmmaking revolving around some dull acting and a script that starts out good and ends up absolutely dying, no pun intended.  Unfortunately Boyle should have realized that if you're going to make a character driven (?) zombie movie you need some compelling characters.   It's the rare film that actually could have really benefited from some star power - had Boyle alum Ewan McGregor been cast as the lead it would have been infinitely more interesting.

The film focuses on a group of survivors trying to make sense of the epidemic that they are faced with.The cast is top-notch, you have Cillian Murphey (Red Eye, Batman Begins) and Naomi Harris (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest) and some other people I will fail to mention. The movie is also directed by Academy Award-winner Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire). The movie has strong performances, and some very suspenseful scenes.This is basically a more realistic version of George A. Romero's zombie series. 28 Days Later is heavily inspired by other horror classics, such as Day of the Dead (1985).

Now, could something like this happen in reality?  Sure, but not exactly how it's played out on screen.  The real horror of this story is that it strikes a nerve, and even the most jaded viewer cannot ignore the reality of the first few minutes of the film in which total panic has broken out worldwide due to this super virus.

In real life, not everyone is ""Rambo"" and it was refreshing to see the hero more helpless than helpful. As far as zombie movies goes, there's nothing really surprising. There are the usual chase/escape scenes and kill or be killed scenes. The gore is minimal, and left mostly to the imagination (which isn't a bad thing).My main complaint about the movie happens towards the latter portions of the movie where the story takes a left turn into the dregs of humanity.

Zombies are supposed to move slower than mummies and that's why they're such a potent symbol for existential dread. (IE Being trapped in the prison of a body that's ineffective and slowly rotting)Boyle forgets he's making a zombie film a couple of times throughout and seems to have focused his film on the nature of human aggression. This was done way better in his superior Di Caprio vehicle ""The Beach"" As a fan of such films as ""White Zombie"", ""Zombie"" and ""Zombie Holocaust"" (Basically anything with Zombies) I can not bless this production.

Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up one morning to find himself in a hospital bed, with no idea how he got there. He then finds that there is no one else in the hospital, and goes outside to find the streets of London literally empty. Naturally he is very worried about this, and soon wanders away and is saved from infection by Mark and Selena (Noah Huntley and Naomie Harris). These three team up and begin to go in search of a safe area, later meeting up with Hannah and her father Frank (Megan Burns and Brendan Gleeson). The troop gets lead of a military camp nearby, and set off to find some trace of what's left of civilization.28 DAYS LATER is a smart, well-done horror flick. Though the whole infected/zombie premise is pretty overdone, this movie makes it interesting again. The ""infected,"" as they are referred to, are genuinely creepy, and the sight of the completely empty streets of London in the beginning is chilling. The film creates a tense atmosphere and rarely breaks it, which is a good thing. You can feel the characters' struggle to stay alive and well and can sympathize easily at their fright.Technically, this movie is very impressive. Good acting all around from virtual unknowns, and good direction. The scenery and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking in parts, adding an ironic sense of beauty to an otherwise depleted world. The screenplay is well-written, with few cliches and little corny moments. Everything looks good.Overall, 28 DAYS LATER takes an overdone premise and instead turns it into a good movie. You get that genuine horror film feeling while still managing to have a good time. A smart little movie. 8/10.",28 Days Later...

But then when he meets the two survivers they say that the infection has started throughout the whole earth. I immediately question this because when you get infected you turn almost directly. So how are then the infection accidently taken to other partsof the world. The characters later in the movie also question this and it turns out that its only England that is affected.When the Black Girl kills her companion when she suspects he is affected by the look in his eyes, I think that is kind of stupid. She could have just waited a few seconds and she would have known.But the thing that made me dislike the movie was when they meet the military men. All that happens when they are there is boring and stupid. Firstly the men dont act like military men. They dont seem to have any training when they shoot at the zombies and dont act any professional at all. Then they seem to have lost all hope and are whiling to kill each other because of a girl. It has gone like a month since the outbreak. I have a hard time even when it seems to them that society had collapsed that they would act this desperate and strange. One last thing I remembered. When they escape from the city through the tunnel, the zombies follow them.

These two problems make this movie a totally ridiculous one, and what originally began as a tightly wound cautionary tale of the dangers and the results of scientific genetic manipulation degenerates into a remake of the Night Of The Living Dead.

Though it has been excessively advertised as a horror movie, those who get their thrill from the big scare will find horror fare too scarce in this piece.Elements of plot may have been used before, but I mentally engaged with the characters and their motivations. Except the odd occasion of walking or straying with a potential murderer round the corner.The direction was good. A little to jerky with the last act, making it a tad difficult to follow who was where and doing what. But that closeness and reality were there. Like the way you felt you could reach out and grab a handful of dirt in Saving Private Ryan.For me the humans infected with 'The Rage' where part of the setting, the environment, and not the essence of the story. People operate from a realistic point of view in this film, if you're angry you exact vengeance. It's human nature. Why do we demand punishment for our criminals? justice? reform? hardly, it's revenge. These are opinions this film is not afraid to make. However, advertising this film as horror will attract a lot of folk who care little about morality and thus will be disappointed that there is a short changing of shock. And let's face it. With this premiss we could have had 90mins of horror tension.I did feel a little cheated of 'scare', but was pleasantly surprised at the depth in what I was led to believe was the scariest horror movie of the year.PS Obvious comparisons are made to Vanilla Sky with the bare streets, but it's not about the implied meaning, more amazement that so much of London was shot abandoned, when it hums 24/7 and you can't shut any of it down to shoot.

374,BSchin2188,How NOT to make a horror film...,1,22 March 2004,"Many people say that Danny Boyle is a gifted film maker.  I will say that his directing in this movie is pretty good, and there were some good ideas. But all in all, I think that this movie would be better used as a torture method on prisoners of war.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUTThe best thing about this movie was the beginning.  The massive virus outbreak being started by environmental activists?  Pure genius.  A great touch of irony here.  Some other things that I liked were the freaky zombies, and the all around good acting.Now, for what I didn't like.  This may take a bit...My biggest complaint was the music.  During a horror movie, when the scary stuff starts to fly and the action runs high, it's typical that you play scary music.  Now, I'm all for breaking the norms in movies for something good, but playing classical/opera music during the horror scenes was a terrible idea.  I am convinced that someone forgot to take their medication when the musical score was being selected.  Not only did the director choose opera music for zombie food-fests, but it wasn't even scary opera music. Something cool and creepy like Bach's Tocatta and Fugue, D minor would have worked.  But Boyle chose to go with nice, happy classical music, thus negating any and all potential terror to be had.Next, the military men being type-casted once again as sex-craved maniacs. Sure, they disguised this stereotype with ""the need for procreation"", but the military is already seen as sex-crazed, horny people with guns.  My friends and myself all saw this turn a long way coming, and I could literally hear people in the theatre audience complaining.  One woman behind me said to her boyfriend ""What?  More horny, evil army guys?  I thought that this film was going to be something original!"".  So much for her wishes, huh?And Jim, for an average guy with no mentioned military training, was pretty good at taking out those army people.  He never missed a shot, out-foxed them all, and would put a 6-man Delta Force to shame.  Hand this guy a contract and send him to airborne school!  A naturally born special forces op, what are the odds?Well, my list of gripes is getting pretty long, so I will cut to the chase. There was no need for the poor musical selection, I saw the ""big plot twist"" coming shortly after the opening credits wrapped, and an entire military force missing one guy that just grabbed a gun and started shooting.  Save your time, and watch ""Night of the Living Dead"" instead.  Now, that's a zombie movie!",28 Days Later...
375,mkm-hermanjnr,I have a love/hate relationship with this movie.,6,4 November 2019,"28 Days Later is, for me, I strange blend of things I love in the horror genre and things I really can't stand.The basic premise is this: Jim and Selena are two survivors of a viral plague that is incredibly infectious and turns people into foaming-at-the-mouth killers. This plague has devastated Britain. They must find a way to survive.First of all, the post-apocalyptic Britain setting is right up my street. I'm slightly biased as a Brit, but I love seeing the deserted streets of my home nation's capital. The movie does a really good job of selling the feel of a world gone to ruin, even if some of the street shots are suspiciously clean and tidy (where are all the corpses?!)The mere technical achievement of shutting down blocks of London to film is in itself impressive.I'd go as far as to say the first half of the film is 10/10 fantastic, up to and including the part where the survivors meet Frank and his daughter. The characters are relatable and likeable, they behave sensibly and the innovative concept (at the time) of fast, extremely infectious ""faux-zombies"" is terrifying. Up until this point, the script is smart.Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is, for me, where we start taking a very heavy detour away from fresh post-apocalyptic survival tale into tiresome horror cliche and some very lazy writing. It feels like the backend of a worse movie was sort of welded on for the second and third act.First of all, the characters suddenly all simultaneously develop some kind of brain dysfunction and start acting stupidly, like they're in a terrible 80's teen slasher. Frank insists that they need to leave the safe, secure block of flats due to lack of food and rainfall, even though we've just seen Jim and Selena return from a convenience store that was absolutely stuffed with food and drink. Instead he wants to travel what is probably 50-100 miles to some sort of military checkpoint. Why not instead travel 1/2 a mile to the local supermarket, convenience store or neighbouring block of flats and grab more food? Everyone's dead, there should be tons left!He also complains there has been no rainfall for 10 days and says how unusual this is. This is indeed very unusual in England, so why not simply wait another day or two sipping Pepsis and get the inevitable deluge of fresh water that is surely on the way?Instead, Frank and the others decide to leave their highly effective police riot gear behind and get into a completely vulnerable taxi cab, before driving through a pitch black tunnel filled with wrecked cars, infected citizens and corpses. You read that correctly.One of the characters even comments repeatedly on how utterly idiotic this idea is, as if that somehow excuses the writers for making the characters take this ludicrous course of action that no person in their right mind would ever do. I hate it when films do this, and it's universally something that happens in really badly written scenes.Just having a character point out how utterly stupid a course of action is DOES NOT excuse you as a writer for having them do that thing. If your friend asked you to leap off a cliff, would you say ""This is an utterly stupid idea! Let's do it.""? No, of course not.While the film is ratcheting up this false tension by contorting the characters into being idiots, they begin *laughing*. Because the process of driving recklessly over ruined cars while packs of screaming lunatics chase after you, intent on gouging your eyes out is...funny?I've re-watched this scene several times and I still just can't understand what they were going for here. Maybe that sort of relief-laughter people sometimes do? But the actors seem genuinely happy, like they're laughing with boundless mirth at the prospect of their imminent agonising death. It's bizarre, and not in a good way.Frank then gets infected after randomly deciding to scream at some crows that are feasting on infected corpses. He was a great character and I think it was a mistake cutting him from the film so shortly after his first appearance. Even more annoyingly, he would have been fine if he'd been wearing his riot helmet that he had about 5 scenes ago and the blood drip would have been harmless, but the script is dropping like a rock in quality by this point so we're not supposed to think about it.The final act for me kind of ruins the rest of the film further. It's intense, the soundtrack is good and there are some interesting scenes, but the portrayal of almost all of the soldiers as lunatic rapist psychopaths is too silly for me to really maintain my suspension of disbelief.It's clear, perhaps too clear, that the intention was a ""human nature is the real evil"" kind of epilogue to the story. This was also a theme during the ""chimps watching humans being violent"" scene. But it's done so clumsily in the third act.Somehow normal people with no military or survival training are mentally competent and holding it together after 28 days in post-Infection Britain. But mentally hardened, trained soldiers with the ability to defend themselves and good friends by their side are for some reason utterly insane by this point, to the point that they're convinced they need to rape and murder their way to a new society.This is all after *28 days.* Let's not forget soldiers have fought for years in WW1 conditions, watching all their friends die, and still not experienced such a drastic slide into degenerate psychopathic madness as these guys had in less than a month.Again, with some creative scriptwriting this could have been plausible. Maybe the soldiers were rookie recruits, or they were failed soldiers awaiting court martial when they escaped during the outbreak. But it's never even touched on, even though this would have been very interesting to see addressed.And that's the story of 28 Days Later; a fantastic first act, a middling second act and then a rather disappointing, rushed and rote conclusion. It's a watchable film with some interesting social commentary, it's just a shame they got lazy with the script towards the end.6/10 for the first act alone, really.",28 Days Later...
376,MatBrewster,Good First Half,7,10 May 2005,"The zombies are fast.It's true that in Danny Boyle's 2002 film 28 Day's Later the crazed, flesh eating villains aren't technically zombies. In fact, Boyle has gone to great lengths to qualify them as humans infected with a virus known as RAGE. Yet, to this reviewer at least, the differences seem moot. In traditional zombie pictures, and in this film the creatures are mindless, they carry a real zeal for human flesh, they have a predilection for turning everyone else into their like, and they are fairly easy to kill. Whether the creatures are the living dead so to speak, or infected by an incurable virus doesn't make much of a difference. Though the zombies here, seem updated from their filmatic ancestors.These zombies are fast.Traditional zombies are a slow moving lot. Having been rotting in their own graves for untold years, their reanimated flesh is a little atrophied, causing them to move at a slow, sluggish pace. This has always been a helpful plot point for the heroes in zombie films, for they are easy to run away from. In fact, the means by which zombies generally kill their victims is through sheer numbers. Boyle has circumvented this convenience by allowing his monsters to run at normal human speeds. It is an excellent update to the genre, giving the ability for more scares.Man, I dug the first half of this movie. Well, except for the very, very beginning. The opening scene gives us the origin of RAGE, with a bunch of Clockwork Orange inspired monkeys. I've never really dug origin scenes in zombie flicks. I think it's much scarier to just have the zombies running around eating brains, without any reason for their existence. Origins, generally, just seem dumb. And here, with the infected monkeys being freed by some Green Peace types doesn't really inspire any other feelings. Though, I suspect it was another move to plant this film outside the zombie track.But after the dumb origins scene things get really good. We've got a naked guy named Jim (Cillian Murphy) hooked up to various tubes in a hospital bed. I always like it when there is a bit of male nudity in a flick, since there is always so much of the female variety. Anyways, Jim gets out of bed and wanders the streets of London. There are plenty of shots of Jim (fully clothed now) walking by big famous London monuments without another soul around. It seems London has been vacated. It is creepy and effective.In a bit, Jim clamors into a church figuring to find some sanctuary, or at least have a few questions answered. What he finds is a bunch of dead folks piled up. In a good holy crap moment, Jim says, ""Hello"" to find a couple of the dead guys not so dead and jumping up. From there until the second half of the film, it is a constant run from the zombies.The zombies really work in this film. They are fast, furious, and vicious. Jim eventually teams up with some other survivors and they set about trying to figure out what to do. Boyle really does a great job of adding tension to the film and keeping the scares up.Then the film changes.The group is rescued by a gang of all male military types, living in a compound. Turns out the military types are a bunch of psychos and the film turns from being a zombie flick into being a stranded-in-a-compound-with-a-bunch-of-psycho-military-types kind of film. To make sure we know this is no longer a zombie flick, a big group of zombies launches an attack on the compound only to be massacred with machine guns and land mines.This half of the film, I don't dig nearly as much. Zombie flicks always have trouble filling out their whole hour and a half time slot. Even with a good introduction of characters, and a slow build to zombie free-for-all there is still plenty of filler time. Here, the filmmakers seem to have decided that they might as well dump the zombies and give us some other tension filled concoction. But, there isn't really enough time to develop the military end of the story and it feels wrong.It's too bad too, because that first half was really promising.",28 Days Later...
377,DP-4,"Not Bad, Not Great",6,30 November 2003,This is a movie about a highly contagious virus that evokes a sense of uncontrollable rage in its victims causing them to kill. It also explores the violence and rage that is within all people as well as the will to survive.I liked the zombies. The makeup and directing of the zombies was fun for a while. I also liked the exploration of the difference between the zombies and the military men. That was also fun for a while.The movie moves along fairly quickly and is generally well done. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to horror/gore fans looking for a good zombie flick. 7/10.-- DP.,28 Days Later...

379,saeedahmedsasoli,Quite Good Movie,10,17 November 2020,"This film feels more like a meditation on what happens to people when they are reduced to their lowest elements. A friend of mine told me that this movie's running zombies was what inspired the zombies in the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"",but where ""Dawn of..."" was pretty much a full-throttle action/horror hybrid from about start to finish,this film plays more like a ""What if..."" movie,with less emphasis on the creatures themselves and more on the (lucky?) survivors. There are also disturbing lessons on the nature OF survival,too.When environmental terrorists attack a lab that contains diseased chimps who are infected with a ""Rage"" virus, they unwittingly let loose a plague that lays waste to England and(perhaps)the rest of society. The 28 Days later of the title cuts to a mostly abandoned London where a coma-tized bicycle courier named Jim(Cillian Murphy,effective) wakes from his stasis to find himself alone in a hospital. As he searches London for signs of life,he is rescued from raging zombies by a couple of survivalists(one of them,the lovely Naomie Harris)who he follows from place to place to keep alive. From there,he also meets a man and his daughter(Brendan Gleeson,terrific,and Megan Burns,good)and they try to find a refuge out of London-town. A recorded message of a ""paradise"" where ""salvation"" can be found is tracked by Frank(the man) on his shortwave radio.I'm not sure if 28 Days Later will be everyone's cup of tea. Some of the horror and science fiction fans out there will immediately hear of this film, see a preview or a TV ad, or even see it, and dismiss it as phooey rubble borrowed from the video-store. I can see their points of view, since I saw many similarities in Romero and some other films (the military scenes reminded me of Day of the Dead, though the chained up Zombie in this was done for more practical reasons, and the supermarket scene is a little unneeded considering the satirical reverence it had in Dawn of the Dead). But what they should understand is that Boyle isn't making a 100% original film, and no one could at this point of the genre's history. He has done, however, the most credible job he could in getting a different tone, a different setting in country, and of a different, enveloping view of the scene structures. Overall, 28 Days Later is constructed and executed like most sci-fi horror films you've ever seen, and like not many other sci-fi horror films you've ever seen combined, in a sense, for a modern audience: fascinating throughout.",28 Days Later...
380,epsilon3,Post Apocalyptic Classic,9,15 November 2003,"I felt compelled to add my opinion to the comments here as this movie is being unjustly slaughtered.It's not a zombie flick - if you're expecting 'Dawn of the Dead' you may be in for a let down. The people who are infected with Rage have a disease and don't eat human flesh. Sure, they run around in packs and attack the uninfected, but the film isn't about claustrophobia and cannibalism.It's clearly homage to Day of the Triffids (and to a certain extent The Omega Man.) There's nothing wrong with that. One of the reasons why 28 days later is being attacked here is because of people's erroneous expectations. People watch a movie trailer and think they can tell what the film is going to be like. We should learn that this isn't the case and often trailers just show the most action packed or exciting bits - I thought this was widely known! To those who were disappointed when they went to see the film because they expected an out and out thriller, maybe they should have done just a little bit of research first. This is why we have the IMDB right?
To an earlier reviewer who made a snide remark towards British films, perhaps it'd be worth considering how many films are made in Britain compared to the US, and what proportion of those are high quality. Britain doesn't have much of a film industry compared to Hollywood, but I could name lots of good movies from both countries (and lots of Turkeys.)
******************** ***SPOILERS BELOW*** ********************Those who point out holes in the plot are being a little harsh. When they drive into the tunnel, it's obvious that Frank (the driver) is suffering from a mental breakdown. Cut the guy some slack! He's just spent the last few days getting over the death of his wife (and everybody else) whilst protecting his daughter from bloodthirsty lunatics with a baseball bat and a riot shield. The guy's feeling a little crazy. Jim points out that it's a stupid idea to go underground but he's ignored.In response to another point about the way the soldiers wanted to get 'laid,' this is explained by Major West as an attempt to give the men some hope of a future life that may contain some normality (a family and children perhaps.) Clearly, this isn't what happens and the soldiers have turned into callous thugs, but there is logic here. If you were the leader of a group of isolated men in a post-apocalyptic situation, would you not state that it is important to find women and attempt to build families and save the human race from extinction? In situations of extreme stress (like wars) noble men can commit terrible acts and good intentions can be warped by desperation.If you look a little deeper into this movie, it becomes apparent that it's not about zombies at all, but rather about the perilous state of the human condition. We think we are civilised and 'good' but what happens to us when the excrement hits the fan? Does the 'goodness' evaporate away leaving only savagery?This movie seems to be saying that we turn a blind eye to the terrible things that are going on around the world because they're not happening to us. Status quo is maintained for those that live in wealthy nations, but as soon as our the rug is pulled from under us, we turn into the same people that we see brutally killing eachother on the six o'clock news. When our security is taken away, we cease to see people as individuals...they become casualty reports. Women become incubators or objects that are easy to brutalize (Bosnia anyone?) Our morals and civility are eaten away as self-preservation kicks in big time. As Jim finds out towards the end of the film, you don't need to be infected to get the rage...it's already within all of us and is waiting to come out.If this is the case, should we accept our innate violence and go with it when it's needed, or should fight against it and struggle to contain our selfish desires?All of the characters in the film (apart from the young girl) go through this moral crisis. Selena learns that survival isn't everything when it's at the expense of one's self respect, and Jim learns that violence is sometimes necessary and in some situations may be unavoidable.For those of you that have seen Straw Dogs, a similar ethical difficulty faced by the main character. Does one use violence to prevent violence?The question isn't really answered in either film. I was sickened by Jim's descent into barbarism, but wondered what I would do in his situation. Probably the same thing.....a scary thought.Lots of other questions were raised in this movie and it left me thinking for quite a while. It also left me excited and repelled by the fact that it is very violent. In response to the earlier comment, which recommended skipping the first scenes if you're watching it with children, take my advice - don't watch any of this film with kids. It contains extreme violence throughout and deals with adult themes that are definitely not for the young.To sum up, I implore you to not be put off by the negative comments about this movie that are expressed here. If you like intelligent films - this is one to try. Just don't watch it with your auntie Mable - she probably won't like it.",28 Days Later...

You find yourself caring less and less about the characters themselves, and more and more about when the next most gory death scene will occur.This is not the case with 28 Days Later.Danny Boyle, the same fellow who brought us the masterpiece Trainspotting, once again hits the nail on the head with this awesome depiction of human nature at its worst. While the ""rage virus"" is just that, a virus, one could say that there is underlying social statements in this film. An example of such is at the beginning, when the chimp is being forced to watch media coverage of riots and violent acts being committed between humans.But beyond this, when the real action begins- and this happens to be quite early on in the film- it simply does not end. There is not a single twenty-minute gap that I can think of in the film where a zombie is not seen, or where an altercation of some sort does not take place.The people killing people line, as well, was quite perfectly scripted and well-delivered.All in all, the film proved to be quite valuable on several levels.

Several pictures (Romero's Dead series, Omega Man, etc.) have discussed the exact same plot, which is some type of contagion causes people to become non-human and kill humans. There are also some obvious plot holes such as; the security at the lab was clearly inadequate for that type of virus, the reaction by armed forces would have been faster, the incubation time of the virus was so short that it couldn't spread across the world (they acknowledged that possibility), the infected did not attack each other, and the main character, Jim, would have died of thirst before waking up. All that being said, I felt that the pace was kinetic and the characters were believably human (even if there were a couple of 'YOU IDIOT!' moments).The writing was a strong point, the people discussed what would come to my mind, and the sets, direction, and camera were good.

387,Flyer78,A bright ray of originality in the otherwise repetitive zombie genre,8,11 July 2009,"28 Days Later is one of those movies that grabs your attention the instant it begins, and holds it with a tight vice grip until the end credits roll.Just the sight of London completely deserted, and the chilling silence as the main character Jim, who is played by Cillian Murphy brilliantly, is walking through the once famous city turned ghost town, is enough to really get you thinking. For a solid three minutes, all you see is Jim walking through the city and exploring the places he has come to know, which have all been completely left behind. It may not sound like anything too special, but sitting for three minutes and watching someone walk through a deserted city with complete silence around them is pretty freaky in itself.From that point on, everything unfolds at a perfect pace, and when you are introduced to the zombies of the film, which are labeled simply as ""The Infected,"" you can feel your heart pulsating in your chest, constantly alert for any moment when one of the Infected will come jumping into sight, and in many ways, it feels like you are smack in the middle of the film, staying on your toes and watching for any Infected that may come bounding recklessly towards you. And believe me, that feeling makes this film very, very fun.I don't have an awful lot to say about the acting, other than it was great, particularly Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris.To be honest, I think this film wasn't quite deserving of the R rating. In my opinion, it could have been one of those PG13's that pretty much walk the borderline, because pretty much the only things that got the big fat R slapped on this were the brutal and gory scenes (especially towards the end), plenty of F-bombs, and a few scenes containing brief nudity.But in all honesty, who cares?

There's a lot of discussion in America right now about films that portray the military in a bad light.  I say, bring 'em on!

And where does Jim get his Rambo injections?  I was so completely turned off by this diversion from the more interesting issues raised by the story itself (such as the day-by-day particulars of survival and the relationships between the principals) that I lost interest in these very unpleasant people.

He takes the offensive against the real bad guys who are other uninfected people.

396,callaway76,Pay no Attention to the Trailer,8,13 July 2003,"Preview Pre-ReviewThe first trailer I saw for this movie was the teaser, very short. It basically shows you a man waking up in a hospital to a world stripped of people, void of music or narration. Immediately the mind scatters. You become intrigues, speculative and enticed to see this Sci-Fi, Philosophical, Brit-Flick.Subsequent trailers followed frequently during my favorite television program (ironically the movie makes a joke about the Simpsons) revealing further plot to this movie and unfortunately portraying it as a Zombie genre Horror flick. I knew from the teaser that the movie was good and had to mute out the previews to keep my head from thinking this movie to be another 'Evil Dead'.I saw the movie in a local theater packed with many high school students. Many people left after 20 minutes, pairs would leave every 7 minutes there after. The trailer spoiled it for them, similar to how it spoiled me.ReviewI loved this movie! First off the camera work (what appears to be digital camcorders), though it takes getting used to, was an awesome canvas. Second the acting, well done. Similar to Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead'. It displayed true human angst for salvation after man's society has been replaced by eminent threat. The directing was superb. I have always loved 'Trainspotting', 'Life Less Ordinary' was decent and I was advised to steer clear of 'The Beach'. It was hard to associate the directing in '28DL' with any of these movies. It was definitely Danny Boyle turning over a new leaf.
Overall this movie pleasantly fused elements of Goosebump inducing story telling, Jump-out-of-your-seat Thrills, and the overly-forgotten advantages of low budget film making (the most expensive special effect was probably the red contact lenses). Together you get a thinking man's Thriller. It is not a zombie flick since technically there are no Zombies only sick, very sick, people. It reads like a novel but it grabs you like a animalistic killer. Well shot and well developed it is a completely original take on an age old idea.Even though it has a preview for ""Jason vs. Freddy"" it is not a slasher movie nor your run-of-the mill Horror movie. I'd say worth seeing.",28 Days Later...
397,Hal_Opinot-Pepper,"Not just one of the greatest horror movies; a great movie, period.",9,12 April 2021,"I will never forget that afternoon. I had been working overnight and into the next day cleaning up an IT mess at the office. By four in the afternoon I was exhausted and on my way home, and while waiting for the bus I decided I was a little wired in that way you sometimes are after an all-nighter, and decided to go take in a bad horror movie downtown to unwind before heading home. I knew nothing about 28DL except for having caught a glimpse of the commercials and figured there was no way a good zombie movie would ever come out in 2002. A brain-dead, terrible horror movie was exactly what I needed.Hooooooooooo was I wrong. I was fully unprepared for it to be not just a good horror movie, not even just a good movie period, but an absolutely stupendous one.There are a few horror movies that transcend the horror genre and are must-see films for any film buff: Rosemary's Baby. The Exorcist. The Shining. And 28 Days Later.Danny Boyle at the time was know primarily for Trainspotting, which probably deserved the accolades it got, although personally it wasn't a favorite of mine. But this... this was like he took all the work he put into making Trainspotting clever, and funny, and memorable, and redirected all that effort this time into one single goal: telling a good story. And this is a masterpiece of storytelling, in a way so few horror movies even bother to be. Horror movies tend to be an exercise in nothing but shock or scares, and plot and character take a back seat. But Boyle has no problem spacing out the horror sequences with moments of poignancy, beauty and emotional depth, as well showing as a more profound understanding of what makes horror work than most genre directors. The scene where he returns to his parents' house has some zombies in it, sure, but they only arrive after the true horror of that scene, which I won't risk having to post a spoiler alert to detail but I'm sure anyone who has seen it will remember that scene's incredibly quiet gut-punch forever. Then there are the quietly poetic interludes like the long minutes of Jim wandering a surreally empty London, the quiet overnight interlude in the ruins with the feral horses and Jim's surreal dream of running sheep, the dozens of rainbuckets sitting empty on Frank's rooftop showing why they can't stay in his apartment, or the image of Hannah running down the dark mansion halls in her red dress during the climactic sequence... it's very easy to forget how much of this film is not zombie action at all, just good old-fashioned movie storytelling. In fact, despite the some very memorable conventional horror scenes (like Jim's strange first encounter with the infected, before it is revealed to him what has happened) not that much of the screentime of this film is really horror scenes, and not that much the horror in this film comes from zombies. In many ways the ""zombie infection"" is just a backdrop to provide a setting for the deeper horrors in this movie.The reason I give it a 9-and, I'd have given it a 9 1/2 if that was possible-is the open-aperture camerawork for the action sequences, which was more of a cheap, flashy concession to ""ooh, look what we can do"" technological novelty than a good cinematic decision. It was faintly interesting at first glance, but not up to snuff with virtually verything else about the film, not even really neccessary, and hasn't aged well, even ignoring how quickly it became an overused cliche in less original zombie movies made in the shadow of this one.But that is the sole flaw, and a minor one, in one of the all-time great horror film masterpieces and really one of my favorite films, regardless of genre. This film is the result of an expert filmmaker at the top of his game, setting out to demonstrate that a great director can make great art in even the least-appreciated genre, and unquestionably succeeding. This is a really, really great movie.",28 Days Later...
398,charlesem,Don't ask,6,16 March 2017,"Danny Boyle's science fiction/horror film 28 Days Later was a critical and commercial success, which owes much, I suspect, to its post-apocalyptic theme, capturing a mood prevalent after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Many viewers noted the similarity of the kiosk in the film, covered with notices posted by people searching for lost friends and relatives, to the real ones posted in New York City after the fall of the World Trade Center towers -- a prescient touch on the part of the filmmakers, since the scene was shot before the terrorist attack and its aftermath. It has also been an influential film, helping spark an interest in ""zombie""* movies and TV shows. After a prologue that shows how animal-rights activists attacked a research laboratory and unwittingly released a virus that causes uncontrollable rage in its victims and is spread by contact with blood and saliva, the film's protagonist, Jim (Cillian Murphy), wakes up from a coma in a London hospital to discover that he has been abandoned there and that the streets outside are empty. (The premise of someone waking up from a coma to discover a world depopulated by an incurable virus was repeated by the creators of The Walking Dead, first for the graphic novel published in 2003 and later for the TV series that began in 2010.) Jim soon discovers that he is not entirely alone: He is attacked by people infected with the virus and rescued by two who weren't: Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley). Unfortunately, Mark gets bitten by one of the infected and has to be killed, allowing Selena to explain that the disease takes hold swiftly and is incurable. Naomie and Jim then discover two more survivors, Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter, Hannah (Megan Burns), who have a crank-operated radio that has picked up a signal from survivors north of Manchester calling for others to join them. Frank is infected and killed during their perilous drive northward, and Jim, Selena, and Hannah discover that the survivors are in a well-armed military outpost under the command of Maj. Henry West (Christopher Eccleston). It turns out that West has been sending out the signals especially to attract women to service his sex-starved troops, which means not only that Selena and Hannah are in danger of rape but also that Jim is expendable. Before he helps Selena and Hannah escape, Jim also hears the theory of a soldier opposed to West that the virus has not in fact spread worldwide: that it has been contained in other countries and that the island of Britain is quarantined -- a theory that Jim confirms for himself when he sees the contrails of a jet plane flying high overhead. The released film ends happily -- or at least hopefully -- when Jim, Selena, and Hannah, having escaped, construct a giant ""HELLO"" sign that is spotted by a plane flying reconnaissance over the cottage where they live. It's not the preferred ending of director Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland, who proposed a bleaker resolution of the story that failed with test audiences. Well-directed and -acted, 28 Days Later does what it's designed to do: build suspense and provide interesting characters. It also resonates nicely with our paranoia about pandemic infections in the age of HIV, Ebola, and the annual influenza scare . But it doesn't hold up well under the old test of Questions You're Not Supposed to Ask: like, why has Jim been abandoned, stark naked and comatose, in a hospital? If the hospital was attacked by the infected, why wasn't he attacked? If it was evacuated -- we see a newspaper headline, EVACUATION, at one point - - why was he left behind? How did he survive unattended for 28 days with only an IV drip that would have run out in a few hours? If the rest of the world is safe and only Britain is quarantined, why doesn't Frank's radio pick up international broadcasts? Where are the humanitarian operations like the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders? And so on....*The infected in 28 Days Later aren't technically zombies. i.e. animated dead people. They're still alive, and they can be killed by ordinary means like shooting or stabbing them.(charlesmatthews.blogspot.com)",28 Days Later...

400,mikeg994,Yet another Killer Virus,9,5 October 2008,"There are some themes, like the end of the world, that works of the imagination keep returning to over and over again. Rod Taylor in the 1959 classic film ""The Time Machine"" sees the human race destroying itself in a nuclear war only to reemerge with subterranean carnivorous morlocks farming a race of dumb blondes as a source of food while they greenly lurk underground. Charlton Heston in ""The Omega Man"" hides out in a heavily fortified compound, cruising the empty streets of the heavily fortified city while crazed, light-averse survivors of a plague wait until dark to pounce and destroy. Stephen King's film adaptation of his book ""The Stand"" shows us a world decimated by a killer influenza which has the survivors ending up in Las Vegas. And Michael Crichton has the demon agent coming from outer space in ""The Andromeda Strain"" and doing bad things to rubber and turning human blood to red dust. And now once again in the UK this time, ""28 Days After"" those generally untrustworthy scientists in secret labs are playing deadly games with germ warfare agents only to be unwittingly set free by animal rights guerillas. Having seen so many of these films before, I think ""28 Days Later"" does an excellent job of conveying the weird and horrible world of survivors of a holocaust.As a microbiologist I am in a somewhat better than average position to judge the scientific merits of such events. Certainly viruses and plagues have decimated populations in the past, from the Black Plagues of the middle ages, to the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the AIDS pandemic of today. The Ebola outbreaks of central Africa are perhaps the most mysterious and horrifying in recent memory, and in this era of worldwide air travel or of natural migrations of infected birds, it isn't far from reality. It is a good thing that public health officials maintain a certain vigilance.What sets ""28 Days Later"" apart is its ""realism"" (while of course being quite a work of imagination) however the virus is not the only heavy of the piece. While I could have told them not to take the tunnel, and would have probably put the car in reverse at the sight of all the wrecked cars underneath, and tried a bridge, and while I wonder at the tendency of contagion to turn normal people into murdering zombies who like rabid dogs attack and infect others, the curious turns of the plot where the characters make their way through a post-apocalyptic world where not all the villains are ""the infecteds"" made it a truly effective film in the horror genre. It was an excellent film.",28 Days Later...

This is your standard end of civilization/ avoid the zombies horror picture. It has all been done before, many times. It is interesting to figure out how under such duress the characters in this movie can continuously come up with nice new fashion outfits, all while they are fleeing for their lives in absolute terror.They must be consumer zombies, which is kind of horrifying, but not at all in the way I had wanted, or expected. Sure,it's the end of the world, but why stop shopping? In the end, the movie puts forward the idea that the army guys that are there to protect them, are the real monsters, worse even than the murderous hoards.  I reckon that is what some people prefer to believe, and you have to hope that they never have the opportunity to test out their theories in a truly bad situation, where things have fallen apart and they need help. But they will have their smug little attitudes until then, won't they?

Within a few days, almost everyone is infected with the same disease. Humans became ""zombie-like"" and they attack all non-infected life. A survivor (Jim) wakes up on a hospital's operating table and finds London (England) deserted 28 Days Later...
This movie has an alternate ending but it wasn't very well advertized. Most people in the cinema left when the credits appeared because they did not know about it. I read it on a newspaper review and decided to wait until after the end credits to see if there was really an alternate ending.
The ""official release"" ending wasn't very good. It was a pathetic saccharin Hollywood-style ending. For other films, happy endings are fine but it did not suit the nature of this particular film which had a dark and bleak theme. Apparently the alternate ending was its original ending and it was circa 4 minutes long but initial studio tests did not sit well with the average audiences. Unfortunately, Danny Boyle was forced to shoot a new ending! The alternate ending: After the credits, the words - ""But what if..."" appeared.When Jim was shot, the three drove out of the compound. The next scene was in a hospital where Selena and Hannah were frantically trying to save Jim from his wound. Jim died on the operating table. This ending was poignant as he woke up on an operating table at the beginning of the film and now he died on an operating table at the end of the film. He had gone a full circle and went back to where he began. Hannah and Selena leaves the hospital with a satisfactory ""what now"" question left unanswered by the story.
I thought the movie rated 4/10 with the ""sweet"" ending. Maybe 6/10 with the original ending. The movie was shot on video and eventually transfered to 35mm cinema film neg and pos stock. You'll notice how grainy the movie looked because of DV. It created a documentary feel but it's probably a low-budget production cost factor.",28 Days Later...

I'm a big Romero Dead fan and seeing artsy fartsy crap like this reminds me why i appeciate the Dead trilogy so much. By the way, I complained about the focus to the theater manager who spoke to the projectionist who related back to me through the manager that there was nothing he could do about the focus because it was a low grade film. Five is a pretty low grade which is what I give 28 Days later.

The worst thing about this film is that it somewhat ruins the rest of the genre for the viewer. You are left wondering about glaring plot holes in the ""undead"" variant of zombie flick such as: how difficult could it really be to escape zombies doing 2 feet a minute or less? How does the infection spread if the undead simply eat their victims whole? If the brain is the only part of the body responsible for animation (as in Walking Dead, for example), how do the undead move about without functioning circulatory systems, etc.? 28 Days Later doesn't have any of these physiological plot holes nor does it suffer from a situation where the lead actors are more deadpan than the zombies.",28 Days Later...

It is further doubtful a virus passed on through the blood could have wiped out a government in 28 days, the infected are dangerous but they aren't organised and cant use weapons, but they can be killed or, one presumes rounded up and caged till a treatment can be found 8.The Cillian Murphy character is about 8 stone soaking wet and has just woken up from a coma, yet manages to kill four trained, armed soldiers who use army fighting techniques on him earlier showing they know how to do it!.

AIDS and possibly SARS are the results.  And maybe it's this very plausibility that makes 28 Days Later truly frightening.This is a low budget movie, but the grainy film and use of on-hand weaponry really works.(Spoilers) Improbabilities?  Only two:  Western soldiers are the least likely to act like undisciplined rapists under pressure and a shot in the stomach by a 5.56mm NATO round is a good deal more difficult to recover from than it was made to appear, even with the best of medical care.I was quite surprised to see the IMDB ratings based on demographics.

410,claptonisgod53,Brought Back a Genre,7,19 January 2009,"George Romero shocked the world in 1968 with his film, Night of the Living Dead. It shocked audiences of all ages, disgusted the world, and even helped create the MPAA rating system. It is hard to watch any zombie movie without thinking about Night of the Living Dead.I myself would have to say that 28 Days Later is the most influential zombie movie since Night of the Living Dead. It might be risky to say that for two reasons: It is hard to compete with a classic, and the zombies in 28 Days aren't truly ""zombies."" Let's put that argument aside.28 Days Later is about an infection that almost completely wipes out England. The film follows around a man named Jim (Cillian Murphy) who wakes up in a hospital to empty England. He soon meets up with several other survivors as they try to survive in the zombie infected world.After several of the survivors incidentally get wiped out by the infection, the two surviving members of the group meet up in an army base with a squad of army men. This is where the movie truly began to fall for me. It started out almost perfect, but then we had to be introduced to an entirely new location, which ruined the originality of the first two-thirds of the movie. I didn't like the army scenes and thought that they not only ripped off George Romero's 1985 film, Day of the Dead, but they dragged my interest away from the true problem.Putting the final piece of the film aside, 28 Days Later has a number of suspenseful and enjoyable scenes which never fail to keep the viewer hooked. However, most of the movie felt like a build-up that ended in disappointment. What the movie DOES accomplish is the fact that it has a good cast, not a GREAT cast but a good cast. It was also able to create a whole different kind of zombie film (running zombies). The zombies in 28 Days may be nothing more than infected people, but they are still zombies when it comes to how they're shot. The Dawn of the Dead remake, as well as several other 28 Days Later rip-offs have taken the idea of running zombies of off this film.Another thing that 28 Days Later manages to do is to entertain, which is one of the key points in making a good movie.",28 Days Later...
411,forecastmazy,My friends couldn't speak for 10 minutes...,9,6 July 2003,"No, that's really a story my friends told me. And then my friend brought me out to see this movie over seeing T3. Was I glad I did so? You bet I was.28 Days Later has nothing to do with Resident Evil. In fact, the comparisons are obvious but 28 Days Later was made for a better reason, 28 Days Later is like a collection of all of the Zombie films you've ever seen made in a fresh and interesting way.Unlike Resident Evil, the powering force of Danny Boyle who brought us Trainspotting is behind this one. Oddly enough, people compare this film to Resident Evil endlessly but the film starts out where 12 Monkeys would leave it off. I find it funny that no one has made that comparison.
So, essentially what 28 Days Later is, is what Resident Evil 2 will be, but in London. People who dislike this movie will really SHlT a brick when RE2 comes out and it's.... uht oh... semi-based off a video game where the city is dead! OH NO! But these are just people who tend to complain, don't let them throw you off.Making a horror movie is very hard but this movie pushes all the right buttons and even the buttons Resident Evil didn't get to push. You see Resident Evil was made to appease to video game fans as well as fans of horror films. This movie was made to appease fans of cinema as well as the horror sub genre of Zombie Film (even though it's also a Sci-Fi sub genre, but we won't get into that.)The camera in this film captures moments in time and makes the sure moments of horror beautiful. Everything I wanted to happen... happened. The music fits perfectly with the film, the film converys lights in a beautiful way and all the while the city being empty seems horrifying even if we're not british. It all fits together at the right moment.Of course all the while you have to keep in mind our civilization is not too far away from 28 Days Later. I mean, how impossible is it for one of the American Testing labs in Boston on the MIT campus to accidentally release an animal onto Boston and cause a widespread disease that would have to be quarantined from the rest of the America, and the world? Surely not far off. Anything's possible.This movie truly blew me away. I've been waiting for this movie to come out for a while and it was worth every second of my wait and more. I feel in a way it was a foreign film because Danny Boyle shot it in British fashion which made every second of it even more beautiful.I truly believe anyone who disliked this movie is a person who feels the need to be negative as a critic or simply does not have interest in cinema as an art. 28 Days later is truly a beautiful movie, it is Art-Cinema in an apocalyptic way. Resident Evil is a great American action film and 28 Days Later is an amazing and beautiful art-cinema film from Danny Boyle, our favorite British director. Both are in the same genre, and both are very good films for their genre.I like how they connect and I think Danny did it purposely. To dislike this film is to have no taste in cinema. I'm sure the same people who hate 28 Days Later also hate Run Lola Run and would somehow find a way to hate Battle Royale and every other amazing foreign film. See this film, don't listen to your stoner friends who disliked it. But even that may be a misstatement, because I'm not even sure how a stoner could dislike this movie. It is truthfully beyond me how anyone can dislike this amazing piece of cinema.",28 Days Later...

The sub-sub genre which I refer to, I call: Post Apocalyptic, Last Normals Alive in an Urban Environment Ravaged by Psychotic Blood-Sucking Freaks!' Phew!!Although there is nothing really new in 28DL, I was entertained and generally satisfied mainly because I find the Post Apocalyptic, Last Normals Alive etc sub-sub genre really fascinating and frightening. I think the world of 28DL, The Omega Man and Night of the Comet (1984) represent the most terrifying circumstances a protagonist could find themselves in.28DL is tightly and expertly edited, however I did find the story a little too manufactured in places. Without putting any Spoilers into this review, there are scenes in the film where characters unnecessarily walk into dangerous situations. In other words there's forced interactions between the protagonist Normals and the Infecteds. Forced interactions between characters means lazy writing.I'm a bit unconvinced about some of the characters and their motivations. For example, human beings by their very nature are heavily addicted to structured society. In 28DL however there are some uninfected Normals whose basic drive is for short term pleasure and cruelty rather than doing constructive stuff. I know this is a debatable point, but I believe that given a circumstance which is highly stressful, Normals' are going to be motivated to stick together, co-operate and get things done.I think Alex Garland should have spent more effort shading some characters and this would have made 28DL more effective. There are characters in the film who are a little too 'one track minded' to be convincing. I also think there should have been a bit more time spent on explaining the Infecteds and their disease. I'm still confused as to whether they become entirely cannibalistic, or whether they just bite victims and spread infection.But overall, a good sub-sub genre effort. 7/10",28 Days Later...

It offers a interesting storyline which is believable in the world we live in today.

Though this is probably the best British film I have seen I reckon the ending sucked compared to the vibe of the rest of the movie.

'28 Days Later' came out in 2002, so it is relatively old now... But it looks horrible! I will let the low budget of this movie pull it's rating down. The zombies were not done well and made stupid sounds. The acting wasn't good, either, and many parts in this movie were extremely boring. Here in there, there would be some enjoyable scenes, but it would go back to being boring soon. Only good part in this movie was the end. I liked that part.The movie has an interesting plot and some good ideas, but all of the characters are bland and I didn't care about any of them for a while. Some good and smart events happened that sometimes made the scene enjoyable, but that would be that would be the leading event of the scene that carried it. The dialog made most of the scenes that were boring become boring. It would seem unrealistic and just not be interesting, because the characters were so bland that we didn't care what they said and how the acting was bad. It would also be the situations that they were in. By ""situations"" I mean consequences, chances, choices, and tasks. They had no thought behind them and went on too long. They weren't realistic so that would also bring them down. The fighting scenes also had basically no climax. They stayed the same through the whole scene and stayed uninteresting and unexciting. This was because until the movie was almost over, so I didn't care if they all died so there wasn't nothing necessarily to go for. (This excludes the end) There was bad music and unrealistic fighting, too. The movements of the infected and people were did not seem like they would happen, the way the humans defended themselves seemed ridiculous, and they isolated certain characters and major aspects of the plot of the movie so the scene go a certain way for our ""enjoyment"", which just made it less enjoyable for me. Also, the infected were unrealistic. They're zombies: they're not supposed to see that well, and they just go after a living thing they hear or smell to try to eat it. They're not smart enough to stop and listen when someone gets away and they don't know to wait for things to happen... And, they can't see that well, as I said one sentence ago. In this movie they went mainly by sight. That's not what zombies are.Now for things I did like in the movie... A much shorter list. The partially enjoyable actually had some somewhat clever dialog that seemed a bit enjoyable, but only worked because we had no idea what the character's were like, because they weren't introduced, so we wouldn't think that would they would be saying would be ridiculous for the character. Sometimes, the circumstances for the characters would be interesting, and what the characters had done as solutions in past circumstances would be interesting. Some of the choices the characters made and the chances the characters took would also be interesting. About half way through '28 Days Later' an event happened that I thought was smart, but strange. The introduction of this event was enjoyable, because it introduced new characters and places and did well. Sadly that's the only good thing I can say about that event, though, until the end. Now, here's what I thought about the end: It was enjoyable, and made sense sometimes, so it was good. There were some intense moments and some battle scenes that were cool. Some of the things in the end were realistic and made sense. It had some smart events that gives props to the movie. I also liked what they did at the very end. It had some more clever events, character's actions, and good dialog. It was also kind of realistic in some parts.This movie had a good ending and some partially enjoyable parts, but it had bad acting, bad dialog, bad battle scenes, unrealistic events, bland characters, bad music, and boring events and situations. My 4/10 rating means '28 Days Later' is not very good. It's not exactly bad, but it's not good and I didn't like it. I will not buy this movie and I do not recommend it to anyone who is considering watching it.",28 Days Later...

418,suicidalicecreamtruckdriver,Hopefully it redefines what horror could and should be.,10,26 April 2011,"28 DAYS LATER tells the story of a young man who is in hospital for 28 Days. During that time, a disease that turns people into citizens into flesh eating citizens. It's an apocalyptic film, but unlike other generic zombie films that Hollywood churns out every year, it is thrilling, scary, unpredictable, the political undertones are stronger and messages concerning humanity in the face of evil are strong. A fun, unpretentious horror movie that Danny Boyle is crafted in such an unpretentious way, that is memorable. Using its low budget to its advantage, it swaps typical CGI for gritty realism, which is something that works in its favor. Well acting by Cillian Murphy, bringing more to the typical 'average- Joe', he is a character that is interesting enough to care about. It could be argued that the ending could've been better, yet 28 Days Later creates enough thrills and scares for that to be forgotten. A great film, that should encourage low budget film makers to use it to their advantage, and horror film makers to have more to their films than meets the eye.Can't resist this cliché, but I'll remember it 28 Days later.",28 Days Later...

I had heard a lot of reviews of how good it was and I really enjoyed Trainspotting, so I guess I had my expectations a little high but I also wasn't too attracted by it at the same time. Overall the movie is good. It has good acting and an interesting story but I really don't consider this to be a masterpiece or even to be a disturbing movie at all (maybe I'm just too jaded already). The most outstanding features about the movie was that it was made with such a low budget, the story was very nicely told and it's nice to see the characters as human beings rather than unbelievable one dimensional characters which Hollywood is so used to produce. This is a movie that will certainly entertain you if you know what to expect, and I tell you, don't expect too much gore or even to get very scared or disturbed (well at least that didn't happen to me), because I think the main goal of the movie is to tell a story and not just to shock and impress, and I give it credit for that.",28 Days Later...
420,garboventures,"striking, stylish, sometimes harrowing",9,11 September 2004,"28 Days Later is a fine piece of British film-making. For me, (as a Brit), this post-apocalyptic film, replete with striking, often stirring images of a desolated Britain, resonated that much more than the typical US-set disaster movie. The deserted London streets were especially effective. The road trip mid-section is also worthwhile. The effects and overall camera-work are used judiciously and to stylish effect.The film also features some fine performances - Cillan Murphy in particular. (SPOILER) His final, raging killing spree, bare-chested, gleaming pallour, splattered with blood, is slightly reminiscent of Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now. This sequence of events comes across as somewhat shocking, as up to this point (bar a cold-blooded incident with a baseball bat and an infected child) Murphy's character has appeared too gentle, even for his own good. Less impressive were the red-eyed, blood-spewing Infecteds, Christopher Ecclestone's over- wooden performance, and a slightly confusing 'happy ending'. Unlike other commentators, I didn't find this ending too trite or unwelcome, but more explanation would have been preferred.",28 Days Later...

Watching it, though, I just couldn't ignore the numerous logical lapses that occur. It is a work of fiction, true, but the main characters do a lot of things in this movie that people in the Real World simply would not do. Their choices and decisions seem to serve only to put them in a position for the next shocking scene. Speaking of which, once I started thinking about the virus that infects the population of the UK, I kept wondering ""Why aren't these blood-spewing hyperactive zombies attacking each other? Wouldn't they have died of dehydration and blood loss long before starvation became a problem?

425,tcdarkness,"Atmosphericly heart-pounding, but had flaws",7,4 July 2003,"As a big fan of zombie movies, I knew I had to go see this film in theaters. Sure, the infected are not zombies in the dead sense, but they are close enough.  Like most good zombie movies, the film relied on the characters' response to the zombies for a look at how people react than just making it a shoot-em-up movie.  We do care for the good characters and since they are always in harms way, it is tense to see them in danger.  One good guy dies early on in the film, so we know that there is not a guarantee that the people in the movie will live.The film starts out with a bang, then suddenly goes limp for about 10 minutes.  As the zombies pour in, the film finally advances in entertainment.  Danny Boyle's direction is very claustrophobic in this film. We cannot tell in a lot of shots of the zombies exactly how far away they are from the protagonists.  There is a scene in a tunnel where four people have to change a tire as we see the shadows and silhouettes of zombies closing in.  Then the film goes limp again with too much dream sequencing. Then it builds to a climax with some troops, the best part of the movie.While the film can terrify, there are some flaws that keep it from being a great work.First and foremost, DIGITAL VIDEO.  Why did Boyle decide to shoot the picture in this format?  This film looks horrible projected.  Anything in the background, even when it is the focus, is blurred.  The film would have been much better off shot on High Definition,  which can easily achieve the same color saturation as DV, is still easier to setup than a film camera, costs a little more but gives a clear, naturally 16x9 picture.The music, while I like the fact that it slowly builds, is annoying.  The creators let it build up too high so that it is deafening and you just want the damn music to end.  And then there are scenes without music (or where it builds too slowly) and it really needs it to keep it from being too slow.The MTV-style video editing during action scenes is atrocious.I won't give away the ending, but the film did seem to drone on at times where I thought ""THIS was the ending"" (or we were near it)... and then the movie kept going.  This is especially true about 3 minutes away from the REAL ending when a still frame is used and it goes to black at just the right moment that we think ""this is the end.""The film could have been great.  This effort by Boyle isn't anywhere near Trainspotting.  5/10",28 Days Later...
426,CantripZ,Danny Boyle Strikes (Out) Again!,1,30 April 2008,"This may be close to blasphemy (especially since I'm British), but why do people like Danny Boyle films? The only reason I can see is that, although they're British, they're relatively professional-looking.The characters are almost invariably stick people, badly defined and never straying from the definition they're given when they first appear.The exciting stuff (a corpse, some smack or a bunch of red-eyed crazies) is always presented in such a way that it's obviously intended to be clever, even when it patently isn't.I actually agree with many of the common complaints about this movie. There wasn't much action - which is fine if you're making a horror flick, but it's not scary. Or a character drama, but the characters are laughable (unless they're played by Christopher Ecclestone, and then only because Ecclestone rocks). Or a gore flick, but there wasn't any.The ending is facile, and the re-made ending is just a joke.I payed 50p for this on second hand VHS, but I still felt like I wasted my money.All your Brits out there who loved this, be honest -- did you give it a few bonus points for being British? Or more than a few...? This is maybe fun if you're new to the horror genre, but it's hardly a worthy successor to the classics by Romero or Cronenberg which have dealt much more powerfully (and originally) with similar themes.So, instead of watching this, go rock ""Shivers"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"" - even the debut films of these two great directors can dish out a weighty slap to this substanceless piece of cheap nonsense.",28 Days Later...
427,skullballmovies,"Original, but not my type of zombie movie.",6,3 August 2009,"28 Days Later might not be what you expect. Yeah, it's got a lot of action, but it's not your typical zombie movie. There aren't towns full of them, which is a change, for better or worse. In my opinion, it was an original change, but I wasn't all for it. It barely shows any gore or blood and when it does, it shows it for maybe 5 seconds. This was dissatisfying, but good for people who want to start out with a zombie movie that isn't guts flying all over the screen for 2 hours and still keeps an R rating. My favorite part about the movie was Cillian Murphy starred in it. He's not only a great actor, but one of my favorites. It sucks he's not in too much. He's an underrated actor just like Thomas Jane. What's really crazy about this movie is the zombies are moderately smart. They're full of energy and they usually know what to do. Also the military people turning on the main characters was a good choice, with the whole world ending and all, or whatever you want to think of it as. So to wrap it all up abruptly as to not make this review too long, it's great for people getting into horror movies, and great for people who want something a little different.",28 Days Later...
428,manalone923,"Maybe not as scary as you've heard, but certainly a serious, greatly made study of humanity with definite horror moments.",10,1 December 2003,"I LOVED this film. When I left the theater, I felt utter satisfaction and deep despair at the same time. That means the movie definitely worked.For starters, please don't automatically label it a horror film. It isn't a slasher akin to Friday the 13th or a disturbing no-sleep fest like the Exorcist was at one time, either. What it IS is a moving human drama, very effectively capturing the despair and isolation of a world after apocalyptic disease. This is its strongest point and mood, but at the same time there are several seat-jumping moments, and there are, for lack of a better word, ""monsters"" that are around many corners. I don't anticipate many will walk away from 28 days later thinking ""wow, I was shaking in fear the whole time!"", nor do I imagine people thinking ""What a body count! All that blood and guts!""  Truth is, there are some moments of both, but they are frosting on a story that leaves you with more of a feeling of ""Wow. Loved ones can be lost, times can be impossibly desolate, people can be impossibly cruel. I'm glad to be alive, and I'm glad I live in a better world"".The setting of the film is London, almost entirely free of human life due to a rapidly spread virus. The infected, the ""monsters"" of the film, are regular human beings who no longer function like regular people but instead are fast, violent, and primal, living only to eat and attack whatever they see. The virus spread wildly due to its high communicability. It transfers through blood contact, saliva, and even through the eyes. It is such that 99% of London was wiped out in 28 days, at the end of which the main character wakes up in a hospital with no idea what has happened. No one knows the answer to a more haunting question either...Is life normal outside a possibly quarantined London, or was the whole world infected?The movie slowly lets us see what happens and slowly suggests answers to those questions. It unfolds not like a harsh killfest, but like poetry. We are with the main character, Jim, as he wakes up, having no idea where to go or where anyone is. He wanders the starkly empty streets, alone, hoping to find someone who can help,and somewhere to go. He encounters the infected, and he meets some people...All with their own view of their situation and ways of dealing with it. Some live to survive. Some live in despair. Some live with hope.It's situations like this that are touching. Thanks in part to a wonderful score, the story gives us many moments to take in. Jim heads out to see if his parents are okay. Another man puts out a beacon of Christmas lights on his empty apartment in hopes of finding other survivors. We watch in sympathy as one person remembers a simple, pointless breakfast with the family he/she will never see again. We quietly smile in hope as someone plows their way through a dangerous roadblock through sheer determination for a better place. We close our eyes in defeat as another person who has so much hope and even more to live for still succumbs to the disease due to the most chance of situations. Moments like these- sadness, warmth, hope, despair- are rife in this film, and it is through such moments that it truly feels like a realistic account of what could honestly happen. It is a very human story, and I say that because although there are scenes of violence and death, this overcomes the boundary of ""horror flick"" by focusing most on the people, their plight, and the moments that matter to them. The acting is thoroughly good as well, with everyone asking realistic questions and doing things that appeal to us in some way or another. There are some characters near the end for example who have their own idea of survival and what it takes, and even though their ideas are horrible we can still understand why they have them. My only gripe with the film is minor. I enjoyed it all the way, and was satisfied by the last few frames. But the actual climactic event, which takes place in a mansion, was a little frenzied. I don't mind violence or anything, and there are sudden scenes in the rest of the film where things get wild, but the final major event is very harsh and sustained. It makes sense, it's just not as reserved as most of the rest of the film so be forewarned.In all, I found this movie entirely good. Don't expect the bloodiest or scariest movie ever, but be content with some of both inside a much more mature and emotional film, and you should be happy. I definitely was, and found it one of the most thought-provoking and moving dramas, or horror films, in a long time.",28 Days Later...

I mean, it is not any effort to imagine a tragic illness that can drive the people crazy and spreads so fast that it results in chaos and death. But the attitude and behavior of the infected people is ridiculous. They're supposed not to be able to do almost anything, but they coordinate themselves to attack. Also, they are TRIBAL. Infected people live, sleep and act together, so they can attack the normal ones more easily... this is quite absurd. I couldn't understand why the father and daughter insist on announcing their presence to everyone, infected or not, by lighting on all those Christmas lights...

431,connorwburnett,Blew me away,9,29 August 2021,"I'm not sure I would classify 28 days later as a ""horror film"" as this implies that the main aim of the film is to frighten the viewer. Don't get me wrong, 28 days will certainly frighten you, however, it brings so much more to the table than that. It is a densely packed film which will grip you to the very end.The main story follows our lead protagonist - Cillian Murphy - waking up in a London hospital 28 days after the outbreak of a virus in the UK.This synopsis will sound familiar to many of you as one year later it would crop up again in the first issue of the Walking Dead graphic novels. I don't know who had this idea first, but nonetheless it doesn't change how effective this way is to open a post apocalyptic setting. It instantly allows the audience to form a close bond with the protagonist as both are new to this world, equally having to adapt to its dangers.This is executed flawlessly in 28 days. After waking from the hospital, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wanders through London presented in the form of a montage. The shots are primarily wide long-shots allowing the viewer to gauge how much destruction this virus has caused. The camera angles are usually distorted or unnatural, mirroring Jim's helplessness and realisation of his current situation.In fact the direction throughout the film is, for the most part, pretty stellar. The shots are creative and can easily be analysed. This grants 28 days an extra layer of artistic value, however - where other films fail - the artistic elements of 28 days do not disrupt from the natural flow of the story, making it a far more entertaining watch. I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but by far my favourite aspect of the direction was how it depicted the ""infected"" which was made even more successful by my favourite aspect of the entire film: The use of audio.28 day's diegetic and non-diegetic sound work together brilliantly to enhance the film's atmospheric qualities. The soundtrack/score is made up of wildly different pieces of music, however, they are all used at the perfect times to reflect the character's emotions and what the director wants you to feel. Equally, the diegetic sound, or even more importantly, lack of sound, acts as the engine that runs the film. I'm not going to spoil why, but the lack of audio in some scenes was perhaps the most frightening part for me.Apart from a couple places in the film where the sounds didn't seem quite right, or maybe a little over the top, sound as a whole is handled exceptionally well.So how do the characters stack up in relation to the other aspects of the film? In general, 28 days was performed very well, with the standout certainly being Cillian Murphy. He gives the protagonist flaws and personality which actually makes him feel like a real person, something which is very rare in ""zombie films"". Although, the only thing holding this film back in my eyes are some of the decisions the characters make. Of course, you have to take into account their situation and how scared they must be, however, at some points they acted so stupid it just distracted me.Overall, 28 Days Later is a thrilling, intense experience. A must watch for anyone looking to be frightened, or any film fans in general.",28 Days Later...
432,walkerus,I know this story and it was better then.,6,18 December 2015,"Back in England many years ago, when Radio was still vibrant and important, there was a serial program that was very like this movie.I can't remember the reason why most people had been killed off, but there were a few who for one reason or another had survived and they set off out of London when they heard of a safe zone in the English Lake District (ring any bells yet) On the way they encountered all sorts of problems and losses, till eventually they arrived at the stronghold in the Lake District. But there were other strongholds in the area who had ideas of taking over the resources and women of our groups stronghold.That is all I can remember of the program except that as a young boy about 10 year old it fired my imagination and later when I used to go rambling and camping around the Lake District I would look for good valleys to defend and springs for water etc.This movie reminded me very much of that series. I found the infected people a little over the top for my taste. I also could not understand why Jim did not get guns etc. from gun-shops in London to defend himself. A baseball bat may be OK for a deli owner but not to keep alive against hoards of biting maniacs.All in all a slightly disappointing movie that could have been better with more realistic events during their travels north and cleverer use of infected peoples.

435,AloysiusWeasley,Pretty good flick,7,31 December 2007,"I thought this movie was pretty much on par with the likes of the (updated) Dawn of the Dead. Definitely in the top zombie movies ever, that's for sure.Here's what I liked: - You felt for the characters, even though you never find out much at all about their background or where they came from. You want them to succeed, that's for sure.The imagery when Jim is walking around deserted London is A+ Lots of moments to make you jump.Enjoyable DVD extras, though (as always) I can do without the stupid director's commentary The humorous bits were generally amusing and didn't detract from the film, as they do in many other movies.Things I didn't enjoy so much: I wasn't a big fan of the whole giant spot in the movie devoted to the soldiers deciding they were going to rape the women, and making them get dressed up, and all that rubbish. I think after Jim was knocked out with the rifle butt, the major saying they needed to keep the women for breeding purposes was enough. It just kind of started to drag on, and instead of believing they were necessary, by the end of it, you were left with the feeling the soldiers were just moronic horny guys.I read in some of the comments that the actual broadcast saying other countries had been infected was false, but honestly, I didn't catch it in the movie. Thus, I was left with the wonderment of ""How did they get onto planes and trains, when the infected go berserk in 20-30 seconds? Wouldn't someone have NOTICED?"". But since my 'suspension of disbelief' threshold is pretty high, I wasn't overly bothered, luckily.I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just left you with the feeling of needing..a little bit more. Not just the sequel, but as though it needed to be a little bit longer in some crucial points, to extend the emotion and horror of the situation a bit. Also, not a major thing, by any means.Would have liked more information about the virus - apparently, it's available, but only if you get the graphic novel. >:( Bottom line - be prepared to be left very, very paranoid when this movie's over.

444,isenberg-e,Excellent end-of-the-world scenario with a flawed ending,9,6 March 2005,"Although the plot is very unoriginal, I especially liked this version of the story because of the leisurely pace that sets the mood without letting you get bored. The Director didn't mind relatively long sequences without dialog when it was called for; I'm not sure a Hollywood-made film (this one was made in the U.K. by a U.K. company) would have been willing to do this. Ever since Star Wars the reigning action-movie concept in Hollywood seems to be action every 7 minutes max.I also liked the cinematography. There were great shots (extremely wide, taken from an unusual angle, etc.) that were unorthodox and in another film would have gotten in the way, but here they helped set the mood of a few people isolated in a huge city.I imagine it would be an even better experience in the theater, where the larger format and viewer being in the dark would have enhanced the feeling of isolation.**** SPOILER *** The one flaw is the ending, and unfortunately it is a bid problem. In the penultimate scene, the male protagonist (Jim) is shot in the stomach. Now, even in a modern big city, stomach wounds are very often fatal, and virtually always so without prompt surgery. Not only will the victim bleed to death, but even if the bleeding can somehow be stopped, peritonitis will almost always set in. Nevertheless, without anyone having more than a pharmacist's knowledge of medicine, with no surgical tools, and after a car ride where he would certainly have bled out, Jim survives. The last scene shows him hale and hearty, running over a meadow. I suppose there could be some explanation, but none was given, and it broke me out of my ""willing suspension of disbelief.""Nevertheless, I give the film a ""9"". Definitely worth watching and re-watching.",28 Days Later...
445,NightOfTheLivingDon,Overrated. Nothing special.,1,18 May 2007,"I remember when ""28 Days Later"" was in theaters. After about a month or so, the television ads were up to a full minute to a minute and a half long. They were packed with sterling reviews, thrilling speedy zombie cut scenes, and the promise of three possible endings! A few friends of mine went to see the movie five times so that they could see all three. They weren't the only ones. A ton of my friends were quick to say things like, ""You, of all people, will love this movie!"" Hype hype hype. If there is one thing I can't friggin' stand is every one and their grandmother telling me I have to see one particular movie. Given, hyped movies are either good or are ruined by the hype and that ratio is hovering around 50%. However, this movie falls into the latter. It wasn't the worst movie ever (close, but at least it had a budget), though right from the start I had issues. Now, I'm down with the idea that some hippie, animal liberation bozos would end up destroying society, but the whole first scene was weak. The movie started becoming promising only to rot away and FAST! I don't know, I personally don't see how this movie is any different than ""Dawn of the Dead"" other than the fact that ""DotD"" was a criticism on consumerism and ""28 Days"" was a commentary on...sex? ""Soldiers are horny"" seems to be this movie's overall message. Was the ending supposed to reflect something else, because any and all attempts to convince me otherwise have Stretch Armstrong shaking his head. I've been reading the glowing comments of this movie, and also shaking mine. I've read that it plainly deals with the hopelessness of the situation...as if ""DotD"" or even ""Return of the Living Dead"" didn't. There's nothing particularly special about this movie. And talking about ""Return,"" I think it's bull to declae ""28 Days"" as the introduction of the ""Fast Zombie."" There were plenty of zombies running around in ""Return of the Living Dead"" and ""RotLD Part 2."" How about the scene when all the zombies bum rush the cops? There are two separate scenes of zombies bum rushing the cops in ""RotLD,"" and another one when they take out the paramedics! So what, we should give credit to ""28 Days"" because some of the zombies were superhumanly fast? We should give it full marks for making them faster? Please. Also, I've read that the movie's landmark because it doesn't rely on violence. Instead it relies on changing a tire really really quickly so the stampeding herd of zombies don't infect you. Come on! This is supposed to be tension? It was like watching NASCAR! Oh, and how about calling the disease ""rage?"" How friggin' hokey can you get? Oh, and only one of the possible three endings was decent. There was certainly a reason why the other two weren't in the original final cut. I will say that the sequel looks interesting, not that I'm going to pay theater prices to see it, but I will definitely give it a try on DVD. As for the predecessor, I'll just leave it for the monkeys.",28 Days Later...
446,toews-55064,An absolutely terrible movie.,1,7 November 2021,"I was promised an exciting, scary, violent, and amazing movie. Unfortunately, I ended up wasting two hours of my life on one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Everything about this movie is terrible, except for one scene. That scene is the shot where Jim is walking around empty London, it's a very neat scene. Unfortunately, the movie decides to ruin that as well by bursting your eardrums with insanely loud music- the movie really likes to do this. The acting is awful, as none of the actors are able to deliver a remotely good performance. The movie looks very cheap- the entire film looms grainy. The movie has an interesting premise- the coma is the only well executed part of the movie, but the fast and smart zombies(?) are ridiculous. The action scenes are hard to watch. There are so many cuts that you cannot tell what is happening. The story makes no sense at all. I really don't want to go into it, it's so ridiculous. The way the virus spreads makes no sense. The infected are not scary or creepy in the slightest. One scene I laughed particularly hard at was after the characters escaped London, they found a grocery store (completely untouched) and it played a shopping montage reminiscent of a rom-com. In conclusion, this movie is absolutely terrible. I cannot understand how anybody would get any enjoyment out of this. I have no idea why there are any scores higher than a 2/10. Do not watch this movie.",28 Days Later...
447,sivadparks-89786,Poor direction and lighting plagues this great writing,6,5 March 2017,I was really looking forward to this. The beginning is pretty good and the characters are instantly realized. This is far from a bad movie. The story goes an interesting direction and has a clever end that was almost thrilling... But the direction is terrible. There is so much shaky cam and poor lighting it's impossible to tell what's going on. A gun will shoot then the camera will flail and you won't know what happened. The lighting is off. It's often too Bright or too dark. I'm not nitpicking. It was legitimately hard to follow what was happening. If this was shot more like a Romero movie where it focuses on the characters with more subtle action it would have been an amazing movie.,28 Days Later...
448,chains01,28 Days Later...,8,12 October 2009,"Recently Danny Boyle won the best directing Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, a worthy award winner in my opinion. Boyle is a director that never rests on his laurels, recreating genres every time he steps up to the plate. One of his most familiar is the polarizing dramedy Trainspotting, but he's also recreated the sci-fi movie with Sunshine, the kids movie with Millions and so on. Danny Boyle is a filmmaker worthy to be listed among the great auteurs like Scorsese, Hitchcock, and so on. With 28 Days Later... (unfortunately, often referred to as a ""zombie"" movie, though it's not) he tackles horror with excellent precision.28 Days Later opens with scenes of violence being watched by a monkey on a TV screen as he lays strapped down in a lab. Extremist animal activists break into the lab in an effort to save the animals from being tested on only to find they've been infected with a highly contagious virus known as Rage. Disaster leads to death and devastation throughout all of London. Cut to Jim (Cillian Murphy) 28 days later, a bike courier waking up from a coma in an empty hospital. After wandering across London, bewildered by the lack of people, he's saved by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) as he's being chased by the infected denizens of the city. After finding other survivors, Frank and Hannah (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns), they hear a radio broadcast from a military installment which houses other horrors for our survivors.While often considered a zombie movie, and it borrows liberally from many past zombie movies, 28 Days Later is not a zombie movie. The infected in this movie are living beings, infected by a virus that similar to Ebola is communicable by blood, and has more affect on the brain than the physicality of a human being. This is important to the message of the movie as the virus represents something that is inherent in all of us and leads to social unrest and the breakdown of modern society, as the virus did in the movie. In this Boyle has done something that he does very well in every one of his movies: creates a great social commentary. Throughout the course of the movie we see that there are those who would fight against a society gone wrong, and those that would exploit it. Yet, while exploring the themes of moral ambiguity, Boyle never handles them with a heavy handed approach.Having a moral/ social message is important to good horror in this reviewers opinion, but how the movie looks and feels is easily just as important to hold the viewers attention. Boyle chose to shoot the majority of the movie with DV cameras, giving the movie a gritty post apocalyptic type feel while also giving the movie a kind of documentary feel as well. On top of that, the DV camera also allowed for tricks that gives the infected an otherworldly look, making them seem scarier when they're bum rushing their ""prey"". The visuals selected to fill the frame also give you a glimpse at an alien world, a city, or a grocery store that should be buzzing with people, but because of the look of film, it seems even more eerie when you see it emptied of all presence.The acting of course is top notch, as anyone whose seen Brendan Gleeson act would expect, but the movie really belongs to Cillian Murphy who had his break out performance in this movie. As Jim, a man who went down one day in a bustling city, and woke up the next in an empty city, Murphy shows the pain of a man whose lost everything before he even knew what had happened to him. Cillian gives us a man in the middle of a crisis that we truly believe his arc from a pained and scared man just waking up at the end of the world to a man who will fight through all hell to protect those he cares about. Naomie Harris, who also received great acclaim for this movie, portrays a strong woman struggling with her fear and sorrow, but always holding it in, trying to steel herself from pain to come. Also keep your eyes open for Christopher Eccleston, who will become the future Dr. Who a few years after this movie.For as great as the movie is though, I do have my nitpicks. Calling the virus Rage seems a little too on the nose for my tastes, but luckily this isn't mentioned too often throughout. At the beginning there are also glaring plot holes in the scheme of today's society. Why is Jim the only patient to not be evacuated from the hospital? And why did they leave a comatose patient naked in the ICU? Why are there no cars left on the streets of London, or along the highways? A lot of this is due to the budget of the film, and can be explained away, but as there are no answers to be found within the actual narrative of the movie they must be left as plot holes. Luckily, as the only plot holes are mainly to be found at the beginning of the movie they do not detract from the movie as a whole, and will be forgotten by most by the end of the movie.For fans of horror, and movies with a deeper socio-political meaning this is definitely a must watch, but think before you decide to show this to your kids. There is full male nudity, as well as a lot of cursing. But if you're looking for a captivating horror this movie is definitely for you.",28 Days Later...

What I did was grip the arms of my theater seat and I don't think I blinked during the entire film.  This movie had a quick pulse interrupted by fast and furious camera work.  Sound is as important to this film as the visuals. This movie is visceral but also philosophical.  What is survival?  What is friendship?  Who are the bad guys?

It really crushes the viewer into a state of complete hopelessness with it's masterful cinematography and haunting soundtrack.The characters are all very well written, and they all find themselves lost in a harsh reality, that drives them to their absolute edge, where they decide if they should keep their humanity or give in to this unforgiving new world. These are all qualities by the books zombie movies have, but none of them reach the levels of dread ""28 Days Later"" has, but it also is a very well structured drama movie, that tells the story of a man, who has lost everything and is forcefully thrown into this new world. The movie masterfully balances those genres, which results in a piece of art, that breathes fresh air into a stale genre.Using rage as a means to create the viral outbreak gives it more belieavabilty, since they take some time to explain how it all began, and not throw us some made up impossible virus, that raises the deceased. It's a scary possibility that gives the movie solid ground to work on.While the sequel may not be of the same level of quality, this movie gives everything it's got to the viewer, and never disappoints with scaring you and giving you lots of food for thought, regarding our humanity.",28 Days Later...
452,sackleywhistle,"Not for everyone, but great for those that get in on it",10,22 December 2002,"First thing's first: not everyone is going to like this film. Its loud, violent, its shot on low-end DV and its a zombie movie.However, it is one of the best. With more than a little tip of the hat to George A. Romero, this film wastes no time getting into its story. A prologue - horribly botched by the appearance of the least appropriate actor of all time for this scene - tells us that a bunch of chimps have been injected with a serum which consists of pure, murderous rage. Unfortunately, a bunch of activists let them out and the virus gets released into society. And then, 28 days later... ...there's no-one left, apart from a few militarist survivors of an epidemic which has claimed everyone else. Into this changed world, we follow Cillian Murphy's Jim as he wakes up in hospital, unaware, adjusts and tries to survive with a handful of people that have found a way to fight back.This film pulls no punches and makes no excuses - if you dont buy into the concept, its not going to make it easy for you. If you do, it will rock your world. The early vision of a deserted london is epic and eerie thanks to the rough footage which gives the feel of waking from a drunken sleep mixed with cctv footage. Straight away, we know this is going to be a bloody ride, from the screeching and butchering of the chimps, into Jim's self-defense in a zombie-filled church by beating a former priest round the head, then into the attacking zombies getting napalmed with molotovs by his rescuers. And it barely lets up, getting more messed up and more violent...But there is time to look at what it would be like to live in a world where everyone you've ever known or loved is dead, not knowing how far it spread and whether there is any point in going on. There are occasional touching moments, particularly in the main duo's relationship with a man and his daughter who are holed up in a high-rise building. The focus of the film is their journey together to find other survivors, and is humorous and wonderfully acted, particularly by Murphy and the ever-reliable Brendan Gleeson.But whenever the film threatens to slow-down, brighten up or ponder, it bursts into violent, shocking action. There are twists and uncomfortable concepts every few minutes and the final act builds to a loud, bloody crescendo which is very unsettling. The only real gripe is with the film's bookends - the aforementioned prologue and a coda which, while necessary, borders on phoney.All in all, its a real ride and while it does kick up some interesting ideas, its main goal is to entertain, shock and unsettle and it does all three in equal measure. On this evidence, Danny Boyle is finally living up to the promise he showed in Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. For my money, this is his best yet.",28 Days Later...
453,mjcfoxx,2 Hours Later...,7,11 July 2013,"I'm not gonna lie. This movie doesn't really get on its feet until Brendan Gleeson makes in appearance. Before this moment, there's an unnecessary expository prologue and then Cillian Murphy wakes up in a hospital (apparently zombies are like T-Rexes: they can't see you if you don't move)... and once he's up and walking the streets of London, he acts mostly like an idiot, guzzling a Pepsi in one clean gulp, and reading the most awesome Headline ever before tossing the paper away without bothering to read the story (in a similar situation, I would have read every piece of news I could get my hands on).Zombie movies are never scary and since Romero seemed to set in stone the idea that they must be allegories of our baser natures, every one has managed to try to say something about us through this motif (well, every GOOD zombie movie). I sound cynical about this one, but only the first quarter of it disappointed. Once it becomes interested in the characters and stops trying so hard to be a ""post-apocalyptic zombie film"" it really begins upping the game. People stop taking turns acting like idiotic pricks and start caring about each other and suddenly we have a movie worth watching on our hands. Does that make it less stupid in places? Nawp. Does it make it any less entertaining? Oh, absolutely not. There's enough action porn, suspense, and semi-plausible developments to keep most everyone tossing their popcorn; and isn't that the main reason horror movies exist?",28 Days Later...
454,dalbuc,God awful and dull,1,28 June 2003,"I'm a sucker for a good zombie-type film but I was cheated on this flick. Minor spoilers.First off, this is not a zombie flick anymore than the Blair Witch Project was about the witch or Signs was about aliens. In all three cases the ""monster"" is used as a device to explore human problems (and in fairness Night of the Living Dead does the same thing). I like the latter three films becuase while they aren't just monster movies the monsters are sort of omnipiresent and you feel their influence constantly in the film. 28 Days Later doesn't do that. The ""rage"" infected (the zombies are vicitms of, shocker, a bioexperiment gone wrong and unleashed) are intermittently in the film and there are times you totally forget about them.Second, the main conflict in the film arises sort of out of nowhere- I won't divulge what it is. It makes no sense what so ever and the ""good"" guy's solution to it is to kill all sorts of non-zombies by working with the ""zombies"". You might be able to rationalize some of the actions of the real bad guys but when you realize that society has been gone for all of 28 days at most it gets hard to accept that all societal norms could vanish so quickly- escpeially among folks not in the heat of the moment, spare me about riots and such things.Third, Danny Boyle has the camera sense of the guy who filmed Battlefield Earth. Too many shots on tilts. His handling of action is outright abominable. He's not good with action so he resorts to the classic close shots, bad lighting and frequent cuts to obscure his failures. I don't know why folks still do this since the end result is that you can't see anything happening in the climax. That would assume you care since the zombies are killing bad guys anyway. In BWP, Signs and NotLD you are emotionally invested in the trapped would-be victims but in this flick you don't care a lick about the zombie show and might even be rooting for thier demise. Scarey it ain't.Oh, BTW, one last little gripe at a key moment a British solider has his gun jam- and of course can not clear the jam. This is a really tired movie cliche and deux et machina effect but worse is that all soliders act like they've never been trained to clear a jam.",28 Days Later...

456,GorgonHeep,A new favorite of mine!,10,8 July 2003,"Upon seeing ""28 Days Later..."" last night, I quickly added it to the list of my top-10 favorite films. I thought the cinematography was darkly beautiful and rich. It is rare that films are able to capture the environment of the horror they're trying to show effectively. The scenary fit the storyline and action perfectly! Another aspect of ""28 Days Later..."" that I enjoyed was the apocalyptic nuances of the film that were portrayed, such as calling the infection ""Rage"", as rage between people in reality may someday bring about the end of the world. Also, the idea of the necessity of women. The film has an ""excess"" of male survivors, and few female ones (only two that are shown to us in the film). Without women, what is the point of being a survivor when there is no means for reproduction and regrowth of human life. This is realized by some of male characters in the film, and mixed with lust, becomes yet another apparent downfall of some of the human beings in this film; the need for survival versus decency between people.     The idea of the apocalypse and survival in this film also brings into light the point that people need each other not for just physical survival, but for emotional survival. As the character, ""Hannah"" points out, some of the survivors might need the others more so (due to being physically weaker or slower, etc.), but all of the survivors need each other. Let's face it, if the world was basically over, and what was left was not worth bringing new life into it and starting anew, wouldn't you rather enjoy your present life as much as possible with other people, rather than making sacrifices of others just for a futile attempt at survival? Overall, I thought that ""28 Days Later..."" was an incredible film. I eagerly await it's release on DVD! I give it a vote of ""10""!!",28 Days Later...
457,mw_director,"Pretty good, but not great, horror opus",6,8 July 2003,"My rating: 6/10Though it's a return to form for Danny Boyle after such post-Trainspotting disasters as A Life Less Ordinary and The Beach, 28 Days Later could have risen to a higher potential. The opening scenes of a deserted London are tremendously effective, but some other scenes lose their full horror value because Boyle rushes through them, such as a scene involving a hurried tire-change before the onrushing hordes of the ""infected"" arrive. It flies by so fast we never get that ""Oh Dear God hurry up!"" sense of panic a horror film ought to build in the viewer.Basically, what you have here is the same premise as The Omega Man or, amusingly, Demons. People are infected with ""rage,"" which causes them to become mindless murdering beasts with fierce red eyes. It's stylishly shot, but the script unfortunately glosses over characterization: we barely know our hero, Jim, or his traveling companions Selena and Hannah. So our ability to fully feel what they have lost is muted.The gore quotient is pretty good, though again the most violent scenes are shot in super-shaky-cam mode which makes things a bit too frantic to be effective. Boyle also knows when to use silence to generate suspense.But near the end (I'll refrain from spoilers), the script becomes a bit too reminiscent of--of all things--Day of the Dead (the weakest of Romero's trilogy), when our heroes hole up with some military types who are a bit too macho for comfort.Also, in an odd technical choice, most of the movie appears to have been shot on digital video--but not 24P High-Def, merely plain ol' DV or DigiBeta, then transferred to 35MM. The image is cruddy looking on the big screen (though it might look fine on DVD), and whether this is an artistic choice or a budgetary one is unclear. Oddly, the very last scene is crystal clear and seems to have been shot on 35. Go figure.In all, it has its good points, but isn't the horror masterwork advance hype would have you believe. For really excellent British horror, check out Dog Soldiers instead.",28 Days Later...
458,elvisrivet-1,"A Horror Movie, with style.",8,6 October 2011,"28 days later is one of the best horror films I've seen a while, the plot of the film is simple but effective. The film has a slow pace to it, but it works well for the film. The movie while not scary is quite creepy in a lot of ways. The plot of the movie is about a virus that escapes from a British research facility, then 28 days later we meet our main character Jim, and well the movie just continues on from there, if I said anything else, it would spoil the movie for you.The story in this film works quite well, even though it's a simple one about a virus that infects people, it still works quite well. I don't think this film would have worked as well as it did, if it didn't such a great script. The film itself is slow paced, it takes time to develop its characters, instead of just killing them before we get to know them, and this is a nice change for once. This film isn't another mindless horror film, but a smart one that dares to be different. There are a few jump scares in this film of course, but they work rather well, and they're not the stupid, typical, crap that we usually see in horror films. The true horror behind this movie is not the virus itself, but the humans in the story, the humans that haven't been affected yet. I'm not talking about our main characters, but characters we meet later on in the film, who we think we can trust, but we really can't. The characters in this film are all developed in a great way that shows that a horror film can have characters that you actually care for, and not want to die. The film has a few surprises in it, that you won't see coming, now I won't tell you what they are, because that would spoil the movie for you. There's a scene towards the third act of the film that was disturbing, it's a scene involving our main characters, who just happen to have met up with the wrong people, this scene works quite well, because you're not expecting it all, you thought you could trust these people, but in reality you never could. I have to say that this scene was the best in the film, because of the way it was directed, the way the script work, but most of all because of the actors portraying the characters, I don't think the scene would've worked nearly as well, hadn't been for the actors portraying these characters.Now the acting in the film itself is actually quite good. Each of the actors, give their best performance in the film, even if they're just in the film for a few moments. I have to say though, that the best actor in the film would have to be Megan Burns, she did an amazing job with portraying her character Hannah, the performance she gave, was just such an amazing one. Now the rest of the actors all did great as well, but Megan Burns just stood out from the rest, she had that charm that the rest of the actors didn't have. But like I said, they all did well in their own way.Overall I would say watch this film, even if you don't like horror movies, I think you'd enjoy this one. It's not like every other horror film; it has a different feel to it.",28 Days Later...

For me the LTM in 28 Days Later was the opening scene with the Rage Monkeys in the primate research centre. There's just something so primal and feral about seeing those trapped and diseased monkeys in their claustrophobic imprisonment, smashing and screeching the plexiglass. And then given an opportunity, one monkey lashes out and savagely attacks a human. The monkeys get their ultimate revenge: to wipe out the human species that infected them with Rage in the first place.This is true terror featuring some Dumb ass Activists and a bunch of frightening monkeys (strangely I felt sorry and scared of the monkeys at the same time).My zoo experience with the chimpanzee will never be the same again.",28 Days Later...
462,tenebrisis,The Real Zombification Process!,10,17 October 2013,"a well-acted, well directed, and well written scary movie. Director Danny Boyle keeps the audience off-balance. Nightmarish quick cuts and digital video give the look of the movie a gritty, hallucinatory immediacy. Boyle also makes brilliant use of the empty artifacts, from the deserted London streets to a once-magnificent Gosford Park-style country house, now occupied by military, who eat rotting food around the table once used for glittering parties. Each character gets just one defining quality (idealistic Jim, tough Selena, stout-hearted Frank, ingenue Hannah), but that just adds to the sense of urgency -- we don't have time to get to know them, just as they don't have time to get to know one another....Desolate and empty London streets. An upturned bus. A solitary man's echoing 'Hello?' sends pigeons fleeing. Simple imagery, but stunningly effective.Danny Boyle can't be typed as a director. This guy is all over the board. He has a great feel for horror though, making very sure that he knows what really is scary. There is some blood, no doubt, but this isn't a spoon-fed easy horror, but more of an unseen menace. Even when the ""Infected"" are (quite literally) in your face, the camera is shaky and quick cuts are used to break up what you see and blur comprehension. Boyle also knows when to rely on action and when to slow things down. He never seems to be in a hurry, and allows the audience to get to know the characters on their own. Nothing is ever over-explained here at all, and any small lapses are acceptable due to the focus.",28 Days Later...

This is unusual, as I amtypically pleasantly surprised by movies that I have lowexpectations for. This is the first time I went into a film with lowexpectations only to discover my expectations were not lowenough. The best thing I can say is that the performance of MeganBurns as Hannah is truly wonderful. But I cannot recommend abad film for one good performance.",28 Days Later...
464,desh79,A modern classic.,9,19 October 2003,"Perhaps I'm a little biased. After all, this is set in the city I live and work in, and seeing Oxford Street and Piccadilly Circus, which I pass by every morning and which are usually teeming with crowds of people, completely empty was enough to send shivers down my spine. Usually when you watch a movie like this it's located in some nondescript Midwestern village, which makes it easy to detach yourself from the events unfolding on screen. But seeing them occur in the place you call home is something that gives it an entirely new sense of reality, and one I was previously unaccustomed to.Still, judging 28 Days Later entirely on its merit as a film, it's easy to arrive at the conclusion that it's a fantastic achievement, as well as a coming-of-age of sorts for director Danny Boyle; I can't say the MTV-inspired vanity of The Beach, or the self-consciously trendy posturing of Trainspotting appealed to me, and to my shame I initially expected 28 Days Later to be given a similar treatment. Thankfully, my fears proved unfounded, discarded straight after a opening sequence which is at once effortless and fearsome. The rest of the movie was a joy. A terrifying joy, but a joy nonetheless.It's true that sometimes minimalism can be more effective than overblown bravado, and it's definitely true for this movie. It's the scenes of complete silence which get to you the most; an entire metropolis empty. The grainy picture serves to add a documentary-style quality to the film, which makes the whole situation seem almost too real to bear. Definitely a wise choice to film this on digital video.You will occasionally meet people who thought 28 Days Later wasn't 'scary' or 'gory' enough. These are the same people who will tell you that 2001 was 'boring', or that Memento was 'confusing'. Ignore them. Others didn't understand the purpose of the second half, or were confused by its change of pace, feeling that it distracted from the movie as a whole. However, I personally regard the second half as very important because, as another reviewer pointed out, it makes a very succinct point: What is scarier, the end of the world, or having the world repopulated by maniacs? That, I think, is where the real Horror of 28 Days Later lies.28 Days Later, like the Romero zombie flicks of yore, is ultimately an allegory of the days we are living in, an age in which we are constantly confronted with violence by the media (much like the ape right at the start of the film), where violence begets violence, and humanity faces an uncertain future. I applaud Danny Boyle's bravery in making 28 Days Later because he undoubtedly took a big commercial risk when the majority of the cinema-going public might prefer escapism to words of caution. Remember, Rage is a human-made disease. Quite the allegory there.Like most great masterpieces of their time, 28 Days Later has been misunderstood by a considerable amount of people. I have no doubt it will go down in history as a classic, the one movie which perfectly sums up the confused era we are living in. And even if you didn't like it, it would be advisable to give 28 Days Later another chance; it's a haunting experience when looked at from the right angle. Danny Boyle has many years left in him, I hope he'll continue making more movies like this.",28 Days Later...

That's enough for me to call it a zombie film. It's also one of the best.From the powerful opening scenes, Boyle establishes a strong mood and creates a unique personality for the film. It was made with a small budget, but Boyle shows you don't always need a ton of money to make an effective film. You just need good ideas and a solid cast, which 28 Days Later has. Great score also.As with Sunshine, the script weakens itself a bit by going nuts in the final act. It's like the ideas ran out for one film, so they turned it into another until they had a complete film. The final act works on it's own, but I think I wanted something different.",28 Days Later...

It makes a heart pounding zombie movie that will make you sit up in your chair a little. By the way, I love how this movie starts. UK did a great job with this one and pretty much owns it. Even the sequel was good. This is worth a watch if you're into zombie movie but I'm sure if you are into them then you've seen this before and you're just going around randomly reading reviews on IMDb. More power to you.

467,DarrenHorne,Could have been so much better.,4,7 March 2005,"Danny Boyle moves into the horror genre with this zombie film with a twist. Combined with the writing talent of Alex (The Beach) Garland, this had the potential to be a fresh and contemporary take on the classic zombie horrors such as those by George Romeros. It fails miserably.Animal activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Centre and find caged chimps surrounded by a continuous video stream of war, anger and hate. Somehow the scientists have created a virus of pure rage, and these animals are infected with it. The well-meaning activists then free a chimp, which viciously assaults them, spreading the virus. 28 days later a bewildered Jim (Murphy) wakes up from a coma to find the hospital, and the rest of London, silent and empty. He wanders the deserted streets looking for any sign of life. But the people he comes across have been infected and are now rabid, blood thirsty, rage crazed zombies. Two other survivors (Huntley and Harris) come to his rescue and explain what has happened. They later join up with a taxi driver, Frank (Gleeson) and his daughter, Hannah (Burns). Together they set off for Manchester, which is the origin of a military radio broadcast offering sanctuary and a cure. There they meet Major West (Eccleston) who has brutal and pessimistic answers to their predicament.Images of a deserted London, wiped clean of humanity by a virus, are both terrifying and shocking, especially as the threat of biological terror attacks nag at all of our minds. The hellish visuals of Manchester consumed by fire snuff out any sense of hope and give a sense of post apocalyptic loneliness. The despair, that haunts every scene, increases when the characters reach the army ""safe haven"". The action scenes are few and far between, but they hit hard and fast, shattering the deathly silence with violent, heart-stopping gore fests. In between there is little suspense or tension, and the slow pacing leaves us craving that next attack. None of the characters are likable, due to awful dialogue and poor decision making. This isn't helped by Burns, whose terribly performance destroys any illusion of realism and constantly reminds us that this is just a film. Its only redeeming feature is its subtext of the fragility of civilised society and how quickly we become savage and cruel when there is no authority to answer to.An unsettling film that could have been so much more, especially when compared to the superb low budget werewolf film, Dog Soldiers. Top marks for effort though.",28 Days Later...
468,yodaschoda,Zombie Horror At Its Best!!!,8,29 March 2008,"It's not often that fans of the horror genre are treated to an original twist in the genre and it is even rarer to be treated to a truly scary and well done zombie movie. However 28 Days Later attempts to do just that and succeeds quite well in both regards.The story is set in England in where animal right activists break into a research facility in an attempt to free captive animals being used for medical experiments. Unbeknownst to them is the fact that these animals are carrying a highly dangerous and contagious disease known as Rage which is passed and contracted via bodily fluids and ultimately turns the infected hosts into blood thirsty zombies. 28 days after the animals are released the population of England is all but decimated by the disease and a few handful of survivors are clinging to life trying to survive the days and nights hiding from hordes of raging zombies. Our story begins when Jim, a patient in a hospital, awakens from a coma to find that the hospital and the city around him are vacant and destroyed. Jim, unaware of what has taken place over the past 28 days, sets out to discover what has become of not only his family but everyone around him. It isn't long before Jim encounters the blood thirsty monsters and his quest for answers is turned into a battle for survival. Along the way he makes contact with survivors and does his best to find his way in a terrifying new reality where anarchy and social rules are all but done away with.What I really liked about this movie was that unlike most horror movies where the main characters have virtually no common sense and spend their time splitting up and systematically being killed off one by one, the survivors in this movie realize that it is in their best interest to stick together in order to better their chances of survival and only leave each other's sides out of necessity. The fact that a ""logical"" approach was taken towards a genre which has often seen little logic truly makes this movie frightening, as even though they attempt to make logical decisions, they still sustain losses.What I also liked about this movie was the originality of the way in which the ""zombies"" originated that being via a disease/virus. This theme has since been copied many times over and with little shame in doing so.The acting was good and the fact that there were no big names added to the thrill of story since one never really knew who was going to survive and who was going to die, making every scene that much more tense.In the end, even if this movie never got the press it deserved and wasn't hyped to the level of other lesser movies of the same type, this remains one of the better movies in a genre sorely in need of better quality films.",28 Days Later...
469,hptmbedra,What is the reason for 7.7 ?,2,13 March 2014,"I've got to stop watching the ratings first. It's the best option to avoid the big movie let downs. Same story here, attracted by the ratings, I was looking forward to see ""28 days later"" impatiently.First minutes looked promising (except the monkeys situation). I like the sequences with individuals walking around while nobody else is there. The film looked cheap, but that is not a big issue from my point of view. Now, the biggest problem is the actual plot. There are way too many holes. Im prepared to take some amount of nonsensical scenes while watching this kind of movies but this film went over my limits. Among the most obvious (I am sure that one could count over one hundred idiotic sequences here but i will be brief): -The Selena is tough as nails from the beginning, girl with no problem killing her partner. She is prepared to let others in a trouble in order to survive but later on she turns out to be sensitive and pretty weak little girl. On the other hand, the weak and confused bicycle courier Jim becomes strong and battle experienced at the end and takes out the evil military squad by using his hands and unleashing the zombie in order to save the girls(what ???). And I almost forgot that when he finds a gun, he gets rid of it, because his hands are so much more effective against trained soldiers.-After saving Jim's life Mark tells him there is no electricity right? So how is it possible that 3 minutes later Jim watches a video tape? And where the light in the store came from? Did someone at least read the script before making this movie?-Why have all the people abandoned all protection clothes at the beginning? (Mark and Selena, Daddy, Soldiers, all of them were protected as we saw them first time) If the Daddy would have kept at least the goggles, he could live.-Jim continues to do stupid decisions. What was the reason he went inside the gas station? It was completely unnecessary and he was risking his life just to feel free or what. And why did they take the tunnel shortcut? The Daddy was inconsistent here. First time we saw him, he was a man dedicated to protection of his daughter, but now he was risking lives of his crew and almost got caught by zombies and then made fun of it.-Why the soldiers show up on the road block so late, I mean after the Daddy gets infected? Wouldn't it be better to say 'Hello' as soon as possible and avoid problems? While the infected were moving every time like freaks on a speed, I wouldn't have a hard time telling the infected and healthy apart.-Strange that the soldiers got crazy so early. The evac took place one month ago, that is a short time to become a psycho with sex as the only thing you care about.-Looking at the infected soldier on the chain I had the feeling it wasn't a good idea mainly if you walk through wrong door at night to take a leak. When they watched the infected soldier, they didn't keep any safe distance which should avoid landing infected blood on their faces.-Considering their survival situation, why were the soldiers wasting bullets while looking for Jim just to make sure he isn't for example in a tent over there instead of making few steps forward? The execution of Jim and sarge was stupid too. I think the major needed every man able to fire a weapon to increase their chances to survive.I have another 99 problems with that but let me skip it. Big let down considering the film looked good at the beginning and the promising ratings here.",28 Days Later...

471,The_Sandheaver,Boyle proves he can still surprise you,9,20 November 2006,"Danny Boyle has always been known for directing and producing several excellent masterpieces. Look at films such as Shallow Grave (1994) and Trainspotting (1996) for evidence. He proves that he has not lost his touch with this magnificent, harrowing film about a man named Jim (Cillian Murphy, Batman Begins) and his struggle to survive in the streets of London, which have been abandoned due to a plague known as ""Rage"". However, he soon finds out he is not as alone as he thought he was...This is easily one of the best drama films of the Twenty-first Century, and easily a cult British classic, and will always be remembered for the famous opening shots of the central character, Jim walking through the totally abandoned streets of London. It is just slightly disappointing in that the film seems to be clearly split into two halves. The first half is very intriguing, mysterious, thrilling and pretty scary, as we see how terrible things have become in London. However, the second half seems to completely lose the momentum the first half of the film developed, and it loses its edge, but there is still plenty of drama involved, and there are still some twists to the story left.""28 Days Later"" boasts a fantastic soundtrack, a top-notch crew (featuring the excellent Cillian Murphy, and the quirky Christopher Eccleston), and an intriguing plot which isn't completely predictable, and will cause a few shocks and screams as the story of a crippled world slowly unfolds. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a ""zombie"" film, more an exploration of human behaviour in the face of a huge, post-apocalyptic crisis, and the results aren't pretty.",28 Days Later...

473,juliomontoya2000,Great movie...with the finale affected with bad judgement (SPOILERS),7,27 October 2003,"I thought I was watching something that would become a classic. And I think this movie will somehow survive the test of time, but it could have been better. The filmmakers had the means in their hands, to do so. It's right there, on the DVD. I'm talking about the alternative ending, and a deleted scene that is rather an alternative scene that precedes the ending and that should have stayed instead of that in the final version. Even so, there would have remain some of the things that for me spoiled the movie towards the end, and converted it in another cheap slasher. We pass from a good science fiction-suspense movie, to a copy of any film that you can remember in which a killer is bloodily disposing of everybody in sight. But that alternative pre-ending, and the alternative ending, would have saved the day. The first one, because, among other things, the breaking and massive attack of many zombies have a better effect that just one doing all the havoc. And the latter, because it's more according with the general mood of the movie, and would have left us guessing. (Note: I'm satisfied with the alternate ending, but stripped from the second alternate ending -or continuation- that also comes in the DVD, which is also guilty of being Hollywood-esque). My guess is that the filmmakers were afraid of leaving the movie with no happy ending, and that was their biggest mistake. It's a shame, because it's all there, in the DVD. You just wish you could put the pieces in order. I gave it 7/10, because for seven tenths of the way, it's very good.",28 Days Later...

475,plu4085,Good genre movie that could have been better,7,22 October 2007,"It's interesting to see how popular a movie can get despite being derivative to the extreme. I guess this simply means that not enough people have yet seen George Romero's zombie trilogy, or classic British apocalypse TV such as Day Of The Triffids or the mid-70s ""The Survivors"". Making a good genre movie doesn't simply mean patching together all the familiar elements of the genre; you have to add a new twist or a new aesthetic to it. I can't say that ""28 Days Later"" does any of this.The first 1/3rd of the movie is excellent, gaining strength from the predictable yet very spooky images of a London completely empty from people. Cillian Murphy immediately wins the viewers sympathy, and carries the whole movie in a way that the director & writer should be quite grateful for. Unfortunately I think there is a slackening of pace and narrative grip in the middle third, which is the encounter and northbound car journey with another couple of survivors. The two female roles aren't properly developed, and I personally think the actors can't match Murphy & Gleeson... it really does feel like an old TV series here, briefly.The last third is very uneven; it covers familiar territory while making some interesting points; the direction is alternately confused and inspired, and there is a definite weakening from insufficient exposition of the soldiers as group and individuals. A lot is asked from the viewer here, and it seemed sloppy and B-movie like, compared to the first third.Basically, the movie tries to combine two powerful (yet familiar) themes into one, and a proper balance is not achieved. A different editing of the storyline would probably have improved things, but ultimately it is a case of a well-known and thus predictable story, whose first hour or so still works well thanks to atmosphere and acting, which cannot maintain its strength until the end. All in all, I was a little disappointed, but still found the movie worth watching.",28 Days Later...

Take ""Night of the Living Dead"" in early era TV color, excellent makeup and actors, and you'll get this movie. The writers kept the details of the how and why to a minimum and just let the virus infested humans take over.  There were enough subplots though to keep a good storyline going, this ranging from people learning to stick together and not leaving anyone behind through all the nasties to knowing just how much the living can be as dangerous as the infected. If I had any questions, it would be - did the virus kill them or just infect them, leaving them alive?  This was one of the whys they didn't answer, though I don't know which would be freakier.  Can I sit through this again???  Not unless I want a nightmare infested night of sleep, though I'll probably get that anyway after watching it the first time around.",28 Days Later...
477,blackwolf14016,"Pretty good, but could have been much better.",8,27 July 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ""28 Days Later""By James JohnstonAt it's heart, this is a basic ""The apocolypse is here"" kind of movie (A la ""The Omega Man""). Here's the basic premise <SPOILERS>:==============================================================> A group of Animal Rights activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Institute to free some monkeys being experemented on. Despite being warned by a terrified scientists, they unlock the doors, freeing the infected apes....28 days later (wink) Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital, after a long coma. He finds the hospital empty - no patients, no doctors, no one. After wandering around London, he is beset by murderous people that have been infected by the RAGE virus. Jim is rescued by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark, two survivors of the plauge. From there, they search for any other sign of life....==============================================================> The basic idea behind the movie is great. There have not been many movies recently using the ""World is Over"" premise, and it's good to see one.
There are also some nice deviants from traditional Apocolyptic Films: Instead of slow, mutated humans turned zombies, there are fast, insane, murderous humans who have been infected by RAGE. And when bitten, the victims are 'turned' in only 10-20 seconds.Another cool deviation is the lack of a 'total' apocolypse - England is completely infected, but North America and Europe remain uninfected (though there are hints that the virus may be spreading to those locations).
But the movie is far from perfect. There are some pretty huge plot holes in quite a few locations. And a few incidents don't make sense. For example <SPOILERS> when they find the military base and the 2 women are expected to sleep with the troops to 're-populate' the Earth. When they refuse, the soldiers try to rape them. This makes little sense - the soldiers KNOW that the other countries are still uninfected, but think that the world is over and they will die.Also, I find it hard to believe a group of animal activists could get through security into the Cambridge Institute - in an area so dangerous, there would have to be tons of guards and such.Those are 2 small examples that I can think of off the top of my head. There are many others.Another problem is the lack of 'monsters'. In a city of over a million, there must be hundreds of thousands of mutants. But you only ever see about 7-10 in a group. And you don't get many close-up shots of them, but I suppose that's to add to the scare factor.Also, appearantly the movie was filmed with Digital Film or something, instead of the standard film. Why, I don't know. I have no idea why they did this, the film appeared slightly 'fuzzy' in a few places, mostly in far-off shots.Another thing I didn't like about the movie was the lack of a back-story behind the 'apocoplyse'. We don't see the riots, the carnage, the military blockades, etc.Lastly, the ending was TERRIBLE. I saw it with 2 endings - which I will call the ""Good"" (all 3 signal a plane, the original ending) and the ""Bad"" ending (Jim dies from a gunshot would - Selena and Hannah continue to try and find an excape). I'll go from the ""Good"" ending, since the ""Bad"" one was pretty much just an attempt to get more people into the theaters. In the last scene, you see a military jet fly over the house, while the 3 survivors have made a giant sign out of sheets that says ""HELLO"". The jet sees them and radios back. This leaves the ending open enough to make the movie feel incomplete, while not open enough to warrant a sequel (at least not a good one). So you leave the theater feeling a little shafted.Well, enough with the bad. Let's start with the good.The acting is great - esp. because while these actors/actresses aren't really 'unknown', they arn't big-budget stars. Murphy does an especially great job as the confused and scared Jim.The Cinemotagraphy, despite the above film problem, is excellent. The shots of Trefalgar (sp?) square deserted, Big Ben not working, empty streets etc are fantastic. I have no idea how they managed to get those shots, but they are great.Although I didn't take much notice of it, the Score was great when I did. Nice moody music.And finnaly, the movie is indeed Scary. I saw it with my little sister and her friend, and they jumped 4 feet in the air when the infected jumped out. And you are on-the-edge of your seat through a good portion of it.This movie is a good watch, but It could have been better - throwing out the survivors fighting survivors part would have raised it from an 8 to a 9, as that part was totally pointless IMO.But non-the-less, a good movie that I reccomend whole-heartedly.James ""Black Wolf"" Johnston",28 Days Later...

It starts with trolleys being ridiculously choreographed through the checkouts and the 2 girls having great fun helping themselves to the chocolate, forget 5 minutes before, when they were nearly savaged by the sprinting zombies.And the ending?!

Nowhere before in the movie did it reveal that he had such stealth skills and the nerve to take out trained army personnel.28 Weeks Later was by far a superior film.

It is more stylish and less gory than the others but the director's commentary on the DVD I rented, together with the comments of ""scientists"" included therein, suggest a more serious, if not original, intent. The idea that animal rights activists might accidentally or intentionally release a pandemic is not implausible. Such an event could indeed be a disaster. The idea of a pandemic occurring on its own or as a result of a terrorist act is also not implausible. So why not make that movie? Not commercial? Instead this is just another rather dumb movie, rather than the cautionary tale it might have been. All the neat scenes of deserted cities cannot overcome that. Query: if the ""disease"" is so contagious and leaves it victims raging maniacs instead of dead, where did everyone go? If the infected can starve to death, why don't they attack each other? There are a lot of things to admire about the technique of this movie and the actors. If you like this kind of movie, don't watch the director's commentary.",28 Days Later...

Life's just not worth living without women to bang, and some poor slob was going to eat his own gun....UNTIL...dearest commander, the former Doctor, promised to find them women to gang rape. Yes, friends, who knew that the first rule of zombie and post apocalyptic survival in those first few death filled and insanely frightening weeks is having women handy to gang rape. And because it is sooooo very important, this secondary plot quickly overtook the primary plot, as these broken military soldiers ignored their own safety to their horrific demise, while trying to get their rape on. I just saw this movie (May 2015), and can't believe it actually won awards. It is absolutely round the bend ridiculous, and I'm glad I waited for the free viewing and didn't actually pay money to see it. Supporting this type of BS where a rape culture is not only OK, but overrides basic human survival, just encourages these nutters to keep making these idiotic films, so let's not do that.",28 Days Later...

It seems a common criticism that it is a poor zombie movie, I would add to the cacophony; and say it is also a poor shark movie and an even dumber pirate movie.It is a science fiction/horror/social thriller, that sticks together quite well if you take the time to think about it all at the end of the film.It does explore very familiar ground, but in a great way.  and it borrows much more from Romero's `The Crazies' than it does any of his zombie movies.Solid film making and one of maybe six actually scary movies I have seen in my life.",28 Days Later...

489,Bluegull99,starts fantastic and gies completely downhill later,3,22 October 2020,"I'm almost sorry I can give this only three stars, but what started so promising ended so ridiculous.
The beginning of the movie was quite impressive, the scenes with totally empty London with all its landmarks and symbols, all empty with that poisonous looking yellowish sky and the main character stumbling through the rubble in his hospital shirt (and I forgive them that it is totally unrealistic that someone who had severe head injury and was ina coma for four weeks just stands up and walks like a fit and healthy person. They showed that one way better in TWD when Rick tries to get up from his hospital bed and just falls down because his muscle power is simply gone after that long time and he needs some time to get some strength back) .
Also then, when he finds two kind of short term companions and they have to run and hide from the zombies, well done (and also here I forgive them that it is unrealistic that any kind of virus could spread in the body under 10 seconds like they showed it for the panic effect. If someone gets a droplet of infected blood into a wound in their arm, it would simply take a longer time until the infected blood is pumped through the body and arrives in the brain to make symptoms show - that can't happen within 10 seconds).
Then, when they meet the father and the daughter, also the almost claustropobic atmosphere in that multi-storey, I was still fixed in my seat and tense watching.
So then when looking for the source of the mysterious voice from the radio, the father dies and suddenly these soldiers turn up and take them with them to this kind of manor house.
And there it goes downwards, and quickly. So from being tense and at least halfway realistic the movie ends in the group of soldiers being sleezes who just want to have the two women, and our main character (still only past some weeks from his head op and previously being just a normal boy who certainly wasn't in the army or did any kind of self defence) turns into half naked Tarzan who outwits and kills many fully armed trained soldiers with automatic weapons - yes, alright! So this turn of events from decent to ridiculous comes rather quickly and I was just annoyed that they runied the movie like that. It almost seemed like one part was made by one director and screenwriter, and that last part was done by completely different people.
So, really a promising start of the movie with great scenery and atmosphere, and then a turn to total ridiculous Stallone style and logic movie.",28 Days Later...

More than a few scenes of real horror, with good characters and great direction. The infected definitely had a hand in the look of the recent remake of Dawn of the Dead, only they're better here.

493,Holitao,"Danny Boyle's tautly imagined `28 Days Later' is an ambitious zombie film more plausible than supernatural, more hysterical than scary, and more raw than gory.",8,1 July 2003,"Danny Boyle's tautly imagined `28 Days Later' is an ambitious zombie film more plausible than supernatural, more hysterical than scary, and more raw than gory.  Although the film is being marketed as a horror film, it bares truer resemblance to thrillers like `Outbreak,' based on the terrifying non-fiction, `Crisis in the Hotzone.'  Unlike George Romero's genre-defining visions of `Night, Dawn and Day of the (Living) Dead' trilogy, D. Boyle's zombies are not dead but rather terminally enraged.  Clearly the makers were inspired more by `Crisis in the Hotzone,' especially the way Ebola virus spread, and applied it in a zombie film. (In the final stages of Ebola infection, contaminated blood pours out from every orifices of victims' bodies while causing them to thrash violently and infect others through eyes, mouth, open wound and some even through air.)Wonderfully transparent Cillian Murphy plays Jim, a bicycle messenger who fell into coma just before the outbreak, wakes up to find all of London empty and left to discover the terrible fate of humanity.  Embracing the limited budget and digital video, D. Boyle champions inspired collaboration from his talented cast and cameraman, Anthony Dod Mantle.  Christopher Eccleston's insane Major Henry West and Brendan Gleeson's tenderly father Frank are excellent, and DV photography helps shape the film's creepy mood as well as freer application of digital visual effects.  John Murphy's aggressive score highlights film's implicit violence and psychological turmoil occurring throughout the film.  While `28 Days Later' is not as scary as G. Romero's Dead Trilogy, D. Boyle succeeds in breathing fresh life to the living-dead genre.  This one rates 8/10.",28 Days Later...
494,darkcybergeek,"""That was longer than a heartbeat."" - Jim",10,12 June 2005,"28 Days Later for me is the best zombie movie I've seen in a while (For me it was better than Dawn of the dead remake, Shaun of the dead, Resident evil 1 and 2). I mean the movie had this sense of desperation, and this realistic look that gave me the chills. I haven't seen a zombie movie that scared me this much, although it wasn't much of a zombie movie. It was more of a drama about this 4 people trying to survive in a world gone more mad than it is. Anyone expecting a Resident evil will be completely disappointed with this one. The script was excellent and i must congratulate the writers. The acting was very strong and i think they all did a hell of a good job, they were totally credible. The characters were very well develop and by the end of the movie you care about them which gives the movie more intensity. My favorite characters being Jim, Selena and Hannah...they were all very complex. The story well it wasn't that original really but as i said before it was played more differently than the usual zombie flick. The music/score was fantastic, it was very moody and definitively not usual for this type of movie. Great job! The suspense sequences were very intense especially the tunnel sequence still has me on the edge of my seat. For gore fans well this movie has plenty of gore and some really disturbing scenes (the eye popping scene....DISTURBING!) The great cinematography added more feel to the movie and the shots of London desolated were brilliant! The shots also were very creative and very beautiful indeed. And last but not least the ending, most people had a problem with it but i know i didn't i mean i think it was necessary in order for the movie's message to hit. Easily the best, scariest horror movie of 2003, well for me at least. (*My point of view of the movie was that every bad situation has a way out, and you should never give up.*)",28 Days Later...

I wish they would explain why. I got pretty creeped out. Resident Evil was a very similar plot, with a known actress/model as the star, and expensive CGI effects- but the editing and scare gags weren't crafted well enough to make me jump. 28DL didn't have all the pricey stuff, but made good use of editing, camera angles, and the power of suggestion to create a much better atmosphere of dread. The actors were also much much better.********Spoiler Alert*******
I think Boyle does a great job with what he had to make an effective thriller. First, I think developing the characters more than most horror flicks was the first step because you then care about what happens to them. Also, the fear of being chased down and torn apart is much more relatable then backing into a corner waiting for the zombies to lumber over and surround you. That reminds me of a scene in Resident Evil when the team gets surrounded by slow moving rotten faced zombies. For some reason it didn't creep me out. But when Jim pleads for Selena to wait for him as they race up the flight of stairs whilst pursued by infecteds that you really don't even get to see, my stomach was in knots. I loved the Selena and Jim romance!!! I knew she liked him because she was mothering him so much- in a brusque way but nonetheless. The bossy little comments like:"" don't get perishable food, Jim. Where are you going, Jim? Why, Jim? We already have enough food, Jim. Why didn't you tell me you were sick earlier, Jim?"" or things of that nature. Her mother role for hannah took me by surprise though. I'm glad it happened but wished there was more development to justify it. The pace slowed down however when they reached the military base. Its not that I didn't like it, but it just didn't seem as suspensful. The third act gave me more of a ""looming danger"" feeling. I knew those soldiers were gonna try something with Selena when they were driving back and one of them was eyeing her. I was afraid that it was gonna get really ugly because I hate rape scenes. When they started tearing off her clothes I started bracing myself to see something more disgusting than the last scene of Hannibal. I can't believe that Boyle said they toned down that scene after the original got a really bad reaction from test screenings. How far did they go? I know Naomie said she felt really bad about filming this scene. Even though its just acting, its still humiliating to have your clothes torn of by a buncha guys you don't really know. I think that the first alternative ending (which was the original one), would be more realistic. For heavens sake, he got shot point blank in the gut! But the theatrical ending would make more sense in the context of the story. I thought Jim symbolized hope and optimism. It's also a nice motif to end with: he wakes up on a bed, starting a new life. I am so glad they didn't even produce 'radical alternative ending.' It was just beyond stupid. Total blood transfusion? Jim sacrificing himself. How truly lame. Boyle should be embarrassed that he even came up with that storyline. About the digital video quality- it didn't have to look that way. Robert Rodriguez uses the same medium and his pictures look good- almost like 35mm. In 28 DL the grittiness works most of the time, but some shots are just atrocious. the worst are the closeups with Priv. Mitchell with Selena in tow, listening apprehensively to Jim moving about in the attic. They look like they used a cheap flashlight for lighting.",28 Days Later...

It feels like watching a dream!Acting sucks and Dialogues are so lame that it's hard to get attached to a character.Movie is full of senseless plots.A stupid piece of junk taxi car becomes a monster truck and drives over other wrecked cars in the tunnel like piece of cake, is completely senseless.Only one person survived in hospital.

505,PoochJD,"Good, but flawed!",7,24 October 2002,"""28 Days Later"" is an Ebola-virus type thriller, not too dissimilar to the UK TV mini-series ""CHIMERA"". Set in a post-apocalyptic, semi-futuristic time, we follow two survivors as they travel through London, to locate other people who may still be virus-free.The film is good, but flawed. The first third of the film is exceptional, without a doubt: the sheer terror and brutality of what happens when Man tries playing at God! It's graphic, uncompromising, and not-at-all for the squeamish or sensitive! If you think a horror movie won't make you jump, be prepared! The final third, is also very good. However, the middle third, and the ""ending"" are pretty terrible.The main problems, are down to the lack of empathy and feelings we have when the hero's meet-up with a gang of army officers, led by Brit-actor Christopher Eccleston. The men are essentially parodies of all the worst aspects of masculinity: the propensity for violence; the need to see women only as sexual objects; the laddishness. Yet, we don't really care if they make it out alive or not. Eccleston's performance is okay, but not his best, which is a real shame. His upper-class accent doesn't fit with the ""Squaddie"" character he portrays. A shame, especially when he is Manchester born and bred, and the Army squad are camped in Manchester.As for the ""ending"", it really negates the film as a whole, and I suspect that 20th Century Fox may have demanded or forced the creators of this movie to tack it on, despite their protests. Even if that isn't the case, the ending ruins everything you've just watched in the preceeding two hours.Ultimately, the virus isn't explained enough. We're told it was created, it exists, and has now escaped, but little else. As such, the nature of the way it can/cannot infect others, is left for audiences to accept unquestioningly.As a horror film, it's good. As a British horror film, it's a real shocker. But as a complete movie, it's let down by the saggy middle part. Some trimming of this section, would have made a really tight, and raw movie. Maybe, reducing the running time to 100 minutes, perhaps. Whilst by no means a long film, as it stands, some of you may well come-out of the auditorium, feeling a little frustrated at how the film pans out. A good attempt, but not the ""finest British horror film ever made"".",28 Days Later...
506,House_of_Gonzo,Could have been so much better,5,25 October 2003,"Spoilers includedI just watched 28 Days Later last night and must say it could have been better. I have lots of complaints about the plot and story. I believe that there are many questions about the story that just don't make sense. For instance, how can someone be injected with rage?  And if were really possible how are you going to infect someone else?  Rage is an emotion. Now, I will admit that there were scary and intense parts, but the story could have been touched up better. Some of the characters at the end of the film were also not written well. I am refering to the soldiers.  If they were true soldiers they would be more concered with the well being of other humans that have not been infected.  Not raping the only women they have seen in almost a month.  Now yes, I'm sure they were ""in the mood"" but give me a break.  The movie was shot entirely with DV which makes it a better looking film than most Hollywood films.

508,keith96778,28 days later ... you forget this movie.(SPOILERS),5,23 August 2003,"This is a very ordinary film with no original contribution to the genre. The camera work is interesting at times, but the concept and script are straight out of the vault (of hackneyed and overworked ideas).  It has no real identity of its own to speak of and, thus, is hardly worth speaking about.The movie lacks the hard edge that might have given it some distinction. It has some grit, but it is inconsistent.   Scenes are painstakingly manipulated to set up suspense that never materializes, such as when the females are forced to dress up so they can be more fun(?), attractive(?) or what(?) to rape by the horny little soldiers.Long before fashion becomes an issue, the film betrays itself with contrivances and inconsistencies in the world it seeks to create.  When poor addle-brained Jim stumbles about a deserted London, for example, there is nary a clue as to the ""rage"" that decimated the population.  Meanwhile, Selena and her original companion are scrounging out an existence in a city with grocery stores filled with food. Shortly after, Selena, who would leave anybody who falls behind, skips off to visit Jim's mum and dad for no apparent good reason.  Nearing the end, Jim is handcuffed then mysteriously not handcuffed so  he can rescue the ladies.  The director didn't even bother with an implausible account of that fete.  At least he could have inserted a bubble over Jim's head thinking ""What good luck I am Houdini's great-grandson.""  It wouldn't have detracted from the film in the least.   The list goes on and on.  Even classic horror has a plot hole here and there, but never so many, so deep.It really wouldn't have been hard to tighten up the logic of the film to give the treatment some integrity.  Filmakers seem to not bother with details these days. But why bother when consumers don't demand it?If one suspends disbelief and good taste, this film can be tolerated. Otherwise, if you're lucky, 28 days later .... you forget this movie.

509,breakingthefragile,Zombies are an inspired horror movie monster again.,8,1 May 2012,"Adapting zombie horror to modern times by completely turning zombie monster movie establishments and rules on their rotting heads. Zombies are now fast as cheetahs, and even more terrifying predators than they were before. Giving the decomposing corpse of the idea of zombies a modern horror style make-over. A 21st century atmosphere rich with decay and disease supports the spin-tingling currents of fear and suspense running through this flick, and it all comes together by displaying true and beautiful humanity through superbly acted characters that you can generally care for. This does so much more than properly modernizing one of the most classic of horror monsters, and goes as far as to place them in a movie that has better gore and action than anything like Resident Evil, but uses them as something more than just shooting material in mindless modern action/horror such as Resident Evil, and contains what those movies do not, integrity and vision within the confides of modern horror cinema. Something that has been long missed and is much needed now more than ever, and 28 Days Later has it while still beating out its relatives (that are only concerned with thrills) at their own game. If you're looking for intelligent horror, or even if you're a zombie-like moviegoer craving only action and blood and guts, rejoice! Because this movie has enough brains to go around for everyone, for all reasons and uses.",28 Days Later...
510,cmcphee1965,Cliche storyline and directing,4,23 November 2020,"The story itself is not much, so it's not really worth summarizing, but my main issue with the movie is the absurd camera work. It's that typical haphazard, hard to follow jerky motion that is, I guess, designed to make you feel that some really crazy action is going on. But all it does for me is make it hard to see what the hell is really happening. If you make a good action scene, the LAST thing you want is to jerk the camera around and make it a mess. If you can't make a good action scene, and you have to rely on frantic camera movements, then maybe you should be in a different profession.",28 Days Later...
511,JerryCantrell,"An excellent horror film, should not be forgotten",10,28 December 2004,"Danny Boyle (director of Trainspotting) was the last person I would expect to see directing a horror movie. Especially a good one. Scratch that. A great one.Shot primarily in digital camera, the movie follows a man (Jim) as he struggles to figure out just what in the world is going on after he wakes up in a Hospital and finds the world apparently devoid of all life. Stumbling around he finds his way into a church where he finally finds signs of life. Unfortunely those people he does run into in the church are infected with ""rage"" a virus released on accident by Animal Activists who did not heed the pleas of a scientist to not release a batch of chimps from their cages due to a highly infectious disease they carry.From there we see Jim meet up with a few other survivors and as the film goes on, we find that the infected are not the only problem Jim and his acquaintances have.Shot like a documentary the film works on many levels. It scares and at times flat out disturbs the viewer. It's not a horror movie with a ""zombie"" like theme used for an action platform. Instead it's a gritty account of survival, at times in it's most primitive form.The scene where Jim is shown walking around the vacant city is brilliant. The music for the scene really sets a tone of emptiness and curiosity. One of my favorite scenes of all cinema. Ever.What this film does, is show a tale of survival. The gore is not too intense, and is instead left to your imagination (i.e: Psycho, Halloween). It works that way, and Alex Garland manages to work fear, wit, and humor into his script in almost perfect harmony of each other.28 Days Later is no ""zombie"" flick. Yes, the infected act like Zombies, but the movie really aims to show that when no rules are in place, we can be our own worst enemy. Great film. Do not miss it.5/5. Perfect.",28 Days Later...

513,animalfan92,Freakin' Awesome,10,2 September 2008,"28 Days Later was such a cool movie. It was a different take on a zombie movie, in the sense that it was more explained. It had fantastic characters and actors and the plot wasn't boring. It's one of those movies that when I watch it I'm not comparing it to others- it's too good. I'm also the type of person who needs an explanation for everything, so it was nice to know why they were zombies and that they could actually starve to death. I guess I liked it because it takes place in London, which I know and don't know. The emptiness of it is great, the feeling that they are truly alone and there is such little hope when London is completely abandoned. You don't see that too much, no movie portrays this feeling of emptiness as well as 28 Days Later did. It was a do or die situation for the characters, which made it extremely a better movie. Besides, it's just soo cool.",28 Days Later...

The soundtrack only added to the feeling of loneliness that the film brought forth. The whole film was very intense and I found myself often on the edge of my seat. I praise Danny Boyle's choice to steer away from ""Hollywood"" norm and create something different. After walking through a gauntlet of posters advertising sequels it's refreshing to have something original to watch!",28 Days Later...
515,kevin86,Dodges many of the faults that make most horror movies fall flat.,10,28 June 2003,"Nowadays, truly scary movies are hard to come by. People are subjected to a lot of WRETCHED horror films that contain poor character development, lousy dialogue, cheap thrills, and pointless plots. Most of the horror movies that have been released lately really don't offer much of anything to be honest.
With that in mind, one might assume that ""28 Days Later"" would simply be another one of those pointless/tedious films that slowly diminishes the intelligence of its viewers with poorly written stories chock full of mindless gore.Well, I can honestly say that; in my opinion, 28 Days Later has managed to dodge many of these great faults that are usually very common in the horror genre. The film-makers have succeeded in bringing to the audience a terrifying story of primal violence and desperate survival in an apocalyptic world. The film is primarily a story showing the brutal aftermath of a deadly epidemic known as the ""Rage"". Those infected have entered into a state of blood-lust, driven only by a hunger for the flesh and blood of those who have not yet been subjected to the virus. We are shown only clips and portions of the chaos that had followed the outbreak. Massive riots and stories of barbaric killings are told through newspaper clippings and explanations given by other survivors. All of this and much more sets the tone of the movie from the start. Bringing us in immediately.
But beyond all of this is a simple tale of human nature. 28 Days Later captures the realistic circumstances of survival, highlighting the various ways people cope with things in such horrendous times. Throughout the course of the film, we come across about 13 non-infected people with entirely different personalities and entirely different means of survival. They all have their own opinions on how to survive, and they've all learned to cope with the conditions in their own way. its this aspect of the movie that really caught my interest.Was the movie flawless? No not at all. NO MOVIE IS FLAWLESS. But like a few other memorable cinematic experiences, 28 Days Later presented something new. It was gritty, weird, wild, and creepy. Just the right mix to give us a break from the typical/cruddy box office ""hits"" Hollywood coughs up every month. 10 out of 10. Full points for being the most entertaining movie I've seen in theaters so far this year.",28 Days Later...
516,sbyers77,"Sorta Scary, sorta long, sorta leaves things unanswered.",5,28 June 2003,"This movie would have been alright, had it done several things. *Minor Spoilers, but wont make too much sense unless you've seen it*First of all it would have to explain WHY exactly the infected people did not find enough rage to kill each other. This fatal flaw kinda ruined the whole movie. Also, who is our main character? Where did he come from? Did the hospital not cure him of infection, or why else would he be hooked up to IV and bleeding? And probably the most frusturating of all is where the title comes from, why does he pass out for 28 days at a time? And why did they find it nessisarry to continually show him naked? So many questions, no answers.As to being ""the scariest movie I ever saw,"" as someone explained to me before I saw it... sorry no, there were only a few things that made me jump at all, and worse of all, one of which was a caralarm!The movie was also quite long at 112 minutes, which felt more like 130-140. For a ""scary"" movie, was not too appealing, after the first hour and a half you start to wonder how much is left.The movie was quite chopy in sequence. It was more like 8 or 9 short stories built on top of each other, with no major goal behind them all. Basically the movie was a camelback of minor conflics and minor resolutions with no overseeing goal at hand. Even if the movie said ""lets get out of here [England]"" would have been better than no real plot besides staying alive for a few more hours.Once the end finally comes around, it ""leaves you hanging,"" or as I like to call it, ending without explaining ANYTHING from the movie, no resolution for our characters, the virus, the plane, or the entire island of England. This movie pretty much gave-up at the end, it felt like, ""yeah, we dont know where to go from here, so we are gonna stop while we are behind, thanks for your ten bucks.""",28 Days Later...
517,SILV3R,The UK perspective,9,8 October 2002,"Rating: TBC (lets face it, its an 18 and then some) Stars: Mainly unknowns, and Christopher Eccleston Theme: Horror/Sci-Fi/Drama Language/Nudity/Violence: Very bad language, huge amounts of violence (once sexual) When Hollywood made The Beach they gave it the usual Hollywood spin. 28 Days later is what happens when you actually let Alex Garland write the screenplay. Set in a quasi post-apocalyptic world, a virus has been let loose on an unprepared public by ill-judging but well meaning animal rights activists. It is made perfectly clear in the prologue that this is not a film for the weak of heart, or even the moderate of heart. And even the strongest stomachs can expect to be tested.The Vanilla Sky sequence around a deserted London is one of the creepiest things you will have ever seen on screen. Not only will it encourage the tension and dread that the film is trying to draw out of its unsuspecting audience but it will force you to try and work out how on earth they managed to shut the entire city down. Until this point the movie has been relatively slow, but this is all about to change as the story really kicks off. It would be unfair to the film to reveal much more of the plot after this point, and even more unfair to the potential audience.The cast is made up of unknowns and faces that you are sure you have seen before somewhere, but just can't place. Whether this confusion was intentional in the casting or not I'm not sure, but it certainly enhances the overall sense of displacement. Christopher Eccleston's appearance later in the film awards him with the entrance that all actors would like. Unfortunately he spends most of his role looking slightly embarrassed about being in such a trivial movie, only once enjoying himself as he torments a captive. There will not be any best actor Oscars winging their way to the cast of this movie, but they're acting ability isn't really what the movie is about. They are all perfectly acceptable as their characters, with Jimmy being the standout performance. This is a mood movie that is designed to mess with you head but not allow you enough time to work out the answers.28 Days Later is essentially I high budget, intelligent and deeply scary horror film in the vain of many a 1950s B movie. This is not Eight Legged Freaks (Arach Attack), but comparisons could be made. It is darker, less humorous (although not devoid of humour), and definitely British. The main difference between this and the last decade worth of horror movies is just how possible it really is. This is not a spoilt brat slasher or alien invasion movie, this is a tangible danger that is no leap of imagination to consider real.Mark: 9/10Who to go with: Someone big and strong to hide behind.",28 Days Later...
518,Stevieheuge,Makes the very best of a small budget.,7,6 October 2004,"*review contains spoilers*Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later it without a doubt the best British horror film of recent times. It has some genuinely chilling moments, some great subtle humour, and best (and most importantly) of all, its a pretty original piece of work.'Jim', played by up and coming Irish actor Cillian Murphy emerges from a coma in a London hospital. he is alone. He goes out into the corridor - he is still alone, and the place is trashed. He goes out into the street, and by jove, the whole of London is completely deserted... And its great! Immediately the audience is asking ""what the hell is going on here?"" Its something we're just not used to - never before have we been struck with such scenes in a British setting, and it is truly startling.Unfortunately for Jim, the answer to the current state of his country, is that it has been obliterated by a virus that infects and overcomes its victims in seconds with 'rage', turning them into almost unstoppable violent monsters...The first hour of the film is great, and Boyle uses every second of his deserted London footage perfectly, building an incredibly creepy atmosphere, but its even in these early scenes that we see that the lack of budget is apparent - there are no bodies in the streets, it all seems just a little too TOO empty. However, this does add to the isolated theme even more.The film slows a little as it makes its way through the second act. The whole movie was shot on digital film, which has been tweaked to give the film a grainy, moody look, and as much as this works, it does not disguise the fact that the film begins to lose its way a bit. As the characters trudge on in search of hope, the continued isolation of the two main characters becomes steadily more uneventful, rather than unnervingly lonesome. Although thats not to say it doesn't have its moments - Boyle gives us a few little set pieces in the moments to follow, but they just don't seem to do the premise justice - if all of Great Britain has been decimated by this virus, there should be rampaging hoards of infected crashing at them at every turn - but no-one, NO-ONE is around!Its a shame though, because everything that could have made the last half of this film great, would cost lots of money. If you don't have it, you cant make it. Due to this, and a bad turn in story, the last third of the film descends into the unwanted, the unbelievable, and it just seems like such a waste. Let me explain:The infected humans in this film are just that - people who are overcome with a virus. They are not undead, thay are not zombies, as the director has stressed on many occasions. This means they sprint after you, not hobble like a pensioner with typhoid. One adversary is as dangerous as many. Most of the chills come from this fact, because as isolated as the survivors seem, what may be around the next corner could devastate everything. Whenever a few of the infected are on the screen, the tension is cranked up to breaking point - its edge of the seat stuff.So why, why, WHY in the last third of the film are these brutal, scary enemies replaced by a much more idle threat? A few cockney soldiers! NOOOO! We almost completely forget about the infected masses, and are tossed into a completely new world where the bad guys are soldiers who all seem to have lost their minds, and have decided the only useful thing left to do is to rape a woman and a 13 year old girl. Useless. But wait, this shows us people we don't like! Baddies! I wonder what will happen to those guys...Thankfully however, the final segment of the film makes up for it, all hell breaks loose before your eyes, people get mauled, blood is spilled, and it seems like a fitting payoff that leaves you satisfied with what has gone before.One more gripe however. The acting throughout is very solid. From everyone. Except Megan Burns, who plays Hannah. She is young, fair enough, but her performance is so incredibly bad, she almost wrecks every single scene she is in, its ridiculous. There is no way Danny Boyle could have been satisfied with her acting, and there simply MUST have been something preventing him from replacing her.Still though, all in all, the film works. Its unique, its scary, and it raises the bar significantly for bigger budget British films. Lets hope we get more of the same in the future, only without Megan Burns.7/10. SP",28 Days Later...

Well, tough script work ahead...",6,10 February 2009,"As funny as it may sound, this movie reminded me the case of another infamous film trying to combine two half-stories to make them match into a solid one and falls short : ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"".First, Max finds problems in a post-apocalyptic city in the desert, then gets cast away and discovers a children colony living in caves. Then, the film has to move on the best it can and the script wreckage begins. Same with ""28 days later"" : The first part is a decent usual 'horror/survival/road trip/bound of trust between characters' drama that works pretty well with suspense, fear and tension, plus a touching background of sadness and even despair Then the second part begins with some military unit that makes us all think about ""Lord of the Flies"" - and the audience might feel a bit cheated on at that point, for that infamous ""Solution for Infection"" message is in fact a let down from the very first minutes the survivors join the group.And for the third act, the script writer has to prove his brain muscles out to make the two half-stories fit  and fail he does. In order to make the story move on, illogical twists keep going : the hard-boiled girl who once killed her only friend with a machete blade because he got infected now becomes a poor wining-crying doll; the young lady who needed care and protection simply vanishes from all pieces of dialog and the skinny-and-shy-and-uncompetitive bicycle courier turns out to become a stealth commando expert who can defeat 5 or 6 trained military men loaded with weapons. Not to mention an eerie upbeat happy ending where many viewers thought there would be a 'Planet of the Apes'-like strong and unforgettable conclusion.

Large parts of this film are so utterly devoid of imagination that only my faint hopes of watching the deeply irritating leading man suffer a hideous and hopefully prolonged fate kept me watching. Director Danny Boyle has a strong background in television and this film looks like a TV movie shot on low budget DV. The plot draws heavily on ""Survivors""; an old BBC post-apocalyptic drama series that routinely displayed far more imagination and invention than this rather feeble effort. The cast are adequate for the undemanding roles they are required to play and the story unfolds strictly by the numbers.

Anyone wishing to make a successful horror movie, can learn much from classics like Night of the Living Dead, Carnival of Souls, Night of the Demons, to name a few.

There are numerous scenes where the infected just seem to be concerned about uninfected people, and they congregate in groups.  Also in the beginning, they 'walk' around London surely it would be far far safer to travel by car.

The characters say things that would be said and the screams feel like they are coming from terrified people.

With no power, no phones, and no sign of any help, the survivors band together and live to escape, any way they can.28 Days Later took this once tired genre into new territory in a blistering, no-holds bar kind of way, showing us what it might be like were zombies to be real. However, you won't hear the word zombie uttered once in the film, as they are simply called ""The Infected"" here. The film's stark imagery, realistic undertones, well-drawn characters carried by brilliant performances, and a never-ending sense of foreboding and dread, created a formula of zombie's films which took this genre to a new place. Suddenly, the fall of the world to the rise of the undead became seemingly possible, and we met characters who weren't just two-dimensional idiots posing as zombie food waiting to be picked off, but rather real people, with genuine emotions and motivations, trying to make sense of life after most had died.Highly recommended.",28 Days Later...

But I don't think that anyone will care after 10 years).First of all: The first half of the movie has more covert advertising, than...advertisement! 3 times in a row, they show or talk of Pepsi. I really was astonished that no one said: ""Ah, Pepsi! This really let's me forget about all those infected...better than Coke!""Second: How come, that nearly everyone is dead, but still, there are no corpses on the street. No one! Did they all decided together to walk into building to die?3rd: On the streets there is complete chaos and even buses are turned. But then the group walks into in a shop (which is not even closed) and everything is neat and tidy like provided a few days ago. Not one cereal box is lying on the ground! (And again: so many ads!)4: Why should only the UK be infected? Simply, why? And why is there just one guy who says that, and then no one speaks of it again, we see no sign that this is true (except of the plane at one point, but no further explanations).5: Why is it totally OK for Selena that Jim killed every solider in a very brutal way (pressing his thumbs in the eyeballs of this one dude)? Especially when this virus is making everyone violent?6: The part where Frank got's infected was just plain stupid. Instead of waiting 1 minute he kicks a wall and get's blood in his eye...why? It would be OK, if he got bitten, but with this way of getting infected it just looked, like they wanted some drama.7: Did someone say forced drama? Well how about the ""Kill the boy-scene""? He walks into a burger store AFTER they looted the shop aforementioned because he want's a cheeseburger? Does he really think, that these things just lay around for him? It looked to me, like that he really wanted to see dead bodies. Or kill himself, because he literally shouted ""hello"" in there. What did he think, he would find? I really think, that the part with killing the boy was just in there to forcefully cram drama in us.8: Last part. They just escaped the mansion after all the soldiers tried to rape the girl's...next thing they do: draw the attention of a military jet to them. Not enough rape, eh?",28 Days Later...
535,dave_472,"Wow! A horrifying, survivalist-type thriller that is GREAT",8,20 June 2005,"This film was fantastic. I was expecting something along the lines of a combination of ""Resident Evil"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" but this is quite different from that description. Yes, it involves a terrible disease that leaves its infected victims as blood-sucking, mindless zombies who pray on the not-yet-infected and yes, it involves a group of survivors who are left together to fend for themselves. But it is quite different from Resident Evil (no comic-book or video-game type plot here and no explosives or automatic weapons) and is a much more thrilling ""survivalist-type"" film than ""The Day After Tomorrow"".An awful virus is spreading through the streets and cities of Great Britain. Soon nearly everybody is affected by this deadly disease that turns its victims into zombies, who are quite noticeable and different from normal people due to their odd/rapid body movements, their blood red eyes, foaming at the mouth, and their inability to communicate with normal people unless they are trying to bite them. A small group of survivors manages to stay alive and uninfected, but not for long. Eventually, they one-by-one fall victim to the awful disease and the remaining survivors have sealed a pact that involves them instantly killing any member of their group that has become infected, not to endanger those who are still alive and not yet zombies. As the survivors count their time left, they attempt to make it to a British military base near Manchester where they believe they will be safe. They do eventually make it there, but what can stop zombies (who are mindless, blood-thirsty and have nothing to lose) from invading an army base? Are the survivors and British soldiers safe? Or will they soon become zombies themselves?This film is quite scary and exciting and perhaps one of the best British films that I have seen from modern times...

But when you step outside to find your city trashed with no one around except for flesh eating monsters. You begin to feel terror.""28 Days Later.."" is the story of Jim (Cillian Murphy). A man who wakes up from his coma 28 days after a terrible virus was accidentally unleashed on Great Britain. The virus is very contagious and just the slightest bit of infected blood can infect you and within 10 seconds after the blood is in your body, you lose control. The virus enhances rage and all the infected are in a permanent state of rage running at incredible speeds after anyone they see.Jim wakes up to find the streets of Britain deserted and it wasn't till he was chased down the streets by infected that he realized what had happened. Jim then meets Selena (Naomie Harris), a survivor who helps Jim to safety. Then, Jim and Selena come across Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter, Hannah (Megan Burns). Frank says that he has been listening to his little radio constantly since the outbreak and reports of the virus having spread to Paris and NY. Frank also says he has heard broadcasted ads that the military are taking in all non-infected people and that meeting them at a certain point will ensure their safety.The rest of the film chronicles the group's travels to the military base and what happens there after. The film's main moral comes into perspective towards the end of the film where safety isn't always what you think and how in desperate situations like this, humans will do anything to satisfy themselves.Not very scary, but very horrific makes ""28 Days Later..."" one of the best horrifying films to date.

What makes a Zombie is something that isn't human but looks it trying to have you for lunch. Enough said.Much as I dislike ""I'd rather clean the cat box"" human-on-human violent movies, I count zombie films as escapism (or at least I hope that they are).This one has the intensely claustrophobic, terrifying atmosphere of the best of the genre. I actually shrieked and leaped off the couch during one scene the first time that I saw it and this is rare for someone accustomed to horror films who usually makes jokes about monsters needing dental work.The concept is fresh and very clever and the execution is commendable.

This horror film actually has the audience caring for the characters and keeps a good suspense trough out the film. What makes this film special from other zombie films is that the ""zombies"" are actually infected humans. There is no re-animate from the dead and the infected... Can run.

539,redmaxdrive,No Actual Zombies Here!,9,29 January 2009,"To be frank, this movie scared me *BLEEP*less. I thought it would be in the same vein as the Resident Evil films, and for the most part it was. An empty city, a virus running amok, people dropping like flies every other minute: a true recipe for fright in my book. But I wish people would stop referring to this movie's creatures as zombies. And now I would like to clarify something that I don't think anyone quite believes: There are no actual zombies in this movie! The virus carriers in this film aren't really dead, despite not eating or drinking anything for weeks and spewing blood by the gallon. A true zombie is a dead body that has been reanimated by any number of off-the-wall methods, while the creatures here are still alive, the unfortunate victims of a biological accident.Now that I've gotten that off my chest......I enjoyed this movie very much. For me, the bulk of the horror came from the realization that something like this could happen in real life. Maybe not on such a gruesome scale, but it's still inside the realm of possibility. And now I bid you all a fond farewell.",28 Days Later...

541,timskelly,Environmentally Friendly Zombies,8,28 June 2003,"Despite being very intense, ""28 Days Later"" is a zombie movie you can take your (less sensitive) friends to. It's an odd film, in that it isn't terribly odd at all. It is photographed on video and shot and edited in a contemporary, slick manner that creates the illusion of immediacy. Still, in it's own way, it is nearly as chaste as a Hammer film. Not too surprising given England's ""Video Nasties"" laws, which could be partly the motivation for changing the zombie rule book -- a zombie picture for a country that doesn't look kindly on zombie pictures. In fact, as has been mentioned elsewhere, ""28 Days Later"" has less in common with the undead and more with the novel (not the film) ""Day of the Triffids.""Having circumvented Britain's tender sensibilities, and having added some new editing and filming tricks, Danny Boyle does an excellent job of recapitulating the best of George Romero, including his earliest horror effort, ""The Crazies."" I'm not saying this as a criticism, though it does remove some of the film's potential novelty. It is unlikely that the plot will surprise you or leave you, like Romero's films did, with that desire to have your soul cleansed with bleach. The real rage that is missing in ""28 Days Later"" is George Romero's apparent loathing of human beings in general and the stupid and angry in particular -- the sense that everyone is a zombie, bitten or not.",28 Days Later...
542,Rarb,"Good premise, poor execution.",8,24 November 2003,"This film starts out well: `activists release crazy virus-ridden monkeys from a laboratory', followed by `guy wakes up in deserted city 4 weeks later'. Yes, the footage of him wandering around London completely on his own is very impressive and the soundtrack ain't bad either. Oh, and that Naomie Harris  she's got a decent part and she's a strong actress. But that's about it. After meeting up with the father/daughter pair it's clear that the writer, the director and anybody else responsible for this production didn't have a clue what to do next. So they started making it up as they went along. They practically admit as much, on the DVD, in their commentaries over the top of the movie and the various deleted scenes and three (yes three!) alternate endings. A lesson to be learned here: decide roughly how your film will end before you start filming.*** Spoilers ahead ***There's a few flaws in there too:1) Surely there'd be a few bodies lying around in the streets  after all we see a double-decker bus on it's side  didn't anyone get killed during that incident?2) Selena's hair always looks like it's just been washed and blow-dried  kinda strange given there's no hot water or electricity!3) Why, oh why would they drive into a tunnel when all the bridges seem to be deserted? And driving over the top of a pile of crashed vehicles? I don't think so!4) An untouched grocery store  don't the infected folk get hungry too? No matter how filled with rage they are  they still gotta eat! And that place looked kinda nicely lit!5) As they drive by the windmills (which, incidentally are actually located in Cornwall) they are on a dual carriageway  as they drive away they are suddenly back on a 3-lane motorway.6) The 3-lane motorway seems to get very narrow once they reach the blockade7) Doesn't ANYBODY else see or hear the planes overhead?Yes, some of these flaws are because of the low budget, but perhaps then, Mr. Boyle shouldn't try to execute a big-budget project without the money.",28 Days Later...

Somewhere along the line he picks up a random (adult) female and later acquires a young girl. And off they go in search of other survivors. Of course, when they find them, all is not as they hoped. Never did trust military types.The enemy which needed to be fought off in this film was a bunch of 'rage' infected humans, rather than killer plants, but you get the general idea.And the moral?

546,devon_chris,"I'd rather think about it than watch it, for once...",6,4 November 2002,"Yeah, you read the summary right. I came out of this film almost laughing at how utterly bad it was. Only when I thought about it later did the odd subtlety of the piece occur to me - the fact that the virus in '28 days later' is called 'the rage', while 'le rage' is the French for 'rabies', which also saw Britain placed under 'quarantine'; the whole moral quandary of how we behave under duress, and indeed the question of man's place in the universe. These weren't bad ideas by any means, and some incredible films have been made on much much worse premises. So there you have it - '28 days later' has a fine director who knows how to capture true, gritty, desolation no less than he did years ago on Trainspotting; it has a decent enough idea of a plot; it has some whimsical black comedy, some poignant touches, and not a bad sense of drama; ultimately, it asks some cutting questions.So why did I come out of this film thinking it was so, so bad? Well, sad to say, it fails from the word go on some of the most basic counts. The acting is appalling, inexcusable, sub-soap-opera, diabolical, more zombified than the numerous extras, terrible, excruciating... a thesaurus would barely do justice to how absolutely dire the acting performances were. Usually in a dodgy piece of independent cinema, at least we come out thinking 'how's about so-and-so for a fine future talent' - well the same couldn't be said about '28 days'. The soldiers and both female leads are particularly poor. This is sad, since with some decent acting the film could have had some good things come out of it - it would certainly not have been removed to the level of farce it had been after the first twenty minutes by the panto-style fare it offered.Also alarming were Danny Boyle's shortcomings. Usually such a fine connoiseur of character-building, he happily resorts to feeble stereotypes - the boisterous, two-dimensional squaddies, the sinister tyrannical CO, the hardened feminist heroine. The only attempt at any sort of interesting characterisation lies in the hero's escapades towards the end, and in the tragic father-daughter relationship (though this becomes less impressive once you realise its complete dependence on 'Dusk Til Dawn'). All the characters suffer from severe lapses in rationality, not even explained by the exceptional circumstances they all find themselves in - in fact even less so: it simply doesn't make sense that in that sort of danger, 'Jim' would ever even consider going on his 'cheeseburger quest'.  Besides the poor characters, the dialogue is hardly glowing either - I always say that a reliable sign of a poor film is an excess use of the line 'let's get outta here'; in '28 days later', I counted dozens of utterances. What could have been some genuinely scary bits, too, were so long in coming that we yawned rather than jumped when 'frightened'. To be honest, I've woken up next to scarier things than this movie - despite being billed as a horror film, this doesn't even pretend to be; poor publicity there. Plus, check on the 'goofs' section of this webpage some time soon and doubtless someone who's thought about the film more than me will have given it the dressing-down it deserves in terms of plot holes. Also, the first half-hour left me stunned that we could still be subjected to such blatant product-placement in this enlightened day and age.Saddest of all, though, is that even the neat ideas the film does have are far from original. The concepts of growing brutality without law and order smack of 'Lord of the Flies'-cum-'Mad Max'; the messages that 1) animal testing labs are evil sadistic torture-pits, 2) man has come to the end of his time, and 3) man is such a horrible violent species by nature.... spare me, all of them, please. Thirty years ago this film would have been epoch-shattering, now it just smells dated, cliched, low-budget and half-hearted. Oh, and just in case you think I hadn't noticed, the whole first half of the film, with all its desolation, potential dread and tension, and all those deserted streets, isn't even original - just ask Charlton Heston.Basically, see this film if you're eager to see how your lottery money is being totally and utterly wasted, and don't mind a standard of acting performance which my little cousin's nativity play puts to shame. To be fair, I suppose you could see this film if long-exhausted ethical debates interest you, or if you never thought it was possible to stop all the traffic in a part of london for a few hours. DON'T watch it if you want your confidence in independent cinema given a boost - see Donnie Darko if that's what you're in to. Ultimately, though, if you really want to see something bleak, desolate, with a quirky post-apocalyptic edge after a deadly disease... watch Heston's 'Omega Man'. Give '28 days later' a miss - if it was a pet, it would have been put out of its misery a long time ago. Deader than the zombies. Five farts out of ten.",28 Days Later...

548,se7en45,A stunning achievement that bites both heart & mind...,10,5 July 2003,"28 DAYS LATER utilizes a brilliant story of apocalyptic proportions but reduces the premise down to a few incidents. By staging such a concept, Danny Boyle and his excellent crew, have created a superior thriller that juxtaposes genres as diverse as Science Fiction, Romance, Comedy, Tragedy, Horror, Action, etc. All these diverse ingredients are thrown into this melting pot and the end product will leave the connoisseur satisfied and sated on a visual feast for the eyes, an audio delight for the ears and a disturbing residue for the imagination.
The plot may have been seen in films such as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE OMEGA MAN, DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH etc, but Alex Garland, who I derided for his work on THE BEACH, has crafted a stark work which is blinding in it's clarity. Thankfully, after the Hollywood disaster that produced THE BEACH, this team of British artists have stayed true to their vision and integrity in bringing their daring project to the screen without the silly interference from executives.
Also, it's lovely to see great actors at work, these people carry no baggage from previous roles, their performances are filled with a raw intensity and leave a mark of indelible realism in each scene. All of the bad habits of typical Hollywood acting have been stripped away, there's no surplus fat on display here, no melodramatic outbursts, no cheesy one-liners (the bane of all the recent teenage slasher films), there's even a complete absence of an over-ripe budget to inflate egos and bring out the worst aspects of Stars becoming more important than the material.
This lovely little gem is an example of great film-making. All areas of production have been carefully analyzed and full justice has been done to the subject matter. From the opening, inside a dark laboratory, to the ending in an open field, everything comes together to create a picture with the perfect balance.
This film is extremely shocking and powerful, there's no glory in the violence, no release at all. Just sudden, and dirty, these brutal deaths appal and unnerve the viewer. Characters are lovingly, and realistically drawn and then suddenly dispatched in such sadistic pain that it will haunt the most hardened and jaded horror fan. The atmosphere reeks of unseen menace and danger, wide open spaces with sunlight suddenly become creepy and desolate. We see more horror in a silent, mysterious, eerie street than the whole of POLTERGEIST (filled with noise and special effects). I literally leapt out of my seat when the silent sound-stage explodes with the bleeping sound of a car alarm!
The choice of using Digital Video was inspired because it allowed the film-makers to shoot the film like a pseudo-documentary, fast moving and energetic. Just watch as Hollywood floods the market with cheap imitations in the near future. The fluid camera movements, rapid editing, parched colour scheme all heighten the levels of atmosphere. You just know a film has the hallmarks of a classic when you begin to sense fear in an open, and brightly lit, space. Danger clouds every scene. There's a hazy graininess which evaporates all warm colours, this leaves behind a sense of loneliness and alienation in the mind.
The film is packed to the hilt with visual metaphors which enrich our understanding of what is being revealed, step by step, layer by layer. The opening scene of a chimpanzee tied down and drugged is contrasted with the naked human, in the following scene, who's also laid out in a hospital bed and is slowly coming out of his zombified state. Like a newborn babe, fresh from the womb, he stumbles around in confusion until he finds his mother's milk, which in this case, has been ripped out of the stomach of a soft drinks machine. He guzzles down the fizzy, sugary drink with relish, his body arching backwards as his throat greedily slurps up the liquid. And, just like a child, he burps loudly and with pleasure. Now that he has tasted the forbidden fruit, Knowledge slowly starts to ignite his fuzzy memory. Outside, after he has absorbed the shock of a desolate wasteland devoid of any humans, he finds money on the pavement, he starts to grabs as much as he can until it dawns on him that there's more important things to do. Interestingly, it's at the house of God, a church, where like a resurrected Christ figure (just check out his visual appearance, beaming innocence like a child, the beard on his face, etc), his first experience with a zombie is a priest. Ironic and powerful. His rejection from the house of sanctuary is unsettling for the viewer, it seems to be saying that if there's no safety in the house of God, then where can one find peace?
We later discover that all established areas of life have been disrupted and left destroyed by the mechanisms that Humans have put in place. The Army, representing the State, is nothing more than another tribal group with their own hidden agendas. They are as much prisoners in their fortified mansions as are the raging zombies in the vast open places. No one is safe, not even the rats in the sewers, the cycle of life has been ruined and the spiral downwards into degeneracy has begun.
The film rips away conventions, thus, the zombies are not represented as slow and ponderous, instead, their rage and speed are very potent. They really do have bite! However, these creatures are not demonised, their actions and condition reveal that they could possibly deserve our pity. Compare their brutality with what the humans get up to. The assault on the two defenceless girls by the soldiers is horrific and very unsettling. It was great to see that the strongest character in the film was a woman and Black, what a break with convention that is! And our hero is an Irishman whilst the twisted Army commander is played by an Englishman. A punch in the face of stereotypes!
Some people have spoken about how they dislike the climax of this film. I just have to say that after the traumatic ordeal that the characters have waded through, and also the depths of darkness and evil that they had to overcome, I think it fitting that there was a glimmer of optimism and hope. And even with that final image, what concrete proof is there that all will be well? The message displayed on the green field reads ""HELLO"", yes Hell is Low, right beneath them, like a grave beneath the grass they're standing on. The jet flying overhead, once again represents the forces of the State. And what happened the last time our protagonists got tangled with the Army? They became guinea pigs to kick start the human race. So, even with that ending, I'm not too certain that everything's all hunky-dory for them. Just take note, there's no shot of the inside of the jet to reassure the audience that the pilot will radio in help for the survivors. There's no close-up of a human face in the plane's interior, just a nameless speck that booms across the valley like a spy. Very unsettling indeed.
The music was simply awesome in what it managed to do. Just listen to the soundtrack as the horses speed away across the fields, or the song that was played over the end credits. Haunting, emotive, sad, melancholic and perfect as the bookend.
This film is undauntedly a classic. A complete masterpiece in all departments. From the scorching acting, the harrowing script with realistically drawn characters, the disturbing atmosphere, the effective soundtrack, the hawk like direction, the brilliant production design, all these factors were beautifully merged in a symphony of psychological terror.
It's a pity that some misguided people are comparing this film to THE EXORCIST or other films in the ZOMBIE genre. That's sad because I personally feel that, despite the nods to other films, 28 DAYS LATER is a work of fresh originality that does not care for comparisons. It stands proud and high on its own merits.
A magnificent achievement, both for the heart and the mind, a tragic piece that will remain with you long after the film has finished. Quite simply, one of the best films that I've seen this year.",28 Days Later...

550,tiaanb-18673,It left me disappointed and bored by the end,3,25 October 2020,"I am writing this review three weeks after watching this movie, because after watching this I got burnt out from watching movies since I didn't find myself enjoying this film at all. I'll give credit where credit is due, the team behind this managed to make an original and somewhat refreshing take on the zombie apocalypse, where the main focus isn't really the zombies but the characters and how they change for the worse after the dead rises and starts eating people for sustenance. Certain elements of this film was great, but overall the movie didn't really evoke any felling out of me except boredom and I found myself checking the amount of time until the movie is over. The chemistry between the two main characters was basically nonexistent and felt extremely forced. Regarding the latter half of this film, I don't know how the army guys wouldn't be one of the first to be informed that the zombie virus is only contained within England and I find it hard to believe that they would reduce themselves to being rapists to fulfill their carnal desires merely a month after the outbreak happened, you're telling me they don't have any porno mags in any of those fully stocked convenience stores?

551,nealoade,The Second Best Zombie Movie Of All Time,9,31 January 2020,"Danny Boyle's flexibility as director is just so consistently surprising. You know what his next film after this was? After this, 'The Beach', 'Trainspotting' and 'Shallow Grave' before it? 'Millions', the Frank Cottrell Boyce penned kids book about a 7 year old finding a million pounds in a duffel bag. I don't always like his films, but I must hand it to the man, there aren't many spaces he can't fill.The direction here looks a little dated now, it feels very guerilla, very DIY from the offset (it wasn't, it had a healthy budget from Fox on their pseudo indie-label Fox Searchlight Pictures). The rawness works in the film's favour most of the time and is entirely appropriate given the genre.Perfectly contrasting this, there are moments in this movie that are so well timed and so well framed that they are nothing short of iconic. They gleam like diamonds in all of the gloom, and are so satisfyingly on the nose that they're almost Expressionist. They give the viewer more than a moment's pause and Boyle shows great instincts on when to let run what other people might dismiss as B-roll footage. A girl running down a dark hallway in a ballgown, a body falling down a tenement staircase, a sole plane flying over a forest after all civilization is supposedly dead, and let's not forget what we all came for in 2003, a man in hospital scrubs wandering an empty, abandoned London. The latter was nothing short of movie magic in those days, when fully rendered CGI environments were a thing reserved only for the absolute biggest of Hollywood blockbuster movies.Writer Alex Garland had at this point half proven himself to be a contender with 'The Beach' novel and screenplay, and he must have been hungry for another win. Where 'The Beach' was grounded in reality, specifically the experience of being young, dumb and full of cumbersome desire to travel and find oneself, descending then into flight of fancy, '28 Days Later...' takes people out of their world and into one Garland built himself, utterly horrific as it is. His dialogue takes a back-step in favour of a more tense and realistic silence (for practical reasons), which leaves him to play with and plot bigger scenarios and ultimately bigger themes. What he delivered was brutal, very concise and utterly convincing.Performances are just great really, across the board. Brendan Gleeson plays against type very nicely, Naomie Harris plays to type very well, a 26 year old Cillian Murphy acts his freaking socks off, and the film is gracefully cradled towards it's ending with the measured and self-assuredness of the always wonderful Christopher Eccleston, who stands guard like Nero, on the doorstop of his home town as it burns to crisp behind him.My goodness. It is a good film, and yes! You were right! The First Best Zombie Movie of all time IS George A. Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead'! Thank you and goodnight.

553,spambouk1000,"Bloody, Great Film",10,29 October 2006,"While the idea of zombies run amok in London seems like the premise of the film, there is a lot more here. I can't help but wonder if folks who didn't really like this film are actually reacting to their own mistaken expectations.Actually, the film invites us to think about the horror of violence in human nature: if the ""zombies"" are not terrifying enough simply as zombies (and they are pretty disturbing), the idea that we are already among the enraged zombies is perhaps more disturbing.The film follows Jim (Cillian Murphy) around London, as he awakes from a coma to find the city deserted. He encounters two other waifs, Selina and Mark, and from them learns that a virus has unleashed the normally suppressed hatred in humanity. The whole city has killed itself. In saving herself from the infected, Selina has become hardened and anti-social, but encountering a father and daughter makes her realize that surviving at all costs may not the best option.The high point of this film for me is Christopher Eccleston as Major West, who supposedly rescues Jim, Selina, and Hannah but has ulterior motives. His cool, calm exploitation of these people reminds us that while civilization may hide our basic aggression, civilized people may be just as cruel as the bestial infecteds.The film recalls scenes of horror in Sarajevo, in Poland, in Phenom Phen and in colonial America: a really moving (and terrifying) film that is hard to watch at times and very very hard to forget.",28 Days Later...

556,shargraves,Has it's moments,7,18 August 2003,"It's a film I've wanted to see for a long time - and last week I finally bought the DVD.The opening half hour really grabs you - petrol bombs in faces, bulging bloodshot eyes, staggering horrors and a desolate cityscape.From then on, they have a plot and a story and things, with plenty of dialogue, character development and eventually they explore good ideas based around the initial premise of this chilling end-of-the-world scenario.
But it doesn't have buckets of gore and tons of mindless violence - which is the reason I wanted to see it in the first place.Apart from being erroneously acclaimed as a Zombie film, it's more your kind of ""survival in the face of apocalyptic adversity"" type of affair - with the ""infected"" being humans imbued with terrible uncontrollable rage replacing yer actual ""walking dead.""There are a few moments of gore and violence - and by and large they are done with style. There are also a few moments of excellent suspense, delivering genuinely hair-raising thrills.Basically, I mean to say that it is a cut above the typical horror fare that is served to the brain dead masses, and it delivers a fairly satisfying couple of hours entertainment.It has emotional impact too - again something that your average horror movie lacks - and screen time is spent developing ideas  rather than wringing scene upon scene out of a single concept.28 Days later - with it's digital video look, is very reminiscent of British TV's scifi of the 70's and early 80's - THE SURVIVORS - QUATERMASS - DAY OFTHE TRIFFIDS (not the dire movie) - possessing a  sinister sense of low-budget menace, clipped diction and impending doom.But it strikes me that 28 days is a bit of a quick turnaround to lose the entire UK - and not have anyone with a radio to pick up foreign broadcasts or satellite TV.....Ah well - a thought provoking, genuinely horrible at times, movie,  but not in the same league as Romero's mighty Zombie trilogy.Initial thoughts 6/10ahhh what the hell, ambitious UK films deserve a lot more support than big budget Hollywood garbage that's floating around at the moment -

559,teddeman,28 Days Later you will still be trying to forget you wasted $7.50,1,1 July 2003,"What a let down.  I read the myriad of reviews already posted for this movie and was really looking forward to it.  Ugh!  I predict it will be gone from American theaters within 28 days of its release.  The concept is good but the forced themes and predictable plot structure hurt the film.As a movie patron one is expected to suspend disbelief and allow them to be drawn into the world of the movie.  Unfortunately film writers often push suspension of disbelief so far that even a 5 year old would question what they were seeing.  Welcome to `28 Days Left'; a story that spans 60 days in a world where the mass evacuation of London leaves no abandoned cars anywhere (except in the tunnels), zombies that hide off camera until the film needs some shock value (to wake-up the bored audience) and the `Rage' virus will turn you into a stark raving lunatic within 30 seconds of exposure.Where did everyone in London go?  Judging by the weekend grosses they were at the Cineplex watching `The Hulk'.  Why are there only dead people in church?  Why don't the zombies get food at all the abandoned grocery stores? Why was this movie ever made?Some questions are best left unanswered.  The movie did have some good scares but they were merely cheap gags.  There was no tension building, no sense of impending doom, and no sense of fear for the characters wellbeing. There was no gore.  That is right, the `scariest zombie film yet' had less gore and violence than Friday the 13th, on broadcast TV shown in place of Saturday morning cartoons.  By the end of the film I wanted the main characters to be infected with the 'Rage' virus and start killing each other.  Sorry that was spoiler.  The main characters don't kill each other in the final scene.Which brings me to the ending.  Not since the Keifer Sutherland version of `The Vanishing' has there been a more ridiculous example of a Hollywood happy ending.  The director would have better served the audience by leaving the last 3 minutes of the film on the cutting room floor.  He had an opportunity to give us a 'Jules et Jim' ending and salvage a shred of his integrity.  Instead the audience is force-fed a `Scorpion King' happy ending.If this review is more incoherent and disjointed than my usual ones, consider it my homage to the film.  Consider it an echo of the plot.  My advice is rent `Night of the Living Dead' (either version) instead.",28 Days Later...
560,mwhiteho,Best horror movie in 30 years....NOT!,6,3 November 2002,"This movie is a brutally realistic movie about the days following a virus that wipes out the entire United Kingdom.  It has some fantastic shots of London absolutely deserted, which make it amazing to imagine, but none the less this film has one major downfall..... it's got far too much talking and not enough action.It is rated as an 18 and yet it has almost 20 minute intervals(or so it seems) between disgusting, gorey murders and attacking scenes. Not to say I'm only there for the blood and guts, but it is portrayed as a zombie film so i didn't expect a deep and meaningful discussion every time they changed location.The only thing that made this film more bearable was the black comedy one liners, which made it so much easier to watch.  In fact I would go as far as to say, that if this had been a video I would have quite easily fast forwarded it at least 2 or 3 times as the story line was going nowhere.I'm not saying don't go to see this because if you like ""zombie"" films, that's what it is but please don't expect wall to wall action because you will sorely disappointed.Marks out of 10  -  6.5 ( and that's higher because of the humour)",28 Days Later...
561,nzbungy,Enjoyable,8,2 July 2003,"""Possible Mild Spoilers Ahead: Proceed with caution.""
I just saw this film.  After greatly liking Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I was expecting a slight twist on zombies, from what I had read in reviews and so forth.  And that's what I got. Quite scary, rather tense, and greatly atmospheric, the movie, filmed on digital video, succeeds in packing a punch.  However, it was this same filming that irritated me.  Unlike the calm, almost peaceful directing of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""28 Days Later..."" insists on constantly flashing images at us.  So quick and fast, it plays almost like an MTV music video.  It greatly bothered me, unlike ""Lola Rennt,"" which used the same technique masterfully. Nevertheless, I still greatly enjoyed it.  Being a fan of horror films, I wasn't disappointed.  The girl with whom I saw it didn't particularly care for the ending.  But, I ask, how else can a zombie horror film end?  The other endings they filmed are also possible, with Jim dying and so forth, but the best way, in my opinion, is to leave it to the audience to imagine them being rescued.  In conclusion, it's not the best horror or zombie flick, but does add a new dimension to zombies.  However, this was slightly offset by the directing, which irritated me constantly.  In purely technical terms, I would give this a 7 out of 10, but with my bias toward this genre, my final score is 8 out of 10.P.S. Why the male nudity?  And so much of it.  Is that something British?Oh, well.",28 Days Later...
562,deathtostefan,28 days later...and still thinking about it,10,27 June 2003,"Well, it may not be exactly 28 days since I've seen this movie, but you might get the idea. Every once in a while the memory of this movie pops back into my mind, and I'm remembered to make sure to see this film again. I rank it amongst the best zombie movies I have seen. People who are into those old italian splatter zombie movies might not agree, but I often feel that those are a completely different genre. This work compares to the George A. Romero trilogy night/dawn/day of the dead, where tension is partly build with the threat of the undead, but mostly with the psychological effects on the survivors and the strain, carelessness and inhumanity that comes with that. I have always found it an interesting idea what would happen if suddenly for some reason only a small group of people would survive, there would be a 'natural' enemy again, and all boundaries of human civilization and conduct were to fall away. It is a theme that also can be found in John Wyndham's book Day of the Triffids (don't bother with the film, it stinks), that gives cause for reflection on our society and its rules of behaviour, which are more elusive than we generally stop to think about. (for instance: what if there are only a few people left and you have to build a new society, is monogamy in that case a smart idea or should a man have as many wives as possible just in order to sustain our race?(interesting question, isn't it?)). 28 days later... doesn't go as far as to consider the rebuilding of a civilization, but it touches on quite a few points that are amiss with ours, and makes an interesting search through the different kind of views and behaviour that people will expose in this kind of situation. This gives a depth to the movie that makes it very interesting. The effect of all this on the movie is that there a quite a few long sequences where you won't see a zombie whatsoever, but where there's still an enormous tension, or sometimes even complete relaxation as the main characters almost seem to forget the situation and indulge in old habits. a fairly human trait I think, just remember people going to the theatres a few days after WTC-incident to forget it all for a moment. But when the undead show up they are really scary. The filmmakers really managed to create monsters that are more effective than any old zombie could have been in a modern movie. The fairly low budget with which this film was made is also a blessing for the movie I think. It demands from a director to be more creative with his possibilities and the camerawork, which results in very atmospheric scenery and beautiful shots. (keep for instance an eye out for scenes with rain in it, and you'll know what I mean). This all is combined with strong acting and a hell of a soundtrack ( to hear God Speed You Black Emperor underneath images of deserted London sends shivers down my spine).In short: this film kept me spellbound for its full length and I can recommend it to anyone who wants to see a horror film with depth instead of cheap thrills. And if you like it then you should also check out Romero's Trilogy of the Dead and Wyndham's novel Day of the Triffids.",28 Days Later...
563,jack_horner01,It's not a damn Zombie film!!!!,10,30 June 2003,"I need to get this off my chest. All you morons who think this is a Zombie film, please hush your mouth. This is an horror/thriller movie about a post apocalyptic world, where most of the population is infected with a virus. The virus deteriorates the mind of the contractee and leaves them with nothing but rage. These vicious half humans scower the earth destroying anything that moves. In other words, it is a socialistic statement about rage in modern society, and how we see it in every day situations; road rage, trolley rage, domestic disputes etc. So there you go. Solved. It is not a poxy zombie film, so all you silly people can go away and watch the very haunting and original Jeppers Creepers or something childish.Now thats out of the way. I will begin my review.Danny Boyle. Trainspotting, Shallow Grave, (Cough) The Beach (cough). This guy is a great export for Britain, he is one of very few british directors who still exist today, that refuse to make gangster films or period dramas. He has, in my eyes, redeemed himself from The Beach by making this movie.It is fast, furious, and work to be proud of. From the word go, the film shows a definate spark of an inventive mind. The dialogue, the framing, the choice of mise-en-scene. Everything seems natural, yet serves a purpose.Although the film may not be scary, i feel it works the same as Blair Witch. There is no way i would go camping now, and after seeing 28 days later i always think about what effect my anger could have on people. If i am shopping, i begin to notice people arguing more. I wonder what it would be like if human traffic was no-existant.This is deffinately a movie that will stay with you. You will remember entire sequences shot for shot, as it is very gripping stuff.

564,SuperDaveMader,A intriguing and brilliant film,8,2 August 2003,"This turned out to be the best film about zombies taking over since Dawn of the Dead. Though I expected it to be a cheesy flick filled with cheap pops and marginally scary events iced with an obvious romance, however it spoke a much deeper meaning to myself, filled with lessons about humanity and the basic instinct. The film's directing was simply brilliantly done, with a soundtrack complimenting the films mood perfectly. I found the characters to be compelling in their own desperate motif. The virus infecting everyone said a lot about the mob mentality and the clearly spoken arguments of how man has always killed man and that the events in the movie have nothing different then was already present in the world. I felt that if the film had continued without them reaching the source of radio broadcast, the film could have gone in a much better direction. A story of them trying to reach the broadcast like some kind of road to salvation could have been a slightly more suspenseful story. The alternate ending was actually disapointing and I was glad that they used the other ending with a more 'happier' ending. I felt that this was not one of those films where the protagonist should die. I'm not sure if birds have a symbolism, but I must have counted like 100 of them in various shots.I thought that this was going to be Britain's answer to Resident Evil, but this was actually much better. 8/10.p.s.

566,hjpog,One of the best of infected movies..,10,17 June 2017,"Firstly when you try to watch with a constantly controversial community with the film, if you evaluate this 28-day adventure with blank glances like the British excavation that has eaten the virus since the minute of the end, you will see that the movie is directly virus-infected. In other words, the movie is infected, it's processed from beginning to end. It is a film that can be described as a classic among the infected movies. The fact that it is not possible to leave the island in the film, what is attributed to the fictional, may be considered a reference to both empty London streets and perhaps Hollywood cinema, the UK is the center of the world. It is possible to search for mistakes in the film, to sort out the parties who are not suitable for the real life. However, in my opinion, a film that features more fictional items alongside these real icons, should not be considered too much. All kinds of material used as classical zombie movie stereotypes virus, red eyes, rapid change, aggression and protection, this is a metaphor. If Boyle is trying to get the viewer into the film, he has done it a lot, I do not think that Boyle try to overlap and confront the reality in a movie with such fantastic content. The film begins with a classical zombie movie and then shows the war that people turn into psychological tension and what they can do to survive and what they can do. The soundtracks in the movie are tremendous. Nowadays these soundtracks are still available in many places. The film has great views because it is captured with a digital camera. This visuality is even better, especially since the shoots are usually in the morning. Through Danny Boyle, this film has been interpreted differently by many people. Because you can get many questions in the movie. These questions are almost always an answer, but audience comments can be joined very clearly. Because there is not always a definite answer in the film. So it makes a good movie to think about the events to the audience. In the film you feel the difference of using a basic camera very clearly. Even though it is fantastic in terms of content, this basic camera makes the film very realistic. In summary, despite the fact that the film is fantasy-based, the basic camera shots can give you a fear. Only in the last scene was a movie camera. It allows you to feel as though you were in that adventure, as if you had taken an event that you experienced.",28 Days Later...
567,synicalsaint,"Could have been great, it's a pity",6,21 July 2004,"************************SPOILERS************************In my opinion Boyle tried to make one single movie out of Romero's Living Dead Trilogy, you have most of the themes and ideas explored in these cult classics such as a society destroying its predecessor, the military base, the characters helping themselves in shops...etc. The problem is that Boyle never really develops any of these ideas as Romero did. He talks of the uselessness of money and criticizes mass consumerism but seems to completely forget about this idea when the second part of the movie starts. As soon as the characters are taken into custody by the army he completely forgets his first message and criticizes martial law and other things. Although there are many good ideas in the movie I just get the feeling that Boyle got most of the ideas while watching the Living Dead movies.An other major problem with this flick is that it really lacks character development. Firstly there aren't many characters who survive throughout the story and you don't really identify to them. Secondly the back up characters such as Hanna really lack presence, you don't have a clue who she is and what she's like. The army men are empty shells and Franck who is the best secondary character dies in the middle of the movie.I give it a 6/10 because the directing and visuals are good and because there was quite a lot of potential to the film.",28 Days Later...

Why such a high rating? There are many reasons why I rated this film as having ten star quality. Here's a few:1) Never, at any moment during this film, did it become predictable.... I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety of it's duration. Being a fan of horror movies, this is a big deal for me.2) It's realistic: Diseases on our planet mutate. This is factual. There are some that mutate from being spread by physical contact, to being spread through the air. In other cases, diseases that once could only infect one species, mutate in order to be able to infect other species'. This happens on our planet. The writers of this movie dare to ask the question, ""what happens if a truly terrible disease, like mad cow disease for example, jumps to the human species?"" Don't worry, this is not a spoiler. 3) This movie will make you feel every type of emotion possible. You'll laugh during this film, cheer during this film, and cry during this film. It's not just a horror movie, it's a romantic comedy at times, an action flick at times, and even an adventure / road trip feel at times. I'm not familiar with many movies like this one. Which leads to my final point.... 4) It's a unique film. Is it scary? Yes, uniquely though. Would you compare this film to many others? No, I definitely would not. It's in a league of it's own, and I CAN'T STAND when people call this a zombie film. If you're not a fan of horror, I'd still give this one a shot. It's fantastic.

As Chance has it, a man survives and stands witness to the end of society.But to my surprise and distress, this man just happens to be one of the most stupid persons who walk the earth (and ""happens to be"" is a poor excuse to base an entire film on). He wakes up in an obviously devastated hospital, and doesn't get it. Walks around for hours in an obviously devastated town, and still doesn't get it. Picks up a news-paper, takes a brief look, and throws it away (shouldn't he like to learn what had happened?!). Then, he goes to a church where he meets a monster-like priest, eyes popped out, blood all over his face, sounding like a enraged wild beast and he asks, gently ""father, are you alright?"".And no-where do we learn that he'd sustained some brain damage and that's why he's acting so bizarre, to say the least. Did I mention that he was screaming all over the obviously deserted, empty town-square 'hello, anybody'? That must be learned helplessness from some other stupid film, cos any real person would've looked for other people in a more practical, reasonable way.So, the poor man who spent hours walking around the town finally meets some other healthy people and suddenly he remembers he has a family! And suddenly becomes very, very emotional and concerned for them, throwing a temper-tantrum at the mere thought of not being aloud to go home.The rage metaphor is great, and the real-life footage in the beginning is very moving - but this is a badly written story, and poor characters.I won't even mention the fact that they blame the demise of the human race on the save-the-poor-animals activists (way-to-go, guys! they're not that smart, either, are they?!?).If you have a brain and can't give it a brake for 110 minutes, don't.

571,michelleeb,So very very dull.,1,13 April 2008,"Now, I love Zombie movies - Romero, Raimi, even Shaun of the Dead are classics. But this ... this is just boring. (And in response to a previous reviewer who implied that those who didn't like this are too thick for 2001 and Memento - I both loved and understood those movies). There is no sense of impending terror, apart from one all-too-brief sequence in a tunnel (although you have to wonder why they were stupid enough to go in there). The characters are very one-dimensional, and the female lead goes from being a machete-wielding tough girl to a screaming, cringing little girl waiting for the big brave man to rescue her (Apparently falling in love makes men murderous and women weak). The much vaunted opening sequence of an empty London has been done before, and better, in Day of the Triffids. There were a couple of 'make-you-jump' moments - but not many. The final battle sequence is so disjointed and awkward it's difficult to know what's going on.I understand this meant to be a zombie movie for the intelligentsia, as Cloverfield is a monster movie for the intelligentsia, but it lacks the latter's sense of danger, sense of devastation, and real, in depth characters. In fact, I hated these characters so much, that by the end, I was hoping the zombies would get them.Shaun of the Dead has horror, death, gore and is actually scary enough to keep me glued to the screen - and that's a parody.

Not as much substance, not so much happening as there should have been, could have been slicker, more style. The acting by main characters was OK, the plot from around halfway through was not, afraid to say. Better the setting should have been kept in London for most of the film, more scope for greater scenes of suspense. Instead we saw the motley bunch of survivors legging it out of the capital ASAP.

Imagine how much more powerful those scenes would have been if he'd brought along a 35mm camera as well as a cheapo DV one.Speaking of which, the general decision to go with DV was - I think - a mistake. You're never really that frightened (in the conventional sense) of anything since you can barely make anything out!

The ""rage virus"" goes to the theory about how formal communication separates us from the animals, and when certain characters are contaminated, they no longer have that and basically go by primal needs and emotions destroying everything and everyone, pulling the human race back down all the way below animal races. This is expressed best not through a sequence with the ""infected"", but ironically enough by a group of horses which now run free after the incidents, with an entire family of horses running alongside others across a grassy field. It is also shown just how easy it is for a loved one to be taken away from us by such a virus causes some emotional disturbances and a lot of ""what if?"" questions. It also shows how when we're put in a crisis of such high magnitude how even non-""infected"" can revert to primal instincts and once again, we destroy ourselves. This is one of the few horror flicks since those of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""The Omega Man"" to have these social commentaries, and in the world we live in now with terrorist attacks, newer viruses, foreign wars, it makes you start to wonder... how much longer will something like this only be a movie?

I suppose that it could be used as an exercise for budding screenwriters to be shown how to avoid illogical plot lines and characterisations, but this really is a turkey of a movie.

IMDb tells us that:""Christopher Ecclestone and the other soldiers in the film had a three-day training programme with real soldiers to help them learn how to carry themselves believably."" Believably?! Really? Or did they (Boyle, whoever etc) instead just have Ecclestone play the part of a crazed fascist and the squaddies act like a rabble of football hooligans in uniform.

The film, which follows a band of people who have survived an outbreak which renders its victims into deranged killers, starts off superbly.  It also helps that the film was filmed with homemade cameras on a low budget.  That helped make the film much rawer and intense than if it used a more polished film.  The sense of isolation is also portrayed well, such as when the survivors are driving around through the empty streets of London, which is covered in trash and ruin.  Unfortunately, during the film's final act, the story falls apart and becomes excessively confusing and leaves us with no one to root for.  The twist towards the end also doesn't seem to have the reaction the filmmakers were expecting from us.  A shame that a bad ending happened to an otherwise good movie.",28 Days Later...

After a pulsating prologue of a break in at an animal test laboratory, all goes quiet after the deafening crashing against metallic cages by chimps-this sound is relentless and cuts to the quick. After the simplistic title fades into view (and fades out...) we meet the protagonist, Jim (played with shocked bemusement by Cillian Murphy) who wakes up in a deserted hospital bed in London (28 Days Later). This is where we witness film making at it's best as Jim walks around a completely 'empty' London and sees various clues as to what's happened over the last month. As a member of the audience, one begins to imagine the calamity and horror that mainland Britain was subjected to. Jim sees clues on notable landmarks(Picadilly Circus)of letters of bereavement which were very similar to those in New York back in Sept'2001.Jim meets with fellow survivors and gets to grips with what's happened and what to do. The second act is just as powerful as the survivors head North to meet a deranged army unit. Is this their salvation? Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland cook up a film treat that is so much more than a shock horror film-it's deeper, witty, horrific and strangely realistic. Released a year after the very real horror that was the attack on America on 9/11 and faced with political paranoia of the end is nigh, if watched in a surround sound situation in a multiplex, this must have seemed downright unforgettable.

582,rc_whittle,Suspend your disbelief for a moment and enjoy.,8,28 June 2003,"Certainly there are many who would say that ""28 days later"" is based on an unrealistic premise, and has several chronological impossibilities, and conceptual absurdities, however this is very enjoyable Sci-fi movie, and enjoyable sci-fi horror movies are very few and far between, so realise the good in this one and it might just make your day.Suspend your disbelief for one moment and enjoy the mood of this film.I'm a Brit too and seeing my beloved London does admittedly bring a tear having lived in the states for over a year now, but with my own personal motivations aside this movie is striking and captivating throughout.Consider this: Everyone is dead but you and a few others.What would you do? drug yourself into a coma? break into shops and steal whatever you can lay your hands on, perhaps spend your last days feasting on the finest foods and drinks you can find? Would you look for a way to renew civilization? would you fight against adversity? Would you kill to stay alive? Would you kill a friend to stay alive?These thoughts were all on my mind in the first ten minutes of this movie.It is no spoiler to say that H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds is very much brought to mind when watching this film, but the alien killing machines are replaced with former humans - now killer zombies so-to-speak.The Aliens saga also comes to mind, it's kind of like the story was written by the illigitimate and miraculous lovechild of Steven King and Michael Crichton.The horror, gore and violence level is high, and in the theatre I was in I saw some dumb woman had brought a young son to the movie, who I felt very sorry for, he's likely going to be in therapy for a long time.Don't bring kids to this one guys, I know it says R, but you should be warned, this will given the timid and the little ones nightmares on epic scale.The cinematography seems very fresh, fluid and yet juggled with complex camera angles and tracking shots. The mood is dark, and filled with suspense and a tension between the characters which constantly nears breaking point, but somehow there is humor too.Yes, this movie isnt exactly realistic, you'll have to forgive the writers that, but if you give the director a chance he'll keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours.Almost Magnificent 8/10",28 Days Later...

The characterization and character development is very strong and this is one of the few horror film that made fell sad and emotional for one of the character's death. Danny Boyle's is excellent - The chase sequences and action sequences are brilliantly done and this one of the few films where I didn't find the use of shaky cameras irritating or distracting! and the acting is excellent as well.

It looks more expensive than it is with a budget of around 5 million (almost equivalent to the budget given to Shaun of the dead) Boyle makes the most of it with ingenious methods for getting the shots that he wants giving the film a scope beyond its limitations.In all but detail it is a zombie film. They maybe quicker and technically not dead but it is a technicality that the viewer will soon forget.Credit to writer Alex Garland who takes time to explain the cause of the infection without bogging down the story in needless exposition. Also credit too that he creates realistic characters, survivors who we can relate with.Yes the film falls away into convention later on with the meeting between survivors and British military (Why do British soldiers seem more unnerving?) and has a few questionable moments which could make you go ""what?!"" but you have to forgive it for these conventions.",28 Days Later...

There is an awful virus spreading fast throughout the world.As soon as you get in touch with this virus, you transform irreversible into an unscrupulous killing machine... You can't quite call the victims of the virus zombies because they were never buried under the ground,but to make it easier for myself, i'll stick to zombies.The weird thing about ""28 Days Later"" is that the zombies don't move like they just drank 3 bottles of gin like in traditional zombie movies.No, these zombies are fast and very mobile too.And that is something that makes them, in a strange way, less threatening than for example the zombies in ""Night of the Living Dead"". Especially in the first half of the movie, director Danny Boyle is still very good at what he does: the beginning feels like an uppercut and the streets of London are very scary, if it wasn't for the unfitting guitar sounds. But as soon as the main characters leave the big city and arrive at a castle full of horny soldiers, the movie bleeds to death.No more scary images,the actors start acting very poor and this second half of the movie ends in an old fashion and routinely slasher party...

All together this is a pretty different movie; Generally for Romero fans this will seem a little boring, which is what I thought. Its not that especially violent, and has a different view of zombies than what is usually shown. I was a little disappointed with this movie, after all the hype I saw about it I thought this was going to be an absolute excellent movie.

589,The_Master_Critic,completely worthwhile entertainment,8,6 November 2004,"28 Days Later is about a virus (RAGE) that spreads throughout Great Britain and affects people by turning them into desperate, ravenous, zombie-like monsters. Their eyes turn red, and they scream and growl as they try to rip apart any non-infected humans they can find. The main character of the film, Jim (played by Cillian Murphy), awakens in a quiet hospital 28 days after the virus is accidentally released by animal rights activists who were trying to free chimpanzee test subjects infected with the RAGE virus. The hospital, along with the rest of London, is seemingly deserted as Jim wanders aimlessly through the empty streets. Extremely similar to the opening of Vanilla Sky, this scene is perfect in creating the empty lonesome tone of the first act. The movie follows Jim as he journeys to not only find safety, but to understand what has happened to everyone he once knew and loved. I was left with one big question. If everyone infected turns into one of the 'zombies,' where was everyone??Right away, I realized that no one was safe in this story. You can't assume that the characters you love will live and the ones you hate will die. One thing I really liked was that once infected, the virus would take hold of a person within seconds. This took out the traditional moments of 'Oh no, so and so is infected and no one knows  I guess we'll watch the virus slowly develop over the length of the film while building a very cheap, overused, yet somewhat effective bit of suspense.' I liked the fact that if someone was infected, you had better kill them sooner than later  or risk them turning on you. Another thing I really liked about the 'zombies' is that they do not stalk their victims by sluggishly pursuing them with a long drawn out groan. These guys are fast! They dash towards their prey while screaming and vomiting blood. It really is gruesome.Speaking of gruesome, this film very much feels at times like the 'B Movies' it has borrowed from. The gore is over the top and the picture quality of the movie is really poor since it was filmed on digital video. I don't know if it was done solely for purposes of budget, or just to create a low budget gritty feel, but I can't help but wonder if it would have come across more clearly had they shot on traditional film and spared us the halo ridden blur of pixels void of any sort of detail. Then again, the movie may not have worked at all had it been shot differently. It is interesting to note that the final shots of the movie were shot on film. This is clearly significant, but to keep the review clean of spoilers I will say no more.The all British cast did a fine job. The only actor I was familiar with was Brendan Gleeson who was very good as expected. The other actors may be well known in the UK, but they are all unknown in my mind, and they all did very nice work.I have a new respect for director Danny Boyle. Some of the shots in this movie are downright terrifying, while others are absolutely breathtaking. The entire post-virus Britain is brilliantly realized, and some of the images will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. I don't think the filmmakers were trying to make any statements about SARS, nor were they trying to draw any other real world parallels, but it is hard not to become just a little more paranoid after having seen the film. Sure it's preposterous that a virus would turn a normal human being into some terribly violent and hopeless monster full of despair and a lust for human blood, but it does make for a suspenseful and at times shocking movie that horror fans deserve after putting up with the dreck that they usually have to settle with. (Now that was a long sentence.) It isn't the scariest movie ever, but it was a Kevin Costner cameo away from being close.",28 Days Later...

Sure, its hard to get used to trying to hear the language clearly (I have a hard time making clear words from British accents!) but once you get into the movie, its awesome! Starts off a bit slow, little bit of Cillian Murphy penis which kinda makes me think, ""hmm.. where is this movie going?"" but once he reaches the church, its a non-stop thrill ride! Just constant thrills! its not like Resident Evil although lots of people say it is. The ""infected"" are just out of control. They are fast and they attack with extreme efficiency. I really wish there would be a sequel to this movie. It would be interesting to see. Or maybe even a prequel. In the movie, it discusses what happens while Jim (Cillian) was unconscious for 28 days. They should make a part 2 about what happened in those days. Or even the days after all the infected start to slowly die off. Would be interesting to see another outbreak somewhere. It can't just end there!! It had better not be like the Terminator series where it takes 10 years to make another part! Who agrees with me!?",28 Days Later...
591,moskwiz,An alternate view on zombie-movies,9,15 July 2006,"28 Days Later is not your typical zombie-movie. This is so, because of 3 main reasons: It's not pointless - it actually has a good plot and a fabulous twist in the end; it's not built upon gore - it's very humanitarian; and, it's not a horror-movie - it's a movie with zombies in it.Besides good acting and a well-written script, 28 Days Later has an ability not many recent movies (at least not many recent zombie-movies) have - it really gets you involved. As crazy as it sounds, people can relate to this one! All this adds up to a well earned 8/10. It is one of the best Horror movies I've seen and to be frank, one of my favorites in general. Recommend to catch this one even if you're not into the genre.",28 Days Later...
592,AT-AT,Effective and creepy flick,7,11 October 2006,"Shooting this on digital video was the best move Danny Boyle made with this violent and quite creepy movie. It gives the movie a look as bleak and oppressive as the story it tells. Its vicious looking, cold and picks up on every detail. It puts the action, and every drop of blood, right in your face, and that sets it apart from (and lifts it above) the standard set by most Hollywood movies in its genre (Dawn of the Dead remake, Land of the Dead). The hand-held 'shaky-cam' makes for an extremely hyper-kinetic cinematography, and that conveys to the attacks by the 'infected' in their unstoppable rage. And to the desperation so well portrayed by the actors both during safety, but also during fights. Selena hacking away at an infected with a machete is particularly nasty.Personally I have always preferred slow zombies over fast moving like the ones from Nightmare City or the new Dawn remake, as the slow make for more hopeless situation and desperation. (you can run, but you cannot hide) The ability to outrun zombies makes for a perfect sense of safety even though there is none.Although the 'infected' are not zombies, they are in the same ballpark. In this case their ability to move fast and make chase only help empathize the force that drives them. Pure rage. Any other emotion and self perseverance is completely gone, and that makes for some truly psychotic and terrifying antagonists. Times have changed (unfortunately) and extras aren't a buck a dozen anymore, and due to the films small budget, we never get a massive amount of 'infected' on screen at any one time and that takes away at the apocalyptic feel of the film unfortunately. But the ones that get on screen lifts the action and tension up to whole new highs.The acting are all you could wish for from Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson and Naomie Harris. Their behavior and choices are well founded, and when in panic, you totally forget to 'know better'. Never did I think ""why didn't they do that or this"" or ""how come..."" because the desperation is transferred so well. And heres the exception. The kid actor! How come 9 out of 10 kid actors suck? And how come directors never see it, or do something about it if they do? Megan Burns fortunately has few important scenes, but the ones she has, she sinks with bravura. Everything she says is in a monotone voice and her body language is about as lively as a corpse's. The soldiers roles calls for some depth also. They are stereotyped, somewhat due to their simple dialogue, but also in the role they play in this story. But they do it convincingly enough, and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat.Overall an effective and creepy flick but remember; movies should be seen on the big screen in the darkness. Especially this one benefits from that.",28 Days Later...
593,moviebuff201,"A great movie with an awesome, humane story!",10,8 March 2006,"IT's rare that a movie about brutal killings and zombie-like people can show that horror movies can be true works of art. 28 Days Later meets that exception and rises above it. Fun and imaginative, it gives people a chance to see the rare humanity that comes from death and disaster. This movie is a great movie to show you that! Cillian Murphy does a spectacular job as Jim, a regular joey who wakes up in a hospital. He leaves and soon realizes that London is totally deserted. When he tries to find some signs of life in a church, he realizes that the people in it are nuts! When they chase him, he gets help from Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) who tell him that the entire place is filled with the ""RAGE"", a virus that gives the infectees a bad case of angry and a thrill to kill people. When Mark dies, Jim and Selena join forces with Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns) to try and get out of the country alive. When Frank dies, the three go to a safe house guarded by soldiers. When the soldiers decide to keep the girls alive for their own amusement. Now it's up to Jim to save the girls from an enemy worse than the virus-infectees. A fantastic movie with an awesome plot and a lot of heart, this movie should be on anyone's watch list! No one should miss this movie and it's story that capture's the emotions of human feelings and human people. The characters are well written and superbly played and the soldiers, who play the more dangerous foes, are some of the best villains. Watch this movie, by all means watch it!!",28 Days Later...
594,imnotinsane1,Not really as terrifying as I thought but a very unique movie nonetheless...,7,2 July 2007,"There is something odd about the way movie promotion teams make their movies look like what they actually aren't, weather it's with terms of genre or quality. Please don't laugh but back in 2002, when the movie came out in the UK (which is of course the country where this movie originates from and takes place at), I was terrified of seeing this movie purely because the poster scared me enough! I saw it because it was playing on Channel 4 not too long ago, playing in the same room where I was busy on the computer I use and I slowly found myself watching it out of blind curiosity so then after getting into it, I logged off and started watching it properly and I was very delightfully surprised by it.I do not consider ""28 Days Later"" as a horror of any real kind but I more consider it as a very tense sci-fi thriller. This is great for people like me who really are not fans of the horror genre but that said, the movie still has some haunting elements and quite a bit of bloody violence so people who love horror wouldn't feel too disappointed neither. There are a lot of other reasons why this movie is so unique, it's use of digital video to shoot the more intense scenes is an ingenious idea and makes the whole experience even more adrenaline-filled, exciting and in the right moments, a bit scary too.Other things to mention is that the story is very clever and the screenplay by Alex Garland delivers it incredibly well without lacking in any place throughout the movie, the direction by Danny Boyle is very professionally done, the score by John Murphy is very original and atmospheric and the acting is superb, especially for a movie like this.So to round things up, if you don't like horror, ""28 Days Later"" is the best alternative to the genre around. To those who do like horror, ""28 Days Later"" won't disappoint you there neither. Definitely worth checking out!

598,I Am The Cheese,"Two reels good, one reel bad...",7,1 November 2002,"Once again the policy of Sneak Previewing anything remotely horror on Halloween gives you the power to ruin the film for everyone else.  I say this, as there may be some Spoilers ahead.The premise is all well and good, with the populace infected with a viral form of Road Rage (to quote Danny Boyle), decimating it within a month to a few survivors.  The intro gets to the heart of the matter, as Animal Rights activists unintentionally unleash the virus in a stylish, and well edited, sequence.However, the film really kicks in as Jim wakes up in a hospital, with the key slid under the locked door.  As he wanders the halls, the place is dead - no people, no sound, even the phones are dead.  Soon he is on the streets of London, desolate with no signs of life - a sequence worth the entrance fee alone, as Westminster Bridge is covered in discarded trinkets, piles of money lie around The Bank of England, with overturned buses lining the roads, and the centre of Piccadilly Circus awash with missing posters. Soon, Jim seeks sanctuary in a church, and the action begins in a typical way - an ""Infected"" Priest approaches him, much in the same way as every single zombie film has an encounter with a lone zombie, and the protagonist has no idea of what is happening, even apologising for striking it down.Skipping a few plot details, eventually Jim and Selina meet with father and daughter Frank and Hannah, and find out there may well be safety in Manchester with a group of soldiers, and decide to get out of London - in Frank's black cab, including another great sequence occurs in the Dartford Tunnel, but I won't spoil it - even if it is in the trailer.However, once they reach Manchester (a burnt out ruin), the film starts to unravel, skipping the interesting premise of the first hour and turning into Day of the Dead pretty damn quick - the characters of the soldiers is very similar (if a tad more Cockney), and they have a pet ""Infected"" (like Bub the zombie), among many others, at which point you start to question if the first half was just liberally borrowing from Omega Man/Quiet Earth/Rabid/The Stand.Also, in the second half, the characterisation goes to Hell.  Many of the soldiers are cut & paste, with the exception of Sgt Farris and Christopher Eccleston's Major West.As a recommendation, the first hour stands up well, but the last third suffers from a feeling of being tacked on and ripped off.  Personally, I blame writer Alex Garland, who can't write without a gory meltdown to finish, such as the book version of The Beach.All in all, the film works up to a point (ie, when in London), but as soon as the soldiers are introduced, everything falls away - even the DV camerawork starts to look just ugly, when a few minutes before, in the sequence in the field, it looked beautiful.Seven out of Ten, with an asterix marked ""Could Do Better.""",28 Days Later...

603,bodhisattva13,Lord of the Flies meets Outbreak,8,30 June 2003,"Danny Boyle is an exceptionally gifted filmmaker and I've been enamored with his work since the brilliant ""Shallow Grave."" ""Trainspotting"" only gets better every time you see it and ""A Life Less Ordinary"" has some bright moments. (The singing and dancing number is parfait.) Mr. Boyle hit a bump in the road when it came to ""The Beach,"" but then he forsake us all by casting DiCaprio. He's back to redeem himself, as is Alex Garland, with ""28 Days Later,"" a marvelous twist on the apocalyptic film.IMDB's summary isn't completely accurate in that ""nearly the entire planet has been wiped out."" But that's a plot twist you'll have to uncover for yourself. What occurs - a la ""12 Monkeys"" - is while trying to expose the work taking place at a primate research center, a group of activists unwittingly release a virus called rage. The way it works is if a person is bitten by an infected person, he or she develops a murderous rage and desire to kill within 10 to 12 seconds. (Infection can also occur if the afflicted person's blood enters another person's body, through the nose, eye, mouth or open wound.)Twenty-eight days after being hit by a car, Jim, a bike courier and our film's hero, wakes up to find London deserted. He eventually meets two other survivors and then encounters another two. After picking up a radio broadcast that calls all uninfected people to Manchester, the survivors fight off the infected and make their way to what seems like the promised land. Complications follow is all I'll say.Some have compared this film to George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead,"" giving some people the wrong impression that this is the British take on the zombie flick. Wrong. The infected aren't zombies but they are terrifying. They can be killed and the director doesn't gross us out by showing the infected feasting on human flesh. (All in all, ""28 Days"" isn't visually disgusting. It's the thought of what's going on that bothers you.)The acting in this film is really first rate, with Cillian Murphy giving an emotionally compelling performance. As in most Boyle films, the camera work also is exceptional and in the first part we are shown some phenomenal long shots of an evacuted London with a soundtrack devoid of sound. The effect is gooseflesh raising. Boyle also adds in other nice touches, like a bunch of goldfish swimming in about five inches of water. (Symbolism?) And a scene with wild horses is another fine moment.The story too goes beyond what we might expect. We get the jumps associated with zombie films - they come out of no where and travel in packs - and yet the heroes don't come off too much better. One character suggests that the virus, by killing off humankind, returns things to normalcy. Christopher Eccleston, a terrific actor, retorts that before the virus man killed man and now he's still doing it. So what's changed? The film also suggests that to save yourself, you would have to kill anyone - child, adult; family member, stranger. And these characters do. But what's noteworthy is we see how having to make those sorts of decisions affects them, particularly Jim.Like Lord of the Flies, the film strips away the civility we all think we possess and demonstrates that we, too, are bound by the laws of the animal kingdom - it's survival of the fittest and to have a future we need to reproduce.Another reviewer said the film fell apart after the first 45 minutes when, in fact, I felt it only got stronger. The last half of the film proved to be very intense. Garland truly raised the stakes.If you enjoy your scares with a bit more thought to them, ""28 Days Later"" won't disappoint. (And if you do, try these similar films - ""12 Monkeys,"" ""Quiet Earth"" and ""Lord of the Flies."")",28 Days Later...
604,Radu_Vladislas,"A very nice entry to the British horror movie scene, and to the horror genre as a whole!.",9,13 May 2007,"I loved this movie from the get go, what with the whole idea of an apocalyptic vision of Britain, and the inclusion of ""The Infected"" running around as well wiping out, or infecting, all remains of human existence they find. It thrills me even to this day.The atmosphere in the movie gives off the feeling of there really being no more hope for those spared the initial outbreak, and killing spree, caused by those infected with a rage virus. It makes you feel as if you're vastly out numbered and in danger no matter where you go or where you hide.The ghost town like London was executed well, well enough to fool you into thinking ""how could they make this happen"", we get over turned buses and abandoned cars and fully desolate streets (no sound what so ever). It's creepy, if viewed in the right frame of mind. Movies like this and Hot Fuzz and also Dog Soldiers and The Descent makes you proud of the British movie industry, instead of ashamed of it. Very entertaining movies they are as well. Unlike Hollywood where they remake classic after classic and Americanise foreign horror movies in the current rut they are in. Instead of being original to some extent!.Well done, Danny Boyle, and the rest of his crew for a job well done.",28 Days Later...

People seeking your usual zombie horror fluff will be very disappointed, whereas those seeking something fresh, dark, and intelligent will be greatly pleased.The film takes place in England where a virus referred to simply as Rage has killed off most of the people, turning them into violent, mindless beings. This serves as a backdrop to the real story, which is about survival during threatening times for man, and how we humans can rely on no one but ourselves to survive.It's a dark, harrowing film that should hold the interest of anybody looking for something with a different style and scope than is usually found in modern-day horror.

I'm not sure I've seen too many plots in zombie films (other than R.E. of course); but this one is really entertaining to watch.  btw, liked all the 'digital deletions' of life... GREAT effect.I don't know if I was more fearful of the zombies or the 'human' (major quotations!!!) soldiers.  It was a point well taken, shedding a light on the darker side of humanity in the face of anarchy.The performances were quite well done, too.  It's nice to see lesser known talent make a thrust into mainstream, drab films of late.

608,Avenge85,RaRaRaRaRAGE!,8,17 April 2003,"Congratulations are in order for Danny Boyle and Alex Garland! The director and writer of '28 Days Later' have ran-free from the trap known as 'The Beach' - an earlier film which both had cooperated - stirring worry into the minds of 'Shallow Grave' and 'Trainspotting' fans.This British film opens with a completely deserted scene of London (similar to that of New York in 'Vanilla Sky')at dawn, when the protagonist 'Jim' is waking in a hospital bed (completely naked) from a coma. The story follows Jim trying to get-to-grips with this new reality, making the 'Real World' of 'The Matrix' seem petty in comparison. Jim (with the aid of a Pepsi endorsement)learns more about the genetically-engineered virus simply called 'Rage' and how it can be transferred via bodily fluid (blood, saliva etc.) converting the unfortunate party into a 'super-zombie' capable of much more than merely groaning and biting (which they still do - only faster.)With the help of 'Selena' (who 'Jim' falls in love with) he avoids contracting 'Rage' and fights to stay alive by raiding shops for food and joining a military camp - defending themselves from 'the infected.'For the budget allotted - this film was brilliant with a variety of surprises, laughs and moments of silent tension.Life ain't a beach when you are being persued by running, climbing and jumping zombies. Only Mr DiCaprio (from 'The Beach') can deter them!Can you survive the 28 days!",28 Days Later...
609,madisongraves,Woa!,10,22 July 2003,"It's been a few weeks since I've seen this magnificent film, so I have had some much needed time to recover from the aftershock - and I have been able to reflect upon its many layers. My brother said that although he thoroughly enjoyed the movie, he didn't find it scary at all, so maybe it just depends on the person - but I think this film was one of the most horrifying experiences. Probably because it could really happen and probably because Boyle did not use cartoon like computer monsters, but real people and real ideas to send goose bumps up your spine. The cast was absolutely charming and they kept you completely engaged every second of this creepy yet visually and emotionally satisfying film. I have to say, I've been impressed with the movies this summer (although technically this was originally released in 2002) -- and this one is no exception! Of course I could only expect a lot when I learned Boyle directed it - he has a gift for hypnotizing his film viewers, and I certainly am not immune to his powers - nor do I want to be!""28 Days Later"" opens with animal activists who free caged apes - little do they know that the monkeys are no ordinary monkeys, but monkeys with a contagious disease. The film follows Cillian Murphy's character after he wakes up in a hospital, naked as the day he was born, to find London evacuated due to an infectious rage among its people that has ravaged the city, as well as other parts of the globe -how far and to what extent we, the audience member, never really learn. But that's not important - the scenario is instantly believable and we are enthralled with the plot right from the get go. The thought that each one of us, stripped away from rational by a simple illness, can turn into a murderous savage is a hard one to stomach - but also a very intriguing one that can inquire us to determine how far our morals really go when there is no society and when there are only two options - death or survival. So even if you are a horror flick veteran and an infected won't freak you out - this movie is not one to miss and not one to be taken lightly!",28 Days Later...
610,Eli_Cash,"Its all the Rage, Not the Hype.",7,1 July 2003,"It truly bothers me that many viewers of this film do not find its contents frightening.  Or that they find elements of the plot and structure in similar styled movies which preceded it.An honest interpretation of this film destroys both of these false conceptions.  It wasn't formed seemlessly in a vacuum.  _28 Days Later..._ does indeed pay homage to the heroes of its genres whether they be the apocalyptic or more straight forward horror. This is not to say that it doesn't spin these themes around on their heads and give them us something provocatively new.Quite simply, _28 Days Later..._ takes one of the most numbingly frightening aspects of our contemporary culture, that of blind, irrational, and implacable hatred and lets it destroy the world or most of it.  Sure its an infection but lets be quick to the point here, there's a reason its called rage.  No longer are the 'zombies' the dead ghouls rising to plague the living.  No, these 'zombies' are very much alive, exaggeratedly so, ruthlessly fast and completely indiscriminate in their destruction.  The only thing they can actively discern apparently is who doesn't share their boundless blood-lust.  And all they want to do is pass it on.Ironically the dead are the only ones at peace and the living no longer need their help finding ways to die.This film does have its flaws (I did give it a 7 after all) but not detriments such as shameless unoriginality or lack of terror.  At times it can be a bit heavy-handed, delivering its morals with a listless dull thump, exactly the kind of strikes I remember _Night of the Living Dead_ zombies making, which makes them all the more unacceptable now that Boyle has decided to usurp such creatures.  The latter third of the film, the Manchester-third (without giving anything substantial away) is far from subtle and can be a bit tedious.  Thankfully the breath-taking opening and terrific middle portions will be remembered for what they are and payed homage to in the future in their own right.",28 Days Later...
611,Geronimo2900,"Whilst there are minor weaknesses, a lot of this film is stunning",8,19 April 2010,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is, fairly uncontroversially, Danny Boyle's most well received film - but, whilst I did enjoy that film, I felt that this had a lot more in common with ""Sunshine"", another of Boyle's films, and was all the better for it. Both centre around a focal group of people who are hugely isolated and are having to deal with trauma and death, but also play with both philosophy and art. Regarding the former of these two, the idea of what life is actually worth living for is a prevalent theme and the ideas of utilitarianism, and the savagery of the actual humans (not the zombies) are also called into question and help make this film more than just a drama/horror. There are times when one can even question whether the premise of the film is exploring the idea of isolation, with the zombie element simply being a means to allow this (although I think believing the zombies to be an afterthought to the philosophy would be a little naive on my part).The latter of the similarities is the artistic element to the film. Thrilling action camera shots and the use of Point Of View camera work make the film highly engaging, but are juxtaposed beautifully by the shots of the emptiness what was once the bustling city of London, with the lone figure of Cillian Murphy (who is very compelling as Jim and is yet another similarity between Sunshine and 28) emphasising the epic nature of the images. Musically, John Murphy (I think my final similarity to Sunshine) provides a beautiful score (""In the house, in a heartbeat"" being particularly powerful). I thought some of the acting was a little weak (namely Megan Burns' 'Hannah', but also some of the army 'banter' was pretty unconvincing - maybe due to poor writing), and I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the ending, but I still highly recommend this film (and Sunshine!) to those who were wary of it simply being a zombie flick; it really is a lot more.",28 Days Later...

614,BradleyUK,my expectations were met....well almost,8,19 June 2003,"I waited in anticipation for this movie after seeing the brilliant, comic style posters and a few publicity shots of a deserted London.My expectations were high, and for once my expectations were met.well almostThe opening scene of a baron & silent London is one of the most disturbing pieces of film I have watched. Anyone who has visited these landmarks will understand how these shots leave the viewer experiencing the fear and confusion the characters are going through. And I know the idea has been used before but, the plot of a virus wiping out humanity couldn't have come at a more poignant time with talk of chemical weapons & virus attacks making the headlines. The story starts to evolve into a wonderful Sci-Fi thriller until they get to the Army Blockade and this is the point were the film Losses itself, luckily only for a short time. The arrival of the Army seems to herald the arrival of a whole new film. Now I love the way it progresses from an apocalyptic Sci-Fi flic to Action horror, yet I can see why many people find the jump in plot a bit hard to swallow. The energy & pace of the 2nd half  is completely different to the 1st  and this sudden change although crucial to the story is hard for the viewer to comprehend. A lot of reviewers have also commented on how shooting with digital video gives a cheap feel to the picture but look carefully at how beautiful the giant drops of rain look when the main character starts his fight back, Im sure you'll agree it only enhances the feel of a dark, desolate world.The change in tempo is the only set back of the film, but I really can't see how else the story could have been moved on.

The tag line is an accurate review already. So, what is the basis of this movie? we have the jammy bloke who gets locked in the friendly local hospital and wakes up a month later to find London, and the rest of the England desolate. The accuracy of an empty London is quite literally, breathtaking (At a severe risk of sounding strange) Then his lucky butt is saved by bad ass survivors, from there they find other survivors and head up north.Its an amazing watch and at not one point do you look away from the screen and think 'Could i be doing something better right now?' because, even when the zombies aren't around, it is still a very gripping film.This is, without a doubt a modern day classic, not just as a zombie film, but as a cinematic great. It utterly reinvents zombie films for this generation, perhaps forever. With not a moment lacking action.One thing that stands out more than anything else during the film is the incredibly good character development, which is constantly and highly visible throughout the movie. The best examples of this is how the two main characters develop feelings for each other, and not in the cliché Shakespeare way. As well as Jims growth from timid newcomer to the group, to zombie slaying ass kicker.All in all its a thrilling film brimmed with explosive scenes and realistic effects, add the great drama and plot and you have yourself a classic, a classic named 28 Days Later",28 Days Later...

619,Garp23,Timely horror,7,29 January 2004,"Every summer, the news media pounds a story or series of stories into the ground until that season is known for it. Consider a couple of summers ago, which was the summer of shark attacks. Or the recent summer of child abductions. In reality, there were not more shark attacks or child abductions in their respective summers, but the media grabbed a couple of high profile cases and built trends around them (road and air rage media circuses also apply here, very fittingly). 2003 will probably remembered as the summer of SARS and monkeypox, which makes it the perfect summer in which to see `28 Days Later'. As the story opens, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes from a coma in a locked London hospital room and finds it deserted, the key to his room shoved under the door. In a series of amazing shots, he wanders by Big Ben and through Piccadilly Circus and finds no one. He does find walls plastered with missing persons photos that immediately bring 9/11 to mind (although the film was made before then). He finally finds three people who bring him up to date: a vicious virus was accidentally unleashed by animal rights activists freeing specimens from an Army facility. The virus is blood borne, and if you're infected, you will be dead in twenty seconds. Those infected are overcome with rage, attack those around them, and vomit infected blood everywhere. Get this blood in an orifice or wound, and you've got twenty seconds yourself. In twenty-eight days, England has been wiped out. This sounds like one of Romero's living dead movies (but since the writer wrote the book and movie `The Beach' and the director, Danny Boyle, is responsible for `Trainspotting', there is no doubt an anti-drug subtext here) with one major difference: these zombies are fast. They move like lightening, although they do nothing more than infect the living, not devour them. This virus is not a smart one; without sustenance, the world will be quickly wiped out, and the virus with it. The first third of the movie, the discovery phase, plays like `Night of the Living Dead'. The second third, wherein four survivors search for others, plays like `Dawn of the Dead' (including a deliberate homage, a shopping trip). The end finds them in a military base, like the one in `Day of the Dead', right down to the zombie tied up for experimental purposes. But Boyle did not make a mere horror movie here. This is social commentary with a pulse, fast and furious, and it will put you on the edge of your seat. It's shot in grainy digital video for a documentary feel, and the camera struggles to keep up with the action when it occurs. You think you see more than you do: the savage flashes of marauding monsters will make you shrink away from the screen, but the gore is minimal. Boyle overreaches somewhat; horror fans will no doubt jones for more outright scares, and the audience that would love dissecting the film will be put off by the graphic violence and tone. The cast is game, with Naomie Harris strong as the seemingly tough chick and Brendan Gleeson sympathetic as a concerned but gruff father. Everyone digs deep and seems real enough to make you care, a rare trait in a horror movie, even an arty one. It will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever seen a movie that the military folks are up tp no good (although I would have never guessed their sinister plot), so as the film rachets up the tension, building towards the climax, it actually loses creativity. The shocks here are among the best in the film, but we can feel it running out of speed. Watch the scene with the rats in the pitch black tunnel; that is the kind of nail-biter the last part of the film should have delivered. And the actual finale seems a little too upbeat for such a dark vision; it jars with everything that has come before it. Boyle has said that the movie is about Jim's search for a father figure, but that message is obscured by the seeming prescience of current events the film achieves. Strap in and read into `28 Days Later' whatever you wish to; there's enough here for everyone.",28 Days Later...

I intensely dislike anyone who evaluates a movie in those terms. It is indicative of an inferiority complex in the individual. One should never bring their provincialism into the arena when evaluating any work of art. It reeks of low class.This movie started off ridiculously.

Thats about the only line for the first 15 minutes, just repeated again and again while our hero (Jim) desperately wanders the empty streets of London looking for signs of life. But without any luck. Though, at a point where Jim is walking down a long road, yelling as a hooligan, you suddenly see a person in the distance walking towards him and the camera. Then cut. And in the next scene you see Jim walking down another road, still yelling ""HALOOOOO!!"" and still totally alone. Now, what happened to the dude at the other end of the road? Who is Jim really looking for? Wasn't he good enough for Jim to team up with? OR was it that the dude shouldn't have been there at all in the first place? I think the last is the most obvious, and i find that totally hilarious. But i think the funniest part, in this deadly serious movie, is where our heroes (yes Jim manage to see other people) has stopped in a tunnel, and one of them says something like ""Hey, can you hear something?"", and then you see about 2 dozen ""zombies"" in all ages come sprinting down the dark tunnel. I'm telling you, i was so close to laugh my guts out in the cinema while thinking "" oh ooh, here comes the insane joggers"". Coz what i find so damn funny is, that from Jims first encounter with the infected lunatic people, they don't ever stop running their butts off. Whats the hurry?? But besides the minor blooper at the beginning of the movie, the first 20-30 minutes of this Zombie-like horror flick is far the best. I found the rest of the movie, though driving many miles, to go nowhere. Its sad, because it starts with some good promises where you think ""this could get really scary"". But no!

Seen this before? You are bound to have. With the increasing popularity of the zombie genre, it can often feel like you've watched a zombie flick before it has barely begun. However, for this very reason, a lot of the more recent zombie movies try to add something unique to their movie to make it stand out of the crowd. For this particular movie, the repeated use of hope as a factor that keeps the characters fighting on, has worked out really well. The movie also adds an additional danger, just as the characters starts to feel safe from the infected, to make sure the viewers stays at the edge of their seat.Why should you watch this movie?Well the characters are very all very well done, and in spite of the relatively low budget this movie had, the characters are very believable. Cillian Murphy does a great job as Jim, the main character, who goes through the process of being completely unaware of what has happened around him, to becoming a strong yet vengeful man.

624,iain_connell,You'll feel like a zombie by the end,2,11 February 2005,"What a shame that a the first British film for a long time to make substantial use of central London (and which must have been difficult and costly to set up) should fall so far flat after the first few minutes. The film's premise is that a virus with a very (and I mean very) short incubation period has broken out of a research laboratory and has rampaged across the country in just 28 days, killing most of the population and leaving the rest as zombies (sorry, it's not a zombie film, it's a parable about epidemiology) who rage and scream and just want to infect the survivors.Well, in even trying to describe the premise you can see where it begins to collapse. Why do the (non-)zoms want to infect the healthy, when there's nothing in it for them and they're going to die ? (If they don't die, the country's population would still all be running and jumping around, and there wouldn't have been the Omega Man scenario at the start, would there ?) How long does it take for the Infected (for that's what they are called, friends turning to fiends in seconds) to snuff it ? If the infected only come out to play after nightfall (or so it seems from the opening sequence), why do they later chase about in the daytime ?I do like zombie films, really I do, and Trainspotting and Shallow Grave. But Danny Boyle's grasp of pacing, dialogue and character development seems to have deserted him this time. We get a series of unconnected lurches from good guy to bad guy, healthy to infected, alive to dead, with nary a consistent theme or underlying thread to hold our attention or suspend disbelief. And in any kind of post-apocalypse scenario, zom-fest (sorry there I go again) or just plain horror film, that is precisely what we need to do. The attempts to portray group bonding among the fugitive survivors are so bad that we just don't care what happens to them. Even Christopher Eccleston is uncertain how to play his role (as well he might be), coming over as neither sane nor demented (he's supposed to have gone mad, what with all the killing) but directionless. And as for the rest of the squaddies in his bunch of military survivors, the least said the better.There is just one memorable scene, after the man-wakes-up-in-deserted-London opener. A taxi drives along an empty motorway with a burning city (Manchester) in the distance, to Fauré's Requiem. And Cillian Murphy is clearly a lot better than this nonsensical ragbag of a film suggests. Fast editing, blood vomiting and over-used profanities do not a lasting impression make, and I've forgotten most of it already.

625,BSideleau,"Great, modern classic",10,4 April 2005,"A complete first (successfully at least) for a ""zombie""(these guys aren't dead though) movie- it's serious and it works incredibly well. The acting is fantastic, the camera work is menacing as hell and the the core theme is razor-sharp in delivery. Danny Boyle is a genius, he can go from making one of the best comedy/dramas ever (Trainspotting), to making the best ultra-serious Zombie film ever, and recently made a family film called millions which I hear is fantastic. This films final chapter is mind blowing, especially the scene in which Jim (possibly infected in the mind of Selena) savagely crushes that marine guy's skull. The music in that scene, coupled with the camera work and acting= one of the greatest moments in modern horror film history in my opinion.",28 Days Later...
626,sean3240,Surprisingly good,9,1 February 2021,"I streamed this movie years ago and watched maybe the first 20 minutes before I turned it off because the version I saw was very low resolution and had awful sound, I had assumed it was just a bad standard definition version of the film and decided to just wait till I found a better version.
It wasn't till now years later that I got the film on blu ray and to my disappointment it's just as bad looking and sounding as it was the first time I saw it. Framing of high-action sequences was pretty bad, particularly early on in the film, they mainly consisted of unclear shots, quick cuts and shaky cam, meaning you can barely see what's going on. This was most likely to hide a lack of blocking and choreographing for the scenes.
The film is in dire need of a remaster, if it's even possible to improve the quality of what was shot.But enough of that complaining.
If your film is well written, with good characters and directed well in places that it matters, then I don't care how bad your film looks. And this film was all those things.Directing was great in terms of keeping the tone consistent, pacing the movie well, keeping things engaging and building tension slowly and effectively. Even though the cameras were awful, the cinematography still managed to be pretty great, that ominous feeling of an empty London was conveyed perfectly.Performances were great all round, I was really invested in each of these characters, Brendan Gleeson did particularly well.I wasn't expecting for it to wrap up its themes, characters and story so well at the end.

628,benatarandres,A return to Normalcy,7,19 May 2016,"One of the core concepts of human nature is our propensity to survive, most often through dire measures. Whatever way we manage to cheat death, or delay the inevitable, the drastic measures taken bring us towards a greater fear and significant contradiction. The film's presentation, although less cynical than his previous film Trainspotting, is equally grim in perspective as director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland tackle the subject of human survival, within the confines of an issue that rivals the controversies surrounding nuclear annihilation and global warming awareness. With biological warfare, 28 days Later paints a brutal and terrifying vision of a world that is merely a reflection of our own ignorance. After the outbreak of an infectious virus called ""Rage"", the population of London is crippled. In merely four weeks, the population has ceased, with very few people left, and the infected running rampant as they resort to the more primal aspects of human behavior, going further back to our own ancestors. The infected hide among the bodies of the dead, the shadows of abandoned buildings, and within the very darkness that the resourceful survivors will be hesitant to venture. With only four survivors, Jim (Murphy), an every man of the sorts, having just woken up from a coma, Selina (Hariss) a ruthless and determined survivor embodying a coldness to her drive, Frank (Gleeson) and Hannah (Burns) a father and Daughter dependent on each other, journey into the whole of Manchester. Their journey is in search of what a radio announcement called ""The Answer to infection"", when really it was a prime example of humanities resilience, and it's more prevalent and damaging ignorance when merely seeking survival above all else. After acquainting themselves with the resourceful, but morally questionable Major Henry (Eccleston), the survivors find themselves in conflict with a group of soldiers, who's own drive to survive not only decimates and destroys their conceptions of morality, but further poses the question as to what is normal, when really that is just a word, and based on a concept we invented. Now with regards to the reasons we took it upon ourselves to establish such a concept was no doubt a prejudice that further reflects our complete lack of knowledge in comparison to a Universe that is vastly more intelligent than we are. The human species has walked this Earth for about several hundred thousand years. There is no exact estimate, and people like the Geneticist Francis Collins, or the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins have their own approximations ranging from a hundred to two hundred and fifty thousand years since homo-sapiens emerged. Regardless of which one it is, be it more or less, out of the 4.6 billion years in which the Earth has existed, and the total 13 billion years since the Universe originated, human kind's emergence pales in comparison to such magnitude. If we were to suddenly up and vanish through some means of extinction, then that would be a merely be a return to what we call normalcy. This sort of philosophical speculation is expressed within the calm and quaint remarks of a rather wise and spiritual sergeant ( McQuarrie) within West's brutish and stagnantly ignorant unit of young soldiers. It is sad to know, but honest in such introspection within our existence. Whether it be it by divine authorship, or an accidental result of the big bang, we've only been here for a short time, and it's even harder to say how long that will last, or even if its normal to accept that it will most likely eventually end. Darwinian evolution by natural selection, although resilient in sexual selection and competitive amongst other organisms, is not always directional nor meant for adaptive evolution in matters as destructive and as incomprehensible as bio warfare. Even when a species such as ours is able to adapt to our surroundings, so do the very parasites that place us within the verge of a viral epidemic. Be it either the foot disease, the bubonic plague, or the passing of one organism to another. The sadness of it all is more conceived within our inability to determine the future outcome of when it will happen, rather than by what means. 28 Days Later envisions that potential outlook, be it within the desolated streets of London, the collapse of a societal infrastructure, and the chaotic/nihilistic portrayal of human destruction through desperation. Along with the lessons presented within the film, viewers obviously felt enthralled the by the horror aspect, mixed with the Apocalyptic vision of a world we are not very far from. Also the depiction of the infected was brilliant with them being more primal and ravage in their nature, then the typically dry and mindless monsters you get in a horror flick, thus exploring the notion of human nature, and how our more behavioral standards are a result of our evolution. An excellent amount of praise goes to the principal actors, Murphy, Harris, Gleeson, Burns, and Eccelston as they each exemplify the many forms of contradiction within the human animal, attempting to make sense of and rebuild a world that could easily become a reality, merely out of the very lack of understanding that characterizes human thinking when tackling higher playing fields of universal knowledge.",28 Days Later...

Those who had seen it told me it didn't really fit into any conventional category.  ""Apocalyptic"" was one adjective I'd heard.  That about fits the bill, if not blatantly obvious.It is most definitely unlike any film I've seen before.  I loved the gritty effect of video, especially the scenes that took place in the rain.  The camera shake, shutter speeds, and frame rate effects all added to the ""horror"" aspect of the movie.  I was afraid that since it was a dark film, the picture quality would suffer due to the video.  No worries at all.  The medium was used very effectively.I was impressed with the shots of quiet London and the abandoned motorways. I can't imagine all the headaches that caused while filming.  It kind of makes you wonder ""what if?""During the climax of the film, I was startled by a loud crunching sound nearby.  It turned out to be the empty water bottle I had inadvertently crushed in my sweaty hand!  That's how much this movie dragged me in.The theatre here showed the alternate ending (the original, I'm told) after the closing credits.

This film makes you jump many times but once you have got used to the formula about half way through you probably will start to hope for some meaning or message. If you do you will be disappointed...its just one of those movies that says 'all we have to do is survive' and that means killing a lot of zombies. There's some terrible acting from the young girl and some really offensive cliches that make most army types out to be potential rapists. The ending can be easily guessed and some of the supposedly poignant moments are just rubbish - watching some horses frolicking stands out as particularly pathetic. If you like shock/horror stuff then you will like this but its ultimately pointless throwaway stuff.

631,DocM,Well made and yet inexplicably given away,7,13 June 2003,"Contains minor spoilers!The movie appears to be well-made. The story and some of the shooting - especially the silent London streets - are pretty disturbing, especially in today's context of ever-present threads of new diseases or acts of terror. It doesn't matter that you have seen the theme tens of times before - I am a legend, Mad Max, etc. And yet,  you get the feeling that the movie has been given away.  It doesn't know what it wants.  The turn from an apocalyptic zombie shocker to the psychology of a small group of survivors with about 15 men and 2 women appears strangely unmotivated.  The story contains tons of logical flaws (Don't they have tons of bridges in London? Why do they absolutely have to cross the river through a tunnel??) and the (rather simple) happy end is somewhat disappointing... The movie also proves that digital shooting (I don't know what specific technology was used here, maybe it wasn't the best) can still not cope even with smaller screens,  the pan-shot across the houses of parliament makes Big Ben dance back and forth across the pixels...And yet - it is not a movie to see and forget,  it's capturing and keeps you thinking for days. 7/10",28 Days Later...

This is a truly terrible film, made all the worse by having seen Donnie Darko the day before. The juxtaposition of Darko (an excellent film) and this pile of utter tosh was nearly too much for me to take. Luckily I had had the foresight to carry a note-pad and pen with me and duly spent the vast majority of the film playing noughts and crosses with myself, lest I fall into a boredom-induced coma. My only other respite was seeing - unfortunately far too few of - the main characters come to grievous bodily harm. But the most damning indictment of this film is that it would have been a vast improvement if it had been shot as a musical, directed by Mel Brooks and starring Tom Hanks, Kevin Costner, Gwyneth Paltrow and Nicole Kidman.

635,Robert R Jackson,Requiem for Mini-DV,10,5 July 2003,"This may be the pinnacle of Mini-DV. In the past few years a number of directors have tried their hands at making feature films using Mini-DV and each has had a different vision of how the medium is best used. Mostly, though, they've all tried to exploit it as a nimble and cost-effective alternative to film. With this movie the medium is used for its unique visual appeal and the cinematographer and editor have worked together to exploit those qualities in a way I haven't seen anyone else work. Years from now I feel like this will come to be regarded as the high-water mark for Mini-DV. Now that High Definition consumer camcorders are starting to become available for about the same price as Mini-DV I think the days of the Mini-DV feature are numbered, but leave it to Danny Boyle to show everyone else how it could be done.Danny Boyle brings us an $8 million zombie movie where every penny is up on the screen. The acting is all top-notch. The locations are all well-considered. In the middle of another summer full of swollen special-effecs films, Danny Boyle brings us the antithesis of hollow summer fare. Here's a film where the story and the performances are more important than the special effects budget or starpower and the end result is a movie that outclasses efforts with 20 times its budget.
Finally, there's the place in history this project earns as a zombie movie. Ever since George Romero wanted to make I Am Legend, couldn't acquire the rights and changed the vampires to zombies, we've had sort of an international zombie underground. Eventually, even a remake of I Am Legend decided to follow Romero's lead and The Omega Man featured its own variant of zombies. This project falls into the techno- zombie category of films like The Omega Man and Warning Sign and it proves to be the best contribution to the genre in decades. Boyle has given the world its first great zombie movie of the new millennium. Thanks Danny.",28 Days Later...

And the virus contained by them, known as the 'infection' quickly spreads throughout the UK, where the story takes place. The protagonist Jim wakes up in a hospital from what seems to be a comma, with no one around. Shortly, he realizes that he is the only one there. But when put to the test of life-or-death, he manages to survive with the help of others the attack of the infected.Every year, the movie industry comes out with movies that makes you just think...""Why did they even make this?"". Well not 28 days later. This British 'zombie' flick has many of the needed qualities to make a good scary movie. It has good acting by the leads Cillian Murphy AKA Jim, and Naomie Harris AKA Selena. And the talents these actors contribute to the movie is definitely good thing. With distinctive personalities and relatable qualities, you really root for the characters. With an interesting plot that thickens when the main character steps into the almost un-real world of the time after the ""infection"" started. Jim keeps the story going with the curiosity of this phenomenon. And the duel antagonists counter each other yet both contribute to Jim's struggle, and keeps you wanting more. The scares are very scary, weather it's pop-out-at-you scary, or just teeth-clenching scary. Even the obvious ones, just psych you out more knowing that something scary is going to happen. With different ways of showing something scary, this scare-factor is fresh and out there, yet it works fantastically. This has your heart racing from the beginning and never lets off. This movie will seriously draw you in, and have you literally screaming at the characters to keep going when they are in danger. I've seen good horror's, but nothing similar that is as good as this. No twist ending, but for-sure an ending worth seeing. The over-all job done on this movie is amazing and seems to have very good direction. Everyone should give this movie a chance.

It has truly brought the zombie horror back from the dead. The infected and the virus are believable and scary because you never know what those scientists are up to these days... The only downside was the fact that it was only Britain infected (a soldier says that England was quarantined). It would have been a lot scarier if the world was infected because there would be nowhere to run.

639,vanhelsing19,"Tense, scary and no it's NOT a zombie movie",9,28 January 2011,"28 Days Later is not a zombie film, well it is sort of...OK it's not... It takes a clever twist on the traditional Romero films and instead of the dead coming back from hell (because there's no more space) instead these fellows are filled with rageThink traffic jam on a hot day and the air con is broken or you're married to Lena Headey (only to wake up and realise it was just a dream). Anyway Beautifully directed by Danny Boyle in essence it's a survivalist tale with some gruesome scenes and Lord of the Files morality. The landscape of England is a brutally scared and this disturbing setting for the film is shot gloriously with digital hand held cameras. Boyle also chooses to strip some of the colour out of some shots and enhance it in others. Indeed, the film boasts some startling imagery - most notably Jim on a deserted Westminster Bridge at rush hour, Jim wandering London's City and West End, the group driving up an empty M6 and greeted by a burning Manchester (Boyle's home town). If by that particular scene Boyle hasn't managed to drown you with a tangible sense of hopeless and bleakness you're probably already dead The story revolves around several survivors of the virus (which is passed by fluids)and their attempt to find shelter and safety in the ravaged landscape of Britain. I don't want to spoil it too much for you but the plot ticks along nicely within various vignettes along the way. The highlight is the ending with John Murphy's amazing piece of music 'In the house – in a heartbeat' which you will recognise no doubt without me even describing it to you. The final scene in the house ranks in my top 20 film scenes of all time.Cillian Murphy, looking disturbingly sickly and pale, plays Jim, the hero to the story. Murphy is terrific in this role because he is very believable and human – clearly there was no temptation to cast him as some action hero – in fact for most of the film just the opposite – a superb decision by Boyle. Naomie Harris plays Selena, another survivor who ends up teamed up with Jim after saving his life. Megan Burns plays the young girl and Brendan Gleeson is her father Frank; they make up the small band of survivors. Mention to should be made of Christopher Eccleston (as an army major) who appears towards the latter 1/3 and is chillingly competent.Oh yes and less we forget 'the infected' which are beautifully made up and move with a grace that reminded me of how James Cameron had the Aliens move. Very different from Romeros zombies; rem these aren't Zombies? but the infected can move quickly, if a little randomly and occasionally spurt blood ala The Exorcist. It's not without a couple of minor flaws but the film is a very good British horror film – yanks might wonder 'why don't they all have guns' or 'why is there no scary build up music to tell us when something is going to happen' but that is because this is a British film and not a Hollywood one...",28 Days Later...

!SPOILERS!
Yes, some very cool and original things, like the coma storyline, Selena's take out of her partner in the house, the rats and of course the empty streets.But then again, for a national capitol's streets to be SO empty, soon became 'false' - I found myself thinking ""Where is Everybody!!!"" like that airline commercial.  Not good.  I mean if the infected are alive, then it would stand to reason that when they attacked, some of their victims would be killed and there would be a lot more corpses about.  Not to mention abandoned cars.  Finally, the city would be burning in a lot of places.The opening sequence in the lab was ridiculously lame as were the Director's comments about his ""statement"" about the virus.I like Brendan Gleeson, and actually thought the characters were as cool as those in similar movies.  But a bicycle messenger's miraculous transformation into a soldier killing machine had me groaning.As for the infected? REALLY disappointing.  When they stopped chasing the cab at the end of the tunnel sequence, I realized these 'monsters' are pussies.Easy to kill, the only scary things about them are that they ambush and they are super contagious.  So why use edged implements like machetes with the STATED risk of getting blood in the mouth?  Apparently the writer couldn't be bothered with his own movie's logic or continuity.Don't get me started with the whole ""Army Guys"" as bad guys cliché. Ho-freakin-hum. Been there done that too often - Day of the Dead, Night of the Comet etc etc etc.I suppose if I were female the whole ""Joy Division"" concept would have personally been more rattling, but by this point in the film, I was just waiting for it to end.I just HATED the whole campout at the church ruins scene, from the insipid horses to the Valium nonsense to the complete breakdown of the character/circumstantial logic.  I mean drugging yourself to sleep in the wide open when there are INFECTED running about???  Then the way they offed Brendan Gleeson's character...As I type this I realize that anything I liked was just the occasional cool scene or concept that shored up a lot of rather uninteresting, repetitive and ultimately disappointing story.And the endings? ALL OF THEM SH_TE!The best thing I can say about this is that having bought it on DVD I can trade it in for credit.I chalk this one up in that same bewildering category as The Ring.  My sister and I were literally RAISED on horror films, we watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre as KIDS.My wife and her friends got nightmares from watching The Ring.  My sis and I got bored.  How anyone could be frightened by a soggy chick crawling out of a TV set is beyond me.  It was stupid in Videodrome and Shocker, it is stupid here.  But I digress.I really can't fault anyone for liking ANY movie; I certainly like some films that are greatly disdained.  And in the end it is only opinion.And in my opinion, if all I can expect these days for horror is The Ring, 28 Days Later, Resident Evil, The Others, House of a Thousand Corpses and the BEST is Dawn of the Dead 2004, then I must sadly conclude that horror as a genre is DEAD.  I liked Dawn of the Dead 2004, but it is an anomaly and only very good not great.How freaking sad.",28 Days Later...

I was completely wrong, while it does have some of the elemnts from those films, this film is light years ahead of them. I found it to be interesting, thought provoking and very intertaining. Every film has faults, and I would consider this film as to having only a few (my biggest gripe is that infections take 10-15 seconds...no virus moves that fast..but hey it is Hollywood, or Londonwood, whatever). One striking point that I find interesting that no one has hit on it yet is the fact that the one group of 'cilivized' people we find in the story has literally lowered themselves to barbaric levels in our to survive. The major says he has pulled these men together by promising them a reward of plenty of women! To make them civilized and organized he has to promise them a reward of plenty of woemn to have their way with. So the root moral out of this movie that I got, was that even when we are reduced to the barest levels of our morality, we will still be nothing more than animals. Anyway, I found this movie to be much better than I thought it could be.

In 28 days the entire planet has the infection. now Jim (the main character) and his soon to be girlfriend Selena have to escape from all of these flesh-eating zombies. however they soon meet a father, frank, and his daughter, Hannah. who have a car and they all go on a car trip into the country. They're driving in one of the most beautiful sceneries i've ever seen. it tops the movie off! i don't want to give the ending away, but I'll tell you one thing.....it's awesome. thank you Boyle!oh! by the way...bad boys 2 sucked major!!!",28 Days Later...
647,polle_dreng,great film with minor issues,7,8 July 2017,"Before i start criticizing this movie i wanna tell Danny Boyle did a great job directing this movie. The discomfort feeling of seeing the main lead waking up to nothing, and some of the great emotional scenes trough out the movie. The music was also great and did a lot to add up to this movies atmosphere. Even though the music was great, acting was okay, the cinematography beautiful, the movie still manage to be predictable which is a minor issue in this case because it still manages to entertain people, which is a movies job.",28 Days Later...
648,reggienunez,Scary zombie film from England,7,22 December 2018,"Zombies, when done correctly can scare like the best of monster movies. 28 Days Later is dark, the video quality is dubious (it was shot on digital video to curtail cost and provide a grittier look), and the subject matter is familiar. But the filmmakers counter these questionable qualities with solid performances, an intelligent script, and sure-handed direction. The result is a movie that kept me involved from start to finish. When Boyle wants to shock us, he has no trouble doing so. There's a little of George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead) here. Several scenes in which the infected attack are genuinely creepy. One sequence in particular - in which Jim and Frank race to change a tire while a band of infected relentlessly approach - generates as much tension as any other 2003 motion picture. This is followed in short order by an effective character building sequence in which the protagonists enjoy a picnic while ruminating about what, if anything, the future might hold. Suddenly, Jim and Selena have become aware that the mantra of ""just survive"" is not enough.",28 Days Later...

They are FAST, disgusting, and want to ""eat your brains"" (just kidding). But seriously, if you want to see a great British movie in the likes of ""Lock, Stock..."" or ""Trainspotting"" with great music to reinforce the narrative, this is your horror show!  Some people are disappointed by the ending, but who cares.  The reason they're disappointed is a good one.  People wanted more!  They could have made this a 12 hour epic if they wanted to, and I'd watch every minute of it.

The trailer made me think this movie would be creative and treat one of my favorite horror/sci-fi topics, the ""end of civilization"" story, in a fresh manner.I was very disappointed.  The movie was quite predictable.  The jittery, out-of-focus filming technique was annoying.  The storyline was inconsistent.  Perhaps movies like this will never live up to expectations, because each person's imagination would probably come up with a different scenario.  I place this movie on the same level as ""Night of the Living Dead.""

651,mistajericho,HELLO???? This is a very good movie!!!,10,1 June 2003,"Well where do i start. A week ago i saw the 28 days teaser for the first time on the internet and found it very interesting. But since the movie hasn´t hit the big screen in germany yet, i decided to buy the uk dvd. ( the dvd is pretty good and offers a lot of specials like commentary from the director, deleted scenes, alternate ending, music video...)So what do i think of this movie? This is a very good movie. The atmosphere throughout the whole movie is quite eerie and the soundtrack is simply amazing. Even if you don´t like horror movies and won´t watch 28 days, you should listen to one or two tracks of the soundtrack. The movie starts of in the deserted city of london and the first 15 minutes are Danny Boyle at his best. Man you gotta love the beginning. This is filmmaking on a very high level. Then the ""zombies"" are thrown into the story and you get some nice attack scenes with some minor gore. The zombies are done pretty well and boy, they run so fast that even Lintford Christie would go green with envy. After that we follow a small group of survivors to manchester where they are looking for a group of soldiers who claim that they have found a cure for the devastating virus...
Now i´d like to correct some things which have been said about this film:1. It is NOT!!! a Resident Evil rip off. Although the story might sound a bit similar, 28 days is far superior to the lame resident evil. 2. It has some gore, but it is definitely not as gruesome as many people out there want to make you believe. If you are looking for a bloodbath movie like ""Battle Royale"" stay away from this. 3. The Acting is not a let down. Ok maybe nobody will get away with an oscar here, but they surly act well enough to make the movie work. 4. The second part of the movie is a bit weaker than the first one. But since the first part is close to perfection this comes as no surprise.go and watch this movie or buy the DVD. you won´t regret it.8.5 / 10",28 Days Later...

655,mondo_kane,The First of a New Generation (and you can keep it)...,2,7 June 2005,"When this film was first released in 2002, it was considered by many to be the first wave of a new generation of smart, original horror movies that broke the conventions of an admittedly tired genre. Considering the mountains of praise heaped upon this film it must have worked for some. At it's release it was touted as the future of ""zombie"" movies (though the film doesn't feature a single zombie) and another triumph for director Danny Boyle (who's only talent seems to be for tapping into the zeitgeist-de-jour of the time and churning out dull movies that end up being adored by the readers of the NME and GQ magazine - just look at TRAINSPOTTING).28 DAYS LATER tells a pretty damn formulaic tale of a lone man who wakes up in hospital to discover the London he left behind is a deserted ruin of overturned vehicles and blowing litter. Hiding though in the shadows are a bloodthirsty throng of mindless victims of a accidental viral outbreak. Our lone protagonist finds other survivors and together they attempt to find a safe haven from the contagious horde forever at their backs.So far, so OMEGA MAN. After the predictable deaths along the way, the survivors travel to an apparently safe military compound, only to discover the soldiers there are as desperate as they are and have unpleasant motives of their own, leaving our hero to save his new friends from the dangers within and without.A horror story is only as good as its monsters. The Infected Masses are single-minded beings, existing only to kill and run about howling. They appear not to eat, ignore injury, and enter a kind of torpor during daylight hours. Since these aren't cannibals or animated corpses like most monsters that fit this cinematic ""zombie"" prototype, the ""ugh"" factor comes from the fact they constantly vomit large quantities of infected blood, obviously inspired by real-life diseases like Ebola.On the other hand you have the soldiers, who harbour a plan to collect women, reconstructing ""humanity"" and rebuilding their cabin-fever-shattered mindsets via rape, (all of which is approved of by their commander), leaving us with a tired question of who really is the monster - us civilised humans or the primal screaming horde outside (who are at the end of the day are just us anyway - the kill-or-be-killed instinct hiding under the veneer of ""humanity"" in every one of us) but by this point I didn't care.The story is cliché from moment one, leaving the audience with nothing to cling to but the characters. No bad thing, but the script is dire. Most of the cast do as well as they can with what they have, which includes some serious talent like Eccleston and Murphy, but it's an uphill struggle. The camera-work and editing is frenetic and perfect for MTV viewers, people with ADHD and those who think this is a hallmark of modern cinema and not just irritating. The movie is hip for certain, but clothes do not make the man. Don't even get started on the holes in the plot... most of the time you can forgive such things in horror movies but here they're glaring and obvious.28 DAYS LATER seems to be so much more to its fans, but to me it is no more than yet another sorry collection of horror clichés presented in a way that seems to be original until you realise you've seen every scene before in some other movie, most likely handled better.",28 Days Later...

And after watching 28 Days Later... twice in 6 days, I have no doubt that Danny Boyle is for real!!This movie is not for everyone.  If you can't handle slow beginnings that build to a climax and you need to see action at every turn, go see Charlie's Angels 2.But, if you're tired of seeing the same Hollywood crap over and over. If you want to see how a good story, great acting, and fantastic directing can make up for the huge budgets that are wasted on Hollywood Garbage give this one a try.In my humble opinion (which I know doesn't mean very much) it's the best movie of the year (so far).You made a believer out of me again Danny!

658,professor_asphincter,horror pop video but fantastic all the same.,9,9 January 2003,"This film is one of my faves. It is very fast, slick and clever. Boyle said he wanted to get a ""ken loach"" factor, meaning he wanted great human characters as well as gung-ho action scenes. I think he did this AND still managed to leave us with hundreds of un-answered questions. Just how much of the world has been affected? what will the authorities do when the survivors are picked up? why did the 'infected' co-operate in packs but not attack each other? why did the 'infected' become nocturnal? Why in a city that has been panic-evacuated is the only traffic blockage in a tunnel? If you can suspend yourself long enough to get past these questions and relax into the film you will have a very entertaining time. Hi points include the shopping montage and the first empty walk through london. I also loved the little touches, like the lime pit full of half decomposed bodies, the 9/11 reference in the notice boards covered in 'have you seen....' letters and the fact that the signal to the jet at the end said ""Hello"", rather than the obvious and cliched ""Help"" (they didn't need any)

Its a twist on a Buddhist idea, if a tree falls in a forest does it make a sound, well ""28"" ask what happens if you scream in that per-verbal forest would you be more scared of the monsters are being alone. And if you like your tension built with visual montage's and quick camera movements this is an incredible stimulating movie but its not over done like in Bourne Supremacy. If your tired of movies where the character's all seem to have quirky chatter as if they are more an audience to the movie than they are characters like in Scream, then this is your sort of movie. ""28"" is not a peak-boo horror film, some psycho drama, but its much better because the shocking tension is addictive which means you want to watch it over and over again, if not for the adrenaline shock then for the mediative value.",28 Days Later...

Or possibly some had trouble with the male nudity.********SPOILERS AHEAD*********Well now, after the release of the this horrible infection, known as Rage, the world, 28 days later, has succumb to the disease.  And the infected do not die, they become these horrible creatures, almost in a state of having rabies where they go insane and just attack people.  In comes Jim, someone who wakes in a hospital, naked, and roams this forsaken city, seeing his world in shambles.  Soon he meets up with Selena and another man (who does not matter, trust me).  They then meet up with a father and daughter and go on there way from a radio transmission telling them to go towards a military outpost of some sort.  After reaching it, the outcome grows ugly but in the end their saviors come and the movie closes on a happy note.I loved Jim's performance in this movie and I also thought that the daughter, Hannah, was portrayed quite well.  The characters are believable and they react as anyone would do in those situations.  And for those who complain that this is not a zombie film, well you are right, but I am glad that it is not and that it turned out to be something better than that. It had much more important themes, the most important to me was that even though the world can be ravaged by such a horrible disease, that human beings can still be horrible to each other.  It's true in those times, and it is true now.  Overall, I give this movie a 8 out of 10 and I was glad to watch it.  I will buy it once it comes out.  Until then...later",28 Days Later...

As i see it, most horror movies are.  i must say, however, i thought 28 DAYS LATER was actually a pretty interesting film.  It had a message worth thinking about, and there is enough symbolism in it for JD Salinger to of wrote it.  But i don't understand why they pitched it so heavily as a horror movie.  I kept hearing that same quote ""Scary as Hell.""  but watching it, i didn't find it scary at all.  It was gory and violent at times, but i'd hardly describe it as scary.  Suspense was also a key factor missing from this movie if it was a horror film.  Everytime something bad is going to happen you can see it coming, there is always a warning.  More obviously though, you can see when something isn't coming, the music and mood is way to nice for anything bad to happen.  Which reminds me, there are certain scenes in this movies that you will swear were taken straight from a car commercial.  Note, at the end of the movie, be sure to notice a certain inserted shot, it may get you thinking.  Overall i'd say this movie is worth seeing, and entertaining, but you have to be able to want to think about it, and don't expect a horror flick.  *** of **** stars.",28 Days Later...

666,gcd1707,Genuinely frightening,8,25 April 2004,"Even if you're a cynical movie watcher, I challenge you to watch this movie in a dark room, suspend your disbelief, and not be frightened.  I won't claim this is a perfect film.  In fact, it seems as if either the creative forces behind the movie lost their edge at times or some Hollywood producers got their hands on it at some point.  As a whole, however, 28 Days Later delivers the goods.Once you can accept a disease consisting of pure rage is infecting humanity turning everyone into zombies, you're good to go.  The most compelling part about the film is its characters.  They are actually more than pieces of meat waiting for the next act of utter stupidity to lead them to slaughter. Their humanity in the face of oblivion is absolutely believable.  This is not to say that they don't do things that put them in danger of getting shredded by zombies.  But, more often than not, zombie encounters are an organic part of the plot, not contrivances to eliminate a character who has hit his or her expiration date.Once the few central survivors have bonded over narrow escapes and nights spent huddled in fear, the movie switches gears and leads them to an encampment of soldiers with the weaponry and defenses necessary to fend off the zombies.  At this point the film takes a totally different, but fascinating take on human nature as it pertains to impending zombie takeover.  Of course, it wouldn't be any fun if the zombies didn't breach the sanctity of the makeshift army base.  The film unfortunately ends in a way you'll have to see to disbelieve, though the DVD has deleted endings that you can easily replace the real one with in your mind.[end spoilers]The important part here is that you'll be scared.  I've had nightmares about this movie, so be forewarned if you're impressionable.  I'm not normally entertained by horror movies.

667,basula07,"Powerful, horrific, emphatic....all at the same time",8,23 January 2006,"This is a film that is macabre yet aching, violent yet emphatic. Take a would-be mediocre apocalyptic zombie flick, add some philosophy into it coupled with a haunting setting and atmosphere, and you have a great zombie flick that reminisces the 1940s' Dawn of the Dead.A team of human rights activists breaks into a lab and attempts to free a bunch of infected monkeys. The scientists warn that the monkeys are infected with 'Rage', a newly discovered virus which spreads by blood. Those who are infected with 'Rage' will develop a thirst to kill in 10 seconds, and once they have, they cannot be stopped without having to be killed. Unfortunately, the scientists' warnings fall on deaf ears and the monkeys are freed...and to put it to words, all hell breaks loose.28 days later, a guy named Jim (Murphy) wakes up in a hospital to find that the whole of London is desolate. He learns that the 'Rage' virus had spread throughout London and caused everyone to kill each other. So everyone is either dead or evacuated. He manages to catch up with some survivors and joins them in their fight to survive. Much to his dismay, he learns that now he cannot afford to trust anyone and in order to survive, friends, family and even allies have to be killed. The intensity of the situation and the will to survive has brought the worst out in everyone, and those who should really be their true allies might turn to be their real enemies (you will learn about this at the end of the movie).The factor that stands 28 Days Later out from most zombie flicks is the incorporation of a more visceral twist to the story; this movie asks questions that challenge the darker sides of human nature -- in a desperate situation such as this, will you let your emotions kick in? Have the survivors themselves become killing machines in their own right? Have we become like the 'infected' themselves -- slaying families, friends and allies with no mercy, all just in an attempt to make it out of a seemingly hopeless situation? The only law that applies to such a situation would be 'survival of the fittest', that is, the strong will survive and the weak will not. But is surviving really worth it, after shedding so much blood from those you used to know, love, care about? Are we, after all, the real killers? For the second part of this movie (which a lot of people deem as unnecessary and incredulous) I have to agree wholeheartedly with the reviewers who say that it is an important part of the story. Could the people who are supposed to be our true allies (the British soldiers) be after all, our true enemies? The answer might be a little bit psychological; it seems that they have been so emotionally shaken and traumatised by such a catastrophe that they become no longer humane. And in the end, is it better to live in such inhumane and horrific conditions, perhaps for the rest of their lives, or to die? Powerful, horrific, emphatic, compelling...all at the same time, 28 Days Later is a horror film like no other. A true masterpiece.",28 Days Later...
668,carlphillips1,Was a surprisingly excellent film.,8,19 April 2005,"When I first saw the previews for 28 Days Later, I figured it was simply another middling zombie movie: crowd-pleasing, but shallow. After its release onto DVD and video, however, I saw that it was given very good reviews, and I decided to rent it. I was amazed.Besides being chilling and exciting film, many parts of it had a genuine atmosphere. The visual effects, including the key color- red-, give the story a dream-like authenticity. Sometime while watching it, it hits you that the plot is actually fictional. Though it is easy to realize that many of the most eloquent scenes are set up in previous ones, if you think about it for a while, you'll only remember the stunning imagery, interesting camera angles, and the simple but spine-tingling music.The acting in 28 Days Later was also quite satisfying. Cillian Murphy gave a good performance as Jim, who's mysterious and strategical sides are revealed when he is on the run in a temporary military post in upper England. Naomie Harris also performed very well as Selena, a kind and motherly young woman, who's main concern is protecting Hannah from the raging zombies as well as from the military soldiers who, dazed by isolation, are trying unnecessarily to procreate.I believe one of the most chilling moments is when Jim (Murphy) looks up into the sky and sees a plane flying across. This was when I first truly realized that the only place affected by the dangerous virus was Great Britain. Everyone else in the world was still going about their usual business, and might not have even known of the epidemic.

It blatantly steels from THE OMEGA MAN staring Charlton Heston, and then there was THE LAST MAN ON EARTH with Vincent Price. Not to mention the George A. Romero zombie films. A good film it is but it's not original. Either way Danny Boyle did do a good job with his epidemic film. The acting was fantastic and they didn't shy off on the blood to much...

675,hpeterji,A great scary film!!!,9,30 June 2003,"At last, I waited enough and ran over to the nearest theater by my apartment to check it out as soon as it got released. All the pieces of information that I read on the papers and the Internet gave me an enough insights of the film '28 Days Later...' I just wanted to see it myself so that I could say it was more than what I was waiting for.Danny Boyle. To me he is one of only two contemporary directors whom I adore from the U.K., and the other one is Guy Ritchie. I don't know what Guy Ritchie will do in order to make up for what he did with the last miserable failure film ever???!!! However, Danny Boyle didn't disappoint me with 'the Beach' last time not as bad as most of critics and fans would think. So, as soon as I saw the trailer of 28 Days Later, I got hooked into it right away and knew something would be different this time.So there was I. I was sitting among those who wanted to catch the Boyle's new film on the last Sunday of June. On top of hearing all the great backdrops, like it was a biggest sleeper hit in the U.K. last year since it was opened in November and such, the sort of different genre that Boyle was interested in was enough of a catch for his fans, including myself.The film begins with a scene where some monkeys are locked up in a small glass tanks and tied up on the operation beds, being forced to watch repeated montage sequences of very disturbing and violent scenes, such as riots, fights, war, and etc., on several monitors. And then activists break in to free them but what they didn't know was how bad these monkeys' conditions are, with something called 'rage.' In spite of a lab scientist trying to prevent the monkeys from being freed by these activists, one of the activists unlocks one of the glass tanks. Then it all begins. (I think that is enough of a start...)What I like about Boyle's films is that he always works on characters more than stories. To me, how he develops each story is that he gives his characters a choice to make and then lets it unfold on its own. Maybe the genre was different but his way of telling a story was the same, like his other films, such as Trainspotting and Life Less Ordinary and even The Beach.One thing that I liked the most in this film was the twist.Jim, our main character, and other survivors (Frank, middle-aged former taxi driver and Hannah, his daughter, and Selena, who saved Jim at the first place and became his love interest) were running away to survive from these creatures (something rather than human after being infected with this rage) who would attack and eat them up alive or have them infected and make 'em become one of them to the place where they think they will be protected by the army.Eventually when they got there, it was the beginning of the next trouble they were about to face. These soldiers wanted to have sex with the two girls by force in order to protect them, and Jim was not happy with the idea and was thrown away to a remote area to get killed. But, he managed to escape and came back with vengeance. Now he became the chaser, not the runner. He was the one who wanted to kill these soldiers to save the two girls. As a strategy to make them confused, Jim freed the strained soldier who got infected but didn't get killed earlier...The film was shot on video and looked pretty awesome to me. Although there were some scenes that I was thinking would've been greater if they were shot on film. As you know, with not enough of lighting (and even with enough lighting), shooting on video loses lots of details and crispness. However, I appreciated how it was shot and how each shot was composed as far as cinematography.It was an absolutely ming-boggling experience. I wasn't overall scared too much of the film but there was one scene where Jim decided to go into a burger restaurant while other survivors was getting gas from an abandoned gas tank truck. I asked myself why he was going in there? It was dark in there, which means these infected creatures must be in there... and so on. For a very brief moment, but I was scared. And I believe that is how Danny Boyle explores his characters.Get scared!!!",28 Days Later...
676,david77,A fearful vision follows a weak premise,7,7 July 2003,"With the weak premise of a virus that produces murderous rage in seconds behind, the movie ""28 Days Later"" proceeds to sufficiently apall and frighten its viewers. The premise-monkeys with a rage-producing virus in their blood, are turned loose by some misdirected animal lovers who are immediately attacked and bitten by the monkeys. Those who survive become within seconds ""the infecteds"" who will search for someone to kill-or failing to kill-will create another infected human.We meet our hero, Cillian Murphy, as he awakens from an accident that had kept him-a bicycle courier-in a coma for 28 days. He finds himself in an apparently deserted London. The views of him alone in the city's vastness-surrounded by upended vehicles, garbage, and complete disorganization-are eerily threatening and photographed quite well.
He soon finds plenty of dead people in a church and after saying ""Hello"" hesitantly is assaulted by a murderous priest, and some others. He is rescued by two uninfected humans who blow up the pursuers. The female rescuer, Naomi Harris, explains the situation to Murphy while not releasing her hold on a machete. This comes in handy shortly thereafter, when she must kill her partner after he is bitten by an infected human.
Apparently the virus has spread all over Britain. There is no TV or radio, nor any government. Survival is paramount, and director Danny Boyle keeps the action moving briskly.Shot in digital video, the film looks like nothing you've seen before-a greater sense of the immediate, perhaps. Murphy soon becomes a survivor like Harris, and with some others, they make their way to a possible military facility they've learned about on a recorded radio broadcast. It soon becomes a question of whether they have made a sensible move.
While we know that viruses take time to make people sick, the times we live in now and the threat of bioterror make this film all the more watchable and interesting.",28 Days Later...
677,seger_now,"Personally, the most horrifying movie I've ever seen.",10,21 October 2003,"*28 Days Later* was the most horrifying movie I've ever seen. No, I'm not exaggerating. No, I'm not being too easy on it. I am being honest--the simple fact is, no other movie has ever terrified me quite like this one. This film isn't jump-out-of-your-seat scary (although there are a couple of surprise ""Boo!"" parts), rather it is burrowing-under-you-skin frightening.I thought the acting was perfect, the writing smart, the story horrifying (and somewhat plausible, despite the unlikely nature that a virus would change someone that fast) and the direction raw and crisp.
I often complain about the crappy world we live in, but when seeing a world as depicted through this movie, it renews your gratefulness of the status quo. Things could be a lot worse.Kudos to Danny, Alex, and company for a job well done!",28 Days Later...

But seriously folks, this movie does go above and beyond the boundaries of the average ""zombie"" flick. If its gore you want, this movie has plenty. But what this movie has that most don't, is an involving, intense, and overall CONVINCING storyline. These are characters that you come to care about. And these zombies are not the ones you have come to expect. In fact I don't even think they have a hunger for flesh, but they do have an all out URGE to kill anything that is still breathing. This means they can run after their victims instead of lumbering slowly and ineffectively. (The downside of the average zombie is shown in the color remake of Night OF The Living Dead, when the not so hot heroine simply shoves all the zombies aside!) Plus you see that hot hunk of a man, NUDE! Lets cross our fingers and hope for a GREAT DVD in the future. Sincerely, Dave the dudeP.S.

681,laxcat,Finest zombies one could ever hope for!,8,28 July 2003,"I love scary movies, but don't see them very often because of the high importance I place on production quality. Most scary movies are contrived, full of stereotypes and are poorly made.It's refreshing to see one that breaks the mold.While 28 Days Later contains a good portion of the stereotypes almost necessary for any chiller, (a main character stupidly venturing off alone into that dark building (attic, basement, alley-way) where he's sure to find nothing but trouble) we are fortunately free (for the most part) of the more painful clichés.28 Days' high points are its intriguing story, creative directing, and above all, the coolest, most scary zombies ever to be seen. The characters are relatively well developed, the plot features several twists and turns to keep it interesting, and. did I mention the zombies?Top rate spookfest for fans of the macabre and normals alike.[By the way, if you are planning on seeing this movie again for the alternate ending, it was highly disappointing and not even edited into the end of the film. It's just tacked onto the end of the credits. The original ending, while disappointingly up-beat for some, was also much better and more natural. Go see it again because it's a good movie but not for the new ending. Wait for the DVD for that.]",28 Days Later...
682,integralesixteenvalve,"Brilliant, but NOT a Zombie movie",10,6 January 2008,"Let's get one thing straight first of all. Many reviewers have referred to 'zombies' in this film. It's an easy mistake to make but does colour one's opinion before they have even seen this genuinely frightening tale. Zombies are dead people bought back to life. The 'monsters' in 28 Days Later are still very much alive but infected with the 'Rage Virus', a strange man-made virus that looks like a nasty mixture of rabies and ebola (especially in the way it's passed on).28 Days Later ranks as one of the most disturbing and genuinely unsettling films I have ever seen, a horror story in the true sense of the word. Other's have drawn parallels with Biohazard, the Romero 'zombie' series and Resident Evil. However, if this film has any real debt for it's inspiration, it must lie with the equally disturbing BBC sci-fi/environmental horror serials of the 1970's: Survivors, The Mad Death, and The Day Of The Triffids. The scene where Jim wakes up in hospital and then walks out into a depopulated and devastated London owes so much to John Duttine's similar journey in Douglas Livingston's superb adaptation of Triffids.What made this such an unsettling tale was it's relative believability compared with most horror tales. One can imagine the 'Rage Virus' doing it's worst in real life and anyone who can remember how fast the panic over last Summer's Foot and Mouth outbreak spread can identify with much of this story. Viruses, from Ebola to HIV to Rabies and others are genuinely frightening because the spread so fast and infect at will without us puny humans being able to do much to prevent it. While 'Rage' is purely fictional and the premise of man against nature is an old plot, Alex Garland and Danny Boyle have brought more than a few new wrinkles to the table. Together with Matthew Tildsley's superb production design and excellent performances from the cast, 28 Days Later is an effective and chilling film that MUST be seen. Once seen, it won't be forgotten easily. Especially if you watch back to back with the equally impressive (although slightly sillier) sequel 28 Weeks Later.",28 Days Later...
683,bobbyallright,great idea but then it bombs,5,10 December 2007,"I give it half points because the movie started out great and then nose dived during the second half. All the excitement over this movie shows that people really bought into the idea of a virus killing most of the population and there being only a few survivors running and fighting against it. The idea is really good. Even the beginning where they explain how the virus stared with scientific experiments with chips. Then the introduction of our character awaking in a hospital very uncertain as to where all the people have gone and what has happened to them. Then meeting up with other survivors and coming across the army transmission and the their new mission to find the military camp of supposed safety. All of this was great. But then when they finally got to the soldiers camp the movie just lost it. It's as if the writers didn't know what to do next so they threw up their hands and drove the movie right into the ground. Sort of like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" where you have a story line going and then in the 2nd half of the movie you bring in the cheap idiot script to finish the movie because you haven't thought that far ahead. In both movies you have this journey to a specific place, and then once that place is reached you can't just end the movie because you need to fill in one more hour of filming. So slash everyone to pieces with senseless gore. In 28 Days the supposedly safe military guys turn evil and want to rape the women and there are then fights within the camp and along with the infected that eventually get access to the inside. Completely and unbelievably stupid. The sequel 28 Weeks Later did a better job of not destroying the 2nd half and for that I commend them. But I must bash the sequel for its stupid and unbelievable characters. The first movie did a better job with developing the characters and making them believable (the first half of the movie that is). So finally I can say that the movie has a great idea , but they just did a terrible job with it in both movies for different reasons.",28 Days Later...
684,blamire,Filmed In the Wonder of Confuse-o-vision!,3,15 July 2003,"Starts off promising and quite fascinating, slides a bit when characters do those illogical things they do in inferior horror movies, then goes completely silly in the third act when the movie finds itself stuck in a castle with an absurd climax.  Apparently there were two DPs: one quite competent, even inspired.  Then when the action scenes happen, a completely different cinematographer seems to take over.  Scenes that should/could be terrifying are sunk by being shot in Confuse-o-vision, a process closely related to Incomprehensoscope.  As a result, we hear loud bad noises, see flashes of movement of some sort, and basically HAVE NO IDEA AT ALL WHAT IS HAPPENING.  The infected ones seem to have been given some very intriguing--and consistent--choreography.  So why compound and confuse all their hard work with an equally spastic camera?  Makes no sense.  SHALLOW GRAVE had such strong simple storytelling--such clear communication to its audience.  I am much more affected/involved when a film lets me in on what's happening (call me crazy).  Too bad this silly-cam stuff is so trendy. Hopefully, it will pass.  What a letdown.",28 Days Later...

For me, the themes and points of view that this movie shows are the heart of the movie...from the aspect of survival in extreme situations to the thin frontier that separates violence from non-violence, from the simple human emotions to the more complex ones, among others. And the details? Oh, yes, full of them...and i think that is a very positive thing in any movie, whichever movie genre.

690,mbauer728,Huge Disappointment,3,3 August 2003,"I saw this film at a film festival about 5 months or so ago, but since it's just now received a wide US release, I figured I'd post my thoughts. First off, I'd like to put out there I love horror films probably more than any other genre of film, and I really enjoyed Trainspotting and The Beach. Soooo...lets put those 2 elements together, and something great should come out, right?Not exactly....This movie is pretty awful. It starts off amazingly enough. The first 45 minutes are great. I was really drawn in, and was expecting to come out of this film with a good experience. But things began to go downhill, and quick.The first 45 mins are a solid horror outing. There are some great scares, and an excellent atmosphere. Then we move into the second phase of the film, which is a road trip across the UK. Any horror or suspense, or just about anything really entertaining is lost here. But whatever, the movie hit a bump, and the climax should be better.Not so. This is the worst part of the film. Here we turn a zombie horror flick into a military operation. At this point, the zombie's become null. The whole point of the film is lost. Instead of the zombie's being the problem, it's now the soldiers, and this is where the climax happens. We are no longer at all focused on the problem that started the film. It's almost like 2 different films smooshed together.So in the end, the only thing worthwhile about this movie is the first 45 minutes. But with everything that goes on for the next 70 mins, those 45 mins don't matter at all. Pass on this one.Final Verdict: 3 out of 10",28 Days Later...
691,headlessannie,An intellectual horror movie?,10,10 September 2003,"When I went to see this film, I expected a pretty standard horror movie. Although I thought the characters would be a bit more interesting than usual, I figured that in the end it would still be a long string of darkness, rain, ambient howls, and people crouching in crevices unaware that the evil is behind them rather than in front of them.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the filmmakers had something better in mind.  This a superb film.  It is both visually and auditorily stimulating.  The dialogue is well written and well delivered, which makes it easy to empathized with the characters.  The story is excellent, which is rare in a horror film. The camera perspective alternates between first and third person throughout the film to heighten tension, which is far more interesting than the standard practice of just turning up the eerie music for a cheap scare.  The music in this film is not used to manipulate the audience.  It is beautiful and haunting, and it gives fullness to the scenes where it is present. Plus, the ending was hopeful rather than hokey.  All of these elements came together perfectly on this film, and it gives the film a more human quality. It isn't overblown at all.  It relies on substance rather than special effects to get its point across.  I was overwhelmed by how beautifully it was rendered.",28 Days Later...

I was actually hoping it would surprise me at the end and start to make sense and draw me into it a little bit....NOPE. The entire movie was just horrible.

The second half was a bit of a let down though, soldiers breaking down kept together with the promise of sex. I just didn't buy it, there seemed to be holes in the plot that just didnt allow for it.

695,keius,Extremely disappointing after the hype (some small spoilers),3,26 October 2004,"I can suspend my disbelief about certain scientific facts that were totally ignored.

Makes people homicidal but only homicidal enough to bite others so they can turn...maybe if the zombies tried to eat and kill each other and everything, i could accept it as the ""Rage"".(But hey it's another spin on the zombie movie :P )Why is it disappointing you ask me? Simply because the actions of the characters were supremely ludicrous and pretty much made no friggin sense.The animal activists...not even they are stupid enough to do what they did when they were told that the animals were infected, and the evidence being right in front of them.The total change of character from tough cookie to helpless creampuff for the black girl. Jim the ex-comatose patient morphing into Rambo.Why would Jim bayonet the soldier cook and then leave his nice full auto rifle on the floor so he could run around as unarmed zombie bait? How many times have you seen a character disable the monster/enemy and then run alway leaving their weapons so the monster/enemy can get back up, pick the weapon up and then chase them again. The pathetic helplessness of the soldiers who supposedly survived as long as they did. They seemed tough at first then in the end started cowering...dropping weapons...etc. Too out of character.The fact that none of them attempted to get off the island. Remember what the Sargeant said in captivity? Soldiers do have some common sense in the real world. At least in Romero's zombie flicks, they tried to get off into the sea to look for some measure of hope.28 days later...how can those apples be fresh and pristine?

699,audiosabbath_29720,"These are actually zombies, but just a little twisted",6,5 April 2004,"SPOILERS SO BE PREPAREDFirst things first, these are zombies.  I know some of u are thinkin ""no, a zombie is a reanimated corpse."" well lets be honest people, these ""infected"" are as good as dead they have no resemblence of life more than zombies. They cant really do anything except run, kill, and sleep. They cant do math, read, have a conversation, understand that a bed is a place where u sleep; no they just kill and if u think about it they do go thru a process much like the process of becoming reanimated. The infected in this movie could be killed easily if hit in vital parts, but the infected were not responsive to pain and would not die or stop running if hit in parts of the body that arent critical to survival, much like a zombie not being able to be killed unless shot in the head. Is nobody catchin on yet.  The people who become infected are talking up to the point that they become an infected just like a person who becomes a zombie and can talk until he/she becomes a zombie. So these are zombies. In case u wanted to say that the people are crazies well thats somewhat impossible bc a person cannot be sane one minute and be given a virus that makes them beyond crazy and still be considered human bc that is basically zombification in a more indirect way. BUT ENOUGH OF THE ZOMBIES IN 28 DAYS LATER. Down to bidness. OK yes this movie does owe some to the original dawn of the dead and to day of the dead but thats ok. This is the positive section. OK a virus is released in england, but we dont get to witness all the devastation bc this movie is 28 days later and it just shows the aftermath. A creepy and somewhat effective notion. Jim wakes up from a coma and finds an empty london except for a lot of trash. Now some people say there should be more devastation and destruction and blood but Boyle was goin more for a spine-tingling effect and an odd effect which is understandable maybe not likable, but it depends on who you are. I was actually p***ed when selena killed mark and thats good bc it was a moment where i actually had an emotion instead of being like ok and so what. Brendan Gleeson had a great role and his death was also nerve-racking. The thing this movie did best was use references from dawn and day of the dead. This movie did not just basically have sceens that were almost direct rip-offs from those 2 movies but instead had sceens that were very similar but different enough not to deter anybody from the movie. The infection was also a good idea bc this gave these zombies a more original feel than what had been used over and over and over again in the past.Now for the bad. This could take a while OK this movie had its moments of bad, neutral, and wouldnt be a bad thing if it made sense to what was goin on. The greatest example of wouldnt be a bad thing if it made sense to what was goin on is the soldiers who feel the need to procreate so that a new civilization can begin. This would not be a bad idea if ALL OF THE WORLD WAS OVERRUN WITH INFECTED but only england is infected so the soldiers need to procreate is a little bit pointless and does yet again bring about an example of an old cliche which will remain nameless. Now to the virus and how far it spread. Most of the movie gives the impression and even mentions that the virus has spread across the world, but we later find out that it is only in england and the rest of the world is keeping england in quarantine which really takes the fear of a ""rage"" virus down a few notches. This type of virus althought ludacris in thought would have the potential to bring down society over here in the western hemisphere but if its just in england the fact that it spreads in only 20-30 seconds would keep it in england so no need for us here in America to fear a ""rage"" virus comin from england. The movie is a little bit uneventful, but it is 28 days later so not a lot is goin on at that time. Its now time for my take on Jim transforming from superbitch bycycle courier to special operatives killing machine. I dont know how this is possible in the span of 2 days with no special training but he does manage it by god, and although incredibly stupid does give some action to the movie which was necessary bc this movie had to end. The end although not a terrible sceen is a bad sceen bc it puts the final nail in the couffin for any fear of this virus bc it shows humans in control for the most part and the zombies in a decaying state so that ruins the whole terror the the virus. This movie although not horrible, wasnt great either and ends up defeating itself throughout the movie.",28 Days Later...

While the film is engaging on the first watch it is not an instant classic.*Minor Spoiler*The cinematography in the opening scene, as Jim walks through a deserted London and the music escalates from nothing to an almost deafening roar the effect is really quite impressive, watching Jim walk through a deserted city and slowly coming to realise that the world he knew has gone is amazing.Finally, as with all good zombie movies, this film is more about the people and how they deal with the situation rather than actually being about zombies",28 Days Later...
701,Marblebees,Thrilling and engaging all the way through!,9,13 December 2013,"I had heard a lot of 28 days later before i saw it. I had seen some scenes from it and heard the music. Overall i was expecting a 7/10 movie, great movie - but not a to memorable one. But i was BLOWN AWAY. Some of the scenes in this movie had me rolling around on the couch in stress. The way this movie presents everything makes it atmospheric and extremely intense.So pros and consPROS: - as i said - THRILLING AND ENGAGING ALL THE WAY THROUGH. And that is one of this movies biggest pros. The atmosphere of seeing central London totally abandoned gave me goose bumps. The action packed scenes are simple yet intense and effective. The low budget forced the creators to use cinematography and sound at its best - and they succeeded.Feels real. This movie seems so real in the way its made. The small details everywhere are amazing.Fitting music. This movie has a soundtrack that i sometimes just sit down and listen to, because its just so good. It has slow builds and when it all drops you have pure awesomeness.Cinematography. The camera angles and tricks in this movie make are some of the things that makes it special. Simple and effective at making you feel afraid and full of adrenaline.Sets are awesome and give you goose bumps. Some of these sets gave me goosebumps (especially abandoned London) they are just so well thought out.Its simple. No over the top CGI, no cheap jump scares - this movie is better than that, its simple. And that makes it great. Simple camera angles. Simple scenes. With PERFECT execution. That is what makes it intenseCONS:A few things that seem like they wouldn't happen... but thats about itAll in all this movie is a masterpiece - near perfect zombie horror that returns to the former glory of horror films9/10",28 Days Later...

703,rue_alain,"Very Good, Not A Zombie Film",8,26 January 2014,"This is a good movie but it is not a ""zombie movie"" which is how my friends described it to me, I guess knowing that I am a zombie horror movie genre nut. The movie starts when environmental terrorists break into a lab that contains diseased monkeys who have been exposed to a so called ""rage virus"". When they break the monkeys out the monkeys attack them and when one of them escapes the virus is on the loose and it's only a matter of time before it engulfs England and then the rest of the world presumably. Cillian Murphy is great as the film's hero who wakes up in a hospital (seeing this made me realize either it copied the Walking Dead comics (haven't read it so don't know for sure) or Walking Dead the TV show took the idea from 28 Days Later. It's great though and the director does a fantastic job building tension.I don't want to give away too much but it's a very engrossing movie and I think fans of any kind of ""scary"" or psychological movie will enjoy it a lot. The ending also is very awesome and you're not sure what will happen or what choice the woman will make until she does it.... won't say more than that because I don't want to spoil it but you'll know what I mean at the end.

706,jadendwood,Sub-great,5,30 June 2017,"This is my first review, so bear with me. I overall liked the movie, but I felt ultimately displeased by the end, especially after reading some of the other reviews. (I created an IMDb account just so I could write this review!) I don't think it's as genius as many think. Sure, fast-moving infected--a type of neo-zombie--is a cool idea, but I just didn't find it very scary. I keep thinking of Day of the Dead, because in it the soldiers all turn crazy, too. It's like Selena and Jim swap characters in the end. At first, Jim's kinda wimpy but at the end he suddenly turns into a stealth ninja. And Selena is all tough at the beginning but then turns into a helpless damsel in distress for no reason. Seems like there's a lot of incontinuity in this film. I could keep nitpicking, but others already have, and besides, I liked the ""normality"" line a lot. That was thought-provoking (""humans killing humans is the normality"").It's not about the infected so much as human nature in times of crisis. Instead of working together, they fight to the death. I like these ideas, I just didn't like how it was done. The whole premise of 28 days later is a plot hole, skipping 28 days. And then they do it again at the end! Seems like a very convenient and easy plot device to me. Jim is much more likely to die or get killed in that hospital then wake up and wander. I mean, if the infected have been out for 28 days, you'd think they'd be hungry and lookin' for some meat and find the skinny naked dude. Guess not.A good movie, I give it an even split right-down-the-middle. Just not my ""cup of tea,"" I s'pose.",28 Days Later...

Oops.The director's view of this film is very annoying. It's like ""lets have fun with the camera and see how many weird places we can film from, how much we can dolly the camera in every shot, tilt the camera to weird angles, and generally be pretentiously artsy and obtuse.""The horror aspect is amateurish. The last thing I expected was a zombie film, which is basically what this movie is all about. Silly zombies who are *inexplicably* not dead like nearly all the rest of British humanity, and how possess superhuman speed and agility, hiss a lot, and cough up volumes of blood. Ooohhh ... don't get hit by any blood or you'll be a zombie in ... 15 to 20 seconds ... Ooooohhhh ....This movie just didn't know what it wanted to be when it grew up. I expected something along the lines of 12 Monkeys, and got a bizarre zombie flick instead.I hold Roger Ebert and James Berardinelli responsible for tricking me with their 3/4 reviews. I should send each of them a bill for half of my $7.50. On their scale I'd give it a 1.5/4, or maybe a 2/4 if I was in a good mood. On my traditional 10 scale, a la IMDb, I give it a 4.

A story by acclaimed novelist Alex Garland, set in a postapocalyptic (disease) Britain, good cast and a successful director.However, though the result is by no means a poor movie, 28 Days Later has a script that is way too flawed to not be irritated by. Watching this with a friend, we were continuously remarking ""Why on earth are they doing that"" and ""why don't they just do something obvious. It also made me wonder why the writer nor director nor even actors had noticed the same things. Or if they had, why they chose not to make any changes. Also, the whole soldier-would-be-rapists crew thing is just not believable. This movie had the potential to say something about human reaction and conduct in such a situation, but wasted it with that whole plot twist.In the end, if you like postapocalyptic stories, and can look the other way on all the annoyingly stupid moves by many of the characters and generally implausible turn of events, you should find this movie entertaining.",28 Days Later...
710,madmarek,The movie that Resident Evil wants to be....,9,4 November 2002,"Remember when a horror movie meant you had to be 18 or over to watch it? Remember what it was like to sit in the dark and be genuinely disturbed about what you were watching? I'm not on about the ghastly images of a 13 times resurrected man wearing a William Shatner mask on the prowl yet again, or the cliché filled one liners from a fire ravaged man with appalling tastes in woolly jumpers.No, try to think past that. Try to remember the days when a horror didn't mean a killer on the prowl in a school full of perfectly formed teenagers, who all look like clones of ever other perfectly formed teenagers from a score of movies and TV shows. Try to remember when you were fighting with your girlfriend over who was going to hide behind whom. She always won of course and while she hid behind you, you had to lift up your arm to block the image for a second, because you knew something terrible was going to happen and part of you wanted to watch, but the sane part of you, the part that gets scared and truly believes in vampires, ghosts and monsters when you are on your own in bed at 2:30 in the morning and you've just heard a noise downstairs; that part of you couldn't watch. The funny thing is, when you gave up and lowered your arm, the demon would choose that moment to pounce and you'd jump out of your seat, almost knocking your girlfriend unconscious.Remember movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist and Dawn of the Dead, Movies that were entertaining, but with gritty, disturbing realistic concepts? They had, 'What if' scenarios that were fantasy based on reality and were filmed in such a way that you believed it could happen, or at least you could imagine it happening and picture yourself trying to run around a supermarket trying to survive against hordes of zombies; something which I've always wanted to do actually.Welcome to 28 Days later, a movie that takes horror back to its roots, whilst maintaining a modern edge that doesn't bow down to the Hollywood mainstream.Jim wakes up in a hospital 28 days after a deadly virus is let loose on the unsuspecting, and I can imagine quite upset, British public. Society, as Jim knows it has collapsed (`It's worse then that Jim, everyone's dead!') but Jim is so shocked, he has to wander around a deserted London and bump into the reason for societies untimely demise before he finally gets it. The reason being infected humans. Now the infected are not like your classic zombie. They don't wander around like drugged up disabled people moaning, 'Brains.' You can't easily doge a hundred of them, nor can you quickly push triangle, circle R2, R2 on your Playstation to skip a level. These are humans whose blood boils with rage, they are totally consumed with a berserker fury, therefore they are just as quick and as strong as normal humans, but maybe a little more as their rage seems to fuel them. Plus they don't give a s*** about their own safety; they will gladly slice their own arm off if it meant they could get to you. Their aim simply seems to be to kill or infect other humans; that's it! So, the movie is basically about Jim and some people he meets up with trying to survive in a world gone mad, while at the same time it sends a message that humans do not need a rage virus to become inhuman.The Director, Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) successfully draws the audience in to Jim, and humanities plight. The movie is low budget, but Danny uses all the tricks he can to add to the atmosphere, things like striking, powerful images of deserted cities and motorways, believable characters and some of the most realistic looking dead bodies I've ever seen in a movie. Even the use of digital cameras adds to the gritty realism.Although not a very original concept, 28 Days Later is far better then any recent similar movies like Resident Evil, although it does borrow quite heavily from Dawn of the Dead, which if you think about it isn't really a bad thing!",28 Days Later...

713,Iesius,This Movie Stinks,1,23 January 2004,"The premise behind this film fails to keep my interests because what goes on after the initial virus hit is so unrealistic that it cannot induce fear in me.  A virus turns ordinary people into rage-filled zombies killing most of England's population.  Fair enough.  The power there goes out and contact with the outside world is lost.  The characters assume the worst, they think the rest of the world has suffered the same fate as England, and don't even try to get off the island.  Unfortunately for the story writer no one ever told him about things like that radios still pick up signals from France or that a smart character, you know, the kind you care about, might try to use a boat to get off the island.  What about the Chunnel? Heck some people can swim across the English Channel.  Instead the characters listen to their radio which tells them to come to the British Army...and what a great army it is, because after only one month they have degenerated into a bunch of power-driven thieving rapists -- doesn't Brittan have one of the top 5 armies in the world!??! Yet in the film they can't keep discipline for 4 weeks...unbelievable.  Pepsi is everywhere, annoying!  And odd seeing as the stuff is hard to find in England.  So poorly written, and as for the tagline on the commercials ""scariest movie since the exorcist.""  Wow, they want the viewer to think taking a digital cam quarter and zooming in and out again really fast is scary?  Or that people making some of the dumbest decisions ever, and paying for them with their lives is scary? Now I know why I haven't been scared of a movie since I was a kid.

715,www-jona-jp,"Lesson one: You never go anywhere alone, unless you've got no choice. Lesson two: Only travel during daylight, unless you've got no choice",10,16 April 2008,"The film is shot with hand-held DV-cameras (Digital Video) to make it looks like some kind of documentary film; for me, it just make it even more scarier. And kinda you can say it is a documentary, as director Boyle says, he in a way ""warn"" us. In ""Pure Rage: The Making of 28 Days Later"" scientist studied a Ebola, which the Rage Virus in the film is based on, and says that it is not impossible for virus to do as much damage as in the movie! My and my family rent the film back in 2003 when it came out. Actually I wouldn't see it at this time, but my sister's friend said that it was awesome, so she absolutely WANTED to see it too I saw it that evening Oh my God!When Jim walked out the hospital and out on the empty streets with Godspeed You Black Empore's ""East Hasting"" playing in the background, my first thought was: How did they do that?! I mean, how did they shut down the streets in London? Amazing scene, one of the best made, actually. The first big chase-scene starts about 10 minutes into the film, were Jim enters the church. That scene scared me a lot first time I saw it. The chase-scene ends with a huge, cool gas-station explosion, that cost the crew £250,000 in total. The film has many other chase-scenes, like in the tower block, just before Jim and Selena meet Frank and Hannah, I think that it is a cool scene; good edited by Chris Gill. I think Danny Boyle has created a new type of film making: He uses abnormal camera-angels that I never ever have seen in a film before, he accentuate the colors and then he makes a fantastic atmosphere The film ends with a impressive climax-scene, which I mean is the best climax-scene, I've ever seen. I don't just recommend this film for horror-fans but for every movie-lover, because for me, it's more than just a horror There's action, thrilling, scenes that makes you jump, there is love, it's sad 6/6 stars!",28 Days Later...
716,ddart1,Excellent British movie,9,2 January 2008,This movie is amazing. i've seen people on IMDb complaining about apparent flaws in 28 days later such as why is London so clean and why are there hardly any zombies for a population of 7 million. Well for a start after a bout 3-5 weeks you die of starvation which explains why after 28 days there aernt many zombies. The reason why the streets are quite bare is because most people evacuated to the airport where all the carnage happened im guessing. And amybe no one bothered going into the budgens shop as they were too concerned with getting to the airport which is why its not trashed. I love this movie and think there's an answer to most of the stuff that happens in this movie.,28 Days Later...
717,Moviegeek93,Not just a zombie flick...,9,20 February 2010,"28 days later is a sci-fi horror film directed by Danny Boyle and produced by Andrew MacDonald. I did not see it when it came out because i was not that much into horror at that time. I saw it for the first time a few years ago and watched it again just before writing this review.This is one of my top 100 favorite movies of all time for sure. Although the actors are not that known they do an excellent job. The action is tense and will keep you at the edge of your seat. The plot is well structured and has no gaps or what so ever.What makes this film so unique is that it introduces us a new ""zombie race"". These ""infected people"" don't resemble at all the classical Romero style of zombies. The infected people can run very fast and be killed more easily. They also need to remain in a dark place since they cannot stand sunlight.This movie is also one of the only horror movies that try to send a message to the audience. In this case we are warned that infections and viruses are not taken too seriously and that they can develop into something similar to what's shown in the film: spreading fast and killing people.Overall, one of the best 21th century horror films. I recommend this film to zombie fans since it has got loads of them and also horror fans that are looking for a modern classic.9/10",28 Days Later...
718,tannacker,"Finally, someone put out a great horror flick.",10,13 July 2003,"I realize that 28 days later was released in 2002 overseas, but I finally caught it today; July 12, 2003 in lower Manhattan. I read many reviews from others that saw the movie, some praised it and others criticized it. As always I prefer to see movies for myself before commenting on them. 28 days later is by far one of the most superb horror flicks I have ever seen. It opened to little fan fair here in the US, but it seems to be picking up steam. And there is a good reason for that the movie is awesome. I caught it at my favorite theater: United Artists Battery Park Stadium 16, located at 102 North End Avenue, New York NY 10281, across the street from where the WTC once stood. The entire audience seemed scared out of their wits, but no one dared to leave and miss out on the rest of the movie. I myself was freaked out during certain scenes and I love the movie and its director for those reasons. The film is very continuous in its attempt to give off the feeling of dread and horror. Hollywood should take notice of this film and its director. 28 days later was shot on an 8 million dollar budget and has to date raked in $28,505,000 in the US alone. This goes to show you that the studios don't have to waste 100+ million on movies for them to be great. All it takes is a decent Director with an imagination and a good crew and good actors to pull it off, which is something we don't have too much of here in the US lately. See this movie and I promise it will not disappoint, just leave the kiddies home and for those of you that may frighten easily make sure you have someone you can hold on to. I give 28 days later a, well deserved, 10 out of 10!",28 Days Later...
719,jimsmith-too,"I went to a press screening and was lucky enough to meet Danny Boyle, Alex Garland and Andrew McDonald",9,8 November 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** They answered alot of questions from the floor, most of which have answered the questions on the message boards about this film.Firstly, the film is good, in a low-budget post-apocalyptic kind of way. It's filmed entirely on a Canon LX (about £1500) and has a low budget (reportedly $15 million, although i get the picture alot of that was spent in post production, market research and advertising). It's not a zombie movie as such, although it does have remarkable similarities to that genre.Basically the plot revolves around Jim, a bike courier who wakes up in a hospital several weeks after being hit by a truck, only to find he is alone. He's in a locked room, naked, and his call for help are ignored. Searching around, he finds the key to the door on the floor, as if someone locked him in and slid the key under to him (weird...) so he lets himself out and tries to find someone, anyone. There's noone around, noone at all. So, he does what anyone who's been out for weeks would do; he gorges himself on chocolate and sugary soft drinks. That over he wanders out into town.Strangely, London is deserted. London. Yes, London. DESERTED.
Anyone who lives in london will no how weird that is. Noone ever tries to do a London deserted, it never looks the part. this time it does...Anyway, Jim eventually stumbles into a church and finds it full of bodies. When he calls out to them, a good dozen or so leap up and charge him. Before you know it, he's on the run, and that's where it all really kicks off.oh, and i forgot to mention the prelude with the animal rights activists letting the crazed monkeys out...The rest of the film chronicles a story of survival, how Jim and the few survivors he meets try to make sense of the tragedy while staying alive. This is why i like the movie, the fact that it's more about the characters and how they can cope with their situation, than the situation they are in. This, i think, is why comparisons to literary classics like 'The day of the Triffids' or films like 'Dawn of the Dead' are justified; they really do stand out amongst their contemporaries since they tackle the issue of human survival head on. The Triffids had those walking plants, Dawn had the zombies, but unlike most of their kind, the zombies/plants/whatever were the problem, not the stars of the show. And, like in 28 Days later, the cast don't make stupid mistakes, they try to survive, at all costs. In this movie, look out for how Selena deals with the bite Mark gets in Jim's house. Wow...Now, i live in Greenwich, a stones throw from where Jim lives in the film, plus my name is Jim too, so when i introduced myself to Boyle & Garland in that way, i got a laugh out of them and hit them with the following questions, which they answered fairly truthfully. so let's round up a few things.1 Zombies. Zombie plagues always have causes relating directly to the current national phobia. In the 60/70s it was radiation, now it's chemical warfare. Let's face it, these days the concept of zombies just don't cut it with popular culture; we just can't take them seriously. many thanks to Michael Jackson for that, eh? Now, though, the world is worried about chemical warfare; anthrax, smallpox, whatever, that's a real worry. That's exactly why these 'zombies' are chemically infected, disease is a very real worry. Mind you, so is rage. Danny Boyle loved the concept of the psychological virus, everyone who lives in London has experienced rage; tube rage, road rage, bus rage, supermarket trolley rage, everything. Rage is good, and Alex Garland said he wanted to get away from the cheap staggering zombies thing, he wanted turbo charged and highly infectious crazies. I added that is was refreshing that head shots weren't the only killer, that got another laugh...2 Deserted London. You can't stop the traffic in London, you can simply 'ask' them to wait a minute. By filming at 4am, and by getting pretty ladies to do the traffic stopping, Boyle and McDonald managed intervals of at most 2 minutes, over 4 mornings, to shoot as much footage as possible with eight digital cameras. The rest is in the editing. That's one of the reasons why there are no bodies...3 Where are all the bodies? Well, mainly because of the reason above. The three of them also remembered Kosovo, where bodies were piled up in churchs, and decided to mimic that, hence the big body pile up church scene.4 Product placement. Take this example; Jim wanders through the hospital, past a popular UK coffee shop chain, to a foyer where he gets soft drinks and chocolates from a vending machine. Thing is, that stuff is there, in London branding is EVERYWHERE, so why hide it?* SPOILERS *5 The end. Upbeat hollywood trash? Well, they did film 2 endings; in the alternate ending Jim doesn't make it off the hospital bed at the end. Would that have been better than the supposedly happy ending? Alex Garland said firstly that nearly everyone is dead so that's hardly happy. Secondly, he pointed out that after getting emotionally attached to characters for the last two hours, the audiences that saw the test screening with the downer ending HATED it. He said that audiences often think they want the downbeat arty ending but actually want the happy one.You know what, he might be right ;)",28 Days Later...

Please, has anybody never told the editors the importance of saturation control and contrast? It's hard to be scared when the whole movie is so dark that only the huge pixels leap out in a very frightening manner.You care nothing for the characters only wishing that they die putting you out of your misery.The idea of rage and hate being a disease was wasted on this over-long MTV video desperately looking for an eighties rock track to give it substance.When Christopher Eccelston finally arrives to save the day, even he can't save the film.In the end all you think is so what?

721,egglestc,Heart pounding stuff,8,27 May 2003,"This gore fest has its roots firmly in many zombie flicks. I have to say its about 80% a great film but fall apart with shoddy over-emphasis in the script being played out at the deserted manor house. That scene should have been cut down and another one added after. I had had enough of the manor house after about 15 mins, why not have more of City scenes outside London or indeed England.The emptiness was quite haunting, I can see it now Deserted Ports, empty football stadiums, train stations, with trains waiting(hey they could Joy-ride all sorts of transport, Jumbo jets!!) And why didn't they got to the nearest army camp and get themselves armed properly, RPG's, Guns and explosives. Oh yes I can see  a cycle of Beautiful arty shots of the deserted public places  and the countryside blending into brutal barberry of the unfortunate zombies. Sorry gone off on one there.Anyway the real film, certainly was better than most you will see these days (or in 28 days time) and it really did have my heart pounding (not sure if it was the film or the cocktail of 3 lts of Coke, large Chocolate bar and Popcorn) but either way go and watch it if you like the idea of an empty London (No slow moving packs of Tourists, no guide busses, no Taxi's unwilling to take you South off the river)full over flesh eating Zombies.Only have one question.Why is the main character naked at the beginning in Hospital? Is it some criticism of the NHS not having enough blankets? British Directors often think this is some sort of Arty thought provoking comment. If you find women attractive the last thing you want to be confronted by at the beginning of film your looking forward to watching is that. It was very unnecessary and would have be bemoaned to the ends of the earth had it been a woman.Close your eyes for the first 30 seconds and you might want to do so later on in the movie as well.

The 1st 15 minutes of the film give it a creepy, eerie feeling (the church scene), but soon just becomes an uncreative in-your-face boo-fest.I mean, they stress the fact that the people need to be killed within 20-40 secs upon infection - before they become a bloodthirsty hemorroid.. but the killing of the zombies don't require much effort either so it doesn't make much difference.Again, throughout the movie most folks with half a brain will be cringing in the seats not because of the gore or fear factor, but because of the poor assessment the characters make of the situations.  I mean cmon, we're dealing with a highly infectious disease and yet no one takes the extra effort to protect themselves from infection.

It's not about people who get bitten, die and somehow, without any explanation, come back to life. They are infected with a blood virus, which contains rage. I also love another thing about this movie, the fact that it shows you that there are worse things to fear than your own death. Like the death of your loved ones, family. This was shown with Frank's death, which I think was masterfully done, one of the best, most touching death scenes ever. The last part of the movie where everyone is basically killed, except for the three main characters was a bit abrupt, in my opinion. Still a great movie, with meaning. It also contains some of my favorite actors, like Brendan Gleeson, Cillian Murphy and Christopher Eccleston. Watch it, it's not a clichéd horror zombie flick, it's a well written drama.",28 Days Later...
725,acharra27,Amazing story,8,28 June 2003,"I am not a horror movie fan, but I do enjoy an occasional suspense. This movie was really amazing, just for the story alone.The lead characters were believable, although...at times I did have to ask 'Why are you going in there alone, you moron?' - specifically with Jim in mind.  The Road Warrior-esque deserted landscape was particularly interesting.  I would like to know how they managed to completely unpopulate London so convincingly.The director, Danny Boyle, also directed Trainspotting, which is almost half the reason I decided to see the movie - the other half being that I'm a fan of Alex Garland.  Danny Boyle's style is excellent, very dark with intense direction.  It fit very well as did the video format, choppy movements and slightly blurred images.  Very convincing, gave you a feeling of dark desolation and confusion, which the characters no doubt felt.  The movie was a bit gory, but necessary.Overall I feel that the movie was well done.  Surprisingly.  I am still afraid to see the Beach, afraid of how the book may have been butchered. I felt this was just very good, as far as 'horror' movies go.",28 Days Later...
726,catanmax,28 days later is a classic end of the world movie.,10,7 February 2004,"28 days later begins I think much the way a sequel to Resident Evil the movie would begin. Jim wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by drips and wires but no people, he gets up to find the door of his hospital room has been locked and the key pushed under the door. He puts on some clothes and makes his way through the hospital, it is completely deserted. As is the streets which are littered with rubbish, he begins to collect things off the streets he feels he may need, drinks, and even money, he carries them in a plastic bag, it is so quiet you could hear a pin drop. He makes his way through the city until he comes to what seems to be a shrine, it is covered in pictures of 'loved ones' the pictures include photos of families, even young children. Jim still doesn't know what has happened but things are beginning to piece together bit by bit. Common sense tells him something has taken out the population although he doesn't know yet it was a virus. He enters a chapel, as he walks along the upper balcony he looks down over the 'congregation' to see bodies scattered around everywhere, there doesn't seem to be anyone left alive, that is until Jim says 'Hello'...
28 days later is a classic end of the world movie. These type of movies are my favourite kind of thriller. As I said before if you have seen Resident Evil the movie I am sure you would agree that this movie could almost be a continuation of what would happen with a sequel to it. The scariest thing for me about the movie was the speed of the infected. They are much like zombies, once the virus enters the bloodstream the victim becomes infected within 10-20 seconds, not much time to say your goodbyes. However these 'zombies' move fast, gone are the days of movies like 'Day Of The Dead', where if you had to you could just run past your attacker! Once these critters are on your tail they are hard to shake off.",28 Days Later...
727,kulltheconquerer,What horror should be,8,24 October 2003,"28 Days Later is true horror, relying on characterization, mood and atmosphere instead of cheap shock or excessive fanboy gore.  Here we get people we care about trapped in a nightmarish circumstance and their fate very well might be inescapeable.  The film is dark and depressing throughout and up until the last scene you're not sure if the good guys will win or lose.  The DVD does give it to you both ways though via the 3 alternate endings.  I prefer the happier finish, but if you want to walk away completely depressed you can do that too. :)",28 Days Later...
728,Joust,A Rare and Unique Timeless Gem,8,19 January 2004,"'28 Days Later' is Boyle's best to date.  It grasped every aspect in film that we all look for and was intricately delivered with masterful vision. This film instantly flung itself onto my personal top ten list, and I feel that it will easily be a reknowned classic in the future, much like how 'Citizen Kane' was overlooked at first and has its towering status now.  The biggest thing it has going against it is how it is marketed-- as a horror film (which was the flaw for Shyamalan's 'Signs').  Horror is an art form that is easily swept aside to make way for the domineering drama pieces. So, even though it isn't horror, it is labeled that because of the unwise advertising choices. What Boyle acheived was a top-notch thriller with a story that was strangely reminiscent of Hitchcock's masterpieces.  The element of surprise was always there-- if you say you didn't jump, you're a liar. This superior film is a strong 8 out of 10 stars, and will be one of those few and unique timeless gems.  Whatever you do, don't miss this one.",28 Days Later...

Perhaps one of the most sophisticated thrillers, this film never misses a beat and strives to pummel the viewer into submission by attacking our deepest fears: loneliness, isolation, disease, hate, etc. By examining these issues, Boyle address the true nature of what creates a zombie, while in the process deconstructing the entire zombie sub-genre.

However, how feasible is that concept in terms of trying to make this a realistic zombie survival?A rather intelligent one i personally feel.Along with the edge-of-your-seat moments, this is a great film to sit back and watch with friends, family or loved-ones.Get the popcorn in for this!",28 Days Later...
731,piousbox,"among top 10, on my list",10,15 January 2005,"this movie is absolutely great and should not be missed. though i think if i watched it 3 years ago i would not appreciate it so much, so i understand why its so low-rated. but it really should be like 8.3/10 or so.the movie has an apocalyptic theme, i.e. everybody dies, and there is no hope-like. still, i consider it an ultimately 'good' movie, one that affirms the goodness of human heart. one of the central questions raised by the movie is this: in complete hopelessness and despair, what is there to live for, what is more to life than mere surviving? the movie does have an answer. a horror movie, but could as well be a modified psychological drama.that is substance. style -- oh, style is just amazing. the film was shot on digital cameras, very dynamic. most scenes have a photographic quality to them. you can literally freeze almost any frame and get a poster, or at least a very good photograph. consequently, no matter what actually happens at any particular scene, it is still a pleasure to watch -- like watching a slide show of good photos. there should be more such movies. (Frida and A clockwork orange are examples of movies with EVERY scene carefully and superbly produced)style of speech is realistic and down-to-earth, street-like. anti comic book, i'd say. like, in pop American movies characters with over-boosted ego speak in this pathetic unrealistic style, like 'i know i'm a good guy and i'll KILL YOU, and y'know it.' But here its different. notice when Jim and Samantha meet Frank and his daughter, and Frank says ""I'm Frank, anyway"" -- it is so... real, so true. very nostalgic, for me at least. (i'm a European living in the U.S.)the army spirit is depicted realistically. the base commander reminds of Apocalypse Now. Same moral deterioration, same outlet of despair.the plot could not be any better. first Jim finds himself alone, lucky to see any survivors at all, then their little squad is able to reach a fortified 'heaven', then... watch the movie.for many viewers the most important thing in any movie is main characters, how much they like them, how they can associate with them. in this respect 28 d. l. too strikes a high point. the characters are great. the 'big softy' Frank in particular...the only real objection anyone may have is the ridiculously short developing period of the decease. 20 sec -- and the infected has a fully developed Rage. this is scientific nonsense. however, it makes the movie extremely dynamic, and i think it works.i give this movie 10, because everything in it -- the theme, the characters, the style -- appeal to me. it's surely among top ten for me.",28 Days Later...

But then my friend got it for me for Christmas, so I naturally had to see it.I was expecting a typical zombie movie, but slightly different and slightly better. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised or what! This film is not your typical zombie movie-as a matter of fact, it really doesn't involve zombies at all-it involves people being infected with 'rage'. This is all I will say about that, I don't want to spoil it.The thing that made this film stand out, both in the horror genre and films in general, was it's style and craft. The photography is shot in a way that keeps on the edge the whole time, and the music is not your typical horror symphony, but rather simple electric guitar and percussion. This having been said, it was no doubt some of the creepiest film music that I have ever heard-it sent shivers down my spine! But this is all I should really mention-in order to truly enjoy this gem, you've got to see it and find out things for yourself.

733,charlotte_cloud,"gory, in a realistic way.",8,13 April 2004,"This is profoundly not a horror movie, never in Danny Boyle's life would he tie his films down to any notions of genre or audience expectation. Most audience members expect a true genre movie, but this was not Boyle's goal. Some don't find the film scary enough, but do they not find the idea of being isolated and practically powerless in a nation overrun by a virus nobody can stop slightly disturbing? Or would they prefer Arnie to come out of a bush with a machine gun and obliterate some zombie scum? the disurbing thing about this film is that it seems so real, for example, it takes ages to kill a zombie because the survivors are not superheroes. it is shot like any social-realism film, like Boyle's Trainspotting it remains as true to the actual nature of humanity as possible, even though it discusses zombies and post-apocalyptic Britain. Sorry, it's not dawn of the dead, but it is real and in that respect it is disturbing. Perhaps the American audience would also benefit from background information, like all the havoc that viruses like BSE and Foot and Mouth have caused in the UK in order to find the film more disturbing? It may suffer from being a bit too culturally exclusive, but this did not hinder my enjoyment. I found it cool and wouldn't object to seeing it over and over.",28 Days Later...
734,mauvais,Day of the Triffids minus the triffids,4,26 April 2004,"**Possible spoilers**This movie would have been so much more fun with the triffids.  After all, it preserves almost every other character, locale and plot twist from the John Wyndham novel (without attribution).  Rage as a disease transmitted through blood and bodily fluids is the menace here, and an enthralling premise.  But it disintegrates when our hero goes native to defend his womenfolk.  What are we to think as our gentle, boyish leading man half-nakedly pounces on a would-be defiler and gouges his eyeballs with his bare thumbs?  Perhaps that rage is part of the human condition, and that it can be put to productive use when administered by slender, handsome boys with an accute sense of justice and chastity.  It's not a message that resonates with me.  This is one of those movies where, halfway through, I start rooting for the monsters.  The characters are cool kids wandering through an appocalypse like advertisements for the Trainspotting generation, totally unaware of their own glamour.  They elicit about as much sympathy as Tanqueray models (with the exception of the father character, who should have been the one to survive, but who could not have been in this movie since he's over thirty).  I will say that there are some lovely cinematic moments, particularly in the first half of the film and the sequences of a deserted London.  There are moments where the narrative pauses so that the lens can make leisurely poetry.  But ultimately Boyle and company have failed to take into account the lesson of previous apocalypse films, including one of the greatest, Dr. Strangelove: that you cannot tell such stories without a sense of humor.  Even George Romero knew that.",28 Days Later...
735,marknovack,Not at all what I expected. Just another zombie movie with a bad ending.,5,25 March 2005,"After reading the the reviews I took the time to see the movie. What a disappointment. Well made, reasonably budgeted, not terrible acting, what started out as a promising movie turned into a monster movie thriller of zero depth after 10 minutes. There was a good shock scare in the first twenty minutes, after wards, all the horror relied on gore and camera angles because the story lost any sensible momentum and direction and proceeded in a direction that reeks of lazy writing and a ""just get it into the theaters"" attitude. If you are looking for a thriller with a message, keep looking. Battlefield Earth had more of a message than this film, at least it had a betrayal. I gave it 5 stars because its better than a B film, but if I was rating it on what it claimed to be, it would have earned only 1. The ending was also weak. Filmmakers should be aware that writing a weak and confusing ending is not the same as being artistic and creative. Its like they hope viewers are all so dimwitted and will be so confused that they think its awesome because its beyond their comprehension, except that in this movie there is nothing to comprehend. Its a shame because the opening moments gave promise and hope for a good film.NOTE: I think kids will LOVE this film. Parents must determine if they are mature enough to handle watching because the only message contained in the film is that British soldiers become rapists in times of zombies (poor taste). It will keep them up for nights on end terrified of the dark.",28 Days Later...
736,resimaster,Complete and utter rip off.,2,28 February 2005,"Not only is this film boring and dull, but it is also no where near as original as everyone thinks.The whole virus concept has been used millions of times- e.g.Resident Evil (i hate the film but I'm using it here as an example. The games are much better)so why does everyone think that 28 is so great? Also, this is NOT a zombie film. Zombies don't run and we are told that these people are infected with 'rage'. Yeah, we all feel like that sometimes don't we? These are called 'the infected' as if that gives them some sort of excuse... I am a student and i went for an interview at Salisbury College where i was told lots of people helped to make the 'zombies' for 28. See, people don't know what zombies are any more...The whole storyline is ripped off a book called 'Plague' that i read in year 8 about the black death. It has the deserted London setting, and comes complete with a young girl coming home to find her parents dead in bed together having left her a note. Really Danny Boyle, Trainspotting was great but cant you be that original more often with your films? For my last point, everyone says how great the opening is with Jim coming out of the hospital and seeing deserted London, but I've got news for you. Its already been done! If you have ever seen 'Day of the Triffids' then you will know that the film opens with a meteor shower and then a man wakes up in a hospital with signs of chaos, things knocked over and glass broken, then he walks outside and finds that London is silent and deserted. He even walks past a bus lying on its side. I think that if Danny Boyle wanted this film to be any sort of a tribute then he should have made it clear in the documentaries.",28 Days Later...

738,chodefacemcgee69,best 'zombie' movie in years,10,14 August 2005,"I thought this movie was EXCELLENT! There have been very few 'zombie' movies coming out in recent years that are worth the price of the movie ticket, but this movie goes above and beyond my expectations. Unlike many zombie movies, this movie is actually emotional. The suspense and focus of the movie is not based on the gore, but on the characters themselves. The character's feeling influence your own in some ways, and add to the suspense.The cinematography was beautifully done, and some shots add to the suspense/horror without the aid of cheesy and outdated methods or corny music.Some complain that the storyline is unoriginal or uninspired, but halfway through the movie the plot is reversed as the main characters' problems shift from the zombies to the barbaric soldiers holding them hostage. I agree, the whole virus thing has been done, but seriously, how many somewhat reasonable ways are there to bring about a worldwide zombie outbreak?? The reason for the zombies being there is not something new, but the rest of the plot is imaginative.Also, critics may claim that some parts are unrealistic without thinking things through. Why would the Manchester fire drive the infected out if light attracts them? The infected can be killed by conventional means, so the smoke would suffocate them. Isn't it unrealistic that Cillian Murphy, upon realizing that the entire city is abandoned would be so calm? Well, not everyone would go into hysterics and start crying and screaming. Being scared doesn't always impair one's ability to think ahead, hence Cillian picking up Pepsi for later, realizing that if everything is abandoned he might get thirsty later. Why is Cillian able to walk the streets for hours without seeing a single zombie if everyone is infected? The zombies are afraid of light; as Selena and Mark said, they can travel only by day. So before making judgments people should think things through. Either way, this is a ZOMBIE movie, how can anyone really expect it to be extremely realistic? I have heard people complain that the movie is boring. 28 Days Later is not a conventional zombie movie. That is what sets it apart. Some parts reflect the horror genre, and some reflect something other than the aspects of just a zombie movie. This is NOT another Dawn of the Dead. This is a great movie, but people need to realize that it is different, and must be appreciated for that. Sure, its not perfect, but it is as close to perfection as a zombie movie can get.",28 Days Later...

741,NASH777,WOW! There's a zombie in all of us!,9,6 July 2003,"28 Days Later is not just a horror movie, it's a movie you actually need to think through. The comments about this movie being a terrible waste of time and that it doesn't live up to Trainspotting, are by people who missed the first 10 minutes of the movie or didn't understand what happened. Trainspotting (I agree) is an amazing movie which is ALSO a movie that you think through. I believe it's now apparent from other peoples comments that monkey's are released by animal activists containing a virus, which spreads throughout the country side. The collage in the beginning directly relates to the LA riots in a attempt to control the human emotion of RAGE. The scientist (David Schneider) even explains that to develop a cure (to rage), the monkey's must be infected (similar to the idea in Mission Impossible 2). This crucial idea that being infected by RAGE instigates the violent side of humans. It is the rage in human nature to attack, destroy, mutilate all other people who are not infected by the disease. Maybe people are familiar with the slogan, ""You're either with us or against us"" which becomes the mentality for the ""zombies"". The infected lose their sense of right and wrong and feed off their hate and bloodlust. The idea that the movie portrays ""zombies"" is just an identifying factor that allows the viewer to determine who is and isn't infected. People everyday are infected by rage and their lives are run by anger. This is why the scientists in the beginning are trying to develop a cure for OUR disease. The monkey's are not being tested for body products, but for an actual GOOD cause.This movie is not your typical horror movie with body counts and bad movie lines. The script written by Alex Garland can stand alone with its insightful thoughts and realistic story line, but it's the true vision of Danny Boyle that makes this movie a classic like Trainspotting with the cinematography. 28 Days Later will be a film that will live on and become a cult classic because no matter what, rage will always be in our lives and there's a zombie in all of us.",28 Days Later...

744,trillian28,Intelligent Zombie-like Horror,9,6 September 2005,"Usually, when a genre begins to spoof and make meta-comments about itself, it means that the genre is dying. This was the case with Westerns and musicals, but somehow, the meta-flick ""Scream"" and the spoof series ""Scary Movie"" seem to have revitalized the horror genre. The last few years have seen a number of fresh new angles on the horror archetypes, including ""The Others,"" ""The Ring"" and ""Dawn of the Dead."" The best of the new crop of re-energized horror/thrillers is definitely ""28 Days Later."" The premise of the film is that a bio-engineered virus turns regular humans into mindless, hungry killers, turning England into a post-apocalyptic war zone in the space of 28 days. During this time, Jim (Cillian Murphy, of ""Batman"") has been in a coma. He wakes up in this nightmare, and with the help of some fellow survivors tries to find a way to escape.The movie was criticized by ""Shaun of the Dead"" (also brilliant) for not being a true zombie movie: the zombie-like monsters are not dead, and they move with uncharacteristic speed. Still, the premise of the comatose hero was stolen gracefully in Robert Kirkman's ""Walking Dead"" comic, and in the forward to that comic, it says that what defines a good zombie story, more than anything, is the way human protagonists react to their situation-- when everything we have ever known, and ever wanted, becomes useless, how do we keep going?That is what makes this movie spectacular. Indeed, the zombies are not even the scariest villains-- the things that man does to man (and a little girl) in this movie are much more horrifying. At the same time, characters must sacrifice themselves to save the innocent, they must steal in order to survive, and at every step, they must question their morals, their priorities, and discover what makes them human. This film is a tremendous achievement, intelligent and gripping, that can be enjoyed by fans of genre and mainstream movies alike.",28 Days Later...
745,leonardo-24,"Intelligent, scary, well acted film",9,25 July 2003,"Contains SpoilersLike other reviewers who really enjoyed this film, I would like to comment on all the negative remarks posted on IMDB. If one considers who the target audience is for the standard Hollywood horror flick, (young males) then it's really not that surprising that so many people didn't like 28 Days Later. Let's see: there was no bad acting, no senseless gore, no big-breasted bimbos running in the woods being chased by a zombie, no gratuitous sex scenes, in fact, no female nudity of any kind. However, there was plenty of male nudity, including a full frontal shot of the lovely Cillian Murphy. I heard and witnessed the uncomfortable comments and reactions from some of the audience members to the opening scene where the lead character, Jim, wakes up completely naked in a hospital, a rare sight in American movies.Instead, Danny Boyle has created a thoughtful, intelligent, and well acted film that uses the devastation created by a virus to explore the human condition with all its flaws, weaknesses, and penchant for violence. The movie is filled with wonderful, haunting scenes, I was especially impressed by the opening shots of Jim aimlessly wandering through an abandon London, and by the sight of Manchester burning in the horizon as the survivors reached the army check point. One of my favorite moments was when Jim, Selena, Hannah, and Frank go shopping in an abandoned super market, and for a brief moment forget about the dangers awaiting them.The acting was top notch, Brendan Gleeson as Frank and Christopher Eccleston, as Major Henry, were particularly effective, while Cillian Murphy turned out to be a huge revelation: a talented, beautiful, young actor, with terrific screen presence. For those disappointed by 28 Days Later, I suggest you go see Freddy vs. Jason, the trailer I saw promises all the prerequisite gore, stupidity, and bimbos your little hearts desire.",28 Days Later...

If I can compare this film to anything it would be The Last Of Us, a video game that came out a few years back. Without saying too much, just when you think it's over, it's not. Also, without giving up too much of a spoiler the ending allows you to figure out what happens next. Sometimes I don't usually like endings like that, but here I feel like it works.

751,JamesPaganiniActor,Best zombie/survival movie ever made,10,7 October 2009,"28 Days later is my second favourite film ever made. It's superb in the way that the whole of Britain has been wiped out by a virus which turns people into fast zombies. Jim (Cillian Murphey) wakes up hospital from a coma to find London completely empty...except for the infected. He eventually finds 2 survivors, Selena (Naomi Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley). Selena and Mark explain to Jim about what's happened in the last 28 days. The 3 of them journey to Jim's house to discover his parents dead. In my favourite scene from the film, Mark gives a chilling story about what happened to his parents. That scene is well acted by Noah Huntley and it makes it even more shocking when Mark is hacked to death by Selena moments later. We grow attached to all the characters in the film and i thought that Mark would play an even more important part. Jim and Selena then come across a man called Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). The 4 of them hear a radio transmission from soldiers in Manchester and that makes them journey there in a cab. The 2nd part of the film is really Jim, Frank, Selena and Hannah trying to make there way to Manchester. But sadly Frank gets infected and dies when they finally meet up with the soldiers. The last part of the film i don't really like because it goes down a darker road than the rest of the film. The lead soldier, Major West (Christopher Eccleston) has promised the rest of his soldiers Women and Selena and Hannah are on the verge of being raped. Jim, Selena and Hannah not only have to fight of the infected but also the soldiers. Overall 28 Days Later is an excellent film and it never gets boring.

753,wavelengthgames,"So many holes, so little time.",1,30 June 2003,"Spoilers Warning.  If you haven't seen it, all you need to know is that it's dumb, loud, semi-gory, and souless.  If you still want to see it, then don't read on because I'll ""spoil"" (if it's possible to ruin this movie further) the plotline and ending.First of all, there is no empathy for any of the main characters.  Life is so cheapened, virutally from the opening scenes when ""Mark"" is remorselessly hacked up by his companion Selena (within minutes of us getting to know him), that you accept the other characters are just so much fodder.  The feeble attempt to establish humanity for Jim by trekking to his parents house only made him more contempable.  He's a bicycle messenger who sponges off his parents and his ""flashback"" consists of guzzling their orange juice straight from the carton.  Oops, sorry Dad, I drank it all!  Sniff, Sniff.The only character with any sort of humanity, Frank, is then killed off in a stupid fashion, with a single drop of zombie blood hitting his eye.  This, after all of them have had countless hackfests with bloodspurting zombies and never managing to get a drop in their mouth or eyes - come on.His loving, devoted daughter shows about as much remorse for Frank's death as Selena did when she hacked Mark into cordwood.  Even Selena has to remind Jim, ""How do you think she feels, she just lost her dad"".  I was with Jim on this one, I couldn't tell how she felt either.Don't even get me started on the Zombies.  Why exactly would they go seeking out only the uninfected?  Why wouldn't they fight each other?  They don't attack for food, just sport, so why wouldn't another Zombie make a good target?  The scene in the military courtyard is just too much.  Here's a chained up Zombie just looking to get at the commander and what does he do - he pukes on the ground.  Didn't he see the excorcist?  He could have just hurled at him!  Or at least spit - and the commander obliges by even putting his face right down next to the enraged Zombie.Then there's the forced relationship between Jim and Selena, which culminates in a zombie bloodied kiss. (you can't tell me they didn't get infected on that kiss). You never get the idea that they really care for each other so much as they want to stay on each others good side.  So, the characters are not sympathetic.  To me, if you're going to be scared, you have to care about who's being threatened.  In the case of 28 days, you never care.Since I didn't know the ending of the movie going in, I was sort of surprised.  I see by reading other reviews that some people still don't get it.  *SPOILER WARNING*  The virus is contained to the UK! Ok, so that might make for a good plot had the movie been well made, but here's the problem. Jim is made wise to the fact that the UK has been quarantined by the ravings of the Sargent, and then by seeing the plane go overhead.  You can't tell me, that in 28 days, the other survivors did not see or hear a plane go overhead!  C'mon people, the world was supposed to be reduced to savages. How many regularly scheduled planes would fly over UK airspace on a normal day?   That and the fact that the military was obviously searching for the uninfected.So, in summary, the characters are wooden, the plot is full of holes and it's not scary.",28 Days Later...
754,martinbarrett63,Very Good Indeed,9,4 November 2002,"This film brings something new to the genre. Difficult to describe, it somehow manages to be more convincing, more real, and produced a more intense physical reaction from me than I have ever experienced in the cinema before.Perhaps the key is the random ordinariness of the main characters, and the familiar-but-different background - both story and scenery. Whatever the technical reasons, I know I nearly crushed my girlfriend's hand a couple of times, and it was the closest I have ever been to the definitively futile gesture that is yelling advice to the characters on the screen.It's certainly true that some of the scenes are ""borrowed"" from famous apocalyptic film visions of the past, but it's no worse for that. There has been more effort to make the story hang together than most, and it's only where budget constraints have restricted the maker's freedom that the plot creaks a bit. There are only a couple of Alex Garland's trademark mistakes in the script, which for him is better than average.Coming so soon after ""Dog Soldiers"", a very different but very entertaining film, I wonder if this could be an indication that the UK industry can challenge Hollywood in mainstream, non-costume drama, cinema. I look forward to seeing how both films do in the US and think that with the right marketing they could be huge.I would also like to find out whether the version being shown in cinemas now has been changed at all from the original.",28 Days Later...

For me though it took up until the survivors were 'rescued' by the soldiers for the film to come to life, definitely the second portion of the film was far more superior to the first and things got much better from them on.I like Danny Boyle's work, always have and the look and sound of the film was a major highlight, it gave our cinema sound system an excellent work out but looking at the film as a whole only lets me rate it as a 6...maybe it would have been different if I would have not looked at the ratings first and expected more...but I have the DVD for a week so it will be getting watched again.",28 Days Later...

The violence, in terms of a supernatural movie, was necessary and realistic.  Then.....The second half of this movie loses it's way and loses it big time.

760,Parallax-UK,The days are numbered for the British film industry...,1,1 November 2002,"I first saw this film at a test screening about 6 months ago. I decided not to post a review then, as I assumed that there was no way the film would be released as it was, considering the reaction of the test audience. However, it was.The trailer actually makes the film appear to be quite promising. The audience is promised a tale of virus-ravaged UK, and one man's ordeal to survive. Upon seeing the film, the ordeal is suffered by the audience, who thankfully only have just short of two hours to get through.The film does indeed begin with a virus being let loose upon the good citizens of Great Britain. After the brief set up, we join Jim (Murphy), a bicycle courier who was locked in a hospital room during the initial 28 days, waking from a coma. After the much publicised scenes of Jim staggering around a deserted London, he hooks up with love interest Selena, and a father and daughter. The quintuplet then embark upon a mostly tedious journey to Manchester, where Major West (Ecclestone) resides over a military base.The problems with this film are numerous. The script is abysmal, and is not helped along by the performances of the leads. The dull lines are droned out by Murphy in a whinge-like monotone, whilst the usually excellent Christopher Ecclestone delivers his lines like he's in the school play. Thankfully, single-father Frank (Brendan Gleeson) is performed thoughtfully and with warmth. It is a great credit to Gleeson that he turns in such a performance when given such a disgraceful script.The film is also not helped by the story. It is so ludicrous in places that Jim could have hopped on the London bus at the beginning of the film and driven it through many of the holes. For a capital that has been ravaged by a virus, and evacuated, there is remarkably little evidence left behind. Where are all the vehicles? Why have the shops not been looted?**********SPOILER PARAGRAPH**************** To top the lot, we are expected to believe that an entire army unit has a) managed to do what apparently only four other people have achieved by staying alive, and b) have gone mad. Have they gone mad because of the virus? No. They've just gone mad. That's it. **********END OF SPOILER*******************The film looks cheap. Not in a stylish, atmospheric way - it just looks cheap. To give credit where it's due, the zombie attack scenes are reasonably effective. They are powerful and violent enough to ramp up the tension, but this only contrasts to make the rest of the film feel even lamer.Perhaps the must heinous crime this film commits is that it is excruciatingly boring. A number of people at the test screening actually got up and left. Considering test screenings are free, that goes some way towards explaining just how dull the film is.I think I've made my point. Two minutes of genuinely scary zombie attacks do not constitute a sufficient payoff for sitting through what is, in summary, a very poor, dull, cheap-looking, boring film. Avoid like the Rage virus - if you go in to this film, it will feel like you're leaving it 28 days later.",28 Days Later...

762,pollocka,Spoilers,6,11 November 2002,"It was a pretty good film. Whilst not specifically about Zombies it was definitely a movie in the zombie genre.The first half was interesting and entertaining, the film asked some serious questions but provided few answers. The sargeant said that the zombies wouldn't get across the seas and oceans, but can we really believe not one of them made it across the Channel or through the Chunnel? The behavior of the soldiers I would think would be better IRL but that is perhaps me wanting the best from a British squaddie.The sound was not very good, often music or ambient noise overpowered the dialogue. They also used the same camera effect as in the opening battle scene of Saving Private Ryan. I don't know what it is but it makes it look very jerky like they are shooting at 20frames per second, and was particularly bad during a the rain scene at the blockade.However, for a 21st century look at the zombie movie, it is okay, set upon a typically dark and bleak British backdrop which I like anyway, perhaps the fact it was set in Britain saved it for me.",28 Days Later...
763,jharmer,Unusual and disturbing,8,15 November 2002,"A capable addition to the ""post-apocalyptic"" genre, 28 Days Later is an disturbing and frightening film, despite a number of plot holes.The early scenes of a deserted and abandoned London are masterfully done and add to the sense of unease.  Regardless of the unwarranted critiscm of ""product-placement"" it is vital to maintain our believe in the realism of what we are seeing.  The lack of a known cast (with the exception of Christopher Eccleston) adds to the impact of ""normality gone wrong.""Building up the disturbing sensation for me were the scenes in the north of England, where motorway signs were clearly recognisable as those near Preston, even though the actual location was elsewhere and didn't match the plot.Unfortunately, the film is somewhat let down by a poor script and some duff acting.

Vanished away? What? Later in the film people were climbing over mountains of corpses but none to see at the beginning? Uhuhuh...2. There should be no electricity. But obviously there are some windgenerators shown in the movie later on.3. There is a band of soldiers who survived all by themselves. Is that believable, that this one unit has survived, build there fort but there should be no others left to be contacted? No CB, no radio, nothing?4. Why are the infected people just going for the non-infected? The virus claimed to be a virus  of anger, why not kill anything in the way?5. When the whole towns are deserted, why go with knives and baseballclubs? What about some nicy spicy pumpguns from your next police-station, weapondealer or military base?6. Why are the protagnonists WALKING to Jims parents house? No more cars and gasoline there?

Point 1: Original, no it is tripe it has ripped off lots of bad plots from other bad apolocalypse films (B-Movie style movies).Point 2: Some of the camera work is incredible.  A bonus point for the film.Point 3: Enjoyable, well no, and there are so many plot holes it is difficult to know where to begin, and I have neither the space nor time to detail them all.Point 4: This film mentions it's two great cliches, the Woman surviors says at one point something to the effect of ""Do you want to Fall in love and screw or start rebuilding the human race"" unfortuantely these are the two things that kind of happen (although the squaddies bit is all the immature Rape fantasy of the writer rather than a madman planning to rebuild the human race)Point 5: Unnessecary Gore.  Pushing your thumbs into someones eyes is not the fastest way of killing someone (after all speed is of the essence here) strangulation is faster.Point 6: Desperation.  Actually it is funny when they are in the supermarket as I thought they sould be attacked there, they spend lots of time being uncaring and messing about.  However when in a relatively open area (i.e. refuelling the taxi) they are really cautious.All in all I advise no one to see this film, watch day of the dead or even Resident Evil (which is similar and has no plot, poor acting and more plot inconsistancies than 28 days later, but I enjoy a whole lot more).

768,goofrider,Refreshing and original (4/5),9,20 December 2003,"It might be misleading to call it the most original zombie flick.The truth is, it's a zombie flick at heart, it's just a different kind of zombie flick. It plays homage to zombie movies, so a lot of the typical zombie flick formulas are still present.The typical zombie flick is all chessy gore, and it underlines a subplot of how the evil in human may be more horrifying than the man-eating zombies. Danny Boyle basically flip the typical zombie formula to the other side, it emphasizes on survival and human emotions in an apocalyptic scenario. The zombies are just a backdrop, it could've been any other apocalyptic scenario.Though he chose to use zombies as the backdrop, and he did well in updating the zombie formula. They run, they're strong, there's a reasonable explanation of where they came from. It's filmed with a lot of mockamentary realism. But ultimately, the movie is a human story, not a horror movie. It doesn't provoke fear as often as a typical horror movie. Though when it does, it does it well.And for the human story involved, it's simply about a helpless boy who grew to face the enemy for the ones he loved and becoming a survivalist, and the girl who was a survivalist and learned to love and enjoy life again. It's very simple yet well-balanced.The romance is very convincing, unlike most Hollywood romance that feel tacked on and by-default. When Jim tried to kiss Selena the first time, it was obvious that he did out of desperation, loneliness and helplessness, not true affection. Selena rejected obviously because she saw that, and it didn't matter if she had any feelings towards Jim, she would refuse any emotional attachment to anyone regardless. By the end of the movie, they got together for good reasons, and we are all understand and appreciate how they got there.The low points: It felt like an 80-min movie stretched out too long. It feels like there's only 2 acts. As a human story, 4 characters are not enough to explore the wide range of emotions and interactions that exist in an apocalyptic scenario.Shortcomings aside, the movie feels fresh and original. Being a big Danny Boyle fan (ever since ""Shallow Grave"", before the ""Trainspotting"" phenomenon), this movie is a redeeming attempt to the disaster that was ""the Beach"". And I think he won my heart once again.If you are a typical horror movie fan, this is not the flick for you. You'll probably be disappointed.

773,BankBastard,Oh goodness...,5,1 July 2003,"*Some Spoilers* After seeing this movie, I felt betrayed by all the advertisements -""Scary as Hell"" being the first one that came to mind. It's not scary, it is a wee bit suspenseful and there are a few ""boo"" scares here and there. The actors are all somewhat bland and one-dimensional, and the transitions each one makes (tough to emotional, or weak to strong) were poorly handled and unlikely. Frank the father was the best character by far, followed by Major West. Selena wasn't bad either. Anyway, this movie is essentially a rip off of every other zombie movie I have ever seen. In particular ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead"". The whole evil hidden military agenda was straight from Day, as well as the idea of taking a zombie prisoner. The opening empty streets with newspapers giving Jim his clues was also directly lifted. The refueling station scene was very reminiscent of Dawn, I must say, especially with the child attacking the lead character in the office ... hmm. This movie is also  addled by too much artsy cinematography of scenic hillsides and horses, etc. A lot of the films action is based on stupid mistakes as well. Soldiers forgetting how to fight, people not taking guns, people hiding and waiting to get killed, people walking into dark rooms by themselves... silly cliché stuff. However, despite the plethora downfalls I was still somewhat amused. It should have been better, and it was frustrating to watch, but it was a decent movie.

The last 15/20 minutes  was just the usual 'let's fire some guns, blow stuff up and kill people' to get to the end. The story before that made up for it though.I was reminded just a bit of George R.

I was very intrigued. **POSSIBLE SPOILERS** The entire first half of the film I felt like I was watching a video game. It seems so contrived, the lead character walking around this abandoned city finding various clues as to what had happened. I could imagine exactly how the game would play out- read a notice on a kiosk, pick up some soda and some candy bars, meet some people that would fill in some of the pieces, then fight some creatures, collect some more supplies in an empty supermarket, etc, etc. Keep moving on, heading towards the army base,gathering more information along the way until the final climax when you have to save the women from the evil soldiers and the zombie creatures. I don't know if there is a game of this movie, but it seems to me it was created with that inevitability in mind. I feel like I've already played it. The game might be more interesting than the movie although I doubt it.As far as the ""alternate endings"" go, it just seemed to me that the filmmakers just did not have any idea of how to end this film. The ending that they settled on left me saying ""huh?"" and the alternate endings, including the ""radical alternate ending"" (which is just story boards)were just stupid. I guess I was waiting for something profound.There was basically no point to this movie. A couple of good moments that made me jump but I pretty much forgot about the movie as soon as it was over.

779,Dbt25677,Great movie.,9,23 September 2011,"This film is truly a great film. The occasional pop-up is sure to make you jolt in your seat. The whole film is very tense. This film is not full of gore, or blood or loud, terrifying music, found in a typical zombie movie. The thing that makes this film so scary is how empty it is. The occasional sign of life, e.g. a switched on TV, perhaps a phone with a cracked screen on the floor, and other such things which goes to show how devastating this movie's story is. Cillian Murphy a very effective actor and very well suited for this role.Great movie, one of the best I've seen in a while. Seriously, go watch this movie.",28 Days Later...

When you only see a handful of zombies in a country that has supposed to be taken over by these creatures, it is a little hard to swallow.  My suggestion, rent Dog Soldiers, it is the same movie, and is much more gory.  Hey pal, stick to Transpotting, you seem to be better at diving into the minds of sick kids, instead of just the sick.",28 Days Later...
782,userofthewheel,Great potential - not developed,6,23 November 2003,"I've always been a fan of this genre of movie so was really looking forward to this.  My review may contain SPOILERS.I was quite disappointed however for a number of reasons.  The film had great potential and a good story line but became unbelievable as soon as the characters reached Manchester.  Upon reaching Manchester they met a bunch of ""soldiers"" who represented a modern day English version of the Dirty Dozen with a typically eccentric CO.  Very stereotypical.  From here the film descended into farce.  The CO, played by Eccleston, had apparently lured our intrepid survivors to Manchester as he had promised his men ""some women"". We are now supposed to believe that British soldiers become sex crazed maniacs after about a month apparently.To add insult to this, the central characters had spent the first half of the film being extremely careful regarding catching the infection as a single drop of any bodily fluid can apparently infect.  In the finale however they are all running through a complete (infected) bloodbath of a house, in the dark, and yet none of them become infected. Incredible.Plot aside, other complaints I have are regarding the lack of music in the film. The film had the set pieces and the plot premise for great atmosphere yet they didn't capitalise on it with any music (think opening credits of Omega Man or Soylent Green for instance)  One of the characters who gets bumped off early on talks about the chaos at the rail station as people are trying to escape London yet we see no reconstruction or flashback of this or any of the other chaos associated with the virus.  A 5 minute montage of what actually happened after the lab break in would have been good.Also whenever there was an action scene involving the infected you couldn't actually see what was going on as it was all shot in a fast, flashy sort of camerawork which was really irritating - presume this is the digital some other reviewers have commented on.",28 Days Later...

This is where 28 Days excells... the acting is good, the camera work keeps you on the edge of your seat and instills a real panic.

784,TheFurious,Definitely Disappointing,3,24 January 2004,"After hearing a lot of praise for this movie, I finally got around to see it. I simply can´t understand how ´28 days later´ could be considered worth watching. In my opinion, the greatest flaw of this movie are the missing explanations. The holes in the story are just too big to be tolerated, vital information about the virus is not given away.The idea of all those empty cities is quite scary, but far from being new. The movie does have some ""authentic"" feel to it during the first 15 minutes, but I never really cared about the characters. Later on in that military camp, the whole story totally drifted away, became extremely unrealistic.
In a nutshell´: ´28 days later´ is mindless and redundant.",28 Days Later...
785,n-s-bondi,A terrible movie by a great director,3,24 February 2012,"I really can't see how people can actually say that the movie's ""one of the best of its genre"". It starts off okay and builds up a lot of tension throughout the first half of the movie, for example I found the encounter with the infected priest pretty good and the scene in which the ""zombies"" if you will, chase the main heroes up the stairway was kinda intense too, but nothing about it was really scaring me at any point and that is, in my opinion a K.O. argument for a horror movie, except maybe if the premise and overall plot is good. And in 28 Days later it isn't.To be fair, this is ""just"" a zombie movie and I can imagine that it is pretty hard to come up with an original, inspired plot for that genre, but in the first half of the movie, everything that happens you have seen in any shitty zombie movie before. I mean don't get me wrong - it's not a terrible story, but it's nothing special. It's just okay. And ""okay"" can sometimes be much worse than ""terrible"". Not only the story, but also the characters are very shallow. Literally no one in this film, I can recall having a personality and thus the very predictable romance isn't very captivating as well.But that all changes about 60 minutes into the movie, because then the movie decides to become a character study all of the sudden. And you know what? It failed and I might even go on and say that the second half is the worst part about the film and therefore ruins the entire movie. If you wanna see a character study of these people you could as well just study the social behavior of brooms during mating season.Another really big problem is the camera. Again in the first half it wasn't anything Oscar-worthy, but it never stood out in a negative way. Now in the second half either the cameraman had a seizure or (and that's the more likely theory) they just stopped giving a damn. It's even worse than in Quantum of Solace or Transformers. I just couldn't figure out what was going on on the screen.So if it hadn't been for the last 50 minutes I'd say give it a watch, but I literally have rarely seen a film that degrades so much the longer you're watching. If you want to watch a good recent zombie film you should check out Dawn of the Dead (2004), (REC), or 21 Weeks Later which is the much better sequel to 21 Days Later. So do yourself a favour and avoid this movie, it is not even worth the time opening the DVD case of it.",28 Days Later...
786,wiggie-5,"Frightening, Gross and Incredibly Fun!",8,13 May 2012,"28 Days Later (2002) has firmly secured its position as one of the greatest zombie films ever made. The film made it début back when the zombie franchise was at the height of its popularity, and rode the roller coaster of success. It's a superbly made film, and well deserving of its title as a modern classic.The film's protagonist, 'Jim' (Cillian Murphy), wakes up in an abandoned hospital with no knowledge of recent events. When examining the streets of London, Jim discovers that the city has been completely abandoned, or so it seems. Jim is soon attacked by people infected with 'the rage virus', a highly contagious disease that forces its host to go on a rage induced killing spree. Now, in the midst of a zombie apocalypse, Jim must work with other survivors in order to stay alive.What made 28 Days Later stand out from other zombie films was that it gave a scientific explanation for the zombie apocalypse. Most films, up until that point, had a supernatural explanation, or avoided an explanation all together. While earlier zombie films played on audience's fear of the supernatural and the unknown, 28 days later, plays on a more modern fear, the fear of disease. This modernising gives the film a sense of believability, while also making it more frightening than films before it.The zombies are more modernised themselves. These aren't the stereotypical zombies of past films, pale creatures who slowly stumble towards their prey. These zombies are fast, deadly and have the physical endurance that would rival an athletic sprinter. The virus is carried in the victim's blood, and if even a drop comes in close enough contact with you, then you have less than a minute until you become one of the 'infected'. The very idea of how vulnerable you are too infection is in itself a real life fear. This plays on the audience, making the film far more terrifying. Disease is the one enemy that you can't fight with conventional weapons.All the actors do a great job in this film, showcasing their characters and being very convincing in their roles.If you were expecting a movie where a bunch of survivors take charge with guns and start cutting down hoards of the infected, then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. You never even see a gun being fired until the last quarter of the film, and even then it's by members of the Army. 28 Days Later is more than your standard action flick, creating atmosphere and suspense through the use of timing, visuals and soundtrack. There's an uneasy quality about the whole film, making it great at what it's trying to do. There are a lot of shots in the film that have no music in them at all, giving an unnerving quality to scenes that were already unnerving to begin with.The film also makes use of 'shaky shots', particularly during suspenseful action scenes and when showing close-ups of the infected. This gives a sense of instability, like the audience is running alongside the characters, especially when the shots are taken at eye level. This technique also makes it difficult to get a good, proper look at the infected, giving a slight mystery to their full appearance. It also reflects the nature of the infected, as they have a tendency to twitch uncontrollably.There are few zombie films that can reach this standard of quality and horror. It has a lot of strengths and not many weaknesses. If you're a fan of zombie films or a fan of the horror genre in general, you need to see this movie!",28 Days Later...
787,peter_scott_best,I watched it because the CD was so bad,1,19 November 2004,"The Times gave away a 10 minute preview CD of this movie and what I saw on that was so awful I thought it was a joke. I went to see the movie and it was just as bad. Firstly in an NHS hospital the patients possessions are put in a bag that is put under patients trolley, but he can't find them. Next he smashes the plastic fascia of a Pepsi machine and gets a can out, but behind that fascia is a solid steel panel, there is no way to get a drink out. Later he sees Manchester off in the distances which is on fire. A fire that large (think Dresden in WWII) would create gale force winds and the smoke would not rise vertically as it does here. But best of all although a large city is in flames and producing smoke the sky is blue. If you like bad movies you can laugh at then try this one, but if you like your movies remotely believable then skip it.",28 Days Later...

To me this story was a horror story. But the movie itself isn't a simple horror movie. It's way better then a horror movie. It is a realistic view on what could happen if a frightening, deadly disease would break through. How people would react. How people would try to survive. Other movies that are as frightening as this one are 'Boys don't cry' (although complete other story. But even more realistic). This movie gets an 8 from me. Irreversible (again another story) my vote = 7. Gothika ( much worse movie) Gets a 4. The Ring (unrealistic story but really frightening) Gets a 5 from me. So beware, '28 days later' is a horror movie. So if you don't like to be scared, you better don't watch it.",28 Days Later...
789,floydian2018-1,Like all novelties...good to start with **Spoilers**,3,22 June 2005,"I finally got round to seeing this film after many many people had recommended it to me. I had always been a huge horror film fan and this was supposed to be one that matched up to previous horror genres. The premise that after animal activists uncage chimps which carry a disease called 'rage' (a bit too silly really, but all in all an interesting novelty) they infect the activists and thus go on the rampage through London leaving almost everyone zombiefied, the only people alive are seemingly a duo of zombie fighters and later on a husband and daughter who somehow have managed to evade all this. The scenes in London were good where it was totally deserted (apparently the scenes been shot in British Summer time in the early hours of morning) and the main character stumbled round trying to make sense of what had happened. But what doesn't bode well with me is the idea that of these few people alive, they don't feel almost ready to die, been the last people walking around and with no one and nothing to live for apart from each other. There is no moments of hysterical 'What do we have to live for?' really.By the time they got to the military part my eyes had begun to grow tired and was no longer concentrating on the film. It had bored me senseless. I had heard so much about this film but i am totally disappointed and dissatisfied with it.",28 Days Later...

792,yaoyuan,Disturbing,1,25 September 2005,"28 Days is by far the most violent/brutal movie that I have seen. Before I used to think movies such as Kill Bill I&II are brutal/exceedingly violent with their signature non-stop scenes of eye-ball gouging and samurai sword dicing human limbs like they are made of tofu and even Sin City! ...somehow this film manage to beat both of them and more. (It sort of reminds me of Dawn of the Dead remake, the most similar one I can think of right now. But Dawn was a classic straight forward horror, it did not leave deep impressions) I was so grossed out by 28 days =.="" but it's been a day that I watched it, I can't exactly translate my thoughts to words as to why that was the case though I suspect I was suffering from an overdose of sheer brutality. By the end my desire to analyze the symbolisms or metaphors whatever that some claimed was abundant became nil. The way the storyline was constructed--disturbing, the way the fight scene was constructed--disturbing. I do not like the ending and cannot sympathize with any of the main characters. Some spoilers: I had left the TV room with 2 scenes firmly attached to my head, one in the beginning when Frank was disposed (When i watched Hotel Rwanda, the main character said something to the effect of ""the machete is no way to die, I'd rather you take the kids and jump off the top of the building"" I concur with that)and the other near the end when some soldier died (or just paralyzed by shock?) because Jim managed to stuck his thumbs into his eye sockets and pressed....and pressed...(can you really die from that? I don't know but anyways...)The infected humans on the other hand are not scary since all they do is pretty much chasing after uninfected people, spitting blood and attacking victims with fists teeth and all but no tools off camera. The atmosphere didn't strike me as tense, it is almost carried out at a leisure pace until the final scene in the military mansion where we see Jim had come back with his own type of rage....Obviously this movie have done its job projecting its horrible images and mentality into me and perhaps some others. mission accomplished as a horror movie so much so it deserve a 10 but watching it had left me with such mental burden I'd rather give it a 10 in then negative direction and due to the fact that you cannot give negative ratings I gave it a 1. Be forewarned that this movie is twisted in the mental sense. Not a movie for everyone. I regretted watching it (coming from a person who had watched a good number of slashers/horrors)and feel like writing about it so some people interested can know what it's like before renting it or buying it etc.",28 Days Later...

It's not exactly a movie to enjoy but it did have moments where had more relaxing times like driving on roads next to beautiful fields of flowers and lush green fields with music that really suited the movie. The sections that did have violence/gore was not over stimulated like when the infected did not have to rip peoples bodies apart like in Dawn of the Dead etc. The actors except for Cillian were basically unknown but still didn't do a bad job in their parts. I won't reveal anymore but the Infected aren't their only problem and this extra problem made it more edge of the seat.

The infected was what made the characters develop during the film which was why it was better than many other zombie movies.The movie starts off quite slow but towards the end, you know that this is how people should be making zombie movies. The acting was great, the action was enjoyable and the music connected well to the scenes.The only things I felt were wrong was the fact that the quality was so bad, it was like the whole film was blurry. Another thing that annoyed me was sometimes there were camera angles where you couldn't quite see what was going on.But other than that, I guess you can say that this is an enjoyable post apocalyptic film that was fun to watch.",28 Days Later...

797,Kevbo,Seems to slow 'em down when ya shoot 'em in the head.,9,9 July 2003,"A great flick. Certainly it has its roots in such films as Omega Man, Dawn of the Dead (esp. + NOTLD & DofD), The Last Man on Earth etc. But I dare you to do a zombie movie without referencing, intentionally or otherwise, those seminal pieces. It seems to have been produced on a less-than-Hollywood size budget and that works very well for it. It's a little more personally involving that way instead of assaulting you with constant pullbacks, zoom-outs and flash cuts to reveal everything that could possibly blow up... being blown up. Another plus: The drama is not solely derived from the evasion by our heroes and heroines of the infected ""zombies."" The film is richer and arguably darker for making the clever decision to reveal the most threatening villain in the second half of the film to be just plain old uninfected humans... not the zombies after all. Can you trust the human next to you to kill you? Can you trust him to keep you alive? Are you better off amongst the bent-on-destruction, one-track-mind zombies or in claustrophobic quarters with uninfected humans of uncertain morals and questionable ethics? There is room for many stories based on this film's basic premise... all manner of confrontations with the dead and alive can be created here. Luckily for us, Danny Boyle focused on some of the most intriguing tales to share with us. I hope his future work is balanced out with more material of a horrific, dark nature.",28 Days Later...
798,Logicus,Missed opportunity,3,31 May 2003,"The idea of this movie is an ancient one. All people have been reduced to walking dead out to get the few survivors (i.e. non infected). Although that's always a good thing for a horror movie, every chance is missed in this script. I do not mind the story being implausible, but then give me some good horror (and don't pretend reality). The only good thing is the cinematography. I suspect that this was why the film was made. An emptied London looks very good. You could classify it as a comedy when the surviving British soldiers make it their top priority to get women after most of their countrymen are slayed. Unfortunately it is not a good drama (weak story), not a good horror (one eye poking after at least one hour), not a good sci-fi (impossible and illogical story). It creeps up to three out of ten points for the technical quality of the film making, but in my view it was a waste of time and money.

799,stormdude,The horrors of mankind,10,21 May 2003,"Truly gruesome and a must for anyone that likes seeing a rag-tag band of survivors fend off crazed, murderous, and highly infectious maniacs while exploring the true meaning of humanity!  Danny Boyle and Alex Garland nailed this genre perfectly.  While lacking somewhat the hip style of ""Trainspotting"" or ""The Beach"", it uses sound and digital camera work to create everything from haunting loneliness to sheer panic.  I found this film to be haunting and thought provoking.Although this movie appears to borrow heavily from Romero's pictures, I would say that this movie is distinctly different enough to stand on its own.  Boyle's movie seems to spend most of its time exploring the philosophical issues surrounding how Man lived and how they live in the face of this epidemic.  It appears what makes monsters so frightening are the traits that we see displayed almost daily from people all over the world. If anything, both ""28 Days Later"" and Romero's zombie movies are the direct product of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel ""I Am Legend"".  It would have been interesting to see Boyle take on `I Am Legend' (A disease turns everyone into vampires save one man.  The sole survivor spends his time hunting vampires and looking for a cure, but from the perspective of the vampires he is the monster - the movie `Omega Man' was a very poor adaptation).

But it is one hell of a movie. Not a gorefest, but a story, with real characters where everything doesn't have to explained to us (the way American movies do). Example? Most movies would go:Person1: They are infected with rage.Person2: What do you mean by rage?Person1: Well, sudden and extreme bouts of uncontrolled anger.Person2: Oh, I see. So because of this rage infection, they attack people then?Person1: Yes, that's right.Person2: I see.Etc. Sorry, but having seen the likes of Resident Evil, which *is* more high tech, but so awful to be untrue, it was a relief to watch a movie that didn't insult your intelligence, and gave it to you straight, with no hand-holding that is so prevalent in Hollywood movies today.The sense of loneliness and oppression were wonderfully done. Using DV only added to the 'feel' of the film in my opinion.Other points.1. I've read criticism on this board that society is unlikely to break down as fast, the soldiers would not be so brutal, would not lose all sense of moral responsibility so quickly. Er, boy are you in for a surprise when the electricity is off for more than a week with no hope of it being turned back on, coz your neighbour will be round with an axe to help himself to your larder, quicker than you can say ""I've got a family to feed."" And have you met your average trooper? He's a gun-toting, beer drinking, testosterone machine. He has needs, the same as every other man. He's got a gun, and knows how to use it. These men had been through hell, having to kill (perhaps hundreds or more) mad Manchurians fleeing from the burning city. The last thing they are going to be is balanced human beings.2. Killing someone by shoving their eyes through their brain. Ummm. I'm a bike courier and you are a trained soldier, versed in the martial arts. If I try to take you on using Marquis of Queensbury rules, I'm going to die. Not least because you've learned unarmed combat (and perhaps boxing!) and I have not. I'm not rational at this point and have to do anything, everything, to survive.I'd sure be tempted to take this route against a superior foe.Criticisms: The young girl's acting was appalling. Sorry. :-(
I felt the scene (post eyes through head) with Selena and Jim in the bathroom, Selena with machete in hand, was wasted. Selena would have been swinging that blade like her life depended on it.

806,komqul9646,spoilers unrevealed,6,9 August 2006,"This film is best when looked at as anti-apocalyptic. I heard people say this was anti-white. It talked about survival and culture clashes. Being blunt helps. People think situations like these are times to enact upon their darkest impulses. (i.e. Katrina tragedy) Victims are more than the zombies. It is the tale of misogyny justified. People spend more time thinking about themselves yet not on a global scale. I think this speaks to a current age of wartime and who are the real victims. Jim is a representative of the decent people who are oblivious to the dark side of human nature and when he finally awakes he becomes what he would have feared during his ordinary lifetime of being a normal law abiding citizen. What I mean to say is that he wasn't mentally ill, a road rager, etc. yet ironically he is the one blindsided in a car accident and it makes him realize the great and ultimately most damaging negative feeling in humanity is not despair but anger turned inward. I feel an objection however in the fact that selena and hannah were just used as props and archetypes. Selena starts out as a strong female/heroine yet ends up the victim so that Jim can uncover and unleash his animal nature to save her. It is a film that comes full circle I must say. A primate releases the infection borne of human rage and human anger leads to uncivilized animalistic behavior that saves Selena and Hannah in the end. However it is sad that the true ending would have been more poignant if Hannah and Selena internally and externally(verbally) confronted the despair of losing Jim and their families. In the end, the film is a film about irony and making allies in tough times. Also human nature is usually unpredictable in the worst and best circumstances.",28 Days Later...
807,neoraptor25,A deliciously gory study on human rage...,9,1 July 2003,"Just how big of a part of the human psyche is rage and violence? What is it that drives humans to be violent and aggressive? And even in the case of a powerful virus transforming everyone around into killing machines would all who survive pull together? Or would they continue to do what, in the end, appears to be encoded in our DNA? These are the topics which Danny Boyle is, i think, trying to comprehend with ""28 Days Later"". And he does so in a magnificent way; using DV, which is much more realistic and in a way more impressive than 35mm, Boyle follows Jim, Selena, Frank and Hannah in a desperate attempt to survive in a post-apocalyptic Britain. The shots of an abandoned London or the Englsih countryside are beautiful, if not utterly poetic. The talents of Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and of course Cristopher Eccleston and Brendan Gleeson add up to the film more than having a star cast. Plus there's John Murphy's exhilarating score, enhanced by musicians such as Brian Eno, Grandaddy and Blue States'""Season Song"". Any comparison to P.Anderson's mediocre ""Resident Evil"" is unfair and unreasonable; ""28 Days Later"" is not a nerveless, uninteresting, cliched ""Aliens"" wannabe; instead it's a fascinating but gory study on the very depths of the human psyche.8.5/10 rating.",28 Days Later...

I know it's not officially a 'zombie' movie but it brings enough freshness to the genre to really make it unpredictable and just plain cool. the only things I didn't like were on some of the action scenes it was a little hard to tell what was going on, but by the end you could figure it out. I've read complaints that the city should have been more destroyed, with bodies everywhere, but if you listen to the commentary, they talk about that and how they just didn't have the money to do it that way.danny boyle is a genius and I'm glad he decided to do a genre movie. even the fact it's shot on video adds to the creepiness, like you can't really see everything that's going on, and that makes it creepier, sort of like those old 70's horror movies shot on grainy 16mm where you had to peer into the picture to see what was happening..it really heightens the tension.I loved this movie.",28 Days Later...

All the actors are perfect (expect that one note little girl), the plot is unpredictable and with a powerful social message (note the name of the virus is called Rage, and is partly psychological).

810,giftakis,"Not a common horror movie, and not a very good one at that.",3,5 July 2003,"Well, some people liked this movie, either as a plain horror/thriller or some twisted, little sci-fi flick.I could read between the lines and saw the commentary on society's own cruelty, and how we can devolve to our baser states quite rapidly (whether you are an 'infected' or normal person).  Also, how the thin veneer of civilisation can be punctured by the smallest thing to show the truer side of man.But to advertise this movie as ""scary as hell"" or ""an unexpected terror"" or ""original and provocative""...I don't think so.I think I saw this movie before.  A handful of ""post-apocalyptic"" stories where survivors struggle to find *whatever*, and even in ""The Omega Man"" (Heston kicks some serious infected butt!).  So I can't call this movie original.I have a number of problems with the storyline, scenario, pace, and ending (I guess it had to have a happy ending...but did it?), but at least one thing makes up for all that--I'll never have to see it again. ...until they do a sequel, called [wait for it...] ""another 28 Days Later"", which will star Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy.

Horror/thriller movies are usually cheap, poorly-written and terribly over-acted.28 Days Later broke that sad, and often laughable, trend. This film is stylish and relatively thought-provoking, and though it does have some plot problems, I was able to overlook those. Normally, I cannot overlook plot holes or inconsistencies, but in 28 Days Later the problems were far outweighed by the intriguing writing, creepy cinematography and believable acting.I have a severe inability to suspend disbelief, but 28 Days Later was so unique I couldn't help but get caught up in the story. So ""Bravo!"" for not using A-list actors, not candy-coating the harsh post-apocalyptic setting, and most of all... ""Bravo!"" for creating a horror movie with style.",28 Days Later...

Why don't they just drive out into the country in a large industrial machine?  Why don't they go into one of London's many police station and grab their loud speaker equipment and call out for and organize other uninfected people.Finally, the uninfected, made no study of the infected.  Did they bite only once to spread the infection?,  Did they have any language skills?The only thing that kept me at all interested in the movie, was counting opportunity after opportunity missed by the uninfected to take simple measures to survive.I compare this movie to invasion of the body snatchers from the late 1950's where the uninfected learn the methodology of the disease, much more interesting.",28 Days Later...

820,BlowXL,The apocalypse is sponsored by... PEPSI,7,13 April 2011,"First of all: this is a nice movie and I would certainly recommend it. As sort of a British version of ""I am Legend"" it surpasses it's American counterpart by far. However, the amount of product placement in this movie is worse than in all James Bond movies combined. SPOILER ALERT! After the title of the movie appears on screen we see a guy waking up in a deserted hospital. The title implies he has been laying there for 28 days so he is understandably thirsty. Fortunetely for him there are dozens of PEPSI cans laying around in front of a PEPSI machine. This advertisement is by no means subliminal, but I hoped the director thought: let's get it over with in the first five minutes of the film. How wrong can one be. The guy, Jim, strolls out of the hospital onto the empty streets of London. It shows some beautiful images of all the famous landmarks completely deserted. The desolate feeling is intensified by a dramatic score, but when he picks up a newspaper in order to find out what has happened, we unfortunately see another can of PEPSI. He has his first encounter with zombie-like creatures (called ""the infected"") and is saved by two survivors who take him to their hide-out, filled with PEPSI cans and a big PEPSI poster on the wall. They team up to check out Jim's parents' house where the female lead Selena takes a PEPSI out of the cupboard, and when Jim can't climb a stair, Selena accredits it to lack of sugar, not just handing him a PEPSI but actually naming it. And this is just thirty minutes in! I understand filmmaking is a costly business, but there has to be a way of financing it without constantly showing PEPSI, Nescafe, Kellogs, The National Lottery, Heinz, Maltesers, PEPSI, Mars, PEPSI and PEPSI (just to name a few)",28 Days Later...
821,kerry99@hotmail.com,A lot can happen in 28 days! SPOILERS!!!,6,4 November 2002,"The start of the film:The opening scene with the activists setting free the monkeys served as a quick explanation of how the virus was started - however considering the monkeys were all ""infected with rage"" they seemed extremely placid! I think that this could have just been spoken about rather than having to see it - it didn't really add that much to the film - as it has been used loads of times before.Perhaps the opening would have been more powerful if it had begun with the guy, Jim, waking up in the hospital - that would have been far creepier! I thought this section of the film was fantastic - in an Open Your Eyes/Vanilla Sky kind of way. It was very great to see London so deserted! It might be possible to get a bit of shopping done! Obviously you'd have to kill a few zombies - but that's a small price to pay!I didn't think that the woman's character was believable at all - I thought that she was a real pain in the backside.Middle of the film:I liked the idea of meeting up with the guy and his daughter in the tower block - but surely with all the child actors in the world Danny Boyle could have found a better one that her! She was sooo wooden! Bless her!The taxi through the tunnel was good too - it was very tense.It was interesting to see their journey to find the soldiers they hear on the radio.End of the filmThe end seemed to be as if Alex Garland got fed up with it and went ""Oh I don't know they get rescued. Nobody will care anyway"".
Questions:1) Why didn't the zombies (Oh, sorry, ""infected with rage people"" eat each other? Why did they chase the non- zombies?2) I know men are supposed to be obsessed with sex, but bloody heel, they had only been in the house for just over a month! And they wanted to rape the women and start a new human race! Come on!3) Posh Captain said that they had covered the lawn with land mines - why on earth would he send his men out to ""clean up the bodies'!4) If one little tiny of drop can turn you into a zombie if it gets in your blood don't you think it'd be a bit risky having the ""Gimp"" zombie in the back yard! He was spewing up blood an inch from were they where!5) Even when the soldiers blew up the zombies on the fence and blood and good went everywhere not one drop of blood went on them!CinematographyI don' think that MiniDV is good enough to hold up at the cinema.  I know that one of the reasons it was chosen was probably because it is supposed to look more ""real"" but it doesn't seem to give that effect. John Carpenter's films from the seventies, like Assault on Precinct 13 or Escape from New York look a bit ""cheapo"" but not in the same way as this film. It makes the movie look a student's end of year project.
SoundtrackI thought that the soundtrack was awful!  The version of ""abide with me"" was so pretentious! And that music in the supermarket! Did the director get one of his mates with a Bontempi Organ to write it! Or was it one of those free music sample CDROMs you get!Overall CommentsI think that the film was okay. I think it would have been a million times better it was filmed on 35MM, with a completely new soundtrack, better actors (except for the main guy), a better ending, better editing and a new ending.And WHY OH WHY didn't that woman kill Jim with Machete when she thought he was a zombie?

822,LightArchy,21st Century Horror,10,16 July 2003,"This is Danny Boyle's finest work since Shallow Grave.Despite what might be considered its shortcomings - 28 Days is shot on video, its production value leaving something to be desired, a couple of plot twists are somewhat muddy, and there is that pesky accent thing - which makes us, Americans, have to watch it time and again (darn!) - this film stands head and shoulders above not only Boyle's recent work, but most Hollywood summer blockbusters as well.Heavily reminiscent of all three Night of the Living Dead movies, 28 Days Later single-handedly evolves the genre to the next level.  This is humanity in the 21st century - no more retarded characters, no screaming ""don't go in there!"" at the screen, and, to be sure, it is scary as hell.Being a girl, I would be remiss if I didn't mention all the cute boys - Christopher Eccleston is always terrific, even if he is totally unappreciated in Hollywood, and the lead, Cillian Murphy, is not only hot, he can act, too.Brendan Gleeson's career speaks for itself - Tailor of Panama, The General, and Butcher Boy are some definite highlights, and both the girls, Naomie Harris, and Megan Burns are wonderfully real.Technically, 28 Days Later is, quite possibly, the first film ever to transcend the visual limitations of DV, via its powerful story-telling and Brian Eno's strong musical score.  Though, I did shed a tear for all those gorgeous shots of London not being in widescreen 35mm.It's testament enough that 28 Days Later can hold its own against Hollywood's big guns - it made its budget back during the first weekend!",28 Days Later...

Being a movie after all, it isn't long before the army enters the picture. But Major West (Christopher Eccleston), who takes the trio under his wing (whoops-notice I don't say foursome!) motives aren't as kind as you'd think initially.28 Days Later, directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) and written by Alex Garland (The Beach), is a fast paced, excellent action thriller which details the catastrophic effects rage has on people and society all together. You can't help but think ""Could this really happen?"", considering Rage is a more realistic threat then zombies. The acting is good, and some scenes are even slightly humorous, such as when Jim sets off a car alarm in London.So, in conclusion, 28 Days Later is worth watching. A brilliant movie, roasted and served with potatoes on the side. So, if you haven't seen it, you should rent it. You won't be sorry.",28 Days Later...

She had the whole London at her dissposal, but until that momment she had conformed with cokes 'rich on sugar'... - For the whole movie, you watch how the virus is so easy to infect (see Frank´s death).

This is exactly what happens when one has a great plot in hand and does a sloppy execution of it.However, the actors are definitely the saving grace for the movie. Great performance from him as always. And Boyle definitely knows how to direct.Agreed that the movie has a chilling storyline, but there are far too many flaws and mistakes around. In fact even a single watch is sufficient to spot some of them! And the worst part of it is after making such a great start to the movie, the director just seems to lose it all thereafter.

I'm glad that I kept to my policy, with 28 Days Later. This was a solid film that I enjoyed watching, because of the script's logical course. I definitely recommend seeing it with a similar lack of expectations.Now for the nit-picking. I did go in expecting to see a horror film, as advertised. I did not, but I did see a film that is somewhat difficult to categorize. Keep that in mind, as you go to see Danny Boyle's latest directing venture. The directing was wonderful, by the way. Also, there are quite a few artistically incredible shots you have to see on the 'big screen'. However, this film will leave you with a lot of questions. Perhaps, the original script was slim or something happened in the editing process. The bottom line is that this film seems to substitute explanation for action. Now, I don't like too much explanation in movies. I'm smart enough to figure things out, but I'm not psychic. 'What do you mean rage?' may be one of the questions you leave with. I'm not going to give much (if any) of the story away, but they could have thrown some more bones to the audience. Maybe, it was the writer's and/or editors' intent to leave these holes to the viewer's imagination to fill. The seeds could have been bigger or led to more complex solutions, though. You'll know what I'm talking about, when you see it. Aside from lack of any decent explanation in the film, I really did enjoy watching it and the ending is more-or-less open ended.

831,bailoutboy87,Boyle stole $7.50,1,28 June 2003,"This movie is yet another case where it takes a beat-down plot, and starts out a movie with something seemingly interesting.  Zombie movies aren't original, but nothing really is, technically.  The first 10 minutes of the movie rocked, with the mysterious ""rioting"" scenes and the whole monkey-setting-free scenes.  It made me think that this movie would actually be good.  I nearly shat my pants though, after the whole cool monkey-infection part, the very first thing you see is Jim's [the main character] penis.  It's a good 5 minutes of penis too.  It was really really awful.  Then he had to rub it in by showing everyone his naked butt for another 5 minutes.  He starts wandering around town, and the movie stops being good after the first song stops playing.  After the dramatic bridge [the drum part] with Jim looking at the wall with ads of dead people, the movie turns into a living crap machine.  The movie switches genres a good three times throughout the movie, starting out as a kind of cool zombie movie, switching into a hippie hitchhiker movie, into a gay-bashing fest [where everyone makes fun of the fairy that cooks in the military camp]. The middle hour and 45 minutes of the movie is a blur, with highly predictable plot ""twists"" and ""edge of seat"" suspense sequences.  To top everything off, though, the movie ends in a vague fashion, completely confusing anyone who was unfortunate enough to spend two hours in this bore-fest.  Keep in mind, this is just my opinion, and I'm no expert by any means, but this is truly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, managing to beat out ""Darkness Falls"" and the god-awful ""Legally Blonde"".

This movie takes zombies to a whole new direction. The plot anyway works well. It leaves some loose ends but that allows the viewer to imagine what happened like how the virus spread and such.

838,filmex2000,A Ghastly Success,8,7 July 2003,"This zombie film is a fun little thriller, and is one of the first zombie films in a long time not to play things for laughs. While hilarious films such as RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD and BRAIN DEAD aka DEAD ALIVE certainly have their place, the trend of going for dark humor with the unstated belief that the genre was otherwise played out is aptly refuted by this no-nonsense film.While tipping its hat to classic horror/post-Apocalyptic films such as DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS and THE WORLD, THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL (not to mention the Romero trilogy), the film is also a distinguished benchmark in horror cinema as the first important post-9/11 fright fest. The film is amazingly prescient in that, although it was actually filmed during the summer prior to 9/11, it so accurately encompasses so many of the fears that traumatic event let loose.It is impossible to look at the masses of photos of missing loved ones on the walls in abandoned London in this film and not be reminded of the same in the days following the World Trade Center disaster. The viral plague that is let loose on England in this film is horrifying in many other ways.
Not only is the thought of any nation as an island susceptible to a virus capable of turning humans into mad, flesh-consuming beasts horrifying in and of itself, this film works on other levels. In that the world we currently live in is one of spooky nightly news telecasts of SARS and monkey pox and seemingly new endless contagions, it is impressive how far out ahead of the curve the production of this film was.Also, the reconstruction of the zombie mythology whereby rather than being slow, lumbering living dead, these zombies actually move about like sprinters, sometimes merely being seen as a blur, is a radical departure from what we are used to and all the more horrifying for it.
Finally, it is also incredibly heartening that Danny Boyle has recaptured his roots as viewed in SHALLOW GRAVE and hopefully forsaken crass blockbuster projects such as THE BEACH.",28 Days Later...

842,daxjim,Lack of originality,6,22 July 2003,Let me first say that I wasn´t disappointed by this film as I had already read the comments of other users on this site before going to see it; so I knew what to expect. It seems to me however that most people posting here are getting hung up about plot irregularities and inconsistencies when for me the real problem with this movie was the total lack of originality. If you are a real fan of the genre then you will have seen this movie before in at least one other incarnation. It´s basically dawn of the dead (shopping spree in particular) mixed with elements plagiarised from the day of the Triffids (guy wakes up in hospital to find a deserted city)and other similar films. In short I thought the technical aspects of the movie were very good; I really enjoyed the cinematography but the plot needed something to differentiate it from other similar movies. Any comments??,28 Days Later...

846,bradpenn,interesting take on 'zombie' movies,8,1 April 2004,"***spoilers*** This absolutely has to be the most well thought out zombie movie that I have ever seen.  It starts out in a fairly typical fashion: virus spreads and completely eliminates pretty much everyone except for a few who struggle to stay alive without a shred of actual hope (although the idea of Jim waking up without a clue is an interesting way to add some suspense/scariness to the beginning by focusing on the desolation and devastation of the disease before introducing too much gore). As with many zombie movies there are some really funny parts (I especially like when Jim hits the priest who is trying to eat him and then profusely apologizes while running away). However, what makes this movie really interesting, and sets it apart from many other movies of the same genre, is the seed of hope that exists due to the disease only spreading on an island rather than definitely affecting the whole earth.  Where other movies of this sort force the protagonists into a fairly absurd struggle for mere living, there is always the possibility that the rest of the world is not infected (realized by Jim while talking to the sergeant and when he is about to completely give up hope and he sees the plane overhead).  It is this ability for hope/heroism, while still maintaining the humor and gore of a typical b-movie that make this particular film so interesting to watch. Also, the segues between shots of the sky (where you can see the next shot in the upper left corner) fit really well with the movie and was quite brilliant.  If you hate every zombie movie you've ever seen and aren't much for horror, odds are you will dislike this movie.  However, if you've always been vaguely fascinated by zombie movies this is a truly innovative one.",28 Days Later...
847,Sugarmonster,Remake of a sci-fi classic,4,7 October 2007,"It wasn't a bad film, I guess, as zombie-slasher flicks go... but the reason I don't rate it is because unlike most of that genre it claimed to have a plot. And the plot they used was not original - so from the opening scene I knew where it was going and just waited for it to get there. There were some nicely done moments but I wasn't ""on the edge of my seat"" because I pretty much knew what was going to happen next.*** SPOILER *** Go to a bookstore and find a book called ""Day of the triffids"" by John Wyndham. Then read it and map the scenes to 28DL. The reason this is a spoiler is because if you've read the book, you've seen the film!

851,pgoochuk,A game of two halves; from the sublime to the ridiculous,6,21 December 2005,"'28 Days Later' could have been a Great British Horror Film. The first 45 minutes is packed with some of the most haunting and fantastic horror imagery filmed on UK shores since The Wicker Man and Witchfinder General. It is packed with brilliant compositions, such as the dead and infected lying scattered in the church, both illuminated by and mirroring the imagery in the stained glass window; Jim wandering a desolate Leicester Square in his pyjamas; the overturned red bus in a deserted street. Unfortunately, the first warning note is sounded when Hannah (Megan Burns) is given some dialogue. What is is with British child actors these days? And once the survivors reach the military base, the film descends into Carry On territory. While the first half was plausible, the rest will have you in stitches with its unintentional hilarity. Listen to incredible Alien 3-style 'wanker' and 'bollocks' cockney banter. Watch apparently highly trained British soldiers panic at the first sign of trouble. See a naked and untrained bicycle courier take out a 9 armed squaddies with his bare hands. Shake your head in disbelief as Jim survives a rifle-shot to the abdomen at point blank range without medical attention.But do see this film, and think about what might have been, had someone reigned in Alex Garland's frustrated fantasies.",28 Days Later...
852,movie_person,28 Days Later,7,12 March 2005,"This, I have to say, was one of the better viral-zombie films I have seen. The plot was highly un-original, but extremely well made. The acting was powerfully preformed, the filming having many ""diagonally tilted camera view"" scenes, giving off more suspense, without the reliance on the overly used ""scary music"". Also, the addition of the alternate ending gave a strong closing to the film. This is the kind of movie that you end up feeling physically drained after seeing your first time. It will suck you in until the end, every time. I seriously recommend seeing this if you enjoy zombie films, you will not be disappointed.",28 Days Later...
853,Strayer,Different from other zombie flicks,10,25 June 2005,"28 Days Later is, in a way, like your usual horror flick. Disease, in this case Rage, gets out and wipes out many many people. We see the main character, Jim, wake up in a hospital and wander around the now abandoned London as he searches for any sign of civilisation. He then meets the infected, people who have Rage, who chase him and try to kill him. Rage will make you a merciless blood-hungry beast. Jim soon meets Selena and Mark, two survivors who hide in a deserted shop. Jim begins to panic and after hearing that there is no government, he says a line which really makes you think: ""What do you mean there's no government? There's always a government, they're in a bunker or a plane somewhere!""However we know he's wrong. This movie shows, in my opinion, that everyone is truly equal. The government and military aren't stronger than the average person. Unlike other movies the government doesn't escape from the virus in this one. Almost no one can.When the survivors meet Frank and his daughter Hannah. They then come up with a plan: to follow the directions a Major Henry West has given over the radio. As they arrive, they soon discover the daunting secret the nine soldiers keep.After seeing 28 Days Later, I began to think of most of the other zombie flicks I had seen before. Many rely on gory and sickening scenes with rotting flesh and lots of blood, as well as lots of screams and surprise moments. 28 Days Later doesn't rely on these facts. Unlike most zombie movies, there are some peaceful moments.The cinematography is excellent, with the abandoned streets and buildings. The characters also aren't two dimensional people who do the same thing over and over again. These people really seem like they have lost their families, they grow and develop, they express their feelings and they realise what they've got right and what they've got wrong.The horror scenes are well made with the infected people acting like what a real zombie would be like in my mind. They run, gurgle, scream and swing around their arms. I don't exactly like the traditional disheveled zombie which walks around and moans a lot. So this was a nice change of pace.One of my favourite scenes is the shopping scene. It's a beautiful happy part where the characters seem to forget their troubles as they take some the food. The music sets the scene perfectly. We even see them bond during their little spree. This part made me truly smile.All in all, this is a good movie for people who either a) are just starting to watch zombie flicks or b) just want to watch a great movie.",28 Days Later...
854,razorpetti37,Has more loop holes than an amusement park,3,22 May 2005,"This movie is mildly entertaining but there are a ridiculous amount of loop holes. In fact, there are so many that it becomes distracting while viewing the film. This is quite disappointing because the idea of the film has so much more potential, although it is an idea that has remarkable similarities to about 20 other zombie type flicks. First i'll start off with what i liked, then i will continue with a list of loopholes and other points that ruin this movie.-The lab scene at the beginning is a decent introduction. I like this explanation of where the virus came from considering real life viruses such as AIDs supposedly came from chimps. I also found it a much more believable reason for a apocalypse type virus than in other movies, at least the virus didn't come in an asteroid or something. I found ""Dawn of the Dead"" to be quite similar to this movie in so many ways but in ""Dawn of the Dead"", they don't give you an explanation of where the virus came from. I also liked how there is a little more to the story than just fighting off zombies. Actually, most of the movie doesn't even involve fighting off zombies, most of it is them just talking (which makes the movie kind of boring at times).*Now for the parts that make this movie horrible* -So he wakes up in the hospital and is the only one there? For one, why would there not be other patients who couldn't leave such as the disabled, secondly, if the hospital was evacuated, why would they just leave him there.-If there was no one there to fill his feeding tubes and stuff, why wouldn't he have died in his sleep -If there is no power in the city, why is the grocery store all lit up inside, especially if there is no one to continue running the power plants.-So your telling me that with a disaster such as an exodus from Britian, that there were no riots or panicking and nobody tried raiding stores. The food is perfectly stacked and nothing seems to be missing in the grocery store. I would think at least somebody would have gone in there to grab some supplies.-If these infected people are so vicious and all they do is blood lust, then why do they not attack each other. That makes absolutely no sense.-How come the infected are never seen unless the characters are vulnerable? They always show up in hordes yet while looking over the city, you never see them wandering in the streets. At least in ""Dawn of the Dead"" there were masses of zombies everywhere, which made sense if the population was supposed to be infected.-Apparently a rickety piece of junk taxi can drive like a monster truck over wrecked cars in the tunnel. Why does that make sense? And all they get is a flat.-Considering the city is supposed to be abandoned besides those who are infected, you would think there would be a lot more parked cars, wrecked cars, and other common city street objects.-So if the infected are supposed to be vicious and killing machines, then why are there no corpses on the streets? Besides the loft in the church, there were a total of like 10 corpses in the whole movie.-If the infected kill because they have ""rage"" and not for eating the people, then what do they eat to survive. You never see them eating anyone, so you'd think that after 28 days of not eating anything, they would have died. If they don't eat their victims, what are they eating since the grocery stores are intact.-When they are filling up with gas, i find it very curious that even though they know not to go anywhere alone, Jim decides to go wandering into a dark shack by himself for absolutely no reason. Big surprise that there's an infected person in there...-So these military guys have this secure base set up and apparently nobody but they survived the move from the previous base. At the barricade there were parked cars and stuff implying that there were civilians that came yet there are none with the leftover military men.-You think that trained military men would be able able to find a slightly more secure place to make a base. If they planned on surviving there for a long time, i think it would make sense to find a place more easily defend-able.-This is what really doesn't make sense: If these military guys have the radios to send out a strong broadcast, then why would they not be able to pick up transmissions from other countries that are not infected? -If there are other countries that are not infected, then why would none of them be concerned with finding survivors in Britain. If they do this at the end by flying over the country side with a jet, then why would the military guys never see a plane that would give them hope that the rest of the world is OK.-Apparently a scrawny bike carrier can undermine 8 or 9 trained military personnel. He somehow gets back onto the property unnoticed (which nobody has been able to do yet), then he sneaks around the property like some sort of ninja, then moves throughout the house without running into any of the military guys or any of the infected military guys. Why is he so skilled all of a sudden.That about covers all the loopholes i can think of. I'm sure there are many more but that just goes to show how ridiculous this movie is. I'm normally not so picky about movies but this one just bugs me.",28 Days Later...

856,florisgek,NOT a Zombie movie,10,27 November 2005,"First off, let's make clear I really liked this movie: Great story, great actors, well-paced and some very nifty director's tricks make this a very enjoyable flick. What drives me off the wall, and at the risk of being labeled a nitpicker (which I am) is the fact that this movie gets mentioned whenever the topic turns to ""good, bad, or so-so Zombie movies"". There Is Not, repeat NOT A Single Zombie in 28 Days!!!! True, they LOOK like Zombies, they ACT like Zombies, they SOUND like Zombies, but they're not dead! They've all been infected with this ""Rage"" virus thingie. So all they want to do is kill people. Even eating is not on their to-do-lists anymore. Or washing, or going number two, for that matter(oh, the humanity..). I thought this was a brilliant idea, totally original and handily used-If the survivors just wait it out for 4 weeks (28 days again!), the maximum period of time the human body can survive without food, the Ragers will just..die! Ever see a Zombie starve to death, hmm? Well, at the end you see some poor ragers collapsed from starvation, out on the road. For me, that was one of the (many) great perks of this movie: Original Content! Let's not insult it by lumping it under the wrong header! If this movie is to be compared, it should be Cronenberg's Rabid ('77)."" Are you sure this is the Sci-Fi convention? It's full of nerds!"" Homer Simpson",28 Days Later...
857,sdoell,One of the best films of the genre,9,11 January 2008,"Not since the original 1978 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" have I seen such a fine movie for this genre. The cast of lesser-known actors shows that great films don't need star power to succeed. I was completely drawn into the story and unlike most other films didn't find myself guessing when the hero was going to save the day. The plot development doesn't rely on the formulaic buildup of the hero but instead concentrates on the harsh cold realities of such an outbreak. It carries the film and makes it easy to sustain your disbelief as the story unfolds. This is the kind of film, like ""Trainspotting"", also a UK film, that defies the homogenized Hollywood motion picture machine concept. In short, another great film from the UK. I highly recommend it. Also, don't forget to watch the sequel ""28 Weeks later"" which is almost as good and stars Robert Carlyle.",28 Days Later...

I've seen worse though particularly from the US.,1,18 March 2006,"Sorry, but despite the fact that this film contains one or two good performances, Christopher Eccelstone for one, I find it a very poor copy of a well worn and very juvenile plot. The low budget is pretty obvious, the poor quality special effects as far as the scenery is concerned stand out a mile. I felt embarrassed that this was billed as a British production. We have done far far better than this in the effects dept.If this had been a TV movie I would have given it a slightly higher rating. In fact a very similar TV movie was made by the BBC many years ago with far better performances too. The over acting particularly by Cillian Murphy and the two girls was pathetic to watch, and in some cases just downright ridiculous and totally unconvincing, whatever makes these 3 think they're actors?, and the plot was so full of holes it does'nt bear mentioning.",28 Days Later...

It isn't a 3 hour mind-bending Nolan movie but it isn't a dumb zombie survival horror endlessly filled with jumpscares, gore, and man-on-zombie action (although it obviously contains all of the above as one would expect from a zombie movie). This movie actually presents interesting themes, although the characters may be a bit simple they are as real as it gets. There are multiple thought provoking ideas scattered along the characters journey some were just hinted at some were expanded upon but not too much as the main focus was on the clean storyline and the characters that at points left me gripping the edge of my seat and sometimes the feels caught me off guard. It's beautiful blend of everything a movie like this needs and for me the filmmakers just hit the right proportions of those ingredients.",28 Days Later...
861,jamesabutler-1,Truly Frightening!,10,5 June 2006,"28 Days Later effectively does what a film of it's genre should do - scare the crap out of you! What makes is so effective is that it takes place in surroundings that are familiar - Downtown London, surrounding suburban towns. Just the thought of something like ""rage"" actually happening is very terrifying. I think it's also good that no big name stars are in the film. Sometimes big names can be a distraction. With all the talk about avian flu, and other pandemics, rage doesn't seem to far fetched. That in itself, makes this film frightening, indeed. You could imagine this scenario taking place anywhere in the world. However, London seems the most plausible due to the fact that it is the capital city of an island.

865,midnightbluesophie,An extraordinary experience that I highly recommend,9,5 February 2019,"Initially I thought this was a zombie/ horror movie and I do not normally watch these. But as it turned out, it is not technically a zombie movie and even if it is edging towards that, it is so much more than that and I am glad now to have it in my collection.While of course you can watch it purely as entertainment or a warning about how easily a pandemic or other events can upset everything we take for granted, it contains a much more universal truth which makes this movie so special to me.(spoilers ahead)
At the beginning of the film we see the main character of Jim (who is played by the superbly talented Cillian Murphy) lost, alone and feeling depressed. What he is looking for throughout the movie is something we consciously or subconsciously all chase: reaching an inner serenity, a feeling of coming home, where we feel secure, peaceful, to belong somewhere. Although this is primarily something inside us, we often tend to seek it mainly on the outside. We think: when I complete this job, get this house or this partner, I will finally be able to relax and be happy. But by doing so, we make our happiness dependant on things that are subject to frequent change. Whenever we seem to reach satisfaction, it slips out of our hands again. In the film it becomes even more apparent, as the apocalyptic setting finally makes it impossible to seek stability on the outside.
Whenever Jim finds a father figure or a place of rest, something happens and he has to move on or flee again. Near the end of the film, when there is no prospect of help and there is nowhere left to go, he finds that quality in himself, he steps up to protect Selina and outwits the soldiers. And in the moment where he has found that in himself, it manifests on the outside, in the love of Selena and the peaceful spot in the countryside. That is why I am so glad they went with the ending of the film that they did. The last shot of Jim looking so calm, confident and optimistic and no longer depressed brought it full circle for me.",28 Days Later...

867,BadNewsCrewse,This is NOT a zombie flick! (maybe minor spoilers),3,28 June 2003,"I want to clear the air first off by saying that this is NOT a zombie flick. Zombies, as a general rule since Romero's ""NOTLD"", have acted in certain ways. They have ONE main goal which is to feed. They aren't in a murderous state of rage out to kill... they just want to eat. They also were people who died in whatever way they died and shortly thereafter became the undead. They also move very slowly and are clumsy to an extent. The general moan and groan is their basic vocabulary. In this movie which has been stated as a zombie flick, the so called zombies are nothing of the sort. They want to do nothing but KILL. They aren't interested in a meal. They are not people who have recently died, but they are people who within 10-20 seconds get infected with the virus through a scratch, a bite, or somehow getting the infected blood into their system which in turn puts them into a state of murderous rage. They can run and jump very proficiently. They also scream as well as moan. I can't understand where people say this is a zombie movie. If you are reading this and haven't seen it yet, do not expect it to be one. I was told that it was and read that it was and was gravely misled. It has some cool moments in the film, but I was not impressed. I also didn't like that every time an ""infected"" would be shown, the screen would move so much that you couldn't really even tell what was happening. Actually that happened when any action was taking place. I would recommend to you that if you want to see a zombie movie, go rent ""Dawn of the Dead"" or if you want to see a movie with an outbreak in it, rent ""Outbreak"".",28 Days Later...
868,Karnevil-2,Humans vs. Civilization,9,21 May 2004,"*****WARNING: Spoilers appear throughout the following commentary*****The infection is called Rage. Do they mean Rage as in the human emotion, or R.A.G.E. as some kind of acronym? (I.E. government experiment gone awry.)Those infected with ""rage"" are not really walking dead (thus the unfair comparisons, imho, to the Living Dead movies) - they are mortal. Although it is evident that the infected die from starvation, they don't ever appear to be feeding on humans, only either quickly passing the infection on, or quickly killing their prey off.On one level, the infection is less the dilemma in this film - almost like a side-note. The real problem lies in how the uninfected react.The military was chosen very intentionally for this film to represent an institution of civilization. Major West demonstrates to Jim how well his soldiers have kept themselves organized; how civilized they have all remained with a boiler for hot showers and a fancy dining room in which to eat meals.Yet West is not the noble officer he appears to be. He sits on a richly upholstered chair from the mansion his team has helped themselves to, and surveys his domain like a king. During the ""toast"" at dinner, he helps himself first to the meal (what kind of officer feeds himself before his soldiers have been fed?) During the attack, he remains seated at the table to finish his meal. He later informs Jim that he promised women - now meaning Selena and Hannah - to his troops (not that the promise was his to make in the first place.)Even when we all have a common enemy, we still cannot get along and make ends meet. At the end of the film, the look of startled confusion on Jim's face in response to Selena asking him if the pilot had seen them this time seems to ask, ""Does it really matter? Because what are we being save from, and where are we being saved to?""********End of Spoilers**********28 Days Later does a fantastic job of showing how civilization does not come from without - it does not come from luxuries, riches, or ownership. It comes from within - our acceptance of the responsibility to ""maintain"" no matter what. And it also challenges us to look at our own recognized institutions of civilization: have we built them upon false premises?This movie will be enjoyed by readers of ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Heart of Darkness"". Chris Eccleston is subtly excellent as the manipulative, yet still complex, Major West. Cillian Murphy, who plays Jim, possesses an amazing array of body language and facial expressions that augment not just his own character, but the general themes of the movie.",28 Days Later...
869,twgame,Not a Zombie Movie!,8,13 July 2003,"First, let me say I think this is a terrific film. I haven't been so on-edge in a theatre in quite some time, at least for the first 2/3 of the story. Once they get to the military outpost it loses its steam, I think.Several images and scenes remain in my mind though, like when the guy is walking through his old house with candle in hand and you see the outside POV and the thing starts rushing him. Cool. Also liked how he first saw the jet flying overhead. Loved the look of the film as well.However, I don't think the ""things"" in the film are ZOMBIES. A Zombie is a dead person who is brought back to life. That does not happen in this film. These things are infected. Once you kill them, they're dead. So if you're bit by one, sure you'll be infected too, but if a thing KILLS you, you're dead, end of story- no ZOMBIES.A crucial and distinct difference.",28 Days Later...
870,Rupert64,Absorbing,7,9 November 2002,"While this is not a perfect film, I came away from the cinema feeling I had seen something new, worthwhile, thrilling and innovative.New in the sense it was not a traditional or modern zombie film, in fact it seems to borrow more from the Crazies and the Omega Man rather than Romero's classics (although there are some obvious homage to them as well)Worthwhile in the sense that the characters were developed more, especially in the first half of the film and the desolation and isolationist feel was well communicated.  Also the film took a brave leap in the second half that some have disliked.  Certainly I felt this was an interesting direction more reminisent of Apocalypse Now than the usual zombie flick and introduced new character elements with new messages.Innovative, certainly was the digital aspect of the film, the graininess working very well, contributing to the atmosphere and the realism. This was for mind the most impressive achievement.On the other side the infected are monsterous and the vision bleak. Recommended and throughly enjoyed. 8/10",28 Days Later...

In 112 minutes, writer Alex Garland manages to take his characters on an epic journey through post-Apocalyptic England.The characters begin the movie as survivors doing only what is necessary to keep themselves alive, but by the end of the second act the characters have become much more. With the zombies taking a backseat, the characters drive the story and draw the viewer in.Without rehashing the typical zombie story or spoon-feeding us trite, established, Hollywood archetypes, Danny Boyle's direction, Alex Garland's script, and John Murphy's score have made this the best film of the year.",28 Days Later...

This movie is shot in a style which leads the viewer to believe that things truly are as messed up as they are attempting to portray them. While it is not the scariest movie I have ever seem, it was definitely thought-provoking. My wife and I discussed the implications for some time afterward and agreed that this movie was so much more entertaining than Matrix-Reloaded. The fact that I was not ready for this movie to end, but was satisfied by the way the storyline was tied up, is a testament to the outstanding character development that takes place as the movie progresses. This is the first movie I have seen in a while where I actually cared for the main characters.Sauce",28 Days Later...
873,elusive kudo,"Could have been the GREATEST HORROR EVER - but sadly, it is NOT",9,7 July 2003,"** This commentary is full of SPOILERS **""28 Days Later"" was unbelievably great movie for the first hour or so. The only weak hole I personally saw, was the lack of explanation to why ""Jim & Selena"", instead of having only baseball bats and half-machetes, could not simply walk into the first police station and arm themselves to their ""teeth""?  Having said that, the scary premise, the tactics, the acting, the plot, the end-of-the-world feeling was pretty frightening and thrilling in that first  3 1/4 of the movie. BUT, then the filmmakers yielded away from those great ""winning"" ways which were evident in the first hour or so,  just to engage us with this dumb sub-plot of ""Jim the hero"" trying to rescue the two women he barely knows, from their uncomfortable, but surely logical  ""breeding machines"" - destiny.Now, why in the hell would ""Jim"" ever do that? I mean, how logical is that in the face of sheer terror, man-versus-man type of mentality, and against the overwhelming odds - ""Jim"" is turning against the soldiers who happened to be the only source of protection these three have, just to engage in ""Ramboisation"" and save the women from their own protectors - even more especially when is known to us that ""Selena"" would have no sentiments of killing ""Jim"" if the need arised.And also, why did soldiers have that ""infected"" alive in their garden to begin with? One would think that they would do anything to destroy the infected a.s.a.p., and not risk their own well being by having an ""infected"" full of powerful rage chained in their midst? (by the way, how did they succeeded in chaining the ""infected""??) And finally, THE ENDING. For chris' sake, that was lame. Why do they always have to have stupid, ""happy"" ending is unbeknown to me? It's a FICTION movie for god's sake, so make it end in the most powerful way you can. I mean you're making a horror drama full of doomed feeling, and than you end it with ""happy, happy"". It's like p***ing all over your work thus far. I mean, at least make a compromise if you have to - maybe by hinting that everyone in England will die, but then show a commercial plane flying sky high overhead. That type of ending could have been the most powerful, gloomy, but ultimately optimistic as it would signal that the life goes on in the rest of the world.If this move had an ending that was similar to disturbing beginning, it could have been the most profound horror movie of all times. This way, and due only to ""Ramboisation"" of  the main character, as well as to ""Hollywood ending"" in non- Hollywood movie, it still remains superb - but not THE ULTIMATE - it could have been!So close.Pity the fools.",28 Days Later...
874,kay321,Finally a smart fun horror flick with a totally drool worthy lead.,10,9 July 2003,"This movie ROCKED!!! Not only has Danny Boyle made the first zombie movie with zombies that are actually scary, but he's also managed to make an intelligent film that asks (if not answers) some interesting questions about human nature and what it means to survive. Boyle offers up for our consideration three very different possible forms of survival, i.e. Selena and Mark's, Frank and Hannah's, or the Army boys', each of which seems to work just fine up until it is threatened by the ideas of another. Is survival itself the only  thing that's important? Would one method of survival work better than another?  Is there a morally 'better' way of continuing when the world has gone to hell?  Does  morally exist in the face of extinction and death? Would the rest of the  world quarantine Britain and sacrifice its people to protect itself? Perhaps the  film never truly answers these questions, perhaps it doesn't even try, but the fact  is, it brought them up and I could kiss the writer for doing that. Too often horror films, and films of other genres rely so heavily on the conventions of their types  that they fail to ask the questions which naturally arise from their subjects and I  commend the makers of 28 Days Later for not falling into this idiotic, mind- numbing routine. Also, I think it brilliant that the filmmakers were able to create  such and tense and thrilling atmosphere given the relatively few shots and sequence with the zombies. The music, the cinematography and the editing all come together in this film to deliver classic horror movie chills which had me  glued to my seat my knees pulled into my chest the whole time. And finally the  characters, and they are great characters, were so evidently what the filmmakers chose to focus on and for good reason. Jim and Selena both cores of the film are a fabulous horror film pair, I love strong women in horror films,  and i think that the players did fabulous jobs with making the audience empathize, and genuinely care for them.  I think they are two fabulous young actors and I for one wish them great success.",28 Days Later...

I saw this movie with 2 other guys and we all said at virtually the same time ""The Omega Man"" only not as good. Visually it was a delight to watch.  Character-wise it was fairly thin. Anytime you get to see panoramic views of London and the English countryside I am happy, but that was about the only really good parts to this stinker.The alternate endings actually sucked more than the stupid ending that came with the movie.  One fairly GIGANTIC Question.....if the virus causes RAGE why did the ""zombies"" not attack each other?  In the lab all monkey's were separated in glass cages.  The disease supposedly creates uncontrollable rage yet they all hang out with each other like it is a big party.  Also, this rage seems to cause the victims to forget to eat yet in one scene we see them sleeping.  I don't get the basic premise of the affliction.Don't go to this.  Save your time and you energy.

877,sebkrcoltrane,A Horrific Masterpiece,8,28 April 2021,"From the moment Cillian Murphy wakes up in the hospital, you are thrown into two hours of suspense and thrill, but also an element of satisfaction. Boyle uses different camera techniques like a subtle Dutch tilt and first-person views of the zombies themselves to create foreshadowing and tension before scenes of horror and violence. It is rumoured that Boyle used out of date and older camera models to add an element of grit. Only until the final scene where Jim recovers from his injuries, that up to date cameras were used, leaving the viewer with hope and optimism. However, it has been perceived by many critics that this scene is a dream, a final thought of Jim as he is dying of his wounds.With such terror also comes a moment of saudade, creating the best from the worst. The shopping scene where Grandaddy's 'A. M. 180' plays almost makes you forget about the zombie gore. This creates contrast and differentiates from the standard old gory zombie film done several times before 28 Days Later.In conclusion, 28 Days Later doesn't just give a horrific, gritty, hopeless zombie film, there is also an element of optimism, that in a world of chaos and death, there is still something to live for.",28 Days Later...
878,gerardox-68819,The Enemy Within,8,7 April 2020,"Synopsis: 28 days after a bicycle accident, Jim wakes up in a hospital. Only to later realize that humanity is almost extinct thanks to a deadly virus.Alex Garland, writer of this movie and others like Annihilation or Ex Machina, does a great job as always by creating a more realistic and planned version than other conventional ""zombie"" films. And the recommendation is thanks to the originality of the script, since when you see it and remembering the current situation, you don't feel so detached from reality.As it is usual to see in dangerous situations, and as in other post-apocalyptic movies, humanity's greatest danger is itself, people stop trusting, attack and lose their minds. It has been seen many times, but as this film is an ancestor of many, it is not a repetition.The direction can be suffocating on many occasions, not as current as other films released in that year that are still relevant, and you can see the low budget in that regard, but the history, as well as the performances are so well worked that they make it impressive in several scenes. By impressive I mean situations that are very difficult to see, heartbreaking in the sense that living that would make anyone's throat lump.Unlike other films of the type, among the protagonists there are no characters that are annoying to the audience. It is very entertaining to see them and I highlight the Brendan Gleeson character ""Frank"" which broke my heart.There are 10 seasons of The Walking Dead and it is impossible how it continues to be justified, unlike this movie, and although both are in fiction, you can notice a great difference between what is closer to reality than to fiction.In conclusion 28 days later, it is a film that has an original vision of a pandemic, and life after death for the entire world. With characters and events that feel real, and remind us that in such danger, our greatest enemy is us.",28 Days Later...

Zombie plague spreads around the globe, and there are a handful of humans fighting for survival - pretty much run-of-the-mill stuff, really. Danny Boyle manages to lift this film out of the 'average' bracket, though. A very English film, with British Actors, it does have a slight cheap feel about it, yes, but the atmosphere in this film is very tense indeed.

882,dazcraven,Surreal isnt the word,10,10 December 2002,"The one thing about this entire movie which makes you sit up in your chair or even slump down in avoidance is the overwhelming feeling of emptiness and initial feeling of lonliness. As Jim walks around central London completely alone the audience begins to feel an air of unease. The scariest thing is that in the back of your mind you beleive that some day this could happen.
The movie has taken fair amounts of criticism and prise for the way Danny Boyle decided to shoot the movie Digitally. To me this was a masterstroke, it creates a feeling of unease in the sense its all a little uncomfortable and goes well with the flow of the movie.The only thing that I feel let the movie down was he soldiers toward the end of the film. They were TOO squaddie like in the sense they were overbearingly boyish. I have friends in the army i know what theyre like and even they arent that obnoxious.The cast do well with a good script and a brilliant concept, one that I think is amongst the best ideas to come out of the movie world for a long time. Its an old adage, ""Virus wipes out the population"" but the way it was done this time in ""28 Days Later"" had a different feel to the virus movie genre.I think this movie is the best British film since ""Trainspotting"", another Boyle masterpeice.

Anyone expecting your run-of-the-mill horror flick will be disappointed because 28 Days Later is certainly not your average horror movie.First off, the camera angles, shots and film quality is unlike your typical film. Although the choice of shots and angles were distracting at times, the overall effect works. The premise of the film is that a virus has swept through England, killing most people or turning them into flesh-eating zombies referred to as ""the infected"". The opening shots of a vacant and silent London are disquieting and sets the tone for a creepy, sparse, and disturbing film.The violence is retained into short flashes for the most part and gore is present but not the purpose of the film. Rather, it is very character driven. Unlike most horror movies, you get to know these characters and actually care whether they live or die.Don't expect all your questions to be answered in this film. There are a number of things left unexplained but I found the film wholly satisfying nonetheless. It was scary without being redundant and it had a creepiness factor that is too often missing in films of this genre.",28 Days Later...

886,dkeppens,Day of the Triffids meets George A Romero,6,7 February 2007,"A bunch of activists break into a research center involved in primate testing to liberate all their furry friends in a commando-style operation. Although warned, this way, they also unleash the highly contagious virus called ""rage"" that the test subjects were infected with and keeps them in a persistently bad mood, aka, makes them attack anything in sight. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) comes out of what must have been a coma in a totally abandoned hospital and sets out to discover what's going on, only to find the world a desolate and very dangerous place. This movie is a bit of a mixed bag, which does not come as a surprise seeing as it tries to blend an action-oriented 'dawn-of-the-dead-remake'-like with a lot of elements of Wyndham's masterpiece, where analysis of feelings and moral dilemmas are only slightly interspersed with ""action"". Especially because the latter is best understood by the feeling of impending doom conveyed upon us by slowly building up a futuristic view of the us-against-them struggle. Some scenes though, are very powerful and work extremely well, like when Jim enters the church with all the bodies and a few infected people. Or where he and his companions sleep in the countryside and he dreams about waking up alone, left to insanity by his travel companions. The confrontation with the out of this world reality and all its consequences are the true merits of the film. It's too bad that some of these potentially strong scenes choose instead to flush all atmosphere down the toilet. A perfect example is when they hesitantly drive in a tunnel to leave London the fast way, only to find their path blocked by piles of wrecked cars. Instead of building atmosphere and tension or even smacking us in the face with mangled corpses which should be omnipresent, Herbie goes bananas and we are left with nothing to do but shake our heads in disbelief. I guess that's what happens when two very different problems that should be handled in movies with very different styles get smacked together in a single film. While Wyndham chooses substance over style and clearly identifies the most important post-apocalyptic problems when waking up in an ""friend outnumbered by foe"", almost abandoned world, such as solitude, survival of the species and, last but not least, having to choose between helping others or focusing solely on the survival of the fittest, Boyle under-uses or almost completely ignores these powerful elements. Jim killing of a young infected kid with a baseball bat without a doubt in his mind ? I beg to differ. I can understand his hard-ass female companion can take such actions without hesitation since she has been forced to live with these circumstances for 28 days, but Jim just woke up... Maybe the director should not be blamed entirely for this sudden jump to total detachment instead of working towards it. More convincing performances by almost all the leads (except for Brendan Gleeson) would not have hurt. At times, it really felt like these people grew accustomed to extraordinary circumstances or even the loss of a loved one, in the blink of an eye. The lack of profound usage of the more interesting elements is especially clear when one starts asking the obvious questions raised in the first ten minutes. If this virus has an incubation period of about 20 seconds, then why is central London empty ? Where are all the cars, where are all the bodies resulting from traffic chaos alone ? While seeing Trafalgar square and others totally empty is painting a powerful image in itself, it is far from accurate in case of this ""rage"" catastrophe and a more accurate image would have certainly had an even greater impact. There are other questions to be asked as well. Supposing everyone was inside at the time, why do some people get killed and others just infected ? What's the decisive factor here ? As far as the musical score goes, it's fine in all action-oriented scenes, but is a bit overused in all others. Over-dramatizing can be annoying. Especially when followed closely by more fast-paced, zombie-like action. But i do not solely intend to trash this film. As stated, some scenes are pretty powerful on its own, and at times where Boyle goes full-out for either style, making you forget the mish-mash feelings from before, the result is quite entertaining. For instance, i highly enjoyed the ""day of the dead"" homage where we have a military base that fights of the infected people at the perimeter and even a nod to ""Bub"", the trained zombie in Romero's third outing. The conclusion therefore is, that although both styles are mostly better executed than any other film in their respective genres, the mixed end result is, ultimately, a bit flat. Do not buy, rent, decide for yourself, but be sure that it is still far better than most post y2k entertainment imitations Hollywood spewed out.",28 Days Later...

It utilizes the free, non-hollywoodized style of the independent European directors, and a really modern, end-of-the-world story that really makes you think, if not keeping you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Don't get me wrong, the entire movie isn't a fright fest, and, all in all, it really isn't that scary, but, in fact, very suspenseful instead. The movie does an excellent job of blending these suspenseful moments with much brighter, happier scenes, as well, creating a truly full experience, not a hollow, cheap-blockbuster bang. Not only is is a great full-experience movie, but this is amplified by the fact that it really does leave you thinking. I can't tell you what leaves you thinking, that would give too much away, but trust me, you'll ponder some of the more existential values and lines of the movie. In all honesty, this movie ranks with my all-time favorites, It's something I recommend to everyone.

I know many have complained about these not being ""true"" zombies in the Romero sense but it was about time for a make-over and Boyle killed it. The energy and mood of this film was spot on and Cillian Murphy gave a star turning performance as Jim. With its bleak look at the future it has a similar feel to this years terrific Children Of Men - though much grittier as it was shot on DV not the polished 35mm cinematography of Lubezki. But that is a big part of what sets it apart from everything else out there. from the moment jim awakens and walks out onto the desolate London streets you know you're seeing something different and this fim delivers it til the end. Looking forward to the sequel.",28 Days Later...
892,mikeycorn@excite.com,blah,3,8 November 2003,"What a thoroughly disappointing movie.What a total let down, especially when I was so psyched to see this movie: Danny Boyle, director of Trainspotting, doing a flick about rage crazy zombies and I'm thinking this movie is just going to rock.This was supposed to be a horror movie, right?  Well where the heck was the heart-pounding suspense?  Where were the thrills and chills?  Where were the goosebumps and where was that rollercoaster ride of terror?  This movie had none of that, just a few scenes with these zombies on speed coming after the survivors, but even those scenes fell totally flat because there was absolutely no build up to any of it.The scenes of London completely empty were pretty cool, but by the end of the movie, it just reminded me of those scenes in Vanilla Sky and it made me think of how much more I enjoyed that movie.  About the only other positive thing I can say about this movie was that the music was pretty good, but as for the rest of the movie, I guess somehow the commercials had me convinced that this movie was going to scare the heck out of me and it didn't even come close.And then there were those over-hyped alternate endings.  All three of the endings were weak, and for anyone who actually got lured in to watch the theatrical alternate ending, I feel your anger and disappointment and I didn't even buy a ticket.  The difference between the original theatrical ending and the alternate theatrical ending was so minuscule it was ridiculous.To sum up this review, I'd say this movie sucked, but it didn't even inspire that much emotion, it was really just . . . blah.",28 Days Later...
893,ballinquix03,Brutal and Scary,9,25 February 2008,"Zombie movie fan? Forget Dawn of the Dead. Forget Land of the Dead. Forget Night of the living Dead. Resident Evil 1-3. Not so much Evil Dead. 28 Days Later...so much to say. This movie was, and is one of the BEST horror movies to hit the screen. Cilian Murphy was AMAZING as the man who woke up alone in an abandoned town, got up only to find he wasn't alone. The town was eery, scary, lifeless, and the music added to the tension factor. He searches town, finds nothing, has a couple run-ins with the infected, slowly begins to realize what is going on. He meets a group of people who are UN-infected, hoping to gain security and trust with them. They attempt to travel across the state for safety on the other side, only to find that the only military base there only wants the woman so they can breed more human life. Sick, yes, but is an unexpected twist to add to the already confused. It ends with them escaping, and the ending is somewhat heartfelt and powerful. The zombies are unlike any you've seen in previous movies. Their genuine shape and face is like a normal being, except with white, lifeless eyes, and fangs as sharp as shark teeth. And with the power to move, sense, jump, and eat with superhuman ability just makes you fear for the characters more. The character development is also great, even they form a special bond with each other through fighting the zombies, and become sort of like a small family so its devastating when they are broken up.

Secondly the movie is too predictable. you can guess most of the times about the plot and what would be the result. As the movie nears to its end, it becomes more and more unclear that what exactly the director want to show! is it about the virus that is spreading fast or is it about the psycho soldiers that are left alive.

The film quality is as great as any other film you have seen. The acting in it is portrayed wonderfully and the script is good as well. One of the things that I like about the movie is that ( in my case at least) it gets you attached to the characters. A lot of films will have a good plot, as this one does, but do not leave you feeling much about the characters. I think one of the things about Jim was when he went to his parents house and found that picture with a note on the back. It really made him seem more realistic as he takes the picture and becomes so upset. I gotta say, he was my favorite character. I also like how Selena develops and becomes more caring as time goes on. Frank is just plain nice, and Jim even refers to him as "" dad"" at one point in the film. I do have to say though, I prefer the first ending to the second one that is now being shown. The second one just doesn't cut it for me.

The use of DV did not work. The photography and camera work at the end left me spinning and not knowing (or caring) what the hell was going on..The acting was incredibly wooden. The lttle girl - was so bad. I couldn't work out if she was foreign trying to do an English accent OR whether she was indeed English but had somehow adopted the most bizarre of accents. The Soldiers were soThe plot was full of eye gouging holes. So many of them. Where were all the dead bodies? With 10 million people living in London, surely they would have been a few bodies strewn across the place - or maybe the ""infected"" have a consientious desire to clean up after them. Why were the Soldiers so desperate for sex?Ending was pants. So pants. Why ""HELLO""?????Coolest bit - Selina chopping up her mate in Jim folks pad at the beginning after he had been bit by one of the infected.

I thought the accents were charming too :) I think it's interesting that all the commercials and previews I've seen for '28 Days Later' hardly say a word of what it is about. It intrigued me. My friends and I agreed though, that the last half of this movie proves how piggish men can be, how they really do need sex to survive, and how much power women can actually have over men.

It is one step down from a very poor 80s American B movie. The plot was predictable yet tiresome, the cast were mainly ineffective and dull and compared to his roles in both ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Othello"", Christopher Eccleston is a huge, huge disappointment. I truly hope he is sat at home now regretting his involvement in such a poor piece of cinema. Don't do it again, Christopher.The only saving grace of this film is some the aesthetics of the camera work which uses a similar technique to battle scenes in Gladiator. Frames are removed in the filming process leading to a slightly jerky playback which offsets nicely against the rain falling.However, I also believe this is one of those films like Blair Which Project.

This journey done by the survivors of a spreading disease is one filled with the desire to live and love. I don't want to give anything away, but this is a fantastic film, beautiful in every sense of the word. It's a terrifying, and very much believable story about the destruction of the human race. It's also, of course, about surviving, and that's what touched me the most in this film. These are normal people who have to fight for their lives, and they do it, without hesitation. It's also very sad, and absolutely horrifying, to see what happens to humans when they are at the brink of destruction, and what they are able to do when morals and hope are put to rest. But it's also a very beautiful film, with many scenes about having to leave the people you love, and having faith in nature's own ways. And then there's something that I can't really put my finger on. There's a feeling throughout the film that says ""This could be you. This could be your little town, your country.""

But what about the portrayal of the military?  What dignity, conscience, morality, compassion, or caring did they show?  What redeeming qualities distinguished them from the rage and mindlessness of infected humanity? These were supposed to be ""thinking"" men.  We all know what they were thinking with.  Did these look like guys who really gave a crap about the future and their progeny?  Umm, I don't think so.  I found them pretty much one dimensional, over-the-top caricature, complete with lusty sneers for their female prey!  It did make me think... but not in a good way.  They seemed more like they'd gone without sex for 28 years rather than 28 days. I found them more contrived than anything else.  The rest of the acting was definitely a cut above most of the films of this type.
Overall though, I think 28DL ads something to its genre.  It will definitely have a following.  For me it was mostly an eerie and haunting look at the chaos of doomsday.

The opening 10 minutes I will never forget.The all-UK cast is equally brilliant.

Brendan Gleeson as Frank whose left to take care of his teen daughter after his wife is killed in the attack is wonderfully frightened and stoic.Christopher Eccleston as the commander of a renegade military outfit who actually started the attack but claimed to have "" the answer to infection "", Naomie Harris and Noah Huntley are wonderful in supporting roles.

Only Good!",9,29 June 2003,"Years ago, George Romero (father of the zombie genre) created movies like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and ""Day of the Dead."" Unfortunately, soon after the eighties, the living dead genre died (no pun intended).  Except for a few here and there (I.e.: the hilarious ""Return of the Living Dead"") it seemed there where no longer any independent zombie movies in the works.But, that began to change as a game called ""Resident Evil"" began to become a hit to both video-game junkies and ""normal"" people alike.  It seemed that a video-game had sparked a curiosity into zombies once again, and soon enough, a movie was in the works.Unfortunately, what started as a good idea (Romero to write and direct the film adaptation) soon became a nightmare (shlock-master Paul W.S. Anderson took over).  The result was a disaster- a Hollywood-made zombie film (is that an oxymoron?) with no gore and could have easily passed for a PG-13 rating, had it not been for two shots of nudity on the lovely Milla Jochavich.  I lost hope in the zombie genre...But now, after finally being able to see ""28 Days Later...,"" I must give my heart-felt thanks to Danny Boyle- he was able to craft a great zombie film, that carries with it both social dilemna and horror (not to mention a few moments of humor).  Not only is this a good zombie film, it is probably the most beautiful and smartest living dead movie ever made!Is it better than ""Dawn of the Dead?""  No.  Does it lift moments of its plot from ""Resident Evil?""  Yes.  Is that a bad thing?  No, not at all seeing as this is a good movie.  My only problem with this movie (though it really isn't anyone's fought) is that sometimes the British accent was so thick, I couldn't tell what the actors where saying- of course, if this was an American-made movie it would probably be a butchered mess.***1/2 out of ****",28 Days Later...

True, I haven't seen much of them to be a fair judge on this one, but... even an idiot can see that this is a great movie, even if you might dislike its genre or subject.Although not a real zombie film (people are actually infected by the rage virus, but it makes them actually even more scarier than they would be as living corpses), it has all the elements of one.Post-apocalyptic setting? Check. A group of survivors fighting to survive? Check. Great atmosphere that leaves people tense and jumpy? Check. Multiple enemies? Check.And last, but not least...A kinda scary realization one gets at the end about the whole rage thing. Great parallels between the main protagonist, Jim, and his enemies can be shown, which I can explain in detail if someone's interested.Also... Music. Can we just mention music?John Murphy's In the house - in a heartbeat is just a perfect music for the climax of this movie, and the usage of Godspeed Black Emperor!'s East Hastings, although shortened and including only one part, is haunting whilst the main character Jim walks the abandoned streets of London.The whole movie was shot on DV (using Canon XL1 cameras), and it gave off the feeling of everything being more realistic, grittier, and after all, more believable. Overall, I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you are not too fond of the horror genre. This is much more than that. It has elements of drama, post-apocalyptic movies, etc.It is followed by the graphic novel 28 Days Later: The Aftermath which sets its story between this movie and its sequel 28 Weeks Later. Although not bad either, that movie is nowhere as great as the original, mostly due to the overuse of the shaky-cam and some unexplained things about the Infected, mostly regarding a character who had some memory preserved even after his infection.28 Days Later gets 10/10 from me.",28 Days Later...

Sure you can argue that the entire first act is lifted out of John Wyndam's ""Day of the Triffids"", but all great horror films pay homage to the works that have come before, a sort of nod to those who have inspired you.Despite the obvious cliches that are inherent to all horror films, this is a truly inspired take on ""Post-Apocalyptic Sci-Fi"". One can truly begin to see themselves reflected in Jim's (the main character) actions, we may not always agree with them, but we have the luxury of not running through the streets of London while crazy ""Rage"" infected Brits give chase.In all this film works, it isn't going to win any Oscars, but it will certainly become one of the great ""Zombie Cult Epics"" sitting proudly next to its brothers, ""Night Of The Living Dead"", ""Evil Dead"", and others who's voice whisper from the shadows of this remarkable film.",28 Days Later...

Danny Boyle and Alex Garland have brought new life to a genre of film that has been floundering in recent years. Big budget Hollywood Zombie films like ""Resident Evil"", have taken the heart out these usually symbolic and intelligent films. A good Zombie film, like any good Horror film always has a message somewhere under the gore and mayhem, the statement about race in ""Night Of The Living Dead"", or even love as in ""The Cemetery Man"". Alex Garland has remembered his, his film under the direction of Danny Bloyle is a true Zombie film, the Zombies are all too human and yet all too animal at the same time, we see our selves reflected in the actions of the main character, even if we don't want agree with them.

917,wilsorm,If only look were everything...,5,6 July 2003,"*Some minor spoilers involved*
As a fan of good horror, I suppose I should be glad someone actually tried to achieve a truly disturbing atmosphere outside of the typical 'make-them-jump' fest that permeates most of the poor efforts that make it into theaters. This was an ambitious attempt, but in the end it felt like the sometimes capable Danny Boyle and his crew put too much into the look and too little into the story.There are a lot of aspects of this movie worthy of credit. The digital stuff really set off the opening shots in the empty London streets as well as the distant fires of Manchester. The rapid-fire, jerky movements of the infected - at least in the few instances they stuck to this sort of movement (in most of the encounters, the infected just broke into normal runs) - did seem to give the plot some seperation from the Romero zombie films it borrowed liberally from. However, at times...this approach became almost indulgent, going through multi-cut off angle scenes where it really enhanced nothing. (An awkward over the shoulder in an early dialogue scene comes to mind) The intent seemed to want to disorient, but more truly just distracted. My biggest problem was with the plot. The early half of the movie focused on the brutality of this new world, and the unmerciful role basic survival had placed on the group...however, when encountering the soldiers, this was scrapped for the standard chivalrous moral crusade which ended in chaos and could have very well taken the very lives our 'hero' was striving to save. The ending was also extremely disappointing...taking the easy way out of what might have actually been an interesting bit of the story, as the group was now once again free of protection and surrounded by terrain that a character had referred to earlier in the film as ""teeming with infected"".
One of the attractive points of the most classic horror is its greater distance from the formulas of popular cinema. This movie tries very hard to create the impression that this is true in its case as well, however it's all look and little substance. In the end, the entire effort is only slightly less than typical.",28 Days Later...

Maybe I an not as good as the director/producer but there were a few inconsistencies. Although I have never been and do nor wish to be in this position, the first thing I think I might do is find somewhere secure and defendable. Then find guns. Why were they walking around with baseball bats and machetes when all the gun shops would have been open for the taking? Next, why did the army have only one of the infected chained to see how long it/they could live without food? Would it not have been better to have two, and see if they could feed off each other? Why was the M-way void of cars, when everywhere else was full of vehicles? And the smell would have been horrendous. We saw people covering their faces a time or two. But would not the whole world have been smelly? At the end of the day, I liked the film. And I advise anybody who has a view on where and when the 'apocalypse' might happen should watch it. Let's hope it isn't that way. The apocalypse, I mean!!!!!!!",28 Days Later...

Basically, it's the type of movie that you want it to end, but it just doesn't and keeps going nowhere. This two-hour movie is a total torture for the audience and simply doesn't do justice to the theatres and it explains why the British can't dominate the movie industry as the Americans do.First of all, the movie never explains clearly why it starts off the way it is (why's the protagonist, Jim, lying alone on a hospital bed naked. And miraculously a vulnerable man like him didn't get infected like the others.) It also never explains clearly how the monkeys got infected with the virus and it becomes just a cursory set-up of the story. As well, the beginning is a complete drag as it's almost a fifteen-minute running around in a city in England that is already evacuated. The beginning and the end just don't make for a good movie and don't integrate with each other, especially when the viewers also have to put up with the mundane and uneventful middle section.
Secondly, much part of the movie is unnecessary. I'm not going to elaborate it as I don't want to give the plot away. The trip to the army base can't be more boring and unsurprising. Many audiences would just want to make use of this part as a bathroom break, as a lot of people in the theatre actually did. And most of the 'jokes' are so pathetic that the audience would laugh at, but simply because there's nothing else in the movie that the viewers could appreciate and is worth laughing.Thirdly, if you're looking forward to seeing a scary zombie movie, I'm sorry.

But instead, the director didn't use this part wisely and it is shown so ambiguous and hasty that it becomes just some bloody, pointless carnage. You'll wind up cursing the characters for what they've done to each other. Jim comes off as a reckless maniac and a psycho, so as the head of the army. Hence, the movie itself is not thought-provoking at all and just ends up going nowhere and having no theme at all. The movie barely has any plot and character development. It spends too much time showing how deserted the cities in England and how gross the zombies are, but lacks the right development that a movie should have. The interactions between the main characters are very contrived and reveals little of their personalities. Many characters eventually become a bunch of one-dimensional characters. As a result, you don't feel for the characters in the movie and sometimes you'd even hope that they'd die soon so you could go home earlier with your frustration.This movie simply doesn't make an iota of sense (The story itself is already so stretched and contrived; if most part of England was infected, why isn't there any foreign assistance? Why the other countries just quarantined England? What the hell is the U.N and Uncle Same doing?). The title 28-days have nothing to do with the plot but simply just a haphazard number of days that the story goes along, and it also doesn't fit the tagline: The days are numbered.

It still sucked!,1,14 July 2003,"North Americas 1st look at the UK's most horrifying film of '02 Danny Boyle reinvents ZOMBIE HORROR and its scary as hell The scariest film since The Exorcist.BULL*!#@.. With promotions we all have read what are we to expect? I am tired of hearing bring your brain, blah.. blah.. It was not that hard to see the obvious lord of the flies undertone after the 1st 6-10 mins of the film apes watching TV infected with ""RAGE"" horrible plot, but hey its a movie (not the best of writting).All the philosophy and deep thought aside, where was the horror? Anybody who says they were scared of the 100% predictable jump out I gotcha scenes have to be female or female at heart. Thats right I called y'all punks (to be ebonically correct bitches)! The scariest thing about the movie was the car alarm 5 mins into the movie.  You always knew when something was going to happen. you would see an infected (technically its not a zombie) run through the camera scene before anything would happen.This is why we hated the movie (those of us who hated it) We went in expecting a great horror movie along the lines of The Exorcist, Nightmare on Elm street (1st one only), friday 13th(1st one), night of the living dead, 13 ghosts. We were told to expect it. The reviews and promos never said, ""a thought provoking movie by Danny Boyle, the most heart felt movie since the pianist"".  If I told you that frugraba was the best tasting thing since milk chocolate you go eat it and it taste like human feces, you would complain. Then you're told to look at from our viewpoint its brown, it looks like chocolate. Don't like it? Too bad we have your money already.This movie is not for fans of the genre! Ghost of mars was a better horror movie jason vs freddy will be a better movie and I am not going to see it!

934,howard_offtherails,Proof that British thrillers can really be great,10,10 February 2004,"I can't understand most of the criticisms that have been made against 28 Days Later. This is not supposed to be a chronicle of how the world would deal with infectious disease. It is about how people - different people - would react to such a situation, given incomplete information and the complete breakdown (and disappearance) of society.The main character - the principle principal as it were - is Jim. 28 Days Later really centres around his movements and thoughts. He moves through the film in search of a father figure, eventually learning to take control of his own survival. If that premise sounds corny and familiar, its execution is anything but.As the film progresses, the characters' situation moves on and things get better for them. From the underground shop where Jim spends his first night, to Frank's fortified tower block and, later, the stately home outside Manchester where the film finishes, we see progressively better conditions.However, this sanctuary also serves as the greatest threat to the characters' survival. I won't give away any details, but Christopher Ecclestone's performance is utterly believable and the final plot twist provided (at least for me) a genuine surprise. Thus, the story loses neither pace nor focus at any point. All-in-all, it's a great story and a satisfying experience.28 Days Later may be magnificent, but its presentation on DVD is even better. Many films get a DVD release with a poor selection of making-of documentaries, unfunny footage of the cast messing around, pointless trailers and terrible deleted scenes.The technology is put to its best use when taken completely seriously. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland have put a huge amount of effort into the DVD release - providing an informative and engaging commentary of the film, including an alternative ending that was never even shot. No matter, though - a storyboard has been drawn up and the writer and director read from the script to fill in the rest of the movie. It is an intimate experience - almost as though you are sat in a room with your mates.The on-disc documentary - ""Pure Rage"" - sensibly avoids being sycophantic drivel. It's a genuinely interesting look at the production process as well as a crash-course in infectious disease - better than a lot of TV documentaries!Altogether, the film itself is superb, and the DVD is a valuable addition to anyone's collection - if you like to think from time to time, of course.",28 Days Later...
935,xredsunrisesx,"Fantastic New Horror Film from Director Danny Boyle, the new Zombie standard",10,24 February 2004,"Let me first say that  28 Days Later  is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. From the director of Trainspotting, The Beach and Shallow Grave Danny Boyle delivers an edge of your seat Horror movie that will have you leaving the lights on at night and checking the locks on your doors.  The Film is grainy, fast paced and has a  powerful soundtrack  which adds to the very chaotic feel to the movie. This is not a typical `Zombie' movie, the `Infected' in the film are quick, smart and unrelenting this is a nice change from other slow paced sometimes non climatic zombie films such as the classics: Night Of The Living Dead, Day Of The Dead and other films of this genre. Not to say these movies are not up to Zombie par but the heart pumping vision of Danny Boyle's film will make you short of breath rather than fighting to stay awake. All around great acting especially from new comer Cillian Murphy who portrays the lead character `Jim'. From start to finish this character is never really resting running from one scenario to another . Meeting up with interesting characters along the way the small yet effective cast makes it a compelling story.Although the general `last man on earth' concept has been done I believe this film still makes it unique and never boring. So if you're a Horror\Thriller fan and have a strong stomach for some well placed gore than I would strongly suggest giving 28 Days Later a test run, for true Zombie movie fans I think you'll find this a nice twist.",28 Days Later...

I think all the special effects with blood were really cool. I do not want to give the story away, but the idea that animal testing could result in such a massive 'infection' is really scary.  It sort of reminds me of '12 Monkeys' and the animal testing that they were doing. Then the idea that all of mankind could be totally erased.

937,xstellathediverx,more than just a zombie flick,10,22 June 2004,"Directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting), 28 Days Later is one of the best films of the past 10 years. Featuring an previously unknown cast, the film tells the story of a rage virus, unwittingly set loose on England by a group of animal activists. Our protagonist, Jim, awakens 28 days later in a deserted hospital, completely unaware of the rage virus and what it has done. He wanders through desolate London, searching for someone, something, that can explain to him what is going on. Eventually he finds it, a newspaper reading EVACUATION, missing posters, and desperate notes for loved ones left on a communal message board. However, Jim still has no idea about what has done this and that he is in danger. He finds his way to a church only to encounter an infected priest and to be chased by various others. Luckily he is saved by Selena and Mark, two other survivors who are doing their best to live. They inform Jim of what has happened, the rage, the deaths, the evacuation and so on. This is a lot to take in and Jim refuses to believe that his parents are definitely dead. The next day the group sets off to Jim's home, where they discover his dead parents. Later that night the house is attacked by infected and Selena has no choice, but to kill Mark. Jim and Selena flee the scene which will soon attract more infected. Eventually they come upon a father and daughter family surviving in a block of flats. The group sets off after hearing a radio broadcast telling of the cure to infection. However, there's more to that promise than they expect.28 Days Later is an excellent film which forces the viewer to think and feel.

It has everything from gory scenes, prodigious zombie battles, struggles of all sorts, & it even fits in some self growth aspects. As for those prodigious zombie battles, you won't be let down by non realistic survival skills that you hate to watch & roll your eyes at. There won't be any of that.

939,my_dad_hussles_mooses,28 Days Later...,9,3 July 2007,"It's not often Britain produces a post apocalyptic drama of the quality of 28 Days Later. But then it's not often Britain produces a director of the calibre of Danny Boyle. From the breathtaking opening sequences of Cillian Murphy's Jim, awaking four weeks after a catastrophic viral outbreak and wandering the deserted streets of London (in a scene clearly inspired by Day Of The Triffids) to the final reel's horrific and violent conclusion, this is a film that stuns and awes with a variety of tactics. Firstly, that opening sequence.outstanding! Never has London been captured looking so still and convincingly lifeless. To call it atmospheric does not do it justice and full credit must be given to Boyle for utilising digital cameras to enable him to capture such effect. The entire film is shot on digital camera and there are a lot of hand-held shots which were obviously used so that they could get some extremely tricky shots done quickly and they also put the viewer in the thick of the action.When Jim does find signs of life, he soon wishes he hadn't as he encounters people stricken with a virus turning them into contagious violent sociopaths. Encountering other survivors, 28 Days Later tells the story of this disparate group and their struggle to survive in an incredibly hostile world where even potential saviours are not what they seem. As with all great zombie films (pedants insist ""It's not a zombie film"" but whatever) the most sinister threat does not come from the infected, but from conflicting interests between the survivors. This is a film about people, with zombies, and not the other way around. It is not a horror film it is a human drama, mainly about relationships. The final set piece is the only time we descend into horror film territory with a thunderstorm and many more typically horror conventions being utilised. It could be argued that 28 Days Later struggles to live up to the promise established in it's opening half hour, but when you consider just what a feat of film making this first 30 minutes is, this is really scant criticism. Besides which itcouldn't be argued that the dip in quality is any where near substantial enough as to render the rest of the film uninteresting.Unlike the redundant Dawn Of The Dead remake that came soon after this film the violence is not forgettable nor gratuitous. There is action, but it feels gritty rather than stylish and unlike that film, the violent scenes are memorable because we have feelings towards the characters as they are more developed than stereotypes. Cillian Murphy turns in agreat breakthrough performance as Jim. He displays the appropriate level of confusion and disbelief at the beginning and shows compassion to the people he meets before finally being utterly merciless to those who've wronged him and tried to harm his companions. Credit must also go to Christopher Eccleston who puts in a solid performance as Major Henry West, commanding officer of a group of soldiers who is easily the most interesting character in the film. One gets the impression that before the outbreak, the Major was an upstanding English gentleman and model soldier. However when we meet him he is in an extraordinary situation and he is prepared to be merciless toward those he is trusted to protect in order to maintain his position. He makes for a most interesting villain as it would be too easy to simply label him a ""bad guy"", rather he is a desperate man stuck between a rock and a hard place. Eccleston's performance makes it clear that he is not at ease with what he is trying to do, but that he feels it to be the more preferable of his available options.A treasure of modern British cinema, Danny Boyle continues to show he is not confined by the concept of genre and is one of the best British directors going. Cillian Murphy's breakthrough (and arguably still his best) role, as well as a stunning villainous turn from Chris Eccleston make this a total must see. Just steer clear of that godawful sequel....",28 Days Later...

I don't experience any emotions (other than boredom) when stupid people die on screen; this is why this movie is so great! It shows the growth of Jim (Cillian Murphy) as he progresses from clueless to stupid to weak to strong to deadly. Also, unlike other horror movies, none of the characters are two dimensional cardboard cutouts. When someone dies you lose a character with a back-story that you the viewer has a certain amount of emotional investment in when they die. Another great aspect of this film is that it is very well written. For example, there's a scene where a bunch of army guys are sitting around a table philosophically discussing how they feel about the situation, and from that you can see how the characters react to events differently based on their point of view. Buy it, Rent it, Netflix-it, whatever, but you'll like it. Also I give the bonus features 5 stars.",28 Days Later...

Everyone says its a zombie film. Well first of all, to be a zombie you have to be dead. The infected in this film were not dead... they were diseased, they were infected with rage. Zombie, or the actual spelling Zombi, is a word meaning: A supernatural power held in voodoo belief to enter into and reanimate a dead body... or in other words, bringing the dead back to life. In this movie the dead are never brought back to life. The people in this film are still living, they are just infected. This film is very similar to a zombie film, but not quite. I loved this movie! It was one of the best movies of the year... I'm just sick of people calling it a ""Zombie Film""! I just need to correct some people. It was a very good movie though!",28 Days Later...

Perhaps I watched it at a particularly formative time or something but it's really stuck in my mind and is the kind of film I keep coming back to as a point of comparison for other films, particularly horrors. I just think it's brilliant: it's got a great plot with a decent twist, enough jumpy moments and good-quality make-up and effects to make it genuinely scary, action packed but also builds up the characters well enough so that you care about their survival, plus it's got a great soundtrack. I also love that it makes reference to the darker side of humanity in times of adversity, and it's a great twist on the traditional movie of its type.Definitely well worth watching and re-watching.",28 Days Later...
947,lucid_dream08,28 Days Later...,10,22 June 2005,"28 Days Later is an amazing film. It's not a ""zombie"" film as critics call it. It's more deep than that. There aren't really zombies in the film at all, there are the ""infected,"" who are infected with rage and are compelled to kill anyone and anything in their path. Unlike other movies that are realatively close to the same genre, the movie is not focused on the ""infected,"" or zombies as most call them, but the survivors (Naomie Harris, Cillian Murphy, Megan Burns). The ""infected"" are second in the film. What I like most about this movie is the ending (of course the alternate because all of the main characters live) because it has a twist to it. Not only that, but the ""infected"" do die off, which gives the survivors, well, an actual chance to survive. Danny Boyle really does a splendid job directing this movie, and Alex Garland has a thing for writing, also. Another thing I love about the movie is the way it is filmed. It's filmed with mainly digital cameras, which gives the film a realistic look. I think that this is by far the best movie created, and, in my mind, everyone should see it :)",28 Days Later...

Sure, it borrowed from some of George Romero's films, but it still was original in it's own way. I liked the fact that it was filmed digitally. It really gave the movie a gritty, real feeling. The performances were great. Especially Cillian Murphy, as Jim. He fit his character very well. This is the first UK Horror/sci-fi film I've seen, and it was refreshing to get away from typical Teen slashers. I cared about the characters here, to me they were very likable, and realistic.

949,brumby058,An intriguing and engaging film,8,12 May 2007,"I haven't read all the posted comments yet (I browsed through several late last night after seeing this visually stunning and atmospheric film on TV).A few posts mentioned a ""happy ending."" The version broadcast here in Melbourne last night did have a happy ending (the three survivors have escaped to the Lakes District and are apparently about to be 'saved' when their large fabric HELLO sign is seen by the jet fighter pilots), then we had all the credits.This was followed by a black screen with the words ""...what if"" in the lower right corner, followed by another sequence (a coda) in a hospital operating room, showing Selena's unsuccessful attempts to save Jim, after which she and Hannah leave and walk away into the distance along the hospital corridor - The (real) End.While this sequence cast a suitably bleak pall over the entire movie (bleakness was one of its strong points), and was a more fitting conclusion than the earlier, clichéd ""happy ending"" it also made sense of a very short out-of-context sequence seen earlier (Selena filling a hypodermic needle).There was an interesting scene earlier in the film (when Jim, Selena and Hannah and her father are trying to sleep outdoors) where we're led to believe that what we're seeing is actually happening, only to find that it's Jim's dream.The whole of the pre-credits sequence (the 'happy' ending, including the deux ex machina of the jet plane) was also Jim's dream, but this time as he was dying, despite Selena's efforts, from his gunshot wound.",28 Days Later...

951,vjj,28 days too long,5,27 October 2005,"The promo commercials for this movie led me to believe this was a new twist on the zombie film, but in reality it's just a poorly scripted sci-fi/horror flick.Okay, a mysterious disease that causes you to turn into a berserk killer with weird red eyes in less than a minute is let loose on the London population. You get infected through a bite or absorption through breaks in your skin of blood/fluid from the berserkers...so the quick fall of London can be accepted. Thing is, the berserkers are not zombies because I did not see them consume the flesh of their victims. And they're not invulnerable...a well place baseball bat, hatchet, or bullet can do them in. So it confused me that after the first 2 weeks of mayhem, the British military or UN would have caught on, quarantined London, and then send in troops in bio-hazard suits complete with tanks, flamethrowers, etc. to mop up the berserkers. In other words, a tighter time-line, a tighter script.Now mind you, having a red eyed, banshee screaming nut job coming at you full tilt is a refreshing change from the usual shuffling zombie gig, and the grisly reality of what to do with a bitten companion before they turn berserker gets you on the edge of your seat...but this film just lacked the claustrophobic atmosphere of any decent ""zombie"" flick ..... the interpersonal reactions between various characters just didn't hold my interest, and the obvious ""villainous turn"" by some of the survivors was too obvious to surprise me.Bottom line: hype sold this film, but hype won't keep your interest in it.",28 Days Later...
952,p-m-boyer,Follish Blokes who take it as it is.,9,8 April 2007,"28 Days Later... Where does one start to describe the mind blowing movie that is 28 days later? This movie from top to bottom, may be one of the best movies to date, and if you want to say horror movies, then this movie also reigns supreme.Danny Boyle certainly knows how to direct a movie, and it is clearly shown in his depiction of the end of well... England as we know it. He never pushes the movie too far, but he knows where he can push, and he has done the perfect job, often showing just what cinema and drama should be.The lead actor Cillian Murphy does a great job playing a confused and troubled human as he stumbles upon a series of events that will forever change his and his friends lives. Naomie Harris also does an extraordinary job playing the tough woman who believes the world is all evil, nothing is everything and everything is nothing, though everything crumbles to pieces.Silly or arrogant people can watch this film, skip over the serious and depressing parts of this movie, choosing to only concentrate on the violent parts of the movie, then later describing it as just a horror movie. This movie goes beyond being a horror movie, it is one of the most heart wrenching dramas I have ever seem. This movie clearly depicts not only the end of the world, but the true rising of the good of man, and tells a story like no other, this may be the only movie I believe that is totally unique, a movie that could not be re-done, because of its unique quality, everything is just so damn original.28 Days later is one of my favorite films, and I own two copies of the movie. I love every bit of it, and if you are reading this trying to decide if its worth the rent, please rent it and watch it with an open mind, because you may just be surprised.As many movies do though, it left me wanting more greatness, and 28 Weeks later (the obvious sequel) has a release date for May 11th 2007, and I cannot wait to see it. I pray it is half as good as the first, because if it is even half as good, it will still be well worth the buy.",28 Days Later...
953,williamcurley,zombies... as a metaphor?,10,22 November 2005,"On the surface it is an overly violent zombie movie. On a deeper level however, it is a brilliant metaphor with every character representing an emotion. The ideas of emotion in regards to language and identity are portrayed here in the clearest sense I have ever experienced in pop culture media. The message of 28 Days Later is not that zombies are bad, but how we can lose our identities in everyday life.Jim, who is the personification of hope for the survival of our right to Be, goes on to meet the rest of the very small cast: Mark and Selena, two survivors that are in his same situation. Selena represents doubt and pessimism, and Mark represents a sense of impending mortality. They next meet Frank and Hannah, a father and daughter barricaded in their apartment. Frank represents mature fatherly protection of his daughter's life, and Hannah is a sort of misguided teenage angst. They hear a radio broadcast from the military, that they drive out to investigate. What they find is a handful of soldiers who all represent our most basic human will to survive at all costs, including the need to procreate. The zombies however are the clearest representation of rage, and mob mentality. Both these emotions are about the fear of the loss of our identity. Throughout the film, the zombies are always called 'the infected' and the infection is only called 'rage'. It is the purest sense of hatred and a desire to destroy anything other than their own kind. The movie begins with a scene of animal rights activists breaking into a lab where a monkey is strapped down, with its eyes forced open, being made to watch images of rioting, racism, hatred, and chaos on monitors that surround him. In freeing the monkeys from the torture of the experiment, the activists unknowingly unleash the infection. The one spoken line by an infected person is when Jim is forced to kill a little boy. He has the child pinned on the ground with his foot, and is standing over him with a baseball bat. Through the guttural wheezing and sputtering, the boy looks up at him and says 'I hate you'. It is as if even if the infected had language and separate identity, they would only use it to hate and destroy. Jim is forced to kill him because the infection had dissolved the boy's essential human nature. As a foil to that, when Frank gets a drop of blood in his eye, just before the infection takes over, he looks at his daughter and says ' Hannah, I love you very much'.Each character in the movie has a name and personality. They each play their own role, separate from one another. The director, Danny Boyle, makes a truly brilliant distinction between the person, and people. The person is smart, sustainable, kind, and helpful. However, when it gets to be more than one person, especially in a mob environment, those qualities are lost, and traded in for the good of the group, a sense of not being a singular person anymore, and fear. The zombies are not people who happen to not be thinking straight. They are a writhing mass with no language, and no identity.",28 Days Later...

It's not like a random person trying to kill one is just going to have a few grenades or rocket launchers sitting around, as so they sort of did in this film. So, what's the deal? The people are pretty much powerless then(not trying to point out a spoiler). I just don't understand how that is possible to put into a film.

Later the questions started rising - SPOILERS AHEAD -Why is a patient in a coma surviving for 28 days without medical care? His drip wouldn't have lasted that long! Why isn't his bed full of s***? Why are the streets empty when there must have been a major slaughter going on? Why are the survivors getting by on sugar and fluids when you can find canned food everywhere?Why are the infected filmed in a way they look exactly like the ratmonkey-thing in Braindead? I couldn't take them serious, looking like clay-figures! Why are the infected dying so soon when they don't kill each-other (they seem to be working together). If the answer is that they don't want to eat anymore, why are they alive after 28 days? Why doesn't Jim ask any questions about what caused the infection (he even threw the newspaper away) or what the infection causes?Why does Salena say they'll have to get out of Jim's house because more infected will come, while in Frank's house nobody seems worried about ""more of them"" at all. Why didn't Frank look for weapons when he was retrieving buckets and pans from all the apartments?And these questions just raised in the first part of the movie, I'll spare you the rest.

RUN!If you want to stick around, then this does contain spoilers...The film starts in an animal research lab. Animal Rights activists accidentally liberate ""Rage"", a beefed-up version or rabies.28 days later...Jim, a bike courier, wakes up in a deserted hospital bed (sporting a nice craniotomy scar), having been comatose for some time following an RTA. He walks through an eerily silent London (reminded me of walking home at 6am after a hard night clubbing).These scenes are quite breathtaking, especially the iconic fallen bus, and the ""wall of notes"" around Eros. I did find it slightly difficult to suspend my belief that NO corpses were around at this point...So our hero meets a surviving couple, Selena and Mark. This interlude serves to bring Jim up to speed with the story. Selena then dumps her boyfriend, and teams up with Jim.They happen upon Frank, an indominatble London cabbie, and his daughter Hannah. I liked the initial tension between these two pairs of characters when they first met. I thought that Frank seemed SO nice to these strangers that he HAD to be hiding some sinister dark secret, but I'm glad that he turned out to be genuine enough.The Quartet go in search of salvation, following a broadcast from a military outpost near Manchester. Tragically Frank becomes 'Rage' fodder moments before making contact with the soldiers.Unfortunately the soldiers there turn out to be almost as dangerous as the 'zombies' they left behind - and the real reason for the broadcast was a trap to lure unsuspecting totty to apease the uncontrollable squaddies.In the end Jim has to kill all the squaddies to rescue two remaining girls, and they all flee to Cumbria and presumably live happily ever after.If one were to be incredibly picky, then there are some massive technical plot holes. The nature of 'Rage' being a case in point... if all the 'zombies' really vomited that much blood all the time, they would all be incapacitated by shock and the film would be called '28 hours'... also the Rhabdovirus (which causes rabies) takes about 6 weeks to grow from a bite along your neurons into your brain and start causing an encephalitis - took about 10 seconds with 'Rage'.I loved this film. On the up side it has atmosphere, spectacular visuals and runs at a tremendous pace. More to the point - it is terrifyingly scary.

959,ethan-34,This movie isn't what you may be expecting,5,14 July 2003,"The description for this movie says that it is about survivors of an epidemic banding together. That, combined with a bad assumption that UK flicks are more intelligent than US films, led me to think that this movie would be interesting.No. It is a zombie horror flick where you are constantly bracing for what is going to jump in from around the corner and try to kill you. The epidemic which is the premise of the movie is a contrivance: the infected person will bite you or projectile-vomit blood onto you, and then you are infected with 100% reliability within 10 to 20 seconds. Those who are infected live for the sole purpose of infecting those who are not yet infected. They don't use weapons or tools, or even speak. They're zombies, remember?But their eyes are red and they run around waving their arms, drenched in blood, and issuing blood curdling screams that could not possibly come from a human voice. Yup, zombies.There is an attempt to make for cleverness by having the main character experience rage (""rage"" is the name of the epidemic) in a parallel to the rage of the infected zombies, but the whole premise of the disease and the army barracks is so contrived that it was hard to appreciate the effort. In the end, this was nearly two hours of intense fear while my brain is going ""this is dumb"". At least the normal horror movies have a sense of humor about themselves...If you want an end-of-the-world movie with zombies that has some scares, but isn't quite as intense as 28 Days Later (and it was very intense), and has a sense of humor about itself, rent Night of the Comet. It's a B-grade scifi/horror flick, but it knows that it is B-grade and revels in it. When Night of the Comet ends you've had a good time. When 28 Days Later ended, it took me 30 minutes to recover and I'd wished I hadn't seen it in the first place.",28 Days Later...

The only odd thing was that it didn't scare me - not even a startle-scare. It was very tense and suspenseful during much of it, but I wouldn't have categorized it as horror, myself. To be honest, it may not have scared me, but it did make me cry a rather embarrassing amount. Cillian Murphy as Jim was just way too good acting-wise - he got the emotions across amazingly well. I felt terrible for that poor guy!

I found it scary and touching, horrifying and exciting. The acting is first rate, and I think Cillian Murphy did an incredible acting job.

Leave it to the Finnish to have a rescue mission in a quarantined area. I loved the idea of the rest of the world quarantining Britain without the British actually knowing that they are quarantined. Unless... it wasn't only Britain that was affected by the Infection. The horror and the breathers were appropriately distributed throughout the movie. Two of my favorite scenes were when the group was camping out next to the field that the wild horses ran through and the scene where Hannah (Megan Burns) is pumped up with Valium and sits on the couch wearing a puffy and glittery red dress. Why? Because the first scene shows that the world will go on without humans and that it can be beautiful... probably more so without humans. And the second scene is filled with apathy effected by the Valium and is sickly funny when the Infected pops up against the window.",28 Days Later...

The actors and directors did a great job in creating a very hostile and frantic atmosphere, along with an eery setting, id love to find out how they created such a believable apocalyptic London. This is was in my mind rivaling even the original dawn of the dead. And this is by far one of Cillian Murphy's best roles. I really like the finale, its just one of those endings you don't see in many horror films. Just a must see for horror film fans or even movie fans, go out and rent or buy this movie!!!",28 Days Later...
974,sarahaveryandrews,a decent watch but loopholes were rather distracting,6,1 May 2021,"Likes
(+) focus on human dynamics and relationships over theatrics of the infected was refreshing and appreciated
(+) cinematography and overall style
(+) first act was well done (streets of london, jim finding his dead parents)
(+) enjoyed quite a few poignant moments (jim and selena's interactions, the four survivors enjoying the little things)
(+) solid performances from cillian murphy, naomie harris, & brendan gleesonDislikes
(-) really bad acting from megan burns (hannah) - it's to the point where it takes attention away from the story at least a little bit every time she has dialogue, which is unfortunate given her involvement in most emotionally tense scenes (yes she's young but her obvious inadequacy can't really be justified given countless at least half-decent child actors available)
(-) loopholes and moments which lacked logic overall quite distracting:
jim being kept alive in a coma amidst the outbreak (surely hospital equipment would have failed given no electricity or upkeep) and not being more weak having woken up from a month-long comano looting in convenience stores and supermarketeerily quiet streets of london scene was wonderfully done but seems unrealistic that not more wreckage and zero bodies were left in the wake of the rage virus (makes the bodies found in the chapel more dramatic but doesn't make sense in general)frank taking the stupid risk of travelling through the tunnel given a safer alternative didn't make sense since he stressed that his main priority is to protect his daughter + never putting on extra protective gear during the trip even though he used it in his very first scenewhile i liked the commentary on the loss of humanity (soldiers wanting to rape and force the two women to reproduce in order to start anew) over the literal loss of humanity, it seemed unrealistic that they would resort to being this desperate after only 4 weeks especially since their knowledge of how the virus is spread (through blood) and the time it takes to infect someone (10-20 seconds) would warrant at least looking into the possibility mentioned by sgt. Farrell that the virus never made it out of the UK in spite of rumours via supposed radio chatternever understood why jim left the gun-knife stuck in jones and didn't take it with him to defend himself against other military personnel/the infected guy - clunky maybe but still practical and more realistic as opposed to him overpowering the soldier at the end and gouging his eyes out given he's a bike courier who's very recently awakened from a comai get wanting a happy ending but having him survive the bullet to the stomach was again unrealistic, especially given the unlikeliness that selena would have found a hospital in time and administered treatment, assuming she even knows how to (could've at least have him clinging to life in the last scene with the plane being a possibility of salvation as opposed to him running around with a bandage as though he's largely unaffected)",28 Days Later...

977,skitzoild,28 Days Later - A future horror classic in the style of a docudrama,9,24 November 2006,"Review  '28 days Later' His fear began when he woke up alone. His terror began when he realised he wasn't.The film starts when a group of animal rights activists who have broken into a research facility let out of a cage a monkey that is infected with a contagious virus despite the begging of the scientist in charge of operations. Transmitted in a drop of blood and devastating within seconds, the virus locks those infected into a permanent state of murderous rage. The virus spreads from one monkey 28 days later, Jim wakes up from a coma in hospital to find London completely deserted. He meets up with some other uninfected people and the film follows them as they fight for survival on their search for a sanctuary. They pick up a broadcast on a radio coming from a military encampment near Manchester so they go north but little do they realise that it is not only a deadly virus that threatens them.The beginning of the film, when Jim wakes up to find London's streets trashed and completely deserted is extremely powerful. An extremely eerie atmosphere is created through imagery alone as there is little dialogue. It is obvious that complete chaos has taken place in the 28 days between the virus escaping and Jim waking up. The previous scene in which the animal rights activists release the monkey is a very frantic one which makes the eerie quietness of the following scene all the more effective. The exteriors of the streets of London were shot in the early hours of the morning on weekdays. The crew only had a couple of minutes each day, and crew members had to politely ask clubbers not to walk onto the streets. Most of the film was made using digital cameras to give it the real look (the final scenes in the cottage were shot on 35mm film). An added benefit of the digital filming was that the London shots could be set up and executed much quicker than otherwise possible which helped the filmmakers exploit very tight time windows to complete the scenes of an empty London. The music in this scene fits well as does the music for the duration of most of the film. In a lot of horror films I feel that scary music is overly used but it is not here. Another thing that I liked about '28 Days Later' was the fact that the surnames of Jim, Selena, Mark, Frank, and Hannah are never revealed, either during the film or in the credits. Likewise, the names of Jim's parents are never revealed. In a post-apocalypse situation surnames have little use as there are so few survivors your first name is likely to be unique to you.When the characters reach the military encampment is where Danny Boyle cleverly turns an apocalyptic movie into a study of the human race: can the people who are supposedly meant to protect us be actually worse than the ones who have fallen to a devastating plague? The answer, quite simply, turns out to be yes. That this makes Jim do a much needed transition from dazed youth to fierce survivor drives the point home even more: Rage wiped out most of the population, as a virus, but in given circumstances, is found quite well within us, and Jim becomes so filled with it at one climactic sequence it takes Selena a second before realising that he hasn't yet been infected.Overall I thought that this film had a tight, gripping storyline despite a few loopholes and the acting was powerful and convincing. This film conveys strong feelings of sadness, isolation, emptiness and helplessness which are all closely associated with rage.Overall rating = 9/10",28 Days Later...
978,keith@pankhurst.clara.co.uk,Just did not work for me,1,22 November 2003,"I'm astounded by all the positive comments for this film, because it just did not work for me. The characters were shallow, and predictable. The plot was lame, and relied on people doing unreasonable things in the circumstances just to move it alone. The jumpy, flashy, 'arty' film sequences, which are so effective in some films, were just irritating. Oh yes, and even in the context of a Zombie movie, the whole thing totally lacked any creditability. I mean, why for example, would the soldiers be on the verge of suicide because of the lack of women after just one month!Maybe it worked better on the big screen, but the region 2 DVD on my 32"" TV didn't work. It certainly wasn't helped by the excessive compression of the DVD - one of the worst I've seen; but I can't believe that even fixing that would have made that much difference. In my opinion the whole thing should be buried in a Shallow Grave.",28 Days Later...

980,bruno-d-1,Empty city = fear,9,14 November 2006,"28 Days Later is a film about zombies causing havoc in London, which falls into the Gothic Horror genre. The highlight of the film is seeing the deserted capital city. This works so well because it shows well known landmarks in London such as Piccadilly Circus, Westminster and Centre point absolutely empty apart from one lead character. It is strengthened by evidence of mayhem in the wake of a virus ridden city with money on the floor, buses on there sides, crashed cars and ones left open in the middle of the road and canned drinks and litter everywhere. These scenes contrast the safe, every day hustle and bustle of the city centre so well and anchor the viewer into the film in amazement ready for the beginning of the real horror. Another personal favourite scene is on the motorway going north on completely empty roads in a taxi. This again contrasts Britain's packed motorways but allows the camera to go much, much wider and show miles on empty roads and a blazing city on the horizon. This like the first scenes of the empty city draw in the viewer before more shocking scenes of horror.",28 Days Later...
981,losdiasconana,"only 3 things bad in this movie: plot, dialogue, acting",1,21 July 2003,"more than a huge disappointment, this was more like a plain scam. i have not seen such terrible acting, dialogue and storyline in a long, long time. maybe the first 15 minutes are OK in a made-for-TV-movie sort of way. then it keeps getting more and more silly. dialogue is *really* bad, but it certainly fits the actors (except for poor brendan gleeson, what's he doing here?). the last 3rd of the movie (it will seem 7 hours long by the time you get to it) tries to surprise you but it's just a formulaic, sloppy, boring, annoying 40+ minutes long showcase of silliness posing as 'action-filled storytelling'. haw haw haw. the ending: man, is that AWFUL. i hear they changed it, after the release, so now you can see both, separated by a ""but, what if...?"" screen. apparently fox-searchlight wants people to go again and see if they like this one better. a-hum. plus, it's hard to get scared with that inane pop-filled soundtrack. i'm sure ""night of the living dead""'s zombies are laughing in their graves at this pretentious scary-movie wannabe attempt at updating that classic.

I didn't believe it at first, but I've just finished reading Triffids and no joke, replace the walking trees with ragers and it's really quite close.Also, the first scene in the movie is an homage to Stanely Kubrick ... notice how much that scene resembles when they strapped Andy McDowel down and forced him to watch violent flicks?

984,Nysaya,Are people afraid to think?,9,28 June 2003,"I think too much of America forgot how to think with a complex movie like 28 days later.  It's very easy to say this movie is about zombies, but its definately more about survivor.  You can replace zombies with mutant dinosaurs, aliens, and the plot will be the same.  This is not on par with Resident Evil.The bads of the movie are mostly the low budget, though I think that we're too used to bright special effects.  For the purpose of the movie, the budget was fine.  It was a lil grainy, but the settings, props, etc did fine for the movie.-SPOILERS-The best part of the movie was the story.  I don't think many saw that the main character was a mirror of the zombies.  Both had to survive, and at the end of the movie, we as the audience could only tell he wasnt a zombie by his coyness and the lack of red in his eyes.  Selena couldn't even tell until he spoke.  He was so desperate for survival, like the zombies, and was quick, secretive, bloody like they were.UNSPOILERS This movie's theme has a strong focus on the development of a man based on survival, and how mankind as a whole is no matter if theyre not desperate to survival or if they are.  Its important to watch that movie looking for that, and not being being split in half like in Resident Evil.I've heard a lot of Omega Man ripoff comments, and Ive never seen the movie, so I cant say if it is or not, but again I just say look at the theme.  A lot of movies have mankind wiped out completely and some overwhelming force against them.The characters and setting of the story were great.  The setting is England, mostly Manchester and London I think, with the ruins of a chapel or castle at one point at well.  The house also at the end was beautiful.  The weather often conveyed too with the feelings of the character.  SPOILERS Ive already talked about the main character, Id like to comment on Hannah, Selena, Hannah's father, and the soldiers.  Hannah had a beautiful change.  In the end, she showed as a lil girl, she learned how to survive as well as the others, but also that she still was the embodiement of hope, being youth. Selena also had that great mixture, where she stayed able to fight, save for the Selena and crazed-main-char scene.  SHe softened a lot, but for the better because she survived and had hope.  Its sad what happened to Hannah's father, but it showed the importance of hope again and protecting the youth. Finally the soldiers I think had a giant theme of lack of hope.  They didnt view Hannah, who was the symbol of hope, as a girl but as a woman.  Also, they already said they had a lack of hope because they didnt see what future lay ahead, but so much of that was just lust instead of a real hope.
Lastly.. valium.  Come on, you all know valium belonged in there.  Lets get realistic.  Its the end of the world, damn straight people are gonna feel good about it.",28 Days Later...
985,static-j,Not a typical zombie movie.,9,25 January 2007,"Reviewers in the past have been to fast to discard this film as a zombie fest with the an added twist. I disagree with this theory as the creatures in this film are anything but zombies. A zombie is the walking undead whose soul purpose is to feast on human flesh. The 'rage' infected victims in '28days...' however are quite different. They are not living after death, rather they have been infected rage and become feral. They do not wish to eat people, their' attacks are purely rage driven.Something that sets '28 days...' apart from the stereotypical zombie film are the themes. Most zombie films spawn from testing gone wrong, or in some cases no explanation at all. '28 days' is the former, yet it leads into more issues than a regular zombie gore fest ever has before. Along with the unoriginal 'testing gone too far theme' comes a variety of other more thought provoking themes: what is the point of our existence? Is there a justification for war? Of course none of this would matter if the film was poorly made. However this is far from the case. The cinematography is something to be remembered. Every camera angle has been thought out to almost perfection and the empty London scenes are more eerie than any graveyard at night. The camera quality feels dirty too, like a bands first album. This is in no way a hindrance to the film, however, rather it adds entirely to the tone of the film.The acting here is all top notch with many great British actors involved. The best performance however is from Naomie Harris who you will believe has been killing the infected for 28days, if not longer!I wrote this review to let any sceptics know this film is worth your attention even if you are not a fan of the zombie or horror genres. It is a high point in modern British cinema and has more messages and ideas than the entire Romero back catalogue.",28 Days Later...
986,recyclehumans,"At times derivative, but overall a brilliantly realized film.",9,23 July 2003,"28 DAYS LATER is currently my favorite film of the year (this may not be saying much given the slate of dreck we've been force-fed so far, but I assure you it means I absolutely loved the film), and probably will be when 2004 rolls around.Yes, there are elements of the film that are derivative.  This cannot be avoided -- out of the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of genre films over the many years, elements from some are bound to be inspiring to a filmmaker.  What matters is how those elements are used in the film, and how they are turned on their ears to become something fresh and interesting.  28 DAYS LATER does this in spades.Danny Boyle, working with striking cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, creates a beautifully bleak and barren world, devoid of civilization and life (even the streets are empty -- not very realistic, but a strong symbolic image of the isolation we're meant to feel).  The use of DV adds a powerful edge to the film, not for its documentary feel, but for the feel of the story and characters themselves.  Boyle also surrounds himself with incredible talent, including the immeasurable Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and composer John Murphy.  Alex Garland's script is often strong and intense and his character moments meaningful, though his dialogue occasionally falls a bit flat.Never boring or stale, the film saves its scares and thrills.  The scares do not come often at all, so when they do, their intensity hits hard.  It of course helps that the Infected are by far some of the most frightening ""monsters"" yet seen in the past few decades -- their almost inhuman speed and fury jumps off the screen when they're given their few moments to shine.  In fact, the expanses of time where no obvious moments of danger occur are the most creepy -- the emptiness and quiet of London and surrounding areas is enough to unsettle, and that silence in itself is frightening as hell.This is a striking piece of filmmaking that is bound to become a modern horror classic (though I would never classify it as horror).  With great performances and technical craftsmanship, this is a film that does what so few thrillers or horror films do -- it tells a story about characters and asks tough questions about just what kind of world we live in.",28 Days Later...
987,ahodges,Could have been a lot better,6,23 November 2002,"I wanted to like this film a lot, being a bit of a fan of the post-apocalypse genre.Unfortunately it doesn't start well at all. There is no adequate explanation of the reason for the creation of the virus at the lab. The lab appears civilian rather than military, which given the nature of the virus is highly unlikely.The virus given it's effects, method of transmission, apparent 100% infection rate after transmission and near instantaneous incubation time would have level 3 (possibly 4) biohazard containment at the lab. What we see in the film (a metal swipe card door which didn't look airtight and readily openable cages for infected animals) doesn't come close.Security at the lab (even assuming it is civilian) is unrealisticly lax. The lab technician even calls security to alert them giving a partial location to no apparent effect.How at least one of the infected or the infected chimp actually gets out of the lab to infect the rest of the UK also isn't dealt with. Given their reduced intelligence, lack of transport, obvious infected appearance and alerted lab security, for one or the chimp to get out seems unlikely (though given the lax security maybe not).We never learn how the rest of the UK actually gets infected so rapidly to the point that civilisation collapses within 28 days. Given the limited number of infected, their reduced intelligence, lack of transport, the method of transmission and the obvious appearance of the infected it is very difficult to imagine how the infection could spread quickly (particularly initially when there are few infected) and out of localised areas as the infected are apparently reliant on walking. Any uninfected person on seeing an infected person is going to try to escape from or kill an infected and inform the authorities who are very likely to quarantine the entire area. We can only assume the initial response of authority was as lax and ineffective as the lab security.Assuming you can suspend disbelief regarding the above what follows is a film of two halves. The first is good and the deserted London is well done, in particular the street scenes. The lack of bodies seems odd, presumably the limited filming time windows on the streets didn't allow time for them to be placed.I thought the scene at the Jim's parents house on finding his parents was particularly moving.Unfortunately the film nosedives in the second half when the characters try to leave London. The decision to use the tunnel and continue to use it on finding it blocked is ridiculous. As is Jim's decision to investigate a deserted transport cafe. The characters seem to want to expose themselves to other unnecessary risks too.The motorways seem peculiarly free of abandoned vehicles and the motorway in front of the blockade is unaccountably so.The decision to dispose of Frank by getting him infected in a particularly unlikely manner seemed uninspired, since I felt he was one of the better characters.The soldiers were with the exception of the Major and Sergeant horribly stereotyped caricatures. The idea that military discipline could slip so much so rapidly extremely implausible, again like so much of this film. Some of the soldiers dialogue was very unconvincing and unrealistic. I think the less said about this part of the film the better.The ending gives the impresssion of being tacked on. As I believe it was following test audience reaction to the original ending.Overall a film of interesting ideas that could have been made a lot more plausible in various ways and could have been a lot better.",28 Days Later...

There are some great characters, that you actually care about, some you'll like some you'll be glad to see killed, but all solidly performed.The story is well written and avoids the clichéd cheesy scripts that are too often attached to the horror genre. And i must add that the direction is exactly what you would expect from 'Danny Boyle' top class.For me though the real difference between this movie and many others made in this genre is as follows - The infected (the zombie like folk) are more menacing, they turn instantly and they move fast, a combination that would instill fear in every one of us.I don't mean to run down the zombie movie genre - i am a huge fan of most of these films, but lets be honest its been done to death, re-animated and done again, and this was the first movie to break the mould and transcend to a new level.If you like your horror flicks, then this is certainly worthy of your attention.",28 Days Later...

If you are expecting Day of the Dead, look elsewhere. 28 Days Later is a people movie, following the lives of 4 survivors of a rampaging epidemic which has all but wiped out the UK population. The character study throughout the movie is what drives it with the zombies/Infected taking a warranted back seat. My wife normally walks out of zombie flicks however she sat through 28 days later and at the end was pleasantly surprised by it's character driven plot.Overall a fantastic return to form for Danny Boyle and I couldn't recommend this film highly enough.

I really liked the idea of the ""zombie virus"" being more of an insanity virus verses a ""living dead virus"". It honestly seemed a lot more believable than some people dying and coming back to life.Of the two ""28 _____ later"" movies, I prefer 28 Days Later. Simply because it is less of a popcorn movie, and not constantly gory. I mean, it does definitely have its moments of bloodiness; but it wasn't one person being killed off after another. 28 Weeks Later was interesting as well, but it was one of those movies where you just sat there and wondered, ""Why?""

There are loads, *spoilers* Early on our hero walks into a church, crammed full of bodies, people who obviously holed themselves up in an attempt to escape the rage, only to perish trapped in a building. We can assume that many others who escaped the rage would have met a similar fate (just how long can you survive in a small space with no running water and tons of other people)? Oh and on leaving for Manchester the group is seen gazing out of the taxi cab as it climbs onto the Motorway, we can see from the reflection in the cab window that they are witnessing a site similar to that of a World War 2 holocaust. *end spoilers*The acting is spot on they are not Oscar winning performances, that much is certain but like everything else in the Movie, its real and gritty just like you'd expect. These people aren't super heroes they are ordinary Joe's thrown into an extraordinary situation, I wouldn't have expected anything else.One final thing, the post apocalyptic atmosphere the film creates, the feeling of dread and the seemingly hopelessness of the situation is worth the entry price alone.Truly a milestone for British Cinema, Hollywood wish they could make films like this.they can't.In other words, this film is the Mac, daddy.",28 Days Later...

I think that from this point on it just got terrible.  If you've seen The Beach, it's the same kind of turning point that happened when Leo DiCaprio started running around crazy in the woods.
I think the director was too busy trying to make a statement about civilization than actually trying to keep us entertained.  ""One of a kind?""...NO!  ""Scariest movie since The Exorcist?""...NO!

The film reinvents the whole genre of Zombie Horror flicks with it's new approach and inventive plot and outstanding artful directing by Danny Boyle.   By looking at trailers it looks like your typical slasher movie, but the whole idea of an epidemic that kills almost everybody in 28 days makes for a great film. It incorporates the scary aspects but also makes you think and wonder and watch more and more.

Or create such a realistic world to get sucked into and fear.  Then there is the visual aspect.  This film is one of the best filmed movies I have seen in a long time.

1008,wizkid1,The first great British apocalypse movie,8,26 October 2002,"28 Days Later is the best British horror movie to be released in years, perhaps the best since The Wicker Man.  The scenes of an empty London are truly eerie, and the stark, bleak visuals make it an urban horror to remember.  The infecteds (NOT zombies) are not your typical George Romero monsters, i.e. slow and not much of a threat.  They are quick, savage and angry.  The use of handheld cameras and point of view put you in the centre of the action, adding to the terror.The film is split in two halves thematically and narratively.  The two lead actors a terrific, but in the first half of the film Brendan Gleeson steals the show as the ideal father figure and in part 2 Christopher Eccleston is equally effective as the ruthless army man. The film has many fantastic shots, (empty London, Manchester ablaze), but there is a ten minute almost silent section of the film in which is pure cinematic poetry.  Cillian Murphy's slient, psychotic rage is captured by Boyle perfectly. When he exacts his revenge on his captors the editing, camerawork and soundtrack make it a scene to remember.This film may not set the box office alight or live as long as Evil Dead or The Trilogy of the Dead, but it is better than most teen slasher flicks of the 90's and highly entertaining. It has some humorous moments too, and a shot of an entirely naked man for the ladies. Go see it!",28 Days Later...

It sneeks up behind you and then covertly becomes part of you, only when you stop watching it does the quality hit you.  I always hold to the idea that good directing is subliminal, as this is, with flashes of notable brilliance, as this has.To anyone who has seen it and apreciated it, you'll know what i mean. Cillian Murphy convinces as the idealistic coma-wakeruperer, showing genuine desperation.  Naomi Harris also cuts it as the hardcore post-apocalyptic feminist.  The film shows human sensitivity through Brendan Gleeson's Frank, most touchingly where Jim (Murphy) calls him 'dad' in his sleep, with Santa Clause's unlucky twin giving a knowing smile.  This gives the audience a childs perspective, and adds to the appalling feeling of watching universal dehumanisation (at one layer, the film does question how human humans are...).

1011,eab922,Don't believe the hype.,3,1 November 2002,"I went into this movie with really high hopes.  Sounded like a cool premise and it was supposed to be really scary.  I wish.Yeah, it's scary if your short-term memory lasts 2 seconds.  What was that 'whoosh' that just went by the screen?  Oooh, must mean a scary thing is going to happen.  Hey, that guy is standing in front of a pane of glass which is a given a little too much screen presence, I wonder what's going to happen?  Give me a break.This movie looks *exactly* like 'Dog Soldiers,' and I think if you spliced the two movies together no one would even notice.  The lone walk through London is nothing compared to Tom Cruise's similar scene in 'Vanilla Sky.' And that digital camera thing?  So five years ago.  Any scene where action happens, especially with the 'infecteds,' goes by in a blur as if there was something to hide.  Infecteds bellow, guy turns around, boom boom, shot ya with my gun, next scene.  Yawn.The only good thing about this movie (besides the soundtrack) is the acting, which was the only thing that made me not wish I had brought a book and reading light to this movie.  Come on, give us some real scary movies, ones that make us think.  Blood and guts and cheap scares don't work.

1013,demontiggeruk,Enjoy it for what it is!,9,5 November 2002,"Okay, I enjoyed this movie, in spite of the obvious flaws. I know a lot of people have commented that DV is not good enough for cinema, but I thought it gave the film a nicely different look, both ghostly and gritty. It also allowed the shoot to take place in London very early in the morning without massive lighting rigs messing up the shot, or meaning the traffic had to be stopped for too many hours as DV is much more light sensitive (apparently). Oh and of course it's cheap!! The plot although clichéd and cheesy did have enough to say to keep us interested, and was clever enough to use the roller coaster effect (slow, quiet section followed by fast moving jumpy section). However for all of those who are accusing this film of being just like Night Of The Living Dead or Evil Dead or whatever else has been mentioned, try watching the old British SF classic Day of The Triffids. There are parts that made me think that this was almost a remake! It also put me in mind of I Am Legend (the novel on which The Omega Man is based), and the third section, in the mansion just felt like it was ripped out of a very poor Doctor Who ep! Contrary to others I think much of the characterisation is done very well. People do stupid, thoughtless, selfish things in extreme circumstances. People begin to value different things, in the case of Jim a Cheese Burger became more important than his own safety, in the case of the soldiers the procreation urge overcame their sense of decency. I thought that worked. The 'effects' are few and far between, and really probably unnecessary. The infected were just fine (in the best tradition of cheap zombie movies, a few rags, some dirt and a bit of fake blood. Works every time) Some of the acting was fairly bad, but sometimes on a low budget it must be difficult to get good 'child' actors (you know who I am talking about if you've seen the film). At the end of the day if you go to this movie expecting a US style horror / action movie you will be VERY disappointed, but if you go in expecting an intelligent, but ultimately flawed British sci fi, that's pretty much what you will get.",28 Days Later...
1014,gregor_mill,Original spin on a long overlooked genre.,8,6 November 2002,"A major, and welcome, change in direction for the Boyle/McDonald team, and an original (or as original as horror gets these days) spin on a genre well overdue a resurrection - the zombie movie.  Having read Danny Boyle commenting that it wasn't a zombie, or indeed a horror, genre flick I have to say I disagree - maybe he thought branding it as such might affect his audience or something.  Anyway, 28 Days Later has to be one of the most genuinely grim horror films I've seen for years. While it does wear some of it's influences on its sleeve it is more informed by them than driven to emulate them - think the sense of screaming isolation and the all encompassing feeling of dread pervading Romeros Trilogy of the Dead and couple that with one of the finest horror creations for a long time, the Infected.  I'm not one to be easily disturbed by a film but there are some images and scenes that kept me awake at night after viewing.  The film is carried along by some great performances by the cast, none more so than Naomie Harris who shows a great combination of vulnerability and rock-hard determination.  Cillian Murphy too is great, and you really share in his horror and confusion at the world he has woken to.  The star of the show, however, is the concept itself and the Infected at the centre of it. You're NEVER quite sure just how far the rage has spread and are left to think about it without any real conclusions being made, which just adds to the atmosphere of isolation, terror and desperation throughout the piece. Genuinely unsettling, at times brutally violent but completely compulsive viewing.",28 Days Later...

Danny Boyle has created a masterpiece here, which eclipses his previous shoddy work of 'The Beach'.  Proving that you dont need big actors to create a big movie, 28 Days Later is one of the best films I have seen all year.

1017,126steve,Seen it before and done much better,1,12 November 2002,"It's a very basic plot. Our hero awakes from some sort of sleep or coma to find that the entire human race has been wiped out. Surely, you're on to a winner straight away. H. G. Wells thought so, John Wyndham thought so, Matthew Graham thought so, Clive Exton thought so, Steven King thought so!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Need I go on? Now Alex Garland thinks so and he's right. He has written a very nice screenplay indeed. It could have been made into a great film. But it wasn't.I hate being harsh and a critic in the worse sense of the word but this film is shocking (and not in the way they wanted it to be).
As illustrated above we have seen this idea many, many times but that in itself isn't a problem. What is a problem is that all the opportunities that the script gave for suspense were missed. I was left with the feeling that the direction was a triumph of style over substance. Worst than that, the style obliterated the substance.The start of the film feels like very average TV fare, and by the end, it (and I honestly hate to be so harsh) descends into a first year student film. It isn't helped in this respect by the acting (which isn't helped by the casting). I must say at this point that I am not referring to the above the line cast who were by and large fine (Brendan Gleeson is first rate - the only part of the film that has any poignancy). I won't go into story details but the second half of the film involves a platoon of soldiers. It is here when we lose any semblance of reality. I know that we are of course dealing with a fantasy and practical reality isn't always necessary for that but for any drama to work you have to have emotional reality- you have to believe in these characters in this situation, however fantastical. You can be sure that when Mr. Garland was sat at his keyboard creating these soldiers, he could see how scary and threatening they could be if we believed in them. Unfortunately, due to some (sorry) terrible acting, miscasting, and weak actor direction, we can't. They become a joke, (Not the Scots Sergeant, he comes out of it OK), so we lose the whole point of the film.All in all I would rather have been at home watching Holby City.",28 Days Later...

Boy was I wrong. Almost every aspect of the movie was amazing.  The visuals were definatly on the high side.  Danny Boyle achieved a quiet subtley that grabbed a hold of you and didn't really let go.  The plot was definatly something new and fresh. The acting was good, for the most part.  A few characters(when I say 'a few' I mean one) had a kind of mechanical acting.  As the movie progressed though, the character seemed to loosen up and start to act. When I speak of acting I also have to mention the character development that took place throught the film. The evolution of the characters was simplisic, in a good way, and very smooth.  The transition from one exteme of living to another seemed to have happened so fast the characters were forced into a new life. As for the horror aspect; it was nice.  The surprise effect many movies go for, and miss horribly, was right on target in this movie.  I highly recomend this movie.

1020,drmonstereater,"The Drmonstereater gives his opinion of Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later""",8,17 February 2010,"28 Days Later Review It indeed seems at times we live in the most cynical of ages. We often look upon the human race as a walking, talking, autonomous, machine that is without mercy, compassion, or proactive though. A machine that marches through this world, hurting itself, killing itself, and committing crimes against itself and the entirety of the planet. It is often remarked upon that we are one of the only, if not the only, species on our planet that kills out of pure emotional impulse. ""28 Days Later"" gives us an unrelenting, and somewhat cynical look at the most dangerous of human emotions; rage.""28 Days Later"" opens to a experimental chimp laboratory in Cambridge. We then see angry animal rights activists sneakily break their way into the laboratory. They then find hysterical chimps running back and forth in confined, Plexiglas cages. As they set to freeing the animals an unknowing scientist walks in and catches them in the act. ""No! Please stop."" he pleads ""The chimps are infected!"" ""With what?"" the activists demand ""Pure, rage."" he answers. Dismissing the scientist's warning they set a chimp free, immediately it attacks and infects both the activists and the scientist. The film then cuts to a man laying in a hospital bed, twenty eight days after the initial infection.Jim is the name of the man in the hospital bed. Twenty eight days earlier he had been in a bicycle accident that ironically saved his life. Unwittingly he wonders the streets of a now deserted London shouting hello. There is a very despairing and intense scene in which he enters an abandoned church, it is here that he has his first encounter with what the survivors call ""the infected."" Quickly realizing that these are no normal human beings, Jim runs for his life. It is by shear luck that he comes across some properly prepared survivors. Taking him to their small refuge in the London underground they explain to him the current state of England.""28 Days Later"" makes many a wise choice when it comes to presenting its story. As I stated in my review of ""Zombieland"" it's extremely hard to make even a mildly compelling zombie movie. This is due simply to the fact this genre has been tread over more times than the Hollywood walk of fame. There is barely an original bone in the genre's body but somehow ""28 Days Later"" makes it seem like something completely fresh. For an example, most zombie movies the infection, curse, etc. Takes anywhere between a few days to a few weeks to take full effect. The disease in ""28 Days Later"" however, takes a maximum of twenty seconds to take full effect. This makes for a harsh, brutal, killing of any infected character and no stereotyped hiding that one is infected.The second wise choice it makes is the design of its characters. Instead of having an array of characters pick off as it slowly advances it gives us a small group of four, making each death unwanted, and emotionally wrenching, and I mean that in a good way. In addition to this, some of the characters are very cynical of their situation. Take the female side-protagonist Selena for an example. She is, smart, hard headed, and a realist. She gives no chances for anyone lagging behind and often remarks that ""living is as good as it gets."" However, there is optimistic contrast to her bleak personality.With a hard hitting beginning we expect to film to run downhill as soon as it gets far enough to have a contrived romance between Jim and Selena, and thank goodness ""28 Days Later"" isn't that stupid. Throughout the entire film Selena's relationship with Jim remains positively platonic, less can be said about Jim though. However, he rarely ever manifests his feelings, which is a good thing.If there is a single major criticism I have for Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" it would be this. The very ending felt contrived. There is a archetype of optimism being shattered by harsh reality, but the end seems to contradict to whole narrative the film had been so carefully crafting. Disappointed with the natural ending I watched the alternate and found myself a world more satisfied. However, I was still able to remind myself that in the other ending, everyone was happy and fine and therefor it just felt like a bleak ""what if"" instead of a harsh reality.

1022,matthi_as,great movie,8,2 March 2009,"Tuesday evening, 2nd of March, 2009. I'm sitting behind my desk wondering about what film I would write the review we were supposed to hand in the next day. Last week was bound to be a horrible one because all of my friends were on holidays and I had to stay home ill, so I saw more films than one sees in a lifetime. That made should have made the choice quite difficult to make, but it turned out to be rather the opposite. After a week full of good price-winning films, there was only one that really kept haunting me; 28 Days Later.28 Days Later is a zombie-flick, not my kind of film, but when I saw it was directed by the great Danny Boyle, the 'Trainspotting'-genius, and written by Alex Garland, I knew it had to be different. And it was. The beautiful but grim images of a deserted England have a strange breathtaking and even magical aura that doesn't let you go easily. The characters are really profound and they evolve during the story, and it all feels really natural, as if the actors were really experiencing the loneliness and all the hazards, unlike in many other films in this genre. I don't want to forget the actors who played the infected people, because I once saw a guy go berserk and the resemblances are astonishing. What I also specifically liked were the special effects. They were very convincing and spectacular at the same time, a good mix for a film like this one.I recommend this film to everyone, and I think I'm not the only one who does so seeing the amount of prices and nominations it's got. And if you don't like action, the film really makes you think about our society and it's got fantastically beautiful images. I am a bit sceptically about the sequel though, but I intend to see it as soon as possible nevertheless, and I think you will too once you've seen this film.",28 Days Later...

To say the least at the end of the movie, you find yourself wishing you could recover the 2 hours of your life you've lost sitting through an agonizingly poor attempt at a B rated zombie movie. The premise of the movie showed promise, although not necessarily new or innovative, government secret labs, rampaging unstoppable virus, and hordes of flesh craving zombies (what is there not to love?). Unfortunately, the harbinger that brings about the doom of mankind, is a completely avoidable precursor that starts the story on its road to unrecoverable flopdom.",28 Days Later...

The story follows a group of survivors trying to outlast the aftermath of a rage epidemic. The film really gives a new definition to the term 'zombie' because they are not portrayed as slow and undead. These zombies are super fast and very much alive, which increases fear factor. Unlike regular superhero movies, the characters had more believable qualites that were well established, making the story more in touch with reality. The gripping events that build up to the climax were very effective as they are terrifying. Some of the chase scenes were short and under-developed, they weren't satisfying enough.

1025,altermoor,These are not your grandfather's zombies,8,6 July 2003,"As a fan of Romero's dead films, I always look for new incarnations of the zombie horror genre.  Here, in ""28 Days Later,"" is a really fresh look at it.More than a movie about zombies, this movie is a post-apocalyptic vision. The characters are compelling.  The script is harrowing.  The special effects are chilling.  The cinematography is disorienting.But the zombies themselves are quite horrifying in themselves.  Not the usual stumblebum walking corpses.  In fact, they seem to possess rather agile movement and almost super speed.Also an updated concept is the idea that these so-called zombies are not really walking dead, but enraged, cannibilistic, living people, who are ""infected"" with a virus, aptly named ""rage.""  In these days of chemical and bio-weapon fear, this seems all-too-plausible.For those seeking a secret message, an allegory perhaps...  I imagine there are metaphors tucked away in this film.

1026,tbocci,Not for the dim,8,29 July 2003,"I went to this movie with the expectation of being scared. Everything I had heard of this movie, from the storyline to the filming style, described some of my worst nightmares. For the most part, it did scare me, but more by the psychological aspect. The premise, the never-quite-seeing-them style, and the general unease throughout were all realistic enough. I would have liked more tangible tension; we seemed to be kept at arms length (though actually it was probably the constant close-ups and pseudo-artistic angles that shut the viewer out).I liked this movie. I am still thinking about it, and some of the issues it brings to the forefront.All of that said, this is *not* a film for the ""Jason/Freddie"" set. As I was leaving the theater I heard one viewer complain that he had heard this was supposed to be the scariest movie ever, and he was very disappointed. This is a psychological horror, not a serial thriller.Oh, and for those who try to claim ""28 Days Later"" is liberal (or more threateningly, ""leftist propaganda""), consider that it was speaking out against the eco-terrorists, not the scientists.",28 Days Later...
1027,Pagongski,Brutal!,7,21 March 2003,"*mild spoilers*Being out of the movie going habit for a few months, i returned to my passion with a very brutal movie. And i mean brutal in all acceptance of the word, from the mere harsh to the extreme ruthless and cruel experience of the senses. (ok, maybe not all the senses, but having a zombie bite your head off in the movie theater might be going a bit too far)Danny Boyle was not a stranger to me, met him first with the cult movie ""Trainspotting"", and then with the disappointing ""the beach"", but i still had not lost hope on him, and watching this movie was a complete delight. The intense atmosphere, the beautiful images full of  desolation and the dark tint of the film that creeps our spine is something to surely put you in awe. There were also some interesting views about human nature under pressure and hoplessness.The way the movie was shot and composed came as a surprise. When i entered the room, i wasnt quite sure of what i was going to see, if just another post-apocalyptical story or some zombie hunting film. But the surprise was for the best, i found myself grasping for air during some really scary parts. And i dont mean scary because of the horror, blood or suspense, i mean scary for the knowledge in the back of head that what i was watching could happen. And ok, having a half-dead mob running towards you with some very hungry instincts, screaming like mad can be pretty scary too.. (keep an ear for the sound, the soundtrack is brilliant and appropriate and the sound effects, well, creepy to say the least..)Technically, the movie was brilliantly constructed, the fast shutter speed gave the movie a new dimension where every detail, every move had a new meaning, we could see the rain drops falling, or the blood drops rising from the slashed bodies in beautiful texture and perfection. This shutter detail added a new depth, made it more frightening and ""real"" , if i may dare to call it that.For the perfectionist mind, the script might have some holes (and it did), and its not close to being original, but i guess we cant make a script water proof in a little over two hours without neglecting the whole point of a film, right?Just go watch it, ""28 days later"" is a movie that doesnt leave anyone indifferent.",28 Days Later...
1028,BLEUSMAN-1,DISAPPOINTED,6,22 October 2003,This was not the best apocolyptic movie by any means.  Production values were good as was the casting and acting.  The story was very weak.  It felt like there was a big chunk of story missing from the final version.  One aspect of the story that troubled me was the fact that even the more experienced survivors did not acquire any weapons more advanced than knives. A baseball bat seemed to be an inadequate weapon of choice.  I'm a big fan of this sub-genre and it could have been much better.,28 Days Later...

If you're going to see it as a horror movie... don't, the only part that even startled me was a car alarm going off near the beginning.

1033,alicekim78,Why wasn't it released in the US sooner? (contains many spoilers),8,7 July 2003,"I'm impressed. It just might have to do with the fact that I walked into this film expecting a mediocre horror flick. But I ended up walking out concluding, pretty damn good film.In the first couple minutes of 28 days later, you see a lab, you see cages, you see monkeys locked up in these small cages. It's just human nature, just like how Adam and Eve were given the right to name the plants and animals of Eden, to automatically name and categorize this film. I started thinking, ""ahh, okay, Outbreak, oh but it's supposed to be a horror flick, so maybe a bit more kooky, so actually 12 monkeys."" Then you see rage. Rage is pretty much the underlying foundation of the film, the reason for the story. Rage is a frightening disease/virus initially transferred from beast to human in this lab when three animal rights activists stupidly trying to be liberal and leftist free an infected monkey, even after numerous desparate pleas from the scientist trying to convince them that freeing it will cause the end of the world. Of course, they free the monkey and it attacks the only female, and you see the effects. It takes no more than 20 seconds for the human to transform into a red-eyed, twitchingly spastic monster void of any past, identity, or thought that has one goal: attack and make others like me.And as you can imagine, since it takes only 20 seconds for rage to fully take its course, the spread of this disease is monumentally quick -- thus the title 28 days later which is pretty much how long it took to destroy the world, or western Europe, same thing. You do not see the pandemonium that ensues of evacuations or mass exodus, though.You, are then, introduced to Jim, played by Cillian Murphy. The oddly optimistic and lucky hero who, after waking up from a coma (you don't know how long) and discovering his London to be completely deserted and in disarray, runs into a church full of rage infested humans. (They sleep in churches, you know. They love the pews.) I would have to say that this scene, from when Jim wakes up, up til when he discovers rage, is probably one of the best scenes in the film. The silence is deafening. You wonder, is this a set? Is London really empty now? It's beautiful. You see the streets, in the afternoon, eerily peaceful and void of life. He walks trying to gather information on why things are the way they are and why it is that he's utterly alone.You realize that the storytelling of this is a bit more sophisticated than your mediocre horror film. Granted, it is set up in a way where you have to be figure out along with Jim what actually happened, and besides the blatant newspaper headlines reading ""EVACUATION,"" you see the effects of what rage might do to a once teeming city of human life.What I loved is the preparation that the survivors have undertaken to try to live. The survivors that understand the disease fight it. And it's not like ""I know what you did last summer"" where girls with big boobs in wet white tank tops scream ""f*** yous"" into the night, they actually have knives, fire power, bombs, riot gear and know that when they run, they have to seriously book and get to a proven secure place. This is more realistic. You know that normal people's hysteria cause them to go out and make the supermarket run out of their second stocks of bottled water and spam when they hear even a slight warning of hurricane from a local weather forecaster. Then in an apocalypse situation, why the hell wouldn't people just go all out and do anything they can to survive and protect themselves. I liked this.
You see stronger traces of Danny Boyle's direction, besides his artistic shots of empty London, in Jim's surreal dream of his parents where, present-day Jim seems to be watching, but at the same time part of a home video-slash-memory of his parents unpacking the groceries in the kitchen and asking about his day. Oh, and the chase up the stairs scene: very Hitchcock and Vertigo-ish. I likey.Another great aspect in the movie is that mere survival and lusty romance are NOT the only things moving the plotline, if at all. Okay, I'm becoming stuck comparing this to regular horror movies, I'm sorry. But it's hard not to, and realize why this really tops out, because it is, even standing against non-horror films, just a well-done movie. But instead, it is the realization that survival is not the only reason for the movie, or for life after rage.As cheesy as it sounds, glimmers of hope and truer connections become anchoring parts of the movie that not only drive the characters but end up also resolving things. In the horrors of death (survivors killing ragers, remember ragers don't kill, they convert), blood and hanging on to sanity by your mere fingernails, the now surrogate family made up of Jim, Selena (a tough sexy chemist that can kill a rager probably with her bare hands), Frank (resourceful, rightly protective father played very well by Brendan Gleeson who also played Walter 'Monk' McGinn in Gangs of New York), and Hannah (Frank's teenage daughter played by Megan Burns) stop by a deserted meadow where they can have a picnic and relax a little.
The open space provides easy warning to any intruding ragers, so you feel somewhat safe. Frank and Jim happen upon a family of horses running in the meadow. This scene stands out. Here, you see, the push for why these survivors have traveled this far, why they fight for their lives, why rage is such the antithesis of peace & love and thus, so devastating.It has so many chances to exploit the ""boo!"" suspense aspect of things popping out here and there and causing you to jump, but it really doesn't all that much. You see how different camera shots represent different points of view - when a rager is running towards a character, the camera is shaking and running towards them as well. And it's more realistic. If a rager is so void of intelligence and is loud (they make ack noises and twitch like no other turrets victim), they could never really sneak up on you, right? You would probably see and hear them coming a mile away.The film moves on to question organized, emergency governmental systems of survival by the 42nd brigade that the wary travelers have finally found in their long journey by a directional recording that they caught on the radio telling them that ""salvation and the answer to infection"" lies with them. Here you see how it is very much so like ""Lord of the Flies"" but all growns up. Military men, who are not too far away from mere boys playing cowboys and indians or piggy haters trying to steal the conch, set up a seemingly completely safe haven where ragers will never set foot, or if they try, they're blown to bits. However, like all Lord of the Fliesian governments, it falls apart. But here you see. You see the choice that the ""family"" has to make. They are safe here, they don't have to worry about fighting anymore, they can sleep in beds with clean sheets and take showers with hot water, but is the condescension, the sexism (and rape if they had stayed), the testosteroney immaturity better than fighting off ragers everyday on your own?One scene I found a bit jarring, and maybe only because I am American, is the infected black man chained by the neck in their backyard that the brigade was keeping as a specimen of 'study.' It is a bit whiny and American Studies-ish of me to fleetingly wonder what racial messages of having a foaming at the mouth, thoughtless, fettered black man 28 days later... might be sending, and what the NAACP or Spike Lee would say after seeing that, but then I thought again and realized that rage has been an equal opportunity disease infecting any and everybody throughout the film.All in all, I like this film more when I think about it more and more. Although my stomach and muscles were tense, and I'd probably rather not watch it too many times for that sake of my own scaredy-catedness, I think that the film is thought-provoking, but not pretentious, and the characters very well-developed.",28 Days Later...

Unlike some movies where they turn horror legends into robocop looking machines *cough JasonX, this movie stays true to what makes the horror real.

1038,dhanson-2,It took my $8.50 away...,3,10 July 2003,"Although I would agree that Danny Boyle is a good director, I think this movie is complete garbage. The cinematography is stunning, yet the story leaves much to be desired. *SPOILERS AHEAD*The movie begins with a very brief scene consisting of animal rights activists attempting to free monkeys from some sort of scientific research center. When discovered by a scientist, he warns them not to free the monkeys because they are ""infected with rage"". Of course our friendly activists don't listen and all Hell breaks loose (which we don't get to see). 28 days later, our hero (Jim) wakes up in a hospital without knowledge of how he got there. He leaves to find the streets of London completely void of any signs of life. When he enters a church, he finds a floor full of infected people who chase him through the streets. Two other survivors (Selena and Mark), who have found out how to kill the infected, rescue him. They explain to Jim that everyone is pretty much dead and that anyone who becomes infected needs to be killed immediately. After a few misadventures (including Mark's death), they discover a signal in light coming from the home of a man and his daughter. The end of the movie consists of the four survivors taking refuge with soldiers who have sent out a radio signal to any who are listening that they have the answer to infection. When the soldiers decide (between scenes of fighting off the infected with flood lights, land mines, and volleys of machine-gun fire) that they are going to kill Jim and rape his two female companions (one of them a young teenager), Jim outsmarts the entire army unit and uses the infected as a weapon against them. To me, it goes without saying that the writer clearly ran out of good ideas a few minutes into the movie.Moviegoers can certainly sympathize with the characters on screen, however undeveloped they may be. The problem with the movie is the ""infected"" people. These horribly disfigured characters, rather than adding shock and suspense, add an enormous sense of cliché to the film that allows it to be compared to such cheesy zombie flicks as ""Resident Evil"". In fact, the suspense is almost completely erased because the attacks of the infected are usually preceded by fast-paced views of their charges at victims from their own perspective. In short, you are visually warned of what's coming before it even happens (as if anyone needs any sort of clue as to where this movie is going). I applaud the shooting of this film very highly. The camera-work (particularly the shots of an abandoned London) is astonishing. That, unfortunately, is as good as this movie gets.",28 Days Later...
1039,rwynter,The BEST horror/thriller in years!!!,10,11 May 2003,"I know what your going to say, this is a rip off of 'Resident Evil', WRONG!  It is more creative, energetic, fearless, and brings light to the testament of what one will do to survive.  I review films constantly before they show on the big screen, and I gave this one a ten (10).  '28 Days Later' (28) does not have a huge budget like most Hollywood films, but uses imagination and creativity to subsidize what many films lack.  The performances of the key actors were brilliant except for the young girl who made the silly mistake of over acting while under acting her part, nonetheless, her lack-luster performance was over shadowed by the rest of the supporting cast. This film comes at a time where anything can happen and this cannot be ruled out (well, hopefully).

From the beginning of the film, right until the closing credits, the lead characters consistently put themselves in danger by ignoring warnings, instructions and common sense, and put their lives in danger. This is not just limited to the lead characters mind you, the authorities make some horrendously bad calls and have an astonishingly lax attitude to security at crucial points in the movie, much to the viewer's frustration.I recommend giving this film a miss, there are many other very similar movies that you will find much more watchable.",28 Days Later...

Under the rage they most likely felt little to no pain, like they were on drugs, or extremely adrenaline rushes.

Zombies are reanimated corpses, no more then that. These people were alive, just consumed with rage.Other then the misinterpretations of this being a ""zombie movie"" it was pretty good.

First of all, if you are expecting to see Night of the Living Dead, or Resident Evil, then this movie is not for you.  The reason why some people seem to be disapointed with this movie is because they were expecting something else, something Romero.  With that aside, this is an intense movie with great cinematography.  I believe that if this movie was shot with a larger budget it would have been a lot less effective.  The camera adds a sense of realism that is almost creepy, and which helps get the fantasy of this movie accross.  What if this really happened?The reason why I love this movie so much is that it isn't your typical ""zombie"" movie.  It's not a movie with some hapless heroes running around trying to destroy an evil corporation that is responsible for a virus, it's about survival.  The scenerio of this movie is much more realistic to what would actually happen if infection were to occur.  It deals with morals on many different levels, and it's beautiful imagery provide for some very deep hope inspiring moments.(SPOILER:  The scene where Jim, Selena, Hannah, and Frank are sitting in the field watching the horses and Hannah asks if they are infected to which Frank responds with ""They are just fine.""  This one short scene is filled with more hope then in any other movie i've ever seen.)Overall, if you're looking for a slasher filled with gore, maybe you should wait for Jason vs. Freddy to come out.

1044,Guyver1_,A fantastic film that delivers the scariest zombies yet,10,1 July 2003,"For a VERY long time I have been unsatisfied with any films regarding zombies as the main monster or villain. Always feeling that the genre has so much potential that's so rarely tapped into, I came to fear that ""28 Days Later..."" would turn out like another ""Resident Evil"": a shoddily crafted piece of celluloid sludge made solely to interest the fans of horror films just long enough to steal eight dollars from their pockets and two hours of their time that they could never have back.How delighted I am that I was wrong.""28 Days Later..."" gave me absolutely everything I wanted but could never find in a zombie film while keeping the elements from past favorites such as ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" that attracted me to the genre in the first place.
The story begins with an infected chimp attacking a small animal activist group before quickly shifting twenty-eight days ahead to a man waking from a coma in a hospital that's been completely abandoned. He soon discovers that England's been infected with a virus that turns humans into rampaging zombies (and blindingly fast ones at that), before coming across more survivors, and even more terrors.Though Boyle may have used cheaper, digital video equipment because of the budget, I actually found the cinematography truly stunning and beautiful to look at throughout the story (That is, when blood wasn't being smattered across it. And even then in a few cases), and would continually admire the shots he chose during scenes. I loved the grittiness that the digital film granted, and found the lighting and makeup to be wonderful as well. The film feels extremely cold and desolate, and fits perfectly with the ""last humans on Earth"" vibe.Perhaps what I enjoyed most about the film is that it constantly takes situations from other zombie films that might produce a frustrated groan from the casual or logical viewer and completely turns them on their ear for much more gratifying results (SPOILER: For example, while in most zombie films someone within the group would become infected and lead to scenes or dialogue about the moral quandry of 'We know we SHOULD kill him, but he's still our friend...! *boohooboohoo*,' in this film the characters take no chances. When Mark, one of the two survivors Jim initially meets, becomes infected, Selena, the other survivor, waits maybe a total of two seconds before hacking away at him with her machete, and notifies Jim that she'll do the same to him should she have to, ""...In a heartbeat."" END SPOILER).
And the film never refers to the blindingly fast and deadly creatures that litter the film as ""zombies"" at all. They refer to them solely as ""the infected,"" and the script makes the attempt to comment on human nature by proclaiming that they are solely infected with ""rage."" But whatever the reason for their existence, one thing is certain: their sheer numbers combined with the ability to run creates some of the most pulse-pounding and suspenseful scenes I've ever seen in a zombie film (SPOILER: Try changing a flat tire in a tunnel with hordes of zombies coming at you, with rats fleeing before them, and see how YOU feel! END SPOILER). And because the cast is so wonderful and the script so well-written, I actually found myself CARING about what was happening to the characters, which is a surprising turn from the normal ""Ho-hum, wonder if I can guess which order they'll die in"" attitude that zombie movies (or horror movies in general) produce in me.This film offers everything a zombie fan could ask for: (MINOR SPOILERS) an ""apocalyptic, no-communications, handful-of-survivors"" world, terrifyingly deadly zombies, a small band of soldiers armed to the teeth, and even the obligatory ""last stand at the safehouse"" intermixed with ""zombie feeding frenzy"" scenes near the end, all while being held together with a wonderful story and superb acting on all sides.Oh, and gore. Lots and lots of gore (How's zombies vomiting up blood for ya? Gory enough?).I can not express how much this film not only lived up to, but exceeded my expectations. If you're a horror fan who believes that there isn't anything wrong with the zombie sub-genre the way it is (Insert shot of old man in rocking chair on porch grumbling, ""In my day, we only had blue makeup, people who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag, laughable dialogue, and a script with plot holes the size of Texas. And we LIKED it that way!"" before vigorously shaking fist while yelling at the local children, ""Get offa my lawn!""), then please avoid this film. For those of you who are tired of the routine, cookie-cutter zombie film that too closely resembles the zombie film that came before it, and are ready for a horror film that delivers the goods in unsuspecting and terrifyingly wonderful ways, then please, by all means, go see ""28 Days Later..."" and enjoy.",28 Days Later...
1045,kid_a_1177,expectations exceeded (no spoilers),9,13 June 2003,"so, all fears of 28 days later having suck potential have been completely annihilated. this was a peak experience at the movie theater. as music/film are my main passions, having the 2 of them blend together in such a manner literally gave me chills. first off, the composition of this movie was superb. there were so many creative camera angles in the first 10 minutes alone. i had feared that this would be a warmed over version of ""the stand"" (killer virus wipes out all but a handful, struggle between the good and bad side of human nature ensues) and while it was somewhat based on that premise it exceeds the stand in every aspect. the images of cillian murphy waking up to a deserted london were so eerie. it was so much more believable than the deserted ""new york"" (shot in pittsburgh) scenes from the stand. and this is where it went from just a movie to high art. the music for the scene was godspeed you black emporer's ""east hastings"". and it wasnt just a brief excerpt, this went on for a good 7 or 8 minutes. i couldnt believe it. ever since i started listening to them i always thought that someone should use their music in a film and danny boyle finally had the balls to do it. and do it well. the stark visuals of the aftermath of widespread chaos and the death that prevailed, while powerful on their own, were extremely intensified by the music. it's seriously worth it just for that scene alone. like he did with trainspotting, boyle made use of a cast of largely unknown actors. although i think the doctor right at the beginning was none other than spud murphy from trainspotting. at any rate my amateur movie criticism's are coming to a close. all i can say is see this movie at all costs. i can't wait to go see it again when i dont have to sit in the 3rd row and strain my neck for 2 hours.",28 Days Later...

When the main character first appears, its something to laugh at.  When the cook gives his characteristic grin later on in the movie, its something to laugh at.If you have seen any of the Living Dead, or for that matter, Resident Evil, you will be supremely disappointed by the ""ingenuity"" of this film.

How many movies have to be made about this before people stop paying their $8 to see the same story over and over.I actually thought that there might be a novel twist in the plot this time, and my one hope is that I can let other people know that you can expect nothing but the same old drivel that we've seen since the Living Dead... for those with discriminating taste, don't bother to waste your time (or your money).  This movie will neither scare, surprise, nor impress you.
All of the scares come from cheap gags (cars backfiring, zombies jumping from the background unexpectedly) rather than really addressing the issue.Without spoiling the ending, its very disappointing and abrupt as well.

With all respect to the people, who are entitled to their opinions, who have bashed this movie, I vehemently disagree.  Fist and foremost, yes this movie is not terrifying, yet its intent is clearly not to be.  This movie is a drama with a zombie-horror film premise.  The movie delves into concepts of humanity in a unique way. Strong acting minus maybe the young girl drives the movie.  The cinematography is stellar not only in making video look so good, but also in the often high-past, adrenaline pumping high shutter speed shots.  And I must say that comparing this movie to Charlie's Angel's 2 is absolutely ludicrous in that CA 2 is possibly the biggest piece of garbage released to date this year.  This movie should be seen as a work of art, which is dramatic, fun, exciting, and revolutionary though the its turning of a cheesy premised zombie film into to a top-notch drama.

These people all seem to have missed the point...Alright, there's nothing innovative about zombies, and there have been dozens of 'last man on Earth' movies.  But the movie was well written, beautifully directed and ass-kickingly scary.  Like all the best horror movies (including the original zombie masterpiece, Night of the Living Dead) the film focuses more on human interaction than gore.  Unlike Resident Evil, the crap-fest to which everyone compares this movie, the characters are believable...and you care whether or not they survive.

If all you want is slow-moving cadavers out for a gray matter snack, trot on down to Blockbuster and rent something from George Romero. And if you want that PLUS expensive CGI effects so all the zombies are 30 feet tall and they shoot laser beams out their eyes and they're really cooool, then you should especially look elsewhere. The ""infected"" set things in motion and they're a major, terrifying threat to the characters throughout, but the heart of the movie is about how people deal with one another when things get really, really bad. Which (as we see in the movie) is often quite a bit worse than what the ""infected"" would do. No one ever said the apocalypse would be pretty.",28 Days Later...

I was wrong. I was actually staring at the celing in the theater asking for the heavens to stop the movie and let me go home which i noticed where a lil dirty, ok maybe not but i felt like saying that. It was horrible, the movie made very little sense. If the ""infected"" had pretty much taken over then why were there not A. a lot of dead people in the streets or B. a lot of infected running around. It was empty no one around. Not even blood around in the streets to show signs of attacks or peril. It had no real beginning, and i have seen snails move faster then this movie did. The acting was horrible. Ive seen singers and sports stars act better then these people did. the ending.. what ending. was it just another way to have a sequel? Lord i hope not. 16 bucks later I am sorry to say that I could have brought four Frappachinos with that money. I could say again that this movie sucked but it was being giving it justice if i say it sucked it sucked more the i can imagine a movie sucking. This movie was better then Waterworld. and we all know what happened with that one. With that my soapbox is well worn so i shall hop down and grab myself a frappachino, and spend money on something worthwhile. Spend your money on something worthwhile.

1054,rroberts1320,"Not worth a trip to the theater, but worth renting.",5,14 July 2003,"28 Days is different than any movie I've seen recently. I like the plot, however I feel as if they tried to fit too much story into one movie. There were a few different parts of the plot being developed when I felt like they should have tried to focus more on certain areas. It is obviously a low budget film, but that doesn't really hurt the movie's rating as far as I am concerned. What does hurt it is how they don't explain a lot of the plot and they spend too much time with what I like to call ""empty film time"". ""Empty film time"" is when they spend time showing a character doing something somewhat pointless or overly ordinary. Such as walking around, eating, up-close views of facial expressions, etc. While I realize that a low-budget film needs a lot of things to feel the voids, I believe they could have used this time for more in depth dialogue. I want to know how and why the monkeys became infected and a more in-depth description of what happen in the world. Overall, I would give this movie a 5.",28 Days Later...

1056,Calexander1111,"A solid movie, with enough of the elements that make smart horror work.",10,3 July 2003,"A few minor spoilers.These zombies aren't undead - they're `the infected,' altered by disease that fills its host with mindless, dehumanizing rage.  The infectee's transformation is complete less than a minute after contact, and a drop of blood in the eyes is enough to spread the disease.  After a fantastic opening showing the origins of the disease, our hero, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes from a coma in an abandoned hospital.  In the four weeks that Jim has been sleeping, the disease has ended civilization.  Jim wanders through empty London, echoing the famous `Hello?!' scene in Day of the Dead.  _28 Days Later_ is post-apocalyptic, post-AIDS, and post-Romero.The script is economical, intelligent; the acting is solid.  The characters aren't the hollow wannabe action heroes of _Resident Evil_; heroine Selena (Naomie Harris) is  simultaneously a tough-as-nails survivor and a real woman, haunted by real grief.  Jim is no less convincing.  The characters are all solid creations, affected in different ways by loss and trauma.
Boyle is able to convey desperation in the details: when Jim and Selena find refuge in the barricaded apartment of father and daughter Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and Hannah (Megan Burns), we glimpse an aquarium where goldfish swim in a scanty few inches of water.  The situation is there, literally and figuratively.  Our four survivors are literally running out of water, but the sight of the fish swimming clumsily right under a receding waterline suggests more than a water shortage.  Later, when our heroes meet up with a group of soldiers who've made a fortress against the infected, the group tries to celebrate with a feast.  The mood turns sour when the commanding officer (Christopher Eccleston)spits out the first bite of an omelet - the eggs have gone bad.  The characters' reactions reveal the soldiers' group dynamic, and the hollowness of celebration when all you have to celebrate is not being dead.  The omelet is also the first tangible hint that not all is well with the boys in uniform.Intentionally or not, this zombie picture shows its post-AIDS origins. The zombies are `infected,' and the condition is always dealt with in terms of disease.  Fights with the monsters are followed by desperate body checks: `Were you bitten?' The piled dead seen throughout the film look more like the victims of plague than of massacres.The movie is refreshingly free of obvious CGI effects.  The monsters look real, because they are, created by actors and good makeup.  _28 Days Later_ has its share of horror clichés (most particularly, heroes seem eager to take unnecessary risks, but would it really be fun to see them take the safer route out of the city?), but it manages to avoid pitfalls.  This movie fan is particularly sick of that ultimate third-act cop-out: `If you need to up the tension for the finale, just make the monster bigger.'  _Aliens_ worked, but that's because a showdown between two hell-raising matriarchs has resonance.  _Resident Evil_, a recent zombie flick for kids, subjected audiences to a bogus third-act CGI monster that had little to do with zombies and even less to do with good storytelling.  The third act of _28 Days Later_ works, in part because by this point we care about the characters, and in part because (as with the best horror movies) the real horror is powered by human players, not supernatural ones.
Danny Boyle may claim to dislike horror movies, but _28 Days Later_ borrows extensively - and effectively - from the hallowed canon of zombie cinema. The subgenre has always been a delightful mix of brilliance and kitsch, but Boyle tries (sometimes too hard) to avoid the latter.  If bearing good cinematic progeny is the only real path to canonical status, George Romero's stature should be enhanced by _28 Days Later_.  Jim wanderings through the empty city evoke _Day of the Dead_.  A gleeful supermarket visit parallels the mall-plundering in _Dawn of the Dead_.  The structure is fundamentally similar to _Dawn of the Dead_: the middle part of the movie is relatively peaceful, with four characters creating their own makeshift family amidst the ruins of the world.  As in _Dawn of the Dead_, that peace is disrupted, but not by monsters.Zombies are the empty vessels of horror.  They don't have pre-set personalities and built-in themes, like sultry, oversexed vampires or snarling, beast-within-man werewolves.  They depend on their filmmakers for purpose, and they can express an incredibly wide variety of themes.  Maybe that's why zombies have had greatest success outside the Hollywood mainstream: Romero didn't answer to Hollywood execs, and Sam Raimi made the first two _Evil Dead_ movies for cheap long before _Spider-Man_.  Even within the same trilogy, Romero uses zombies in different ways, focusing on different themes in each film.  Compared to these films, or to _28 Days Later_, a standard-issue Hollywood horror hackfest can look pretty soulless. Hopefully, the next Hollywood stab at the subgenre will look more like _28 Days Later_ than _Resident Evil_._28 Days Later_ isn't perfect.  A few of the best scare scenes are set up in contrived ways.  Jim's endgame strategy seems poorly considered.  Boyle avoids the kitsch of the subgenre, but contrivance is arguably a worse sin. His style is often too MTV for my taste; some fights with the infected subscribe to the `shock and confuse' school of editing.  Boyle's greatest weakness is that he tends to machine-gun themes at you.  His theme explicating is often labeled as pretentious; I'd guess that it's not pretentiousness that motivates these didactic bits, but worry that the audience won't know how to feel about the film without them.  He should trust his audience more.The flaws of _28 Days Later_ are clear, but they don't negate the accomplishment.  Atmosphere, character, and storytelling get the attention they deserve.  The end results make for great horror, and will stay in this viewer's dreams for a while yet.",28 Days Later...
1057,dekdc,Excellent,10,4 July 2003,"This film is exactly what I wanted to see. Anyone who dismisses the movie because it isn't a zombie film (which it isn't, technically) or because it's too slow clearly doesn't enjoy being thrilled.Unlike so many modern Hollywood (read: Dimension Films) scary movies, 28 Days Later does not use a thrashing metal soundtrack, lots of gore, or any over-the-top monsters to scare you. The beauty of this movie (like any classic) is that it allows you to scare yourself. The director seems to understands that it's the sense of fear and hopelessness and uncertainty that creates tension, and this tension allows viewers to become more engaged with the film.The use of sound in the movie is incredible, and the timing is wonderful. I couldn't have been more please with 28 Days Later, and I can honestly say it's one of my favorite all-time scary movies (alongside Night of the Living Dead, some of the Fulci films, Ravenous, and others).",28 Days Later...

The cinematography was up there with ""Black Hawk Down,"" which, isn't a great movie by itself, but the symbolism and angles of the shots was incredible.""28 Day's Later,"" alone, as a story was great because the story never ended when you thought it would.  It stimulated thought, fear, suspense, sadness, joy... a full gamut of emotions.  I left the movie theatre completely satisfied with this movie, which hasn't happened in a very, very long time.The sound track was perfectly in synch with the movie, featuring ""Godspeed you Black Emperor!,"" an incredible band.  The music definitely added a heightened sense of thrill for this movie.If you didn't like movies that were suspenseful, and unique like ""12 monkeys"" or ""Fight Club,""  and beautiful and thought-provoking like ""A beautiful mind,"" perhaps this summer, you'd ought to stick to something less intrusive, and mature.

1059,RazziDazzi,Shockingly stupid film. Here's why... (SPOILERS),1,6 July 2003,"Bad horror films tend to hit bottom when their characters make idiotic choices and leave the audience scratching their head wondering, `why the hell he do that?'  By this standard, 28 DAYS LATER. plummets to bottom of the bad movie barrel.  Rarely have  film characters made such consistently, stupefying decisions.  Skip this flick unless you're meeting with friends, have a couple of beers, and want an impromptu session of  Mystery Science Theater 3000.Okay, how dumb are the characters?  Let's start.  (SPOILER ALERT AGAIN)-- Our lead Female finds a guy who just woke up from a coma, so at night when the Infected roam, she goes to sleep and lets him stand guard. without telling him not to light candles as they will attracted the Infected.-- So he lights the candle, not being bright enough himself to see the danger.  Then he starts watching video tapes!!!  (Where the hell is the electricity coming from!!!??)  The Infected see the light and attack. What a surprise.  As a result, she has to murder her partner. By this point, you wish she was dead too.-- Next, they find the Father and his Daughter.  The Father is extremely cautious guarding his child, wears goggles and layered clothing to protect against accidental infection (as did our two initially survivors).  But protective clothing is too intelligent a response so our characters promptly abandon the idea and go on a road trip sans any protective gear.  And what do you know.Father gets infected when accidentally blood drops into his eyes.  He's killed.  Boy, I didn't see that twist coming.  Guess, if he wore protective gear like he did in the beginning of the film, we wouldn't have this `twist'.But I'm getting ahead of myself as more idiocy abounds prior to Father's death.--  Our merry crew of four has to get to Manchester, and keep in mind that the Infected tend to roam in the darkness.  So what do they do.. Take a dark tunnel short cut!  Who's idea is this idiocy.. The father, who before was so cautious with his daughter's safely, but now's he's feeling. I guess. lucky. Well, the decision almost costs them their lives when the get a flat tire in the tunnel (guess you did see that `twist' coming either).--  Next comes the stop at the supermarket.  Are our foursome quick in restocking their supplies and moving on.  Nope, they play, quibble about alcohol.. It's not like the sun is setting because next, they.-- have a picnic!!!!  Out in the open!  How dumb can you get?!?!  Then instead of racing to the refuge in Manchester, they have a leisurely walk! Guess it helps the digestion.-- Now these amateur idiots go for pro status by spending the night. out in the OPEN WITH A CAMPFIRE ABLAZE!!  (didn't some one get killed when the infected were attracted by a candle!)This idiocy continues.  People in the theater are starting to laugh by now. I'll spare you more of this mirth, but I got to mention one supremely, idiotic move by our hero.  How does he rescue the two girls from the mansion???  BY UNLEASHING AN INFECTED SOLDIER  INTO THE BUILDING!!!!!!!!! Well, the infection spreads and nearly kills our gals!!!  I'm ready to throw popcorn at the screen by this point.  What a moron this guy is!  And every assault gun he finds. he leaves behind, cause using his thumbs ( I kid you not) is so much more effective.AHHHHHH!!!!!  And the damn story moves at a snail's pace!",28 Days Later...
1060,raypatnaude,"An intelligent, well-crafted horror film...",8,13 July 2003,"The trailer from 28 Days Later makes the film look like a remake of The Omega Man, which starred Charlton Heston as the last man on earth, save for a handful of Survivors and many many nocturnal zombies. It looked like a shameless remake, in fact, seemingly counting on enough time having passed that no one would notice the similarities- the apocalyptic plague, the number and race and gender of the survivors, the nature and appearance of the Zombies. As a fan of the zombie genre, and of the post-apocalyptic genre, I noticed, and was very disappointed that the guy who brought me Trainspotting had sunk this low as to do a remake of the Omega Man without even billing it as such. At least Ridley Scott upcoming remake is using the original novel's title, ""I am legend"". But I was wrong. It's not Omega Man Redux, it has it's own original story which is among the best in its genres. It references the Living Dead films, especially the best of that series, Dawn of the Dead, and the darkest of the series, Day of the Dead. In the postapocalyptic genre, it references the best of the 1980's :the the underrated 1985 film Night of the Comet, and the art-house version of the same year, The Quiet Earth. It also references the post-nuclear-war films of that decade: despite the title, not so much The Day After, more like the far more human version:Testamtent, and the far more depressing British version:Threads. Thus it draws form the best of each genre, mixing them together to somehow form a tru;ly scary, unsettling, creepy, bleak, yet fun film. And moreover it does this while remaining only very slightly postmodern- cynical, but never tongue-in cheek liek the characters in Kevin Williamson films who have to beat us over the head with how aware they are of the conventions of their genre. The best line of the film, the last woman on earth to the last man: ""So what do you want, then Jim? For us to find a cure and save the world? Or just fall in love and f***?"" The heroes are likeable, and you root for them and feel for themm when they die or turn into zombies. The villains are fleshed out- but just enough to be a little sympathtic and realistic. That goes for the humans villains, who ultimately are just trying to survive- and the zombies, all of whom can be seen to have varying degrees of resistance to their carnivorous nature, based on the strength of their character. Visually, the film tries to scare you in the usual horror film ""it was just a cat"" ways, but it also tries a few smore subtle tricks with the film stock to overcome the film's fantastic subject matter and draw the audience into beleiving this is real. While much of the film is shot on what appears to be 8 or 16mm, which makes it look like more of a documentary, it avoids the Blair Witch-style hand held shots, favoring an unusually static camera with unusal, unsettling, almost random composition in the frame, giving the feel of the action having been caught on hundreds of Englands security cameras, and edited together from that. I cannot recommend this film highly enough to fans of the zombie, post-apocalyptic, or last-man-on-earth sub-genres- it rivals the best, and I recommend it strongly to all others who happen to enjoy an intelligent, well-crafted horror film.",28 Days Later...

1063,seemantics,what the @#&$?,3,19 July 2003,"I will try not to give too much away about the movie, but there aren't many twists in the plot anyway.
I had high expectations going into this movie, primarily because IMDB indicated a very high rating.However, I found the film to be poorly made.I thought the characters were inconsistent, or evolving too fast for me to comprehend--Selena was initially a cold, impersonal soldier who hacked her close friend, Mark, then out of no where she delivers an untimely peck on Jim's cheek, then she breaks down and cries when the little girl's father is killed.I thought the movie could have been more interesting as a mystery (of course I'm no director) but Boyle gave us the entire story from the beginning. I think if they just postponed the initial laboratory/monkey rescue scene till later, the film would have had an awesome beginning with Jim wondering around trying to figure what's going on as the audience is also trying to grasp the storyline. But instead, we are forced to sit waiting, not for the storyline, but simply the blood and gore to come.I thought the movie raised a lot of interesting issues. You can read about many of them in the other user comments. But I feel that's all it did. It raised them. Then it left them alone. For example, there's something to consider in how we define the new family institution; how we rebuild the human race with nine men; does it become a moral duty for women to bare the next generation of the species? I felt Boyle lead me to discover these issues, but bullets and zombies quickly killed off the artifacts of this discovery. His answer was a removal of the question in the first place.Lastly, I didn't find it very scary at all, though this is entirely a matter of opinion. It certainly shouldn't be hailed as the scariest film since the Exorcist.Overall, I thought the title accurately reflects the movie. ""28 Days Later"". Why not ""27 Days Later""? or ""29 Days Later""? They show this phrase twice. But what's the significance...? It seemed totally arbitrary, much like the actions of the characters and scenes in the movie.
Lingering questions:1) Why was it safe to travel in the day? Did Boyle ever tell us why zombies cannot expose themselves to the day? Or was it just simply scarier? I still think he owes us an explanation for this. In the end, we do see the military aircraft fly over two zombies in broad daylight. They seemed to be in great pain, they seemed to have lost their Rage. Was this due to the sunlight? Or is this an indication of the starving zombies?2) Does it make sense that our three survivals are hailing a military aircraft? Aren't they afraid of a repeat scenario? What makes them think this new military unit won't use the women as concubines? Or are we to believe that Jim will be able to pull off yet another impossible rescue mission?",28 Days Later...

1068,mmiller_27,So dumb it's scary,3,4 August 2003,"This film was extremely disappointing. The initial scene barely sets up the context of the remaining 2 hours. What we see is a lab full of chimps watching disturbing violent images on tv screens. An group of activists bust in and attempt to free the monkeys, only to be told by an unfortunate scientist that the monkeys are infected with rage. At that moment, a female activist is attacked by a freed chimp, and begins throwing up blood. What was the nature of the infection? How was it administered? How did it spread?
We are left to assume the progression of events, as the initial scene cuts to a naked man lying in a hospital bed in deserted London. Who is he? Why is he not infected? What part does he play? Only later do we find out he was just a patient in the hospital. This happens throughout the movie: no supporting information to help guide the story along.Maybe that is the effect the director was going for. However in the first ending, we see a British jet fly overhead, and can't help but wonder, ""where did they come from?"" as everyone had been touted as dead throughout the film. Too many unanswered questions and a lack of creepiness with the so-called zombies made this movie nothing more than a British art film with a lot of unrecognized potential.",28 Days Later...
1069,A-Bomb,Best film of the summer,9,11 August 2003,"Speaking as someone who was raised on horror films, 28 Days Later is definitely more then your average gore fest. 28 Days Later is the best film of the summer thanks to the great acting of the entire cast (especially Cillian Murphy and Brendan Gleeson), a great plot and wonderful cinematography. In one of the opening scenes rather then just telling the audience that London is deserted, the director Danny Boyle actually showed them with stunning establishing shots.Aside from just being a great film, 28 Days Later raised an interesting question about society. Within a month of the new society being formed by a group of soldiers, it had begun to repeat the same flaws as the old society. This can be illustrated by the attempted rape of Selena and Hannah and the attempted murder of Jim.Another great touch on the part of the film makers was the idea of having the virus totally take control of the victim within 20 seconds, leaving out the tired old plot twist of having a main character infected but not telling the other members of the surviving group.Like any film there were some problems, mainly the lack of information given to the audience about the virus, but since the story is told through people with little information themselves one could argue that the audience was given as much information as the people trying to survive. All things considered, this was a great film and I think that once this summer is over people will look back and realize that it was the best picture of the summer and the best horror film in years.",28 Days Later...

The scenes where the main character wanders around London by himself, in the church where the infected priest comes after him, arms jerking and flailing, in the stairwell on the way to the top apartment, and in the tunnel when the tire was being changed on the car, each of these was terrifying in its own right. In some of the scenes, I was reminded of The Omega Man with Charlton Heston, another ""zombie"" film where the zombies didn't eat their victims, but used night-time to hunt down the non-zombies. Another scary film. I found myself watching 28 Days Later and thinking, this could happen.

1073,LindaRups,Terrifying film,8,14 September 2003,"When I heard about this movie I really wanted to see it because of its (almost) unique concept. But it was a lot scarier that I expected it to be.You see a guy waking up (from a coma?) in a completely empty hospital, he walks out (really healthy looking except for his haircut) and still can't find one human soul. When he walks into a church he sees lots of people lying there and when he says 'Hello' some raging person runs upstairs towards him (sorry for my bad English) screaming and almost attacking. When he runs out of the church there are a couple of infected people running after him. From there you know this is not gonna be a fun movie to watch.I think the music was really excellent, it gave the particular scene a boost. When you see an infected person the frames are quicker or something, what makes it even more frightening. The actors, especially the infected ones were really 'real' and the whole movie had this vibe of survival in a dangerous world.

There were some interesting parts where the movie takes a different turn but it is done very well. Fitting more in the action/suspense category, fans of horror films might be left desiring more gore and scarier, ""jump out of your seat,"" scenes. However they shouldn't be too disappointed, as there is plenty of biting, slashing, and blood to keep us watching.  Anyone who enjoyed the Resident Evil video game series will definitely love this movie.Recommended.",28 Days Later...

What I really enjoyed in the beginning was of course the empty streets, one man, not knowing what has happened. It kind of reminds me of the movies ""The Quiet Earth"" and ""Day of the Triffids"" where you also have this ""All alone in the World"" thing going on.Of course when the ""infested"" show up, that's when all the fun starts.I can recommend this movie to anyone who's into horror.

I watched it hoping it was going to get more enjoyable after the first 15mins, but it got worse and worse. A lot of very dark scenes hard to see, and throughout the whole film very quick sceneshots enough to invoke epilepsy. It got more and more boring and I really couldn't give a damn who got killed. I wish the Zombies had wiped out the whole cast and crew who worked on it! The best part of it for me was seeing Westminster etc rather empty during the day, which I hear was quite easy to do anyway. Swearing was at a mind numbing maximum, like some cheap trash movie trying to cash in on the fact that you can see it at the cinema or on DVD with lots of swearing whereas on TV especially in North America, everything is sanitized and sterile. This film was made by morons for morons, and I resent the time it took to watch the damn thing. Simply not in the same class as Trainspotting. I give it a 2/10.

1078,factionparadoxuk,What Zombie Films should aspire too . .,10,29 December 2003,"No Spoilers contained within!This film works well, the acting is of a high quality, and it scares appropriately. Where this film really excels though is in its presentation of the characters. The film invites its audience to sympathise with the main protagonists, enables the viewer to feel the despair and encroaching madness that such a horrific event would bring to bear on any left surviving. The society left behind after this amazing event has evidently been thought about a little more than most - the audience are presented with those who choose to live alone - those who have resorted to staying in large groups - many different ways of coping from giving up to almost ignorance of what has happened. The score to the film guides the emotion also, one standout moment in the film was when the little girl witnessed *that* - it felt so real, so gut wrenchingly soul-destroying - complemented by superb directing and an emotive score.Basically the best advice to give for a film that seems to split opinion like this is to just go and buy it for yourself - make up your own mind. I like to think of it as a moder-day version of Dawn of the Dead - so if you like that then maybe you'll like this - but who knows? :)",28 Days Later...

It opens with a chimp who is been ""tortured"" by watching like 8 television sets portraying human crowds on strike. As if the thing was scary or something (?). Think cheap ""Clockwork Orange for Monkeys"" and you are there.Then some ecologist jerks go and free the monkeys-- to end their endless TV suffering I presume. But, regrettably, one of them (of the monkeys) seems to be infected with a virus or something and transmits it to the jerks. The virus makes you go nuts and byte everyone around, be they people, monkeys or whatever.The infection process takes like 1 second (?) and when you get it you are displayed on screen as if you were being recorded with a fast-shutter camera (like in ""Saving Private Ryan""). I keep wondering if that is supposed to be scary or is it just that they bought the camera and had to use it to justify the purchase :-)Anyway, if you don't find that stupid opening scene funny enough, wait until the main character opens his mouth. He is such a lame actor you won't believe he got to play the main part. Its performance is even more ridiculous if you happen to see the dubbed Spanish version of the movie, in which the voice of this guy sounds as if he is retarded. I can't believe this wasn't done on purpose =:'-DWell, then there are lots of stupid situations, but I won't bother commenting on them. Just your average standard-substandard ""scary"" moments and those oh-no-don't-do-that ""thrilling"" set-ups.So, in summary, if you enjoy cheap b-movies and have nothing better to do, you can give it a try and have some bored laughs.",28 Days Later...

I knew the plot outline so I was not surprised that the protagonist emerged into an empty city. HOWEVER, the constant attacks by groups of infecteds did surprise me. I like logic in plot development, no matter the genre, and what I found illogical and annoying was that the infecteds were not attacking one another. After all, they had a virus which gave them uncontollable rage. This rage should have been directed at everyone and everything. Also, after 28 days of this London would have been a charnal house, with decomposing bodies all over the place, but perhaps the budget did not permit it.",28 Days Later...

1086,mybluepillchick,asthetically beautiful and entertaining,10,27 February 2004,"this is the first movie i'm rating on imdb because i think it deserves enormous praise.  in my opinion as a student who studies media arts, it is the best movie to come out in the last 3 years at least.the movie, like any other, isn't without faults, but they are largely too insignificant to detract from this brilliant movie.most people know danny boyle is a highly regarded director, but he also lucked out in other areas with this movie.  the most important aspect of a work of art will always be the substance, the content.  28 days later is grounded in an exciting and emotional plot.  i thought it was also clever that the makers included 2 filmed endings and 1 storyboard ending.  this way, people that liked the movie and didn't like the way a certain ending sat with them, could watch another one.  if a viewer doesn't like the ending of a movie for some reason or another, it will often put a bad taste in their mouth when reflecting on the movie as a whole.  the plot is untraditional in its organization giving it more interest.  unlike most movies being made right now, the beginning is relatively slow and still, a nice change.  Viewer interpretation is in the forefront instead of concrete plot turns.  on being a horror movie:  this is not your typical horror movie.  there's relatively little gore, but it's scarier than many recent horror movies because of the combined effects of great camera work, unconventional movement and interesting settings.  one of my favorite things boyle does in his movies is he brings it down to a very human, tangible, realistic level.  at one point, jim has to shave without water, and viewers feel his pain and unhappiness.  boyle also seems to love juxtaposition. (examples are the christmas lights in the middle of disheveled london, the countryside where they sleep vs. the city, the red dresses inside the evil, dark house.)  i really like the symbolism used (""HELL...HELP"", white horses)--they hit you much harder than any other method can.  you get a very organic understanding and construction of the emotions of the characters. you'll be surprised how your feelings about jim change from the beginning from the movie to the end.  boyle knows when to follow the rules and when to break them.  one of the rules that is used because it WORKS is the struggle between good and evil.  you know it's being traditional as you watch certain parts of the movie, but you LIKE it.  certain parts closer to the end are conciously traditional (rain when jim struggles). i personally liked the ""damsel in distress"" feeling near the end of the movie.  that motif emotionally satisfies something in the average viewer.  in the end, most women want to be protected because they are loved.  most men like feeling of being needed and being the hero.  enough of that.  those are the highpoints of the plot, characters, story.
the cast for this movie is perfect.  i had never heard of any of the actors before the movie, but they are far more talented than many run-of-the-mill actors.  boyle was smart to cast appealing looking, but not ""pretty"" people. this makes for a more realistic and engaging movie.almost everyone who watches this movie is astonished by the beautiful, powerful, interesting camera work.  you can look up the guy's name on the 28 days later website.  without those shots, this movie would not be the work of art many people consider it to be.  certain shots are incredibly lonely and cold, others are terrifying.  it's a visually exciting movie to watch.
you have to see it to believe it.",28 Days Later...

1088,Jake_MABS,28 Days Later - A lesson in Horror.,9,8 October 2007,"The brilliantly directed Danny Boyle film '28 Days Later' started as a little known film circulating cinemas across the country. Through word of mouth and the critically acclaimed director Danny Boyle the film started to get the recognition it deserved. The mixture of superb cinematography and unique camera angles give this horror film an 'arty' edge which in my opinion put's this horror film a cut above most others. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's (Author of 'The Beach' and 'The Tesseract') adaptation of the rage filled zombie's is also a welcome relief from our stereotypical brain dead, gormless zombie's that appear in films such as 'Resident Evil' and 'Land of the Dead, with the horror being generated from a mass epidemic spreading across a country and maybe the world. The acting within the film is well thought out (with some exceptions) with clever casting of Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and Brendan Gleeson all with staring roles and all have gone on to other big Hollywood movies, the only down side is the acting of Brendan Gleesons daughter who's acting can only be described as terrible. Overall the breath of fresh air that '28 Days Later' brought to the zombie/horror sub genre was almost a rejuvenation for zombie films. The mix of clever directing and sheer terror seen throughout the film makes it without doubt my favourite horror film, above titles such as ""The Shining', 'Halloween'' and 'The Exorcist'. This could be to do with the fact that i am English and have enjoyed all of Danny Boyle's previous film, but all the same this is a film i would fully advice anyone to see.",28 Days Later...
1089,Puxie,I had to own it!,10,7 February 2004,"There are a gazillion light-years between british/european and hollywood film-making so there is absolutely no way to compare this film with anything hollywood-ish. The acting is different, the cultural differences very clear which might make it too strange for your mainstream audience, but in reality it was a VERY well done movie which made up for the lack of plot (still not too much of a lack - reality is MUCH stranger than fiction) in every other aspect.I liked it much more for the characters and the scenery etc than for the zombie-factor, which was kept at a very reasonable level. It wasn't the MAIN plot - the main plot was about the few survivors and what happens to them in an almost unthinkable situation.Great movie!",28 Days Later...

1091,NapoleanWilson,Exemplary film making,10,19 January 2005,"Dawn of the Dead, The Omega Man, Night of the Living Dead. They all pale in comparison.This film should be shown to every student studying Film as an example of how it is done. Full stop.Some of the shots and camera angles are genuinely thrilling. The whole film could be played out as a series of still frames with no sound as each shot is fresh, imaginative and tells us a little bit more about the story, the characters or the situation.Although it may sound as if the whole film is based on superficial shots that are there to please the eye, it is certainly not the case. It is impossible to point out any aspect of the film that is a let down.The acting is real quality, Cillian Murphy gives an utterly convincing performance as Jim who is trying to come to terms with the situation he finds himself in, making even the line, ""Hello"", memorable! Naomie Harris puts in a real composed and confident turn. But the man who really stands out in this film for me is Brendan Gleeson, he really is a cracking actor, he plays 'Frank' with so much warmth that you genuinely care for him. The three characters (and the actors) along with Frank's daughter really work well together.The sound is amazing, the accurate choice of music for each scene can be compared to that of ""The Shining"". The quality of the overall sound (music and effects) are top notch.Overall, the film is an unbelievable example of sheer quality coming together to create a film that, over time, will prove to be legendary.

1092,knoxproductions01,Review on 28 days later by me,7,22 January 2013,"Danny Boyle's film 28 days later is about an infection that spreads across the nation, all starting from people rescuing chimpanzees from being tested in labs, from that, the infections unravels into being a few people to eventually almost everyone infected. I found the film enjoyable with more twist and turns then I was expecting. What lacked in the film for me was strong visuals and film work, I understood the filming techniques that were done and why for example the reputation of speed up zombies when they came into the scenes, where to add fear and tension but It really didn't work. Along with the zombies I found there was no shots in the film that left me thinking that looks great or that's so well done. Luckily I found the storyline interesting and kept me on edge a lot of time. Even though Im not the biggest zombie fan ( apart from Walking Dead ) I did like this film, I think it could of been a lot better with better shots but overall it was a decent film. I give it 7.",28 Days Later...
1093,Mekul,Good TV show episode,8,3 January 2006,"For me this was one of the most overrated movies I've seen in a while. I'd heard good things about it and gave it a go. I thought the first half was great but once they started the road trip to Manchester it lost all of its momentum. Some of the ""surprises"" in the plot were telegraphed as well - especially Frank's death and the phoniness of the broadcast from Manchester. The part with the soldiers would have made a really good episode of a TV show based on this story and characters. Whenever the ""ordinary guy defeats a whole heap of trained soldiers"" rubbish is rolled out I have to be skeptical. When this movie degenerated to that at the end I lost interest completely. The whole premise of rounding up the women struck me as stupid too and I expect a lot better from a writer as talented as Alex Garland. Overall I was hoping for more answers and resolution and instead got a well made TV show. Well-written and well-acted but still - a TV show.",28 Days Later...
1094,davidmcginley1,"A brilliant, genuinely scary film.",9,27 April 2012,"28 Days Later is probably one of the best horror movies of all time. The characters were realistic people I cared for, and I was actually worried for them - at certain points, I really thought something terrible could happen to them. Cillian Murphy (Jim), Christopher Eccleston (Major Henry West), Naomie Harris (Selena) and the rest all give amazing performances, really showing how well they can all act. Probably one of the best parts of the entire film though is the soundtrack. The main theme (I think it's called ""In a Heartbeat"", but I'm not sure) is brilliant, and whoever composed that music is a genius. I'm not an expert on films (or anything, really) but this is definitely something worth watching, if you haven't already.",28 Days Later...
1095,ventilashyn,Go to sleep...,2,31 October 2012,"One of the most slow-moving movies I have ever watched. I tried watching this movie with a friend, hoping that some of the stellar user reviews and the general score it has on IMDb are correct. I was completely let-down. I don't know what about this movie is supposed to be so good. Is it the emptiness? The sense of nihilism? What? I am not a big fan of slow-moving cinema but I do appreciate when it's done well, to the advantage of thorough character development. I speak of films like 'Gattaca' or the Coen brothers' 'The Man Who Wasn't There'. These films are not heavy on the special effects - there aren't many explosions and such but I've never watched and yawned. This, on the other hand, had my head drooping within the first 45-minutes.I feel like it would have been better done as a book.A mediocre production with badly rendered cinematography. You would be better served watching something else if you don't want to fall asleep. I do not recommend this.",28 Days Later...
1096,Cinepierre,"The most logical horror film I know. (Beware, behind you : BIG SPOILERS !!!!)",8,12 August 2004,"I really liked ""28 days later"". For the first time in an horror movie I believe in the characters. usually, there are always people chased by the villain who take the wrong way, react the most silly way and finally.. get killed (or get saved by another hero without explanations).In this film, the characters seemed ""real"" to me. They act and react like you and me could act and react in those kind of situation. There is no big hero, there are humans afraid and fighting for there lives.When the two young heroes meet the father and his daughter, a kind of family link is created. I found this part very sweet in this horror mood, together they are able to face their destiny.But the arrival in this army camp destructs this feeling of ""together we are stronger"" because, unfortunately, the soldiers are really human too ! They want to have fun, they need to rape the two poor girls. And Even though it is unforgivable, this is terribly understandable ! They are men. They are alone. They have no future. They deserve to die. But...The moment when I stop following the hero, Jim, is when he kills all the soldiers one by one. The first murders are forgivable : he wants to save the girls. But the last one he kills, he kills him like if he were a zombie himself. I was thinking : okay, the message is, whatever you are infected or not, when you are a killer, when you get used to blood, you're not a human any more. But I guess I was wrong, because of the romantic and happy end... Jim is shown like a regular nice man, the hero of the movie. And that is weird because, for me, He crossed the line : he became too much violent, a part inside him is ""zombie"" for ever...But, even if the end is going a little too far for me, I really enjoyed this movie.Thank you for reading me, sorry for the English mistakes I could have done.",28 Days Later...

They are not the reanimated dead, they are infected living people. Stop calling it a zombie film and pay attention to the story. I'm no critic nor do I pretend to be but at least I know what this excellent film is actually about. Yes, it has touches of the Romero type zombie films, and yes, there are questionable zombie references in its pretty good sequel (the scene where the helicopter kills a load of the infected springs to mind, with some of the infected still raging on after losing limbs, guts, etc) but at its heart and sequel aside this was a film about an epidemic and not of the walking dead kind.",28 Days Later...
1098,RadiatorPie,Surprising,8,3 July 2004,"Prior to watching this film, I had seen countless poor horror films that I had almost given up on the genre. I had seen this film advertised though and seeing it was a British film I decided to 'give it a go' so to speak. I am so glad I did.The film itself brings out a whole new light to the traditional zombie horror films over the years. Granted the film isn't really a true zombie film as the victims are subject of a disease rather than just rotting corpses but they have the same lust for blood as other films portray.Keeping a film like this fresh is a tough achievement but this film is boosted by fast-moving zombies and a great feeling of loneliness which lingers throughout the film making this film one to think about as well as just to watch.All in all this is a great, fast-paced horror film and by far one of the best of its type to emerge over the past few years.

When a movie is done well, parts that are really far fetched aren't that noticeble b/c people are willing to accept the impossible for the sake of the story... When you watch this movie, even those that might for some reason enjoy it, you'll find yourself asking how unlikely it is that things that happen in the movie will actually happen given the situation... This is an evidence of badly written and badly directed movie... The creator of this movie disregard the sophistication of human understanding of science and morals and they try to reinvent scientific knowledge and reteach the morals that people are already aware of... Because of this, the movie reaches beyond our suspension of disbelief and becomes absurd and the critical plot becomes redundant because we have heard it many times before, which is that we are our own worst fears...The story was not only horrible, but it was also going no where.. When the story becomes complicated and reaches climax of confrontation with no sight of easy resolution for the director; He does what is easy for him by stopping the story in the middle of crisis, move the time along 28 days later and people are suppose to accept that everything has turned out fine...

The infection is known as ""rage"", which is a human emotion, and everyone in the film is looking for what to do next while dealing with emotions of sadness and fear. Having said this, it is very well done as a thriller on it's own as I would find myself pretty freaked out by everything going on. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, as it is shot with digital cameras which according to the filmmaker were used to bring out an ""urban"" feel to the film, and it works very well. The movie is made in such a real way, and I believe there were hardly any special effects used, if any at all. The music of the film always supplies additional emotions to add to the situation, and makes you wonder if there is any hope for the characters. This film is absolutely amazing as it supplies thrills and a very intriguing story, and I suggest it to anyone.

The fact that they didn't use 35mm cameras but DV gave an eerie look and feel to the film. There are many twists and turns that will blow your mind and get your heartbeat racing. The soundtrack of the movie is the best they could have used (In a Heartbeat - John Murphy) and even listening to it after you've watched the movie is frightening. Finally the script and performances are excellent and no wonder the movie got 25 academy award nominations. Though I am not a fan of the genre this is a must watch film that you shouldn't miss out on and it shows a lot about humans' true nature. If you're thinking about watching it, do it in a very dark room, with headphones and make sure no light or sound can be seen or heard from outside the room....~25 minutes into the movie you'll get why...( An as another previewer said it is so good a horror movie, that in the end you feel physically exhausted)Spoiler: The actor playing the Captain always plays negative characters and I was hoping for once he would play the good guy, so it's a mild disappointment",28 Days Later...

I'm a fan of Zombie movies ever since saw my first one when I was about eleven years old and watched Night of the living Dead back in '71 or '72. This film imprinted itself on me and scared me so badly that I kept my parents awake for several nights after, and they kept me from going to horror films for two years.

Before I saw the film, I was expecting a movie along the lines of ""Resident Evil"", but I noticed both movies are very different. Danny Boyle did a wonderful job in portraying the struggle of survival of helpless people from the rage-filled infected. The cinematography was fantastic; especially the usage of a digital video camera, which gave it an urban and gritty look, that accommodated to the desolate and grey city of London. The movie is very appealing. This movie is definitely one of my top favorites. Cillian Murphy and Naomi Harris did absolutely wonderful jobs.",28 Days Later...
1108,brawne,The Day of the Triffids,10,24 January 2005,"I was researching info. re: The Day of the Triffids and came across an interesting comparison of this book to 28 Days Later (NB - am not making any reference to the disastrous cinematic attempt). The Day of the Triffids is such a classic Sci Fi novel - 50 years strong - and it was pleasantly surprising to see an edgy movie like 28 Days presumably use so much of Wyndham's material (eg: entire opening sequence).Although 28 Days had got all the makings of a Zombie Flick with its portents of apocalyptic doom, the message is arguably more than this. In The Day of the Triffids, the main story is not so much about the uprising of walking, carnivorous plants as placing more importance on how the survivors respond to the end of the world as we know it. At what lengths will groups of people will go to, to reforge something that is lost? How can 'normal' society be recreated in the context of what has happened? Although Wyndham is able to go into these questions in some detail (he wrote a book), 28 Days attempts to address these issues too, notably when Jim and his crew meet up with the major's lot.The Day of the Triffids was read post-28 Days, and it was this book that helped me view the film in a bright new light",28 Days Later...
1109,Strife778,A wonderful social commentary... with zombies!,10,16 April 2005,"First off I would like to say that I thought this movie was excellent, and I'm not usually a fan of the zombie flick. However this movie was quite different. More terrifying than the zombies was the hard-hitting, all too true social commentary that the movie contained.The movie is set in england which is perfect because; being and island, it give the distinct feeling of a microcosm of society, rather a smattering of parts of the whole. Being set on an island it give the viewer the ability to take a sterilized view to the carnage, with the rational as that of a scientist viewing a controlled experiment.The film superficially touches on the topics of love and family, but the deeply ingrained undertone is that: no matter the carnage that is done to humans, it only parallels the destruction that we wreck upon ourselves. The use of an onslaught of zombies is brilliant. We see the characters plagued by these enraged zombies WHO USED TO BE HUMAN(hint.. that is important) and then we see their interaction with the soldiers from the blockade and we see that the interaction is at its core... the same.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, however i suggest not watching it in a dark basement at 3:47 a.m. as you will find it hard to sleep :) The important thing to take away from this film is the idea the no matter what is done to humanity, we continue to do worse to ourselves.",28 Days Later...
1110,leatherrebel74,Real bad. A pure waste of time.,1,22 February 2005,"WARNING: INCLUDES SPOILERS! Advertised as ""scary as hell"", supposedly a horror-suspense movie, has little horror, barely any suspense, and is not a movie by any standard. The thing closest to ""horror"" in this uh, sub-flick is the horrible English accent, often unintelligible. Some of the zombies were cool, especially the captive black guy in the soldier's mansion, and the two dying ones as the plane flies, toward the end. Put aside all the plot holes - or rather the single hole which is the whole plot-, and the strong left-wing bias present in nearly every movie nowadays, this movie is plain boring and idiotic. I wasted one hour and 48 minutes of my life watching this garbage. The first 15 mins were OK, but from the minute Jim wakes up it was a disaster. As he walks on the dead London streets there's some nice music, which could as well been ""hop goes the weasel"". The minute Selena and Mark appear, it becomes obvious that Mark will die and Jim and Selena will get together. Then, as they meet Frank and Anna, it is immediately obvious that Frank will die. They could have made it much more morbid and gut-wrenching, for example if Hanna would have become infected and Frank had to kill her. The soldier's mansion was plain pathetic. The soldiers turned out to be evil monsters only interested in sex in such dire times. The colonel was plain evil, and they were so single dimensioned personalities you wouldn't even find in the White House. The ending was so horrendous that is not even worth being mentioned. All in all a bad movie, way too few gore and horror for such a movie. It probably flew only on the pretentious advertising campaign. Not recommended.",28 Days Later...
1111,solidus19,Brilliant modern horror film.,9,16 September 2006,"28 Days Later is the first horror film in quite some time to successfully combine the hyper-realistic neo-celluloid capabilities of HD with the blood gushing glory of 70's grindhouse cinema. This is largely due to the always excellent and under-appreciated direction of Danny Boyle, and a cast that successfully balances their performances with the post-apocalyptic nightmare setting and monsters of the film.Cillian Murphy is very impressive in a lead role that is usually underused in most of the older zombie films in order to put the focus on the carnage. He, along with the supporting cast, add the emotion and character development needed to make the battles for survival that much more important to the audience. And for most part, Boyle delivers the goods on both ends, never letting up on the action in a ravaged English wasteland and delivering the blood in cringe-inducing splendor, all in high resolution.While the ending feels a bit rushed, I was completely enthralled throughout the entire film, largely because I sincerely cared for the characters and their lives.Definitely do not miss out on this modern horror masterwork.9 out of 10.",28 Days Later...

The filming is superb and looking at a silent London - fantastic. Quite Wyndham-esqe, the idea of a post apocalyptic world (or is it) will always enthral. Highly recommended. If you want to watch a film that will keep you talking for days, if not weeks after, I'd recommend this one. Don't walk out of this one after 10 minutes.",28 Days Later...
1113,williambebb,Why it most definitely is a wonderful zombie film,8,10 January 2014,"Garland and Boyle created a wonderful post apocalyptic world filled with living, rage filled, homicidal zombies.*I doubt this message actually contains spoilers but better safe than sorry.Those who claim they couldn't be zombies might do well to acquaint themselves with a fairly extensive collection of films that predate even Night of The Living Dead in which the word zombie is frequently used in the titles. In the lexicon of common terminology there are TV zombies, internet zombies, texting zombies, smart phone zombies etc. They all fit a broad definition of people that have lost their self awareness and aren't using their brains- to one degree or another. In 28 Days Later the victims of the virus are not acting rationally, but rather have been reduced to an animal-like furious mental state which causes them to seek out and destroy/infect those that are different. The George Romero style undead type of zombie and the ones in 28 Days Later are in more ways similar than not. Having written several novels involving zombies, both undead and living insane ones, I feel arguing about what constitutes a 'true' zombie is a pointless thing until we someday find them roaming the streets outside our homes. In Valley of Death Zombie Trailer Park, a fairly well received FREE novel, there are actually both types mentioned above. A virus creates the maddened furious living zombies which when killed reanimate as the undead variety. 28 Days Later was a very good zombie film, but had the killed infected then reanimated and continued their antisocial behavior it probably would have been the best.",28 Days Later...

As a matter of fact, I rarely watch scary movies, so when I do I expect some moments of fear. I waited for those moments, and this suspense of suspected horror was the most intense feeling I got out of this movie(except for disgust). There was little action, little suspense, no zombies jumping out of nowhere, so I was bored. Every time a zombie attacked, the diagonal camera view illustrated the fact that it was coming.The beginning was good, and I felt drawn in by it at first. However it quickly got worse. This seemed to be a bad imitation of Dawn of the Dead. If you haven't seen Dawn of the Dead, watch it and don't waste you're time on this movie.

While it is not the best horror movie I've ever seen, it is one of the scariest, mainly because the ""zombies"" move faster (much faster) than uninfected humans. These super strong creatures intensify the nightmare factor. The movie also is supported by good acting on the part of Cilian Murphy and cast, as well as limited idle chatter (a problem for many horror movies). Again, the opening scene is quite laughable and there are a few minor plot holes, but after a few minutes, you'll get into it and your skin will start tingling.

1118,sgt_spigarelli,This explains why dirty hippies suck...,1,10 June 2005,"***WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** Obviously, I'm going to write a negative review here. Much of what I'd like to say already has been in the negative review section, so I'll get in some other points in addition to the old stand-by complaints.This is definitely the worst zombie movie I've ever seen. Some people may not like Resident Evil, but at least the T-Virus made sense in that movie. The Rage Virus is retarded. Why do the infected only attack non-infected? Why are the streets and highways almost entirely devoid of cars? Why would the Manchester fire drive the zombies out if they are attracted to light? There are so many common-sense aspects that are fouled up because the creators stretch suspension of disbelief miles beyond the breaking point.It was interesting for me to look at this movie from the point of view of a film student. At points, the acting was not too bad. There were some interesting camera angles, and I admire some of the imagery, but this makes the wastefulness of the film all the more apparent. I commend the film crew's ability to make a major city appear vacant. Unfortunately, I believe the reason the streets were shown so bare was as a way of showing off technical ability while it completely raped reality. You know what I call that? I call it a waste of money and special effects. The streets should have been crammed with cars filled with mutilated bodies. That would have shown off special effects and made much more sense.Many have complained that the movie is boring. If you realize this but can't quite place your finger on why, I'll tell you. Shot duration. The amount of time spent on looking at uninteresting things is unreal. This is one of the most elementary components to movie making, and apparently Danny Boyle just doesn't get it. IT'S BLOODY BORING TO WATCH SOME IDIOT WANDER AROUND THE STREETS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A ROOF FOR ABOUT 35 SECONDS, DANNY! Also the script was very poorly written. I'm not averse to movies that contain necessary cursing (such as in war movies and the like). But when 3/4 of a script is the F-word, it just sounds unintelligent and shoddy. The other quarter of the talking was either unoriginal story lines or someone mumbling such gems as: ""So, but... Um, yeah. Okay."" The real tragedy here is that now this concept has already been used. Even if someone would use the better ideas that formed part of the concept of the movie and made a good show with it, people would say that they were copying off this pile of crap.The only thing I learned is that enviro-wackos will be the death of us all.",28 Days Later...
1119,heypete,"Good cinematography, weak plot...",6,14 June 2005,"Although this movie is an interesting diversion for an hour or two, and a fairly good zombie flick, it's not a great movie.The movie starts out like any normal zombie movie, with the main character waking up in a completely abandoned city (think of how the first ""Resident Evil"" movie ends), meeting up with a small band of uninfected humans, and seeking shelter elsewhere. All this is well and good, though a bit slow -- London is completely empty, and the film demonstrates that abundantly through breathtaking wide-angle shots.Up until the point where the soldiers attempt to rape the female lead character and the young girl, everything was believable, though it left a few ""realistic"" concerns unaddressed (I'll address those later). Everything from that point on is just a bloodlust-filled rampage shot with grainy film (to good visual effect, but not terribly good in terms of plot), ending with a ""Sound of Music""-type perfect ending where a Finnish fighter jet notices the small group and signals for their rescue.Given that zombie movies are usually pretty cheesy, 28 Days Later was, for the most part, an enjoyable if somewhat bland movie. The last 30 minutes or so really ruined it, in my eyes, however.Being an individual who prepares for various emergencies (I live near a major earthquake fault in California, though I admit to being less-than-prepared for a full-out zombie invasion) and former US Army soldier, I had the following observations:1) With practically all of England infected, there is no facility for manufacturing ammunition, and certainly no importation of such. Why the British soldiers are so indiscriminate about full-auto fire when they believe the rest of the world is infected (and thus no hope of rescue) is beyond me. Shouldn't they be conserving their ammunition to make it last as long as possible?2) Why did it take 56 days for observation planes to arrive and start looking for survivors? While it's unlikely that other countries would immediately start sending in ground troops (for fear of infection), there's no reason why they shouldn't send observation planes to look at what's happening.3) Along the lines of #1, why did the British soldiers use their generator so much? They had a wood-burning boiler (where'd the water come from?), which made sense as they were in a wooded area and had plenty of fuel, but no resupply of gasoline or diesel. Even major internet data centers have only enough fuel for a week or two, certainly not 28 continuous nights, particularly so when they're hiding out in a captured mansion that doesn't have the existing infrastructure.4) It seems clear that zombies cannot climb sheer walls. Since the male lead character Jim had to scale a wall to flee the crazed soldiers, wouldn't it be fairly trivial to ensure that any breaches in the perimeter wall (gates, for example) were secured, and then clear all areas within the wall of zombies, thus being able to live in some degree of security? Additional reinforcement of the walls (perhaps with downward-pointing spikes, water-filled moats, or other barriers) could come later. Simply counting on all the zombies to come from one direction, crossing a minefield, and into your existing fields of fire (who's on duty all the time? There's not enough soldiers to stay awake 24 hours a day.) is rather silly from a tactical perspective.All right, enough nitpicking. As far as zombie movies go, this one's all right...but zombie movies aren't generally that great in the first place. Great visuals, good first 2/3rds of the film, terrible ending, and overall weak-to-moderate plot.",28 Days Later...

Still, it's a fine film and deserves most of the positive accolades it has received. It's easily one of the finest horror movies I've seen in ages.

1131,bosswilde,I like this film,10,30 May 2017,"28 weeks later is a post-apocalyptic film directed by Danny Boyle. One of my favorite paintings on the theme of a zombie Apocalypse. Watched the tape a dozen times, including all additional materials, both in Russian and in original language. To this day, for me, this movie and the sequel 28 weeks later, but it is a little bit later, is the standard zombie-genre world of film. The film is set in what was once an amazingly beautiful country with a rich history of great Britain, stricken with an incurable virus, leading to instant infection. Upon contact with a human, the virus turns them into insane killers.Unlike other films of this genre the infected are alive. They are fast, rabid, angry, hungry and insatiable creature. Danny Boyle opened a new world of ""living dead"" is not only world cinema but for the interactive entertainment industry. The second important fact is that the Director, in most cases, refused to computer graphics and hand-drawn special effects. Instead, the gallons of fake blood, tons of makeup, and many non-professional actors in the role of fast zombies.Happy in the movie and memorable music written by the British composer and musician John Murphy, which complements the atmosphere of despair, of madness, of fear and impending doom brings to us what words cannot, and most importantly, doesn't distract from the movie itself.I advise to all, this cult film from the famous Director, ushered in a new wave of zombie horror in world cinema",28 Days Later...

1133,macky_topsecret,I'm disappointed,5,16 November 2005,"Me and my sisters were kind of excited about 28 Days Later when we first saw its trailer. We thought that finally, there's a movie about zombies and biological epidemics that actually made sense. But we were highly disappointed when we finally saw its content.There are a lot of unexplained actions in scenes scattered throughout the movie. First let's get to the cause : a virus called ""rage"" which causes the infected to be well...enraged. But that's it, the infected are enraged, period. No more explanations (not even a scientific one), but in my opinion it's kind of senseless, a virus transmitted by blood, causes the infected to be enraged, it seems more likely that this concept be adapted to a psychological thriller movie. And transmission ""takes about 10-20 seconds""-according to the character of Selena, I don't think that a virus could blend with the blood in a very short span of time as that. The origin itself is very questionable, how could an ape in captivity forced to watch violent scenes from TVs harbor a virus transmitted by blood??? It seems quite impossible to me. The infected vomiting a mass of blood seems also baseless.The story is very short for me, not to mention that most of the scenes are not connected to each other. When Jim, Selena and Hannah found their way to a group of soldiers who promised a cure, Jim finds out that these soldiers only wanted women to have sex with, because they're stressed out with the situation. I mean, that's one big leap from the big problem of infection. And I think that the word ""infection"" is inappropriate an overused.Not to mention that there are a lot of goofs in the movie. It shouldn't be called a zombie movie, you can't call them that because the infected are alive, a zombie is dead-turned-alive. And how the streets are empty, wouldn't it be more believable if there was at least one dead body outside? But what puzzles me most is how the whole city lost electricity, water and radio signals, for these to be available, machines are used so that people don't have to manually work these out. So how could electricity, water and radio signals disappear with the people? Or in the beginning of the movie, how could a group of activists penetrate a facility of that nature? And why is it left without any security? Or why when they stopped in the grocery, from the outside it could be seen to be in complete darkness, but when they get inside, the whole place is bright because all the lights are on, when there wasn't supposed to be any electricity. Or the scene where Selena was giving Hannah pills saying ""I'm making you not get it"" not get what? Definitely not the infection because apparently there's no cure. Hannah didn't take it because the soldier came in before she got the chance to put it in her mouth, but she behaves like a drugged person after, but then she sobers up when she sees her family picture.I think what caused the disappointment for me is the lack of explanation and reason. There was no explanation behind the origin and activity of the virus. There was no understanding of anything at the end of the movie. It's more like another excuse to see gore, or to blow up a building (a gasoline station in this movie) or to enter a grocery store and take everything you want without paying.But I do praise Cillian Murphy's acting abilities. And also that who played the soldier's leader (I forgot the name) and Selena - she played her part of a sexy, attractive, tough female with angst very nicely. Though I think that Megan Burns(Hannah) got a little more credit for her small part.",28 Days Later...

1135,straybirds,Amazing and Beautiful,9,20 January 2006,"I love this film, and have done since i first saw it. The moment the film begins you know your in for a treat. The digital shots that are so clean that they're dirty, the music which is so amazingly contrasting. This film is a masterpiece, a film that takes modern British film to a new level, finally giving it a little more credit. The film is gory, and at times horrifying; but, thank the lords, not one red-herring fiasco in sight. If you think there is going to be a blood-thirsty viral maniac around the corner, hang tight, there probably is. However, there are times near the third quarter of the piece that can drag a little, but for a first time viewer it's a good time to calm yourself down. The ending is......well it leaves you on a bit of an anti-climatic tail-off (hence the 9oo10). But overall...bravo!",28 Days Later...
1136,ttomasello-08036,"A Definitive ""Zombie"" film",8,24 November 2020,"Regardless as to whether the ""rage virus"" patients are technically zombies, this film is the reason for the zombie phenomenon of the mid 2000's through mid 2010's. However, besides the innovation of what we view as a ""zombie apocalypse"", 28 Days Later goes much further with its analysis of a post apocalyptic world, along with strong social and political allegory. Rather than solely watching a group of survivors slowly get picked off by hordes of infected (per the typical zombie feature), hear you see a film that spends more of its time with the main characters, and studies their changes to their new environment.Jim (Cillian Murphy) is the centerpiece and audience lens of this story as the audience follows him from the moment he wakes up from his coma. You follow Jim as he travels through London and tries to comprehend what it means to live in such a brutal place. Jim's role as a fairly weak protagonist makes him arguably more relatable than a typical badass leader type (Brad Pitt in World War Z), and easier for the audience to relate to him and his fear of abandonment in this cold, brutal world. The few supporting characters all deliver solid performances, most notably female lead Naomie Harris. The film's small cast works to its benefit as the audience can spend more time growing with the characters.As far as the plot is concerned, the story starts off fairly traditional for a zombie/infection/post apocalyptic film. However, the character driven narrative separates from others within the genre. That said the film does have good horror elements in multiple parts of the film, and the overall atmosphere for much of the movie is one of the most haunting cinematic worlds ever put to film. This is done by masterful cinematography, and great set pieces. Even if the film doesn't have as many gigantic moments where say a couple hundred zombies are attacking the characters, the films more small scale climactic moments are honestly more frightening, and director Boyle does an incredible job at making every scene evocative. The climax, and third act of this film can be considered strange and a change of pace from the rest of the film, however the incredible direction, and great performances (especially from Murphy) make the climax of this film arguably my favorite amongst the genre. As far as plot goes this film does a great job at understanding relationships and people in a world that feels truly haunting to anybody watching it.28 Days Later might not be as high octane as other ""zombie"" films (including my personal all time favorite Train to Busan), but the film's character dynamic, world building, and commentary on the nature of people is applaudable. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who appreciates a good Drama, as well as anybody who enjoys the post apocalyptic/zombie genre. Horror fans, however, should know that this film isn't always on the edge of your seat scares, and often is a bit slower. This movie to me is an 8/10, or Great. While the film might have a couple plot conveniences that hold it back, the film does an impeccable job and character crafting and world building that make me excited for a rewatch.",28 Days Later...

1138,timothy-phillips,It was a film of two halves-poor and even worse!,1,20 March 2006,"The premise for this film, although by no means innovative was inspiring. It was only sad that the delivery was so monumentally horrendous! There were more holes in it than a string vest and even with a late appearance by Eccleston, thoroughly unconvincing as an armed forces commander, could not possibly be salvaged. Instances like the fact that they claimed that they would have to wait until morning before it was safe to travel- then a few minutes later being outside a tower block in the dark!! They took their food from Budgens! Obviously Sainsburys and Tescos were not good enough for them ! And after four weeks all the fresh food was in absolutely pristine condition!!! The list of errors and weaknesses are endless but to its credit the opening scene was splendid and did give me hope that it might be sustained-but it was nothing but false expectation! Right from the outset when the main character regained consciousness after his road accident in a hospital there were encountered the initial germ of flaws-why was he stark naked on a NHS bed!!! Yet enough of all that, I could forgive the lack of accuracy in the first part of the film because of the excellent photography and succeeding in the naturally difficult task of capturing a deserted London-no mean feat! But the second half just lost the plot entirely! It was like I had started watching another film! It was incoherent and seemed as though the writer had just given up on it! Pity he hadn't done so much earlier! I gave it 1 only because I wasn't offered the choice of providing it with a big 0! If you are going to have the conception of an outstanding story, as this undoubtedly is, then at least see it through with clear insight. I appreciate it was made on a tight budget, and it shows, but the script could have been so much improved and not developed into something so contemptuously crass.",28 Days Later...
1139,dwphillips,great horror flick,10,24 March 2006,"First if all, this is a great horror flick, but in no way a zombie movie. Zombies are dead creature's that are rejected from hell, and can only be killed by destroying its brain. In 28 days later, the people get infected with rage, there is no dead people walking, they have never entered hell, and you can kill them just by shooting them in the stomach. With that said this is an amazing horror movie. The camera work and soundtrack add to the intensity and brilliants of the movie. The story line is attractive, and the way in which the plot moves keeps you guessing, while bringing up some good facts about men, and the rage that is in us. The movies talks about the rage people have always shown to others by ""men killing men,"" and even the rage we show when protecting the ones we love. This is a first rate movie, a must see for all horror fans.",28 Days Later...
