0,MartinHafer,"Don't tell my daughters, but I did not love this film...",6,3 June 2011,"For some time, my oldest daughter has tried to get me to watch this film. In addition, my younger daughter has repeatedly told me how wonderful this film is. Well, don't tell them, but I was not in love with this film. For a teen film, it's not bad but it just left me a bit flat. Perhaps this might be because I am a guy, as even my wife liked the film. Regardless, while I liked parts of the film, overall it's just not a particularly distinguished film for me.Lindsey Lohan plays a new girl to the local high school. She wants to fit in and somehow gets accepted by a small group of the foulest and most self-absorbed girls the school had to offer. And, at first, Lindsay pretends to be their friends so she can find a way to bring this clique down a peg, but over time she, too, becomes one of them--just another nasty and self-absorbed teen girl. Eventually it all comes to a HUGE blow-up--after which there is a COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS AND UNBELIEVABLE finale. None of the final 15 minutes seemed to make sense or was the least bit believable. But, supposedly the film is supposed to mean something deeper...though I have no idea what this message is.This is a film that has nice parts but the sum of them seems morally ambiguous and confusing. I was surprised that the many ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members in the film were excellent in this movie--and this is a surprise, as too often the SNL cast members did films that, frankly, were not all that good. Sorry, folks--perhaps it's just because I am an old fart of 46 years, but I wasn't incredibly impressed by the film. Try watching ""17 Again""--now that's a good teen film.",Mean Girls
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Smart, dark and fun teen comedy!",8,9 June 2009,"I thought this a really entertaining film. With a spirited cast, a very good script, a good soundtrack and a nice romance what more could you possibly want? Lindsey Lohan is lovely as Cady Heron, better than she was in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. She is given great support from an excellent supporting cast, from the likes of Tina Fey and Rachel McAdams. The script was dark and humorous, my favourite bit was when all the girls start fighting after they discover that they are being badmouthed in a book. And there is always time for a romance that doesn't always interfere with the story. In fact, my only real complaint is that it gets a little sentimental, but apart from that, an enjoyable and engaging film, with a 8/10. Bethany Cox",Mean Girls
2,bkoganbing,Distaff pressures,7,1 February 2014,"Although Mean Girls is billed as a comedy and God knows it has enough funny moments in it, it's really a quite serious film for young girls showing the pressures they have in high school. Don't think the male side doesn't have any, not by a long shot.But we are dealing with the distaff side and whole issues are raised by the presence of Lindsay Lohan fresh from the jungle. Not that Lohan was Sheena Queen Of The Jungle, but her parents are zoologists and she was raised and home schooled in Africa. She's quite the beauty, but not knowing the ropes she offends the leader of the cool kids clique Rachel McAdams.She befriends Lizzy Caplan as the lesbian and the school's gay male Daniel Franzese and they being the most outcast of all get together with Lohan to bring down McAdams and her sycophants. Lohan shows just like Norma Shearer in The Women she's wearing Jungle Red and she knows full well what that means.Tina Fey as a popular teacher and Tim Meadows as the principal have their hands full as the girls break out into anarchistic warfare. In the end Lohan becomes the catalyst for healing as well.A lot of funny stuff gives us enough sugar to make a spoonful of medicine go down easy. Sad to say a lot the message of Mean Girls maybe lost on a lot of peopleGood ensemble performance by the cast. Mean Girls ought to be required viewing at high schools.",Mean Girls
3,SnoopyStyle,"Great Tina Fey writing, and a still fresh faced Lindsay Lohan",8,27 December 2013,"Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is the new girl in school after having spent much of her life in Africa with her zoologist parents. She befriends Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and Damien (Daniel Franzese) who tells her about the various cliques in school. The top clique is the Plastics led by the queen bee Regina George (Rachel McAdams) and her followers Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried).Screenwriter Tina Fey is able to inject a lot of humor in what could have been too serious and formulaic movie. The sharp observations comes from Rosalind Wiseman's book. And the likability comes from a still fresh faced Lindsay Lohan. While Rachel McAdams shows her versatility as the top mean girl, and who knew there was such acting talent in Amanda Seyfried doing the standard dumb blonde. The only sour note for me is this obsession with getting hit by the school bus. It doesn't strike me as funny.",Mean Girls
4,Horst_In_Translation,"Entertaining and relevant, Lohan's brightest hour perhaps",8,29 January 2016,"""Mean Girls"" is an American high school film from over ten years ago and, by some, these 95 minutes are considered a modern classic today. I cannot blame them. I was very much entertained watching this one. There was hardly a minute that did not have some (at least) decent humor to it. The biggest strength of this film is that it never takes itself too seriously. Yes there are dramatic scenes, but they all come with an ounce of humor. The best example is perhaps people being hit by buses, a running gag throughout the entire film. Another example would be Lohan's final speech, during which the headmaster brings the comic relief. This is exactly how comedies should handle the subject of dramatic moments. Tina Fey did an outstanding job with the script here and it's a shame she did not get an Oscar nomination for her adaptation of Rosalind Wiseman's book.Fey also plays one of the major supporting characters herself and with that she also nails the part. But pretty much everybody in this film does. It really has so many memorable characters I must say, down to some that really appear almost never, like the Asian girls or the PE teacher or Amy Poehler's character etc. I could go on for a while. This film is truly a showcase of what many more comedies should look like, but unfortunately don't. It's also nice to see some familiar faces like the janitor from ""Scrubs"". ""Masters of Sex"" fans will also be delighted. It is pretty sad that all these actors and actresses apparently managed much bigger (or at least more prolific) careers than lead actress Lindsay Lohan. I believe she shows her talent in here and it's quite a shame how much south her career has gone since then with Emma Stone basically taking her place. Nonetheless I still have hope for Lindsay. Maybe she can make a tremendous comeback at some point. I believe she has the range for it and can maybe also become an Academy Award nominee like Rachel McAdams this year if she gets the right role.As for ""Mean Girls"", to me the film is still one of the finest comedies of the 21st century and it matches my humour exactly on so many occasions from start to finish. Another strength of the film is also that it depicts nobody as completely good or evil and does a great job on creating shades for everybody. Caplan's character is not a saint for what she does to Regina either for example. Regina and her clique aren't bad guys either. Yes there are some moments to Regina, during which we see her true self as the situation is just too much for her keeping her mask on. I can only repeat myself. Fey did such a great job with the writing of the story, the characters and the comedy here. This makes me truly curious about her other works as a writer, even if I have seen the entirety of ""30 Rock"" already. ""Mean Girls"" is a very delightful watch and, at the same time, a film with morals and a message. Highly recommended.",Mean Girls
5,claudio_carvalho,Silly and Funny Teen Comedy,7,17 April 2005,"The teenager Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) has just arrived in United State of America, after being raised in Afrika without going to conventional school. Their parents are zoologists, and her mother has been her tutor and she was educated at home-school, being an excellent student in mathematics. When she arrives in the high-school, she looks for a spot in one of the groups, becoming friend of the rejected Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan), unfairly called of lesbian by the other girls, and the gay Damian (Daniel Franzese). When The Plastics, the most closed clique in the school leaded by the evil Regina George (Rachel McAdams), invites her to join their selected group, Cady accepts the invitation, trying to reach their dark secrets to disclose to her friends, but later she changes her behavior with her friends. When she has a crush on the former boy-friend of Regina, Aaron Samuels, Regina looks for revenge, plotting an evil plan against Cady. ""Mean Girls"" is a silly and funny teen movie, supported mainly by the gorgeous and charismatic Lindsay Lohan. The story explores the behavior of the teenagers, trying to find their true personality while molding their characters. The cast is very funny, and the story is totally based on the American culture and behavior of the American teenagers. Anyway, it is a good entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Meninas Malvadas"" (""Mean Girls"")",Mean Girls
6,kosmasp,It's good to be bad,8,21 July 2009,"There are movies who act as if they're bad and then there is Mean Girls. A movie that proves, you can appeal to a teen audience and still break teen comedy conventions. A movie with a cast, that looks perfect even 5 years later. Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Tina Fey, the Girl from the Mamma Mia and Jennifer Body's movie and many more, bring an attitude to the film, that is both fresh, funny and appealing to anyone who just a little cynic in him.While it's obvious that the cast had fun making the movie, it's also fun to watch. Of course it's exaggerated, how the teen girls act in this movie, but that makes up for the comedy part of it. A great cynical look and a fun movie to watch (some compared it to Heathers, which I can't really add anything to, because unfortunately I haven't seen that one)",Mean Girls
7,gavin6942,Brilliant,7,14 January 2015,"Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is a hit with the Plastics, the A-list girl clique at her new school, until she makes the mistake of falling for Aaron Samuels, the ex-boyfriend of alpha Plastic Regina George (Rachel McAdams).On its face, this 2004 comedy was a showcase of up-and-coming young actresses: Lohan, McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried. And, to some degree, this is completely true. Besides Lohan (who self-destructed), these are now (2015) some of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Seyfriend is especially big. (Where did you go Chabert?) Heck, this was even a great boost from Tina Fey. But, it is much more than that. With a script from Fey, it is also a biting satire of high school politics, and is much funnier than other films of that genre. This is, in a sense, the better version of ""Heathers"". And this also gives Tim Meadows some of his best lines ever delivered in a film. Whatever happened to him? He is really the heart of this film.",Mean Girls
8,jboothmillard,Mean Girls,5,1 March 2007,"I think the only reason I wanted to see this film was because gay Richard from Big Brother 7 was talking about it all the time in the house, and called many of the girls ""Plastics"" (he was a good housemate). Anyway, basically Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is a new student from Africa, and quite quickly becomes friends with possible-lesbian Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and gay Damian (Daniel Franzese). But soon enough they want her to get to know the crudest, most beautiful and most popular girls in the school, The Plastics, unofficial leader Regina George (Rachel McAdams), follower Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) and dumb Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). As she gets to know them to tell Janis and Damian their dark secrets, she finds out they have a hate book with every person that has done something they hate them for. Also, Cady falls for Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) along the way. There is a lot of back-stabbing and argumentative moments, and I can see why Richard used Plastics as his descriptions, but this isn't really one of those great teen or chick flick films, but young girls will probably love it. I guess they are called Plastics because they are pretty much like Barbie dolls, beautiful (almost), naive and compete thickos. Worth watching, at least once!",Mean Girls
9,Tweekums,'Heathers' without the murder,8,8 March 2017,"Cady Heron was raised in rural Africa where she was home-schooled by her parents but now they have moved back to the United States sixteen year old Cady is about to go to high school and learn that high school girls can be as vicious as any wild animal. She quickly makes friends with Janis Ian and Damian Leigh, two outsiders, who caution her about the school's various cliques; most notably 'The Plastics'; a trio of girls led by queen bee Regina George. Cady is a little surprised when she is invited to sit with The Plastics at lunch for a week; Janis encourages her to do so, so they can learn their embarrassing secrets. Soon Cady is very much one of the group but she continues to work against them; constantly driving wedges between them. Of course as she works to undermine these titular 'mean girls' she becomes just as mean herself and in the process alienates just about everybody. While all this is going on she is also trying to get the attention of Aaron Samuels a boy in her maths class; going as far as deliberately getting bad grades so she can ask him for help. Of course she must ultimately face the consequences of her actions and try to undo the trouble she has caused.I probably wouldn't have watched this film if it hadn't come as part as a boxed set and when I started watching I didn't expect anything special but much to my surprise I really enjoyed it from start to finish. Lindsay Lohan is a delight as Cady; she does a fine job portraying the character as she goes from naïve new comer to realising that she has become the thing that she hated to paraphrase Nietzsche 'She who fights monsters might take care lest she becomes a monster'. She is ably supported a fine cast; most notably Rachel McAdams who does an impressive job as Regina; a girl who thinks being popular is her right. The drama provides a good number of laughs along the way and while there are inevitably some clichés they are justified by the story. Writer Tina Fey, who also plays Cady's maths teacher, provided some great dialogue that is witty and believable. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the genre.",Mean Girls
10,BA_Harrison,"A lean, mean teen movie.",8,31 May 2020,"Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, Lacey Chabert, and Rachel McAdams, strutting their stuff in a succession of teeny, tiny outfits (including sexy PVC Santa dresses)... nice! But Mean Girls is more than just fit young women in skimpy clothing. It's actually a very smart comedy, with lots of genuinely laugh-out loud gags, and it's got a heartfelt message to boot: don't be mean to people, it's just not cool!Lohan, in her prime (pre-criminal record), is radiant as Cady Heron, the new girl at North Shore High School, who struggles to adapt to school-life after 12 years of home-schooling in Africa. Befriending outcasts Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian Leigh (Daniel Franzese), Cady is educated on the school's various cliques, but warned away from one in particular, the 'Plastics', a group of pretty but shallow 'alpha' girls for whom popularity and appearance is everything.But when 'Queen Bee' Regina George, leader of the 'Plastics, welcomes hottie Cady to her clique, Janis sees an opportunity to set the narcissistic girls against each other, payback for all of their meanness. Seeing just how horrible the Plastics really are, Cady agrees to help Janis, but in doing so, she risks becoming what she despises.Written by (and starring) Saturday Night Live's Tina Fey, Mean Girls is an observant comedy, borrowing elements from the comedienne's own experiences at high school. Fey's characters are comical yet believable, the dialogue is sharp and very witty, and the ensemble cast give excellent performances, with Lohan putting in a 'career best' performance - the Teen Choice Awards do not lie! Following on from the success his fun Lindsay Lohan hit Freaky Friday, director Mark Waters keeps things nice and breezy, with a brisk pace and plenty of laughs, both verbal and visual. An upbeat pop/rap soundtrack perfectly complements the action.",Mean Girls
11,Quinoa1984,"has a satirical appeal that isn't razor sharp, but good enough; Lohan's best starring role to date",7,19 May 2006,"Looking past all the media hoopla, maybe not as deserved at all as some people might think, to the star Lindsay Lohan, she does have enough talent past the sweet-natured personality and beautiful looks. And for her skills she is put to very good use in the film Mean Girls, not as vicious and confused as its 80's comparison Heathers, but with a much more clever view comedy wise on high school life- particularly among teenage girls- than any given teen comedy of the past half decade. Screenwriter Tina Fey is most to credit here, as she is able to take adapt this tale into something that can be appealing to more, possibly, than the typical just-teen-crowd. Does it reach even further into other satire of life like Election? Not as much as one might think. It's a little too goofy for that, and it is this that also gives Lohan and the good supporting cast some room to make some laughs.It's a look at a class system in the high-schools of the movies, where the teen-girl upper class 'click' (called the Plastics) are what Lohan's character wants to take down alongside her new friends. But much as in a kind of corporate environment, she gets involved deep undercover becoming a 'plastic', and its inevitable wretched side involving a 'burn book'. Some of the steam that's built up in the first half of the film starts to fizzle out towards the end, even as there is a hysterically funny moment involving Rachel McAdam's character on a road outside of the high school. And, without a doubt, some of the jokes fall flat. But Lohan herself is a big part of the success of the movie, as her personality, with all the appeal of the better teen-girl stars of the post-modern age (a little more sultry than the John Hughes girl but with a certain fresh side as well). There's also a perfect scene involving the plastics at a talent show, in complete Santa-suit regalia. It's a fun little drip of a teen comedy that I've watched a couple of times on TV since it was released two years back, nothing special but certainly not forgettable either. 7.5/10",Mean Girls

Tina Fey did a great job, she is definitely a great comedian. Besides her we also have many other actors from SNL so it is not surprising that it is so good.The storyline is pretty clever. Of course since it is not documentary but comedy it does exaggerate what high school is like but one still can connect to the issues it presents. And it is full of quotes that are just classic now.The characters are all well done to represent different kind of students and parents. And the main characters have a deeper personality, one starts to understand them and their actions the more one gets to know them.Acting is very good as well. Everyone did a great job. I especially want to mention Rachel McAdams who was Regina, the meanest girl o them all. And she was perfect in this role.There isn't anything bad about this movie that I can think of.

She is just emulating what she portrayed in this film.We have the new student (Lohan)home-schooled and repatriated from the African continent. Tina Fey is the math teacher who talks about her personal life with the students-including her recent divorce and the fact that she works three jobs. Any hint here of low-teacher salaries?Then there is the group of girls, the usual campus queens, who befriend Cady (Lohan) only to be betrayed by her when she accepts the friendship of the head girl's ex-friend who is trying to get revenge on her, as well as the gay boyfriend who makes it clear that he always has pink.We view plenty of back-stabbing.

That is, until she joins The Plastics, the most powerful girl clique in school, fronted by queen bitch Regina George.""Saturday Night Live"" writer Tina Fey, for her first feature length script, adapts from Rosalind Wiseman's nonfiction best seller ""Queen Bees And Wannabes"". The result is an astute and wickedly funny picture that manages to rise above the clichés that fill out the modern day teen movie. Ultimately a black comedy about bullying and violence {Cady's links to school behaviour and the African wild is particularly telling}, Fey and her director Mark Waters push things about as far as they can, even daring to slot in unlawful teacher/student affairs. Seen as an amalgamation of Heathers and Clueless {interesting that Waters brother, Daniel, wrote Heathers}, Mean Girls holds up surprisingly well on further viewings. Many characters are richly drawn and given sprightly peccadilloes, and most, if not all, are excellently portrayed by the youthful cast. Backed by a rocking sound track and impressively vigorous sets, these Mean Girls may be excessively mean, but it's one hell of a devilishly delightful film. 8/10",Mean Girls
17,jotix100,Queen Bee and Wannabees,7,22 November 2005,"Rosalind Wiseman wrote the novel that Tina Fey adapted for the screen. The result, ""Mean Girls"" is a statement about what it's like to be a student going through high school today. In fact, it presents an ugly side about how school, a place for lasting friendships, camaraderie, and just a place for learning is everything but that, according to what one witnesses. In fact, in order to navigate its cliques and groups, one needs a route map in order not to offend anyone. ""Mean Girls"" is directed by Mark Waters, who gives it a light touch.At the center of the story we find Cady, a newly arrived girl who has lived in Africa and has been taught by her parents. Since they are back in the country, they enroll their daughter so she can have the experience of mixing with her peers. Cady, who is a sweet and naive girl unexposed to the real world, finds friendship with a pair of unpopular students, Janis Ian and Damian.Cady is guided through the ropes by her new friends who suggest to her to penetrate the world of the ""Plastic"" trio who are the local fashionistas in their school. These young women live to dress for school; instead of studying, the trio has their own set of rules, which totally confuses Cady, who adapts, but she has no feeling for her new acquired friends.Cady makes the mistake of liking one of the Plastics former boyfriend, the hunky Aaron. When she confesses it to Gretchen, this one tells her that is a no-no according to an unknown code of conduct because Aaron is Regina's former boyfriend, and she is to stay away from him. Cady excels in math, but she decides to play dumb in order to have Aaron like her.

There has been a small number of films in recent years (""Clueless"" and ""Saved!"" come immediately to mind), that are nicely filling in the gap left when Hughes' brat packers became too old to be playing high schoolers (though actually they were too old to be playing high schoolers even back then).

19,anaconda-40658,Mean is Good!,10,4 June 2015,"Mean Girls (2004): Dir: Mark Waters / Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried, Tina Fey: Fantastic teen comedy about ugliness that can stir within the midst of the beautiful. Lindsay Lohan stars as a teenager who moves from Africa with her family and enters a public high school where she becomes involved with the popular girls. When she shows an interest in the leader's ex-boyfriend she is betrayed but remains friends in order to sabotage their popularity. Wonderfully detailed with a lesson for anyone who has ever felt the harsh lashes of bullying. Directed with insight by Mark Waters who previously directed Lohan in the overrated Freaky Friday. He also had the misfortune of associating his name with the embarrassing Head Over Heels. What truly works is the detailed characters that rise above teen movie conventions. Lohan is hilarious as Cady whose high school experience is different but her dealings with verbal abuse is sneaky. Rachel McAdams is excellent as the cruel ring leader, with the insecure yet loyal gossip Lacey Chabert and the unintelligent rants of Amanda Seyfried who both steal scenes as fellow mean girls. Tina Fey brings comical sensibility as a teacher with good intentions yet she gets caught up in a subplot involving a Burn Book. Easily one of the best teen films since 2000 with a theme regarding gossip and other mean things. Score: 10 / 10",Mean Girls
20,Wuchakk,Overrated High School dramedy with Lindsay Lohan & Rachel McAdams,5,9 June 2016,"Released in 2004, ""Mean Girls"" stars Lindsay Lohan as a home-schooled teen who has spent most of her life in Africa with her zoologist parents. They move to the Chicago area and she has her first exposure to an American school where she's welcomed by three popular girls known as the Plastics (Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried & Lacey Chabert). Tina Fey wrote the screenplay based on Rosalind Wiseman book and also stars as a teacher. Tim Meadows plays the principal while Amy Poehler plays the mother of the snootiest girl, Regina (McAdams). This movie has garnered a good reputation over the years and I thought it would be in the same league as 1995's ""Clueless"" and 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" but that's not the case. The good news is that the main girls shine in their roles, particularly Lohan and McAdams, and the movie's consistently amusing (including a couple of laugh-out-loud sequences where youths are compared with the habits & temperament of African wildlife); moreover, there's a good message at the end about not being fake and there's thankfully almost zero raunch. But there's something palpably perverse about the proceedings that turned me off. The movie's competent and entertaining, but it lacks heart and isn't as rooted in reality as the aforementioned flicks; it's therefore not as moving or profound. The film runs 97 minutes and was shot mostly in Toronto, but with high school interiors shot in New Jersey. Some scenes were done in Santa Clarita, California.GRADE: C+",Mean Girls
21,The_Void,Intelligent and witty comedy with a few flaws,7,15 December 2004,"Usually, I find that teen comedy is an enjoyable, but brainless genre. Not that there's anything wrong in that, as it normally makes for fun viewing, but when one comes out that isn't empty in the brain department, it is an event of particular note; and Mean Girls is a film that fits that description. Hollywood's hottest teen starlet, Lindsay Lohan stars as Cady Heron, a sixteen year old home-schooled girl that has lived in Africa all of her life. Because of her life in Africa, Cady thinks she knows about survival, but she's about to learn it all again when she starts high-school for the first time and comes into contact with an A-list clique known as 'The Plastics', headed by the very 'mean' Regina George and her slightly less mean, but very loyal cronies; the very sexy Gretchen Wieners, and Karen Smith. The movie is very obviously written by a woman, and it seems to be geared towards teen girls more than any other audience; but there's still much for other people to enjoy about it.Mean Girls is keen to draw parallels between how teenagers interact within the society of a high school, and how animals act in the jungle. This is a fair comparison and one that will probably ring true for most people that have attended high school. However, that isn't where this movie's main asset lies; it's the hilarious way that the girls interact with each other that is. The first hour of the movie is hilarious, and it's great fun to sit and watch as the girls manipulate, connive, bitch and back-stab their way through one another. Unlike other teen comedies, such as American Pie; this one doesn't rely on big set-pieces to bring in the laughs, and most of them spring from its witty and intelligent script; and it's funnier for it. However, a great first hour gives way to a rather trite final third, but it doesn't completely spoil the movie. It doesn't quite work because the movie has been living up to its title throughout, so when it stops being mean and starts being sentimental; it doesn't really fit what it's being building up to all the way through. However, the final third does allow the film to bring out its message, which is warm and actually has some meaning behind it.As mentioned, Lindsay Lohan heads a great cast of young talent. This is my first encounter with this actress, and I'm fairly impressed by what she's done here. Although her performance isn't magnificent, teen starlets have come with an expectation of being rubbish recently, and Lindsay proves this trend wrong here. The rest of the cast is made up mostly of lesser-known teen stars, but all excel in their roles and there isn't a weak link amongst them. The soundtrack to the film isn't particularly good and comprises mostly of teen-friendly fluff songs (including Kelis' extremely rubbish 'Milkshake'), which fit with the film; but you do get the impression that they're just there to please the teen crowd when the film would have been better without them.Despite some flaws that I've mentioned, Mean Girls still stands out as a refreshing teen comedy. Although it doesn't surpass the film it took influence from; the magnificent 'Heathers' by a long way, it still has some nice moments and a brain to boot.",Mean Girls
22,Sylviastel,Still a funny look at teen life!,8,25 November 2007,"I liked this movie so much that I could see it again. Lindsay Lohan is perfectly cast as Cady Heron, a home-schooled girl, who spent most of her youth in Africa. She had no idea that a suburban high school in Chicago could be more dangerous. She befriends Janis Ian, a Gothic girl who was ostracized by Regina George, and Damian, a flamboyant homosexual teen. They are the outsiders and I know that I am probably one of them. Janis' hatred for Regina George is not uncommon. Regina is like the queen or celebrity of the school who bullies everybody from her parents to the principal. Tina Fey does a remarkable job in adapting the book to a screenplay very admirably. She also has a small part as a divorced teacher who works three jobs. Other cast members include Saturday Night Live alums like Tim Meadows as the school principal, Amy Poehler as Mrs. George in a hysterical performance, etc. There is even a cameo by Drew Barrymore in here. The story is as old as time especially with Cady becoming a plastic chick like Regina, Gretchen, and Karen who are like school royalty. Since I work in a high school, the plot is far-fetched but it could apply especially now with internet and cyber-bullying in high school. It's a great movie.",Mean Girls
23,mm-39,Educational,7,10 May 2004,"Being a guy and not seeing a highschool in 15 years this movie was a education.  My wife enjoyed it, and I found it educational.  This reminded me of a few family squables I gone through.  Believe me if guys behaved in this way their would be blood and a fight.  This film is full of sterotypes that made me laugh.  In my day, now I am sounding old, with Political correctness alot of these gags  could not be showing.  Nice to see that people can laugh at themselves again, instead of fighting.  Good message where burning people doesn't make you a better person, you still have the same faults.  Everyone eventually grows up, too bad not at my work place. Maybe, they should show this film at the post office, they could have a remake of this  with both men and women in there 30-40-50 and 60 who never out growen this stage in life, and maybe couple of university profs I know of too.

It's here where the writing really soars. Rachel McAdams is high contender for the most blindingly hateful shrew I've ever seen (not a slam, her acting's just that good). And her glowering face? Death rays, man! Really, with this movie, it's almost completely down to is casting. Which is pitch. Perfect. McAdams, Seyfried, Chabert, Fey, Lohan *are* these characters.

25,StevePulaski,The John Hughes Teen Comedy of 2004,9,3 July 2010,"""In a wasteland of dumb movies about teenagers, ""Mean Girls"" is a smart and funny one."" - Roger Ebert's review of Mean Girls.There's no other way to start a review of this film without saying something similar to that. We live in a wasteland of dumb, lame teenage movies. It seems like we haven't seen a knowledgeable teen film since the John Hughes era in film. This movie is somewhat exaggerated in points, but can be a real girls' high school experience. So after years of putting this film off, and not realizing what a big ""cult film"" it truly is, I did the thing most guys (or anyone nowadays) wouldn't do, watch a Lindsay Lohan movie.Cady Heron (Lohan) is a sixteen year old girl who lived in Southern Africa with her zoologist parents. She was homeschooled all her life and now is attending North Shore High School in Evanston, Illinois. She quickly becomes friends with a Gothic misfit named Janis and a odd boy named Damien. While becoming friends with them, she learn of Queen Bee, Regina George (Rachel McAdams) and her two minions Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried) who are both just as spoiled as she is. When Cady is a quick victim of the group nicknamed ""The Plastics"" because they look like Barbie dolls, Janis and Damien want to use her as bait to find out what it is like being a Plastic. But the results become drastic and now Cady doesn't know how to live her life normally.Director Mark Waters described this film as Clueless meets Heathers. Having not seen either film, though having knowledge of them it makes sense why its described that way. Lindsay Lohan is known for doing bad movies. The Freaky Friday remake was below average, Labor Pains was a decent, passable film, and Herbie: Fully Loaded was pure awful. Lindsay got a start in 1998 when she played double roles in The Parent Trap which was a decent film, but didn't live up to the original film. So ""Blohan"" outdid herself in terms of acting in this film.In terms of a teenage high school film, this was almost perfect. Its been a while since we saw a teen movie done well. With garbage like She's the Man, John Tucker Must Die, and other failed experiments gone wrong this was a breath of fresh air to see one done well. It really felt like a John Hughes film that was originally set to be released earlier in the eighties, but somehow got delayed until 2004. It had a Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Cub, Brat Pack film that is hard to elaborate without sounding like an idiot, still the enjoyment level in this film was over the top and this was the most fun I've had watching a Chick flick, Lindsay Lohan movie. Lets not forget the supporting actresses Amanda Seyfried, Tina Fey, and Amy Poehler (who would later work in the 2008 Comedy Baby Mama) deliver Grade A acting just as good as Lindsay Lohan.Starring: Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried, Amy Poehler, and Tina Fey.

I am becoming more impressed with Lindsay Lohan as an actress. I think she is extremely talented. The movie also just reminded me so much of my old high school. Everyone was so separated in their own groups, and everyone always wonders how does the popular girl get popular if everyone hates her?

28,blanbrn,"A film that takes us all back to our high school years, as we remember what we went thru with cliques, groups, and acceptance. One of the best films of the last 10 years!",9,21 December 2009,"I have finally watched ""Mean Girls"" and I must say that it's clearly one of the better films made over the last ten years. As you watch it really it revisits you the viewer on a time trip back to your high school days. As clearly all of us experienced these things of dealing with snobbish cliques, and dealing with the peer pressure of acceptance and wanting to be popular. As ""Mean Girls"" also shows all of the different types found in high schools from brains, jocks, nerds, basket cases, and elegant and sexy prom queen types.Lindsay Lohan in one of her best roles is Cady an American student who's spent most of her school days in Africa as her educated and cultured parents have spent most of the time in that region doing studies and research work. Finally they decide to enroll Cady in public high school in Illinois it's a culture shock as Cady is welcomed to this new world. From the get go it's tough for her to make friends and fit in. Yet one thing she's got going for her is she's a brain especially in math as she excels in Ms. Norbury's(Tina Fey) class.Still Cady wants to become popular and be in one of the respected cliques or as you will see later not so respected! She has her eye on a boy named Aaron Samuels(Jonathan Bennett)yet she's warned by two friends she's made who are both different a female lesbian and a gay guy that getting Aaron will be tough. Aaron use to date and go with the prom and beauty queen princess Regina George(Rachel McAdams in a very sexy role). However a plan has formed Cady will join Regina's clique along with friend Gretchen(Lacey Chabert)and along the way Cady will in a clever way transform and break down this mean group of girls and destroy them at their own cruel game! Cady is introduced to a life she's not use to like dressing all prim and proper in such a sexy and well liked fashioned way. The mean girls group have rules to make fun of others and to break them down. The ring leader Regina(Rachel McAdams) who's a sexy colored bra wearing princess who can get any guy she wants hams it up in a wicked way crushing and breaking the hearts of others at the same time looking adorable as we all remember a girl like that from our high school. However along the way fate and karma have a plan this group will be broken as people see a group for what they really are! In the end Cady learns in life to be accepted it's more important to be yourself as people respect you more as that's the message this film proves. Still it was sure fun along the way as it was fun to see the revenge inflicted on the mean girls as turnabout is fair as the student body saw it was more important to accept people for being original and not plastics ha ha!! As they would reward Cady for that. This movie is one of the best of the past 10 years one to watch many times as it's something we all can relate to as everyone went thru this in high school life, and the film is made so memorable and watchable by McAdams's sexy performance and the witty and sharp funny lines especially witty and quirky ones from Tina Fey.

30,KineticSeoul,Pretty good teen comedy that offers food for thought as well,7,6 October 2010,"Just about anyone that went through can relate with some of the stuff that goes on in this film, and I guess that is what makes it so intriguing and entertaining. Although some stuff is over exaggerate, it shows how when it comes to high school popularity just means everything to some people. The plot is about a Cady Heron(Lindsay Lohan)who is a home-schooled girl from Africa that moves to Evanston, Illinois and soon makes some unpopular friends that gets an idea to infiltrate a group of girls called the Plastics that are a group of skanky but somewhat popular girls. I would have never guessed that some of the actresses that played the Plastics would become successful with their acting career while Lindsay Lohan's starts to go downhill. The exaggerate social interactions amongst the characters especially the Mean Girls was fun to watch and laugh at, with it's negative approach to showing female friend relations in adolescence. The movie also tries to make it seem like popularity is like some sort of drug where someone would do anything to be accepted, especially when Cady starts to become a Plastic herself. Which to some degree is true, there is life outside of high school, but I seen students do anything even getting into major trouble or doing things they really don't want to do for popularity. Overall it's a pretty good teen comedy that offers food for thought as well.7.8/10",Mean Girls
31,Buddy-51,could be more slashing but a decent little satire,7,12 September 2005,"Cady Heron is about to experience her first day at school. However, unlike most of us who went through this experience at around five years of age, Ms. Heron is an 11th grader who has spent her whole life living in Africa being home-schooled by her parents. Now that the family has moved to an Illinois suburb, Cady is about to be tossed into the shark-infested waters of what we commonly refer to as public high school. Having been thus far removed from catty American culture, Cady is, naturally, a naïve, good-natured teen who thinks only the best of people - until, that is, she comes up against a group of snooty, gossipy bitches known affectionately around campus as The Plastics. Much to her surprise, Cady is recruited into this most-coveted and most-hated of all the school's numerous cliques, and this is where the ""fun"" begins.""Mean Girls"" is a reasonably entertaining little satire, even though it rarely has the courage to go for the jugular when skewering its targets. Instead, it plays it safe and becomes, in the end, just as phony and plastic as the thing it is attacking. The film aims its sights at the usual high school horrors of cliquishness, backbiting and pre-programmed humiliation familiar to us from earlier teen comedies such as ""Clueless,"" if not from real life itself. The humor in the film ranges from the mildly acerbic to the heavy-handed and obvious, but Lohan's charming and winning personality goes a long way towards redeeming the movie. Moreover, the narrative arc works well, with Cady going from naïve innocent to calculating saboteur to certified snob to enlightened humanitarian without missing a beat.""Mean Girls"" would be better if it were, in fact, a whole lot meaner than it is, but for Lohan's performance and a few genuinely funny moments, it's worth watching.",Mean Girls
32,thesar-2,Crueler Intentions,8,27 February 2016,"A lot of people call this movie a total comedy, LOL a lot and quote it tremendously. I can see that. What I also saw, only for the second time in probably a decade, was an incredibly well-written film about revenge- on-revengeflipped over.I get a lot of humor here and I get all the quotable one-liners, but I saw how much heart was here. Where it took me from extreme predictability to ""Oh! I'm glad it changed course.""It wasn't easy to watch, up front, I'll admit. These girls, the title characters, were so bad, so shallow and people I would never want to know in real life, even in passing. But, Writer Tina Fey really shined on taking the clichéd and stereotypical ""Clueless/Heathers"" High School story to another level.New girl, Cady, is trying to fit in and when that blows, she simultaneously gives into the scum skanks, attempts to take them down and inadvertently becomes one of them. Will she learn right from wrong?Say what you want about Lindsay Lohan. Actually, say it before you see I Know Who Killed Me, Liz & Dick and The Canyons. But, she did great here. Completely believable and backable. The supporting cast, including the awesome Daniel Franzese whom I believe I had a nice conversation on Facebook with, also did great.Yes, it's another High School/Fit-In movie. But, it's so wonderfully written and played out, it's worth the watch. Still holds up almost 12 years later.***Final thoughts: I remember seeing this many years ago and liking it, but not enough to see or recommend it againuntil I was called ""Fetch"" one day by a dear friend of mine. I thought that was so cool she said that. Finally, someone told me where that was from and I've had this movie in my mind to see again ever since.""Gretchen, stop trying to make fetch happen! It's not going to happen!"" is the quote and I thank her for getting me to see this again. I can't wait to see it once again. Just not so long an absence this time.",Mean Girls

That's the thing about being old; teen comedies aren't necessarily on your radar. A little research indicates it's a bit of a classic; who knew?This is sort of Heathers-lite, with a previously home-schooled girl learns about high school cliques. It's quite funny, and while the dark comedy of Heathers is more memorable, Mean Girls is probably truer to the actual high school experience in which popular girls are petty and awful but no one gets murdered and no explosions occur. (Although neither film has an ending that approaches real life.)Lindsay Lohan is quite good, making her personality changes convincing and seamless, and the overall cast is first-rate throughout. Tina Fey's script is very funny and she's quite good as a teacher.",Mean Girls
34,ElMaruecan82,The Sisterhood of the Slo-Mo Walking Skirts...,9,1 January 2021,"""Our town worships success, the b**** goddess whose smile hides a taste for blood.""This is Hedda Hopper, the famous columnist speaking of Hollywood. And if you adapt it to the smaller context of a Californian high school and replace 'success' with 'popularity', you get the spirit of Mark Waters' cult-classic ""Mean Girls"" (a titular euphemism to the actual word used by Hedda).I avoided that movie for years, dismissing it as a chick flick and the overdose of pink in the poster didn't encourage me much, but let that be an advise for you big burly guys who'd rather go through a marathon of ""Fast and Furious"": just watch it. This is an instant classic, a comedy that starts with premises used to the bones in sitcoms and high school movies -not to mention the worst of the teen-comedy subgenre that prevailed in the late 90s and early 2000s- and still take you in a journey of pure hilarity and a clever social commentary about adolescence, friendship and cliques. Writer Tina Fey (who plays a teacher in the film) walks over a minefield of clichés with the grace of a ballerina.The film is about a 16-year old girl who grew up in Africa so her first day at school carries a more solemn resonance: it's her first day in any American high school, the muffin of her knowledge had yet to be buttered (to use one of the local idioms). And the newcomer need to find her place in that new jungle whose hierarchical systems are more complex than those of the animal reign (though not too different). She's helped by two marginal students: Janis (Lizzy Caplan) a gothic girl who's like a jollier version of Daria and Damian, an openly 'merry' student played by Daniel Franzese.With her two real friends, she learns the basics of the high school social pyramid and its extreme divisiveness. Indeed, we knew about jocks, nerds, queen bees etc. But the divisions that prevail in this school are vertical, horizontal, transversal, going as far as a distinction between Asian nerds and cool Asian beauties... in that maze of social branding when Facebook and social networks didn't interfere yet, Cady is (pun intended) a living 'clique bait'. And much to her luck (or misfortune), she catches the curiosity of the high school queen: the fittingly named Regina, played by Rachel McAdams. We all had a Regina in our high school. But let's start with her private little squad: the Plastics.Aah, the Plastics, the sisterhood of the slow-mo walking skirts, girls so proudly shallow and superficial that it almost inspires admiration. First, imagine if one of the ""Dumb and Dumber"" duo had a son with Lina Lamont with the payroll of a Beverly Hills housewife and then you get Karen. She's so stupid that she's actually the most likable of the group, for lack of a mind she's the least potentially malevolent and if her role is a goldmine for face palm-inducing quotes such as ""if you come from Africa, why are you white?"" I just loved much sweetness Amanda Seyfried put in the role and her agape and wide-eyed reaction when Regina hung up on her phone (because a fake cough didn't fool her) was worth a million.By the way, don't judge her for the 'Africa' quote. If you think Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) is more brilliant, you have another thing coming. Granted she gots an extra level of brain cells, she wastes them all in a desire to please and praise a queen, the one thing that can get in the way is her incapability to hide a secret and to deliver one item of the data of gossips, and don't get me started with her obsession with making 'fetch' a trend. Gretchen's personality is so diluted that you can't judge her negatively, after all the daughter of the strudel toaster inventor can't be that bad. Anyway, it all comes to Regina being the most self-assumed 'mean girl', the kind of 'mean' that justifies the end but she's not a villain for all that, just a 'pink panther' who's her own referential. In other words, guys want her and girls want to be her.Naturally, there's a tacit rivalry between Cady and Regina, one triggered as soon as she falls in love with Aaron (Jonathan Bennett), but the film deals with it in a way that cares less for plot mechanisms than unexpected situations speaking subtle truths about the contradictions and torments of teenagers. Adapted from Rosalind Wiseman's ""Queen Bees and Wannabes"", the film also conforts the general consensus that there's so much gossip, backstabbing, venom and jealousy in the world of girls that friendship seems impossible. Not that guys are better but they're clearly less sophisticated and will be more likely to let fists talk first. But Fey isn't writing a feminist film, it's a rather accurate and acute depiction of girls being their worst enemies, contradicting the myth of the best friend forever. By the way, Fey's own BFF Amy Poelher has a funny supporting role as Regina's immature mother who thrives for youth approbation and youth, period.The film still avoids clichés: the handsome boyfriend isn't just the brainless beauty and has an interesting reaction when Cady revealed she deliberately failed in math exams so he could help her, there's a bait-and-switch moment where you think Cady got the best of Regina and then she pulls off a clever trick with her 'Burn book' and so many great surprising moments that take you off guard (and I'm not talking of that school bus only). Speaking of the Burn Book, this is a reminder that the cause of all troubles didn't go through cyberbullying and this is why ""Mean Girls"" is also a millennial time capsule, less raunchy than its masculine equivalents (""Superbad"" and ""American Pie"") but no less naughty.Defying all conventions and proving that women can be funny (and good at math), ""Mean Girls"" is less mean-spirited than you'd expect, much smarter. And fun as hell.",Mean Girls
35,paul2001sw-1,Plastic targets,6,3 June 2007,"'Mean Girls' is a fun, zippy satire of American high school life. But one has to ask, what sort of high school is actually being satirised here? The answer is not so much the high school of real life, but rather the same sort of high school satirised in every other teen movie - one with no real social problems, some characters of immense wealth and beauty, and extreme factionalism amongst the pupils; and while the film has a certain edge, its underlying message is as optimistic and mushily warm as in (almost) every other film of this type.

Lindsay Lohan is the new girl who finds herself dragged somewhat unwillingly into the clique of mean girls of the title and is the centre of a plot to get revenge on the school's Queen Bitch, (Rachel McAdams). The 'be-true-to-yourself' moral means it goes a bit soppy towards the end but it has some great gags and Tina Fey's script, based on the book 'Queen Bees and Wannabes', is first rate. Fey, herself, turns up as a dedicated maths teacher but it isn't much of a role.

37,MLDinTN,fun high school film,7,7 November 2005,"This movie was pretty good. It makes fun of those popular girls in high school everyone loves to hate. The popular click is called the Plastics. Lindsay Lohen is Cady, a new student who has always been home schooled. She makes friends with Janis an outsider and her feminine buddy, Damian. Those two hate the Plastics. The Plastics led by Regina, invite Cady to lunch and soon they want her to become one of them. So, she tells Janis and Damian. They want her to do it because then they can sabotage the Plastics from the inside and ruin Regina's life. What Cady doesn't bargain for is she learns to like the popularity and wearing the cool clothes and parties. Regina keeps a book in which the click writes nasty rumors about other people. She gets mad at Cady over a guy and releases the book. She throws copies of its pages over the school halls. Once people read them, fights break out and craziness ensues and it's very funny. The principal calls for a meeting with all the girls and wants them to apologize for the awful things they do and say about each other.Of course, everything works out for Cady in the end. She gets her old friends back, breaks up the clicks, and people stop calling each other B*tch behind their backs.FINAL VERDICT: It's a fairly funny satire of life as a high school girl. Girls are petty and love to gossip behind one's back. The film deals with all that. I definitely think anyone in their teens can relate to this and will like it.",Mean Girls
38,Cineanalyst,Acting and Writing Teens,7,22 July 2020,"As a comedy, I think ""Mean Girls"" is one of the more amusing teen flicks to follow in the footsteps of John Hughes, albeit in a style that hardly rises above an extended skip from ""Saturday Night Live,"" the background from which several of the people involved in this movie came. The fish-out-water observations of the protagonist of girls going wild is pedestrian; by and large, these kind of movies have nothing to do with real high school or teenagers--indeed, the actors are really usually in their twenties, if not thirties, instead of their teenage years. Rather, they're about other movies, their conventions or tropes. Two interesting twists to this one, then, are that the lead is an actor-playing-an-actor, to infiltrate and sabotage the so-called ""plastics"" clique and dethrone its teenage tyrant, and that this group creates a ""Burn Book"" full of malicious comments on others in the school, including a teacher portrayed by the SNL alumnus who wrote the movie's screenplay.Generally, the cast is fine and included a decent mix of young talent and established SNL comics. The protagonist mean girl is such a method actor of a character that she becomes and remains in that character. Although teen idol Lindsay Lohan isn't a great-enough actress to do much with such promising material, she's fine enough, I suppose. The voiceover narration helps. Writer Tina Fey, too, as a performer is mostly just good at timing, but otherwise incapable of inhabiting more than a one-dimensional character. The breakout star of this cast was Rachel McAdams, as queen bee of the plastics. She actually appears to fully inhabit the character and not merely affect a knowing expression while muttering a humorous comment like Fey or just a fashionable look while relying on the narration to establish the character like Lohan. The heavy is important, too; think of all the many movies lacking a compelling baddie, of an actor in place to relish the villainry . It's hard to hate, just as it is to love, a cardboard-cutout of a character. While McAdams has gone on to do more than most of the cast here, too, as far as acting, it's unfortunate that she's also largely been wasted in much of her subsequent work, because she's very good here.

It's so much better than I could have imagined, especially with Lindsay Lohan in the lead. It's really, really funny and the film has some of the most memorable one-liners. The movie avoids many of the teen film clichés and even go as far as to make fun of them. And I was reminded of my high school days, but then again what high school don't have cliques? Mark Water's film is about a new girl named Cady Heron who has been home-schooled all her life until now. She's pretty but also incredibly smart. Almost right away, she gets involved with the Plastics: the meanest, prettiest girls in the school. After joining the Plastics, now Cady's reputation is put up to the test.The acting is actually really good. I'm not a Lindsay Lohan fan at all, but I will admit she was excellent in this movie. It's too bad that she has taken up her life with drugs and alcohol. Rachel McAdams is just stunningly mean and gorgeous and this is her role to stardom (plus the Notebook.) Comedy goddesses Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were excellent working together. I also like the performances by Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert.Overall, Mean Girls is your above-average teen flick and takes all the usual clichés, and throws them out the window. This film is not only incredibly funny about life in high school, but also meaningful. I can relate to some of the experiences Cady had. This film has a strong script and a really good soundtrack with some songs that were big in my day (not too long ago). This is much better than I expected and I give credit to me female friends for putting this on my radar. I rate this film 9/10.",Mean Girls

It's a movie that will have you chuckling from beginning to end as it boasts countless quotable moments that you can not help but smile at. It is a very smart comedy that does not intend on offending anyone, but merely to make you laugh. I did think that Cady could have been a far more likable and relatable character. I do not blame Lohan for this, but felt Tina Fey did not make enough effort in making her a realistic teenage girl. Particular decisions, like having her coming back from Africa, made her difficult to identify with. The comedic cast is all around terrific. Lindsay Lohan is an impressive lead, Rachel McAdams has great confidence in her role, Tina Fey has some hilarious moments, Tim Meadows steals every scene he is in and Amy Poehler had me crying with laughter.

So it was quite a payoff when it turned out to be quite fun film and nothing like the dreadful teen comedies we've suffered too much off in the past five years (making love to pies, losing ones' car and certain Scary Movies).The story has Cady Heron go through her first day of school...at sixteen. She's been homeschooled all her life and lived with her parents in the African bush. She has known nothing of the deceitful, backstabbing and ugly world of high school. Upon arrival she makes friends with a level-headed goth and a fat guy gay. They instruct her on who is naughty, nice and full of vice. The 'in' group of the school are 'The Plastics' (because they're so fake), a trio of cheerleaders who make everyone's life hell.The leader is Regina George, the nastiest girl in the universe and at her side and the dumb and airheaded Gretchen Wieners and Karen Smith (played by the impossibly cute Amanda Seyfried). In order to take them down Cady must become one of them. She takes great pride in ruining Regina only to take her place. Much like Arnie did in Predator, she became a monster in order to destroy a monster. With loads of observational humor and satire, Mean Girls ends up being a very intelligent movie, sort of a 'Clueless' that's not so nineties. A lot of attention is paid to character and performance, not something hastily thrown together and chucked out there. Originally it ended up with an R rating and had to be toned down. I would have loved to see that cut of the film.Another interesting thing is that I've always though Lindsay Lohan looked like the character of Ginny in Friday the 13th Part 2. So it was weird when the movie was featured in Mean Girls and had Cady startle her pals watching it by bursting through the door as soon as Jason bursts through the window.I will probably buy this on DVD when it comes out and I suggest you see it on the big screen. My showing was pretty packed and everyone seemed to enjoy it a lot.",Mean Girls
42,851222,Tina Fey's writing and Rachel McAdams steal the show,9,5 April 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Mean Girls"" (2004) is surprisingly funny movie, which is superbly written and acted along. Rachel McAdams, who later became biggest star from the great cast shines as Regina George, the true ""Mean Girl"". It is funny to see this movie first time in 2016 knowing now that Amanda Seyfried won't be typecast as a dumb blond in the future and have a wonderful carries while the star of this movie Lindsay Lohan will go down as a true ""Mean Girl"" in real life. Tina Fey did a great job in writing this movie and co-staring in it - screenplay is superb and funny - it proves that not every good comedy should be R rated.Overall, ""Mean Girls"" is a good movie. Superbly written and acted it doesn't tell fresh or original story - but it is a very fine movie.",Mean Girls
43,atlasmb,Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams Square Off,7,11 September 2017,"""Mean Girls"" feels perfectly suited to Lindsay Lohan's talents. As the new girl in school (Cady Heron) who is trying to fit in, she is extremely likable. She becomes fast friends with Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan, who nails her performance. If you are not familiar with singer Janis Ian, check out her hit single ""Seventeen"") and Damian (Daniel Franzese), but gets sucked into a three-girls clique called the Plastics. With her allegiance split between the two factions, she finds herself becoming a person she does not like.This film is notable for the break-through performances of Rachel McAdams and Amanda Seyfried. McAdams plays Regina, the queen of the Plastics. It is a role that is similar to many that preceded, but still holds up.Speaking of precursors, one might consider this film to be a rip-off of others that came before. Or it might be considered as merely referential. Or perhaps an homage. But however you chose to view it, it has definite references to ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""Clueless"", ""Risky Business"", and other John Hugh's films.The screenplay (adaptation) by Tina Fey is, at turns, clever and unsubtle. But it is a solid entry in the canon of teen comedies.",Mean Girls
44,tabuno,"Uneven, But Excellent Movie",7,25 January 2019,"2 May 2004. Trying a improve on a tried and true genre of Plastic Girls (clique girls against the innocent, naive girl) is always a difficult task and so with Mean Girls as it seems to struggle abit in finding its own form and style in the first half of the movie, attempting to steer away from the typical cliches which are nevertheless there. This movie goes further with high school bullying and places more emphasis on substance than comedy. By the end, the movie enters new territory for this movie genre resulting a measured dose of growing up. This dramatic comedy about growing up as a teen girl in school is a commendable and refreshing, though a bit uneven portrayal of girl bullying with both its funny moments and its dangerous moments creating a satisfying cinematic experience by movie's end.

46,sol-,My brief review of the film,7,23 November 2005,"Quite a few eyebrows were raised in early 2005 when 'Mean Girls' was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay by the Writer's Guild of America. The film did not go on to receive an Academy Award nomination in the field, but it had already completed quite an achievement - edging out scripts of acclaimed films such 'Finding Neverland' in the WGA competition. It is however no blunder that the film was nominated for its screenplay. There are many creative moments throughout and surprisingly a number of witty lines. The basic premise works quite well, or at least until the final third, where it starts to head into tiring, predictable territory with its messages pushed too hard. The narration also has a tendency to be overbearing, and the film of course has some of the silliness of the typical high school movies out there. This one is better though. If not distinctly so, 'Mean Girls' rises above quite a few of the clichés. The competition element works very well and the interactions of the teen characters seem quite natural. The film has good music too - both in background and the songs used. It is not an amazing film, nor a terribly deep one, but it is an amusing way to spend one's time, even if it does tire towards the end.",Mean Girls
47,briancham1994,Funny and clever drama,9,4 June 2020,"This film has a reputation for a reason! It is a high school comedy drama that is not totally cliche.

48,Floated2,It was pretty good,7,26 June 2010,"Okay so I watched this film because I heard reviews about it and all and I was surprised that's its actually a pretty good movie. Mean Girls is fun, fascinating, and entertaining. It's interesting to see how much power women wield over other girls and the men in their lives. In the social arena, women seem to be pushing all the buttons, directly or indirectly. This movie illustrates this very well although the movie did seem unrealistic and sorta a little fake. It was also surprisingly funny and the girls are beautiful. The plastic girls were annoying but they played they characters right, and Lohan was pretty good, she seemed confused at first but acted pretty good. Though I thought the ending could have been better, overall it was a good movie, worth checking out if you haven't already!",Mean Girls
49,insomniac_rod,Decent teen comedy. Take it for what it is...,6,8 December 2007,"Eh what can I say? It aired one day on Sky when I had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO; no college, no work, nothing. So I gave this movie a try after some good comments from people I know. I'm not a Lindsay Lohan fan but I got to admit that she's freakin' hot. Oh my, and this movie just displays Mrs. Lohan's in all of her glory. She is the typical c*** teaser. She just walks around wearing the shortest and kinkiest mini skirts and sexy clothing displaying her amazing, huge breasts. (Drools). Sorry. To the movie. Well this is the typical teen comedy that has plenty of clichéd but funny characters, and situations that really happen in high school but only funnier. Not to mention that there isa decent amount of black comedy that fits perfect in the story. The acting is pretty good for a movie that does not delivers many expectations. Let's be honest, this is not a movie that can generates many decent expectations. But for what it is, it's one of the best of it's kind. There are many sex jokes, naive jokes, and the typical American Piesque jokes. Surely this is one entertaining watch for those who expect light entertainment.This movie is like fast good: you enjoy it while consuming it and then your dump it quickly and forget about it immediately.Did I mention that Linsday Lohan and Rachel McAdams are unbelievably hot?Enjoy!!",Mean Girls
50,taylorkingston,One of my all-time favorite movies...,10,26 July 2015,"I absolutely love this movie. It is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is funny, real, and so in touch will the real world. It isn't over the top, it isn't too out there, and it's very relatable.This movie is about Cady Heron. She is a sixteen-year-old girl, who has just moved from Africa with her parents. Since she's been home-schooled, she finally goes to a real school, but is nervous for the transition. Whilst there, she realizes that high school is very different from the wild animal kingdom she grew up in. She makes a few friends with a couple of goofy outcasts, but soon gets invited to sit with The Plastics. The three most popular girls in the entire school. After this, her real friends convince her to go undercover with The Plastics to try and destroy Regina George's life. Cady doesn't want to at first, but after Regina makes out with Cady's crush, she decides that's what she needs to do. But after a while, she becomes more ""plastic"" than she expected.Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.",Mean Girls
51,lisafordeay,A very good teen movie,6,12 January 2019,"Mean Girls came out in 2004 and stars Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert and Rachel McAdams and tells the tale of a young girl named Cady played by Lohan who was homeschooled as a kid and moves to a new school where she befriends the plastics run by Regina George played fantastically by Rachel McAdams who is the IT girl who owns the Burn book where she writes mean stuff about her classmates. As well as having a super hot boy named Aaron Samuels played by Johnatgan Bennett who Cady later fancies. Although Cady is enjoying being a plastic will she lose control of her actual real friends and Aaron?Overall this was a real feel good teen movie. Rachel McAdams was brilliant as the backstabbing teen with a bad attitude. Amanda Seyfried also stars in this in her movie debut . I recently bought this again having owned it before and hated it so I decided to give it another chance and I like it now thanks to Ariana Grande' s throwback song Thank U Next.
If you are a fan of Lindsay Lohan like me or Rachel McAdams then you will like this movie.Keep an eye out for Tina Fey who plays a maths teacher in the film as well as writing the screenplay for this film.
Amy Poehler plays Regina George's mother who is hilarious in this film.

52,FiendishDramaturgy,Nice Commentary on the Mental and Emotional State of Teenage Girls,8,18 March 2007,"I really enjoyed this film, as it attempts through humor and irony, to show the emotional states and priorities of teenage girls. Some view this work as mere entertainment, but I think it went a bit deeper than that.This film demonstrates just how low some will go in order to insinuate themselves into the ""in"" crowd. It also demonstrates that there are few limits where some youths are concerned, when the goal is to just fit in...to survive the social demands of high school and college.This movie is rather sad, demented, and telling. It's billed as a comedy, but most people I know consider it more a drama with comedic moments. Lindsay Lohan shines as the new girl on the block.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Mean Girls
53,dee.reid,I've never seen so much pink...,10,21 September 2004,"...But of course that doesn't stop me from rating ""Mean Girls"" a perfect ""10"" now does it? I haven't seen a teen comedy like ""Mean Girls"" in a long, long time, and this is perhaps what everybody else thought too when it was released into theaters earlier this year. Maybe this film is what we've been waiting for: a teen comedy to come along and just catch us by surprise at the box office and drain our wallets of that hard-earned cash a little bit.With ""Mean Girls,"" we have a comedy about teenage girls that doesn't resort to sex and rampant nudity to hold the viewer's interest. We do get some pretty raunchy dialogue and antics (that nearly got the movie an ""R"" rating), but ""Mean Girls"" doesn't sell its soul at the last crucial moment to win over a potentially bored audience.After being home-schooled much of her entire life, Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is shipped off to mainstream American high school where she meets all sorts of new wild life. (Comparisons to the African jungle are in abundance within this film.) Wild life comes in the form of the various high school cliques. Being that she hasn't been in contact with other kids her age, Cady is unaware of the social hierarchy that exists in American high schools.She makes two friends right off the bat: the ambiguously-lesbian and semi-Goth chick Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and the ""too gay to function"" Damian (Daniel Franzese). Janis introduces her to the social hierarchy within their school and points out the most despised and popular clique: the Plastics, who are Regina (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen (Lacey Chabert), and Karen (Amanda Seyfried). It shouldn't be too obvious that these girls are all flash and glitter and no brains; and plus they get their name because they look like Barbie dolls.Janis has a plan for Cady to infiltrate the ranks of the Plastics and report back any nastiness so they can set up the ultimate sabotage. But the thing is, Cady begins to like her new lifestyle within the Plastics and gets into trouble when she falls for the ex-boyfriend of one of the Plastic girls.I just graduated from high school in June (""Class of 2004 hardcore!"" was our class motto) but seriously I don't ever recall a clique quite like the Plastics; that of course doesn't mean they didn't exist. My lack of definite observation could also be because I'm a guy and I typically try to stay as far away from girls like the ones that are depicted in ""Mean Girls"" as possible.The movie does offer us an accurate account of high school life, and more specifically teenage girl life. I'd be getting into dark territory by going any further than that.As a film, ""Mean Girls"" is truly one of the best comedies of the year, if not one of the overall best films. Lindsay Lohan was perfectly cast as the socially-inept Cady Heron, who as if she were truly lost in the African wilderness, learns to quickly adapt to her new surroundings. The rest of the cast is perfect too, who each play their roles with the right amount of courage and accuracy.One thing that I've noticed is that 1989's ""Heathers"" starring Winona Ryder and Christian Slater has come up a lot in several of the reviews that I've read. From what I can tell about ""Mean Girls,"" those reviews are nowhere close to being accurate; the only thing the two films share in common is that the school's social hierarchy in both movies are run by the members of an elite clique. Plus, nobody dies in ""Mean Girls""; in ""Heathers,"" Christian Slater's character murdered several people in cold blood. And ""Heathers"" was a satire, not an all-out comedic fest like ""Mean Girls."" But one thing I am certain on, ""Mean Girls"" is sure to join the ranks of ""Heathers"" in a few years.""Mean Girls"" - 10/10",Mean Girls

However, many of us that did these ""Mean Girls"" were pleasantly surprised. For the aforementioned & many other reasons, I will not be mean to ""Mean Girls"" in this review. Lindsay Lohan's performance as Cady, the Africa-raised exchange student who experiences a school system for the first time, was quite a Lohan hands-on thespian effort. Speaking of hands-on, I am sure many of us male creatures would adore applying our own hands-on skills on Lindsay. Anyway, Ms. Lohan has proved that not only can she look good but can sure act also. ""Mean Girls"" focuses on Cady's relationships with numerous high schools cliques predominately ""The Plastics"" or otherwise known as ""The Mean Girls"". Tina Fey, of ""Saturday Night Live"", wrote the clever screenplay and even co-starred as the free spirit who indirectly guides Cady's fate. You should ""update"" your ""weekend"" activities and check out Fey's charismatic performance. The film was a box office hit and the studio most certainly will release a sequel ""Mean Girls 2"" starring Courtney Love, Aileen Wuornos, and Naomi Campbell.

56,drqshadow-reviews,"Not Transcendent, But Witty and Extremely Quote-Worthy",7,31 August 2013,"A good, steady satire of teen popularity and social cliques from the mind of Tina Fey. Like the best of its SNL siblings it's endlessly quotable and wears its heart on its sleeve, though it's not as rapid-fire funny as elder statesmen like Wayne's World or Tommy Boy. A fresh-faced Lindsay Lohan takes the leading role where it's meant to go, but stops short of adding anything to the production. That's probably best left in the hands of her co-stars, anyway; a waspy trio of entitled blonde brats who are satisfyingly, but not irredeemably, malevolent. Former castmates Fey, Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler are all excellent in supporting roles, but refuse to overshadow the young leads.

She quickly makes friends with a couple outcasts before being lured into a clique of girls who take here under their wing. This movie was a laugh fest all the way through, and I thought it was perfectly cast. It makes you think about what kids go through in high school and the need to fit in.

And omg don't even get me started on Tina and Amy! They are both freaking amazing in their roles! And Tina really did a great job with writing this masterpiece! I mean after all without her writing we wouldn't have mean girls. The dialogue is absolutely hilarious, and it's very clever too, which is kinda uncommon for a typical teenage movie. Also, Amanda Seyfried was really spot on with the dumb ditzy typical blonde character, she was amusing and refreshing in the movie.

It is a cheap ass version of Clueless about someone (Lohan) who seems like a b!tch before she even gets to high school only to be corrupted by the Plastics and in large part her ""Friends"" and made in to an Uber cow. Why she also falls for the gayest guy in school Aaron (Jonathan Bennett) I'll never know.

63,rbverhoef,Great fun,8,21 November 2004,"'Mean Girls' is a terrific teenage comedy with a heart on the right place. It stars teen star Lindsay Lohan, the mature looking girl who wants played the twins in 'The Parent Trap'. She plays Cady Heron a girl who used to live in Africa, is home-schooled and now goes to a school for the first time. She becomes friends with Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan), who tells her who is who in the school, and Damian (Daniel Franzese). She points out a group of girl as the ""Plastics"", not the nicest girls in school, but popular because they look good. Cady joins their group, first to laugh about them with Janis, later because she really starts to like them. She becomes like their leader Regina (Rachel McAdams), making sure people start liking her less. In the meanwhile she has a crush on Aaron (Jonathan Bennett), a guy with whom she has maths. She is a great student but messes things up in purpose so Aaron can help her.This is the set-up for this very funny high school comedy, although we are pretty far in the story already. Of course we know it will all end well, but that does not mean the story itself is really predictable. There are wonderful moments where you think what will happen next and then something close to the opposite happens. A particular moment that involves Regina comes to mind; I will not spoil it for you, but you will recognize the scene I mean. Even the title is not there for things you might think. I actually thought the so-called Plastics would be the ""mean girls"", but in a way all starring girls are mean; Regina, her two sidekicks Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) and Karen (Amanda Seyfried), Janis and Cady herself. There is even a scene where a teacher is pretty mean, although she has a perfect right to be.This teacher is played by Tina Fey, who also wrote the screenplay. She did a very good job as a screenwriter, but also as an actress. The best scenes are hers. In fact, all the actors do a pretty good job here. The principal is played by Tim Meadows and he is a believable one. Of course it is also the screenplay that makes him this character, but Meadows handles it with the right touch. It is funny that Rachel McAdams is ten years older than Lindsay Lohan but they look around the same age, both playing their characters kind of the same way. I like Lohan as an actress; compared to another teen star like Hilary Duff she is a young woman who really creates a character. Here she is perfect, perfect looking for that matter, in a great movie.

65,vertigo_14,Welcome to the Jungle! (spoilers),7,17 July 2004,"Though often only moderately funny on Saturday Night Live, ""Mean Girls"" writer Tina Fey (adapting Rosalind Wiseman's book), struck upon something quite good in an attempt to convey a feminist message to younger female audiences. It seems like a project that Amy Heckerling (director of Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Clueless) might've taken on, though the movie tends to lack in more serious and sentimental moments, sometimes going too far to press a point whereas Heckerling often seemed to add just the right amount of everything. Set against themes of the jungle (it is no coincidence that the high school mascot is The Lions), the movie explores the viciousness of high school-aged girls who have forgotten how to behave with civility towards one another. The arrangement is your typical high school caste system, but those who occupy all levels of the competitive food chain in this film are primarily female.Lohan plays Cady Heron (there's a running gag where people mispronounce her name), who is the center of our story. She is entering public school for the first time, having been home-schooled all of her life while her parents, archaeologists, were working in Africa. High school life is alienating for the newcomer, despite her best attempts to 'adapt.' Though, she does manage to befriend two loners--Janice (the stereotypical goth-art girl) and the token gay friend, Damien, and their minute social status on campus allow them to realize how the caste system is arranged (although anyone under the most popular kids seem to aware of how things work). Janice and Damien are like a more comical version of Gavin and UV of the movie 'Disturbing Behavior.' (This movie does not stray from stereotypes, but then again, neither does real high school).Enter the queen of the jungle, Regina George, the untouchable popular girl, and her two lackeys, Gretchen Wieners and Karen Smith, who form the untouchable 'Plastics' that occupy the top of the high school food chain. They are simultaneously loathed and loved by the remaining high school girls (except for Janice) and really keep everyone on their toes. (The 'Plastics' are comparable to 'The Blue Ribbons' of Disturbing Behavior). They take on Cady as a pet project, probably sensing that from her absence of classifiable style, that the impressionable newcomer, polite and quiet, can be properly molded into one of the dreaded, self-obsessed 'Plastics.' This may seem like something to fear, losing an innocent kid to the wolves, but Janice senses an opportunity, wanting very much to bring down Regina George and all that she stands for. The ideal end: a school with no ultra-popular hierarchy. So, Cady agrees, and she becomes on of 'The Plastics.'It may seem temporary, but as Cady's involvement with the plastics continues, she eerily begins to resemble one of them. Backstabbing, self-centered, ultra-beautiful, and hopelessly sadistic (but remember that in stories like this, our hero never fully transforms, and there is always that conscious well-meaning person there that just needs some coaxing, often through some difficult challenge). Well, the three friend's plans to sabotage 'The Plastics' sort of backfires. Cady falls for Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes Regina quite jealous, and eager to deceive her friend. As a result, Cady starts falling out of the loop, and initiates plans to fight back. But, as she attempts to knock Regina out of the top of the food chain, she gradually becomes her(Gretchen and Karen, the other two, are natural lackeys, not leaders). As such, she abandons everything that made her decent to begin with. Regina doesn't go down without a fight either, knowing how powerful leader of the 'Plastics' is. So, there is a war between her and the new trio of Plastics (with Cady as leader), creating something so tense that it soon blows up to create a war among all in the jungle (the entire junior female student body). Yada, yada, yada, Cady learns a harsh lesson about how ridiculous the whole thing is, and how she completely lost sense of who she is by instead, parading around with this phony personality and everything else. The force of 'The Plastics' is a very difficult thing to fight off. And the ending does so, rather ridiculously and certainly, unrealistically, including a brief female student bonding session in the gym and a tearful moralistic finale at the school dance (of course, they always end teen movies at a school dance). Overall, the movie is hilarious, going beyond the typical stupid sexual humor of most of the modern teen fare out there. Though it doesn't absolutely lack it, either. But, it is definitely more intelligent and yes, actually has a pretty significant message for young females. However, the movie does tend to try to go too far in getting it's message out. By half-way in the movie, you should realize that it is more than just another typical story about a not-so-popular kid trying to be popular. Except, towards the end (leading to the public unveiling of the 'Burn Book' and everything after that) tries to go too far in getting it's feminist message out there and then trying to resolve it with one big sort of Brady Bunch styled ending where all the girls become good friends and the detrimental hierarchy of 'Plastics' disbands (though the hierarchy doesn't disappear altogether). The first half of the movie turned out to be better than the second half, before Cady becomes a full-fledged Plastic, because by that point, the story becomes so indulgent with moments of revenge that becomes so excessive, it turns the rest of the story into something too unbelievable. But overall, it turned out to be better than expected. If young girls want to see a decent movie released recently, skip that horrible anti-independence trash like Sleepover and Cinderella, and check out Mean Girls. Especially, high school girls. Hopefully, you'll learn something about the stupidity of high school social drama.",Mean Girls
66,triple8,"The good, the bad and the just plain mean-excellent movie.",9,1 May 2004,"Mean Girls is all inclusive and what I mean by that is contrary to what one may think, you don't have to be a teenage to relate to this. I just saw this movie tonight and was blown away by how, more then just being good, how utterly ACCURATE it was. This is a movie that may have a target audience of teen girls but is really timeless in who it may appeal to. I believe this is a must see for any female-and some guys may like it to.This movie got so many things right I don't know where to begin. There are a million movies that ineffectively try to capture the angst of high school. Mean Girls works on many levels, but number one is the dialogue. I nearly got goosbumps watching this, because many of the things done and said are so close in reality to what occurs it's really surprising. There isn't anything that's unrealistic about this, particularly in the conversations. Female cliques are nailed down so perfectly here it's a bit scary.Having been in both the ""in"" and the ""out"" at different times in my life, I can say without a doubt that Lindsey creates a character that's extremely relatable in Caty. I think many if not most people can relate to the turmoil and different feelings Caty goes through. When one is a teenager there probably isn't anything more important in life then being accepted. Fitting in and being liked are almost a necessity for teenage girls-and boys for that matter. But unlike with many males, there is another aspect to fitting in with females and that's the whole catty aspect. You have to not just fit in, but be looked up to. Girls have a cattiness that's often lacking in boys and that is what this movie picks up on so accurately. The ""betrayal"" aspect is explored so this is not just a movie about cliques but about loss and betrayal when the people who do accept and embrace you suddenly turn on you.This movie will not only be relatable in regards to experiences had in high school, but rather in reference to similar experiences had at any age in any aspect of life-be that work, family or toxic friendships. Hopefully, all ages of people will come out to see this one because whether you are 17 or 70 it is more then likely you have been a victim of a ""razzle dazzle"" person, been that person yourself or wanted to be that person. All those situations are explored here and there are many scenes here that are very much grounded in reality. For example-WARNING: SPOILER: The whole concept of telling someone they look nice and then turning around and saying how ugly they looked.The whole thing with the ""she said, she said"" on the phone.The whole thing with writing nasty things about people in yearbooks.Oh I could go on and on-the point is these are real situations that happen-I know they happen. I have seen all the situations just descibed happen at one time or another.I like movies that are based in reality and that also make you think. Mean Girls is a good movie. An excellent one actually and a must see. 9 out of 10.",Mean Girls
67,TheOneThatYouWanted,Lohan needs to make a comeback,7,1 February 2017,"They were talking about this movie on ScreenJunkies and I've noticed over the years it has become part of our pop-culture lexicon; so I finally bit the bullet and checked it out. It is a good comedy. It could have been a great comedy if the second half of the film didn't go into the strange and unrealistic realm of group-help? Yeah, it was a little like, what movie am I watching now kind of deal. Anyway, the film is about an outsider who joins the cool kids and then the movie transforms into one big emotional hug and a ""there are no bad guys, we are all winners!"", kind of BS. But I see why this film is remembered, for its first half. Oh, on a funny note, the mean girls stuff happens when you're an adult too and no matter your sex. A few months ago someone totally did the phantom conference call to me in a professional setting, I was just happy I didn't talk smack about whoever.. mainly because I didn't trust the guy calling me. So yeah, I would recommend this film more so for educational purposes and pop-culture lingo than comedic entertainment. Oh, and Lindsay Lohan is great in this. We need Lindsey to start acting again.",Mean Girls

Its nothing spectacular its just ok.",Mean Girls
69,Matt_Layden,Fresh Take On Old Stuff,7,20 July 2009,"Why does a film like Mean Girls work? Well, for one thing it isn't written by hack writers, and for another it has a strong cast (for the roles written). Lindsey Lohan is quite good here, of course there is no real acting stretch anywhere but this was before she became a tabloid slut. Even though the film centres around her character, Rachel McAdams is the one who steals the show. Her blonde bitch attitude is a joy to watch and she is gorgeous.Not too take away from the supporting cast though, Lacey Chabert, who also happens to be gorgeous, is here playing one of the friends who can't help but think that everyone loves her. She tries her best to impress others while not noticing that people hate her. Amanda Seyfried seems to have the dumb blonde role down pat and gets a lot of the laughs.Tim Meadows and Tina Fey, both from SNL make appearances as the school faculty. Both are comedic actors who appear to be guiding these girls into the right direction. Almost an old generation leading a new generation feel to it. The third SNL cast member who drops by is Amy Poehler, who plays Rachel McAdams mother, she is almost as oblivious to everything as Chabert's character is.It's a decent film, that manages to break away from the clichéd genre that it is supposed to be pigeon holed in. None of the scenes are really laugh out loud funny, but giggle funny, enough to make you enjoy yourself.",Mean Girls
70,lewiskendell,"In this case, mean is good.",8,18 March 2010,"If you overlook Mean Girls because it is set in a high school and about young women, you're missing out on one of the funniest and smartest movies of the last few years. I mean, blindingly funny. I had forgotten how hilarious it was, but upon watching it again, I was quickly reminded. If I couldn't recommend Mean Girls for any other reason, the humor would be enough. Back in the early 2000's, Lindsay Lohan showed the kind of talent that made her seem destined to be a star. This is easily her best movie, and it's impossible to not like and root for Cady, as you watch. It doesn't hurt that Lindsay was impossibly hot back then, too. The other main actresses are just as talented, even if their roles were a bit more one-dimensional. Rachel McAdams leaped onto a lot of people's radar as a thoroughly unlikeable (but still enviable) popular girl. Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried also did a magnificent job as two shallow, air-headed, rumor-mongers. Tina Fey even wrote some good roles for herself, Amy Poehler, and Tim Meadows. And I can't help but mention Lizzy Caplan's scene-stealing awesomeness, as well. They somewhat hid it under her alternative look, but she's just as beautiful as her other young co-stars. As for the plot, it's loosely based on a popular book that most people who read this are probably well-aware of, so no need to go into that. My only gripe with Mean Girls is that it slowly bogged down a bit as it became more of a ""lesson movie"", near the end. It stopped being as funny, and started to focus more on the message it was trying to deliver. It's a fine lesson for young women to learn, but it was communicated in a pretty unimaginative and ham-fisted manner. That was pretty jarring, compared to how effortlessly smart and clever the rest of the movie was. As I said before, this really was a great film. A lot of the people who are turned-off by Lindsay's presence, or the fact that the main intended audience is teenage girls, would probably end up liking this a lot if they watched it with an open-mind. Mean Girls is the next evolution of movies like Heathers and Clueless, and it is just as likely to entertain a wide variety of audiences, as those movies did.",Mean Girls

I didn't like the shots of people acting like animals. (Stupid). What was great is worth watching. I love the fact the Rachel McAdams is such a bit**! I know in the real world lots of people act this way so that is what makes this movie so wonderful. However I did not like the sermon in the scowled that Tina Fey gives all the girls in the school! It stops the movie. It turned into a hugs and lessons movie. You can have a lesson without preaching. The ending is not something only a 5 year old would believe. I recommend this movie but when you get into the school gym scene where Tina Fey has her moment this is your moment to stop watching! You will miss nothing. Had the producers had the guts they would not of had the ""Gym Scene"". They also could shown a scene where the ""Mean Girls"" / ""Plastics"" reunite when they were forced to to the Catholic School. In this ending you would see that schools ""Never solve problems"" they only ""Transfer them""",Mean Girls

75,JLRMovieReviews,"Tina Fey's ""Girls"" are Just Plain Mean... and Good at It!",8,4 January 2010,"Lindsay Lohan is the new girl in high school and had previously been home-schooled out of the country. She meets Rachel McAdams and a small group of Rachel's supposed friends. But everyone here in this school seems to be put into certain types and hang only with their own kind and even then there is rivalry galore. And, Lindsay Lohan gets sucked into this get-them-before-they-get-you world.Written by Tina Fey and costarring Tina Fey, this is quite funny in its satire of high school life. Or, is it a satire? If I have any problem with it, it is with its cheap feel to it. The jokes and laughs come, while bringing out the worst in everyone, and in physical comedy, such as pratfalls and lunging at each other.Tina Fey does succeed in bringing the viewer back into the mind set of high school (having the constant need for affirmation and acceptance and the fear of saying the wrong thing) and in developing characters you can empathize with, especially the supposed lesbian, who, by the end of the movie, proves to be the most interesting. (It even feels like a TV show waiting to happen.) If you can watch Lindsay Lohan without cringing (it is one of her better films), then enter this world of ""Mean Girls,"" if you dare.",Mean Girls
76,Tornado_Sam,"""A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand"" - Abraham Lincoln",4,29 July 2020,"Using such a quote as the title of my review seems a bit weird and off-topic for such a movie as ""Mean Girls"" (2004), but allow me to explain the significance. First of all, before I get into this one, I'd like to say it really conflicts me in essentially everything this thing is about. Two very distinct things in particular make it hard for me to rate; two separate elements of the film, that so happen to be polar opposites of eachother. It is unfortunate, but I'm afraid that even despite the great side of this thing, I'm going to have to say that the bad side wins out - especially when looking at the numerous reviews that commend the sexiness of everything.To start off, I'd like to say that it wasn't my choice to watch this golden trash. My English class had literally nothing to this one day: the teacher happened to be mad at her other students, and decided to put on a completely irrelevant movie for us to watch. ""Mean Girls"" happened to be one of the options; ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" was the other. While I hadn't seen either, I knew from the title alone that the former wasn't going to be good. So I opposed this film, hearing that it was indeed trash from my desk-mate, but, because the senseless movie-going public eats most Hollywood trash right up these days, of course it still won out.It didn't take long to see what I suspected was right. ""Mean Girls"" is about a teenage girl named Cady Heron who is going into public school after years of being homeschooled in Africa. Unfortunately, while things start out great, she begins to hang out with The Plastics, a group of trashy teenage girls who are obviously jerks she shouldn't spend time with. Things get crazy as her character begins to go downhill while The Plastics turn her into a jerk too, and she ends up falling in love with Regina George's (the head Plastic) former boyfriend. From what I saw of the film that day, I was like ""man, this thing is the definition of a trash movie"".Then, because my English teacher kept running out of stuff to do in class, she decided to show us the rest of this crap (which we did not quite finish but got to (SPOILERS!) the part at the end where Cady and the boyfriend have this ridiculous and highly romantic kiss). My suppositions of before became a little bit lighter because, wonder of wonders, this thing actually had a positive message that worked quite nicely by the end. Such a positive message, that it turned out to be the thing that conflicted me into giving this a 4/10 (not a 1/10, which would've been the rating otherwise. Although this was earlier towards the beginning of the year, before the coronavirus really hit America, so it's been awhile since I've seen it). And here's where, in just a minute, Lincoln's quote makes perfect sense at representing the film entirely.So what was that message? Forgiveness. One of the greatest messages ever, and emphasized in such a touching way by the end too. The real issue is that to make the message work, the majority of the film thinks it has to present a series of vulgar, disgusting, ugly behaviors on the part of everyone. Language; okay, no F-words, but some other milder stuff that they had to throw in for the sake of getting a positive audience reception. And the sexual material: cripes, the sexual stuff in this movie was terrible. A couple making out in their underwear, sexy costumes, sexy dance moves...it was fascinatingly disgusting to behold how trashy they made it. On purpose. And why? Because they found it necessary to exaggerate everything so that the forgiveness message would work. They present all this awful stuff that made me really hate it, only to bring this very touching message on everything, splitting the entire movie right down the middle. A house divided cannot stand, and a trashy movie with a positive message does likewise.So what makes the bad rule over the good in the film? The IMDb reviews. Nobody, and I mean pretty much nobody, actually takes the message seriously. I see comments like ""The girls are really hot and they flaunt it"", ""This film is sexy"", ""I wish more young girls would be so attentive to their bodies and image as these girls were"" that basically are saying ""this movie is great because of all the sexual content"". Everything about it is so exaggerated beyond measure that the sex-hungry moviegoers gobble it up for this quality alone, and don't even seem to care about the positive parts of it. The movie had great scenes to emphasize forgiveness, don't get me wrong; the ending especially showed this. But because the film believes it has to bring this out by making the rest trashy, the public devours the trash only. Had the trashy aspects been dimmed down some (such as removing all language and maybe half of the sex crap) it would have been clearer. But sadly, the film decides to blow everything out of proportion and wreck its opportunity to make the message come across.In conclusion, this house simply could not stand at all, not in one piece anyways. The bad half of it fell over, and in doing so pulled down fragments of the good side with it. Instead of this, I recommend you check out the masterpiece of last year ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" about Fred Rogers. Same message (and featured in a more true to life and beautiful way), not emphasized to the point of trashing the bad side aspect, more realistic and touching. There's a great film. It's also one that doesn't lure its audiences in for sexual content alone due to all the above elements described. Ugh, teen movies must stink if this is considered the best of them.",Mean Girls

80,DeeNine-2,Funny but familiar,7,29 November 2004,"This is partially a rip off of Heathers (1989) in that there are three mean girls (""The Plastics""; in Heathers they were all named ""Heather"") who control the high school social scene until along comes a new girl who changes the dynamics. In Heathers, a kind of darker comedy with some uneasy belly laughs, Winona Ryder is the new girl. Here we have perky Lindsay Lohan starring as Cady Heron, a previously home-schooled girl whose parents decide she might need some socializing American-style before embarking on college. Lohan is wholesome, cute and sexy, and does a fine job of getting us to identify with her character.Rachel McAdams (ten years older than 17-year-old Lohan, by the way) plays the leader of the plastic pact, Regina George. She is voluptuous, spoiled, vain, and as mean behind her smile as a junkyard dog. She gives perhaps the best performance. The other two girls are Lacy Chabert as Gretchen Wieners and Amanda Seyfried as Karen Smith. Karen is the dumb one. Lizzy Caplan is noticeable as the goth girl along with her sidekick Damien played by Daniel Franzese who is ""almost too gay to function."" The teen heartthrob is Jonathan Bennett playing Aaron Samuels.The screenplay is by comedy writer Tina Fey who also plays teacher Ms. Norbury. She adapted the script from the nonfiction book, Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence by Rosalind Wiseman. What I think happened (since the book was hardly needed as a starting point for Fey) is that the producers credited Wiseman with some inspiration to detract from the fact that the premise and some of the treatment are taken directly from Heathers.Oh, well, in Hollywood whatever works once will surely return in some kind of sequel or remake or as cinematic plagiarism--if such a thing exists.Note well the PG-13 rating here. The ""f"" word is phased out and replaced with some clever euphemisms (and that is good since the ""f"" word really needs a long Hollywood rest) and (I understand) some of the raunchier jokes were cut.This may be a little too simplistic for some high school students and a bit too familiar for experienced movie goers, but a good fit for a thirtysomething mother to watch with her teenaged daughter.

81,Sirus_the_Virus,One of the best teen films. Hilarious.,10,9 August 2009,"Mean girls is one of my favorite teen comedies. There are way too many reasons why too. Mean girls has a screen play written by the great Tina Fay, who does a great job. The entire film is hilarious. The cast is great also. This is definitely SNL's best film to date, though I liked A Night at the Roxbury and Waynes's world. But Mean Girls is an awesome teen comedy. I only have one problem with Mean Girls. It's not that the film is very girly, I can deal with that. The problem is that the three mean girls, aren't that mean. Regina is sort of mean. Karen isn't mean at all, and the other chick just says stupid crap. They aren't that mean, but I suppose you could call them mean. I personally don't think they're that mean. I think Cady(Lindsey Lohan) is the meanest. But the film is supposed to turn out that way. Besides that one problem, which isn't big, I love Mean Girls. I think if you haven't seen it, then you should wake up and smell the roses. Mean girls is one of the best teen comedies ever, and it's awesome.The Plot: Cady Heron has just moved to California from Africa. She has never been to school before. Once she gets to school, it's a lot different than she'd hoped.

82,bobsgrock,Brilliantly executed.,9,25 June 2008,"These type of movies are not the type you expect to watch and actually take something away from it. Usually, teen movies are just full of unnecessary language and sex and drugs and the end result amounts to nothing that is either realistic or satisfying.Mean Girls goes so far above that, it really is funny. Being a 19 year old, male, straight guy who always enjoyed story over action, I only rented this because Roger Ebert said it was worth it. He was right. I hardly and any positive expectations for this movie, and it made me laugh on multiple occasions, as well as really think about certain situations that are true to life. What accomplishes this here is the fantastic script by Tina Fey and the really strong acting by the lead girls. Fey's script perfectly balances funny situations with serious discussion about why girls hate each other and the reasons behind it. It doesn't preach to us, but does send a clear message that this is a futile effort and has no importance in one's own social health.These very strong issues are wonderfully portrayed by the lead actresses. Lindsay Lohan, what happened to her? She is so beautiful and smart and engaging, it's hard to believe she is where she is now. She really does carry this film as she shows how an innocent and naive girl can suddenly become one of the crew. As for the Plastics, Rachel McAdams is pure evil as Regina, the leader of the pack who thrives on ruining other people's lives mostly because she is unhappy with her own. Amanda Seyfried is OK as the dumb one of the group, but I can't believe there are any girls that stupid.The one character that really stuck with me was Gretchen Weiners, played perfectly by Lacey Chabert. What struck me so deeply about her was her innocence. She is not a mean girl at all. She is, in fact, a sweet, caring, and sensitive girl who knows almost everything about everybody. The reason why may be because she is a gossip, but I think she comes off to most people as very trustworthy; unfortunately she accidentally tells most of her secrets even though she knows that is wrong. Chabert plays her with such a great sense of innocence and beauty and naivety, you feel really sorry for her at certain parts of the movie because she is in fact, the most sympathetic character and to some regard, the most likable.All in all, this film is brilliantly executed. It takes an honest look at teens in this day and age: spoiled with everything they could want and more, yet still moderately unhappy. There are lessons to be learned here by everyone, boys and girls. It is funny, sexy, and very intelligent. This is the best teen movie in recent memory.",Mean Girls

I can't think of one film of this genre made in that decade that was even close to this good. Heck, I'd even rate this as one of the top 5 comedies of the decade! MEAN GIRLS was written by SNL alum Tina Fey. Did she even get an Oscar nom for her amazingly witty, insightful screenplay? I bet the answer is ""no"" and that is a shame. The dialogue in MEAN GIRLS is it's absolute greatest strength, but it wouldn't have worked if the right group of actors hadn't been gathered to make it all sing.Lindsay Lohan is surprisingly good in the lead role of Cady Heron and she does a great job of carrying the film. But the supporting ensemble is just plain spot on and really makes the movie, led by the brilliant Rachel McAdams as the main ""mean"" girl Regina George, leader of a popular clique of the spoiled girls. Lacey Chabert (the shallow Gretchen) and Amanda Seyfried (who almost steals every scene as the dimwitted Karen) round out the clique excellently. I laughed nonstop at these girls interactions! Cady is recruited to infiltrate the ""mean"" girls in hopes of destroying their popularity by goth outsider Janis Ian (a superb Lizzy Caplan) and her sidekick, the flamboyant Damian (hilarious Daniel Franzese). This is the best ""teen"" cast in a Hollywood movie in probably 15 to 20 years, harking back to the days of John Hughes.But, unlike in most teen comedies, the adults are not treated as dimwits or shortchanged. Fey herself is rock solid as math teacher Mrs. Norbury, and her SNL alum Tim Meadows is pure hilarity as school principal Mr. Duvall. Ana Gasteyer (another SNL alum!) and Neil Flynn are excellent as Lohan's enlightened (yet still firm) parents; and SNL-er Amy Poehler is wide-eyed, goofy perfection as Regina's airheaded mom.MEAN GIRLS manages to avoid clichés seen in most teen comedies and just when you think the movie is going in one direction, it does a 180 and does something outrageous, without devolving into stupidity. I found most of the resolutions in the film to be simultaneously funny and heartwarming. And the film didn't end in the traditional manner.

Lohan plays Cady Heron, who is torn between being friends with regular kids and becoming one of ""the plastics"". She agrees with the regular kids to infiltrate ""the plastics""; the regular kids aren't so sure that Cady is only infiltrating. This is one of those rare films written about and for teenagers that is intelligent in its depiction of the teenage world, in the choices that teenagers make, and in the consequences that they face. It's consistently funny, interesting, and has much to say to the audience as well. Lohan is every bit as charming and as sweet as she was in Freaky Friday. Rachel McAdams, a decade beyond the age she portrays in real life, perfectly depicts the Queen Bee role in high school that we all love to despise.

87,educallejero,Fun little movie with grown women playing girls,7,13 April 2020,"The movie is silly, over the top, fun, with a perfect fast pace and great editing, a clear and predictable but also good script, full of gorgeous young but adult women (Lohan and Seyfried were 19 playing 16, but the others 20 or over), playing teenagers and ""surviving"" high school.There is no reason to consider this movie less than good, because it plays with all the clichés (outcasts, beauty standards, real friends, fake friends, highschool status, boyfriends, jealous) and do justice to every single one of them.What makes it better than others is how fun it is, without crossing the line to being gross for the sake of shock, or too crazy for it to make sense even in the world it created, and the iconic and movie stealing Rachel McAdams with her ""Regina"" perfect mean girl.",Mean Girls
88,Stampsfightclub,Over stereotyped but enjoyable teen comedy,8,19 November 2008,"Raised in Africa, Cady (Lohan) finds life difficult when she moves to a high school in America and meets Regina George (McAdams), leader of the Plastics.Stereotypes can often be one of those negative elements in films which bring the rating down because of the predictability. They are based along the rules written in modern media. Despite the copycat references to other school and society figures, the teens in this picture are so over stereotyped that it works up a wonderful treat.Lindsey Lohan (The Parent Trap) stars as central character Cady and gives an obvious performance as the new girl. She does look the part which makes the plot somewhat believable even if we have to follow her around all the time.Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) stars as head Plastic Regina George, the girl everyone wants to be like. Attractive, intelligent and domineering she is the epitome of the schoolyard. Juxtaposed with gossip queen Lacey Chabert and dumb Amanda Seyfried and you have a great collection of stereotypes that are amusing.Despite the strong female presence in this comedy drama, it is the male cast who deliver the most laughs. The typical gay character Damien packs a great punch and watch out for leader of the Mathematics team Kevin Gnapoor (Rajiv Surendra) who is so beautifully funny that it is almost untrue. When you see him rapping on stage you will be laughing for the rest of the week.Heads will turn away when the formulaic plot is staring you in the face. New girl at a new school who can't fit in and fancies the one guy she can't have etc. The formula is there for a head rolling bore but be patient as when we meet the plastics, the dynamic and flow of the narrative changes dramatically.There is a dreadful obvious finish but the conventional plot remains consistent and keeps the feet firmly placed on the ground.Cady goes undercover to make Regina's life a living nightmare and the wearing down of the lead Plastic is very well scripted with some tasty jokes and slapstick humour. This differs slightly from the underlining convention of modern day teen films.Unlike modern day films, there is little reference to modern media, which makes it a timeless watch.Based on the factual advice book, this is a wonderful, if slightly over exaggerated, depiction of stereotypes. Despite the convention of the plot, Mean Girls is ultimately enjoyable with a great collection of characters that is worth viewing",Mean Girls

How cunning they are? It's further described, how a new member is introduced among them. How each of them gets the well deserving lesson for their deeds as the movie progresses. The story of Lindsay along with her crush and with the other friends is quite a treat as well.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The movie just runs for a little over one and half hours yet it covers so much. It is precisely made. The alpha group is a visual treat in itself. Acting: I liked the work of 'other friends' of Lindsay. Others cast were justified as well.Final Verdict: How the girls get the lesson they deserved, how everything falls in place at last, and the speech delivered at last by Lindsay. It was all fabulous. It's worth adding to your collection.",Mean Girls
90,TOMASBBloodhound,The unthinkable: A good film in this day and age about high school.,9,26 June 2005,"Though my own high school days are well behind me now, this film received enough acclaim that I was convinced to give it a try. Mean Girls did in fact prove to be a rewarding experience. The film made a ton of money and launched some of its young stars into orbit.Our story deals with a previously home-schooled girl (Lohan) now having to brave a suburban high school for the first time. She is completely clueless as far as what it takes to be cool in this new world, but she is pretty enough to catch the attention of the most popular girls in the school. The ""Plastics"" as they are called take the young lady into their world and over time she becomes one of them. The more popular the young lady becomes, the more miserable her life becomes, however.The film is very funny and it hits pretty hard with its depictions of the various cliques at modern high schools. Some would argue that the characters in this film are just stereotypes, but so are most real life high schoolers. Nearly everyone fit into one category or another even back in my school days, but things seem even more fragmented now.Tina Fey has written an intelligent script, and thankfully the film was cast well enough to carry it. Lindsay Lohan is charming, but nothing too exceptional. Rachel McAdams pretty much steals this film, and she is likely the cast member who will have the best career of this bunch. I think it's safe to say her scream toward the end of act 2 is the best I've ever heard in any film.Lacey Chabert is also worth mentioning, and she seems worthy of some better roles in the future. Overall, there did not seem to be any casting problems.Mark Watters keeps things moving along at a brisk pace, and it seems strange to see Lorne Michaels' name in the credits of any film this funny. From what I've heard, the film had to be trimmed of more than a few parts that would have given it in an R-rating. BOO!!!!!! Hard to argue with the box office totals, though! After watching this film, I was reminded of a similar group of popular girls at my high school. They called themselves the Senior Bitch Patrol, and behaved much the same way as the ""Plastics."" Only back then (88-91) it was mostly about the hair. The bigger the hair, the more popular the girl. All of these girls have gone on to live boring and pointless lives since those days. Go figure....9 of 10 stars for Mean Girls. Too bad I never had any math teachers as pretty as Tina Fey!",Mean Girls
91,Benjamin-M-Weilert,The corruption and redemption of a high school girl.,8,12 September 2020,"With the theaters opening back up again, I took advantage of a few ""comeback classics"" showings to see a movie that I had missed the first time it came around: Mean Girls (2004). I'm familiar with the numerous memes that this movie spawned, so it was a little weird seeing these little references in their original context. Of course, I'm also not necessarily the target demographic for this movie, as I am not (and have not been) a high school girl. Sure, it gave me an appreciation of the cutthroat and somewhat petty social hierarchy involved with female relationships in high school-in the sense that I didn't have to put up with it.I can appreciate the ability of Mean Girls to create a situation where the audience learns about this ""wild"" world of high school by introducing a homeschooled student into the jungle that is the teenage learning environment. The fact that Lindsay Lohan's character goes through an ugly transformation (both internally and externally) a la All About Eve (1950) was quite fascinating in how slowly it happened-to the point that it almost went unnoticed until it had gone too far.Interestingly enough, two things stood out for me in this film, and neither had to do with the main thrust of the movie. First, Tim Meadows' character was fantastic. I'd watch a movie just about that principal-since he was incredibly humorous in his performance. Second, there's a superb bit of foreshadowing that I could see coming to fruition just moments before it happened. It is quite sudden, but I also laughed out loud for how telegraphed it had been from the start of the film. Overall, though, I can see the appeal of Mean Girls, and I only hope that I can use it as a cautionary tale for my daughter when she's old enough to encounter these things in the real world.The corruption and redemption of a high school girl, I give Mean Girls 4.0 stars out of 5.",Mean Girls

Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert star as the Mean Girls! Lindsay Lohan is a must have in Mean Girls. Lindsay's like, the sweetest! Lindsay's adorable and exuberant as the main star Caty and she really shines! Lindsay's very pretty, and smart, too! Mean Girls is one of Lindsay's memorable roles, and probably among her best. Lohan's lead is very absorptive. Lindsay as Caty is the main reason why Mean Girls is so good! While the high school world around Caty may be as fake as the Plastics, Caty's character keeps her world in good proper perspective. Rachel McAdams stars and is too sweet as Regina George, the head of the Plastics, that popular hot girl clique otherwise known as the Mean Girls, who's too often repulsively inconsiderate. McAdams has a lot to offer as a star. Amanda Seyfried is the beautiful breakout star of Mean Girls. She plays Karen wonderfully, I mean, Karen is dumb, but Amanda is smart! Seyfried's the only actress in Mean Girls that has considerable huge talent, and she puts it on display. Lindsay, too. Amanda's so funny as Karen. She's a scene stealer! Amanda Seyfried's the hottest Mean Girl. Lindsay, too! I'm a big fan of Amanda's. Lacey Chabert is a beautiful star in her own right. She actually can act! Lacey's so good as Gretchen, and super cute. Mean Girls is sexy! When the girls sing Jingle Bells at the talent competition in their sexy Santa outfits, I mean...that's the best part! Tina Fey did so good with Mean Girls, writing and starring. She's funny, isn't she? Tina wrote a hit script! Mean Girls has an excellent progressively streaming story focus that grabs your attention and consistently keeps hold of it all while it solidly entertains. There, all done.

What I really mean to say, Mean Girls is cute and funny and sexy, and the girls in it are cute and funny and sexy, too! That's all, and it's a good comedy, too! Lizzy Caplin does a really good job. Amy Poehler and Tim Meadows are great, too! Amy Poehler is so sexy! Tina Fey, too! Mean Girls is so socially adaptable and very relatable and that's why it's so popular!",Mean Girls
93,natashabowiepinky,Mean Girls.... Mean Girls... Whatcha Gonna Do?!,7,19 June 2015,"The only contact I've ever had with mean girls is probably this film, and a few unimaginative plots in teen sitcoms. Nevertheless, I hear from 'those in the know' that female bullies can be MUCH worse than their male counterparts... With all the teasing, snarking and demoralisation that goes on in these little cliques, it can go as far as causing suicide in those that feel inadequate. I dunno... Insults and wind ups you can ignore, where as repeated punches to the face, and having chairs flung at you are a little more difficult to avoid. Perhaps I've had too little of the former, and an over abundance of the latter...Anyway, this is pre-insane Lindsay Lohan, when she still had a career as a singer/model/ actress... Nowadays her antics only tend to put her on the cover of the cheapest gossip rags. She plays a 16 year old who's spent most of her childhood in deepest, darkest Africa, and returns home to the USA to discover a different kind of jungle... One where the popular kids rule the roost, and the nerds, fatties, uglies, disabled etc are just part of the food chain. Being pretty if a bit naive, Lohan is actively seeked out by a group of three pretty yet bitchy girls called 'The Plastics' to sign up... And while it all starts up as a bit of fun, it isn't long before Lohan's sweet and innocent nature begins to be corrupted... (Who said real life can't imitate art?)Scripted by comedienne Tina Fey who obviously has grown up in this type of dog-eat-dog environment and knows the inner workings of the secret hierarchy between so-called classmates, Mean Girls is insightful, interesting and just downright hilarious. Most of the dialogue, whether it be from a spotty geek, or a pampered princess, rings with authenticity, and the film doesn't shy away from showing the harmful consequences of pitting one pupil against another in a battle that ultimately no-one can win. It does get a little too soppy towards the end, as everyone 'learns their lesson', and sometimes you get a character that comes dangerously close to being more of a stereotype than a fleshed out individual.But, for the most part, Mean Girls is a breath of fresh air in a stale, overdone genre, with something to actually say, rather than relying on the same old high school movie staples. Well worth a watch, especially from those who have yet to survive the experience... 7/10",Mean Girls
94,Ruskington,"Grool, kind of",5,4 September 2020,"As far as these sort of films go, Mean Girls is arguably one of the better ones.

95,itamarscomix,Solid High-School Comedy,7,2 September 2012,"Mean Girls is often referred to as a ""cleaner"" version of dark-comedy cult classic Heathers; there's certainly room for a comparison, but Mean Girls stands very much by its own right. It's a very well-crafted comedy, designed to be very appealing to teenagers but entertaining enough for adults too, with a witty script and some very memorable scenes. Unlike Heathers, Mean Girls (despite the title) is never too mean spirited, and it doesn't really have a ""villain"" character - there's a lot of conflict throughout, but it winds up as a pretty positive movie, with characters who are flawed but never really evil. Even the teachers are portrayed sympathetically. Almost as importantly, this is a rare point in time that shows that Lindsay Lohan actually had the potential of being a pretty good actress. Not a great film, but a nice comedy, that doesn't rely on gross-out, sex and violence, but doesn't speak down to teenagers or feels schmaltzy either.",Mean Girls

So many memorable lines you can count on one hand.Despite being old, it's still a good movie and has even inspired Pillsbury to release toaster strudels with the name on it as part of an anniversary.

97,TheNorthernMonkee,"wonderful teen flick with a, not so hidden, view on the world",7,24 February 2005,"SPOILERS If you ask any man to describe something which he can never understand, one topic which resurfaces over and over again is that no member of the male species can understand women. Often in groups, these strange demons of torture seem to spend their lives ruining ours. When they're NOT attempting to destroy a man's life, they seem to be intent on hurting each other. The worst women for this later case are that group which every person should fear, the teenage girl.Often a nightmare, teenage girls are often stereotypically portrayed as bitchy and devious. In 2004's ""Mean Girls"" three girls in particular, ""the plastics"" are worse of all, and through a wonderful little script and some superb acting, we're brought head to head with these most evil of people.After spending her entire life being home schooled, Cady Heron's (Lindsay Lohan) first day of school is as isolated as you expect. Slowly making friends, Cady is forever aware of the three domineering girls of her year, led notoriously by the malicious Regina George (Rachel McAdams).Slowly becoming an outstanding actress, Lindsay Lohan continues her form with this wonderful little film. Supported by some solid performances, she is brilliant as the new girl who undergoes a personality change slowly during the course of the film.To be fair, Lohan is helped not just by some great support but by a brilliant script which retains it's humour throughout, whilst never letting up on the bitchy aspect. With students, thick and thin, it pokes fun at the entire American High School experience in a wonderfully devilish way.There's relatively little to actually write about ""Mean Girls"". Your typical teen flick, it has some great performances and a brilliant cast who provide the punches. That's all that can really be said about it. You'll laugh, you'll laugh some more, and you'll probably laugh yet again. Women might be the devil's tools, but some films can't half insult them. Entertaining fun.",Mean Girls
98,FilmOtaku,A fun cross between Heathers and Clueless,7,11 May 2004,"I went into `Mean Girls' expecting to be completely under whelmed; it is absolutely not the kind of film that I willingly watch, but I actually found it to be engaging, entertaining and pretty damn funny in some parts.Not having seen anything that Lindsey Lohan has done before, I assumed she was the typical preening teen queen (ala Hilary Duff) but (in this film at least) she is actually quite decent.  The story, while airy at times, actually takes the typical stereotypes that are featured in most films of these types and turns them into pretty dark comic fodder.  There are a couple of pretty dark comedic running gags that made me howl, and I really liked Tina Fey's dry and sarcastic turn as a math teacher.
`Mean Girls' is not a fantastic film by any stretch, but it is a GOOD film in that it is able to reach a wide range of audience  some will appreciate the light moments and outrageous jokes, and others will dig the sarcasm and Tina Fey's intelligent script.  It is also well acted and above all, it is entertaining and doesn't come with the stigma of a typical `teen flick', so one doesn't have to be embarrassed to admit they liked it.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, and while I STILL won't watch the `teen flicks', I'm glad that I saw this one because it is probably an exception.--Shelly",Mean Girls
99,jpschapira,"""If you don't follow the rules, you can't sit with us"" (words spoken by the Plastics)",7,21 December 2005,"I was paying close attention to the film and the scenes developed in the school, and outside it, in the field, where people talk. And then she appearedRachel McAdams being carried by many of her classmates. After that moment, there was no scene where she was on that I wouldn't say: ""Beautiful"", andI'm sorry, I got lost in the actress' beauty; I have to talk about the movie.But it helps me. I don't know if Rachel McAdams was like her character Regina during her real high school life, because she must have the qualities for it. If she actually was like that, I personally hope she was only admired because of her beauty and not her personality; because Regina George is absolutely disgusting.Anyway, who cares about a girl's personality when being with her puts you on top of your school's society? This is a question that maybe goes through Cady's (Lindsay Lohan) mind as she experiences the first school year of her life. She was home schooled by her zoologist parents in Africa. Before she goes to her first day, they cry, and when she comes back they ask: ""How did your first day go?"", and Cady walks inside without answering.The second day she makes two friends; a nice gay named Damian (Daniel Franzese) and an artist, dark girl, Janis (Lizzy Caplan). When they skip a class and Cady doesn't notice it, Janis says that they're friends: ""I don't know what I will see in that class, but I can't pass on friends now"", Cady says, inside her mind. We're always listening what she thinks; sometimes in present tense, sometimes in past, but it's her mind speaking.Her world, as it is written, and represented by her school, wanders between the ridiculous and absurd, evidenced by the institution rules and the persons in charge of them. ""Saturday Nigh Live's"" Tina Fey and Tim Meadows are who we mostly see. She is the divorced math teacher, he is the principal, or he seems to be. Their chemistry brings laughs to the project, that was written by Fey herself, based on a novel that, by its title, suggests what the movie shows.Candy comes across the Plastics (McAdams, Lacey Chabert's Gretchen and Amanda Seyfried's Karen) eventually, firstly without knowledge, secondly with the objective of eliminating them and everything around them and thirdly admitting the fact that she can't stop talking about them and that she's mirroring their leader completely, to the point of almost becoming another version of her.That's the way it actually goes on schools; before, now and in the years to come. Director Mark Waters gets it; he had showed a view of the teenage world in ""Freaky Friday"", also starring Lohan. ""Mean Girls"" is clearly another vehicle for Lohan, that luckily hadn't thought of singing at the time. She does what she is required in terms of acting, but the varied talented young cast inevitably shadows her, with the gorgeous McAdams at the helm.There's one very special moment where all the junior girls are reunited in the gym, and professors try to do some sort of therapy, so they can work their problems out. It highlights a human part of the film, kind of dramatic. The moment moves, and instantly makes us laugh again. Because ""Mean Girls"" has drama and comedy perfectly combined and resolved; and that's why it is a good movie.",Mean Girls

101,Isaac5855,An Oscar-Worthy Screenplay and a Winning Cast combine for this scathingly accurate look at contemporary high school mores....,8,26 July 2007,"MEAN GIRLS is a dazzling black comedy that accurately examines the muddy waters that modern high school students must navigate in attempting to achieve social acceptance among their peers. Lindsay Lohan stars as Cady Heron, a teen beginning her first year as a public high school student, after being home-schooled her entire life, who becomes friends with Janis and Damian, a pair of bizarre but sincere social outcasts but also finds herself drawn to a venomous clique of Heathers known as The Plastics, the campus Queen Bees, led by the ultra nasty Regina George. When Cady accidentally encounters the Plastics, Janis suggests she try to infiltrate the group as a spy and Cady encounters what appears to be genuine acceptance from the Plastics, and it is Cady's struggle to maintain her friendship with Janis and Damian and the glamorous allure of the Plastics that nearly destroys her first year of public school. This gutsy black comedy takes the cult classic HEATHERS to a whole new level...the Plastics make the Heathers look like Girl Scouts. Lohan is charming and has a first rate supporting cast behind her, with standout work from Rachel McAdams as the bitchy Regina George, Lacey Chabret as fellow Plastic Gretchen, Tim Meadows as the school's principal, and Lizzy Caplan as Janis. The real star of this film, however, is the brilliant screenplay by Tina Fey (who also appears in the film as Cady's math teacher), based on a book by Rosalind Wiserman, that takes so many unexpected twists and turns and so accurately pinpoints the teenage female psyche, that complete attention and multiple viewings are required to fully appreciate this complex yet entertaining story. Fey's screenplay should have earned an Oscar nomination. Mark Walters' imaginative direction of this one-of-a-kind story helps to make this film head and shoulders above the other classics of this genre.

The problem is that with the exception of the aforementioned snotty girl, none of the other girls are mean. They're actually nice. Maybe it should have been called ""Mean Girl"". Also, don't go for cheap laughs by dumping on the handicapped. A midget and a wheelchair bound girl were referred to as ""desperate wannabes"".

Could it be because Tina Fey and her alums are actually not on screen that much? I have a hunch this will make a ton of money, hell toss in a few Hobbits and it could have snared an Oscar.No, no, no... But I guess I'm hoping it will make a ton of money so that Tina can come back with a more scathing comedy, however after years of skit writing that might be like a sprinter taking on a marathon. What helps here is that the plot is as familiar as, well high school, so she can set up a series of anecdotes like a bunch of skits.And again divvying up the humor, instead of trying to carry it all alone is wise. Maybe Chris Rock might have a chat with Tina instead of Adam Sandler??Mathlete Rajiv Surendra took some of the skit bits and made them integral not deferential. Daniel Franzese based upon this and his outstanding work in ""Bully"" is a person to watch. I'll take Tim Meadows' understated performance over Amy Poehler's overamplified one, but both helped the film. Meadows brought a pleasant eeriness to his performance, oxymorons are funnier than plain ol' morons!My guess is the book is pretty funny in its own right. It probably probes more parallels between the savage savannahs of Africa and the Savannahs and Britneys of American high schools.It's strange to me looking back on my high school now, it does not seem so bad to me. Meanwhile thinking about this film, it doesn't seem like it was that funny. However just like the heroine in this and every high school comedy, I've ultimately got to be honest, I was laughing pretty often during this film.Maybe a more studied viewing will uncover how this is an exceptionally clever satire of our own King George in the body of ""Regina George."" Or maybe not. It was a fine matinee, and I think the Tina Fey-thful, like myself will enjoy this. She aced this test and leaves us certainly wanting more.6/10",Mean Girls

Here is a funny film that also respects the viewers intelligence, a satirical teen film with a heart--and even a decent message. This film is hardly dark in the way that say, Cabaret Balkan is dark, or Sunset Boulevard is dark and the satire doesn't really bite deep, but neither do most of the high school traumas, even though at the time we think that the pimple on the chin spells social doom for the month, if not for eternity. There is much to laugh at here, and folks to laugh with--the adults are not all complete idiots, nor the teens all drooling dopers, but instead Lohan and Bennett capture the essence of teen attraction as they negotiate a labyrinthine social order to find who might really be in charge.

When I heard there was a movie called Mean Girls I thought it was some sort of teen vampire movie. Then I heard that it was supposed to be some sort of hybrid between ""Heathers"" and ""Clueless"" and I thought: ""There is no way that this can be any good!"" When I saw that Lorne Michaels and Tina Fey was involved in the production, I could not resist renting it because I predicted that it had some kind of satiric edge to it. My prediction was right on the money but it is by no means just a satire. There are some things that ring painfully true, even though you probably have to be a teenage girl to fully comprehend the pain that these girls go through. It's not just the character of Cady but also the seemingly popular girls who are looked up to. This multi faceted storyline is definitely a rare find, not just in teen movies, but in movies, period.Now to rave about the actors. This has to be Lohan's best performance. Several things about her character are fascinating. She has led a sheltered life, she is almost immediately accepted (sort of) by the popular girls (something you haven't really seen before, except in Clueless) and some of the discoveries that Cady has are genuinely believable (eg. references to pop culture, she could not have possibly heard about).Tina Fey and Tim Meadows of SNL are very good too, although Fey stripping down in her opening scene is a bit gratuitous. There is supposed to be somewhat of an attraction between Meadows and Fey but it isn't really developed.Fey has proved she is a superior writer and the screenplay is both observant and satirical, although it all gets a little too neatly tied up at the end. Too bad because I really enjoyed the flick most of the time. Look out for Lacey Chabert as one of the pretty girls. She definitely has some of the best lines and she's hot.This was based on a self-help book but it doesn't feel preachy and Fey brilliantly inter-cuts passages from that book into the storyline, without the audience feeling they are hearing quotes.So congratulations to all the people involved in this neat little flick. It entertained as well as taught (not really), but well done, anyway.",Mean Girls

Tina Fey's script is bubbly and witty And she has fun playing the wry teacher. But it's the strong, intelligent cast that stands out - Lindsay Lohan as the naive new girl (Cady) and Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried as the seemingly perfect but catty popular girls. The movie is funny, doesn't have boring bits, is easy to follow, and has great camera work following the actors. It also has interesting fantasy scenes. The big criticism I have is the ending - Cady effectively gets away with everything she did, and she gets the guy. Also it's a world where good looking people win and are the central characters - the film treats people with physical differences like they're pitiable charity cases. It's offensive and demeaning.

113,AvidClimber,Mean Girls — High school girls bitching and back stabbing,8,22 February 2013,"Mean Girls is a nicely put together teen movie about girl rivalries. The girl perspective is kept all the way through the flick and presented in a cohesive way. That's what happens when you have good female writers on board. More over, the film promotes excellent values and addresses directly a rampant adolescent girl problem, mainly bitching.The dialogs are great, the story interesting with nice twists and turns Each scene is well constructed and fitted in a nice ensemble. The characters are well developed even if they're still single dimension. Finally, it has enough laughs to keep us smiling.One particularity that is pretty interesting and would have benefited from being exploited a little bit more is the parallel drawn between girl-world, real-world, and animal-world.There's very fews things negative to say about it. First, it has the teen movie vibe, however, it's the theme and it's not pushed to an extreme. Second, Rachel McAdams, the hottest girl, the queen bee, is not that hot as a blond, but she's believable.

115,christian123,Best Teen Movie Ever,8,23 November 2004,"Lindsay Lohan plays a teen girl trying to get along at a new high school. This time, she plays a girl home schooled in Africa, whose first experience at a public school is marred by a clique of nasty girls called the Plastics, who use gossip and other torture techniques to try to ruin her social life.The story makes it sound like another generic teen film but this one is actually quite funny and realistic. The most cynical person will point out that this is a cheap rip off of Heathers and they are similar. While Heathers is a good movie, mean Girls is an even better movie. I think Mean Girls is very good for a number of reasons. First, the script is actually creative and smart. Tina Fey seems to understand that teens want comedies they can relate to and she did that with Mean Girls. Of course, there were a few lame scenes but nothing that kills the film. Tina Fey should leave SNL and focus on her career in movies.Second, the acting is very good and convincing. Rachel McAdams offers the best and funniest performance as Regina. Her character is very mean (hence the title) yet I found it so hard to actually hate her. She has this charm that sucks the audience in on her and its so hard to hate her. Lindsay Lohan also gives a good performance as Cady. Her best scenes are with Rachel. They have very good chemistry together. The other plastics are played by Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried. They also give good performances and the scenes that have all the plastics together are very entertaining. The rest of the supporting cast are pretty good and Tina Fey also has a small role as Cady's math teacher.Another reason why Mean Girls is so good is because it's actually funny for people over the age of 21. It's not just for teens but also for adults. Mark Waters is proving to be very good at directing harmless comedies like Freaky Friday and this one. He keeps the film short yet enormously entertaining. I really don't understand how someone could actually give this movie a one. I understand some people finding it over the top or stupid but it doesn't deserve a one. In the end, this smart and funny teen movie deserves to be seen. Rating 8/10",Mean Girls

118,Ddey65,Proof that a Lorne Michaels Production isn't a guaranteed bomb.,6,9 November 2004,"Twenty-five years ago, a movie based on a Saturday Night Live sketch was a guarantee of success. In fact, ANY movie with ties to the cast and crew of SNL was a guarantee of success. Just 10 years later it became(and remains)one of the riskiest moves Hollywood could possibly make. And using a concept that has been done before in ""Pretty in Pink,"" ""Heathers,"" and ""Jawbreaker,"" should rate as a definite no-no. Yet this time it seems to work.Lindsay Lohan takes a step out of the Disney Universe, and plays Cady Heron, a formerly home-schooled girl who no longer has the luxury of life with her parents on the African outback, and now has to deal with a normal high school in order to be socialized. Think of her as Eliza Thornberry as an only child who can't talk to animals, and you'll get the idea. Needless to say, she's not as easily accepted, except by a bitter artistic pseudo-goth chick named Janis Ian(Lizzy Caplan), and her openly gay friend Damian(Daniel Franzese). The student body is run by a clique of stuck-up girls known as ""The Plastics,"" who're lead by Regina George(Rachel McAdams), a snot from a rich neighborhood who's mom(Amy Pohler) wants to be just like what she think all the ""hip chicks"" are. Lacey Chabert(speaking of The Wild Thornberrys) is to the Plastics what Shannen Doherty was to the Heathers. The idiot of the clique is Karen Smith(Amanda Seyfried). I don't know if she's dumber than Tiffany Blum-Deckler from ""Daria,"" but she's not as quiet, and talks much faster. The whole movie involves Janis & Damian urging Cady to infiltrate the Plastics, so they can kick them off the top of the high school totem pole, while Cady falls head over heels for an ex-boyfriend of Regina, and how she herself evolves into being just as plastic as the clique she's being goaded to destroying. And as we see, this is part of the problem. While Veronica Sawyer plots to knock the bitch-queens off their high horses so they can't destroy anyone else even if that means killing them, Cady Heron slowly evolves into everything she hates. And if you've read my comment on the 1981 ABC Afterschool Special ""The Wave,"" you'd understand my position on rigid conformity in our school system.This movie is not unwilling to use an inside joke either. Lizzy Caplan, who looks a great deal like Ione Skye and/or Fairuza Balk, plays as a girl named Janis Ian, who was accused of being a lesbian since the 8th Grade. The REAL Janis Ian, who's a lesbian in real life has one of her more famous 70's hits used as background music in one scene! In the trailers we see Cady use her jungle-inherited survival skills to defeat her enemies and deal with high school culture, and I actually wanted that to happen, but that was not to be, although the atmosphere almost becomes similar about 3/4 of the way through the film.So is this a comeback for Lorne Michaels? I wouldn't go that far just yet. But I will say it serves as evidence that the cast and crew of SNL can still make decent movies. For the present moment, this one is worth seeing.",Mean Girls

It makes the film more accessible and deliberately flat. You don't have to stumble upon every cliché and wince. Because you know beforehand what's coming next. Secondly, I don't like Lindsay Lohan or Rachel McAdams or any of the actors. But somehow they really fit well in this film. All the actors are quite perfectly cast.

1. The comedy is hilarious, with the jokes being well-timed and brilliantly delivered.
2. All of the actors, especially Lindsay Lohan (Cady Heron), Rachel McAdams (Regina George), Lacey Chabert (Gretchen Wieners), and Amanda Seyfried (Karen Smith), have fantastic chemistry together.
3. The soundtrack and score is not only fun to listen to, but it also adds a lively feel to the movie.
4. The bright colour palette appropriately solidifies the over-the-top nature of the film.
5. Both Amanda Seyfried and Amy McAdams deliver great performances.
6. The movie presents heartwarming and intelligent commentary on the dangers of consumerism, as well as the absurdity of the standards girls place on each other and how they interact with other girls.Cons:
1. The characters of Damian (Daniel Franzese) and Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) feel underwhelmingly developed.
2. The scene wherein Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) clearly favours the non-plastic Cady Heron over the plastic version, is a little cheesy and on-the-nose.

125,annevejb,Awards,10,12 February 2007,"This has Lindsay style. I find it to be a warm and happy story. Something I feel a real need for. Yet I am also trying to read it for comments about such as Tit For Tat and Icebergs and Z zero tolerance, stuff which to me is real horror. Mostly I prefer to look to Lindsay stuff for fun viewing, prefer other options not to be there, yet that is also easily possible with this. This comment was started by me needing to say something about a couple of points, including a problem that I face due to the zero tolerance approach of this site, me not knowing the point that is objected to so me finding that I keep getting stuck when I try to draft a particular comment re Secret Of The Andes. However that is not covered by Mean Girls, a comment re The Invisible Circus might fit. SPOILERS. While this comment looks to detail in the story and some others, given the nature of this particular story it is more relevant that it looks to other ways to be a SPOILER. A frustrating thing about actor interviews is that they often try to be polite about the film world to the exclusion of being realistic. Example, the interviews on the Harry 4 DVD, how Emma wonders optimistically on the magnificent role that Hermione The Great has in the novel of Harry 5, not mentioning what happened to the magnificent role she also had in the novel of Harry 4. I feel a need to try to obtain a different solution. I accept that actors need privacy for thoughts and actions, I accept that treading on toes is smelly, but as a fan I think I lose out a lot by how things are often done. My bigger SPOILER is wondering if the Academy recently did a Regina George type hit job via their awards. Very respected awards. Mean Girls is a story mostly about fit people. There are not many prospective underclass in this. Coach Carr is drifting that way. Perspective - the young man who always has an empty seat behind him reminds me of me in my student days. Titanic. Death by icebergs. If this was a real school I would expect a few more but many would not be noticeable unless they were part of a scene, so maybe this is about right. Janis Ian. She slowly bounced back after being hit when much younger. Academy - the way she bounced back gained her massive status among those around her. She is fit and in tune with Tit For Tat, but 'wig from your mother's chest hair' hints of major personality damage. Robot. If I wonder what size people live in Girl World, Janis is a special example of the pinnacle. Ms Norbury and the head, Mr Duvall. These grew up in a different world. Their reaction to the revelations of Janis shows that they do not fit in with the Tit For Tat world, but can cope. * The main SPOILER question. Does this story link with reality? Girl Interrupted was a script going nowhere until it found someone capable of directing and doing a rewrite. The rewrite turned things around. Now I have read the book. It tells me that the real people on the ward need mental health treatment to be something other than what it is. View the film sympathetically to those on the original ward, no problem. Nice story. Nothing like the book and a lot is obvious fantasy, but anyone who can often tell the difference between fantasy and reality re a mental ward, patients view, should have no problem at all. One fantasy is that the film is about the book, it only is in an upside down way. I assume that a few involved with the film will have accepted it as fantasy, that fantasy can have an okay place. The book has a bit that a male might be hurt by and this story was made when many males were feeling a need to hit back at such. Mean Girls agrees. As a male to female I notice that and I note that time has moved on, this incident can now read differently. Mean Girls disagrees. Regina George. View Girl Interrupted from the viewpoint of the average modern sane, no background to tell the difference between reality and fantasy re a mental ward, patients view, then trouble. These days the sane could easily be spurred to criminal actions against the insane, given that sort of input? The sane as criminally insane as far as some minority cultures are concerned. Just it would not be called criminal as the lawmakers are sane? The world has changed. I would have preferred to shrug off this observation, to ignore it. But Mean Girls reminds me of the wider reality. Academy awards 200.0 will have been in a position to know just how insane my understanding is. Could easily be that things just got blown into accidental disaster for Susanna and Winona and the mentally ill. Or it could be deliberate warfare against them, in harmony with modern good practice, an international war. Lies smeared as truth. It is Mean Girls that makes me accept that the disaster is real, but it would not be such a disaster in a tolerant world. Tolerant not the ideal word, I tended to get that wrong, but it is a close fit. Should western governments be deemed to have credibility? Does Mean Girls ask that? Magic Kid 2 1994 mentions emancipation, but it also has Furst becoming a pet.",Mean Girls

The only reason I went was because it was written by Tina Fey, whose sense of humor on ""Saturday Night Live"" I enjoy.I'm glad I saw ""Mean Girls"" because it's turned out to be one of the surprises of 2004. The writing's smart, the characters engaging and the humor clever. Occasionally, the film veers into conventionality, but it's darkly comic enough to make it enjoyable throughout.There are several funny bits and performances here. Tim Meadows clearly has his best film role as the high school principal. Nice touch giving him carpal tunnel syndrome. The four girls - Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried - are a revelation and it's exciting to watch a teen film where neither the dialogue nor subject matter is dumbed down.At a time when most teen comedies are puerile at best, it's so refreshing to see one as funny, charming and biting as ""Mean Girls.""Parents: Please note the rating.

128,tributarystu,Appreciation comes to those who think,4,12 February 2005,"I'm well known in my circle of friends as a rather strange individual, though with fine taste in appreciating movies. I can love classics nearly as much as I can love a silly teen comedy, providing it's not all too silly. I actually bared to watch ""13 Going on 30"", while I really enjoyed ""Freaky Friday"". However, ""Mean Girls"", I do not dig.The major malfunction of this film is plot-natured: It comes as conveniently silly as most of its genre movies, but goes over the top a wee bit too much. Similar to ""Freaky Friday"", which also starred Lohan and was also directed by Waters, the film conjures a very familiar medium - the American college - with pretty well known schematic characters. In this case it's about ""The Plastics"", which, as you might've guessed, are the nastiest, hottest beings distributed in a modern day college. And we've also got the new-comer, a daringly attractive girl who had lived all her life in Africa and was home-tutored. You can probably imagine some of the things which will happen throughout the film - and, in my perspective, that's the really bad thing about it. I didn't expect ""Mean Girls"" to be anything else but an amusing, relaxing film. However, it turned out to be a more frustrating experience than I'd have expected. The plot doesn't amaze at all, it actually felt very sub-standard given some of the qualities the movie has, and, consequently, the whole thing was kind of a disappointment.I'm not one of Lindsay's greatest fans - it's hard for me to be a fan of a girl who plays in teen movies, no matter how good they are. And here she feels just so wrong! It's definitely stupid, I know, but it's just this idiotic feeling I get. Some could say that the reason for my judgment is of pure physical nature and maybe it is, but it's not exactly what you'd be thinking of: this film (as well as in FF) lets her slip into the part of this obnoxiously stupid, self-centered (and yet not truly so) character, totally uncharismatic. So I suppose that it comes down, in the end, to the lame characters in the film and not to young Lindsay.Do yourselves a favor and get ""Freaky Friday"" if you want some (of reasonable) quality teen-related movie (which isn't even original, yeah...) by Waters with Lohan. Or, maybe, you could actually enjoy this one, if you simply don't care about a really frustrating script, with arguably few redeeming qualities.

It being critically lauded by some male cinephiles I trust didn't hurt matters, either.It was full of laughs and subtly got across its points about 21st-century American society and of the growing pains for young women in its high school shenanigans.

It will always be a classic.We are rarely blessed with such lovable characters. Even the characters who are hardly ever seen were great. Every character was different and had there own personality. Every student has there moment that made me laugh and surprisingly the teachers have there moments as well.This movie realistically portrays how mean some teenage girls are. This is really what it is like growing up as a teenage girl.There isn't one scene in the movie where i wasn't laughing.

134,Ronin47,Darkly clever high school comedy (***),7,8 June 2004,"""Mean Girls"" is the third movie in the past month to take huge influence from an 80's classic. First, there was ""The Girl Next Door"" which borrowed from ""Risky Business"" with generally good but not great results. Then came ""13 Going On 30"", a female version of ""Big"", and it was terrific. Now comes a new ""Heathers"" for the '00's in the form of ""Mean Girls"", and while it has a couple problems, it's mostly a very clever satire of teen life.
Lindsay Lohan, fresh off last year's highly entertaining ""Freaky Friday"" remake, stars as Cady Heron, a teenage girl who's been homeschooled her whole life in Africa, but now that her parents have had to move back to the states, she has to enter public school. Shy and awkward, she is befriended by two ""unpopular"" kids, punky Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and gay Damian (Daniel Franzese, from ""Bully"").
Then, because of her natural prettiness, she is sought out by ""the Plastics"", a group of 3 extremely shallow girls who rule the school, under the cruel leadership of Regina (Rachel McAdams). She considers joining their group for a time, until Regina selfishly betrays her, and then with the help of Janis and Damian, decides to destroy the Plastics' ""organization"" from the inside out. Very, very sharply written by Tina Fey from ""Saturday Night Live"" (she's the extremely witty ""news anchor"" who co-hosts ""Weekend Update"" with Jimmy Fallon), ""Mean Girls"" might get a little thin in the middle, but for the most part it's very smart, very dark, and very funny. The performances are uniformly good as well, with Lohan, Caplan and Franzese being standouts, as well as Fey herself as a teacher, and several of her SNL peers (Tim Meadows, Ana Gasteyer, Amy Poehler) pop up in funny roles.
It may not be as satisfying as ""Clueless"" (another movie it takes influence from) or quite as haunting as ""Heathers"", but it's definitely worth the price of a ticket.",Mean Girls

137,jrfranklin01,Good Teen Tale,7,20 December 2004,"I'm not into love stories or the so called, ""Chick Flicks"", nor do I care much for teen comedies. One of my friends rented this movie and brought it over. He has a thing for the lead, Lindsay Lohan. I think he's crazy, as she's WAY too young for him. Anyway, I sat down for about ninety minutes of what I thought was going to be cinematic torture. Thirty minutes into the film I had changed my mind. Don't get me wrong, I still thought I was the wrong demographic, but I admired ""Mean Girls"" message nonetheless.After being home-schooled her whole life, teen Cady Heron (Lohan) is enrolled in public school. This part of the film I could empathize with since I was home-schooled myself (7th and 8th grade). Cady tries hard to fit in with everyone. But being brought up in a different culture, she doesn't understand the other students' peculiarities and perspectives. She no sooner begins to fit in with a couple of ""odd"" characters before she is recognized for her beauty by a pretentious all-girl trio known as The Plastics. And Cady, caught between two different groups of people, gets sandwiched in the middle in her efforts to ""be cool"". Not uncharacteristic of youth. In the process, Cady herself becomes plastic, pretending to be a flippant and vain teenie bopper. Her metamorphosis from the normal and kind Cady Heron to the plastic and superficial one, ends up catching up with her in the end, as she risks losing all her friends.""Mean Girls"" is a film that isn't geared toward adults, obviously. It attempts to entertain teens and still try to convey meaningful themes all kids should know about - goodness, decency, and friendship. I give it 7/10.",Mean Girls

She will quickly find out that nothing is regular in the High School that she will go to. The teachers are a bit mentally off; and the students are like a microcosm of the wild animals that Lohan has seen during her African upbringing. Alone in this teen jungle, Lohan must carefully navigate the numerous cliques of jocks, burnouts, cool Asians, wannabes, nerds, and the powerful ""Mean Girls"" ruled by Rachel McAdams.Lohan quickly befriends two outcasts who persuade her to join the mean girls and use whatever secrets they tell Lohan to help bring down the mean girls' reign of terror. Lohan reluctantly agrees; but when one wears a mask for a long time, it becomes difficult to distinguish the real face from the mask.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Mean Girls"" is the scene when McAdams discovers she has been duped into eating ""health"" bars that actually makes a person gain weight. The long scream that came out of her mouth was priceless!""Mean Girls"" flies high above the average teen rom/com/revenge flick because of Tina Fey's script, Mark Waters' fine direction, and the good acting of the principal actors. It's no wonder this movie has many repeat viewings.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Mean Girls

This film has discovered great talents and has become a cult phenomenon, with its brilliant script and acting (""boo you whore"" ""that is so fetch"").
This movie worked because of Tina Fay's brilliant writing, and how the film does not take itself too seriously, while actually being more realistic and close to home than it should. A classic that stands the test of time, still fresh and relevant 20 years after its making!",Mean Girls

They at first seem like real friends and then they seem like real enemies all in one movie!! This has to be one of the funniest movies ever! With all of the characters in the movie there is so much chemistry in the movie!! They all really put their all into their characters and they dialogue in the movie flows very smoothly as well. I will always love this movie! It will always be a classic to me! I believe the reason why this movie is so popular is because it knows the movie knows what type of movie it is and it has fun with it and it doesn't take it self too seriously. The plastics are so amazing and they each have such funny personalities. I'll always love this movie.,Mean Girls
141,dhaufrect-1,"A Mean review for ""Mean Girls""",1,6 December 2004,"""Mean Girls"" is a really awful film for the average adult with any brain power at all. It may appeal to the adolescent mindset. Cady Heron is played by Lindsay Lohan. She interacts with a very tachy group of other high school girls to attempt to fit into a comfortable niche. The script is absurd. The acting is weak at best. There is little to the plot. One feels cheated of the admission fee to such a poorly conceived cinema. This could be described as an epic flick, however, it is an epic failure for those with a serious mind. There is little to laugh about. There is nothing to cry about except for the fact that one is duped into even viewing this flop. Don't waste your time or dollars.",Mean Girls

Lindsey Lohen plays Kady Herron, a smart intelligent and logical girl. The movie made me wonder where Lindsey begins and Kady Herron ends, if there is any connection at all. Tina gave this movie the unrealistic ""everything works out"" ending. Regarding how unrealistic it is, the story went into a total fantasy ending where everything that was in conflict throughout the story suddenly finds a way to work out and many people get their wish, somehow. The movie ending also sent the message that has often been repeated in teenage movies, that putting other people down does not make you better.

Lindsay Lohan was the perfect choice to play Cady, Rachel McAdams, on the other hand, was a little confusing to get over as the character Regina George. Original voice of Meg Griffin from Family Guy, Lacey Chabert is playing the rich girl. Amanda Seyfried is funny in her feature film debut as Karen, the psychic girl.John Bennett, Tina Fey and Tim Meadows also plays in the film wonderfully as the characters. My favorite parts of the film is the school fight between all of the junior girls, the Halloween party at Aaron Samuels' house and over at Cady's house, and the prom sequence which was incredibly funny and exciting to see. The music by Rolfe Kent is extraordinary, even in the school fight scene. The script by Tina Fey is fantastic, the direction by Mark Waters is amazing. The PG-13 rating gives you what it wants. The songs are also good, too.So overall, I'm giving Mean Girls a 10 out of 10. It is a classic with memorable scenes, memorable quotes, a good script and good and super cool performances that shows you a movie that is about social cliques and what happens when girls join them.

146,neenahhh,Every teen girl's guilty pleasure,8,29 March 2011,"Even though it's been a good 6 years since this movie debuted, this teenager film is still ruling strong and it still holds up to its reputation as one of the best teenager films in the 2000s.Mean Girls is about 16-year-old Cady who's attending school for the first time in her life. Two best friends, a goth girl and a gay guy, take Cady under their wing and teach her about who's who in high school. They introduce Cady to the jocks, the Asians, the druggies, the band geeks, the nerds and the Plastics. The Plastics are composed of the popular girls- the rich suck-up, the dumb blonde and Regina George. Together, Cady and her two friends, make plans of taking the Plastics down. And with that, mayhem ensues.This movie has a fair amount of sexual innuendos in it and other sex-related themes. I remember watching this when it first came out. I didn't really understand it since I was about 9 years old. But now, after rewatching it, I can finally understand everything that has been said and have a good laugh about it.I don't know if this teenage hierarchy and all the other drama is the norm for American high schools, but my high school isn't like this at all. All the same, I found this to be a very fun movie. I am a girl and hey, drama does give me a sort of thrill.The humor in this movie is great. They aren't bad puns or awful cringe-worthy jokes. The humor in this movie are just really honest-to-good funny lines. Most of the one-liners that were said in this 2004 movie, are still popular even until now and are actually floating all over the internet!This is a great movie. Especially if you're a teenage girl. The target audience for this movie IS for teenage girls, so if you are one, you'll be sure to love this movie, even if you won't admit it.",Mean Girls

149,clydestuff,How do you make a successful film for teenage girls? You start by casting Lindsay Lohan.,7,20 July 2004,"Forget Hilary Duff. In the fickle world of teenage film icons it would appear that Lindsay Lohan has not only surpassed Duff but left poor Hilary eating her dust in the process. Just from reading the tabloids one could say Ms. Duff should be more concerned about that fact than whether Miss Lohan is dating her ex-boyfriend. Beginning with her appearance in Disney's remake of The Parent Trap, Lohan has shown that she can not only carry a film but has the ability to turn them into minor hits in the process. In The Parent Trap, she was able to play a dual role almost flawlessly. In Freaky Friday, she was required to take on the characteristics of an adult and handled it quite well. Having done two remakes, she then went into un-chartered territory with the original films Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and her most recent outing Mean Girls. Confessions died a quick death at the box office, while Mean Girls has gone on to become a minor hit having accumulated 82 million in receipts and still counting with only a seventeen million production budget.Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) has been home schooled by her parents, Betsy (Ana Gasteyer) and Chip (Neil Flynn) all of her life. When her parents, move back to the states, she begins her first day of public school as a high school junior. High school life being a jungle in itself, Cady draws many similarities between the animals in the wild and the student animals running wild through the hallow halls North Shorewood and does it to the beat of jungle music playing in the background. She is befriended by a Goth girl Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and almost too gay to function Damian (Daniel Franzeze), who fill her in on the `plastics' so named because of their similarities to Barbie Dolls. The Plastics are led by Regina George (Rachel McAdams) referred to by Janis as ""evil in human form that may seem like your typical backstabbing slutface ho-bag but is so much more"". The Queen's court is the dim witted Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried) and the wealthy Gretchen Weiners (Lacy Chabert) who seems to know every secret known to man. When Cady, because of her own good lucks, is asked to become one of the Plastics by Regina, Janis goads her into becoming one of them so that Cady can find out all the dirty little secrets Regina and her crew have to offer. Cady soon falls for Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) but when Regina takes Aaron back, Cady's quest for digging up the dirt turns into one of revenge.This may all sound rather predictable, but Tina Fey's screenplay does so much more than give us your typical teen angst comedy. In Fey's world there is a little bit of meanness in everyone, and being mean and spiteful is not just a character trait patented by Regina George and the Plastics. Cady, as it turns out, has her own Darth Vader buried inside of her, and when it rears its ugly head she doesn't hesitate using it to her full advantage. Lohan seems to excel in these chameleons like roles where she is required to portray a character that has one distinct personality one minute, but changes into something completely opposite the next. In Parent Trap she played twin sisters both unique in their own way. In Freaky Friday she went from being a typical teenager to an adult inhabiting a teenage body. In Mean Girls she runs the gamut from being a shy fish out of water to a girl who is capable of being every bit as dastardly as any of the Plastics. It is an uncanny ability that some actresses can only dream about.I also appreciated the fact that Mean Girls does away with the `Super Teacher Myth' continually perpetuated in films ranging from To Sir with Love all the way up to last years Mona Lisa Smile. The teachers in this film are shown as being as normal as the rest of us, and have the same problems and foibles just as the students have to deal with their everyday problems. Tina Fey who wrote the screenplay also gives a marvelous performance as math teacher Ms. Norbury, who is divorced, broke from getting a divorce, and the only guy that calls her house is Randy from Chase Visa. It's a small but memorable role. Tim Meadows as Principal Mr. Duvall is also on hand, as the principal whom can't quite get a grip on how to deal with the backstabbing and one-up-man-ship which seems to have spread through the female school population like an out of control virus.As for director Mark Water, I have no clue as to whether or not he has teenage daughters that he is cribbing from, but in both Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, he has shown an uncanny ability not to stray into the usual hodgepodge of hi-jinks that would betray most films of this type.I'm sure a lot happens in Mean Girls that your typical teen age girl can relate to. It seems to offer some degree of insight into the never ending anxiety most teenage girls confront head on every day. The rest of us may have trouble relating to the message, but we can still enjoy the film for it's wry sense of humor, it's crash course in surviving the teen years, and the fact that it manages not to fall into the trap of being just another excuse for plastering the screen with endless raunchy comedic moments that in the end add up to zilch. I may not have been able to relate, but if I can't relate and still enjoy a film anyway I have no choice but to give you my grade and for Mean Girls, it's a solid B.",Mean Girls
150,dirtychild,Heathers for the Noughties...,8,22 January 2005,"Mean Girls follows a 16 year old girl named Cady (pronounced Katie) who moves from Africa to a public school for the first time after being home-schooled for years. She meets a group of so called ""freaks"" and hooks up with them - one of them is a big guy who's ""too gay to function!"", the other, an art-school type freeek who a lot of people confuse her for being a lesbian. Cady manages to befriend the super-bitchy but hot clique - ""The Plastics"", a group of three rich, superficially beautiful but nasty girls. Almost all the girls in the school want to be them and all the guys (straight) want to have their way with them. After infiltrating the Plastics, Cady plots to destroy their leader - Regina by destroying her body, her boyfriend and her army of followers. But Cady sort of loses it on the way and actually becomes a true Plastic.Mean Girls is definitely in the field of satirical teen movies (hello Heathers!!). To me, Mean Girls is a funny but less dark movie than Heathers was. Maybe Mean Girls is a bit more shallow - but I thought it was a really funny movie with some memorable moments, quotes and characters. Don't be put off the subject matter if you are older - this film is probably for a lot of people.My only problem with this movie is that it sort of lets-up for a little bit towards the end when it gets emotional (like a lot of American comedies)... but manages to find it again at the end. Maybe the film could have been edited to have made it a little shorter (90mins?).Overall - this film is recommended for those who like a decent teen comedy.",Mean Girls

Watching movies from the 00's in 2015 can put a different spin on a movie you thought was pure gold - the jokes seem a lot cheesier, the outfits look awful and everything is more ridiculous. But this is not so with Mean Girls. It's honestly one of a kind, timeless, and no sequel could do it any justice. Mean Girls has a cult following, with memes of Regina George or Karen famously popping up all over the internet. (""Boo You Wh**e!"" is a popular one). And rightly so. As another user commented in a review, all of the characters have a quirky quality to them and that you can't help but laugh at even minor characters like Kevin G, the nerdy wannabe gangster or Damian, who is so flamboyant that he's ""too gay to function.""

153,heyimmyx,Immy's review : The best of it's genre,9,3 October 2020,"A classic, quintessential teen chick flick with tons of charm, intelligence and wit. Firstly, the reason why mean girls works so well is because it's self aware and is a complete satire of its own concept. It never takes itself or it's characters too seriously, which is why it's so hilarious to watch. The pace is electrifying throughout & there is never a dull moment. The casting was spot on, with memorable performances from Rachel Mcadams and Lindsay Lohan. Rachel played her role as Regina to perfection and exuded a powerful on screen presence as the bratty queen bee. I also thought Lindsay was really well cast as the innocent, girl next door character. The actors had such a strong chemistry together, and they all obviously had fun with their roles. The screenplay was exceptionally witty and sharp, helping make the most of its unconventional characters and offering some very memorable lines. Mean girls offers a fresh and funny perspective on high school popularity without taking itself too seriously, with eccentric and loveable personalities, iconic screenplay and a killer soundtrack. The movie has so much personality and colour that it's hard not to fall in love with it. Highly recommend.",Mean Girls

It show us a lesson that we never ever be mean to someone or you get the consequences. The problems is that some potrayal of teen world are a little bit ridiculous or could say so fake. Everyone in this movie are how can i say, that was too much and it is well, far beyond reality...thats why i defect 2 stars.

When she does enter high school, she is faced with numerous choices, whether to fit in or to remain true to herself. So you can just imagine the road that she's going to take but rather than this being a typical teen movie, it actually makes you feel for a lot of the characters.

158,dudedazzreviews,Mean Girls is so...FETCH!,9,10 October 2010,"Known very well for her lead role in this movie, Lindsay Lohan stars in this bitch-tastic film full of backstabbing, lying, cheating and bitchingand I unexpectedly loved every second of it. Raised in African bush country by her zoologist parents, Cady Heron thinks she knows about survival of the fittest. But the law of the jungle takes on a whole new meaning when the home-schooled 15-year-old enters public high school for the first time and encounters psychological warfare and unwritten social rules that teenage girls face today. Can Cady survive Girl World?Cady learns being part of The Plastics isn't as easy as it seems So there are a load of teen movies out there that are very tired, disappointing and weak but Mean Girls differs from them. It pretty much ticks all the boxes to make a successful teen comedy that viewers will remember for years: hilarious quotes, lovable characters and some funny gags and also gives the viewers in-sight to what happens in modern High School life. The characters are fantastic and you can really tell how much time and care has been put into making them, from Gretchen trying to make 'fetch' a cool word to Karen thinking her breasts can tell the weather. The writers are also very clever in making you always side with Cady even when she's gone too far and the script was written brilliantly as there were a lot of funny one-liners that no-one would forget in a hurry. The acting in the movie is quite simply charming and charismatic, especially Lindsay Lohan, The Plastics and Daniel Franzese (for the awesome talent show scene).I don't exactly have any criticism for this movie except for that I wanted it to be longer. I felt the ending was timed great to the movie, it wasn't rushed yet it didn't drag. All in all, Mean Girls is one of the best teen movies I have seen as it has a smartly-written comical script, fantastic direction and great pace. Any type of audience, male or female, can watch this and would all agree that it's a rare teen comedy gem.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Mean Girls
159,thewillt08,A Sign of Things to Come for Lohan,7,29 October 2012,"Hey Lindsay Lohan, you were supposed to play a teenager then stop, not remain a teenager into your twenties. Mean Girls swept into theatres in 2004. Lindsay Lohan, 18 at the time of the movie's release, played a junior in high school, Cady, that lived in Africa for most of her life. She was always home-schooled but decided to go into ""girl- world"". She is a nobody for the first few days but eventually finds comfort with two people she meets. Cady is then approached by the popular girls, or the ""plastics"". They are basically the queens of the school and Cady was going to spy on them and eventually try and bring down the evil queen bee, Regina George. That is the basic plot line to our story and it is a really funny movie and even though the aspects of high school are widely exaggerated, it is still relatable and entertaining.Every high school has that one girl that every girl wants to be and every boy wants to be with. In Mean Girls, that is the one and only Regina George. ""She's fabulous, but she's evil"". That sums it up really well. Rachael McAdams did a terrific job being the queen bee of the school. Everyone knows who she is and knows her business. She can do what she wants, when she wants, and she uses this power to her advantage. We see this in a montage with students, teachers, and even the principal himself talking about her. Everybody in that school is affected by Regina George. During her first moments on screen she is being carried by people. Under the pretty face, she is evil. She is the definition of a mean girl and completely nasty to everybody. Cady becomes friends with Regina and her two friends. Regina finds out that Cady has a crush on Aaron Samuels, a senior boy and Regina's ex- boyfriend. Regina tells Cady she will talk to him for her but at a Halloween party she lies to him and says she is really weird, and then she kisses him while Cady watches. There is the conflict in the story. Cady wants to get back to her and plans to sabotage her life.Mean Girls is not a good movie for its story line or award winning acting, no, but it is good for its memorable quotes teens all over America remember. Probably the most famous is when all the girls are giving their apologies and then Damien yells out from the back, ""She doesn't even go here."" I'm not sure why but everybody loves that part of the movie and that line in particular. Another really famous line is given by Karen. Karen is the plastic with no brains. She is just there. She says and does the stupidest things. It's funny when Karen does her job at being what I call ""stupid funny"". One scene she says two. Regina is really upset and Karen says, ""Let's do something fun, let's go to Taco Bell."" Regina then flips out and calls her stupid. It is a moment when the audience slaps their hand to their forehead and just laughs. Cady tries to cheer her up and says she has skills. Karen then goes, ""Well... I'm kinda psychic. I have a fifth sense. It's like I have ESPN or something."" Another, wow you're dumb, moment. It's just comic relief. Karen's character only exists to be funny. She has no point or purpose towards the story, she is just funny. High School is difficult for everybody and Mean Girls plays on their stereotypes. The attractive girls are sluts; the not hot girls play sports and resemble lesbians. The Asians are all smart or slutty. The math team is all ""weird"" while men's sports are all attractive. The biggest stereotype was at Halloween where all the girls dress up like sluts and whores. Mean Girls does a good job at making fun of high school and making the problems high school students face. Overall, Mean Girls is a funny movie that any man can say he likes with pride. I liked this movie, I'm not going to lie, being a guy I thought I was weird for enjoying the movie, but it turns out most guys like this movie so it's OK. Memorable quotes, a funny plot, entertaining, but highly unrealistic. The movie got a little unbelievable at times, so Mean Girls does not get the WillyT Seal of approval, but it does get the Honorable Mention award, so congrats to Mean Girls. Go and see the movie, it's funny, a good time, and something you and your friends can enjoy.",Mean Girls

162,darkwizard404,Beautiful film,9,12 September 2019,This movie is beautiful from every angle. Very few movies are able to secure a spot in my heart. This is one of those movies. The story was beautiful and the acting was fantastic. Not a single moment of boredom felt. It was very well made. The director did such a brilliant job. This movie has such awesome punchlines which are famous even today. No wonder it received a cult status.This movie and Clueless are two such movies that had such huge impacts on the audience that they're remembered and loved even today. I will always have a soft spot for these two movies. Mainly because of the theme and the settings.,Mean Girls

164,MsMovie,Mean Girls are alive and well in every high school!,8,5 June 2004,"Every girl who has ever gone to high school can relate to the title of this movie  there is always a group in every school consisting of one leading nasty girl and her little minions. Mean Girls is the story of a teenage girl who goes to high school for the very first time in about 10th grade I think. She has been home schooled until then as she grew up in Africa. She doesn't fit in at first, then finds a weird kind of friendship with the 2 weird kids of her grade. Then she starts trying to infiltrate the mean girls group and the plot progresses from there and I won't tell you any more as I don't want to spoil this very enjoyable movie.This is a movie in the same mould as Ten Things I Hate About You  it has the same type of humour, but a completely different type of plot and is based on a hugely successful novel, which should also be read by anyone who enjoys this film.Lindsay Lohan is great in the lead role, and boy did she grow up some since the Parent Trap movie. I went to see this movie in Orlando because it was hideously hot outside and I didn't have the energy to shop any longer, I had no idea what it was about and it has been the pleasantest movie surprise this year so far.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a nice, lighthearted story that is not peppered with special effects.8 out of 10  I laughed out loud at some parts!",Mean Girls

And although in Romania high school is different, the human typologies met in ''Mean Girls'' are pretty much real. And this destructive path to power through hurting others proves once again to be harmful and ineffective, all while reminding us about some old forgotten lessons of kindness and righteousness in a really chic and charming manner. I love Lindsay Lohan and also Lizzy Caplan, whose character deserves just as much credit.An 8,2 out of 10 from me.",Mean Girls
166,tanelteder,"hello, I am Lindsay Lohan",4,12 February 2011,"Mean Girls is not for people over 25. Maybe even 20. It's so silly that makes even a bit funny. There are some quite comical moments. That's simple humour. That kind of style that doesn't make you laugh. But it sometimes puts a strange grin on your lovely face. Teenagers probably love this one. Well, I'm not a teenager. So it's pretty obvious I don't fancy it. Still, if you wanna see some beautiful girls (Rachel McAdams) or not so beautiful girls (Lindsay Lohan), then you could give it a go-ahead. Otherwise, skip it. It's not worth it.The movie reminded me a hilarious scene from famous Jeff Dunham show with Achmed. When I saw Lindsay Lohan on screen, the line 'hello, I am Lindsay Lohan' by Achmed the Dead Terrorist, came up to my mind and it followed throughout the movie. If you have seen the video (probably have), then it might happen to you too.",Mean Girls

Unfortunately, it wasn't.I liked the concept of the 'plastics', because every school has them, and it showed how shallow the people I hated were. But at the same time, Cady turning plastic sorta ruined it for me. It was mainly the storyline I didn't like much - I felt it was all over the place.Regina is a character that you love to hate, and I think McAdams played her really well, and I think throughout the movie, you grew to love Gretchen and Karen. I think this was the ideal movie for Lohan though - the role suited her really well, though what annoyed me was how it seems that she needs to sing in every film she's in, especially with her bad rendition of Jingle Bell Rock.",Mean Girls
168,moonmonday,"Unoriginal, Unfunny, Unfun",1,25 May 2014,"Mean Girls is a shameless ripoff of Heathers and Jawbreaker. Period. The parts that actually manage to be original are disgusting and repulsive, and overall it's not only a disgraceful film for anyone, but it's also deplorable for not managing to make the statement it seems to think it's making. I'd also like to point out that its treatment of actual GLBTQ characters is disgusting, and naturally the single openly gay character is treated as a joke and never gets even someone to dance with. Classy.The dialogue is lacking. The characters are pathetic. The script needed multiple rewrites that it simply didn't get. And the acting just didn't manage to elevate it above the sub-mediocrity that it achieved. Anyone who praised this as a seminal work must not have seen Heathers or Jawbreaker; that is all.It is 'Heathers-Lite'. It is 'Jawbreaker-Lite'. It never dared to do anything interesting or worthwhile, yet it attempted to escalate the proceedings to something serious, to a ludicrous end. It wasn't funny. It wasn't clever. No-one with half a brain was in the slightest amused. It wasn't even 'so bad it's good', and it certainly didn't make anyone feel better.This movie is one of the worst abominations ever committed to film. It is so strongly awful because it tries -- desperately, and unsuccessfully -- to cover territory already covered far better in Heathers and Jawbreaker. Yet it repeatedly refuses to dare to go as far as those did, and for that alone it's a failure. But frankly, its script is boring, its delivery is dull, its premise is implausible, and there's not a single character to like, sympathise with, or enjoy. It doesn't let any of its characters claim a victory, and it doesn't manage to present anything that anyone with half a spine can latch onto.In short, it's a piece of crap that wants desperately to fit in with that elite echelon of high-school films that skewer high school...but fails to do so, ironically. If you want to see what Mean Girls aspired to be, watch Heathers or Jawbreaker. Those two films actually succeeded in doing what Mean Girls sets out to do. But never watch Mean Girls. It has some quotes in it that are okay out of context, but the film itself is trash. It's garbage. It's nothing. In fact, it's less than nothing; it's the opposite of funny, the opposite of amusing, and the opposite of clever.",Mean Girls

I was never even aware that this movie was released into theaters in our place, never mind straightforward to the movie's flick I really love how Lohan and McAdams flounce their synthetic warfare over each other.

A really good performance by everyone.Rachel MacAdams is brilliant and Lindsay Lohan just makes her performance natural and amazing - and Lacey Chabert...wait isn't that's Eliza Thornberry?

172,Juan_from_Bogota,I Didn't Lost Attention in Any Part.,6,17 April 2007,"This movie is definitely entertaining!, you don't loose attention in any part of it; regardless it isn't a masterpiece or anything close, i had a good time watching it!. The humor in this movie is well fitted without being obscene or exaggerated, is an intelligent type of humor that complement well the script.I felt also a really close and original way to look at teens behavior, it's very common that young people adapt their attitude and behavior to the people closest to them, or their circle of friends; if they change friends or school, it's natural that they change a little their own ways of living and the way that they want to look; in this i found a good approach to teen's way of living and act.About the Movie: Cady Heron (Lindesy Lohan) is a girl that lived in Africa with her zoologist fathers; she was home-schooled until she came to America, where she enters on a public high. She faces a deep change on her life and interact with friends for first time. In this, she finds her first friends on Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian (Daniel Franzese), two common teenagers of the school, the story get its high when Cady meet the Plastic Girls, Regina, their Queen Bee (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) and the extremely dumb Karen (Amanda Seyfried); Cady adapts to the behavior of the Plastic with an objective planned with Janis and Damian, and she fits well between them. Cady also shows great skills for Math.About the Cast: Lindsey Lohan makes a good acting performance, well adjusted to her character, i really liked Rachel McAdams as Regina; simply the best acting performance of the movie!. Tina Fey, who wrote the script, also acts as Ms. Norbury, Math teacher but didn't convinced me at all. The other Plastic Girls are just fine, Daniel Franzese acting as a ""delicate"" friend is good also, and Johnatan Bennet as Aaron Samuels does good, the character didn't demanded much work, but he did well.6/10 In a genre where's hard to get to this!",Mean Girls

The adult roles just weren't stupid cutout parts but quite funny. Loved Tim Meadows as the principal. Tina Fey did a wonderful job with the screenplay adaptation. This is a major must-see if you are a SNL fan. Lindsay Lohan once again shows she is a leading lady to be reckoned with. Just about everyone you went to high school with is represented in this movie in hysterical fashion. Rachel McAdams is a great Queen Bee.The only problem is that it is a shame this is not a farce.

This home-schooled ""regulation hottie"" has grown up in Africa with her zoologist parents  she may know the laws of the jungle, but she's new to ""Girl World"".While two ""freaks"", artist Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and best buddy ""so gay he can barely function"" Damian (Daniel Franzese) induct her into high school's social complexities, she attracts the attention of the hippest clique at school, the Plastics. Led by uber-bitch Regina (Rachel McAdam), with insecure gossip Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) and ditzy Karen (Amanda Seyfried) as sidekicks, the Plastics even get their own theme music, Missy Elliot's Pass the Dutch. Unsurprisingly, when Cady admits her crush on Regina's ex. Aaron (Jonathan Bennett), it gets nasty.In her first feature, Saturday Night Live scriptwriter Tina Fey has teamed with director Mark Waters (Freaky Friday) to freshen the potentially hackneyed Heathers-lite teen comedy genre. (Fey also plays Cady's maths teacher, Ms Norbury.) Mean Girls is incredibly funny, with some great minor characters, including an Indian ""bad-ass MC and mathlete"", and fellow SNL regular Amy Pohler as Regina's youth-obsessed mother. Based on Rosalind Wiseman's non-fiction book, Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence, the virtue of Mean Girls is that it shows even heroines can be bitches.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie (I wouldn't of given it a 7 if I didn't) it's just that the HA-HA's turn to HO-HUM's if you catch my drift.LINDSAY LOHAN stars as Cady, a 16 yr old who has been home schooled all her life and has lived in Africa for the past 12 years. Anyway, she finds herself back in the good ol' U.S. of A and attending school, high school, for the very first time. She soon learns that popularity is where it's at and to be popular you have to do some pretty mean things. In school, she meets Janis (LIZZY CAPLAN) and Damian (DANIEL FRANZESE from ""BULLY""), two outcasts who hang out with each other cause nobody else will hang out with them. Cady hangs out with them until the Plastics take her under their wings. The Plastics consist of Regina (the lovely RACHEL MCADAMS from ""RED EYE""), Gretchen (LACEY CHABERT from ""PARTY OF FIVE"" fame) and Karen (AMANDA SEYFRIED). At first Cady, Janis and Damian conspire for her to hang with the Plastics just so Cady can get some dirt on them to bring them down. And the dirt comes quick. These girl's take every chance they can get to talk behind each other's backs on the phone with 3 way calling. They also write mean things about other people in what they call the ""Burn Book"" and that soon lands some of them in trouble. Cady also finds herself falling for Aaron Samuels (JONATHAN BENNET), Regina's ex, and that's a no-no. Things go down hill fast for this group of, in my opinion, losers themselves. Cady starts acting like the Plastics herself and everyone starts hating her. But, of course, there is a happy ending.I don't think Regina getting hit by the bus was necessary. This could of been in the book but I wouldn't know cause I have never read it and have no intentions to do so. Still, give it a go. There are worse movies out there.",Mean Girls

The director also slips in lovely grace notes, such as a subtle homage to Carrie.This achievement is even more remarkable given the necessity of working around Lindsay Lohan's acting inability, and lack of screen radiance.The supporting cast however, including Fey, are almost all excellent and elevate the comedy around Lohan's woodenness and frequent occasions when Lohan can not even muster a credible expression for a close up.Add in a bit of laugh out loud shtick, and this is probably the most appealing teen movie since "" 10 Things I Hate About You"" ( which excelled on the wings of its star, Julia Stiles, not in spite of the star, so ""Mean Girls"" is exceptional).",Mean Girls

In that HS, she meets ""The Plastics"" a group of high strung women who at first befriend her but soon show their true colours when Cady falls in love with the ex-boyfriend of one of the Plastics.I was actually looking forward to seeing this film as there were rather good reviews. First they were saying that it was not your ordinary ""teeny bopper film"". Also lot of people were raving about how funny it was. I'm not too sure I would agree with that completely but nonetheless it's a funny movie. I guess I just set my expectations too high that I found some of the jokes rather dull and unoriginal.I thought the story was ordinary sometimes looking a little silly especially with those little parodies of humans acting like the wild beasts of the jungle.I thought Rachel McAdams played out her role as the rich, spoiled, ...... sorry for using the term mean girl really well. She really can play these types of characters and I am rather interested to see how she does in her next movie ""The Notebook"" where she will be playing the exact opposite of this character.

183,StartingAllOver14,My review of Mean Girls,7,11 July 2009,"If you're looking for a frisky and entertaining teen movie, ""Mean Girls"" could be a right choice. Despite it's not my personal favorite teen flick out there, it's still a fun, light and watchable movie.The movie is entertaining throughout it's screen time, but it's far from flawless. The main problem is the script, who feels chaotic at times and could have been tighten up and more structured. There are also a few annoying characters (Damian and Gretchen) who makes the film cheesy. Just to be said; there is a lot of cheesy humor in this film. But the plot is simple; it's about girls who becomes friends and talks bad about each other behind their back. Sometimes the back-talking is taken too literally, cause throughout the film you can see plenty of the girls lying or talking crap about each other. Though the situations are exaggerated, they're still recognizable. And the moral, despite being not a innovative moral, its' still a good and relevant one, considering that bullying and lying to your classmates are something that unfortunately happens today.""Mean Girls"" was Lindsay Lohan's big breakout film. She also starred in ""Freaky Friday"", which was directed by the same director, Mark Waters. For me personally, ""Freaky Friday"" is the superior film, being both funny, smart and fresh at the same time. And Lindsay had a more challenging role on that flick, playing both a teen and a mother. In ""Mean Girls"" Lindsay acts decent, but steals the show away with her natural charisma (unfortunately, like most of us know, she went the wrong path, which is bad, cause she was a refreshing teen chick back in 2004). But the best acting part is no doubt of Rachel McAdams, who is convincing as the bitchy Regina George. Amanda Seyfried (who lately starred in «Mamma Mia») is also convincing as the not so very smart Karen Smith. The rest of the cast does a decent enough job.Despite «Mean Girls» suffer from some problems (script, some bad characters, cheesy humor), it doesn't mean that it doesn't entertain. The film is watchable mostly because it's a fun and light comedy. And speaking of which; of course there are some genuinely funny moments here «Mean Girls» have also some really catchy songs and music, which makes the film watchable. And like I wrote earlier; the moral is a good one.",Mean Girls

The movie basically centered around her and her friends. Some of her friends were kind of snooty and very much the ""not-likable"" crowd. The one girl I liked other Lohan was Gretchen who was also the Voice of Eliza Thornberry in the Thornberry movies. I rented this movie to see what all the fuss was all about.

As soon as our sweet and innocent heroine is thrown into the social mix, she crosses paths with Regina (Rachel McAdams) and soon after all hell breaks loose.As Cady is quickly transformed into one of the ""Plastics"", a group of the most popular and prettiest (not to mention wealthiest) girls in school, she falls for Regina the queen bee's ex boyfriend, which turns out to be a major no-no and soon she is at war with Regina. Among the rest of the cast are several ""Saturday Night Live"" patrons including Amy Poehler in a sidesplitting and scene-stealing role as Regina's mom, plus Ana Gasteyer as Cady's paranoid mother and Tim Meadows as the principal obsessed with SNL's Tina Fey, who plays a teacher and also wrote the script.Under the direction of Mark Waters (""Freaky Friday""), ""Mean Girls"" is sassy, smart and it keeps the jokes coming steadily. The movie never falters on the hilarity front and all of the performances, especially McAdams, are top notch. Lohan is a tiny bit dull but she doesn't waver and she carries the movie strongly on her shoulders. This is probably her signature performance to date.

Well, Mean Girls is one of the few movies that pulls this off.High school is never accuratly depicted and this is no exception. The movie uses stereotypes for half of its gags and the other half are not worth laughing at. Lindsay Lohan plays two characters wrapped in one. She is the outcast, the naive freak and at the same time she is a ""plastic"", teen royalty, the queen-bee. She is friends with two different groups, depending on what stereotype she is playing. These groups are even more set in their unreality than Lohan's characters.However, if you can see past all this, be prepared to have a good time. This is Tina Fey's screen writing debut and she, although not at all funny in her small stunt as the math teacher, creates a very enjoable story from the non-fiction Queen Bees and Wanna Bees. It is suprisingly funny in an unserious way that really is the only way for this to work.
This movie does not work for those who are in touch with reality. But if you are willing (and you probably are) to suspend reality, this is one of the best comedies of the year. ***1/2/****",Mean Girls

189,ElmStreetsLastBrat,A Surprisingly Good Film!,7,9 April 2007,"I found 2004's Mean Girls to be a very good film. At first I had no intention of seeing it as how I am no fan of Lindsey Lohan but it came on TBS a couple of days ago and there was pretty much nothing else watchable on TV. So I decided to watch it. And surprisingly I found it to be quite good and enjoyable. Lindsey Lohan plays Cady Heron, a high school student who has just moved to America from Africa and she is starting a new school. There she meets a group of girls called The Plastics, who are the most popular and beautiful girls in the school. But the leader of the Plastics, Regina George (Rachel McAdams), is very mean and selfish and rude. She pretends to be your friend and says nice things to you but once you walk away she turns and says something mean about you. The Plastics entice Cady to join their group and Cady, desperate for popularity and for the Plastics to like her, accepts the offer. Once Cady is a Plastic, she starts to realize that they are not who they seem to be. She notices that Regina is two-faced, spoiled, rich, and snobby. And that her friends are under her rule. They seem to be just like her but they're really just going by what she says because they want Regina to like them. Cady realizes that Regina is a very mean girl so she does all that she can, even involving Regina's friends, to embarrass and humiliate Regina and let everyone know that Regina is not a nice person. But during the process of humiliating Regina, Cady realizes that she too has become a mean girl. She breaks free from her ""normal"" friends who are just the opposite of the Plastics. She uses guys to gain popularity. And she even humiliates her teacher Mrs. Norbury, played by Tina Fey, who also wrote the script. But then all this humiliation makes everyone who once liked Cady to turn on her and realize that she is not who she seems to be. She has turned into a mean girl all because of the popularity she thrived for. So now Cady must realize that being popular doesn't always mean being the nicest and most well-liked person in school. She has to realize that being popular can also make you into a mean girl.This was a very interesting plot. Although it has pretty much been done before dozens of times, this one was different because it had an intelligent script and top notch acting. Lindsey Lohan was good but I think the real acting credits should go to Rachel McAdams. She made you hate her character so much because she was such a mean brat. She was so evil and conniving that you just cringed when she opened her mouth. You knew she was going to say something degrading. She was unable to be liked!! And she was a very convincing mean girl. I don't normally like teen films like this but I enjoyed this one. It was smart, intelligent, witty, and truthful. It definitely gave you a smart inside look at how high school girls really are.

Literally.While rough, I know it's a message that we all can share that we can all relate to so we can we what will happen.This is so iconic and a classic because it's an ode of what happens in the social structure of school and what it can do to us. I feel like it's all a feeling that we can all relate to.",Mean Girls

It has a lot of SNL Cast members in it and I think them along with the younger cast fit so well together. Lindsay Lohan plays Cady Herron who leaves Africa to come to a mainstream school. Where she meets ""The Plastics"". Although comical I think it focuses a lot on cliques at Schools and bullying.

It may be my celebrity crush on Rachael McAdams, Tina Fey's writing genius, the quotable one liners or all of the above. For me, it's the type of movie that when I am flipping channels, I always stop in watch no matter how much is left. Lindsey Lohan stars as the new high school student in town after spending most of her life in Africa with her zoologists parents. Basically she's clueless to the social norms of teenagers. She at 1st becomes friends with a few social rejects but soon joins ""The Plastics"" a cool girl click led by Regina George (McAdams). There's boys, a prom, lying to parents and all the cliche high school movie stuff except this one is great.

This movie was filled with so much ""us vs. them"" mentality that it ended up coming across as disturbing! Leave it to Tina Fey (the reason why SNL is no longer popular)to try to politicize this entire movie! Notice how gays, outcasts, and smart people are all heroes. While the rich, beautiful people are the narcissistic villains. Truthfully, this movie is ""anti-Clueless"", as the characters who are bad are more like Cher! I don't mind a movie that stereotypes characters, but this movie seemed to make them so unlikeable that you wanted to hate them. Unless you have absolutely nothing else to do, them give the movie a look. But don't expect to come away with a smile or feeling fulfilled in any way. Just a bad movie.",Mean Girls
198,sublime501,Well worth your time.,8,22 May 2004,"When I first saw the trailer for MEAN GIRLS, I thought, ""Hey, that actually looks... pretty good."" Which surprised me, because it was, by definition, a teen comedy.When I went to see the movie, I was also surprised--not only was MEAN GIRLS not stupid, but it was freakin' hilarious. I laughed literally throughout the whole movie. I guess the comedy is pretty dark and wry, and maybe that's why I found it so funny... or maybe it just appealed directly to my sense of humor. But honestly, I haven't laughed that much at a movie in a long, long time. Maybe ever.The humor is really what makes this movie as good as it is, but aside from that, MEAN GIRLS manages to be clever and educational, without being corny. The message is made clear, but it's not stated in a cheesy or preachy way. Instead, it's presented very maturely and smoothly.Many of the pranks that the girls play on each other are very clever, and often very distressing, and only add to both the movie's humor and dexterity. While they make the viewer laugh out loud at the moment they are played, they also add to the validity of the moral at the end.The actors are all very good. I like Lindsay Lohan, and I thought she did well in her role as Cady. All of the supporting cast was great as well, especially the rest of the Plastics, Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese as Janis and Damian, and of course Tina Fey and Tim Meadows. They were both much funnier than they are/were on SNL.In short--hilarious, impressive, and clever. MEAN GIRLS is well worth your time. 8/10.",Mean Girls

This is one of those ""Good trashy"" movies you throw on because there is noting else to watch or you just want to have a chill time. It checks all the marks for a casual movie night, where you just want to turn off your brain, relax and you know going in its not some mind bending thriller.This is pure chaos and fun, where the jokes actually stick the landing, and I must say I had a couple of moments where I laughed out loud, either because of the jokes or the absolute cheesiness of the performances or dialogue. This is just pure comedy gold from the early 2000's and something most people will find hilarious. In the end rounding out to be a fun 90 minutes on a Saturday night.On paper this should be the most cheesy, boring and just straight up dumb high school movie to just overlook like all the others, but this was a fun time with great laughs, ""like-able"" characters and witty 2000's dialogue. It docent win any awards or try to be the best movie of all time, and that the point!

Lacey Chabert is outstanding as Regina's sidekick. Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese are hilarious and really likable. The script by Tina Fey is brilliant and it has been said many times. The script is smart and witty and unlike most teen films it is actually funny. Tina Fey also plays the maths teacher, and she is really cute and funny in the role.

It may be one of the most quotable movies I've seen. Mean Girls was Lindsay Lohan's breakout film role. It's based on the book Queen Bees and Wannabes and basically gives the viewer an insight into the girls' world of high school.I literally can't fault this movie. It's a refreshingly funny and enjoyable teen comedy that can be enjoyed by any age and gender. The sharp, witty dialogue and jokes never miss and the actors playing the teenagers actually look like teenagers, not people in their late 20s or early 30s caked in make-up.This film reminds me that Lindsay Lohan actually has talent. Of the time where she was an innocent teenager and not stumbling around wasted in clubs. I've seen this hundreds of times and it's still hilarious.

202,camachoborracho,Smart Teen Movie,7,26 November 2004,"While Mean Girls does follow its conventions in the teen genre, it is a smart film with a mix of intelligent and crude humor alike so that everyone can enjoy. This is nowhere as intelligent as Saved! - a far superior teen film and social commentary - but what makes it great are its characters (Tim Meadows' & Tina Fey's are the best) and their interpersonal relationships.Some have called this film the Heathers of our next generation...that is premature and bad for Heathers. I saw Heathers long ago but I remember it was extremely dark and intelligent whereas this is a mix of pop teen meets cool suburbanite humor, which isn't bad but the worst that happens in this film is someone getting hit by a bus. I wasn't a huge fan of the voice over which made it seem somewhat like an after school special at times, but the actresses were gorgeous and talented, and even the clichéd characters - whom we hardly see other than snippets of their conversations - had some fresh life brought to them by their quirks.The film reminds me of what the Disney channel wishes it could pull off every time it makes a lame attempt at ""understanding"" the pre/teen ""cool"" culture. It was fun to watch and wasn't too much of a chick flick since everyone can relate, however cool they pretend to be.OVERALL RATING: 7 out of 10. Worth a watch or two.",Mean Girls

What starts off merely as a ploy to learn how nasty they really are backfires and Cadey transforms into one of them. Film starts off very much the same way 'Heathers' did with some biting, cynical teenage humor and a wonderful eye for how high school is. The films embraces the stereotypes that so many lesser teen comedies don't have the smarts to handle and exploits them for a hearty laugh (that's a good thing). Sadly, the film becomes too silly after the first half hour and then even moves toward heavy-handedness trying to give us a bunch of morals and dismissing it's earlier mean-spirited approach. Still, there are some great digs throughout and the cast does a great job, especially McAdams as the queen leader.

This gem of a movie features a fascinating cast, an interesting storyline, and a message that is very straightforward. The flick also delivers numerous moments that are sure to prove themselves to be unforgettable. Lindsay Lohan is an actress that really glows with powerful evidence.The characters in this movie are lots of terrific fun to watch. Each one keeps you amused in a very unique way. Cady, the lead character, is a joyous young personality. I really like all three of the girls in the Plastics ""gang"". Not only are Regina, Gretchen, and Karen are all exceedingly attractive from my point of perspective, but they are also incredibly stunning. Cady's parents are a little passive and boring. Mr. Duvall, the school's ever watchful chief administrator, is perhaps the most aggressive figure in the entire movie. Math instructor Ms. Norbury has tons of persistence, confidence and charisma. Mrs. George is also very charming. Janis and Damian are somewhat apprehensive, pessimistic, and restless. Finally, Aaron, the popular boy, is very sociable and intellectual.In short, I love this movie to the full. It really keeps me mesmerized even when the points are low. Lindsay Lohan's character is truly a delight. Forever a favorite!",Mean Girls
207,doug_funnie,Absolutely Hilarious,8,19 September 2005,"For me, a good comedy movie that's worth it, will make me laugh every time I watch it. This is exactly what happens when I watch ""Mean Girls"". Being a guy, I'm kind of embarrassed to admit I like this movie since some may call this movie a ""chick flick"". I just think it's a good funny movie! I can't relate to this movie, and I think this aspect adds to the humor. But for a girl who CAN relate to this movie, they may just be re-living good memories (or even bad). Although there are a lot of high school stereotypes featured in the movie, the majority of them play off as very, very funny. Some are played out to an exaggeration for the humor. Of course, behind every good comedy is a good comedic script. It's no surprise that every joke was written by a member of SNL. It's great that a teen comedy doesn't hide from being superficial or too ""candy coated"" about the real world and can teach the viewers a lesson along the way. In certain ways though, this movie is not as ""real feeling"" as other recent films out there, adding a little fiction feeling to it (in my opinion, some incidents seem exaggerated for Hollywood). Although I am very sure that things like a mean girl a really out there, tormenting girls in high schools all over.

209,wakemeup36,A good chick flick?,7,13 January 2010,"Or perhaps this should not be labeled a chick flick as in my world a chick flick can never ever be good. Perhaps it fits in teen movies better. But anyways, this is a pretty good film because of many reasons.Firstly, the characters are very interesting and memorable. From the rude, goth Janis to the retarded Karen, the main characters are pretty funny. The jokes are very relate-able as we all remember the crude, relentless insults thrown around and the hypocrisy of 'friends' in high school. Teen life is really portrayed as it is which includes jealousy, betrayal and hatred all in a very neat and humorous fashion, something that movies of this kind usually fail to do. The plot isn't nearly as predictable as most teen movie plots usually are. Not that it's completely unpredictable but it definitely does not follow the rulebook of teen movies. Well, at least for 90% of the movie it doesn't. Although the ending is pretty much the 'everything turns out OK' ending it does have something different which I won't reveal here.One downside of the movie is that the romance element had to be there. Just for once, I'd like to see a teen movie with no romance at all involved. Another downside is that the brilliant, realistic humour is on short supply in some scenes which ruins the consistency of the film.Anyways, this is a movie that breaks a lot of rules and defies conventions of one of my most hated genres and does it really well.

Anyone who's forgotten may say that ""Mean Girls"" was just another chick flick. However, the high school atmosphere in this movie is not too much of an exaggeration if you really take a close look at it. I remember all the various groups that existed at my high school. There were the girls who were quite ""plastic,"" even though my group and I never labeled them in that manner; there were the jocks, smart kids, and ""cool Polish people"" (instead of the ""cool Asians"" mentioned in the movie). There was also my group which was formed by a lot of us who didn't really fall into a group. (Laughing out loud!!) The point is that, this movie illustrated that whole discriminatory high school class system, mocked it, and showed the viewer how problematic it can really be once it's taken to such an extreme level. This movie was an excellent comedy. ""The Notebook's"" Rachel McAdams, and Lindsay Lohan do a great job placing themselves in the shoes of high school students.",Mean Girls

Nothing else to arrive she knows a girl who requests to her to be made friend of the Divines,to tell her the dirty rags of the most popular group in the institute. The film in itself is very very good, its argument is brilliant, its jokes are very funny and the mean girls (including Cady) are really spectacular, in special Rachel McAdams.She acts very well in a role in which she puts completely in it, reason why she does it very well. Lindsay Lohan also is very well, but not as much as McAdams. I believe that the director has made very good bets by the actors, because they all are brilliant. The soundtrack of the film is great, a true wonder for the teenagers. The script of the film is really spectacular, which takes to the public to laugh continuously. When the poster of the film is seen, this film seems the typical American comedy for teenagers, but is not!

214,shevaunhodge,Great film never gets old,10,30 June 2018,"I watched this film when it was first out and was not expecting it to be so good, I was very surprised. I have watched it many times since and it never gets old. 
 The characters are all brilliant and each add a lot to the story line. The acting is fantastic and has some well known actresses that have become very famous since the film was released. Rachel madams plays the ring leader of the mean girls, and plays a fantastic role . She is one of my favorite actresses and I love all of her films . I didn't like her character at all, for obvious reasons, but watching it now, it shows how talented she is, and how she has done so well in her acting career. Other very famous actresses include Lindsey Lohan and Amanda Seyfried.
 The fiilm is very funny all the way through. The jokes are very sarcastic and un predictable. It is laugh out loud funny there are a lot of jokes that the characters say that people still quote now when the film is mentioned. For example ""Boo you whore"" and ""That is so fetch"". 
 The film is based around poking fun at peoples perceptions of high school today. All the popular girls ""The Plastics"" are pretty, but very mean, they where revealing clothing, obviously attracting all the popular boys which are your stereotypical jocks etc. There are also the teens that are not so popular, and have a harder time at school. This would be band geeks or nerds etc. 
 The film is entertaining all the way through and story is very enjoyable. Despite the film poking fun at what people assume high school life is like, and many of the characters falling out, the ending is very good. Everything is resolved and big lessons are learned. The stereotypical life at high school is no longer. At the end of them film the teens are not labeled as ""Nerds"" or ""Band geeks"" and the teens seem to all gel together.

215,psychprofessor,Not so mean after all,8,25 May 2004,"My wife and I went to see this tonight and liked it. One of the best things the movie had going for it was the star, whose name is Cady but pronounced Katie. Actually, she reminded us somewhat of our daughter-in-law, whose name really is Katie. Cady's experiences as a new student at a large high school really follow an arc: First, she's clueless and falls in with some real losers. Next, she courted and won over by some real ""mean girls."" And finally, she becomes the queen of the mean girls only to have her kingdom come crashing down. Of course, the queen is crowned at the end, and all live happily ever after.My sketch is highly simplistic, and there's lots to like about this movie.

216,aleusong,I really don't get the popularity behind this film at all,2,1 July 2010,"I had high expectations for this film when I saw previews and came away from it completely disappointed.I expected a funny satire. It doesn't have to be witty as long as the story found a definite way to stand out from other teen movies and give me laughs throughout.That totally failed. Instead creating a good laugh-out-loud satirical comedy we got ourselves a whiny preachy film that really derives from its own message. Tina Fey seem very self-absorbed when she wrote this.Here's what I got from this movie: Cady was a gullible new girl who was liked by a group of popular beautiful girls . This makes an unpopular whiny goth/punk/whatever girl Janis who hates the popular girls very jealous and wants to get revenge. So she entices the new girl to be her friend so they could elaborate a massive scheme where Cady is accepted into Regina's circle and can bring Regina down.It starts to work for a while until Regina's boyfriend starts to have feelings for Cady because the audience is dumb enough to believe that any popular boy who's dating the popular blonde queen bee is deep down a normal guy who would prefer a typical ordinary sweet girl over the blonde mean girl they're voluntarily with. (Yeah, right!) Things get nasty and Regina has Cady turn against Janis and then more stuff happens and now everyone who is unpopular hates Cady for being popular and all the popular people hate Cady for being unpopular. Even Tina Fey's character condemns Cady for joining up with the popular girls until it becomes this whole big thing where Cady has become the major villain in the school and has to apologize to the whole school for her ""mistakes"".Um...am I missing something here? This whole thing was all Janis's idea. Yet she doesn't accept any real guilt or responsibility for creating a monster or manipulating a new girl and giving her no right to chose how she would go through high school. Instead we are left to feel all boo-hoo for her just because she couldn't accept her low level of popularity or accept the fact that Cady would rather hang around Regina and her friends instead.So now we have another typical run-of-the-mill teen film that makes us feel all sorry and victimizing of the so-called ""unpopular"" girls while putting every effort into villainizing the popular girls and anyone who even rises up to their ranks. Worse yet, the good humor in this film is long gone after the first few scenes and fails to show up again until Regina is hit by a bus (which wass random and a bit pointless but still unexpected and funny).And the worse part about all of this was that the lesson could've been more meaningful but in the end it became so one-sided. The ending (telling us how everyone turned out) was nice and sweet in its own way but the build up to that ending did not make zero sense and kinda ruined it for me. Oh sure the unpopular girls got to feel a little bit better about their sorry unpopular selves after Cady's Spring-Fling speech but it's highly doubtful that Janis or Damien learned anything from all of this, but oh of course they're exempt because they weren't popular (sarcasm).Did I mention that all the humor was sucked out of this film way early on? This wouldn't be the last time a teen ""dramedy"" was written so poorly and end up loosing its own point. There's a show on right now called ""Glee"" that's doing everything wrong by becoming so one-sided and preachy in the same matter as this movie thus sucking out all the humor in the process.And oh yeah shoving a bunch of popular teen sayings into your script does not equal a well written script. I don't mind Tina Fey as an actress but I don't dig her writing no matter how many awards she has gotten for it.",Mean Girls

The ""Mean Girls"") overpower Janis and Damian's plan to get the 4-1-1 on Regina, the meanest and snobbiest ""Plastic"" of them all, because as Cady begins to hang with ""The Plastics,"" she begins to become more and more like them everyday. This movie has the best plot, the best band of characters, and the best setting out of all three of Lohan's three most major movies (Freaky Friday and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen as the other two). This movie expresses Lindsay at her best. I recommend it if you enjoy this genre of films and you are fond of Lindsay Lohan. 9/10!",Mean Girls
225,brettlu,Surprisingly Intelligent Film,9,14 May 2004,"Normally I'm not a big fan of stupid high school romantic comedies aimed at shallow teenagers that are based on pure fiction and only derive laughs from inane and crude humor. And that is exactly the type of movie I expected to see when some friends of mine dragged me along to see Mean Girls.To my surprise, Mean Girls is actually one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. And it also features one of the most intelligent, honest and well written screenplays of the year (by Tina Fey of SNL). Instead of embracing and glorifying all of the teen stereotypes and cliches, this movie either sidesteps them completely or employs them in a realistic context.
There have been countless stupid teen movies to come out over the past few years, movies that are emotionally shallow and irrelevant. Mean Girls is quite the opposite, it's a genuinely funny, honest and positively inspiring movie (and I would recommend it to any teenager anyday over some of the tripe they're being fed like She's All That, Can't Hardly Wait, 10 Things I Hate About You, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, American Pie, etc). Overall I give the movie **** out of four stars.",Mean Girls
226,yak-yak,7/10 Better than I'd expect from a teen movie. Good acting. Decent script. Few caricatures.,7,11 May 2004,"As a male in the 30-44 age group, my reaction to this was mixed; mostly I'm impressed, but I was often bored.I have to give Mark Waters and Tina Fey credit. This movie was much better than I would expect from a teen movie. In fact, the only reason I saw it was because people (both professional reviewers and the common clay) gave the movie good grades.The casting was about what you'd expect, nothing new there. The acting was very good, very polished. The script flowed ok and contained enough genuine humor to keep me in my seat, but often there were long stretches of watching people be mean and manipulative which got boring pretty quickly. Yes, we know they're mean and shallow, move it along please. Though, I didn't look at my watch, and that's a good sign.A few of the characters were more caricatures or phony amplified versions of what real life has to offer, but in general I was very impressed with how believable the writing/directing team attempted to make the characters.One thing I found creepy was how much effort was made to highlight Lindsay Lohan's cleavage. She's a terrific actor and doesn't need anyone meddling with her on-screen presence.I liked this as much as Freaky Friday (2003). The movie is likable but I wouldn't go to see it a second time.7/10",Mean Girls
227,shorty6_1_90,True High School Life,10,15 April 2006,"I am only 16 but I saw this movie in theaters and rented it. This movie is fabulous and hilarious.They have truly mastered the real high school experience. Cady moves into a world completely new with a clean slate. We all wish when we are in high school that we each could have a clean record. Cady doesn't have any bad high school experiences yet nor any horrifying junior high experiences, so as a result she is innocent and clueless. This film covers the peaks of the life in high school. These actresses are perfect together in this movie the chemistry is absolutely amazing. Of course the ending is unreal to actual life. This movie will leave you reeling.",Mean Girls
228,gracegibson,This movie is awesome,9,23 October 2005,"In a world where girls constantly backstabbing each other is a serious and often dark subject, this dark comedy pokes fun at it. The jokes in this teen movie often make people of all ages laugh. All the actors were good at their parts except Lindsay Lohan, who I think is a horrible actress. In my opinion, Rachel McAdams, who played the ultimate bitch Regina George, was the most convincing and this is the one that brought her to national attention. I saw her in ""Red-Eye"" and she wasn't as good, but that doesn't matter in this review. It's probably the last teen movie so far that's made me laugh this hard. Other recent ones aren't funny at all and have flopped horribly, yet producers keep making them. Probably the reason that the box office isn't doing so well lately is because producers have underestimated Americans and feel that people will buy overpriced tickets and food just to see a movie with a huge star in it. However, Americans aren't so obsessed with celebrities that we would spend vast amounts of money on crappy movies with Cameron Diaz in them. America is hungry for quality movies, and we don't give a damn if the number one box office star is in them. This movie from last year delivers.",Mean Girls
229,joekay,Lindsay Lohan and writing make it happen,8,10 May 2004,"""Mean Girls"" isn't a spectacular film, but there are enough good qualities that make it a rather pleasing film for its entirety; something that so many teen movies fail to accomplish (""10 Things I Hate About You"" being a prime example).  Those positive qualities can be boiled down to two things: good writing and the star performance of Lindsay Lohan.Tina Fey's writing can be brutally mean and funny at the same time, as displayed weekly in her ""Saturday Night Live"" fake news segment.  That same bite shows itself in the screenplay, which isn't drenched in a messy goo of teen flick cliches that make watching (or just listening to) them an unbearable experience.  It has a right amount of balance between being a teen flick, parodying a teen flick, and transcending a teen flick.  It doesn't go for ignorant cheap laughs and blunt attacks on the genre like ""Not Another Teen Movie,"" nor does it try to be a teen movie version of a higher-level work like ""Cruel Intentions.""  It pleases the palates of a diverse audience, and it accomplishes it quite nicely.Then there's Lohan, a star in the making.  She was completely believable as the character that the movie portrayed her to be; she pulled off being a sweetheart and a mean girl, and did so beautifully.  She has a real charm to her that make you care for what happens to Cady Heron (her character), something many actresses can't quite pull off in the teen genre.  Maybe it's because she's relatively a fresh face, but the potential is obvious.  I haven't seen a teen actress that can make you care about her more since Natalie Portman.""Mean Girls"" is a film predicated on its well-balanced writing and performances.  It juggles slapstick and subtle humor, dramatics and comedics, and lightheartedness and significant learning in a wonderful way. Throw in Lohan and quite good performances from the supporting cast (especially from ""The Plastics""), and you got the best teen film that's come out in the last few years.  8/10",Mean Girls
230,talullalu,Just fun and classic!!,7,29 May 2021,I absolutely adore this movie it is such a classic in the teen movie genre wow<3 the casting is flawless I think and the writing is good too.

231,nicki9112,So funny.,10,20 August 2009,"I have seen this movie so many times and every time I see it, it gets better. Mean Girls is a movie about a group of high school girls who basically run their school. They are full of themselves, gossip constantly, do whatever they want and continuously stab each other in the back... but there is so much humor in all of these things throughout the movie. My friends and I still quote lines from this movie on a regular basis. I remember seeing this in the theater a few years ago and I couldn't believe how good it was. I am not sure how much you would like this movie if you were a guy, but it's pretty hilarious and I am sure that most people have known girls like this in their lifetime.",Mean Girls
232,bayou_hannibal,"Excellent when it stays cynical, bad when it becomes ""feel good""",5,1 June 2012,"My wife introduced me to ""Mean Girls"". She told me what a lot of people told me: ""It's a lot like Heathers"". In some ways, it is. Both movies are like a ""Revenge of the Nerds"", but when we watch, it is we, the viewers, getting revenge. We are getting our revenge on the beautiful but vapid, shallow, and narcissistic characters in the movie by having a huge laugh at their expense. The protagonists in the movie are not our heroes because they are downtrodden victims who rise up and fight back. They are our heroes because they dish out social justice to bullies and stuck up bitches by making them victims of their own ego and stupidity. Both ""Mean Girls"" and ""Heathers"" capture this zeitgeist, although ""Heathers"" does it a lot better, for reasons which I will explain below.Mean Girls, for the first half of it or so, is great cynical nerd comedy. Granted, the main character, Cady, (played by Lindsay Lohan) isn't an anti-social geek or, for that matter, a victim of bullying. Rather, she is beautiful and socially adept, as well as smart. Her three ""friends"", Regina, Gretchen, and Karen, are as beautiful, popular, and stupid as they come. Mean Girls is at its best when Cady is exploiting that stupidity as we all observe and snicker, such as when she tricks one girl into gaining a bunch of weight by telling her that high calorie energy bars will help her lose weight.At some point though, Mean Girls goes horribly wrong. Either Tina Fey did not have enough cynicism in her heart to make this movie the ugly picture that it should have been, or the studio didn't have the courage to let her write that screenplay. Whatever the cause, Mean Girls suddenly becomes a feel-good, ""uplifting"", clichéd story at about the halfway point. Instead of what could have been a brilliant, Coen Brothers-ish, dark and misanthropic comedy, it becomes a feel-good piece. When you start to see this happening, you are probably best served to eject the DVD from the tray and write your own ending, because it gets pretty bad. The satire ends and the movie starts preaching a ""can't we all just get along?"" message. A totally implausible twist strains the relationship between Cady and her teacher (Tina Fey), and then Cady spends the rest of the movie trying to redeem herself. The way in which it ends is downright painful to watch. Oh, Tina Fey, you are one funny-as-hell woman, but boy did you ever screw up the second half of this script.I could watch movies that accurately portray how horrible high school is all day long. Unfortunately, Mean Girls doesn't do a very good job of this. It starts off well but then it tries to be something that it shouldn't. Unfortunately, this is something else that it has in common with ""Heathers"". Both movies could have had a better ending, although the brilliance of ""Heathers"" lasts somewhat longer, and it doesn't hit bottom as hard.",Mean Girls
233,fluffyclown,One mean movie,8,11 May 2004,"Mean girls was a tough movie for me.  I enjoyed the humor, the girls were beautiful, and it was a very good depiction of how cliques can make people feel either completely and totally accepted, or rejected.  And as much as I hate to admit this, I do believe that every high school girl has the potential to be a vicious bitch when she is pushed too far. 
I enjoyed the witty banter of the characters; and the scenes comparing teenage behavior to that of animals in the african wilds were a scream.  The movie did a great job of developing the different characters, their personalities, and the clashes between them.  It seemed too be building up to a great climactic moment, and I was eagerly anticipating the ending.  But when the ending came, in turned too syrupy sweet for me.  It was as if the movie makers said, ok, we showed them all the problems, now let's fix everything by slapping on an ending in which everyone gets what they need to live happily ever after.  Well, I hate to spoil everyones fun, but let's face it, high school is not that easy, and problems don't just resolve themselves after one talk.  I guess I was just hoping for more reality and less typical Hollywood ending.Overall, I did like the movie.  Lindsey Lohman is beautiful, and her talent shines brighter with every role she performs.  I'll be looking forward to her next film.        My rank: 8.5 out of 10",Mean Girls
234,ana57709,girl world is peaceful at last,8,16 November 2017,"God I love this movie. I have never ever watched a movie twice (not even a really good one) except for Mean Girls. Am I trying to say it's a cinematic masterpiece? No. But in the chick-flick genre it absolutely takes the crown. A funny, clever, seemingly shallow yet surprisingly wise guilty pleasure is how I like to describe it. Mean Girls subtly compares high school and the cruel ""girl world"" that exists within to the Jungle. The only thing that makes the two any different is the scheming, backstabbing, trash talking, manipulative ways in which these girls operate, causing an invisible wall of lies to be the only thing separating them from beasts, and let me give you a hint; the wall came down. We see how our protagonist (Cady) gets pulled into the hierarchy led by dictatorial ruler Regina and her clique of ""Plastics."" The thing that's so charming about the movie is that no matter how evil Regina gets, no matter how horrible she acts you just can't hate her (and yes I admit I am a little biased because Rachel McAdams is like my biggest girl crush ever). She is not portrayed as incredibly dumb (something other teen movies can't survive without) which when you think about it makes total sense: no dumb person could manipulate and intimidate their way trough high school so well. Of course the Plastics are shallow and the man crush is a popular hottie and the girl Cady first befriends happens to hate Regina more than anyone BECAUSE IT'S Still A HIGH SCHOOL MOVIE. You can't make a classic without throwing some of the stereotypes in there. Yet on the other hand the uniqueness of it is how it's the first of its kind to show how power and popularity can make you blind to other peoples feelings, and how bringing others down will not make your own insecurities vanish. Popularity should not be gained through intimidation, it should be earned by being NICE (a word that makes eyes roll and goosebumps appear in girl world). And if the horde can just realize the queen holds no actual power over them unless they give it to her she will need no taking down, she will fall herself. The best of its kind, a true classic that will never go out of fashion (even though we're talking about 2004 fashion), I would absolutely advice anyone who likes these kinds of movies to watch it right away, but then again, who hasn't already?",Mean Girls
235,survivorofakuze,Why It Disappoints,7,22 January 2014,"I'd heard that this was a really great movie, but for me it was something of a disappointment, although I've seen worse. I like Tina Fey, so I hate to hate on her baby, but she couldn't save the film for me, since there was that age gap anyway that put her on the edges of the film and not as one of the main protagonists, or rather the main protagonist. I'm not really familiar with Lindsey Lohan, apart from having heard the name, but her character seemed very politically correct, which made it seem forced to me. Just my two cents, as they say. But what really made me dislike the film was how they were people that you were ""allowed"" or had to sympathize with, and people that you just weren't supposed to like. It's very common in fiction for the popular girls to play the part of the fall guy and get demonized, and it gets very old after awhile. Also, I'd already seen Rachel McAdams in ""About Time"" (2013), so I like her, and I couldn't sympathize with her being made into the Enemy. Because, psychologically, it is almost like a war movie-- some people are the enemy; there is nothing good about them; they have no souls; you may not like them.... you're just not allowed to like them. I just didn't like how they divided everyone into rigid camps, which is at best a caricature, rather than a true or fair representation of what it's really like. And it's a little ironic, because then they use that to explain why everyone is so dumb and so stupid, etc., when it's really something of a straw-man that they're beating, in my opinion.Maybe people just watch too many war movies, so the need for an enemy in a film is too ingrained, I guess. At any rate I couldn't identify with Rachel McAdams being turned into that sort of an enemy, although it must have been easy early in her career when she wasn't known as well.... It's ironic that since Lohan was the better known, she got to be the ""normal"" girl, while the newer girl had to be the ""popular"" girl-- i.e., the fall guy. A little hypocritical. I suppose that I ought to give it an even lower score than I did, but I like to be conservative in taking away points-- I sorta grade on a negative scale, where they start at the top and I take points away-- and also I'm a guy and it's very much a girl film, so I don't want to be too hard on it for that reason.

I wasn't expecting much or anything at all, but I was dead wrong. This is actually one of the best movies I have seen this year.All good movies must start with at least solid acting.  This movie more than delivers with Lindsay Lohan giving a great performance as Cady Heron, a girl that has been homeschooled her entire life because her parents were scientists in Africa. Lohan does a great job appearing completely oblivious to almost all social situations and continues to act brilliantly as the movie continues and Cady completely alters her personality to fit in. The Plastics do a great job of acting as well and each one delivers very well on a different type of person that we have all had to deal with at some point in our lives.This is where the movie delivers best.  The movie gives all sorts of groups that almost everyone should be able to identify with.  Tina Fey does a great job writing a great script and playing the cynical teacher.Rating:  What's not to like about this movie???A+",Mean Girls

Since this was Lohan's first adult movie I'll give her props. She didn't do great, but she did not suck. I have never seen any girl go as far as the girls doin this movie, so I am not totally sure it's a ""documentary"" like movie. I would only see this if your a fan of any of the actress or actors, but if your looking for some deep meaning movie, save your money.

The acting was fantastic. Every character in the movie played a very convincing role. The movie was well written with a lot of funny moments. It was a movie that offered a look into the different levels of high-school's social pyramid instead of dwelling upon just one area. The cast from Saturday Night Live was very disciplined and well-balanced in this movie. Mean Girls had a well written plot, and left no doubt the actors were chosen perfectly for their roles. The Collector's Edition has a lot of out-takes, etc. The film moved along at such a steady pace it was easy to forget what happened earlier. Fortunately the DVD offers selections with commentaries from the producer, screen writer and director. This gives one a chance to recall some of of the things that did happen during the movie. As time moves forward, I think Mean Girls will stay up there with the most memorable of teen movies over the past decade.",Mean Girls
241,Nephalim,Falls Ideologically Flat,5,17 April 2005,"Minor Spoilers Ahead, watch out! This would've been a good movie if it had gone for utter farce and didn't try to so overtly deliver a moral, which ironically would've gotten the point across.Now I'm going to assume by the language and content that this movie was written for mid-teens. High-schoolers. However, the way it's delivered treats its audience like children that need to be walked from one idea to another. Instead of potentially coming to the conclusions the movie advocates ourselves, we're hand-held through some sloppy voiceovers from Cady Heron, the lead character played by Lindsay Lohan. The whole point of the movie is that these so-called ""plastics"" live pointless, hollow lives, thriving merely off the failures of others. This is extremely clear already, and doesn't need to be spelled out for us.While I'm on the subject of theme, I'd also like to address some of the hypocrisy this movie demonstrates. Going into it, one expects that this will attempt to demonize the clique nature of high school culture. Instead, it promotes it. All conflict in this movie comes from cliques clashing, and the happy resolution has the characters disassociate from each other into their own cliques. The only thing this film does is address problem cliques, like the ""skank army"" led by Rachel McAdams' Regina George, ensuring that with their destruction, the other cliques can live in peace. It's a wasted opportunity, if nothing else, that could've showcased just how ridiculous clique systems are.And then of course there's the blatant shallowness, disguised as marketing. The lead is the attractive (I think we can all agree) Lindsay Lohan, and while she's befriended by the average-looking Janis and Damien, they end up playing very minor roles. Instead, we're bombarded with beautiful people for the majority of the film. Beautiful Cady pursues hunky Aaron despite the machinations of pretty Regina. And even when Cady tricks Regina into gaining weight which makes her apparently lose her ""hot body,"" she still looks amazing. A couple of overweight students are thrown in so that Cady can, in the profound conclusion, assure us that you can still be beautiful without being a supermodel, but the film ignores these characters just as much as the Mean Girls it vilifies do.Why does Cady have to desire the typical teenage heart-throb over, say, the quirky but kind-hearted Damien? Why can't Janis be happily homosexual? Or at least ambiguous? Why does the film have to assure us, at the end, that she IS, in fact, straight? Why must every fat person persist to be a sponge for comedic abuse instead of an actual character? Why couldn't any of the pretty girls realize that being pretty doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) matter and stop putting so much effort into it? What seems to be an effort to break down preconceptions ends up reinforcing all the stereotypes we've seen before.If you don't want to look into it, it's entertaining enough. Many of the jokes are rather obvious, but it has its moments, particularly Rachel McAdams getting suddenly hit by a school bus during a heated confrontation with Lindsay Lohan. Watching it, I was thinking to myself, ""Man, arguing in the road? Someone better get hit by a bus,"" and lo and behold, BAM. I laughed extensively, and my vote would've been lower without it.",Mean Girls
242,robertrosado,Tina Fey deserves some major snaps.,10,1 January 2005,"High school is a scary place. Trust me, I know. I've been there. Getting through high school is like taking part in a collection of unpredictable games that test your stamina, self-esteem, and your patience. Okay, so maybe high school wasn't that bad. Based on the non-fiction book ""Queen Bees and Wannabes"" by Rosalind Wiseman, Tina Fey's terrific dark comedy, ""Mean Girls"", takes an honest, sassy, and hilarious look at the sneaky, backpack-wearing monsters who lurk the halls. Take cover.Cady Herron (Lindsay Lohan) has been home-schooled her whole life. Since her parents are zoologists, she was raised in Africa. In her home country, she noticed how the animals communicated, ate, and fought with each other. When her parents move back to the States, she feels that she is ready to take on the world of teenagers. If only she knew... Cady quickly becomes friends with goth chick, Janice Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and the flamboyantly gay, Damian (Daniel Franzese). Within a day or two, she finds herself in the clutches of The Plastics, a trio of beautiful and wealthy girls, led by the delicious Regina George (Rachel McAdams), the nosy Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert), and the ditsy Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). The Plastics are the most popular clique in school, even though everyone is afraid of them. As if she didn't have enough to do, Cady makes the mistake of falling for Regina's ex-boyfriend, Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett). Cady doesn't see the harm in this, but Regina is not going to stand for it. This means war, and the school is their battlefield.Directed with visual and comedic flair by Mark S. Waters (""The House of Yes""), Tina Fey's screenplay keeps the jokes coming fast and furious. The film is filled with biting satire, broken hearts, and sneaky sabotage folly. In one scene, Janice cuts up Regina's shirt, not realizing that she has inadvertently created a trend.Satire is a tricky genre, because the writer has to poke fun at different situations, while not exaggerating it to the point of parody. Fey succeeds with flying colors, as I'm sure a lot of people will relate to the wacky situations on screen. Her script is daffy, to be sure, but she keeps things authentic, and never lets the story digress into sap. For example... Throughout the film, Cady compares the interaction of students to that of wild apes. Also, in her attempt to get closer to Aaron, she purposely fails her math tests (even though she is really a whiz at math). Even the obligatory prom scene at the finale resembles an actual prom, as opposed to a flashy spectacle where all of the students perform a previously choreographed dance. Details like that succeed draw the audience further into the dangerous world that Fey is trying to create.After holding her own against Natasha Richardson & Dennis Quaid in ""The Parent Trap"", and Jamie Lee Curtis in ""Freaky Friday"", Lindsay Lohan delivers her best performance as Cady Herron. The transformation that Cady takes, from meek girl to devilish vixen, is quite remarkable. When she first arrives at school, Cady has no desire to be popular. All that she wants is to get through her day, unscathed. However, when she becomes the talk of the school, it does not occur to her that horrible things are headed her way. Lohan makes this startling transition real and organic. Rachel McAdams (""The Notebook"") is a standout as Regina George, a blonde ""biatch"" who is so good at hiding her true colors. You never know when she'll whip out her claws.Lacey Chabert (""Not Another Teen Movie"") and Amanda Seyfried (TV's 'All My Children') are adorable as Gretchen and Karen, respectively. Unlike Regina, neither Karen nor Gretchen are mean. They hang out with her simply because it makes them feel like they're part of a special group. Lizzy Caplan (TV's 'The Pitts') and Daniel Franzese (""Bully"") steal their scenes as Janice and Damien, while never turning them into stereotype. Jon Bennett (""Season of Youth"") avoids playing Aaron as a cliché boyfriend character. Instead, he makes Aaron a really likable guy who, as fate would have it, is caught between Cady and Regina. The adult cast, made up of first-class comedians, is just as strong. Amy Poehler, Tim Meadows, Ana Gasteyer, Neil Flynn, and especially Tina Fey, give it their all, and add their unique quirks to the proceedings.""Mean Girls"" is a simply divine treat for anyone who has ever gone to high school, meaning that almost everyone will enjoy it. It easily joins ""Clueless"", ""10 Things I Hate About You"", ""American Pie"", ""Saved!"", ""The Girl Next Door"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and the Brat Pack flicks as one of the best teen movies. The bitchy dialogue, vicious direction, and developed characters elevate it into a class above the rest. It's one of the finest films of the year. The bottom line: It's so fetch.",Mean Girls

She ended up making friends, especially Regina and her mean bitches. But when she went along with her other friends' plan to get revenge on Regina, that's when strange things started happening to Cady, especially after she got a makeover from Regina and her friends. She started dumbing down her schoolwork so she could be with Aaron Samuels, she started worrying about stuff that didn't really mater like whether or not Aaron wants to be my boyfriend. He ain't thinking about her. Plus, she started lying to her friends, including Regina and her gang. My math teacher's failing me on purpose because I didn't join the matheletes. Cady, stop lying. You are failing that class for all the wrong reasons, pathetic. You are doing everything for the wrong reasons. Plus, the scene when she admitted to Aaron that she pretended to be bad at math so he could tutor her, the fact that she was good at math, and that she was flunking on purpose, that's when all hell broke loose. Isn't that funny? That's nothing to laugh about. Ignorance is nothing to be proud of. Then she's telling him to shut up. You know what? Shut up, Cady. You sounded real brainless and ignorant with what you admitted to Aaron. You're focused on the wrong thing and you are acting like something you're not. My mother was right. When you pretend to be something you're not, you start to look real foolish. Does she look like a pathetic fool? Oh yeah. Plus, Aaron really liked you and your other 2 friends socialized with you because they thought you were an individual. Now, you're more like pathetic. Well, I'm glad she decided to stand up and take personal responsibility for what she did later on. Plus, once she helped win the mathathelon, she apologized to everybody. This is what happens when you do something bad. It comes back to bite you in the ass. Once it backfires, it will hurt real bad. Imagine how Regina felt after she realized Cady used her.

You can sympathize with her and even when shes a real bitch she has some charm.Rachel McAdams was perfectly cast as the Queen Bee, and was able to deliver an enchanting performance even when being an evil little byotch. I'm glad to see Lacey Chabert is still getting recognition and Amanda Seyfried was adorable as super-ditzy Karen This film is a must have for all girls and despite having quite a serious message sometimes it still manages to funny sometimes and remain light hearted. A few flaws would be that whoever played Janis was slightly annoying and Damian wasn't nearly gay enough but all in all I love this film. 8/20",Mean Girls
247,elizy-33092,One of the best teen flicks of all time,10,23 April 2017,"I feel as though any comedy written by Tina Fey is gonna be perfect. Thetiming of the humor is flawless, the moral is heartwarming, and the characters are to die for. Even those whom aren't into ""chick flicks"" like these will probably have a marvelous time watching this, whether male or female, and whether young or old. I've heard guys admittedly ogle over this film. I mean, even my grandpa thought it was hilarious, which says a lot considering he is more of the serious type who rarely laughs at what most would consider funny. Therefore meaning, if my grandpa can enjoy it, then it's highly likely that anyone else could as well.",Mean Girls
248,dicksosa,Why you should see the movie,7,8 May 2004,"Although this movie is no Heathers in its cruelness it still has comical wit and crass jokes.  The movie basically takes a girl who has never been to public school until she was 16, as she's been in Africa with her parents, and throws her into to her Junior year of high school.  Now that in itself is a decent plot that can either lead to a movie full of wisely placed cracks or a horrible flop.  This film is much more the former. 
The cast of actresses does a decent enough job, and they do have enough timing to deliver punchlines with an effective manner.  One of the best parts however is Tim Meadows of Saturday Night Live, who is the principal of the high school.  His dry style blends well into the movie to provide a great relief from the cliche jokes that can inhabit a film like this. 
Another great aspect is the subtle political jokes thrown in this movie, knocking how kids in our society are raised by MTV and it's idea of what is cool.  The jabs aren't a main part of the movie but I found extremely funny.The movie has the trite ending as you would expect of a film like this, however there is enough unexpected parts of the film that it doesn't really subtract from the film as an enjoyable experience.  So even though the film seems like it would be a pile of steaming dog mess, it isn't.  It's a well blended strawberry margarita on a lazy Sunday afternoon at the beach. Definitely worth a watch.",Mean Girls

In the end my curiosity got the better of me. I am really, really glad that it did. This movie was full of silly stunts and well written verbal attacks. No one was safe, it seemed, from being fully attacked as far as cliques are concerned. The actors were great, the script was even better, and I spent most of the time laughing my head off. I guess most of the jokes came out of nowhere and sort of shocked me into giggle fits. Tina Fey has always been good at what she does, and this is no exception. This film is good for belly laughs and light-hearted fun. I say see it! :)",Mean Girls

251,andyrichterismissing,Math Enthusiast/Bad-Ass MC,7,21 April 2004,"While the trailers for this certainly give you the disturbing feeling that it's going to be god-awful, it rose above that early bad impression and was actually pretty solid. It's not exactly the greatest movie ever made, and has two or three lulls, but for the most part it moves quickly and is quite funny, sometimes even hilarious. And perhaps best of all, it brings back Tim Meadows, who's sharper and funnier in this than anything he's been in for a long time. The girls are all solid as well, especially Lindsay Lohan, who hopefully will continue to do more interesting work like this, and less bland Disney comedies-she proves here that she can do more than that. Finally, there's a refreshing dark edge to the material that most movies of this sort hint at but tend to avoid. It's not done in a one-note mean-spirited way, but it definitely has an edge to it. The last joke of the movie is priceless. Tina Fey rules!",Mean Girls
252,kaspen12,"A smart, but flawed, look at high school life",7,10 February 2006,"There are a few signs heading into Mean Girls that it will be an above-average teen comedy. First of all, it's written by Tina Fey and produced by Lorne Michaels. Secondly, there's so much hotness on display, that even if you're not entertained, there's still lots to look at. Not that it isn't entertaining. It is. Lindsay Lohan is Cady, daughter of a pair of zoologists (SNL's Ana Gasteyer and Neil Flynn, best known as the janitor from TV's Scrubs), who has spent much of her life living with her parents in the middle of the African bush. When the family decides to move back to the city, Cady is faced with an environment more dangerous than any she faced in Africa: high school.On her first day, Cady falls in with pair of artists (one of whom is ""too gay to function"") who show her the ropes early on. They act as our guide as well, giving us a tour of what the film's idea of high school is. While its aim is largely satire, ironically, most of its ideas on cliquedom ring true. Sitting atop the social pyramid are The Plastics, led by evil incarnate Regina George (Rachel McAdams), and when The Plastics take an interest in Cady, she goes along with it as an experiment -- infiltration of the upper echelon. Immersed in the Plastic lifestyle, Cady begins to become one herself, much to the chagrin of her old friends. She too can recognize she's becoming vain and vapid, but feels powerless to stop it, or maybe she just doesn't care enough. Things go sour when Cady falls for Regina's ex, Aaron Samuels. ""Don't you know exes are off limits,"" asks a Plastic. ""It's like, the first rule of feminism."" Regina gets back with Aaron for no other reason than a desire to mess with Cady's emotions, and from there, it's war.Fey's script is pretty good, but it's not flawless. There are many quotable lines to be found (the best of which come from the adult cast, made up of SNLers Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler, on top of Gasteyer and Fey herself). What starts out as scathing satire, however, ends up becoming what it targets. Everything winds up the way it should be; the story ties itself up in with a neat little bow; no hurt feelings are left unresolved. In other words, the exact opposite of high school.OVERALL SCORE: 7.1/10 = C+Mean Girls is likable enough to recommend. It's funny, very quotable, and stands up to repeat viewings. It's just not all it could have been, and by that, I mean it's not Heathers.",Mean Girls
253,squodge,Ordinary film with extraordinary performances and dialogue - GO SEE IT!,9,20 October 2004,"I watched this film on a flight back from Japan and it was possibly the best film I'd seen in the last twelve months, which is saying something because I've seen about 300 films since January this year.Basically, I was expecting your average teen flick, but I discovered that this film has a lot more going for it. The usual gags are there, as well as the usual stereotypes. But stereotypes can be exploited in a positive way - in Mean Girls, the stereotypes were there to help us identify with the characters very quickly so less time is spent on character development.The scene in the gym where the teachers ask each kid to atone for their sins (after the 'book' is found) is classic. It was hilarious watching the kids say nasty things and then apologise for them.After seeing the awful Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, I was expecting the worse from this film.

Cady tries to make it in public school after being home schooled.Mean Girls is a great movie because it is packed with excitement! This movie has everything to offer. The comedy is hilarious. The different sayings like ""So fetch"", for example, will have you laughing for the rest of your life. The dance contest will have boys at the edge of their seats. The costume party will make you scream because Cady comes to the party with a different type of costume than everyone else.There is action in this movie, but it is different from the action you see in other movies. The action is filled with fighting between girls, people getting hit by buses, and a lot of lying that starts up trouble. The suspense in Mean Girls has you thinking from the beginning to the end. Romance is also in this movie; some good and some bad.Everyone in the family will enjoy this movie, especially teenagers.",Mean Girls

Lindsay is adoreable and I cant wait to see more of her movies.

The story itself is about a girl who has been home schooled for the better part of her life who is suddenly cast into the high school experience and the culture shock she endures.

260,so_original,Familiar territory for many.,8,14 March 2008,"""Mean Girls"" has often been described as ""Clueless"" meets ""Heathers"". But I think each film stands out as classic teen flicks of their era [ Heathers for the 80's, Clueless for the 90's, and Mean Girls for the new millennium teens]. Heathers was very dark and sarcastic, while Clueless is light hearted and frivolous. Mean Girls is somewhere in between and very much set in reality. The backstabbing, rumor-starting, clique-driven reality of high school, especially when young women are involved. This is what makes the film so funny and so popular.Lindsay Lohan stars as Cady Heron, a high school junior who transfers from Africa. Having been homeschooled all her life, she knows nothing about what she's getting into. She is at first guided through high school by Janis and Damien, who are both sort of outcasts. She is then introduced to the Plastics, the most popular girls in school. Regina George [ Rachael McAdams ] is the leader of the clique, with her followers Gretchen Weiners [ Lacey Chabert ] and Karen Smith [ Amanda Seyfried ]. Janis convinces Cady to get into the clique to bring Regina down, since Janis has a vendetta against her after she spread a nasty rumor about her. Cady does, also angry at Regina for hooking up with her crush Aaron Samuels, but soon becomes one of the Plastics, inside and out.Lohan does a great job, showing the transformation of Cady from a sweet-natured, naive girl to one of the mean girls herself. Rachel McAdams does often manage to steal the show. She is, as Regina, the girl a lot of people knew in high school. Beautiful, and seemingly friendly on the outside, but who's really a backstabber at heart. McAdams manages to give her depth, though, as she makes Regina the girl you love to hate or hate to love. The supporting players are also great, including Lacey Chabert as Gretchen, the girl who doesn't really have her own mind because she's afraid of not going along with the crowd.The writing is also just as excellent as the acting. It is written by SNL writer and comedian Tina Fey, who plays Cady's math teacher. It is really sharp and witty. The clichés of high school are often played up with metaphors and creative ways, like there being a map of the cafeteria table cliques and the Plastics treated and talked about like celebrities. There are also great lines and scenes that really show what it's like to be in high school.I really think this is a solid, funny movie. I would recommend to this just about everyone, because I'm sure many people will be able to relate or be entertained by this film, since everyone has to go through high school. It seems to be aimed more at young women, especially if they are still in or just out of high school.",Mean Girls
261,wee_scottish_lassie,Brilliant!!,8,1 January 2005,"Anyone who thinks this is just one of those boring chick flicks with a boring and pointless plot, are you sure you've got the right film? I don't think that anyone in their right mind could say that this is a bad film. It might not appeal to some of the male population but apart from them, it is the kind of film that anyone would have to admit is funny. I have never been to an American school so I don't know whether the stereotypes used were 100% realistic but I found that some of the situations and groups of people were easy to relate to and they are not falsely criticized. The idea of having ""the plastics"" is really good and the fact that they think that everyone likes them and that everyone wants to be like them but the fact is that they are the most hated people in the school is pretty realistic.It was a fun film to watch.

262,senorjuez,"Reminisent of ""Heathers""",7,3 December 2005,"I saw the film ""Mean Girls"" on cable recently, and in some ways it reminded me of the late-80's classic ""Heathers"". Each of the girls in the Plastics clique in this film reminded me of the girls in the clique in that film. Regina, the leader reminded me of the conceited, power bitch Heather who bought the farm after drinking drain cleaner(or whatever it was)and crashing through a glass tabletop. Gretchen, reminded me of the Heather played by Shannon Doherty, pretending to like the clique leader, but waiting for the chance to take over. Karen, the dumb Plastic, reminded me of cheerleader Heather, neutral and unassuming. Lindsay Lohan's character, Cady, reminded me of the Winona Ryder character in ""Heathers"", the only one not named Heather. Both were not happy being in the clique, and wanted to have normal lives, but were sucked in by what being in the clique had to offer. Popularity. That is pretty much the only goal in high school. Both films illustrate this point strongly. Only the times have changed.",Mean Girls

I loved her in the Parent Trap & should have know this & Freaky Friday would be good if for no other reason than her.  Check this movie out.  It is hilarious & it will take you back to your days in high school.  It shows high school life in a realistic way, while still getting it's point across.

The characterisations are far better than in most films of this type (people, including the mean girls, aren't stereotypes).

There were ups, downs, comedy and drama rolled nicely together and presented in a nice un-uberly predictable way.

Lindsay Lohan is great and her love for Jonathan Bennett's character is totally believable. She has finally been able to play a dramatic character and completely leave out any hints of her outrageous comic characters. For her, I believe this is a spectacular performance. Tina Fey came up with a very original and intellectual script based on the inner workings of the social milieu. The loops and circles of the story are wonderfully constructed and laid out in such a way to allow a very mysterious plot, and yet is not completely confusing.We see that relationships are made up of many ups and downs, likes and dislikes that love is not perfect, but it does not have to be",Mean Girls

270,GoodfellaSeinfeld,"Sit down, turn your brain off, and enjoy it",6,25 November 2012,"Mean Girls was (and still is) a phenomenon with girls 13-18. In High School, the movie was simply the most quoted movie with the girls at my school. Yes, Mean Girls was a huge hit when it was released and continues to be a cult classic to this day. I was at the mall a few days ago and heard a group of girls quoting it and wondered if the movie still hold up to all the way back when I saw it on the big screen with a date. I got home, turned it on, and decided to push the phenomenon, the current state of Lindsy Lohan, and the fact that most of these people have never worked again, aside and watch it as a movie.The story is an interesting tale and twist on the ""new kid moving to town"" story. Cady Heron, played by Lindsy Lohan, is a hit with The Plastics, the A-list girl clique at her new school, until she makes the mistake of falling for Aaron Samuels, played by Jonathan Bennett, the ex-boyfriend of alpha Plastic Regina George, played by Rachel McAdams. Throughout the movie there are constant references to the assassination of Ceaser, which is interesting because the movie somewhat retells this story in a modernly (I don't want to give anything away). Anyway, the story is by far the best part of Mean Girls. The movie more builds the story around the characters, making them fit and stay relevant in the world around them, that is hard for a movie about high school. I really like this story and I would like to see it done again in other movies.Mean Girls has a lot of good things in it. Rachel McAdams is a great character. You just hate her even more and more as the movie goes on, like Cady. Mean Girls also has a great set of side characters. The movie is made by the characters as I said, the movie isn't based on action. Ms. Norbury, Mr. Duvall, Mrs. George, Jason, and Kevin are just a few great characters in the movie. I also, think the movie is very well written. There are a few jokes that fall flat, sure but most jokes are well written and offer quite a few laughs. Lastly, I just want to mention the character Damian. He actually delivers more laughs then any other character in the movie so I had to separate him into a different category. That being said, the movie does have a few flaws. The movie did not have a great pay off to what happens to Regina. You see what happens, but it isn't very realistic or funny. I also had problems with the ending overall for the same endings. I hate to say it, but the ending brings down the movie by about a whole star. I did not like the idea of the Burn Book. The payoff, again isn't funny or heartfelt or even interesting. I also felt the movie got very predictable by the end. I remember sitting in the theater and being able to tell where the movie was going to go at about the halfway point. Overall, Mean Girls has surprisingly stood the test of time after all. I may not enjoy it as much as I did back in 2004, but I still think it is a very good comedy. Mean Girls is a very fun and enjoyable comedy and I recommend you see it, even if you are not a fan of Chick Flicks of Lindsy Lohan.",Mean Girls
271,English-Class2014,Became one of my favourite films the first time I saw it.,9,3 May 2014,"""Mean Girls"" has become one of my favourite films the first time I saw it. It's an American teen comedy film from 2004, which includes a lot of drama but also comedy. First we're getting introduced to a normal teenage girl named Cady Heron played by actress Lindsey Lohan, who sets foot on the grounds of North Shore High School in a small town outside of Chicago, Illinois. At this school she comes upon a lot of different groups that first don't acknowledge her, but she quickly wins two friends, who clear up the mystery of groups - especially the most famous one named ""The Plastics"". ""The Plastics"" consist of three girls: Regina George, Gretchen Wienerd and Karen Smith played by Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chambert and Amanda Seyfried. The leader of this group, Regina, is one of the meanest and shallowest known girls at this school, who enjoys making people's life a living hell, including Cady's new friends. These two don't want to put up with the situation anymore and beg Cady to help them to avenge Regina, which leads to a lot of trouble, ""catfight"", but also fun. The movie was directed by Mark Waters and the screenplay was written by Tina Fey. It is based in part on the non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman. The film was produced by Saturday Night Live (SNL). The film's orchestral score was written by Rolfe Kent and orchestrated by Tony Blondal. It featured taiko drums and a full orchestra. In my opinion it's worth it to watch the movie especially at sleepovers with your friends, because it has a lot of drama, but also fun in it.Theresa S. and Miriam N.",Mean Girls
272,annalealyon-1,-*Mean Girls*- My opinion and thoughts of the movie. Positive outlook.,8,5 April 2007,"First of all, this movie just really showed how school is for teenagers now. Some people might think that the language and everything was bad but unfortunately, that's exactly how school is now. Mean Girls shows everything that could possibly happen in your junior high/high school experience. It's mainly showing how a nice girl can get taken on the ride of her life and be turned into a mean girl. Also, it shows this vicious clique rise and fall. The Mean Girls: Karen: In my opinion, she wasn't completely mean, but she was referred to as a *slut* and she was best friends with the mean ones, so she was the least mean of the clique. She was also the dumb one so she had a niceness about her. Gretchen: Gretchen was a meaner girl. She was a queen bee wannabe. She wanted to hard for Regina to think the world of her. Even though she was probably richer than Regina, she didn't have the high queen bee status. Regina: The meanest of all means. She could get any guy she wanted, most people could hate her and still want her to like them. She started off with power. Money, friends, guys, she had it all. She controlled everything around her. Cady: An innocent girl from Africa, experiencing school life for the first time. She gets sucked into the ""girl world"" instantly. She slowly turns into the Mean Girl.This movie shows how girls can be meaner than anything you can possibly imagine. Cliques, labels, all of it is shown here. For an interesting view of the high school/Jr high experience, this is the movie. It portrays everything you can possibly imagine. I would strongly recommend seeing this movie, because it has a great truth about it.",Mean Girls
273,PhillipSimons,Amusing,6,3 April 2006,"Well I must say that this movie is a positive surprise! It's really something fresh, a comedy with a certain theme, made with much taste. The characters, especially Linsday Lohan/Cady Heron transform progressively from one extremity to another without disturbing the inner balance of the movie.The story is quite simple - a new girl, Cady Heron (Lohan), lived with here parents in Africa and had ""home education"". She returns with them in her teenage years to the States, and for the very first time she is confronted with a new problem - High school! At first she is confused and disoriented, and as time goes by she gets between two cliques. On one side, the smart, weired and mysterious Janis and Damian, and on the other side ""The Plastics"", a elite girl trio leaded by Regina George (McAdams). This movie also manages to demonstrate the behavior of teenagers, often lost and in search for their true identity. So basically both main characters - Cady as well as Regina pass through a complete persona transformation.Also there are some very humorous or memorable scenes. Just see the ""Winter talent/Jingle Bells Rock"" scene. A better music score is just missing.Linsday Lohan and Rachel McAdams make both a great performance and actually carry this movie throughout the story. So the acting plus the original, refreshing, unpredictable and clever story together result a delightful movie. Maybe with just one more star actor in a supporting role (parents, teacher's,..) the movie would have been even better. But than again...",Mean Girls

This film depicts the vicious pecking order of the average American High School.Good cast, good to see Lindsay Lohan looking healthy before she turned anorexic. Surprisingly she can act, but that talent is going to waste with her excessively unhealthy lifestyle.Racheal McAdams is just delightfully bitchy as Regina George; she does what every bitch does best: sugar coats her mean intentions with cutesy smiles, a batter of her eyelashes and a sugary sweet voice that dominates and manipulates everything and everyone until they are submissive and miserable.Twists and turns in this film keep it fresh, which is something of a challenge for many teen films. Many are just corny and stupid. This film does have a little sentimental moment at the end, but the upbeat comedy of the film keeps things on track.This film has a lot of stereotypes in it; we can all see a bit of our popular school peers in the plastics. The whole stereotyping makes the film funny, and it gives edge.I really wish there were more teen films like this, so far the only teen movies that I have really loved were Clueless and this one.This film is edgy, stylish and oh so fetch.

276,TypedbyTara,On Wednesdays We Wear Pink,8,15 March 2012,"I'm not kidding when I say Mean Girls may be one of the best teen movies out there. This movie is so freakin' hilarious and there are a number of reasons why people can't get enough! 1st: The Quotes. Spend a week in any high school and I GUARANTEE that you will hear this movie being quoted. Not only are the quotes recognizable, but they are so damn funny. ""On Wednesdays we wear Pink"", ""Your mom's chest hair!!"" and ""So Fetch"" are crowd favorites. Not to mention that it's every teenage girl's goal to memorize the infamous rap by Kevin G.2nd: The Characters. This movie shows Lindsey Lohan at her best! She actually manages to portray the innocence of ""the new girl"" very well. Even though there were no Oscar winning performances, I thought the cast did a wonderful job of portraying the sincerity of their roles. The characters themselves are very memorable, from the dumb Karen, to the ""gay"" Damien, we loved them all!3rd and Finally: The relatability. Every teen can relate to this flick, after all, it is about high school. It's funny and interesting, this movie has stuff we want to watch like awkward moments, backstabbing, partying, devious plans and hilarious situations!",Mean Girls
277,Mouldyman,"Not brilliant, but entertaining on a rainy day",5,12 July 2004,"This film was great in places, there were some genuinely very funny moments scattered through it. Unfortunately these were not frequent enough to hold my attention, and stop the film from dragging considerably.Lindsay performs well in a role which basically requires her to look good and look apologetic, but her co-stars playing her best friends give very lackluster and one dimensional performances. In fact all the characters in the film are fairly one sided and lack real depth. A lot of their motivations are left unclear, and I got the feeling a lot had been cut from this film which perhaps would have explained theseBut I suppose this film was not aimed at me, and my little sister enjoyed it, although I was shocked on her behalf at some of the content. After seeing what these 16 yr olds got up to, I think I went to school in the wrong country!",Mean Girls

Pretty girls, ugly one, you have teams like African one, Asiatic one, Jocks, fat one, skinny one and especially Plastics .(THE best girls) ""Beware Plastics!"" The story is simple but funny, a teenage girl from Africa (Lohan) arrives in a high school and discovers a lot of new students. At the beginning she doesn't know how to do but she finally meets the plastics and little by little become one of them...The director is the Freaky Friday's one, so if you liked this movie, run to see this one!

This movie is another of those typical high school stories where the not so popular kids try to teach the popular kids a lesson and bring them down a notch or two. This results in endless pranks and backstabbing. There's also a touch of romance, with the main character Cady having her first real crush and doing everything she can to win his heart back from the mean girls. Definitely a story anyone in their teens/20s can relate to.There's some very clichéd scenes and jokes, but also some VERY funny parts. The storyline has similarities to ""Never Been Kissed"" (with Drew Barrymore.) If you like movies such as ""Can't Hardly Wait"" and ""Jawbreaker"" then I reckon you'll LOVE Mean Girls!",Mean Girls

I came out of the theater on my toes because I was so pleasantly surprised with the end result.""Mean Girls"" is the story of the new girl at a high school, Cady Heron (Lohan), who becomes friends with the wrong crowd, called the ""Plastics."" The only thing is that she's not a bad girl; she's smart and nice. When she starts turning into one of ""them"" and becomes the ""Queen Bee,"" everything goes haywire in the school.The talented and sharply funny Tina Fey of Saturday Night Live fame wrote this stinging high school satire. Her writing shines and translates better than one could have imagined. Fey admits to having a ""Mean Girl"" high school life, so she writes from experience.This is the best SNL film that's been made yet because it doesn't come from an SNL skit. ""The Ladies Man"" and ""A Night at the Roxbury"" were lame attempts at humor. ""Mean Girls"" transcends above standard SNL shlock and gives hope to all those SNL losers out there like Tim Meadows. Meadows is at his best as the principal of the high school. He feels out of place in the atmosphere, but that makes it more funny.All in all, the movie is hysterical and every high school student with a sense of humor should see it. It bites hard, it makes you laugh and even your parents will enjoy it as long as they aren't too strict about language and crass humor.---8/10",Mean Girls
286,willc1991,Mean Girls is surprisingly outstanding.,7,5 January 2005,"In my opinion, writer/director Tina Fey has a great movie. This is by far the best teen movie I've ever seen. Lindsay Lohan does a good job taking on Cady's role, and all the supporting cast does great too, well maybe some. Mean Girls isn't recognized by most people as wonderful, but most critics skip the teen movies anyway. After watching it you can watch it over and over. There are parts of the movie that makes you wanna burst out with laughter. This movie even appealed to me, I was actually forced to see it by my girlfriend and she just had to have me come with her.

It follows the story of Cady who arrives in America for high school after spending her formative years being home schooled while travelling through Africa with her parents. And this is where the fun begins..The school Cady attends look like something typical to a teen comedy from the plastics' (the beautiful popular people) to the nerds and outcasts, and Cady sets out to learn about the rules of surviving high school. But this is no  everyone learns a good morale lesson, nice teen movie', the comedy is bitingly satirical and even when it seems to have a sweet ending it is very much tongue in cheek. I personally found the intelligence of the humour greatly rewarding in comparison to most movies of this genre, and I wish black comedies like this would come around more often.",Mean Girls
288,katie-joy,A well deserved ten stars!,10,5 November 2005,"Lindsay Lohan (Cady Heron) and Rachel McAdams (Regina George) were the best ones for these roles.

But one thing is different: She's from Africa and never actually been to a ""real"" school before since she's been homeschooled. Cady thinks she knows how to survive the evil ""girl world."" But quickly falls apart when she meets The Plastics, Regina (McAdams) and her two ""little workers"" Karen Smith and Gretchen Wieners.Cady's friends Damian and Janis Ian think it would be funny if Cady pretended to be Regina's friend and ruin her life.

290,emuhlee15,Lindsay Lohan's best movie.,7,6 January 2009,"Lindsay Lohan has been in some real stinkers, most notably ""I Know Who Killed Me."" However, ""Mean Girls"" is surprisingly refreshing, original, and entertaining. The mixture of Tina Fey's killer screenplay and great acting talent by the cast makes this a rather memorable picture.Comparing this to ""Heathers"" is like comparing apples and oranges, I think. ""Heathers"" is much, much, much, much, much darker and satirical than ""Mean Girls"". ""Mean Girls"" is more of a real snapshot of what high school life can be like. True, the characters are mostly stereotypical and one-dimensional, but the message of the movie - the importance of friendship - shines through these insanely confined stereotypes.",Mean Girls

292,dedebee,Being bad has never been so good....,9,24 January 2005,"The teen-movie genre returns with ""Mean Girls,"" and it comes back with a vengeance. What could have been a tired and clichéd retread of ""Heathers"" is actually a clever and witty flick thanks to the talents of screenwriter Tina Fey. Fey, head writer for ""Saturday Night Live"" and co-anchor of their ""Weekend Update,"" has an amazing flair for satire, and what better way to showcase it than with a analytical glimpse at the world of high school cliques? Lindsay Lohan is Cady, the previously home-schooled daughter of two zoologists, growing up in the African wilderness while Mom and Dad conduct their research. When the 'rents decide to settle down, Cady gets her first taste of public schooling, which is almost as wild as the jungles and safaris she's used to. Cady is introduced to the different factions that populate the cafeteriaincluding the nympho band geeks, the nerdy Asians, the cool Asians, the varsity jocks and of course, the Plastics, teen royalty led by the manipulative Regina George (Rachel McAdams).Cady is encouraged to infiltrate the Plastics by her new friends Janice (Lizzy Caplan), a gothy and arty outcast who possesses a Janaene Garafalo-style wit, and the flamboyantly out-and-proud Damian (Daniel Franzese), who fears the Plastics but admires their fabulousness. Cady agrees to the sabotage scheme, but it's not long before she succumbs to the glamorous life of the Plastics and starts to engage in their underhanded activities, such as writing in their ""Burn Book,"" in which nasty (and hilarious) things are jotted down about every girl in their high school.It all might sound like the typical teen fare, but the result is nothing like that. The cast is surprisingly flawless, from Lohan (who brings a depth to her role that Hilary Duff could only ever dream of achieving) to the entire supporting cast, which is filled with current ""SNL"" members and alums. Fey herself shows up along with Tim Meadows as sardonic members of the high school faculty, while Ana Gasteyer and Amy Poehler portray parents who just don't understand. Poehler steals every scene she's in as Regina's ""cool mom,"" desperately trying to fit in by doing things like offering minors alcohol at her home, because she'd rather have them drinking there than somewhere else.The younger members of the cast don't let the veterans walk away with the whole show though. Caplan and Franzese own their roles, Franzese particularly when Damian displays his adulation for Christina Aguilera during a holiday talent show. The other members of the Plastics shine as well. Besides the deliciously vindictive McAdams as the Queen Bee, the crew includes former ""Party of Five"" actress Lacey Chabert as the gossipy Gretchen and Amanda Seyfried as the clueless Karen, who's not above making out with her first cousin (because ""there's cousins, and then there's first cousins and second cousins"").Fey, with the help of director Mark Waters (""Freaky Friday,"" ""The House of Yes""), has infused the film with her trademark comedic brilliance. The jokes and gags come at a break-neck pace, but the punch lines aren't the only hilarious aspects. Little touches such as Gretchen's dad being the inventor of Toaster Strudels and Regina's MTV obsessed little sister are details that will inspire laughter long after the movie is over. Even the particulars about the background characters should provide endless chuckles (just try to think about Trang Pak, the girl in wheelchair and her little person-sidekick, and the Middle-Eastern, hip-hop-obsessed mathlete/""Bad-Ass MC"" after the movie without smiling).If there's anything to complain about in this film, it's the overt sexualization of teenage girls. Of course, the actresses are older than they play, with the exception of Lohan (who, at 17 years old, brings an R. Kelly-like meaning to ""The Parent Trap""). Parents might see the Disney-friendly actress in the trailers and bring their young children, but this movie is not for those under high school age (girls are called ""sluts"" and ""whores"" throughout). However, that doesn't mean anyone who's older than the class of 2004 shouldn't check ""Mean Girls"" out. Fey, Waters, and the entire cast have made sure the experience will be enjoyable for everyone.",Mean Girls
293,chocokitty11,The best teen movie of the new millennium,9,15 May 2011,"Mean Girls has everything a great teen movie should have. It has a fantastic script with lines that people are stilling quoting, 7 years later. The characters are funny, relateable, and have depth. You can find something you like about the protagonists, and something you don't like about the antagonists. The plot is unpredictable and interesting. What more from a teen movie could you want? I think a lot of people who gave this movie a low rating are missing the point. This movie is not supposed to be taken completely seriously. Its exaggerated on purpose to be funny. It's not telling your teenage daughter to go out and act like a bitch. If you think that, then you obviously completely missed the message. In conclusion, if you are looking for a light squeaky clean teen comedy, Mean Girls is not for you. If you want something hilarious with great dialog and essences of classics like Heathers, go out and rent this movie.",Mean Girls
294,gnosis1,Very well done. Thanks to the SNL cast.,9,5 May 2004,"I am almost ashamed to say I have a soft spot for teen/romantic comedies. And although I am nowhere near the target audience for this film I thought it was great.   I have been saddened lately by the utter dreck coming from SNL writers, they have turned a show I used to love into one I barely tolerate.  The beauty of this film is that it captures the SNL humor I so enjoy and does not get itself caught up in all the inherent problems that usually plague movies based on short SNL skits.  For the most part the principle adult characters are former or current SNL alumns and they manage to give decent performances.  Lindsay Lohan does a great job as well as most of the cast.  Unfortunately for this film the target audience(11-14 year girls most likely) will not get most of the jokes in this movie.  I spent most of my time laughing thankfully, but the only times the theater erupted with laughter were the 2 or 3 times that they played obvious gag jokes and one liners, which wasnt often.  The comedy in this movie(like one prank in the movie where one of the characters tells a girls mom she is calling from planned parenthood) fell mostly on deaf ears as the audience was too young to understand.  All in all I give this movie an 8.5. Well shot, well paced and packed with classic SNL comedy. Very well written and directed and hopefully will result in more quality movies stemming from(though not necessarily being of) the SNL universe.",Mean Girls

All goes well until She falls for Regina George'(Rachel Mcadams) ex-boyfriend.Mean Girls was a very funny movie and it is the best teen flick of the 21st so far!

296,ncfan,"A smart, clever, and very funny teen movie",8,29 June 2004,"Mean GirlsCady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), has been living in Africa with her parents for a few years, where she has always been home schooled. But once her family moved back to America, Cady is enrolled in a public high school. Here is an environment which Cady is not familiar with.Along the way, she meets up with two other people who be-friend her. Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian (Daniel Franzese) tell her what to expect from 'certain' people. Cady is handed the layout to where everyone sits at lunch. She is also warned about the 'plastics'. But before the day is through, Cady meets up with the girls: Regina George (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabet), and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). They let her in their small group, and give her the 411 on the rules.Of cause there is soon tension between Cady and Regina, when Cady begins to have a crush on Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett). Cady soon finds out from Gretchen that Aaron and Regina used to be a couple for a year before they broke up. Once Regina finds out that Cady likes Aaron, she decides to talk to Aaron for Cady. But things begin to get catty, when Regina makes a move on Aaron. This leads to an all out war between Cady and Regina.My opinion...This is a movie leaning towards the teen audience. But this movie stands out from the rest. It is smart, clever, and very funny. Lindsay did a great job, something very different from her previous roles in Disney movies. She was very confident, and was well-suited in the role of Cady. She showed that she can innocent one minute, but when something really annoys her she can come back with the goods. The only movie which I have seen Rachel McAdams in is The Hot Chick, and thought that she was pretty funny in that one. She began to get on my nerves in the movie. I think that if I met her character in real life, I would try to avoid her, as she would be someone who would manipulate you a lot. Lacey Chabert seemed to portray her character, Gretchen, as someone who wouldn't speak up when Regina was around, but eventually saw Regina's nasty side when Cady was teaching Regina a lesson.8/10",Mean Girls

The film follows the life of Lohan as she starts high school, she gets involved with a group of girls called the plastics. these are the top class girls in the school, Lohan decides she will give them a chance as she doesn't have any friends. things are fun for a while, but then they all turn for the worst!! it is a great movie and it will cheer ya up and make ya laugh at the madness of American high schools. 8* out of 10",Mean Girls

I like this movie because of it's realistic qualities and it's also really funny! (It also has Lindsay Lohan in it when she had better hair!)

301,moviereviewer6700,Fabulous and Funny at the same time - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!,8,3 May 2020,"If your looking for a movie that you could potentially class as a real guilty pleasure then you might not have to look much further. As someone who doesn't usually watch these types of movies I absolutely loved it and for such a film to get such a stellar cast with names like Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, Rachel McAdams & Tina Fey. I was pleasantly surprised at how much on screen chemistry there was and it all seemed to just fall into place.Lohan's character Cady is incredibly likeable from the start. A girl who has moved to a new school learning about cliques and the social hierachy. Rachel McAdams does a stunning job playing leader of the 'Plastics' Regina George where she's just catty enough to be seen as sort of an antagonist but not too much that it ruins the aesthetic of the film & a mention must be given to Amanda Seyfried for the brilliantly talented acting of the character Karen (your typical pretty but also pretty thick girl) all this with Fey's writing and good humoured portrayal of teacher Ms. Norbury and it's easy to see why this movie has helped launch careers of these actors and actresses (specifically Lohan)Having said that I would like to have seen the original characters stay or go back for a second movie without the need to potentially almost rush an ending like they did with Cady, Karen, Regina & Gretchen. It's like if they were to keep that ending but for the end of a second movie and have new events leading up to that.Overall though, a thoroughly enjoyable movie that made me laugh and had me rooting for Cady from almost the very beginning.

306,revpetebrazier,Hidden depth & commitment to comedy,9,28 November 2015,"The great joy of this film is the way that its finely crafted comic genius is dressed up to look, at least on the surface, like pretty much any other American high school movie. In reality the writing and acting stand head and shoulders (and in some cases all the way down to the feet) above most of the competition. Perhaps the only one that comes close is 'Get Over It'.Tina Fey humbly takes a back seat in the film leaving it to the younger folk to put her adaptation of Rosalind Wiseman's book into action. An adaptation made all the more interesting because 'Queen Bees and Wannabes' is a book of advice and illustrative accounts with no overall narrative.Both the younger actors and the SNL folk do a great job of portraying some serious sociological issues and exploring some of the complex power struggles of young women, yet this film never once takes its eye off the ball in its relentless commitment to the comedy. The best performance you will see from Lindsay Lohan, a characteristically great performance from Rachel McAdams and a quiet gem of a performance from Tim Meadows.It's also one of those films I can't help quoting and don't mind watching over and over again.

In her second day at school she meets Regina George (Rachel McAdams) and her group, the plastics, but she makes the mistake to fall in love with Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels, and when she realizes about it she takes Aaron back. So Cady, along with her friends Janis and Damian, start the revenge plan. Great movie, great screenplay by Tina Fey (I hope I will watch more movies based on screenplays written by her in the future), great performances. Don't miss Mean Girls. Score: 8/10",Mean Girls
311,buzzarb,"Funny, Smart, High School to a T",10,9 June 2005,"How many times have we've seen the regurgitated crap of teen movies dished out to us during the spring and summer months i.e. A Cinderella Story. It's pretty much sickening to see the same plot line where either geeky boy gets popular girl are geeky outcast girl gets popular boy. This premise is tired and frankly unrealistic and not true to high school life. Sure we'd all like to get with the most popular girl or guy in school but lets face it happy endings like that don't exactly happen in high school. Mean Girls represented high school life to a T. I found myself verbally expressing in the movie theater to my friends how true the lunch table scene was, i could just picture the people in my school and the different cliques. I knew people who belonged to these groups. Thats also what i loved about the movie it didn't just concentrate on one clique or group, even if you didn't belong to a group like the plastics you were still able to identify with a person in the film. The movie showed school for what it is, it's not all sunshine everyday you got people talking behind your back, and friends turning on you. It depicted well the way girls mess with each other, sense we're not really allowed to physically express our anger we do it sneakily and find a way to destroy people emotionally or their self esteem. This movie came out when I was a junior which I believe is the same grade the main characters were in. It was just really easy to relate to, smart and witty. I think it was said by Melissa Joan Heart in Drive Me Crazy ""When girls compete it's an art,"" and it truly is.",Mean Girls
312,musicgirl759119,"Finally, a Teen Comedy I can Enjoy.",8,18 March 2006,"Aah, Lindsay. From being a twin, then half of a mother-daughter switcharoo. No matter what you do, we'll never get tired of you.Cady (Lindsay Lohan) has lived in Africa for the first 15 years of her life. She thought that nothing was wilder than that. But then, she entered the crazy world of high school. She was suppose to be an outcast, as most new students are, but because of her beauty and poise is recruited but the beautiful and popular 'Plastics' led by Regina (Rachael McAdams.) Lindsay and Rachel are absolutely perfect together. They're both beautiful, young, talented actresses that are in their prime, and they intend to keep it that way. This movie shows exactly how high school was/is. If your looking for a good laugh, you should rent this movie. I definitely advice Jr. High kids to watch this movie, just to get ready for what you might be getting into and how to watch out for people like The Plastics.",Mean Girls

Mark Waters obviously didn't do his homework, i will name only one... granted i didn't notice this until i watched it for a second time, Tina Fey is the Math teacher of whom Lindsay Lohan only has for her senior math class (according to her schedule red at the beginning by Janis), and yet towards the end of the movie, miraculously, both Janis, Damien, and Lohan end up in the same class with Fey... amazing...Rachel McAdams and Tina Fey both work very hard to save this movie and make it somewhat worthwhile to view, as both deliver stellar performances. McAdams shines as a stuck-up stereotypical rich blonde public school teenager, and Fey is hilarious as woe-is-me single Math teacher.If your a fan of really badly scripted movies filled with errors, then i can honestly say this will be on your top 5 favorites of all time... right up there with Freaky Friday... yes i did see that too...",Mean Girls

For some time she got along well with them, but when Cady had a crush on Regina's ex-boyfriend, and Regina found out, she back-stabbed Cady, and Cady, along with two other friends, devised a plan for payback time, and the results were hilarious!

It was very Real, compare to other movies. Cady, A girl whose been home schooled her whole life, finally goes to a real school, full of preps, goths, geeks etc, and befriends two misfits, who want to get back at these popular girls called The Plastics, and the plastics want to befriend Cady, So Cady Uses The Plastics, and tries to screw them over and stuff. Its really enjoyable and fun!The funniest Part is the part were all the girls are saying sorry, then this fat random girl comes up. Ha Ha Go to the theaters and Watch it now.The only downfall for me was the ending wasn't that exciting, it was all like, Oh Accept yourselves and blah blah, end like a typical movie, but deserves nothing less than a 8/10!!!",Mean Girls

I have ONE major criticism that happens in quite a lot of American films. I refer to the scene where the character Regina is standing in the middle of the road arguing with the character Cady. She is there for a number of minutes which would have given any vehicles plenty of time to see her and stop. Yet she was still hit by a school bus.",Mean Girls

321,jwillis81,An SNL sketch played out for two hours.,6,9 May 2004,"The first half of Mean Girls was great.  It had all the humor and cleverness I've come to expect from Tina Fey as a writer.  The problem with the movie was that it seemed to drag out for the last two acts, with the jokes and gags coming less and less frequently.  If a feature movie were a marathon, the script sprints for the first third of the race, then runs out of steam and has to walk across the finish line.The concept was interesting, although the ""out of place girl at a new school"" is nothing we haven't seen before.  The story is interesting in that, instead of having Cady declare all-out war on the Plastics, she subtly tries to tear them apart from the inside, a welcome change from the typical story where they fight one another until a climactic food fight scene.  And although it's by no means unique to this film, it's always fun to watch a movie from an SNL castmember and try to spot all the fellow cast members they've buddied up with.  Tim Meadows is, by far, the best among them.Overall, the movie was this side of average.  It wasn't the greatest film I've ever seen, and I probably won't see it again (maybe when it comes out on video), but the bottom line is it's worth seeing once, and a good way to laugh a little on a Saturday night.",Mean Girls

323,ThatsWhatTheyTellMe,A hilarious modern classic that gives a fresh perspective to the horror that is high school.,9,15 March 2011,"Tina Fey wrote this film's hysterical screenplay and it is her best work to date seven years later. With a fresh-faced, instantly relateable Lindsay Lohan as our naive protagonist Cady Heron, we are ready to plunge into the always entertaining event that is ""Mean Girls."" Opposite our innocent heroine is the film's sexy villain that you secretly can't help but want to emulate: Regina George, portrayed with brilliance beyond her years by the gorgeous Rachel McAdams. Regina is the Queen Bee of the notorious Plastics, a trio of girls who rule the school where Cady is a new student. Cady is immediately pulled into their world of gossip, backstabbing, secrets, and social suicide. But Cady soon learns that if you mess with Regina, you'll be the victim of social HOMicide.Fey's brilliant script makes continual comparisons to the immaturity of high schoolers and animals in the jungle Cady grew up observing. The film has countless laugh out loud one-liners that people quote for fun as well as several memorable characters, such as the bad-ass Janis Ian, the anxious blabbermouth Gretchen Wieners, and the over-confident nerd known as Kevin G to name a few. The film's heart comes through towards the end and you're left in shock as you realize there is actually an important message regarding bullying in this movie.What better experience can you ask from a teen film than one that teaches a great lesson and makes you have insane amounts of laughter and joy learning it over and over? ""Mean Girls"" is a classic, quotable, re-watchable until the day you die kind of movie. And this is no exaggeration, it's THAT good.",Mean Girls
324,jay-schaffer,Very Hot,8,12 February 2021,"Who cares they are snotty? These maidens are hot. Thin and attractive and dieting to be even more attractive.

They also make me smile.",Mean Girls
325,AirheadWithAttitude,Ruthlessly On Target,8,24 January 2007,"Mean Girls focuses and portrays the life teenage girls go through in high school.Fifteen year-old Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is the ultimate outsider. Raised and home schooled in the African bush by her zoologist parents, she is an independent thinker and a very smart math student. But things don't add up when she enters North Shore High School in a small town outside of Chicago. The place is divided into so many cliques that she can't even decipher them all.Luckily, Cady is taken in by Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian (Daniel Franzese), who are self-described outsiders. She's an angry punk, and he's ""almost too gay to function."" They give her the scoop on the cliques, saving most of their venom for ""The Plastics,"" a trio of Barbie doll look-alikes led by Regina (Rachel McAdams), who thinks she is above everyone else. Her two dim-witted handmaidens are Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) and Karen (Amanda Seyfried). When they ask Cady to join their elite circle, she agrees to do, but only after secretly agreeing to be a spy for Janis and Damian. The animosities and gossip mongering begins in earnest when the newcomer gets a crush on Aaron (Jonathan Bennett), a handsome hunk in her calculus class. He was Regina's boyfriend until she ditched him, and now she's having second thoughts.This spiffy morality play has plenty of dramatic fireworks which are nicely orchestrated by director Mark Walters (Freaky Friday). The better-than-average screenplay by Tina Fey, a head writer on Saturday Night Live and co-anchor of the show's popular ""Weekend Update"" segment, is based on Rosalind Wiseman's best seller Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence. The film succeeds, in large part, because Lindsay Lohan is such a credible character as Cady, who just for trying to fit in finds herself on the slippery slope of social climbing, gossip, lying, and betrayal. Pandemonium breaks out in the school when a ""burn book"" full of nasty comments on most of the girls surfaces. Ms. Norbury (Tina Fey), Cady's math teacher, says: ""Calling somebody else fat will not make you any thinner. Calling somebody stupid will not make you any smarter. And you've got to stop calling each other sluts and whores. It just makes it all right for the guys to call you that."" Although this may strike some as too preachy, the film drives home the point that being cruel is no way to build up one's self-esteem. You become just as much a victim as the people on the other end of your mean and degrading behavior.Hilarious comedy. Recommended for anyone who likes such movies.Great acting, amazing plot and one of the best teen-flicks out there.8/10",Mean Girls

I loved it and want to see it again and again!In this movie you can really tell how Lindsay has really grown into a woman from the little girl you saw in the Parent Trap. I really recommend this movie to ANYONE!  I loved the animal scenes.  The bus scene.  But my favorite scene is when Lindsey is coming back from the Halloween party to her friends house.  And the gay guy and the girl are watching a scary movie.  Right when the door opens on the movie Lindsay bursts in.  Making them scream bloody murder and toss the popcorn.Another favorite part was when the Gay guy was singing ""Beautiful"" by Christina.",Mean Girls

I would recommend this movie if you are 16 and bored and happen to be a fan of teenybopper themed pictures. This one happens to be better than just about most of them out there. But that is certainly not saying much.",Mean Girls

This movie always can cheer me up, the soundtracks are cool as well! I can tell you that, Mean Gurl and Built This Way are the songs on my iPod even today. I strongly advise everyone to see this movie and learn a lesson. I think everyone can get something from this movie. Everything can find a part of themselves in it. Besides, it's really super funny.

It is much like the movie 13 (in the way that it deals w/ teen drama and is totally unrealistic) but is way too ditsy for any normal human. Too much of the movie is spent focusing on Lindsay Lohan. Her acting skills in this move are among the poorest of all her movies. She does not establish a relationship between herself and whoever watches the movies. she does not express the character's (Cady's) feelings in depth. If there were ever a movie to dramatize stereotypes more than they already have been by the media, this would be it. Cady's three ""friends"" are also of the same ditsy stereotype. If you are a stereotype or ditz, go ahead! Watch this movie and rot your braincells while doing it. Otherwise, I highly recommend that this movie is locked away for good.",Mean Girls

I thought this was going to be another shallow movie with two dimensional characters. Thankfully, my best friend set out to prove me wrong by having me watch it. I was surprisingly entertained throughout the whole thing.The characters in this movie surprised me greatly. Tina Fey created characters with depth and all of them were very relatable. They all have strong points and short comings. Best of all, the actors were talented enough to hit the nail right on the head of the performance.But of course, what I loved most about this movie was the fact that it really shows how bullying can tear a person apart. As a former big red target for bullies (I'm a slightly smaller target now), this really hit close to home and actually made me feel better about myself. This movie has intelligent humor and a good message that every girl (and guys too) should experience.All in all, the plot was realistic, the characters were amazing and the entire movie was full of laughs and wit. 10 stars and two thumbs up.",Mean Girls

I thought it was funny how they had all the former SNL cast members in the movie. Which only helped the movie. In a way this movie had some things that reminded of high school, but some of the stuff was too stereotypical. A lot of people are followers at that age, but maybe not too that extent. The plastics were a group of there own, self center and self absorbed. They do remind me of certain people I went to school with. The best message of the movie is too be yourself, but they don't show this until the end which kind of is a downer. If your a fan of teen movies then see this.

335,emnizzle_18,Pleasantly Surprising,9,31 July 2006,"I remember I first saw this movie in my high school film class. At first we were all stunned that we would be subjected to such teen melodrama and what a waste of time it would be.But who knew these girls could act and who knew that it was possible to make such a good movie about drama of high school- and its genuinely funny too.McAdams shines in her role as Queen Bee and Lindsay Lohan carries her lead role quite well. Tina Fey proves herself as a writer and actress and other cameos by SNL cast members are hilarious (bravo to Amy Poehler).The movie delves into the complicated world of teenage girls and accurately captures how they think, scheme, and act as well as the social hierarchy that exists. Particularly after reading the book the movie is partially based on, the movie does an excellent job of portraying girl behavior in a humorous (but unfortunately true) way that actually provides really good entertainment. I was completely surprised and no matter how much I tried, I loved it and now own it.",Mean Girls

It takes an interesting and ironic look at the jealousy, deceit, and just plain bitchiness of high school; in a way that every teenage girl can relate to. Instead of the usual bathroom humor you expect from this genre, ""Mean Girls"" has a great (though slightly cliche) plot and is written very smartly (thanks to Tina Fey, head writer over yonder at ""Saturday Night Live""). The acting from Lohan was solid, and Rachel McAdams gave a flawless portrayal of the ultimate evil teen queen. You'll love all the quirky minor characters ""jungle"" sequences. ""Mean Girls"" has a lot of heart, and an actual moral---cliques are pointless. Overall this film is worth watching! 7/10",Mean Girls

Lindsay plays Cady, a homeschooler from Africa who's suddenly forced to cope with life in an American public highschool. The movie completely captures a homeschooler's reactions to school; where for some strange reason you have to get a pass just to leave the room, adults don't trust you, and you have to choose between being a nerd and getting good grades or failing with friends.In the manner of all classic chick flicks (like ""Clueless"", ""Legally Blonde"", and ""Romey & Michelle's Highschool Reunion"") this movie is fun and uplifting, with a ""be happy with who you are"" message.

Lindsay Lohan has a lot of talent and Rachel McAdams was the perfect girl they chose for the leader of the plastics. However, in my opinion, it was a little to stereotypical. I don't know about other high schools, but mine really isn't like that. Yes, there are the popular people and the not so popular people...but as far as I know...girls do not battle it out and have some sort of group where only certain people are aloud and other people are really envious of them. There aren't really distinct groups like band club, drama geeks, etc, etc. It may be like that at other schools but not mine. It is true, some popular students don't talk to the underdogs, but this movie I guess is just way to valley girl or something. It was still good though.",Mean Girls
341,tom_euro,How do we identify ourselves,10,15 December 2007,"When I first began watching this movie, I wasn't expecting much and I'm sure that went for thousands of others around the world as well. Reason being for the past ten years the classic high school formula had been experimented with over and over to produce mediocre results. Examples being She's All That, 10 Thing I Hate About You, Never Been Kissed, arguably unique in their own right. But, following the formula of romance and high school mixed in with the 'class system' of a high school.One could say Mean Girls follows this exact formula, but cleverly enough Tina Fey was able to mutate this formula in to sheer brilliance. What sets this film aside from other high school movies, is how people identify themselves and other around them. The scene in which Janis (Caplan) is giving Cady (Lohan) the guide to North Shore she stereotypes the usual groups, ''You got your freshmen, ROTC guys, preps, J.V. jocks, Asian nerds, Cool Asians, Varsity jocks Unfriendly black hotties, Girls who eat their feelings, Girls who don't eat anything, Desperate wannabes, Burnouts, Sexually active band geeks'' and then in what is a stroke of genius Janis identifies herself and Damian as ''the greatest people you will ever meet''. While later on in the movie, Gretchen (Chabert) refers to them as ''art freaks''. The film itself centres on the three popular girls, whom acquire the name 'The Plastics'. However we never hear 'The Plastics' referring to themselves as that. Nor, does any other 'group' refer to themselves as a certain name. I think this is what made this movie so appealing, the fact that anyone could identify themselves with the characters and 'groups' of Mean GirlsThe script is a stroke of genius from brilliant screenplay writer (and actor) Tina fey. The script is well structured, witty and intelligent, without being too overbearing. The amount of 'one-liners' that have worked their way in to every day use is unreal, how often do I hear people quote the infamous saying ''Boo, you whore!'' and ''fugly slut''The Mean Girls cast is unforgettable probably Lindsay Lohan's best performance to date. Certain members of the cast stole the show though namely Rachel McAdams, who gives an impressive performance of 'queen bee' Regina George. The scene in which she does the high pitched scream in her frustration after the understanding of betrayal against her is magnificent. Lizzy Caplan also deserves a mention for a terrific performance of rocker, Janis Ian. Mean Girls will be known as one of the classic high school movie in ten years time, it will be up there along side the Sixteen Candles, American Pie and the almighty Breakfast Club",Mean Girls

Even when I flip through TV stations, this is one movie that I always stop on and can't stop watching. My sister once laughed as we had two tvs in her basement. She was watching the hockey game on a big screen TV, and her husband and I were consumed by mean girls on a small 18 inch TV. This is a classic that people will be entertained by for a long time.

But anyway enough of my personal life back to the movie. A great movie not a fan of Lindsay Lohan but Rachael I'm quiet in love with. I read some of the comments made on this movie and I'm quiet surprised to see that it's rated quiet high.

It suffers from some weak editing at points, and dismal character development and portrayal of the adults. Tim Meadows character in particular never seems able to treat the serious issues he must confront with, well, seriousness. Regina's mom is a true caricature, but sadly so close to reality the movie may get a nomination in the documentary category. ""Health class"" is clearly ""as viewed thru the eyes of teenagers.""The redeeming value and message of the movie will likely be lost on the age group which will most identify with the humor and ""realness"" of it. This is NOT a movie for kids under 8, and probably not for kids under 13, as words like ""bitch"" and ""whore"" fly fairly freely. It probably IS a movie for parents to see with their teenage children as fodder for later discussion.Despite the uplifting ending, it was a shame to see Cady (Lindsay Lohan), whose character at the beginning of the movie is pure, sweet, trusting, intelligent, and wholesome, become so corrupted by so many forces (hormones, peer pressure, revenge) in so many ways. You would think that her parents (who had homeschooled her in Africa) would have instilled in her the wisdom and self confidence to read people better and make better choices. Perhaps the point is that despite how well we prepare our children, they must still make mistakes and find their own way. Cady does enough of both to make for a very funny and thought-provoking movie.",Mean Girls

Even within its era, it is painfully bad, full of cliches and a meandering plot which is extremely predictable. Girl joins a clique. She betrays the clique. Clique is angry. Girl realises she was wrong and apologises. Friendships are saved. The end. There is nothing groundbreaking or exciting about the film, it's just a poorly conceived, disordered ""film"" that should, ideally, be avoided completely.

It is amazing how much storyline the movie covers, considering how much in detail each personality is shown.Oh yeah, and it's really funny too! There's funny scenes all throughout the movie, of course, and, of course, depending on your personality, you might find some more funny than others, but this is especially true in this movie.

354,thecoloroftea,It's a movie about mean girls.,3,19 February 2015,"This is a movie starring Lindsay Lohan, who must deal with stereotypes in a high school. These stereotypes include the popular girls who are mean (as the title suggests), a handsome boy who has seemingly no flaws and exists solely to be a crush to Lindsay Lohan, and the outcasts who consist of a quasi-goth and a man who's personality, as I assume was written in the script, is: he's gay. What I find interesting about this movie is that the only characters I enjoy watching are the ones I'm not supposed to like. These characters are the mean girls themselves, of which the outcasts do not like one bit. Lindsay Lohan befriends these outcasts, and the quasi-goth tells Lindsay never to associate with the mean girls. This is of course followed immediately by Lindsay associating with the mean girls. Lindsay's friendship with the outcasts ends after this. Really, that's it. The rest of the movie is Lindsay getting to know the mean girls, and 'discovering' herself. As it turns out, she's just as bad as they are, but she can mask it better.The audience is supposed to believe that the outcasts are good, and the mean girls are, well, not. But that's my gripe: Lindsay actually has a better friendship with the mean girls than with the outcasts. Sure the mean girls may be mean, but Lindsay changes and evolves with them over the course of the movie, all the while uncovering her own inner demons, as well as theirs, and actually getting to know each other. And yes, Lindsay may go her own way in the end, but she had an actual relationship with these girls. Compare that to her relationship with the outcasts:Quasi-goth: ""You're our new friend.""Lindsay: ""Cool.""Gay guy: ""I'm gay.""Lindsay: ""I'm gonna go over there"" (goes to hangout with the mean girls. Doesn't come back until the end of the movie)-at the end of the movie-Lindsay: Hey, so we're still friends, right?Quasi-goth: Yes.Gay guy: *does stereotypical gay thing*Whew, glad she's back with her real friends, right? Remember all those hardships they overcame? Like when they greeted each other? Or when Lindsay confessed her feelings for the handsome boy? Oh wait, no, that last one she did with the mean girls. Along with everything else in the movie. It's not like I expect literary greatness from a movie like this, but I'd prefer it if the movie stuck to the 'love to hate these guys' thing instead of pushing its confused morals on us. Who are we supposed to be rooting for? Lindsay's just as big of a jerk as the mean girls, and so are the outcasts. At least the mean girls are supposed to be hated, which brings about a certain satisfaction, but I can't stand the outcasts either. In fact, I hate them even more because they're the ones who come out on top in the end, I think. All that aside though, this movie's pretty good for a laugh at the sheer corniness, if you're into that sort of thing.",Mean Girls
355,nightblade00,"I hate Chick Flicks, but this one is Good",8,14 May 2004,"The writing made this film (Bravo SNL's Tina Fey). Every part of this movie is well done, and its actually laugh a minute funny, unlike most of the recent comedies that have been shoveled to the public.The style of the movie works because the Director, Mark Waters, (The House of Yes) makes great use of the very effective prose without getting lost in the scenery. The teen stars do an effective job of portraying their characters, and Lindsay Lohan's voice overs (something I usually think symbolizes bad directors and screenwriters) work very well. The quality of this film should have been worse but it wasn't. It is definitely worth checking out.",Mean Girls
356,marytothemax,Surprisingly Good,8,9 February 2008,"I watched this film because all of my friends had seen it and I was not going to be out of the loop any longer. I was very glad I did. This film is about high school cliques, so it has to be dumb, right? Nope. This is no Saved By the Bell. The story is actually quite unique (though I think there may have been a couple of similar movies I have not watched). Basically, Cady (Lohan) is experiencing high school for the first time, because she has been home schooled in Africa her whole life. She immediately makes friends with two lovable outsiders who convince her to hang out with the ""Plastics"", a vicious clique of beautiful girls, and then report back to them so they can laugh at how stupid the Plastics are. Unfortaunatley, Cady soon becomes one of them and loses her initial friends. I liked this film because we actually got an in-depth look at what really goes on in a clique like the Plastics. We saw the betrayal, gossip, and down-right b**chiness that, as a high school girl, I am all-too-familiar with. We see Cady get sucked into their world, then realize that there is no substance to it. It was non-cliché for the most part, and very well casted. Another of its merits is that it's not a film that only teenage girls will like. Most people should enjoy this movie (not the kids, though, the word 'slut' is tossed around a little too much for it to be appropriate for them) because most people have experienced high school first hand. All in all, its a great movie that I highly recommend!!!",Mean Girls
357,WillCNixonJR,"Hilarious, perfect, great cast and perfomances",9,1 May 2004,"From its trailer MEAN GIRLS looked too good to be true and having longly anticipating this movie (being an SNL film, looking hilarious, and with a cast of really hot girls) I braced myself for a let-down, thinking that the trailer might have given away all of its funny parts.However, I soon found that this was the funniest movie since School of Rock, Old School, and The Hot Chick. The jokes were totally original (although some might find them a bit offensive) and the complete idea for such a movie was perfect and executed without flaw.The story is also very engaging. There are twists and surprises and even some meaning at the very well-decided ending.Last but not least, another one of this movie's very strong aspects was its cast.Lindsay Lohan has definately matured as the young actress she was in THE PARENT TRAP - her acting is excellent because she captures the character of a high-school junior completely oblivious to such a complicated and foreign culture of teenagers. She is funny at times and carries the story very professionally.Rachel McAdams, a newer actress landed her first lead role in this film after a somewhat recent and smaller part in THE HOT CHICK (2002). In MEAN GIRLS McAdams convincingly plays the antagonist ""Regina George"" and is one of the funniest parts of the movie.Tina Fey, being the writer and a former SNL star, is great too. Lacey Chabert was probably the best performance in the film because she was outright hilarious and perfect for the part.Mean Girls was very funny but would probably appeal mostly to teenagers in the American school system because of how suprisingly closely we can relate to the ridiculous events and characters in this movie. Teens from all high-school cliques and stereotypes will get a kick out of it. It is definately not a chick-flick, guys will like this movie all the same because of so many dirty jokes and skimpy playboy Halloween costumes. Excellent movie. 9/10",Mean Girls
358,Mauri8396,Surprisingly good,8,8 March 2013,"I do not recall when I gave this a ""not interested"" rating on Flixster, but looking back, it is clearly the worst case of judging a book by its cover on my part.When I started watching this movie I wasn't expecting anything better than your average groan-worthy high school movie.It turned out to be quite awesome.For those unfamiliar with them, the movie gives a good (and tongue-in-cheek) rundown of the stereotypes of the American high school. It also details the remarkable transformation of its main character from a naive ""Good Samaritan"" to well, you'll see precisely what in the movie (and she does describe the process in a voice-over herself)A certain amount of suspension of belief was needed for Regina's two sidekicks and how the high school community just went along with whatever she did all the time. However, I think those elements of the movie sustained its comedic aspect and kept it from sliding completely into a teen drama, a genre in which I think some of its other faults wouldn't have been able to slide. The voice-over itself was also an unusual but welcome source of comedy.All in all, my rating might be a little inflated by my fascination with the stereotypical American high school world and my own nostalgia for the real one, but that does not mean the film is any less interesting (for analytical teenagers, at least).",Mean Girls
359,adhithya1993,American high school teen drama that's surprisingly entertaining,7,8 July 2019,"In a movie that ends with Cady (how's it pronounced again? Sa-di right?) learning about being ""human"", the stage lights of a storyline, held together probably by the compassion of the audience in relation to their own loosely related memories, are cast mainly upon a group of NorthShore High girls and their drama with the new student testing the clique waters being the vessel.From being manipulated by ""I know I'm mean so it's okay, but you don't hence not"" hipster girl and her own petty revenge ideas along with her buoyant (gay? I couldn't tell) friend/accomplice, to being part of the ""popular girls"" a.k.a the 'plastics', about whom the rest of the class can't seem to make up their mind about loving or hating (or are they actually split? Is the Spring Fling voting a legitimate enfranchisement to count on?), to becoming the reason for a bonding exercise, a mathlete state championship and an overall overhaul of the attitude of not just their circle but the entire class (that might or might not have been due to an Opera style ""You get a crown! You get a crown! You get a crown!"" speech) all that's well seems to end well for Cady.A movie in which the actually subtle but brilliant expressions of the background characters is overthrown by it's self-aware overplayed ""meant-to-be-subtle"" expressions of the main characters, the storyline spun in the mystical American High School worlds, the iconicism of which movies like Easy A or even Never Back Down and many others try to emulate, are as naive as Lindsay Lohan probably during the time of this movie but entertaining nonetheless as the actual story of Lindsay Lohan's life.",Mean Girls

366,erin1786,Doesn't everyone vent their rage by throwing artwork?,4,14 May 2007,"I must confess I never joined the Mean Girls bandwagon. I still can't get the hype that surrounds it. That is not to say I think it the most putrid piece of bile ever put to celluloid, and for its teen flick genre, I suppose it fares better than the classic ""girl from wrong side of the tracks has the most pivotal moment of her life at prom because that is always the pinnacle of one's existence,"" but I'm just not jumping out of my chair. To counter the praise, this isn't the high school experience. It's usually quite a bit more boring than that. This is just more of the same clichés with a few cast members from SNL.To its credit, there were several humorous lines, and the acting wasn't horrid. This is also the more endearing Lindsay, who looks healthy and normal and has an appreciation for underwear. As to my criticisms...first off, must EVERY movie centered around high school include the preppy popular bitch queens from hell? I'm not sure where everyone else went to high school, but for my own experience, I can't recall being in the hall and have the students part like the Red Sea as the Prom Queen and her entourage walked past in slow motion as random music from nowhere began to play. And never quite clear to me was the 180 made by Cady's (Lindsay Lohan) friends, the token quasi-goth and gay boy. They seemed to force her into the ""Plastics sabotage,"" and yet the next thing the audience knows they are inexplicably intoxicated and driving past Cady's house to cry and throw a painting at her. Did I miss something?? She THROWS a PAINTING. Why does she drive around with a painting? And for our film's climax, rather than keeping it between Ms. Cady, the Plastics, and those connected to that particular circle, we are rather reduced to a giant kerfuffle involving EVERY girl in the junior(?) class. Only the girls. Only this particular year. But all out fisticuffs. So they are forced into an emergency assembly to learn the meaning of friendship and goodwill towards men.Right.In the end, after a very random bus collision and a mathlete competition, everyone is happy and well-adjusted, everyone gets along. It appears that high school has suddenly lost its trite hierarchy and they are now egalitarian and welcoming. And someone has breasts that predict the weather.",Mean Girls

I also like the opening scene when Cady first arrives at the high school. Also my favorite quote from this movie is "" So you agree-you think you're really pretty?""

371,davidorsarah,I really like this movie,10,29 December 2006,"I really do like this movie. In so many ways it is so much like real life, but then in a lat of ways it isn't fully correct. Says a girl who is 21 years old and was in High School not too long ago. And I have a fifteen year old sister who I'm very close to, and we talk about everything. I like that they made the Plastics the most beautiful girls in school, and Every girl wants to look like them. You can try to hide it (Janis) but in reallity you'd pay a million bucks to look like them for a day. I hate it how they make it such a big deal to skinny. When I was in school there was a few girls who had a little meat on there bones that was the most popular and they were gorgeous. In fact it was the not so popular ones, like me, That were skinnier than the preps (Another name for plastics) and they were still worried about there weight. And the thing that bothers me so much is that in a way it makes teens look a little shallow. Yeah girls do always worry about what they look like, but they don't talk about just that. I've overheard a lot of conversations that the preps have had and they do care about other stuff that there looks and boys. They worry about their grades and sports and they care about their friends and family. It's more the Non-preps that care about what they look like. They see that the Preps are so pretty and thats what must be what makes them, them. So they get so wrapped up in looking like them. I did like how they pointed out that in High School there is a click for everyone, but it's not just like thoughts are the only people who you talk to. Each click sort of blends in with another. They preps and the Jocks hang out together, sometimes the burnouts and the preps hang out together. Another thing, The whole "" Like "" this and ""Like "" that don't happen anymore. They don't where skirts in High school, and Especially that short. 9/10 of every school in the US have a dress code, and short skirts are a no no. I do like the basic outline of the movie. You DO hate the girl who has your man. You do want revenge to anyone who does or says something to you, although in the present day, most do actually beat the crap out of each other.

And the crew of actors really showed they got their stuff. I also thought the script was great (Haha,mostly because Tina Fey wrote it.) But personally, I love how the movie teaches the viewers the ""women's side of things"". It's really hard to explain.

When I went to the theater to watch it, I was just expecting one more stupid teenage blockbuster, but it really surprised me. I got to see great acting from actresses I didn't expect to be great.

381,AvantGardePineapple,First half is brilliant; falls apart halfway through.,8,15 July 2010,"The first half of Mean Girls is a masterpiece. The character dynamics are extremely sophisticated. Lindsay Lohan's character transforms so perfectly throughout the the first half that it's hard to notice exactly how much she's changed unless we take a moment to recap.Despite the nearly flawless beginning, the movie falls apart in the second half. You see, it's very obvious the writer had a specific ending in mind, and the movie takes up a bunch of unbelievably stupid plot twists in order to get there. And I'm not just talking about one plot twist. The viewer is bombarded with absurdity pretty much until the credits roll.I still think Mean Girls is an enjoyable film; it's definitely one of the least objectionable films in what I'd like to dub the contemporary ""slumber party film canon."" But it could have been so much more. Mean Girls honestly could have been, by all conceivable measures, the greatest chick flick ever. I would even argue Mean Girls had the potential to be one of the finest examples of contemporary film if it were just a little more polished and had a less contrived second half.The writer (Tina Fey) made two mistakes. First, Fey got lazy. Second, Fey wrongly believed that the film's status as a superficial teen comedy permitted her to abandon all rhyme and reason whenever she felt like it, even though the first half of the film was consistently tame and realistic.Ostensibly, Mean Girls is a chick flick with jaded lessons on ""true friendship."" It can also be viewed as an illustrative guide to modern teenage psychology (which is appropriate, given that the film is loosely based around a self-help book by Rosalind Wiseman).

containing the current crop of ""it"" talent (from the soundtrack to the actors) the film says nothing of any important whatsoever, offers nothing new and has very little to keep the viewer occupied. lindsay lohan is pretty, but it sure isn't enough to carry a film anymore. given her past (freaky friday.. hmm you mean the remake of the ""its been done a million times"" idea of bodyswapping? yawn) she's going to have to make a massive rolereversal soon before she's typcast into these boring predictable roles.as for the film itself? the story seems to be, you can be an a**hole and screw over everyone, yet you'll still be popular enough to win prom queen, and even more so if you give a 10 sec half assed apology saying how wrong you were and how you've changed. such a strong moral message for the nations youth im sure.and so on to the good points. well, neil flynn (known mainly for the janitor in scrubs) is the father, and gets a good 3 lines. oh and they played orbitals Halcyon On and On at the end. yep, a good 2mins that didn't totally bore me.crap? you betcha. mean girls is shoddily put together, and seems a waste of money and also 90mins. there's zero redeeming features and i think i might've smiled about 3 times during the whole film. predictable and tiresome, yet popular amongst todays movie going youth.

383,KramerTM,"Better Than I Expected, But I Didn't Expect Much",7,11 April 2004,"The movie was written by Tina Fey, so it obviously couldn't have been God-awful.  All the cliches are present in this one, including the FINAL DESTINATION bus one.  I have to admit though, the film had me laughing more than I thought I would.  Most of the humor is absolutely crude, and that gags have all been seen before, but you won't hate yourself if you pay to see this one.",Mean Girls
384,weirdg,Much better then I expected,6,16 April 2004,"This movie was a lot better then I was expecting.  I thought it would be a typical teen flick... usually dull, but when I saw Lorne Michaels name pop up during the opening credits then I thought it couldn't be that bad.... especially since a few members of the SNL cast were in this movie.  The movie totally relates to the life of a typical teenager.  The back-stabbing, the lies, the envy, the glamour... it had it all.  This was a decent movie to see, and definitely worth paying for.  Lindsay Lohan's character reminds us of how it feels to be the new kid in school, and what it takes to fit in. Tina Fey did a terrific job writing this movie since it was her first, and hopefully she continues to write scripts.All in all, Lindsay Lohan's character is lovable and I'm sure many girls can relate to some of the characters in this movies.",Mean Girls
385,mvattivo,"A lot of it has been done before, but the acting pulls through!",7,13 May 2004,"Well, this was another teenage movie.  It had the exaggerated cliques, the main character who forgets her morals only to come back to them in the end, and the ending dance (Prom, Spring Fling, etc.)  These are common in all teen movies and have been done before.However, what makes ""Mean Girls"" pull through as a good movie is the acting performances.  I thought SNL vets Tina Fey, Tim Meadows, and Amy Poehler came up big in this one.  All three of the ""Plastics"" were terrific and Lindsay Lohan is a great young actress.  Lohan is sexy and sweet, but, I must say that Lacey Chabert has turned into an absolute knockout! Watching her and Lindasy for 2 hours is worth the price of admission alone.  All in all, I thought this was a good, not great movie.  A few laughs, but nothing that had me rolling in the aisles.My Rating:  7/10",Mean Girls
386,umbopa,More Than Comedy,7,18 December 2004,"An triangle combination, the Plastic, consisted of 3 hot girls in a high school. Meanwhile, a family moved to the neighbourhood from Africa, whose daughter, Cady Heron, had to be fit for her completely new schooled-education system after her home-educated ways by her mother. You know, all the gals in this school, have their own secrets and an uncontrollable trend to talk bad words behind others, especially the Plastic. It's natural for most guys to rise dislikes of the Plastic, as Cady was appointed to be NO.4 of the Plastic to smash it through a serious planning schedule after great hurts by the so-called leader Regina George who taked the guy Cady liked from. They made it and gradually the triangle's castle was going to break down one by one. But unfortunately, the naive and pure Cady lost herself and slipped into become a ""REAL"" Plastic due to her pretending being a royal member to be NO.4, which propelled her to do so much things like the Plastic bitched-behavior from others eyes. Finally, the volcano erupted as all the bad words behind others were releasing by Regina's mean thought. The deputy of the school called on all gals to unveil their attitudes towards others in gym. With the teachers' smart and effective efforts, Cady and all other girls got their points they are indeed worth treasuring, that is be SINCERE and KIND to all. More fascinating after the whole widespread opening-heart of all gals in the school was to capture the winner of maths competition by the final strike of the cool Cady and to regain the admiration and love from his all-days-liked guy through Cady's courage to admit her blunder in the class and emphatic talkings to re-unit all guys at the annual Party.Reading from the tile, the first impression from my mind is that Mean Girls is just a comedy taking place in campus. Laughing will be the only memory, but I definitely made the mistake. In this cruel and competitive society, its a challenge for picking up SINCERITY and KINDNESS being a theme to reveal and call for more people living in the one globe to stop intimidation toward the guys around them. Maybe SINCERITY is far from to reach, but at least, the bottom line of the mankind is to cease hurts, intimidation and mean assaults. RATING: 6.8/10",Mean Girls
387,hsucf,Not another mindless teenage movie,8,4 July 2004,"This is probably the best teenage movie I have watched. Not quite the ordinary teenage movie, it is still packed with stupid (but entertaining) teenage stuff except that it also has an educational twist. It scored high points because1. It takes viewers into the stupid (and perhaps fictitious) teenage girls' world of pointless mind games.2. Cady's imagination/fantasy is brilliantly executed. Don't you just love the scene when, through her eyes, wild animals gathered at the fountain in the mall?3. It retains the wild element of the teenage genre. Some parts are really exaggerating. If you watched closely enough you might have noticed that on Cady's first day of school, she saw some lunatic students burning a shirt (or paper) on the lawn. Another crazy event is when Regina made the whole grade riot. I'd also never have thought of a cafeteria map that gets you to safe waters. But let's not forget that exaggeration = entertainment.I'd like to call it the female version of American Pie. In many aspects, I think this movie is even better than American Pie. I think this movie deserves 7.5 points. Strongly recommended.",Mean Girls

That's all I can say after i've just watched this movie! :)This is really the best high-school comedy of this year! I haven't seen a hilarious teen/high-school comedy for a long time like ""Mean Girls"".Lindsay Lohan is absolutely the best teen actress, she demonstrated it again! I really like her, and her act....she is sexy, beautiful and talented.The director, Mark S. Waters made an excellent, funny teen comedy, just like his last movie ""Freaky Friday"". It seems that Waters and Lindsay are the winning duo for an AMAZING teen comedy!The story is about a 16 year-old girl, Cady (Lohan) who lived in Africa but now moved into the USA, and say ""Hello"" to an American high-school. She has a choice to join the ""normal"" students, or to join the ""low-IQ-plaza-chicks"", called The Plastics. This choice goes harder, when Cady fall in love with a boy, who was an ex-boyfriend of the leader girl of Plastics. The rivalry begins, and it carries a lot, a very lot of fun!To summarize the movie, it is simply the BEST teen comedy of the year!! It's an excellent work, the cast and the acts are really good. It is full of fun, jokes, and wit. And Lindsay is still hot :)I really suggest You to see this hilarious comedy! You won't regret!Rate: 10/10Seth",Mean Girls
389,lskywalk,Some fresh air.,8,9 October 2004,"Based on the Novel, Queen Bees and Wannabees, Tina Fey looks at high school girls in a very anthropological perspective. The way girls treat each other, the games they play and tactics that they use to deal with each other, is something very American, and very distinct. Fey avoids in her script to take a sappy and melodramatic approach to this material, but instead goes for satire and biting humor. We met Cady Herron (Lindsey Lohan), who has been home schooled in the African bush by her Zoologist parents her entire life, and suddenly is placed in a middle American public high school. She meets several people, and befriends Janice (Lizzy Caplan), a sassy Goth, and Damien, who is described as ""Too gay to function. She also meets the rulers on campus, and the true mean girls, The Plastics. The Plastics are the wealthiest and trendiest girls at North Shore High, and they are lead by the iron fist of Regina, played by Rachel McAdams. Her sidekicks are Gretchen (Lacey Chabert), and Karen (Amanda Seyfried). Cady then must participate in a game of survival of the fittest to try to assimilate in modern American teenage life, and the results from this game will give her lessons she will never forget. Fey's quick and smart script is matched with Waters' fast-paced film with lush colors and fun editing. While some critics of Saturday Night Live say that the show is going down, you cannot deny the fierce talent of Tina Fey, one of SNL's head writers, who works just as hard with this film, and provides some classic one-liners ("" Oh my god, Danny Devito, I love your work!""). I especially enjoyed her detail of all of the characters, and the performances that the script supplied. I enjoyed how fun and companionable Janice and Damien were, and Caplan performance was especially affecting, and she hit all the right notes. I also enjoyed Fey's treatment of The Plastics. Instead of making these girls the cliché of the one-dimensional pretty faces, she gives each plastic her own identity, and we can see how each girl acts they way they do. Rachel McAdams is brilliant as the cool and calculating Regina. She is nice in the beginning, and as situations worsen, she becomes hostile and cruel. And based on her home life, how can you blame her. Amy Poehler makes a hilarious appearance as Regina's slutty, super-cool mom who seems to be doing an impersonation of Holly Hunter's character in ""Thirteen"". Lacey Chabert plays a character everyone familiar with: the best friend who is always one step behind The Best, and resents it, yet never challenges the title. Seyfried is also lovable and the lame-brained bimbo of the group. Lohan soars above everyone else in a star making role. She plays a character that you have to instantly like and sympatyize with, because she makes certain mistakes throughout the film, and we have to always be rooting for her. Lohan is by nature, likable, yet she gives a very Eve Harrington-like role as the new girl who watches everything very closely, and she catches on quicker that anyone expected. My one complaint of the film however, was in Waters' direction. He goes for the bright colors and upbeat self-loving style of Amy Heckerlings ""Clueless"" rather than a more darker take, that Fey's script definitely possesses. But running at about an hour and a half, Mean Girls flies by with sheer entertainment, and it never gets old.",Mean Girls

391,ashlykuruthukulam,On Wednesdays we wear pink!,7,30 September 2014,Mean girls is a classic movie that almost everyone has seen. From the little funny comments to the drama filled movie all around the film is interesting! Watching the movie again for like the hundredth time I've noticed different styles the director uses to bring it all together. For example when Cady first meets Aaron there's a soft focus showing that she likes him and vice versa. Also the diegetic sound when the mean girls are at the mall and when Regina's sister is watching TV making you feel as though you are there with them. Then later on the Dutch angle to show how she was changing into a mean girl after all. The director was able to allow everyone who ever went yo school relate to the movie in some way from the cliques to throwing parties. The film is mainly a medium shot and when two people have a conversation it switches from one person to the other. All in all the way mean girls was directed made it a pretty good movie.,Mean Girls

At times it's so ridiculous that its funny, and other times its just, well, funny! But it's not just laughs. It shows how mean girls can really be when it comes to boys, popularity, and social status. Even if it's a little bit over-exaggerated (but that's what makes this movie great!), it's got so much truth to it! Cady Haren has been living in Africa for say about 12 years (her parents are zoologists), but when her mom's job forces the Harens to move back to the U.S., Cady must face high school. She has been home schooled since Kindergarden, and she has no idea on what to expect for her Junior Year. She soon becomes friend with ""social outcasts"" Janice and Damien, but also becomes in the inner-core with the Plastics, the most popular girls in school. But when Cady falls for Regina, the ""queen bee""'s ex-boyfriend, its mean girls at their worst. Highly entertaining, but there is also depth and meaning to it too. It's a total chick-flick, but guys have been known to love it too! I mean, who couldn't love this work of cinematic brilliance?10/10 Go see it...You won't regret it.",Mean Girls

When I watch it, I thought it was pretty good, but after, I thought it was kind of boring. You might want to watch it and I think it's not too bad. I would suggest you watch it though because a lot of other movies have similar plots and similar humors in it. But you can decide for yourself. I mean, it's not bad, just OK!!

395,violetstar1026,surprisingly educational,8,18 November 2007,"If you were a prep, J.V. jock, burnout, sexually active band geek, or someone that just wanted to fit in while in high school, this movie has a place for you. Mean Girls centers around Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), a teenage girl home-schooled in Africa until her junior year of high school after her parents decide that she needs to be socialized. She goes through the typical trials and tribulations of social life throughout high school with the ""plastics,"" the popular crowd.The movie was written by Tina Fey, a Saturday Night Live alum, and one of the stars of the movie. She has written a commentary on teenage life in high school. One of the things covered in the movie is the idea of popularity and what it represents to youth. High school popularity seems to equate to clothes, make-up, thinness, and money. In one scene, the head of the plastics has gained weight and is trying on dresses for the dance. She is struggling to get the dress on and asks for a bigger size. The sales clerk replies, ""Sorry, we only carry sizes 1, 3, and 5. You could try Sears."" The plastics also have a ""rulebook"" of what is appropriate to wear to school each week. They feel the need to look made up every day. At one point Cady comments, ""I used to think there was just fat and skinny. But apparently there's lots of things that can be wrong on your body."" The film also addresses the issue of cliques. The beginning of the film starts out with a friend describing the seating in the cafeteria. Each group is labeled and described in five words or less. Towards the end of the movie, the junior girls are given an impromptu workshop on how to treat each other with more respect. Fey points out that all teenage girls are insecure and go through mostly the same problems. Another issue addressed at the workshop is the usage of terms such as ""skank, ho, and slut."" Throughout the movie, leading up to this scene, these terms are used often, and mostly by young females. Fey points out, ""Well, I don't know who wrote this book, but you all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores. It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores."" The movie is rated PG-13 for sexual content, language, and some teen partying. While this movie has some risqué material, it has several underlying messages that can actually be educational for children and parents. This messages include how to treat people with respect, responsible decision-making, and the roles played in high school.This is an excellent movie for parents and teenagers to watch together. Not only will it entertain both, but will help to create a useful conversation about the issues in teenage life.",Mean Girls

There are so many other movies out there, that are more relatable and real to the life of teenagers. Most of the characters in this movie are extremely unlikeable also. I was extremely disappointed that Rachel McAdams would even agree to star in this film, she is much better in more mature, classy roles. And as much as I love Rachel, she was also unlikeable in this movie. The characters aren't deep or developed, they are all stock characters. You don't feel bad for any of the characters because they are not relatable, it's like they're not human. Not to mention, even when the lead character, Cady cries, it's like she's not even going through a rough time, it's just not believable. I guess what I'm trying to say is, Lindsay Lohan isn't that great of an actress.",Mean Girls
405,JwiseN,Mean Girls is the highlight of Lindsay Lohan's career,10,28 February 2009,"Mean Girls is an excellent teen high school drama film with a great cast that sells some of the movie's contrived parts.*CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS* Plot: Cady Heron has been raised in Africa for the last fifteen years of her life and when she enters public school for the first time she's about to discover that Africa is a lot tamer. Surrounded by all the cliques and groups she is instantly taken in by the outcasts, but she finds a home in the popular group and discovers that high school is all about love, lies, deception, and the occasional class assignment.The script is sharply written and it's one of the film's strongest points. It's witty, clever, and actually incorporates some great twists in the mix. The portrayal of cliques and popularity is portrayed very accurately and true to life. Another plus this movie has going for it is its cast. Lindsay Lohan gives the performance highlight of her career and it's not hard to see why she became a major star after this. How she played Cady was extremely important to the believability of the plot, but she hits all the right notes. She's very convincing as a girl who's out of her element, sort of naive, and just wants to be popular which is what practically what every teenager wants.Moving on, Rachel McAdams is the greatest mean girl to hit the screen in a long time. She's very cunning and calculating and knows what she wants and goes after it. There's such an air of cockiness and pettiness about her, but I found her to be likable especially when she got hit by the bus. That speaks volumes about the actor and the depths to her.The rest of the cast all performs well above average and all of them were likable to some degree. Nobody fails to impress here. The movie also gets some good laughs mainly with Amanda Seyfried's character and the whole debate over what grounded meant was pretty funny.Really the whole movie is about what it takes to become popular and how long can you keep your popularity. The fact that Cady becomes exactly the same thing that she takes down is not over done at all. There is a whole morality question at play as well. Do you give up your old friends for more popular ones? Do you become the one thing you hate to have it all? Thought provoking.A great movie and the only fault I can give it is that some of the situations (getting hit by a bus, moving from Afrca) are a bit contrived, but it's all ironed out.",Mean Girls
406,jobomojo56,Proper Jungle,10,17 December 2010,"After a hard day's graft consuming numerous dinosaur shaped processed food, one must nurture the painstaking desire for light humour, sharp wit and an ostentatiously callous yet endearing message of community and brotherhood... or perhaps I should say sisterhood?Yes the similar themes of the 'chick flick' are here, as are the stereotypes. You find your Heathers in similar situations, yet the dry, acerbic approach adopted by Tina Fey finds resonance within the most chauvinist of souls. Lindsay Lohan belies her current image as a Hollywood square and adopts the self-aware role of Kady with candour and vitriol.For me this film is like budget orangeade (Or orange soda as you Atlantic-savvy patrons may know). The film belies it's cheap, lacklustre exterior with a well crafted and utterly endearing taste that no person, whether their heart is made of grit or gold, can resist.",Mean Girls
407,RossNolan,Best Teen Movie since 'Clueless'?,8,21 June 2004,"I have to admit that despite being a straight, 22 year old guy I have always had a weakness for teen films so I was looking forward to Lindsay Lohan's (who really impressed me in 'Freaky Friday' and the much underrated 'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen') latest.It exceeded my expectations.Lindsay is on great form, instantly likable as Cady and believable both as a regular girl and a ""regulation hottie"". This girl is one of the best comic actresses of her generation and has created a fully rounded character it is difficult not to root for. Not that she carries the film alone.Of the adults Tim Meadows does sterling work in translating his character with relatively few lines. Neil Flynn (familiar as the Janitor from 'Scrubs') is even better with some great facial expressions as a father as much at sea in suburban America as his daughter. As for Tina Fey... a terrific performance of course and she is still as cute as she was on Saturday Night Live but where she really shines is in the screenplay which sounds real enough (at least for a teen film) and has some razor sharp areas (like Coach Carr's 'lessons').Of course the key group is the titular Mean Girls themselves - Regina (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) and Karen (Amanda Seyfried). Rachel McAdams creates a memorable High School tyrant, malicous, power mad and cruel but not entirely virtue free. She'd screw you over in a heartbeat if you stepped on her turf, but the nonthreatening Gretchen is allowed some reward for loyalty. Gretchen herself, played by the delectable Lacey Chabert is a character of her own, not just a cardboard minion to follow orders. Neurotic, shallow, desperate, beautiful, loyal and rather uncertain she is perhaps the saddest and most sympathetic of the Plastics - a girl who certainly has the looks and money to make it to the top of the pyramid but who lacked the will or the certainty. Not a problem with Karen (Amanda Seyfried) who has an admirable certainty of herself and her abilities. In one of the films best lines after a telling off from Regina, Cady tries to comfort her:Cady: You're not stupid, Karen. To which Karen replies thoughtfully (without a hint of bitterness or anger):Karen: No, I am, actually. I'm failing everything. Indeed she is. Karen is an airhead, and if not actively proud of it, at least accepting. She doesn't seem cruel herself, possibly because she is simply too shallow and dense, but she doesn't seem a bad person. Which for the second minion (Gretchen outranks her) to the villainous is quite a remarkable achievement.Finally I must mention Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese as Janice and Damian respectively, the outsiders we are rooting for, in theory. They do good work, though I found them slightly dry next to the endlessly dysfunctional Plastics (though that may be something to do with me finding Lacey Chabert much more attractive than Daniel Franzese!)Overall a very good piece of work from all concerned. If you like teen movies then you'll find this a very good one. If you don't, well hold your nose and try it anyway, you might be pleasantly surprised!",Mean Girls
408,mddavidson-268-869532,Entering girl world,10,30 January 2012,"Mean Girls is my favorite movie. It has the perfect combination of drama and humor. While entertaining us with funny quotes and quirky characters, it is able to show an audience an insight to the insanity and harshness of ""girl world"". One of my favorite things about the film is how I can watch it over and over again and catch something new almost every time. For example, in the scene where Gretchen listens in on Regina and Cady's phone conversation Regina cuts off a piece of bread. However, she then decides to eat everything except the small piece she cut off. This is done in order to show how much Regina has let herself go outside of eating the ""weight loss"" bars. I have watched this movie countless times and it took me forever to notice that. It is very subtle and hilarious. The movie is filled with all sorts of small things like that if you look for it. The movie also has a strong message that is conveyed through symbolism. It addresses the issues girls often face in high school in a real way. It is the only movie I have seen that does this. Every other high school movie is cliché, the acting is bad, the plot is unrealistic and lacks humor. The film's symbolism is addressed when Cady wins spring fling queen. She goes on to give a speech and says ""it's just plastic"" and goes on to break in. In turn, breaking up ""the plastics"" clique and showing everyone that ""being plastic"" is superficial and does not matter. I would recommend this movie to anyone 12 and up.

409,AJWittenburg,"decent, but that's all",4,24 May 2004,"the fact that this movie has received a seven average is somewhat discomforting. Although this movie had its humorous parts, this movie should not be considering even close to what is called a ""good"" movie. Having attractive girls prance around is definitely not something that i am against; however, this does not make for a good movie. There is few, if any, lines that take creativity to be funny. I'll admit that i laughed, but the jokes are not ones that i can tell to others or even watch again and laugh. if a 5 is average, i wonder, how can this movie receive a seven? This movie is better than most? It's a ""cute"" comedy, but nothing more. The movie's plot is boring and a comedy should have jokes that can at least be discussed after viewing; however, i am left with none. Give this a five at most, i would much rather watch American pie or even American pie two instead of this. I'll watch it again, but not to be amused but only to be a sexist pig and look at lindsay lohan and company.",Mean Girls

There were a few times when I genuinely laughed out loud because it was funny and not for any other reason. I loved how it's realistic enough to be true. Of course not anywhere near my high school... but I could see things happening like that in the States. They have way more schools... meaning way more opportunities. I think it's a good mother-daughter movie to see.I'd say it's a positive addition to Lindsay Lohan's filmography list.

I think it's even better when the ""nice girl"", wants nothing more in this world than to be liked by the ""populars"", and then she becomes an even bigger ""witch"", then they already are. Lindsay Lohan is a great actress, including Rachel Mcadams, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried. There is always, no matter where you go, at least a main clique of 3 or 4 girls who are the most popular or well-liked. I believe that the writers of this movie definitely hit their mark with a great ""clique"" movie. Not giving anything away, but the fact that the meanest girl becomes somewhat agreeable instead of staying with her ""bitchy"" state, I think that that makes for an even happier ending. Lindsay Lohan made a great ""nice girl"", but I do say that Rachel Mcadams made an even NICER one.",Mean Girls

I was excited to purchase her new movie ""Mean Girls"" on DVD with out even seeing it first. Her reputation proceeds her. Fun, Clean, Exciting, Funny, Smart, Musical, are just a few of the adjectives I could use to describe her in her other movies. So, needless to say that as my husband, daughter and my self sat down to watch this Lindsay Lohan movie, SHOCK! is the only thing I could think..... I can no longer trust in the judgment of this actor for a quality ""FAMILY MOVIE"". When a movie only teaches your children new and creative ways to say the nasty words that were in this movie just bothers me. This movie was portrayed a lot different on the TV ads than what we saw in our home. I got rid of the movie. I didn't even want it in my house. It really disappointed me. The dog chewing on the mothers nipple....WHY? Not funny, for a movie aimed at this age group. Don't get me wrong... I love a good mindless, slap stick movie. But the mix of Lindsay geared toward the Tween generation for her previous movies all the sudden jumping into this kind of movie and unwittingly taking a lot of innocent children and trusting parents with her down a dirty trail.

It shows exactly what happens in almost every school across the globe. The acting was fantastic. Lacey, Amanda, Lizzy, Jonathan, Rachel and Daniel were great. I even enjoyed Lindsay Lohan a little bit.

It uses very clever humour and a little slapstick, but not too much. It emphasises how backstabbing people can be, and who your real friends are. Unfortunately, you may find it very risqué, but, who cares? It's just some fun. I must admit, when my friends were going to sit down and watch this movie, I was more than a little apprehensive, but nevertheless, I sat down and watched it. Within 5 minutes I knew I wouldn't regret my choice.Maybe one of the reasons I like this movie was because I can relate to a lot of the topics brought up, or maybe the reason I liked it is because it's darn funny! In closing, I will certainly buy the DVD.

From the African bush to High School, this film shows how hard it is to fit in, and shows an everyday teen life. In a way, my school is like this one in the film! :D Once again, i loved it, and have now watched it 7 times in total. I saw it at the cinema twice, and once i got the DVD I've watched it 5 more times! I simply cannot get enough of this fantastic film. If you are a teen, then you've gotta see this! I, being a student, can also relate to this school as it has the everyday problems that teens have, and shows how bitchy girls can be. If you wanna be cheeky, it gives you ways on how to fight sneakily :P. This film truly shows girl world, from boys, to fashion, and to popularity. To be in the teen group 'The Plastics' is Teen Royalty, and every teen girl longs to be like them, from the popularity with the guys, the rest of the girls, and to be known by all the school students. I wish i could be like them, of course not as bitchy, because some of the things these girls do are just outta your mind! :D I truly loved this film, it has inspired me to be a teen actress (i wish i could be in the film!) to make sure i obey the rules of girl world, and i have been taught a valuable lesson: If you break the rules of girl world, it does pay!Hope my comment helped ya'll, i don't think i spoilt anything!-x-Sqeeky Deeky -x-",Mean Girls
419,RedGoldDragon23,Blatant Copy of a book meets an Unfunny Saturday Night Live episode.,6,1 June 2005,"For a topic so incredibly important in today's culture and society, it seems odd that ""Mean Girls"" is both a comedy and a drama on the subject. It tries to prove a point and make an important statement, but at the same time it's a parody so the lessons it gives fall flat and end up being run over by the banal jokes and overused ideas this film is.If you haven't read the book that this movie is based on, I suggest you do. Rosalind Wisemen's ""Queen Bees & Wannabes"" is a perceptive, beautiful and interesting achievement in teen psychology. This ""movie version"" is just pure cliché.The cast, for one thing, isn't all that great. Lindsay Lohan is just alright, hardly believable and generally irritating as the awkward, ""virgin"" of a high school protagonist who supposedly has no idea about kids her age or girls that are complete bitches. According to the film, she's lived and traveled in Africa her entire life and therefore knows nothing about American culture. ""I thought there was just fat and skinny,"" she says, observing the self-consciousness she sees her classmates facing.Is she serious? Is she that incredibly blind? How hard is it to pick up a magazine, or notice people or understand that body types come in all packages besides FAT and SKINNY alone? Has she honestly never had any of those feelings? How is ""I've lived in Africa"" a possible excuse for being that moronic? Still, when you get past the plot faults and the unfunny one-liners, the movie is a small gem in itself, right? After all, how often IS this topic parodied or discussed...and done with feeling and a little substance? The problem is that ""Mean Girls"" tries too hard. Way too hard. ""Close your eyes and raise your hand if you've said something behind a girl's back...now open them."" Shock. Surprise. D'uh.I saw the movie hoping that since it was supposed to hit on a hard subject with sincerity, it would address something a little more perceptive. It would have done so much better as just a comedy that didn't completely mirror Wiseman's book (most of the lines Lohan has are direct quotes that may pass over your head if you haven't read it). And what was up with Lohan getting the guy at the end? He was such a LOSER. And Regina didn't face any consequences for her constant harassment and disgusting teen sex life, she was just accepted as a ""regular person"" in the end. Where's the moral in that? What are we to learn from this? Nothing. So why, why why is this movie acclaimed as an ""eye-opener""? So, if you want a funny teen comedy that you can relate to and laugh at and then forget about....rent ""Mean Girls"". If you want something more poised, elegant yet gruesome and brutally honest, try ""Thirteen"". It does a MUCH better job.",Mean Girls

There are about 2-3 funny scenes, one of them will happen on Halloween. Ah. Halloween - I didn't mentioned it in the must-to-be ...

422,themessiah1988,Wow...this movie blew big time.,1,23 March 2006,"Recently, I just watched this movie in my high school and felt like I was being Chinese-water tortured. The most generalized statement that I can make about this movie is this: IT IS TERRIBLE!!!. But, since I am not the kind of person who just makes a generalized statement and leaves, I will elaborate on my belief. Mean Girls may represent a realistic school somewhere(Hell, perhaps) but in actuality no high school has people act as moronically outgoing in such vast masses as this movie. In a real high school(like the one I was sitting in while watching this piece of sh**), people are very laid-back and don't really care what other people think of them(at least not out loud like this movie portrayed 24/7). On the topic of cliques, yes there are definitely many in high school, but no one group of people honestly gives a flying fu** what another group of people thinks of them. Mean Girls seemed to possess a mentality of ""If someone calls you fat, you have the right to blow their head off"", which is not a realistic, general high school belief by any means. Another aspect of this movie that I thoroughly hate is its use of swear words. In an actual high school, people swear either because they are upset, it is part of their normal vocabulary, or because they have a somewhat legitimate reason for doing so. In Mean Girls, the swearing is so pointless, annoying and excessive that you just want to hurl all over those idiotic girls. Frankly, Mean Girls was extremely hard for me to sit through, and I actually felt obligated to look away most of the time because of the overwhelming amount of bullsh** on the screen. Well, that is about all of the reasons why this piece of crap movie sucks big time, and should never be seen by any sane human. The only reason why I am writing about this movie is because I want to get the message out on how bad it is, and because it just surpassed Dumb and Dumberer as being my least favorite movie ever. I am thoroughly upset at how this movie is getting such a high rating on IMDb, when it should definitely be taking it hard...very hard. I just hope that when most people saw this movie they were high on cocaine, so they might have actually enjoyed it and given it a better rating. All in all, if there really are people in the world like the majority of the characters in Mean Girls, I can then definitely see a reason for why the death penalty is still in effect.",Mean Girls
423,stuart_goodall,I am confused,3,18 March 2005,"Oh look. Another teen chick flick. Mean Girls starts off well. Lohan is likable enough, and pretty to look at which, lets face it, is going to keep the teenage boys who have taken their girlfriends to see it happy. The sub text of her naivety due to African home schooling seemed unnecessary. Being the new girl alone is reason enough for her to get into the situations she does. But aside from this, it starts off well. There are some nice gags, especially involving the maths team and there is the odd slice of adult humour. But what got to me was that the stereotypes that permeate the movie are knowingly sent up, but never really shattered. The film seems to nervously skirt the issue of whether it should destroy the clichés it projects, then wimps out at the last minute with a slushy ending. Watch American Pie or Bring it on. They seem less self conscious.",Mean Girls

I think she was really great in The Parent Trap. She was fairly good in Freaky Friday, but I just didn't like her character much.

All the characters are funny, entertaining and heartwarming in their own way with the actors playing their roles perfectly. Lindsay Lohan does a good job as Cady and I love Amanda Seyfried as Karen. Though I think the standout is Rachel McAdams. She plays Regina brilliantly and is very convincing as someone who can be charming, yet at the same time, down-right evil. For me, she is Regina and I can't picture anyone else in the role. The supporting cast is great too. With the characters of Janis, Damien and Gretchen being very natural in their roles. Another thing about this movie is its story. Thanks to the wonderful screenplay by Tina Fey, audiences of young and old can enjoy and appreciate its lighthearted humor despite it being labeled ""a teen movie"".

But I was sure that the modern classic Mean Girls would reach an 8? or even 8.5? I need to justify my 10/10 for this film. It has been over a decade since Mean Girls has come out which is long enough to see the impact that it has had on this (and my generation). I was 15 when this film graced the screens and at the time I thought it was intelligent and fun to watch. Good actors, good characters and a fantastic addition to the teen com genre. Up there with 10 Things I Hate About You and She's All That and Clueless.I would say that the film I would most compare it to would be Clueless. Mean Girls was to the 2000s what Clueless was to the 90s. So many of the witty one liners and vernacular used in Mean Girls I can see around me in the media today (what I like to call the 'Mean Girls Generation') how its phases have permeated popular culture. 'Stop trying to make....happen' or 'On Mondays, we wear ...' Its analysis of cliques and the well-written script has meant that it has stood the test of time. I can't rate it enough.

You would think that i am probably the only guy in this entire planet that likes this film but loads of my friends like it. Plus it has good actors, but it is nothing like i expected it to be. Me and my friends just rented this film because we thought it would be hilariously bad.

You have people that you think are your friends....when really they could be talking about you behind your back, or maybe even spreading rumors about. This movie will seriously make you wonder who your real friends are and why they are friends with you. Are they just using you, do they think of you as a threat so they keep you as a friend to make sure that you always stay under them....or do you two honestly have enough in common that you need to be friends. It'll make you question all your relationships. Because you never can know all the stuff that happens behind your back.

432,soccerswimmerguy,"Hilarious, fun, and something everyone can enjoy!",9,9 March 2018,"The movie ""Mean Girls"" (2004) is one that is memorable and makes everyone laugh. It is a comedy that especially attracts the younger crowd, but it is a movie that everyone from young to old can enjoy. It is about a girl from Africa named Cady Heron who comes to America for high school. She meets friends who are not popular and they tell her and warn her to not be friends with ""The Plastics"", who consist of three obnoxious, popular girls (Regina George, Gretchen, and Karen). However, she ends up becoming friends with them. Also, she becomes friends with a boy named Aaron in her math class. At first, Cady sees ""The Plastics"" as a nice, new group of friends but later finds out their true identity and the reason behind their name. Also, Cady is somewhat attracted to Aaron, who is also Regina's ex-boyfriend so this causes some tension. Everything turns out to be a disaster at the end because of all the drama between Regina and Cady. Cady gets in huge trouble and finally realizes that this is not what she is supposed to be like and that the ""friends"" she has been around have been a bad influence on her. She turns back to the old, lovable Cady that she was before getting involed with ""The Plastics"". The movie concludes with Cady being back with her original, nerdy group and ""The Plastics"" no longer being around because all three girls went in their own directions. I recommend everyone to watch this film because it is a classic teen drama/comedy movie that is hilarious to watch, and it can be watched over and over without getting boring. It will make you laugh the whole time because some of the things in the movie are super dumb and stupid that it's funny. Also, many high schoolers enjoy this movie because of the relatablity to their own high school life (drama, clicks, bulling, trying to fit in, etc). The actors in the movie are prominent actors in Hollywood. They include actors who have been in the entertainment industry for a while: Lindsay Lohan, Rachael McAdams, Jonathan Bennet, and Tiny Fey. Overall, this movie is one of my favorites because it is super funny to watch and always keeps you awake. Since I don't watch movies often, I fall asleep in them. So for me not to fall asleep proves how this movie must be a least a little interesting. This movie received mostly positive reviews, but there are a few negative reviews that criticize this movie. In May 2014, moonmonday wrote a negative review that claimed that Mean Girls is a try hard of other more successful teen movies such as ""Heathers"" (1988) and 'Jawbreaker"" (1999). However, ""Mean Girls"" is not comparable because the plot of all three movies are totally different. I searched up Heathers and Jawbreaker and both have someone being murdered or committing suicide. This might give way to why they are both rated R while ""Mean Girls"" is rated PG-13. I think that moonmonday is just being prejudiced and likes more inaprropriate movies. He/she also might like the two movies mentioned but others don't. Heathers has similar reviews to Mean Girls (~7.0/10 reviews on IMD). On the other hand, Jawbreaker has only 5.5/10. If you ask anyone if they heard of any of these three movies, the majority will say they heard of Mean Girls. Another point that this negative review claims is that it is mean to the openly gay student, Janis Ian, when the movie should support this minority. However, the final outcome is that the protagonist, Cady, becomes good friends with her. This inaccurate review of the 2004 movie ""Mean Girls"" just is one person who dislikes this movie and provides reasons why they think that this movie is worthy of 1/10 stars on IMD. But, this does not reflect the movie at all. It should have at least 9/10 stars because the movie provides the lesson of always being true to yourself and not caring about what others think of you. It has a unique storyline and is filled with great acting by greater actors. Mean Girls is a have to watch movie that you can watch with your friends and family anytime.",Mean Girls

Most guys I ask about this movie say thats not what girls are really like and I say well hang on a sec yes they are.

436,abe87,"Finally, A Teen Movie that Funny AND Smart!",8,18 February 2007,"Finally a ""teen movie"" that is funny AND intelligent! When I first saw the trailers and previews of Lindsay Lohan walking down the hallway and stumbling into a trash can, I was reluctant to see it since I thought it was going to be another crappy,shallow movie made for and aggressively marketed towards the teen demographic. Wow, was I surprised to see this movie be so much more than what the previews gave it credit for! The first thing that hits you is how well the screenplay is written by Tina Fey. The jokes are right on target by being funny, getting to the point, relevant, and smart (they aren't the dumb and obnoxious jokes in most teen movies).The characters are well-developed and aren't simply the clique caricatures we usually have to suffer through. Like Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) isn't just a flaky mean girl sidekick. There's some emotional depth to that character when she reveals how much she internalizes her feelings because that what a good friend does. Sure they are exaggerated at times, that's expected since it's a movie, but somehow Fey manages to keep it realistic where I could see this sort of thing happen in high school. And the clichés usually seen in teen movies like when the house party goes horribly wrong, gets trashed and the protagonist gets in major trouble are thankfully bypassed. The love story is also believable as Lohan deals with it as a normal teenager might; it's not completely awkward. When the 'boyfriend' and her have misunderstandings, they are plausible and the reactions are real enough to believe.Ultimately, there is real heart in this movie, it is deeper than I thought it would be (keeping in mind that it is still a teen movie). Cady (Lohan) kind of becomes what she was against without even knowing it before she owns up to it at the end and lessons are learned. The sappy happy ending isn't over the top and the point of the movie doesn't hit you over the head repeatedly. By the end of the movie, you really appreciate the wonderful performances (especially by Lohan--who is finally showing that she can be a promising actor by keeping Cady real and a strong center to the movie) that made all the characters likable and plausible to a certain extent. By no means is this movie perfect (it kind of loses steam and some directness three-quarters of the way through) but it's the best ""teen movie"" I've seen in a long time and could easily be seen in the same light as ""Clueless"" or ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High.""",Mean Girls
437,kjohnson-25888,Moral Review,8,18 June 2019,"The movie Mean Girls, released in 2004, is written by Tina Fey and directed by Mark Waters. While it was released 15 years ago, it still remains relevant today because the theme is relevant to each generation. No matter the decade there are mean girls who are at the top of the ""food chain"" and remain there by being unkind to others. The movie, Mean Girls, follows Cady, a sheltered home schooled girl from Africa, who is thrown into a typical American high school. At school Cady meets the queen bee, Regina George, and her possy the ""Plastics"". The movie chronicles Cady's experience with theses popular girls and highlights every unpopular teenage girl's dream of taking out the popular girl. While the movie delivers on this fantasy, to accept a particular moral message. The film teaches girls to fight mean girls with aggression. The writer/director use strategies to deliver their message. The average consumer may not be aware that they are being manipulated. However, with an understanding of these strategies the viewer can take a course of action to determine a better response to the moral message being directed at them. The writer and director use human nature to deliver their message but they could have used the opportunity to show teenage girls there is another and better way to manage difficult personalities in the social hierarchy of high school. The writer and director could have portrayed Cady as a girl who kills with kindness. But instead, Cady takes a page out of Regina's playbook in order to take out the popular girl which teaches girls to be mean.The film uses strategies to persuade the audience. The writers and directors use knowledge of human nature to draw the viewer in and persuade the viewer that unkindness should be countered with more unkindness. For example, It is human nature to both want to be a part of the popular group, and to want to take down the popular girls. Cady represents the general population of girls and their desires to take down the popular girl. The average girl isn't popular. She is not rich. She does not have a fancy car and fancy clothes. But it is every average girls dream to belong with the rich, beautiful popular girls. The writer and director use this natural human desire to draw the viewer in to the movie where Cady, a home schooled girl with no style, is drawn into the small circle of popular girls.It's also human nature to want the popular girls to suffer like the rest of the average population. In this movie Cady works hard and finds the solution to take down the popular girl. The average consumer might not notice that the film is playing to our natural human tendency to want the popular girl to suffer.Viewers are manipulated by movies like Mean Girls. First as a viewer it is important to recognize one's own human nature. Next one could identify alternative outcomes for some of the scenes in the movie. For example, Regina had gained some weight due to the Calteen bars that Cady had given her to eat. ""Sweatpants are the only thing that fit me right now,"" she confessed to her friends at lunch. This would have been a good opportunity for Cady to introduce kindness and empathy to girls who have never been kind or empathetic. Instead Cady and the plastics shun Regina because she broke the ""rules."" They treated Regina just as unkindly as she had treated them and others.Janis' reputation was ruined because of the rumors spread by Regina George. Janis has held onto this anger for years. When Cady s quickly been snatches up by the plastics Janis uses the opportunity to her advantage. With Cady's access to the plastics Janis has the opportunity to plan and plot and attempt to take down Regina. she tries multiple strategies to take her down. Some of the weapons include, using foot cream for face cream, cutting holes in her shirt, and finally tricking her into eating caltien bars which make her gain weight. Cady was a bridge between Janis and Regina and could have mended the friendship. Instead Cady lets Janis' ideas get the best of her and they consume themselves into the defeat of Regina George.
The movie manipulates us by using our acceptance of social norms. For example it's socially acceptable for girls to pretend that they are stupid to get help and attention from a boy. In the movie Cady pretends that she doesn't know how to do math to get Aaron's attention and ends up almost failing. Viewers should take this with a grain of salt and see that the writers and directors are using a social norm to push the story line of the movie.This popular movie manipulates the audience by capitalizing on our natural human tendencies. By recognizing our human nature we can overcome this by identifying alternative and healthier solutions.",Mean Girls
438,aadithigopalakrishnan,Evergreen Nostalgia,8,8 July 2019,"There's nothing extraordinary or mind blowing about this movie, but it's something I can always come back to to make me laugh.
Even though they overdid the whole ""Girl from Africa"" thing without even being specific about what country it was, it sets it apart from other chick flicks.
I can completely relate to how Cady feels about Aaron Samuels. Being foolishly and dazzlingly smitten to the point of failin math. She was literally losing her mind.
I wish they'd Amy Poehler more screen time because she is outrageously amazing.
I wish there had been a Mathletes at my school, I would have definitely joined and still been popular. So I absolutely love how she goes to spring fling wearing her mathlete jacket.
The best part of the movie is of course Regina George. No one else is worth hating life for.",Mean Girls

443,animeyusii,"Fun, nothing really intelligent, just mindless fun",7,8 February 2020,"I'm not that into high-school comedy, or high-school drama in general. The only real reason why I had watch this movie is because I listen to the songs from the musical and watched the animatics from Youtube and loved them all.With that say, when it ended, I found it as a good movie.Characters and Story:The main character isn't suppose to be a deep or complex character, she's the archetype of the new girl who is beautiful but clumsy, she has flaws but are not too much showed because that would make her less relatable...With that said, she isn't really a un-interesting character. The movie gave her own time to flesh she out and make her situation believable, making us actually care for her...That can be sayed for practically all the characters. They are archetypes, but the writing make them likable enough and adding a interesting character development.Sure, that does not mean is a great one and that all the characters are good only because are likable. Karen and Aaron could have had more time in screen, same with the parents and the teachers.But, least be honest, the movie depends more of his comedy and fast-pacing plot for elevate the entertainment values.The jokes are mostly fun, the plot follows the typical cliches for high-school movies but subvert them in a way that the movie would be funny.I like the way that the movie doesn't really idealized high school like most of his kind do...Of course, the movie isn't really developing any serious of realistic problem or matter, they just want to be as fun as possible.That's basically all I have to say about the. Characters and story, is a strong cast in a cliché but well executed high-school movie.Technic aspects:The movie is nicely filmed...The fotography is smooth, the make up and designs of costumes really smart and the acting particularly good.Overall, this is a nice, really fun to watch movie, the way is directed give it a warn tonality and the actors put all their hearts in their rolls.Sure, is not groundbreaking in terms of plot or characters, but it definitely deserves a try.Characters 7/10 (Good)
Story: 6/10 (fine)
Acting: 9/10 (great)
Technical aspects: 8/10 (pretty good)
Overall: 7/10 (Good)",Mean Girls
444,guitar_gurl22,Mean Girls is my favorite movie,10,3 November 2006,"It's a comedy on the outside but at the heart of it the movie Mean Girls is a close to true life portrayal of teenagers, cliques, and high school. The movie follows life of sixteen year old Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan). She is a normal teenager, except for the fact she has lived in Africa most of her life and has always been home schooled. Now, her family has moved to Illinois and she starts going to a public high school. You watch as she goes through the ups and downs of high trying to find her true self.Cady meets many of the average high school kids. The first friends she gains are Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian (Daniel Franzese). They are described as being the ""art freaks."" They are the true friends she gains throughout the movie. Her other ""friends"" are Regina (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen (Lacey Chabert), and Karen (Amanda Seyfried). They are commonly known as ""The Plastics."" They are the girls everyone loves because they are too afraid to hate them.After discovering Cady's connection to ""The Plastics,"" Janis decides to use it to her advantage. She recruits Cady to basically ruin Regina's life as revenge for a rumor Regina spread about her. Cady is hesitant at first but eventually agrees to it. Throughout a series of comedic events and ideal circumstances, they cause Regina to gain weight, and lose her friends, boyfriend, and popularity.I would recommend this movie to anyone who is or ever was a teenage girl. It is the perfect mixture of comedy and drama, well teenage drama at least. It does not go too far into this fantasy land that most comedies tend to find. It stays as true to life as a somewhat ""slapstick"" comedy can. If you want a good laugh and you want to watch something with meaning, this is the movie for you.",Mean Girls
445,andreius-2,Don't trust the rating of the movie,1,2 September 2006,"I usually put a faith in IMDb regarding the scores displayed but since I saw this movie I began seriously doubting them.The scene when the bus hits Regina is totally inappropriate. It's like the screenplay writer ran out of inspiration when he decided to add it.The Mathematics Contest is another good example for how inspired the screenplay writer was. As far as I recall, mathematics is based on judgment and logic not on remembering the content of the blackboard looking through a handsome guy. :) Lindsay Lohan did a decent acting by the way.I'm totally not recommending the movie unless you have a strange passion for the genre :)",Mean Girls
446,LuckyGreen18@yahoo.com,GREAT movie...not so big on the ending.,4,26 May 2004,"For most people, high school is Hell. The girls are usually worse than the guys. Yes, guys can be jerks, don't get me wrong, but girls will go out of their way to make every waking moment torturous for their prey. I loved how ""Mean Girls"" showed how cruel the ""plastics"" in high school really are, but they got the ending all wrong. We all WISH the real queen-bees of high school could get hit by a bus and realize their evil ways, but the fact of the matter is that things like that don't usually happen. Sure there are exceptions, but I knew the queen-bees in high school. They never changed. They stayed mean all through high school and out into the real world. I see them wandering around town years later and they're just as mean as they were back then. When they're mean in high school, they usually don't change. They end up marrying someone mean, having mean children, and then running the PTA. (No offense to anyone who's in the PTA). Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie. Especially how Lindsey Lohan was able to get out of the mean group. I just wasn't to crazy about the fantastical ending. Lindsey Lohan was able to get out because she hadn't been in it for very long, but for those who've made it in the plastic group all the way up until junior year, there's usually no hope for them.",Mean Girls
447,niiv50,A thought-provoking and truly original marshmallow-hearted masterpiece,10,26 December 2006,"This was a movie I didn't expect to like. I hadn't heard that much about it and wasn't all that enthusiastic about seeing another Lindsay Lohan movie. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.First of all, this movie is truly original. That's rare these days. It revolves around the premise that the longer we are around someone, the more they rub off on us to the point that we totally lose ourselves. In this case, the ""someone"" off of which to be rubbed are a trio known as the Plastics, played by Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried. There are interviews with the trio featured on this movie's DVD and was amazed at how accurate their American English tongues were. Very well done.And Lohan is brilliant. Her toned down, not over the top portrayal of Cady was delightful and wonderful. This is the first time I actually thought of Lohan as a very good performer. Both Lohan and McAdams deserve an Oscar for this film.In addition, the film is beautifully shot as well. This could have been a very goofy movie, with a premise that was hard to actually get into and believe, but this film worked perfectly on all accounts: writing, cinematography, acting. I would recommend this film to anyone that wants to see a thoroughly enjoyable, funny, sweet, interesting, wonderful film that is unlike any you've seen before.",Mean Girls

451,Selene377,Pretty good,7,19 December 2006,"Hi everybody. I've seen the movie and I have to say that it's not bad, although I think that the characters of the two friends of Regina (Rachel McAdams), I don't remember their names, are too stupid... I know that sometime it could be funny.. but it was exaggerated... But, in general, the movie is good, and it tells some things that are true in real life, because there is always a girl or a boy who rules in high-school or somewhere. Lindsay Lohan looks handsome in this movie and her role is interesting. To sum up, I think the movie is good, but not a perfect film. There are better films. I'm a Spanish girl, so I'm sorry if my English is not very good. Kisses from Spain.",Mean Girls
452,niiv1195,Lindsay Lohan stars in this highly memorable and highly enjoyable teen film.,10,26 December 2006,"This film is simply amazing. Please ignore any review of less than four stars. Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams are superbly cast in this brilliant love story. Director Mark Waters is nothing less than a genius in his treatment of this story by the great Tina Fey. Even though the premise is about a new technique to preserving and sharing one's past experiences with one another so that the speaker as well as the audience might benefit from them, mistakes or otherwise, the film resonates with reality. You will identify with the complexity of Cady (Lohan) and Regina's (McAdams) relationship, as well as that of her subordinates. The performers have a wonderful chemistry and convey their deep emotional attachment without a lot of sappy dialog. Lindsay Lohan has never been better. I realize that her hyperactive (sometimes maniacal) personality is what first garnered her fame but she really shines when she forces himself to reach inside for a quieter performance. There has been glimmers of this ability in a lot of his films  this lady needs to do more serious, dramatic work! This film is hard to categorize -- comedy, drama, dramedy? I just prefer to call it REAL. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry but best of all it will make you think. If you enjoy intelligent, well-crafted cinema run, don't walk, and see this film. I will treasure my copy and I will recommend it to everyone!",Mean Girls
453,niiv1196,Highly Recommended,10,26 December 2006,"This movie has the sophistication most modern day movies lack. It isn't your typical love story because you really don't know if they were meant for each other. In this movie, it simply doesn't matter. The concept that some former reviewers cannot grasp is the fact that this movie isn't simply about two people who are in love but how painful love can be and how that pain builds a person, and how another person can totally screw up things thus building up the aforementioned pain. Lindsay's character grows from his relationship and reliving those memories puts her back at the beginning. The interesting concept about this movie is how the thought that maybe people aren't destined to meet their one and only, but instead love is clumsy and we stumble into someone and then fall in love......and then fall back out. If one can't focus enough time for those two characters then apparently he or she should go back to the cheap action flicks. If you want something little less mainstream, then I strongly recommend this movie. It is worth every penny.",Mean Girls
454,niiv1197,Groovy + Cool = Grool = This Movie,10,26 December 2006,"With that out of they way, I still didn't respond much to McAdams, but I thought Lohan did a fine job...understated, lonely, lost. Tina Fey, Tim Meadows, and Lacey Chabert are always first rate in what they do, and they were first rate here.The movie itself was clever by half, but with so much more heart than Tina Fey usually shows. The whole thing of being so changed by past experiences and hopes that you want out is a powerful plot device. And I think Lohan's performance hit the bulls eye. Swinging back and forth in time, going back and forth between memories and reality (as heard through the voice-over), had me quickly paying attention to what was going on. I really like a movie that poses puzzles, with issues that can be figured out only if you don't doze off...and where the writer and director play fair with the audience. Memento and Usual Suspects also come to mind as good examples of this.",Mean Girls
455,niiv1198,Great narration,10,26 December 2006,"While there's nothing particularly novel in the way of direction, there is a world of technique in Fey's telling of this story. Because most of the story is told after Cady's North Shore days, the visuals are subject to her ability to recall them, which leads to many artful techniques, including an impressive scene using forced split screens. The narration is fairly standard. Perhaps Waters did this on purpose to make Cady's stories distinguishable from what's really happening in the outside world, but these sessions are for the most part very simple, yet quite as vocally appealing. With the compelling acting and writing, however, one rarely notices the narration except when it does become vocally apparent, which works out to the story's advantage. You don't have to worry too much about focusing on the wrong thing and missing a detail.",Mean Girls
456,niiv1199,Interesting film,10,26 December 2006,"Another idea that is misleading at face value is that this film is a teen flick about recollection preservation. While the writing does retain a slight resemblance to the importance of our ability to remember specific details about our a year in our lives that really stood out to us, Fey's choice to make the stories being told, and then preserved so that those of a loved one, or the audience will have much more of a common love story than a potent general fiction story -- Just about everyone who's been in a relationship that ended poorly has wanted to start over, and sometimes, not necessarily with the same clan. This film explores that topic to a believable extreme, and at no point should the fiction hater feel oppressed by the terminology involved. The main story of Cady Heron is enhanced with a superbly woven subplot involving the team that aids Cady throughout her journey, which merges with the main plot and contributes to the film's satisfying ending. Rarely does one find writing that is both intelligent and engaging without leaving a certain contingent of its audience behind. This film appeals to both the general-fiction minded as well as those looking for a satisfying love story.",Mean Girls
457,niiv1200,"Wow. Amazingly poignant, beautiful story.",10,26 December 2006,"This movie blew me away. It's one of those rare gems that take you by surprise when you think Hollywood can only produce the blockbuster or the over marketed piece of trash. It's an interesting dance between love story and general fiction. Lindsay Lohan is brilliant with her ability to blend her character's pretentiousness with her puppy dog like meekness. Her love for Jonathan Bennett's character is totally believable, and you desperately don't want her loses him. Bennett is outstanding as always. She plays her role beautifully as the attractive yet troubled eccentric. In the beginning, their relationship seems to be a quagmire, the kind so wrought with difficulties that it is certain to fail. But as we listen through Lindsay Lohan's characters narration, we see that there is much more to it. We see that relationships are made up of many ups and downs, likes and dislikes that love is not perfect, but it does not have to be.",Mean Girls
458,niiv1201,Absolutely brilliant,10,26 December 2006,"There are so many things that stand out in this film that it is hard to decide where to begin. Tina Fey has again come up with a very original and intellectual script based on the inner workings of the social milieu. The loops and circles of the story are wonderfully constructed and laid out in such a way to allow a very mysterious plot, and yet is not completely confusing. Mark Waters did an amazing job of directing this film, taking a very challenging script that could easily have been botched into a muddy mishmash of confusion. Instead, he weaves it together brilliantly, using fascinating effects, subtle visuals that allow new things to be discovered through every viewing, and symbolism that will keep your mind chewing for days.Lindsay Lohan has successfully proved that she is more than just a comical genius. Her portrayal of Cady Heron is very human and consistently believable and heartfelt. She has finally been able to play a dramatic character and completely leave out any hints of her outrageous comic characters. For her, I believe this is a spectacular performance.This is a very well constructed, thought-provoking teen fiction movie that hearkens back to the original concepts. It approaches the questions of humanity and fate with a new and original spin. Tina Fey is truly one of the great writers of our time. I also highly recommend other works by this writer. I can not wait to see what her mind comes up with next.",Mean Girls
459,niiv1202,Watch this movie at least three times before you judge it,10,26 December 2006,"The first time I saw Mean Girls, I knew it was something truly special. First, the opening sequence got my attention. I thought, ""What kind of crazy neighborhood is this"" as Cady Heron almost gets run over by the bus. What a delightful surprise to learn later that I had already seen the plot twist I had wished for during the middle of the movie. The last scene was truly supercharged. By then, of course, you love the characters and desperately wanted the relationship to succeed. By the second viewing, I began to notice more and more details, appreciate the beautiful musical score, the complexity and humanity of the plot. The emotional impact, if anything, was greater the second time because I better understood the relationships in this complex story. During the third viewing the dramatic tie in of the beginning and ending really hit home. Small details became clear which made them even more delightful. In short, by the third viewing you begin to appreciate the richness and genius of the details. The ending, of course, is quite remarkable. The emotional response actual increases with each viewing. You hear and understand what Cady is saying throughout the narration. You understand the importance to the plot of Lacey Chabert's character. The great acting ability demonstrated by Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams during this film made these characters seem real. These truly were the performances of a lifetime for all members of the cast and crew.",Mean Girls
460,niiv1203,Powerful reminder of what love/friendship really mean,10,26 December 2006,"Lindsay Lohan plays a heartbroken lady so desperate to numb himself from the pain of her lost love that she's willing to subject herself to a total personality transplant. The transplant requires an invasiveness that can be analogous to advertising and all the other consumer addictions we have at our fingertips in order that we may vanish ourselves from life's despair. But the transplantinvolving sabotage, espionage, trickery, and backstabbing, must be confronted by Lohan's need to re-awaken her love with her would-be boyfriend played wonderfully by Jonathan Bennett. It turns funny, tender, and postmodern, Mean Girls is journey into a young lady's scared, sensitive soul who must resist all the temptations of numbness that our social society has to offer us and, heroically find a love that defines and preserves her humanity.A rich, moving tapestry that reflects how we remember our own lives, this film is as powerful as it is delicate, and as wistful as it is romantic and strong. Lohan gives the performance of her life, and McAdams is utterly believable, beautiful, and paradoxically earthy and flighty. But curiously it is Chabert in her supporting role who makes the point we all will remember.I simply couldn't recommend this film more highly for anyone who loves or dreams of love--i.e., everyone.",Mean Girls
461,niiv1204,'Mean Girls' totally rocks!!!!,10,26 December 2006,"Perhaps the average person will most likely miss the surreal nature of this film. It is so nice to see something so unconventional make the major cinema though. Like many of Fey's SNL episodes, there is a dream-like quality to this story. While Lindsay Lohan's character shares her memories, Fey paints a picture of, at first, a spiteful group of young ladies with nothing but bitterness towards each-other to then, a pair of misunderstood individuals with relationships that are both sad, and yet wonderful. The story of Cady and Regina is presented from end to beginning, which seemed to confuse people. But honestly, if you can not get past that, you are not going to understand this movie at all. If you follow the flow of this film and let it take you away, it will do just that, take you away. I was so sucked in, that, near the end I found myself trying to hold on to Cady's recollections with her. If you are new to Mark Water's style or any film that has not been done in a traditional sense, then again, this one is not for you. I suggest you have a go at this film. It is full of eye candy and you will see something new every time you watch it.This is my favorite movie of 2004. This is a movie that will remind you why you still watch movies. If you haven't seen it yet, then go buy it and watch it over and over.",Mean Girls
462,niiv1205,Unforgettable,10,26 December 2006,"Lindsay Lohan, in her best role yet, plays Cady Heron, a quiet, unassuming young lady who falls in love with a student Senior Aaron (Jonathan Bennett), a high-energy, righteous young man that couldn't be more her polar opposite. As Cady tries to score points with him, a friend of hers named Regina decides to beat her to it by hooking herself up with him before it is too late.To say more about the plot would be difficult... and improper. Suffice it to say that this movie works because Cady's walk down memory lane is a familiar stroll for us all. Stylistically, the film is not an assault on the senses, with constant and sometimes subtle visual effects enhancing the alternate reality of events remembered. The film is funny at times, but more often, it is achingly tender, and other times pathetically desperate. There is a brilliant subtext of emotion woven into the story, the cinematography, and the performances.",Mean Girls
463,niiv1206,Fey's masterpiece deserves better than this.,10,26 December 2006,"I watched this film because someone I barely know saw it and told me that it's her favorite movie of all time. Whenever someone says anything is their absolute favorite anything, it's usually something that should be looked into. So I rented the DVD and now of course I own it because this IS a great movie.What I mostly like about Mean Girls is that it's not so idealistic like all the other movies out there. Most films end when the relationship in question is just beginning, but this one actually shows you the ups, downs, and in-betweens. I think that's really important. So many people today who are trying to meet someone think that everything is supposed to end up like it does in almost every movie you see. That happily ever after jazz is thrown out the window in this film.The camera work, effects, and music are all really well-done, too. I like that it's a little weird and complicated. It's one of those that you really have to see multiple times to truly appreciate. As for the acting, I think Lindsay Lohan did the best job of anyone. She nailed that mopey, slightly boring character. I never thought for one minute that Rachel McAdams's character could have been portrayed better by anyone else. Maybe that's just because McAdams seems so proper with all those other films she's been in and all.I'd recommend Mean Girls to anyone, except maybe people who like happily ever after female-targeted films and don't like things they can't fully understand right away.",Mean Girls
464,niiv1207,"Great movie, awesome presentation",10,26 December 2006,"Seriously, this movie is wonderful. It examines many of the truths in relationships, such as how the things that draw us to a person end up driving us crazy eventually and how we're often attracted to people who have the qualities in abundance that we lack. The movie also examines the complexity of memory and how we as humans naturally seek out relationships that challenge us and help us grow, which is why the characters with certain memories are preserved by choice seem doomed to learn the same lessons they just learned all over again.The acting and the way this film is designed is beyond amazing. Both Lindsay Lohan, as Cady, and Rachel McAdams as Regina gave incredible performances. I really loved this movie and the messages it conveys. Cady and Regina were complex and complicated people and the writing, directing, and producing was an example of a collection of creative geniuses in full force.",Mean Girls
465,niiv1208,"Wow, Simply Wow",10,26 December 2006,"Wow. Lindsay Lohan shows a facet in this movie you would never dream she possessed. What would even make anyone ever look at him for the part of a quiet introvert is beyond me; I'm simply glad someone did. She is incredibly believable as the quiet young lady. Lindsay Lohan who is famous for her over the top facial expressions and wild physical gyrations. The movie would be worth seeing just for sheer amazement in that category. But........On top of Lindsay Lohan's surprise performance you have Rachel McAdams not stealing the scene but having an awesome presence. And then there's the bit players, if you could call Tina Fey and Tim Meadows bit players. The supporting cast in this movie is excellent. There isn't a weak element anywhere.Then we come to plot. Top notch. I wouldn't call the ending a surprise ending, although some people might not see it coming, but it is a hopeful ending. The movie leaves you with a great feeling. The feeling that we are something more than our experiences and our mind. That certain things are destined to turn out for the best no matter what. It makes you think of all your past relationships, good and bad, and truly wonder if the bad was worth it for those few instances of perfection that we see in almost every relationship.I don't see how anyone could not enjoy this movie.",Mean Girls

It is a heavy script with multiple meanings, and one can examine it on several different levels. The power, inconsistency, and unreliability of memory, the psychological and philosophical reality of memory, the brilliant, discontinuous script, the dynamic direction, the able and highly competent acting. How the resilience of human personality is greater than discrete collections of memory instances. And no matter how or what you may try, it is neither possible nor wise to completely change any significant and remembered instance of human experience, especially in love. However, it is possible to learn from it.The film makes you think and makes you cry at the same time. Powerful and brilliant. I can't recommend it enough.",Mean Girls
467,niiv1210,Mean Girls: The most underrated film in the history of Hollywood,10,26 December 2006,"After eighty years of cinema, the film industry is running out of original ideas. There seem to be more and more remakes of old films, or recycled ideas, everyday. I find this loss of originality to be quite depressing. That's why I'm overjoyed to find that there is still some creativity in Hollywood today. ""Mean Girls"" is a perfect example.Tina Fey is one of Hollywood's most important writers, and certainly one of its best living screenwriters. Before bringing us ""Mean Girls"", she's written such greats as the ""Saturday Night Live"" episodes of 2004/2005. Thanks to Ms. Fey, I feel happy knowing that there is still such a thing as an intelligent script nowadays.One of the things that leads this movie is the cast. If ever I had any doubts about Lindsay Lohan's acting talents, they were cleared up after this movie. Ms. Lohan is excellent, and thanks to her performance I really sympathized with her character. Rachel McAdams is also terrific. These two are both equally deserving of an Academy Award nomination. Tina Fey, Tim Meadows, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried play in supporting roles.At the director's helm is Mark Waters, and he knows how to steer this ship. The background music really adds to the film.I am proud to declare ""Mean Girls"" as my pick for the best film of 2004. This is one of the greatest films of recent years, and in my opinion one of the best films made. ""Mean Girls"" truly is an impeccable film.",Mean Girls
468,niiv1211,I recommend it everywhere.,10,26 December 2006,"Mean Girls is simply a fantastic film. It is smart, compelling, interesting, and deeply emotive. It is brilliantly put together and has a richness of texture that can only be appreciated on multiple viewings.It is a love story told in a semi-familiar way - reminiscence. The pain of a just-ended-before-it-began relationship with Aaron Samuels leads Cady Heron to choose a method unfamiliar to her in order to ameliorate her despair  take the queen bee down from her throne via a systematic means of payback involving the manipulation of three variables. It sounds strange because it is.The story continues on with Lohan's character reliving the memories of this young man while she shares them with the audience. She is telling her tale through a voice-over while discovering a powerful human lesson about life and love. The acting is absolutely superb, as it boasts an amazing cast of Fey, Lohan (a brilliant performance that surprised me), McAdams , Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried, and Lizzy Caplan. All of them are extraordinary.",Mean Girls
469,niiv1212,One of the Top Ten Films of 2004,10,26 December 2006,"What a fantastic film. I was so surprised at the emotion the Lindsay Lohan draws from you during this film. The story revolves are Lohan's character going through a series of flashbacks regarding her Junior year of high school. During the reversed time line, she makes observations and points out things that may be unclear to the audience. What ensues is a very touching attempt by Lohan's character to save any chances she might have with her classroom crush, which is ultimately thwarted by her ""friend,"" the same one had formerly gone out with this individual during the previous summer. The screenplay is by Tina Fey, and she delivers her usual quirky high quality tale. The story is beautifully told and the performers portray their characters with such realism that you really get taken for an emotional ride.I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys films that are considered good for their writing and acting, not for big budget and effects.",Mean Girls
470,niiv1213,The most wonderful movie that was ever made,10,26 December 2006,"The director takes an innovative twist on how he conveys the dream world. Images become faded and indistinct. Sound crackles in and then whispers away. Some scenes appear to be lit exclusively by a flashlight, perfectly representing the selective stanzas of Cady's thoughts. Other scenes are shown in distinct colors of green and blue. Still other scenes are nightmarish-purple and green.Ultimately, it's Tina Fey's writing that perfectly blends what could be a horrible mess. Just when you think all the various plot line could not possibly be resolved...we're back at that front school lawn with the buses in the street, and the thrill and awkwardness of that first attraction.",Mean Girls
471,niiv2075,This Is The Best Film That Was Ever Made,10,7 January 2007,"From the first frame of ""Mean Girls"" you know you are about to watch something special. There is not a moment in the film where you will find yourself bored or overwhelmed. It is perfect in every way. I have seen many films in my time and I am only 17. I have an extensive collection of over 180 DVDs and this is by far my most prized. I saw this film for the first time exactly one year ago and purchased this Special Collector's Edition the day it came out. Not a day goes by when this film does not pop into my mind.There are many movies but very few great films. The few include Gone With the Wind, Wizard of Oz, Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's List, The Godfather, and, of course, the rarely seen Imitation of Life. This is at the head of those. It is at the head of all films.In this film, the two main characters, played exquisitely by Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams are competing for the heart of a very handsome young man, who happens to be a Senior, whilst these two are Juniors. In fact, Lohan's character, Cady Heron, regrets it the most and most of the film is her own intense journey to go back and reflect upon her journey as a High School Junior which chronicles these and other events.The DVD transfer is nothing short of miraculous. Even the mono soundtrack sounds breathtaking. The DVD does not shy away from some amazing special features. I don't want to spoil them but anyone will find them interesting. I promise you this is one of the finest DVD packages on the market.",Mean Girls
472,niiv2076,It's wonderful.,10,7 January 2007,"Lindsay Lohan in this film made her mark as a screen icon with her multifaceted portrayal of Cady. Her fresh face and world-weary eyes fill the screen with full star wattage. She is the commanding center around which all the other characters revolve. It is impossible to imagine anyone else in this role. But there were a few other contenders. Thank goodness or at least Susan Shopmaker that they went with Lindsay in the process made her a star.Rachel McAdams is compelling and beautiful in her anti Hollywood post-90's glamor. She is so natural in the role of Regina that she draws you into the world of the film with her tender and desperate performance. When the camera holds her lovely face in full frame, is there a more beautiful face in the entire world? Lacey Chabert as Gretchen the rich Plastic takes a thankless sidekick and fills her with humanity and warmth. The delicious Tina Fey sparkles with wit and chicanery in her role as the Calculus instructor Sharon Norbury. It is pure joy to watch this, one of Hollywood's greatest character thespians in their most worthwhile roles. The cast is rounded out by a who's who of the A-1 character thespians; Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, and Tina Fey top this list. The biggest star of the film is the script by Tina Fey. It is tight, razor sharp and witty. The script of any film is its foundation. Without the writers you have nothing. With MEAN GIRLS you get a perfect film script. The direction by Mark Waters is among his best work. The music by Rolfe Kent is top-notch example of film music from the ages. There is a great deal of rousing songs to be found here. The films most famous song is of course the One Way or Another.",Mean Girls
473,niiv2077,"Why isn't this movie on IMDb's Top 250 list again, and in the Top 10????",10,7 January 2007,"I can't begin to explain how amazing this movie is, but I'll just start with Lindsay Lohan and the great Jonathan Bennett. These two give the greatest of their careers and quite possibly have the best chemistry of all time. One can even sense real love for each other. This is simply a tale of two separated lovers meeting again, and much more. The supporting cast does many great performances as well and the screenplay contains more legendary quotes than all the presidents and Gone With The Wind combined.As time goes by, Mean Girls is a film that will never die. It is my favorite film of all time. Everything about this film is wonderful. The set, the drama, the acting, the music, and the cinematography all whisk you away to another era. The film has everything a moviegoer wants. It has action, mystery, drama, romance, and at times it is even funny. Lindsay Lohan and Jonathan Bennett were the only ones I think that could play these roles right. They were a match made in heaven. They are probably a better on screen couple than Vivian Leigh and Clark gable. This is a timeless piece of film that everybody should see.The Verdict: I know this review was pretty short, but there's nothing else to say except for one thing: It's A Classic! And yes, I know it's a cliché to label any enjoyable movie a classic, as very few actually deserve to be called that, but I'm not just saying that because the movie is enjoyable; I am saying that because it is actually true. Recommended: Yes",Mean Girls
474,niiv2078,Fey is the master.,10,7 January 2007,"""Mean Girls"" is much more of a love story than anything Fey has written before, even with the writer's twisted view. The story is taken from Rosalind Wiseman's book ""Queen Bees & Wanna Bees,"" and the story is of Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), who discovers that her friend, Regina George (Rachel McAdams) has stolen her boyfriend-about-to-be. After going through brief periods of disbelief and outrage, Cady consults two good friends of hers, Janis and Damian and tells them what happened and together, the three of them go after Regina.To say more would spoil the joy in this movie, but I fear that I have not said enough and it is nearly impossible to capture the heart and grace of this movie in words written more than 2 years after it was first released. I also have not mentioned Lacey Chabert (Gretchen Weiners), one of the great characters in film history, even more so than Janis or Damien. I truly believe that this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and that being the case I am not sure how to adequately describe this great film. Suffice it to say that from the acting, to the script, to the performers, to the direction, and cinematography, I find it exceedingly difficult to find a flaw through this movie. It is just as vibrant a picture as it was 2 years ago.",Mean Girls
475,niiv2079,Best Movie Ever????????,10,7 January 2007,"I for one am shocked my parents let me get all the way to college before I saw this film. It is so good and so fun on so many levels that it should be with us as long as the technology exists to preserve it.Recently, I was in the Grand Canyon of Arizona and as I was leaving Phoenix, my friend the resident pianist played my favourite song for me and it made my day. It was ""Overdrive"" from Mean Girls. This song like the movie lives forever in the hall of the immortals.Who would like it? Good Lord, who wouldn't? And the humor does occasionally angle toward the feminine viewpoint. But even so, the famously ""tough"" Lindsay Lohan gets to be an external conflict protagonist and sensitive romantic lead all in one.This is the way Hollywood movies should be (and all too often are not) made.",Mean Girls

I'm a huge fan of new movies, but there are no better romances out there, and these stars made other films. Still, it's withstood the test of time gone by, so it's hardly surprising that Paramount released a special collector's edition.What is surprising is my appreciation for the film. It looks and sounds wonderful, and features a highly comprehensive package, including two solid commentaries by Rosalind Wiseman, Tina Fey, et al.The disc is splendid, with over ten minutes of deleted footage and a blooper reel, not to mention documentaries, press materials, photographs, etc. Other highlights include a theatrical trailer, interstitials, and optional commentary.Truthfully, I was blown away by the release of ""Mean Girls.""

477,niiv2081,"Great message, an unbelievably beautiful presentation, and the nicest movie ever made.",10,7 January 2007,"""Mean Girls"" is a great movie classic for many audiences to enjoy. This was filmed and written beautifully. This highly original plot has influenced many movies filmed after this, and it remains ahead of its time. The acting from all the performers is marvelous. Lohan, previously known as the drama queen, wonderfully transforms herself into a more sensitive being for her role. Though a lot of drama still lingers, the change is very noticeable. McAdams beautifully portrays her sense of danger and love in one of her best roles in her career. All other thespians, major or minor, also perform wonderfully. ""Mean Girls"" proves that it will remain a classic for many more years. It is sure to please audience of all kinds.Now it is available in a presented edition that surpasses all expectations. The film fairly glows with a pearly sheen and the sound is superb. I was struck not only by previously invisible details, like the texture of the fabric of the costumes, but by subtleties of expression in the voices and faces of the performers. These lend the drama a depth I had never seen in all my many previous viewings.Highly recommended! If you buy only one DVD of a classic film then this should be the one. (After seeing it, you'll want more!) All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.",Mean Girls
478,niiv2082,"This movie is really, really C-U-T-E !!!!",10,7 January 2007,"MEAN GIRLS features superb casting (Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried, etc.), an old love affair rekindled, the threat of a takeover, it's all here. Lohan plays Cady, a previously home schooled student from across the world. Regina and Aaron met and loved earlier, and now she turns up with her previous significant other the purpose of which is to prevent Cady from having a chance with him. The plot thickens and gets murkier and deeper - and Lohan plays the Martian, honorable in the end. One of her best roles. In fact, one of the best roles ever played by any of the thespians. If you've never seen it, then do it now. Oh, and one last thing: Since there are so many comments about the storyline and acting, I will just add a few words of praise for the technical quality of the DVD.This film has been wonderfully presented. The transfer is virtually flawless. The picture is crisp and clean and in perfect focus. What an enjoyment to watch such a great classic in pristine condition.",Mean Girls
479,niiv2083,Mean Girls: A Film for the Ages (10 + stars),10,7 January 2007,"The magic of ""Mean Girls"" lies mostly in its romance. Lindsay Lohan and Jonathan Bennett movie pairing remained their sole and maybe that's the reason why their unimpeachable chemistry became unique. Their fate as star-crossed lovers trapped in North Shore went down as one of the most memorable. And McAdams? She's one of the most beautiful and best performers ever to grace the screen, to say the least.There are many details in the movie that get it all just right. Whether it is the young couple, the Plastics or other things you may not notice at first viewing but that justify the purchase of the DVD, as you can get back to your favorite scenes again and again, as I do. Besides, the DVD has a stunning picture quality.The bottom line: with ""Mean Girls"" you get two of its most beloved stars in a marvelous coupling. These assets are far outweighing the occasional slow pace and datedness of the movie. Yes, ""Mean Girls"" is, has been, and always will remain a film for the ages.",Mean Girls

Beyond great.",10,7 January 2007,"All the characters and performers are wonderful, with McAdams at her best, Lindsay Lohan at her loveliest, Lacey Chabert at her most dapper as Gretchen, and Amanda Seyfried pulling in another hammy role as Karen.The overall pacing of the film strikes a fine balance between character development and suspense, as it is not too long and does not lose its way, thanks to a total lack of extraneous subplots, which often hinders lesser films. Lohan's Cady is the most interesting character as she exhibits a number of traits and transformations that are paralleled in the real world, from her personal loss of a great love to apathy for a higher cause to a metamorphosis resulting in self-sacrifice that spurs others to respond in kind against evil. Throw in numerous memorable lines, some fine acting, lots of partying that is appropriate for the circumstances rather than overdone, and some resented Plastics, and you have the makings of a timeless, atmospheric film.I've seen this many times and enjoyed it more every time. What do I do when I'm in the mood for this? I play it some more.",Mean Girls
481,sean229,number 2 please!,10,20 January 2007,personally i think that this has got to be one of the best movies ever made for teenagers :) it has to be the most bitchiest and sneakiest one 2. i love how it represents the lives of young girls in America..well not just America all over the world. i feel that Regina is portrayed ace and my favourite character has definitely got to be Gretchen. the dance sequence is funny and it made me laugh especially when Gretchen smacks it into Jason. also the whole meeting the plastics...OMG i love your bracelet where did u get it?? haha its class n shows the two faced side that everybody has! yes i know the plastics spilt up but there should so be a mean girls 2 where 2 schools's groups of mean girls go to college n totally BITCH there. i feel there should be a bitchy gay guy in one of the gangs or something as this would be funnier! consider this people! ah-ah,Mean Girls
482,clearyerin,Hilarious and Relatable,10,29 September 2021,"The film Mean Girls is a comedy about the cliques and struggles of teenage girls in high school. When new girl Cady moves from South Africa to America, she is in for a massive culture shock. She was previously homeschooled in Africa, but now that she has moved to America she has to start going to a public high school. She enters high school with a very innocent opinion of everyone, and she just wants to fit in. She meets the odd girl out, Janis the same day she meets the most popular girl in the school, Regina George. She sees two very different sides of the school through both of these girls. Through them she learns all about the cliques in the school and just how catty teenage girls can be. This is something she only ever experienced with the animals back in Africa. This film follows Cady as she gets intertwined with the popular group nicknamed ""the Plastics"". This group is admired by everyone in the school, but she soon realizes that this clique may not be as glamorized as she originally thought. The film follows her journey as she navigates her new clique and realizes just how mean high school girls can be.Mean Girls was released back in 2004, and it is still just as popular, if not more, now than it was 17 years ago. It has a cult following and even a day in October that it is celebrated by fans who wear the color pink to commemorate it. This film brought in over 100 million dollars in revenue, which goes to show its popularity. I am a huge fan of this movie and think that there are many aspects of it that led to the growth of its fan base. This film shows teenage life in an exaggerated way which makes it more comedic. I enjoyed how teenage girls or anyone that has been a teenage girl can relate to this film even though it is exaggerated. It shows many true aspects of public high schools. This includes the fact that the film describes and shows the many cliques that are in this public high school. Although cliques are very common in many high schools, they're usually not as specific as they explain them in Mean Girls. The way they portray stereotypes in this film is so brilliantly exaggerated to make it funny. The mathletes group is all boys and seen as ""social suicide"" just because someone likes math. The Asian girls all speak a different language and hangout together. The popular girls are all rich, skinny and idolized by everyone else. I think this is so funny because it makes fun of all of these stereotypes and more throughout the movie.Another aspect of this film that helped with its comedic effect was the acting. Amanda Seyfried, who played Karen, really embodied the ""dumb blonde"" role that she played. Karen's input always made situations funnier, but it wasn't just the words that she said, it was the entire way that she said it and acted in each scene. Lindsey Lohan, who played Cady Heron, was also a huge reason why this movie is as good as it is. She displayed a wide variety of acting skills throughout the film as Cady's character changed. She was able to display how dynamic the character of Cady was from the beginning, to middle, up to the very end of the film. There were also many memorable quotes in this film that are so out of the box that they are funny. These include quotes about sex and STDs which are topics that seem taboo but are explored in a comedic light for this film.An aspect that I believe made this film so great back in 2004 and still now 17 years later is that it is narrated by only one character. The film itself is about many different characters, but Cady narrates throughout the film. This makes this film seem like more of a first person recount of the events of the movie. It allows us to get insight into not only what is going on, but Cady's emotions behind the scenes. Similar to this, there are some scenes where it is filmed as if someone is making a documentary about the school and the events. There are a few scenes where students from the school are being interviewed, specifically about Regina George.This lets us know how students feel about Regina, and also gives us a different view of the school that we don't get from the normal scenes or Cady's narration.Another great aspect of this film is how they relate different scenes throughout the film. There is a scene in the beginning of the film where Cady views all of the chaos between girls at the school as animals fighting. This relates back to her life in Africa and what she experienced there, which is another thing I enjoyed about it. Later on in the film, after more things happen, we see a similar scene again with even more chaos between girls in the school being related back to animals fighting. Another scene is shown in the beginning of the film with the ""Plastics"" group walking all together. This scene is related back to through very similar scenes two more times later on in the middle and very end of this film which I really enjoyed.The final aspect that made this movie what it was for me was that the relatable high school topics that I mentioned earlier in this film are all made fun of and kind of debunked throughout this film. The film looks into the funny aspects of sex education, cliques, teachers lives at school versus their home lives, and the most important, popularity. This move inside and out looks into the theme of popularity. It shows it in what I find to be a hilarious light, and also shows the downfalls of it.There was honestly nothing that I didn't enjoy about this film. I find everything about the movie Mean Girls hilarious and relatable. It is an amazing, comedic film which is why it is still so popular today.Overall, as you can tell, I love this movie and would rate it 10 out 10.",Mean Girls

There's precious little invention to their maneuvering, unlike, say, in ""Heathers,"" where the ruling high school clique showed real flair in its malevolence.Tina Fey, so witty in her Saturday Night Live role, is hopelessly adrift here and, in trying to provide some meaningful bottom-spin to an otherwise formulaic storyline, winds up forgetting to make any of her characters--or this movie-- the least bit compelling.",Mean Girls

The first day is really hard for her, but by the second day she makes friends with outcast ""Art Freaks"" Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian (Daniel Frazense). But at lunch, she unexpectedly gets invited into the The Plastics, the popular girls - Regina George (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert), and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). When Cady falls in so quickly with The Plastics, Janis takes advantage of the situation to plot against Regina who accused her of being lesbian three years ago. Cady becomes even more worried after seeing the Plastics' burn book (where they insult all girls in their grade), and writing something she shouldn't have in there. Next, Cady stupidly reveals her crush on dreamy Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Benett), Reginas' ex-boyfriend, and Gretchen soon tells Regina. After more drama including Regina taking back Aaron, Janis gets a very exact plot as to how to overthrow Regina. The only thing that works though, is giving Regina foot cream for face wash. After the month, December comes and nothing has happened. When Regina catches Cady talking to Janis, she explains her accusal of Janis being a lesbian. Cady gets to know more and more, from talking to Gretchen, whom Regina tells everything. After getting Aaron away from Regina, Cady works to ruin Reginas' physique by making her gain weight, while Regina thinks she is losing weight. Once that has worked, Cady starts to turn Gretchen and Karen against Regina, and by then everything is near to chaos. Regina finds out that the kaalteen bars have been making her gain weight, and immediately insults Cady in the burn book, but making it look like she wasn't guilty, and then publishes xeroxed burn book pages around the school. All the girls get talked to, even though there are just four that are guilty. A teacher gets the girls to do a trust fall/apology thing. When Janis' turn comes, she explains the plot against Regina, and the girls all come to support her. Regina stalks of mad, because she didn't think she could be so hated.....only to get hit by a bus.

At first I, as many others, mistook it for some dull, typical teen movie, but I just gotta like it better and better. And yet sometimes I found it somewhat a bit disturbing, not b'coz it's bad or something, but b'coz it's so true and wicked, and I did find myself in it, the evil part, you know, just like Cady. I love the way it develops the character Cady. She's not an angel, and she made mistakes. She even turned herself into a Plastic Gal, but I just love the ending, the solution for Cady and the others, and it's not too serious and so funny, esp. 'bout Regina takin' up sports ;)Mean Girls really makes us think, coz there's evil side in everyone of us, and when the movie points it out, it's just... you know, we're all afraid and feel a bit uncomfortable when the naked bad truth 'bout us reveal, even though we hell know that it does exist.

""dr"" phil said that if you have a teenage girl, you should see it because that's what they have to go through every school day. but what does he know about being a teenage girl? being one myself, i found it ridiculous. it wasn't even funny. the only time i laughed is when me friend beside me made a joke about how bad it was. i would have left the theater, but i was going to see it with some friends and my cousin for her birthday and thought it would be rude to just leave.here in quebec it's rated G, but if i were a mother, i would not let any of my young children go see it. they say slut, bitch and whore at least 50 times in it. please, spare yourselves the torture, don't see mean girls.",Mean Girls
489,sethly_pocket,Surprisingly good,10,21 April 2004,"Won't give any spoilers about this one since its not in theaters yet. What I will say is that after being dragged to an advanced screening of it expecting the worst, I left extremely pleased.A familiar cast, some really good acting, and lots of laugh-out-loud moments made this one great. The hilarious twists and surprises keep coming throughout the movie. Just when you start to think you've figured out the plot something unexpected happens to keep you interested.Despite the dull image given by the trailers, this movie should be a hit. Word of mouth will be the big promotion for this one. I definitely recommend it to anyone, male or female.8/10",Mean Girls
490,ben_caddaye,A Movie about Teen Problems and Relationships,7,23 May 2010,"This Film Is about, a young girl who is trying too find her place in an American High school, North shore high. The Movie Shows how teen relationships rise and fall, and how bullying and cliques have a large place in American high Schools. The Genre of the Movie is Teen Drama/Comedy. The Style of the movie is set though the eyes of Cady Heron, The Films Protagonist and shows her daily life, and the people who she interacts with from her point of View. The Style Shows all the Characters Emotions and the way they think in the style. I think this comedy is funny and Enjoyable, with someone morals set into the story. Some real life high School Problems are in the story with a comedy aspect to then, but some of the issues aren't too be joked about with these things being major Problems.",Mean Girls

I would recommended this movie for 8-50 year old because my mum is 40 and she would like the film and my younger cousin Eliza watched the film when it first came out and she was five years old at the time. my favourite part of the film was when Regina George was run over by the bus, to sum up my review it is five out of ten because it had good angels and camera shots but i did not like the film",Mean Girls
492,mcinturffhm,Mean Girls vs. Grease,10,28 August 2010,"Mean Girls is just one of those movies that all girls love. It's the easiest movie to quote and has lots of truth to it. I like the name of the group of girls that Cady is inducted into; the ""plastics."" The name describes them as perfect girls, like Barbie dolls. I also love Janis's character and how Regina, one of the ""plastics"", did something to hurt Janis's feelings as this is usually how it goes in high school; the popular, pretty people, pick on the brainy, not-so-pretty people. I enjoy the fact that after Cady becomes a ""plastic"" she returns to her nerdy math days; her normal self. The sarcasm and cruel humor is something we don't find in movies every day. Every girl looks up to Regina George in fashion, just like she is a fashion icon even though she is not nice to them. By the end of the movie the gossip that the ""plastics"" wrote about in the burn book is revealed and after many workshops to work on friendships, all of the girls became friends. I like the casting from Saturday Night Live which makes the film more enjoyable for people over the age of eighteen.There isn't much I dislike about the film but in the scene in which Cady, the newest ""plastic"", is in the mall where Janis works touching up her makeup, they make her look gross. Her face looks shiny and she doesn't fit the character in which she is supposed to portray; a perfect ""Barbie doll"" replica. I do not think that Lindsay Lohan was the absolute best choice for the role of Cady because it is hard to believe that she is sixteen; she looks older.In Grease, 1978, Sandy from Australia changes her innocent ways to impress a rebel, Danny, she met at the beach during summer vacation. In many ways Sandy is like Cady. They both change who they are to impress the kids at their schools and to fit in. Cady and Sandy are both coming to the U.S. from out of the country. Cady has been living in Africa with her parents and Sandy is from Australia. Sandy changes who she is for a boy while Cady initially changes just to fit in and find out what it is like to be a ""plastic."" After Cady falls for Aaron, a big risk since he is Regina's ex, all she cares about is giving him her full attention. She even begins to fail math, even though math is her best subject, just so she can have Aaron tutor her. In Grease, Sandy becomes friends with the ""Pink Ladies"", the hardcore rebel girls at Rydell High. She changes her girlish ways and begins smoking and wearing all leather clothes to turn him on, since he is a ""T-bird"", the hardcore rebel boys at Rydell. Grease is a musical often shown on Broadway and Mean Girls is just a comedy film produced by SNL member, Tina Fey, who also stars in the movie as Cady's math teacher and mathlete coach. Even though the two films were produced in different eras, the similarities between Cady and Sandy are extreme.",Mean Girls
493,dancer_chick1018,movie review for class,9,28 August 2010,I love the movie it is one of my all time favorite movies ever created. It has an interesting plot line and it seems almost like a how to movie on how to take down the queen bee. I think it is funny and interesting and romantic somewhat. The things that i liked about mean girls was that it showed how cliché high school is and how one thing can ruin your reputation. I also like that it shows how woman change themselves to get mens attention and losing a little of themselves in the process.i didn't like that after all the hard work and plotting and scheming Caty still did not get who she wanted in the end. It seems that it was all in vain and all the pain and embarrassment everyone involved suffered was completely pointless almost because it didn't end the way she wanted and she didn't get what she worked so hard to get.In a Cinderella story with Hillary duff she ended up with what she worked to get after everything that happened even when you think she is not going to have a happy ending she does and gets the guy. I really wish that mean girls had ended similarly because i think it would have made it better.,Mean Girls
494,stakey,Brilliance,10,21 October 2004,"Even before I read the book ""Queen Bees and Wannabes,"" which the movie is based on, I found the movie to be hilariously accurate. It's perfect for people of all ages, especially women, to relate to. Being a teenager in my second year of high school, I find it to be a wonderful film with a great storyline. Because the movie seems to be just a slight exaggeration of what real high school life is like, it's very informative to both teenagers and parents to know what's going on in the social world of school. It sends across a good message and I highly recommend it to girls and boys alike, as there is a lot to learn about ""girl world"" and the crazy things that happen in it.",Mean Girls
495,sierrapini,An overall triumph,7,26 January 2011,"Mean Girls is the best movie I have ever seen! It's so funny, I definitely recommend it. Regina George is the leader of the plastics she's evil but she couldn't have been a better beotch,Karen Smith is an idiot but she's so good at it,Gretchen Wieners just wants Regina George to like her,Damian is too gay too function,Janis Ian is an outcast who Regina George is convinced is in love with her,and Cady Heron is a girl from Africa who has been home schooled her whole life and is finally going to a real school and gets stuck in the middle of all of it.This movie is so FETCH!Mean girls is a movie like no other.Right now Regina George is writing the whole cast of Mean Girls 2 in her *BURN BOOK*.

496,nutmeg582,One of the funniest movies ever!,10,15 July 2004,"How do I begin describing this hilarious movie? Fey's smart and fresh screenplay offers audiences loads of laughter and fun in this side-splitting comedy! Packed with humorous one-liners and unforgettable monologues, the screenplay's creative blending of sarcasm and wit is bound to leave audiences amazed. Both the acting and the directing are well done and believable, which make the movie an even awesomer experience. The best thing about this movie is its ""grooling"" look at how Lindsay Lohan and her Plastics Posse can make mean look so good.""Shut up! Shut up!"" ""I didn't say anything.""""Hey, I'm having a little get-together at my house tomorrow night and I'd like you to come."" ""Will Regina be there?""

497,Rachelfoot,"Excellent comedy, NOT geared towards kids!",10,7 May 2004,"Like many other comments I've read on here, I went into this movie expecting a somewhat funny teen movie.  However, Mean Girls far exceeded my expectations and was the funniest movie I've seen since Old School.  I don't remember the last time I laughed so much in the theater (or the last time the rest of the theater laughed so hard, for that matter).  It should be noted that a majority of the crowd was late teens/twenty-somethings (including myself) which I think is a great age to appreciate the jokes and the behavior of all of the high school kids in the movie, from the clique stereotypes to the general manipulation that goes on.  Pre-teens and young teens simply won't appreciate the humor since they haven't lived through high school yet, and there certainly are scenes and jokes that aren't appropriate for young children.  That said, it is an extremely realistic take on high school life -- high schoolers do swear, drink, and have sex, and this movie captured it perfectly in a hysterical way!  Tim Meadows was wonderful as the principal (""Oh no way, I did NOT leave the south side for this!"" and I loved that they had so many smaller characters (Bad-Ass M.C., gay friend Damian, the parents, etc.) -- they kept the momentum moving and kept things interesting.  8/10.",Mean Girls
498,GrimReaper9,"Amazing Movie, Not just for teen girls but also adults",9,22 May 2004,"Well considering this is my first review ever I have definitely chosen a good movie. The start of the movie was amazing and so was the entire progress through to the part where Cady thinks of going ""human"". After that bit the entire movie turned into the normal teen flick where she realizes her ""true friends"" and where in the last scene(well technically) she kisses the guy. Although the storyline was very similar to others like jawbreakers but the script was amazing and this was a bit more slutty, more shrewd and more conniving. Overall its an amazing movie and can be seen by adults too to see what us teens go through everyday. Most of the elements in it are in fact true cause there is always one of the popular groups who act above everybody else. When i transferred from my school after 10th grade for the first few days even i used to sit alone in the bathroom ( not eat but just try to pass time playing games on my cell :) ).

I mean, they even use the same names and lines for God's sake!!!*Spoiler alert* It's exactly the same story! A girl who lived in Africa comes to America, becomes friends with the cool group that's called the plastics, falls in love with Reggina's ex, becomes cool too, decides to take revenge on her, feeds her with nutrition bars, has a gay friend etc etc. The only difference is that Reggina in this ""adaptation"" of the same script lives with her father instead of her mother!

I've just finished watching it, and for the first time i thought i should write a review in IMDb.From the cover it looks so lame (ill admit i just rented it for Lindsay, and the other hot girls on the cover), but its so well made. It tells the same story we've seen in many other films in such an original, realistic and funny way that you fell totally connected to the movie. There wasn't a single moment it bored me.

There are things that everyone can relate too, plus some great tricks to play on people.  They movie was like taking half the cast of SNL and sticking them into a 5x better version of Clueless.

502,DMon123,A Very Funny Movie That Might Escape Your Radar,9,18 February 2004,"Frankly, when I first heard about the movie, I hadn't seen any trailers or heard anything about it. All I had read was a synopsis that didn't really explain much of anything. I went into this movie expecting to be disappointed. Luckily, I was proven wrong, this is a very funny movie. I must say that the actors in this movie are absolutely terrific. Lindsay Lohan and all the girls really show their comedic chops, and they have Tina Fey leading the way. Tim Meadows is priceless as the school principal. The plot points seem a bit silly at times, but if you suspend your cynicism long enough to just sit back and enjoy, I promise you will be very entertained.",Mean Girls
503,dancerchica,Funniest Film all Season,10,1 May 2004,"As someone out of high school for a bit, seeing this movie from a 20-something perspective made it all the more hillarious. My (female) friend and I laughed the whole time.  The film is more in-depth than trailers let on-- this is not just an ex-boyfriend/revenge film.  Tina Fey did an excellent job bringing the book ""Queen Bees and Wannabees"" to the silver screen in a meaningful and (fairly) uncontrived way.  Many cast members (or former cast members) of SNL also make guest appearances in roles that suit them well, especially Tina Fey as the slightly embittered math teacher. (This of course is predictable, since she was a co-author of the screenplay.)",Mean Girls
504,shoppingcartjoe,Refreshing,8,13 May 2004,"Let's face it, nine out of ten teen movies are vapid excuses to showcase twenty-something actresses pretending to be in high school, all the while drinking, having sex, and if the movie has a lesson, maybe befriending a dorky kid. I'm not saying that ""Mean Girls"" is devoid of some of those things, but what sets the film apart from the pack is that it actually has something useful to say. Whereas most teen flicks are made specifically for teens (i.e. gratuitous partying and hot girls), Tina Fey's witty screenplay can be appreciated by anyone.Even if you have long since graduated high school or have yet to attend, there is something in ""Mean Girls"" that has a universal appeal. The points about friendship, love, and inversely how stupid either of those can be in high school, are well made without being repeatedly slammed on the viewer's head. I walked out of the theater actually feeling pretty good, and not just because of Lindsay Lohan. This is a mature, universally applicable film that just happens to be set in high school for some of the previously mentioned reasons. It easily falls into the same category as ""Heathers"" and ""Sixteen Candles"" without borrowing too much from them.There's much more to say, but the best way to avoid me having to type any more is for you to go out and see it yourself. There were some minor stylistic quibbles I had in terms of the directing, but nothing to keep me from going back to see it again, as well as buying the DVD.I give it an 8/10",Mean Girls
505,FireIce555,"ugh, modern day Heathers? Not in a million years",1,2 May 2004,"Geesh, not another Lindsey Lohan movie...just like Hilary Duff, her roles require no acting skills at all. For the movie itself, most jokes fall flat and depends on the usual jokes (i.e. the infamous ""ditzy girl"" tripping. How unoriginal can Hollywood get? Mean Girls start off decent enough. Cady (Lindsey Lohan) has been homeschooled all her life, shilded from the ways of bitchy high school girls. She goes to a public typical high school, and makes friends with the most popular girls in school (The Plastics). Things go downhill from here, and it never gets better.

And while no storyline can be amazing new and original, this take on the politics among females in high school is snappy and executed well. It's no American Beauty, but it's not trying to be. By itself, it is a brilliant movie that makes you laught, and look at yourself, too.Lindsay Lohan does a fantastic job in her role as Cady, making up very well for the amazing horror that ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" caused its audience, while it's supporting cast, including Tina Fey, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried keep the film's energy pumping from beginning to end.

I expected it to be totally unrealistic of school (like lizzie mcguire)some things were, but i actually could relate to a lot of it.the movie did show how cliques worked, in school it isin't really like that but it is pretty accurate. for instance, i don't think you would really get kicked out of your lunch table for wearing sweat pants on monday but i could see girls wearing pink every wednesday and if you don't wear the right clothes you will not be accepted by your peers. i was also happy to see that there wasan't a food fight!!!

Girls really are a lot more mean than boys, in the way that they(we) do sneaky little things behind each others back, instead of coming out and punching them LOL. Girls' fights can last up to months and a lot of times, some hold grudges against each other for years. Although a lot of this goes on in Highschool, I think that it is almost worse it Middle School and Elementry (at least that was my experience).I love almost all shows that Lindsay Lohan is in, so that just made this movie better.

509,caseyc_ebay,100 Times Better Than I Thought It Would Be!,10,1 May 2004,"""It was 100 times better than I thought it would be"" - were my exact words when I walked out of the theater. I just watched this with my sister today expecting it to be a good movie. It was so much more than I thought. My main reason to watch this movie is because of two of the main actresses in it - Lindsay Lohan and Tina Fey (SNL) - it also includes other members of the Saturday Night Live cast who are hillarious. It is not your normal ""kiddy"" teen or chick flick - guys were laughing just as much as girls were. It is very true to teen life and doesn't sugarcoat it AT ALL - Lot's of SEXUAL CONTENT , CUSSING,  DRUG CONTENT, and VIOLENCE which was great to see and hear. I think it is what sets it apart from all the other boring teen movies which are fake and fairytailish (it that a word?). I notices a question on the message board which was asking why so many gay guys are wanting to see it - it's because it has huge gay appeal and one of the main characters is a gay guy (so funny!!!). To sum it all up... there was not a boring scene in the whole movie. I would reccomend it to anyone!!! Can't wait until the DVD. Thank you to whoever made this movie - it brightened up my week :)",Mean Girls

Instead, it had more references to sexually-implicit content than I'd ever care to expose my child to in a lifetime. (STD's, lesbians and whores, 'fugly sluts,' and too-large-vaginas requiring oversized tampons, among other things...)Why this managed to garner a PG rating in Canada is totally beyond me. Even in the US, it appears that all it got was a PG-13. Disgusting!This is definitely not fodder for the younger audience. Be forewarned!!!",Mean Girls
511,adriennelane80,A Refreshing Good Movie!,10,9 May 2004,"First and foremost, I loved this movie.  It is so reminiscent of my high school years and then my experience in the teaching field.  Girls ARE very mean to each other, and there is almost always one girl that is the Queen who everyone either likes or is too scared to stand up to her.  In my high school, there was a just like Regina, mother included.  If parents are having a hard time understanding their daughter, they should take a look at this movie.  I can remember totally disliking the popular girls, yet wanting their approval at the same time. Mean Girls is a great deal the way school is.  My husband enjoyed this movie also.  It gave him an interesting look into the psyche of the teenaged girl, a subject that seems to baffle him. Tina Fey did a wonderful job in making a movie with SNL people and production that wasn't stupid like so many others.  This is a smart movie. It reminds me of Heathers and Sixteen Candles.",Mean Girls
512,cocacolaroxdaworld,A Cute Summer Flick,9,14 May 2004,"Tina Fey's first swing at penning a full length feature is a hit.  The quick-paced dialogue and intriguing storyline (a somewhat realistic one at that) are translated nicely to the screen by Waters.  Lohan is entirely believable as her character's personality changes from one scene to the next.  The supporting teens all hold there own (at least they don't draw attention to themselves).  McAdams, Chabert, and Seyfried are all realistically snotty and ignorant.  Bennett seems so nice and looks so incredibly cute, it's no wonder Lohan's character is head-over-heels.  A small SNL reunion takes place, as many of the supporting adult roles are played by ex-members and present cast members, all of whom had to the picture as a whole.  Overall, the movie was light and enjoyable.  I don't plan on seeing it again in theaters, but I will probably rent it when it comes out on DVD.  9/10.",Mean Girls

Obviously not the most brain stretching of movies, but nevertheless very enjoyable. It's not just for girls either. The humour in Mean Girls is quite different from that which one would expect from a film of this genre and would appeal to a broader age range than the 12-15 years to which the advertising is aimed. It is clear that the actors, young and older, really enjoyed making this film and their performances reflect that. A warning to parents though - Mean Girls is distinctly risqué in places considering its 12A rating. I don't think i'd let anybody younger than 12 watch this movie.",Mean Girls

Cady is a 16-year-old girl who has just moved to the United States, from, you didn't guess it, Africa. She's never been to a real school before, but the hard world this is, there is a huge chance she'll learn it. Quickly. Also, Karen Smith is one of the funniest (.. because she's not all too smart) characters EVER. She has the best quotes I've ever seen. As the movie just goes on and on, you really start to feel like you're Cady. You're Cady, who just moved from Africa and has never been to a real school.

I have to admit, reading the plot or looking at posters it made the movie seem immature and a bit ""I've seen this happen before"", but I think its very different to any other teen-movie around at the minute. It has an edge. I think this edge has to do with the casting...Lindsey Lohan is a star, her role in Freaky Friday was excellent and her role in Mean Girls is even better. The actresses who play the roles of 'the Plastics' may seem slutty and dumb, but play the roles with style and very good-humour.

From a guy's perspective, it's interesting to see how much power women wield over other girls and the men in their lives. In the social arena, women seem to be pushing all the buttons, directly or indirectly. This movie illustrates this very well. As a study of women alone, Mean Girls is worth the price of admission. It was also surprisingly funny and the girls are beautiful. Kudos to Tina Fey for writing the witty screenplay. She's great performing on Saturday Night Live and shines with the pen on this script. The new face of Lindsay Lohan is welcome. I'm not sure what to think of her just yet, but I liked her in this movie and Freaky Friday.

520,ajohnston6,The Transformation from Human to Plastic,8,16 November 2012,"Finding your niche in high school could be difficult. As a junior, walking down the hallway of a new high school for the first time it can be overwhelming. In the case of Cady Heron, who moved from Africa, to discover her niche she had to find the right friends and adapt to the culture of North Shore. This would prove to be a daunting task. The movie Mean Girls is all about the typical high school experience, the queen-bee and her followers, the cattiness between girls, and the always present drama because of boys. Most teenage girls have seen Mean Girls multiple times because it is a comedy filled with drama that has become a sleepover hit. Whether it is your first time or your tenth time to watch it, you are guaranteed to laugh and at times relate to the experiences of Cady Heron. I personally liked the movie Mean Girls because it was all about the extremities of high school girls and their desire to fit in with the most popular girls on campus. The Plastics, the most popular girls, Regina George and her two followers, can make you transform from a typical high school girl to a Plastic wannabe. The Plastics seemed to be perfect in everyone's eyes but their own. Every girl in high school desired to be like them. The Plastics set the fashion trends. When queen-bee, Regina George had circles cut out of her tank top during gym and her bra was seen under it, almost every other girl in school cut holes in their tank top to be just like her. The Plastics practically ran the school; they had so much control over the other girls, they even had control over the teachers and the principal. The Plastics got away with breaking school dress code, ruining other girl's relationships, lying, hooking up with guys during school, backstabbing and making The Burn Book. Ethically the movie shows the typical high school girl cattiness. Queen-bee Regina George is tricked by the new Plastic, Cady Heron, into losing her hot body, her group of friends and her boyfriend Aaron Samuels. Logically no school principal would ever allow a group of girls to become so powerful or get away with as much as they did but adding that to the movie made it more entertaining. Tina Fey eloquently wrote the script for Mean Girls, in a way the viewers could emotionally attach to the characters. The viewers felt as though they made the transformation from human to plastic with Cady Heron. I believe Mean Girls was written in order to make people laugh. Tina Fey exaggerated typical high school experiences but presented them in a way that is not so different than real life. The depiction of girl on girl cattiness is very realistic and the struggle to be queen-bee is a picturesque description of a high school girls climb to the top of popularity. There was an actual value to the movie. I feel it taught teenage girls the price of becoming Plastic was not worth changing themselves. In the end, being cordial with everyone makes high school less dramatic. Although, Tina Fey may have depicted some extreme behaviors, Mean Girls, was designed to entertain the viewers and that is exactly what it accomplished. I would give this movie eight out of ten stars because it made me laugh and kept me emotionally attached. The transformation of Cady Heron, from a regular human girl into a Plastic girl was presented in a way that audiences of all ages could relate to.",Mean Girls
521,screamymimi7,Mean Girls: A need to watch!,9,9 November 2012,"Mean Girls is a clever, witty, and downright hilarious movie that is a need to watch for teens entering high school. Although I have seen it many times, I would be eager to stand in line and watch it again! Brian Dannelly, the director, really captures the essence of inspirational movie making in having amazing actors, clever wit, and creating a relatable storyline. A commonly made mistake is having a great story line, but simply bad actors. However, Dannelly obviously took time when carefully choosing actors for Mean Girls. A personal favorite of mine would be Rachel McAdams, who plays the character of Regina George, the wealthy, pretty, popular girl who can get anything she desires by the snap of her fingers. ""She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me? Who does she think she is?"" She was perfect for this role because she found a way to portray a teenage attitude, but still manage to act superbly. Another fabulous actor was Tina Fey, who acted as the high school math teacher. Although she does not have significant part, her detailed expressions and constant interest in her position made her stand out in my mind.Additionally, clever wit plays a key role in a well- done movie. Dannelly did not go over the top in his humor and wit. ""It was just the right amount"" as some might say. The most memorable moment in the movie was when Cady Herron, the main character played by Lindsay Lohan, who was originally planned to play Regina George, imagines high school to be comparative to the wild African bush, (she refers to her past home). Then she imagines everything to be breaking out into a jungle fight at a watering hole. I found my self laughing hysterically at this simply because it was clever and funny; this made Mean Girls very memorable. On the other hand, many people are quick to say that they do not like the character Regina George because she does not set a necessarily good example, therefore many do not like the movie. However, you must be willing to accept that Dannelly was not trying to influence teens negatively, but wishes to show the funny, and true side of things, because after all, nobody is perfect. In addition, several viewers think that it is just another movie about teenage girls, but really here is a much deeper meaning. It explains how high school is full of rumors, gossip, and backstabbing, but if you take time to dig deeper for quality friends, then it is invariably possible. Furthermore, the final ingredient for the perfect recipe, was creating a relatable storyline. Having this aspect is a large crowd pleaser because everything is more enjoyable when you can relate to it. In a less extreme way, this movie perfectly portrays the typical public high school, in the sense that there are always going to be a group of ""Those Girls"". Being relatable really closed the deal for me. It was the reassurance to my initial impression. Lastly, being the type of person that is fairly particular in movies, I surprised myself when I could openly say that I loved it. I enjoyed this movie to the maximum level and would watch it again any day. For not only was it well casted, cleverly written, and relatable, but it was spectacularly done and the top contender for the best movie I have seen.",Mean Girls
522,liyah-99,Mean Girls Review,10,9 November 2012,"""Mean Girls"" is a great movie in which the actors all portray high schoolers going through school drama. The drama is an over exaggerated example of the real struggles students face with bullying, judgment, and cliques. When Cady comes from being home schooled in Africa to struggling for survival in a normal high school, her and her new friends have plans to take down the rulers of the school known as ""the plastics"". With the help of the amazing actors, great plot, and mixed in humor, I rate mean girls a ten! Lindsay Lohan playing the role of Cady is a good match as Lohan is the right age and knows how to act within this context. She gives off a confident vibe as she marches through the halls with the plastics, but knows how to tone it down when it comes to being around the senior crush. Rachel Mcadams adapts well into the life of Regina George, the plastic leader. She shows her anger and accomplishes the job of being an evil queen bee. Even the tone in her voice helps get her message across during the simplest parts such as saying to Cady ""get in loser, we're going shopping."" Overall, Amanda Seyfried, Tina Fey, Tim Meadows, Lacey Chabert, and the other selected actors pull together to create a phenomenal performance that contributes with the story line to make an enticing movie. Humor is scattered even in the details of this film and is layered on throughout the whole thing. The mixture of the comedic actors pairs with the sarcastic and hilarious script to form something worth laughing at. Even when Damien, one if Cady's closest friends, refers to Regina while saying ""She's fabulous, but she's evil"", there is a combination of facial expression and tone making this simple phrase something laughable. Little pieces of the movie with slight sarcasm and humor help to make this film perfect.Although some of this humor could be considered vulgar and there are parts that may not be appropriate for youth, this movie is not intended for them. This movie uses slightly vulgar and harsh in some parts, but it adds to the funny plot and is realistic. Keep in mind these students are regular high schoolers and, just like any other students, tend to make sexual or crude comments. In addition, there are many pieces adding up to form the final work. Little parts add to the plot line and increase the interest of the viewers' minds. So many things go on, but they all compliment each other to give an intriguing, relatable movie plot where you are never bored. In conclusion, some may have an idea set in their head and infer that ""Mean Girls"" is another cheesy, chick flick, high school based movie, but it really does show developing of characters' attitudes and personalities. They show real emotion and it is a creative new story that was told in a good way in this movie.",Mean Girls
523,julia_stahr,Fun and light hearted film!,8,12 November 2012,"In the story it is Cady Heron's first day of school at the age of sixteen. She has lived in Africa all her life and therefore she was home-schooled. She is clueless about the teenage world of high school, and the struggles within it. On her first day she makes friends with a strange goth named Janice and a gay guy named Damian. They guide her through high school and talk her into becoming a part of ""the plastics"" the three cheerleaders who are the most popular as well as the bitchiest in the school, in order to find out things about them. Cady goes through with it and gets introduced to the world of the plastics.The plot develops with many memorable and funny scenes, with hilarious quotes. The story turns the struggles of high school into a very funny teen comedy. Mean Girls will be loved by teen age girls, as this is the audience that the film is targeted at, as well as adults. The film stars Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron, and Rachel McAdams as Regina George (the leader of the plastics). Overall a very fun and light hearted film!",Mean Girls
524,hapagirl1993,Inappropriate for young girls,3,22 January 2005,"I went to mean girls, and I came out disgusted. I brought my daughter to the movie with me, thinking it would be a fun ""chick flick"" for us to go to. Many girls her aged told her it was good, and said nothing about the sexuality, language, or THOUGHTS running through Lindsay Lohan's head. My family descents as home-schoolers, and I home-school my daughter, and I found the beginning of 'Mean Girls' very offensive to all home-schoolers. Not all home-schoolers are very smart, weird, or religious. And of COURSE, Lindsay Lohan couldn't possibly be any of that either. This is what I have to say about what I thought bad about this movie. However, the plot and message was good, I don't think any girls that aren't in high school, or exposed to this should see 'Mean Girls'.",Mean Girls

My wife rented this movie and to be honest, I had no interest in watching it at all. I sat down with her to watch it for a few minutes while I waited for a baseball game to start. The movie had me laughing so hard that I forgot about the ballgame entirely. This is a truly funny movie that is clever enough to keep your interest from start to finish. The movie is also well cast. This movie was by far one of the funniest movies that I have seen in a while. I highly recommend this movie if you are wanting to see a funny over the top type film.

Please, please, I beg of you, if you have not yet wasted 90 minutes of your life on this dribble, save your time and money!The only reason that I viewed the movie is because I had rather liked ""Freaky Friday"".

529,littlemissspud,"Mean Girls, Mean Movie!",9,31 December 2004,"Walking into the movie, everyone expects a comedy about being who you really are. Walking back out, people remember a great movie with a good plot, an interesting message, and some great laughs. Don't get me wrong. Some of the jokes are a little corny, some of the plot is familiar, and there are some snafus along the way. But, for a teen-aimed movie about a well-known topic, it rose above the usual, and created quite a good movie. *Spoiler Below* So, Cady Heron is, unsurprisingly, a teen trying to fit in. Seeing as she's spent her life in Africa, this is quite a feat. She starts to make friends with two geeky art freaks, when she is scoped by the In Crowd, in the form of the Plastics, Karen, Gretchen and Regina, the elite hot squad. Janis and Damian try to get Cady to spy on Regina, and all is going well when Cady sets her eye on Aaron Samuels, Regina's ex. Dating an ex is strictly against the rules of the Plastics, so when Queen Bee Regina finds out, she decides to put herself between Cady and Aaron. When Regina takes Aaron back, Cady and her friends set out to ruin Regina's life, while ruining Cady's as well. When the war between Cady and Regina catches up to each other, they are both left friendless and alone, and when the Plastic's Burn Book of nasty rumors becomes mainstream, all heck breaks loose. Will Cady save the day? (duh) Will true love conquer all? Will Regina's spine ever heal? Well... you'd have to watch the movie. It really is a good movie, and it would be a mistake not to watch.",Mean Girls

The character development was poor at best. The ongoing African animal behavioral references just didn't work IMO. And the stereotypes could have been stretched a little further (the gay guy could have been gayer, the mean girls could have been meaner, and the black/Indian math geek/rapper could have been much more interesting). The movie seemed to struggle with what it really wanted to be. Was it a SNL sketch? Another American Pie sequel? A remake of a 1980's John Hughes movie? Yes, a little, to all of the above. But in reality it just isn't good enough to be compared to any of the aforementioned groups and left me feeling a little cheated - even as a rental.",Mean Girls
531,ranya-1,Excellent Hollywood Movie with a female voice,8,15 December 2004,"I watched this movie with my partner, on the recommendation of my brother's teenage daughters, and we found it to be a great deal of fun, and to have a surprisingly female ""voice"". Certainly it is an American movie made with the frowns of American parents in mind, but its voice is only slightly muted by that frown, and if some things must be inferred, and other done with a wink and a grin, at least the concessions to the Old White Men who run Hollywood were minimized as well. None of the girls' were required to peel off there tops for the sake of the 40-year old teenagers in the audience, and the most that can be said with any certainty to have taken place is some making out---I'm not sure one could even call it ""petting"". The only drug in use is alcohol, and even that is used sparingly.If you can talk to your 11-18 year-old daughter without quoting bible passages out of context, there's nothing in this movie to offend you, or your daughter. Your husband is your problem. If there is one thing that sets this movie apart from other ""teen chic flicks"", it is that is a movie about being a girl, not about being a girl in as boys imagine it might be, or as men desire it to have been.SPOILER ALERT If there are the obligatory plot devices required of a commercial film---the ""Handsome Boy"", the ""Bad Girls"", a few ""Girls-in-their-Underwear"" scenes (and a beautifully ironic scene in the projection room), a few ""Kissing Scenes"", and ""The Happy Ending"", they are more than paid for with the reality of life as an adolescent girl in American public schools. If there is one scene that will upset your husband/boyfriend/father, it is probably the ""Christmas Show"", because of its ""Sexy Girls"" show-theme. Being as it is no more, and rather less, than most cheerleader cheers and nearly all of the women's athletic events at the 2004 Olympics, I can't see the big deal...but then, I'm a girl. END SPOILER ALERTLindsay Lohan is a beautiful young woman who has not yet been butchered by the OWM (or, rather, the OGWM) who run Hollywood and dictate a stick-chic standard of female ""beauty"". If the fact that she is both young, and manifestly a woman, is bothersome to those whose memories of their adolescence were erased during childbirth, that is hardly a reason to rate the movie other than as it is. A great movie to watch with your daughter, with your friends, or by yourself.

The girls in the movie totally remind me of certain girls that I went to high school with ... of course some parts are a little exaggerated but when u take a step back and think about the message and the movie as a whole it is sadly truthful. Youth today is very much survival of the fittest and if that means hurting other people most teens will do so without a second thought. The part about being part of the plastics was like being famous is so true ... in my high school if you were part of the ""in-crowd"" everyone knew everything about you ... who you were dating, who you used to date, what classes you were in, and if you were having a party or going to someone else's party. If u were seen with the ""inroad"" then you were assumed to be part of it and soon people would know everything about you ...

533,sex_kitten_here,review of mean girls,10,29 December 2004,"It's like a jungle out there, and Cady Heron  pronounced as 'Katy' should know. Cady recently moved to America after living in Africa for the first 15 years of her life with her parents. Both her parents are research zoologists. They had to move because Betsy Heron (Cady's mother, played by Ana Gasteyer) got a place at Northwestern. Cady thinks she knows all about the survival of the fittest and the laws of the jungle but she soon realises that high school is a jungle in itself and soon learns that students can be just like wild animals. This screenplay, by Saturday Night Live writer Tina Fey (who also co-stars as Cady's Maths teacher), is based on the US best seller Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping your daughter survive cliques, gossip, boyfriends and other realities of adolescence (very long but catchy title). The story of this book may be fictional but the setting is authentic. Fey clearly remembers how cruel and unkind kids can be, and the endless desire to be cool at school  whether through the way you speak, dress-sense or the way you act. The script is witty, of great excellence and crucially true.Mean Girls stars the popular Lindsay Lohan, now a 17 year old who has two big hits (Freaky Friday and the remake of The Parent Trap) but with those two hits there has been one surprising miss (Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen).paired up again with freak Friday's director, Mark S. Waters. Lindsay dazzles us once more. Lindsay does more than just act though; she has also sung songs in other films such as Princess Diaries 2. Lindsay also has a lot of roles lined up for her in the future. Of course Lindsay would be nothing without the rest of the cast to back her up and give her support. It was a tough call for the actresses that wanted the part of Regina George as it was very close between Rachel McAdams (who eventually got the role) and Amanda Seyfried. The producer, Lorne Michaels, had Amanda lined up for the part of Regina until Rachel came an auditioned. Then they had a hard decision to choose between the two actresses. But they chose to assign the part of Karen Smith to Amanda because they felt that she was better at playing 'the dumb girl'. That covers 'Mean' and 'Meanest', so in the middle is 'Meaner'. This is Gretchen Wieners (Lasey Chabert), the one out of the three that is filthy rich (her father was the inventor of toaster strudel) and ""would rather be in the plastics hating life, than not be in at all"". Cady soon finds shelter and instantly bonds with two of what the school call the 'out crowd'. Janis Ian (Lizzie Caplan), a Goth girl who is taunted for supposedly being a lesbian, bit she isn't. Damian (Daniel Franzese), who has been called ""Too gay to function"". Janis and Damian persuade naive Cady to join the plastics. The herd is lead by their Queen Bee Regina George (the acid  tongued Rachel McAdams) who is always accompanied by her two bitches-in-waiting, Gretchen (Lasey Chabert) and Karen (Amanda Seyfried). Karen is the dumb-as-a-stone blonde who claims to have 'ESPN' (an American news and weather channel) bragging that her boobs can predict rain, well they can tell if it is raining if she is outside. Regina reigns over everyone by breaking down everyone else that gets in her way.The plot has Janis (who has been hurt more than once by Regina George because of rumours started) convincing Cady to go deep undercover as a 'plastic' the name for Regina's group of little bitches. Sabotage is planned, then Cady being cool. Cady is meant to be like one of Regina's loyal followers and be devoted to her at all times but Cady has other plans up her sleeve. Cady is trying to find dirt on Regina and use it against her in any possible way she can. As an undercover investigator will admit, entering a different scene of what you are not used to can change you and Cady will also be one of the first to admit this as soon Cady becomes less and less like her old friends and more and more like her new evil ones. In some of the movies more original moments, the students start acting like the animals that Cady is used to observing in the wild of the Savannah. An example of this would be that the fountain in the local mall is transformed into an animal watering hole. Cady begins as a sort of rogue agent befriending Regina and her gang of bitches while plotting against her with Janis and Damian. But thanks to a romantic entanglement with Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) Cady becomes more obsessed with defeating the plastic princess than her friends ever were. When Regina finds out Cady likes her ex Aaron Regina seeks revenge and takes Aaron back (even though she was the one who broke up with him). When Cady finds out, what began as a game to discover secrets about the plastics turns into a plan to destroy Regina. Now Cady, Janis and Damian plot together to bring Regina's status down. This begins Cady's slow transformation from harmless home-schooled teenager into a selfish plastic bitch. However this plan doesn't work out as planned, as Cady spends more time with the plastics, she, too, becomes one.",Mean Girls

At this time a girl will hate another for the simple reason that she may have the boy she likes or the better clothes.

This movie however, does not fall into the category of yet another Saturday Night Live movie....This movie however is not a simple teenage movie with it's simple love story and simple problems along the way this story has many sub-texts in which can relate to children and adults.

Mean Girls, Mark Waters' high-school survival story, fizzes with peculiarly feminine evil, of the kind that comes dripping through a pillowy smirk garnished with baby-pink lip gloss. Our field-guide in the world of warring American schoolgirl cliques is Cady (Lindsay Lohan), a 15- year-old who has been raised – and home-tutored – in the African bush by her zoologist parents. Bush life has not prepared her for the jungle that is North Shore High School, a conceit that was laboured just enough to make me grateful that Waters didn't take it any further. Mean Girls is inspired by the factions described in Rosalind Wiseman's best-selling dissection of vicious teenage mores: Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence. At North Shore High, blonde Regina George (Rachel McAdams) is the undisputed Queen Bee of a clique called the Plastics: a strutting, bitchy trio with super-skimpy designer clothes, dazzling teeth and cleavages that would do a Las Vegas pole-dancer proud.it was a funny movie, but i think it would be awkward to watch it with family",Mean Girls

To a girl in high school -- this movie made a lot of sense and could make them realize being the coolest kid in school...really may not be that cool. It shows that you can still have fun and be friends with everyone and not just stick to one group, or a certain click and leave out so many other worth people.

542,msambro,Mean Girls Review,10,5 October 2013,"Mean Girls has become a classic among all young females. Even if you have memorized all the lines in Mean Girls and watched it over twenty times, it never gets boring or old. The movie was estimated to make $17,000,000 in ticket sales but it actually made over $85,000,000, proving that those buying tickets to see Mean Girls were clearly not just its target audience of teenage girls. The entire movie is based around the concept of high school stereotypes and the vicious truth about high school cliques. Mean Girls does a phenomenal job of addressing the serious topic of how girls lose sight of their true identity just to fit in with the ""popular"" group of kids. The stereotypes are so extreme that it makes the movie comical and keeps the audience giggling all ninety- seven minutes of the film. Parent Trap and Disney Channel star Lindsey Lohan does a phenomenal job of playing the role of Cady, the protagonist of the movie. Lohan's character Cady is the stereotypical smart, sweet, ""new girl in town"" who transforms into the vicious, yet beautiful stereotypical ""popular"" girl in high school. Lohan nails every aspect of her character. In the beginning of the movie Cady portrays the image of what many would consider the stereotypical, average high school girl. Her hair pulled up in a ponytail, wearing jeans and converses, nothing about Cady's appearance makes her stand out. She excels academically but feels lonely because she is the new girl in school. I really like how Cady's ""new girl"" character is played out in the movie because it's realistic and relatable. Every teenage girl has felt like the awkward new girl at some point in her life, doing everything in her power not to stand out. The real comedy of Mean Girls comes into play when Cady meets ""The Plastics"". ""The Plastics"" are the stereotypical popular high school girls. Rachel McAdams plays the role of Regina George, the boss of the group. Regina George is so extreme she is hilarious. Regina is so obsessed with her image that she refuses to wear sweatpants to school, gain a single pound, or be associated with anyone who she would consider ""weird"". One of the most well known scenes in the movie is when the plastics tell Cady that on Wednesdays they wear pink and that if she is not wearing pink then she can't sit with them at lunch. This behavior is obviously very extreme for the stereotypical ""popular"" high school girl, which makes it so funny. Another example of the plastics intensity and humor is when Gretchen kicks Regina out of the lunch group because she wore sweatpants to school. It turns out that Cady was sabotaging Regina, feeding her protein bars to make her gain weight in an attempt to ruin Regina's life. Rachel McAdams masters the role of mean girl Regina George by exaggerating every thing she does and says throughout the movie. Many critics say that Mean Girls has a ""dull plot"" or very ""dull humor"" but I could not disagree more. The plot of Mean Girls is the storyline of how one average high school girl gets so engulfed with the destruction of the ""mean popular girls"" that she becomes an even worse person than any of the original ""plastics"". The lesson for high school girls is that the most important thing to do is to stay true to oneself and not to worry about fitting in with the popular kids. Once Cady is a true ""plastic"" and has transformed herself completely, no one likes her or wants to be around her anymore. The success of the movie is due in large part to the extreme stereotypes who find themselves in one comical scenario after another. Without the classic ""you can't sit with us"" line or the ""on Wednesdays we wear pink"" line, Mean Girls would have just been a tutorial on how to survive high school. Mean Girls is one of the best movies ever made because of its light-hearted and comical approach to a serious topic that most teenagers can relate to.",Mean Girls

This popular film starred various well-known faces and introduced some new ones as well.Cady Heron's family moves from Africa to Illinois and becomes an instant hit with The Plastics, the popular girl clique at her new school. Seeing this, the revengeful Damien and Janis take advantage of the situation and use Cady as infiltrator to destroy Regina George's reputation. She makes the huge mistake of falling for Aaron Samuels, the ex-boyfriend of alpha Plastic Regina George. This triggers a series of dramatic events that eventually lead to a conclusion that makes everyone happy.This film served as a great entertainment for a wide range of audiences although the main spectators this movie targeted were the adolescent population. In my opinion, Lindsay Lohan performed the role of good-girl Cady Heron in an excellent manner with her innocent appearance and acting skills. All the other actors seemed rather connected with their roles and comfortable with Waters's directing. Mean Girls' running time was budgeted wisely and was only 96 minutes, making it straight to the point without any useless stretched out scenes. All the conflicts of the movie were suspenseful and grabbed a lot of attention. Watching this excellent teen comedy film was truly worth every minute. It was humorous but had a serious story about high school and its memorable experiences.",Mean Girls

She's been home-schooled all her life and lived with her parents in the African bush. She has known nothing of the deceitful, backstabbing and ugly world of high school. Upon arrival she makes friends with a level-headed goth and a fat guy gay. They instruct her on who is naughty, nice and full of vice. The 'in' group of the school are 'The Plastics' (because they're so fake), a trio of cheerleaders who make everyone's life hell.The leader is Regina George, the nastiest girl in the universe and at her side and the dumb and airhead Gretchen Wieners and Karen Smith (played by the impossibly cute Amanda Seyfried). In order to take them down Cady must become one of them. She takes great pride in ruining Regina only to take her place. Much like Arnie did in Predator, she became a monster in order to destroy a monster. With loads of observational humor and satire, Mean Girls ends up being a very intelligent movie, sort of a 'Clueless' that's not so nineties. A lot of attention is paid to character and performance, not something hastily thrown together and chucked out there. Originally it ended up with an R rating and had to be toned down. I would have loved to see that cut of the film.Another interesting thing is that I've always though Lindsay Lohan looked like the character of Ginny in Friday the 13th Part 2. So it was weird when the movie was featured in Mean Girls and had Cady startle her pals watching it by bursting through the door as soon as Jason bursts through the window.I will probably buy this on DVD when it comes out and I suggest you see it on the big screen.

The cast portrays a high school nightmare that is sickly amusing to watch along with infamous Regina George (Rachel McAdams) who we just love to hate. With all of the crappy movies out there about high school, Mean Girls looks like comedic genius. The script and characters are among the funniest and well developed compilation in years. Although it's not your classic The Breakfast Club, there are still some classic traits of cliques, stereotypical issues, and of course DRAMA. And Mean Girls doesn't miss a beat when it comes to keeping an entertaining balance of drama and comedy. We watch the main character, Cady (Lindsay Lohan), ""a home-schooled jungle freak"" go from good to bad to worse after she is sucked into an abyss when she begins to attend North Shore (public high school.)In the beginning she meets two friends Janis (a formerly accused lesbian) (Lizzy Caplan) and Damien (a male who is obviously in touch with his feminine side) (Daniel Franzese) who warn her about the cliques in high school, something may I remind you that ""innocent"" (I know we all think of Lindsay Lohan of anything but innocent, but bear with me here) Cady knows nothing about. They inform her especially of a clique called ""The Plastics,"" whom are a bit more intense version of your evil cyborg witches that manipulate the world into getting whatever they want. (We all know them.) Eventually ""The Plastics"" notice Cady and take interest in her (of course predominantly on her looks, but why else would they ask her to sit at their table?) and her naïve soul can't say no. After discussing the predicament with the ""Burnout"" friends (Janis and Damien) they decide this could be a good opportunity to possibly seek out some hidden revenge and plan some girl-on-girl guerrilla warfare. Throughout the film Cady finds herself in a constant battle between being herself and being accepted by the people around her. She eventually forgets who she is and makes herself a ""clone"" of Regina George, knocking Regina off her pedestal, and all hell breaks loose. As North Shore crumbles and chick fights go down in the hallway, Cady realizes she is in too deep and begins to reassess the life she is choosing. The witty and hormone-induced dialogue and the pronounced characters in the film are not disappointing along the way. And I think it is safe to say we can all relate our lives to the events the happen in Mean Girls. The journey that Cady goes through is awkwardly comedic and relatable. We must all ""suck the poison out of our lives.""",Mean Girls
550,m-bruesewitz35,high school movie that is spot on in every way,10,25 September 2014,"Mean Girls exceeds expectations! Directed by Mark Water, who has also done movies that could be considered more of a chick flick such as Freaky Friday, you would have thought this one would have been another total chick flick for the younger generation. But it transcends the teen and chick genres through its witty characters, amazingly dead-on perception of high school and snappy dialog, written by Tina Fey. In Mean Girls, Cady Heron, played by Lindsay Lohan, moves from Africa, where her anthropologist parents' home schooled her; to an American high school where cliques rule the jungle. Upon her arrival, she is befriended by two people considered outcasts and by their enemies, who call themselves the Plastics, a trio of fashion plates (Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert) who rule the school. Cady, convinced by her new outcast friends, helps to try to sabotage the power and popularity of the queen Plastic, Regina, played by McAdams. But the stellar comedy is conveyed through their antics and thought out plans that often backfire, like when they cut holes in Regina's shirt during gym class and she wears it anyways and acts like nothing happened. The next day, the entire female student body shows up with holey shirts. Their plot also Major backfires when Cady finds herself seduced by popularity and everything that comes with the power, which includes a major cat fight with Regina over the hottest guy in school. Mean Girls is aided by the fact that Fey's writing for the characters is spot on. The teens in this movie talk just like real teenagers, and all of the characters, even the side ones, are representative of cliques and situations you would find in your own high school. One excellent example is found in Regina's mother (Amy Poehler) who tries really hard to be the ""cool mom' by dressing just like the Plastics and serving non-alcoholic margaritas to the teenagers. Even if this might be a bit over the top, most teenagers know parents who try way too hard to be cool and relive their youth. Plus, the dialog, is spot on for what some teenagers would say and is hilarious. For example, Karen, the ditsy and air-headed Plastic, hears about Cady being form Africa, and ask, ""So if you're from Africa, why are you white?"" You might be thinking, there really aren't that many stupid people in high school, but I can say from experience there can be even worse. The other thing that makes this dialog one to remember are the catchy one liners such as, ""She doesn't even go her!"", ""Stop trying to make fetch happen."", ""You can't sit with us!"", ""The limit does not exist!"" There is guaranteed to be a one-liner in the movie that can work for any situation in real life. But when I first heard there was going to be another movie about high school and a group of teenagers, I was very skeptical of how it would turn out. The only thought that popped into my head was this is going to be another movie just like High School Musical, one where everything about high school is fantasized and is focused on some couple falling in love. But Mean Girls gives a completely different twist on movies about high school. It focuses on the realities of high school, the cliques, chick fights, back stabbing and gossip. It wasn't some made up fantasy where nothing goes wrong, which I am just so sick of. Mean Girls does not hold back on any of the drama and gives you a real feel for what high school is really like, which for once, is a pleasant surprise.",Mean Girls
551,kvielha,Actor Choice,9,1 October 2014,"If you have never seen the movie Mean Girls, you are probably living under a rock. This comedy especially appeals to the teen girl audience, but this stroke of comic genius can be enjoyed by all genders and all ages. Mean Girls has some of the most quotable lines of all time and even ten years after its release is still watched regularly by many. I have yet to meet anyone who does not know that ""On Wednesdays we wear pink,"" or ""Get in loser. We're going shopping,"" are quotes from Mean Girls. Additionally, I believe that the actor choice in this film definitely pushed it to the success that it has seen.For those who have not seen this movie, first of all, you need to go watch it right this second. Secondly, this movie shows a teenage girl, Cady Heron, portrayed by Lindsay Lohan, as she enters a public high school after being home-schooled in Africa for her whole life. She is befriended by two outsiders and also by the school's ""mean girls,"" The Plastics. Cady attempts to sabotage the queen bee of The Plastics in order to revenge for her friend Janis, but she instead becomes a mean girl herself. Lohan's portrayal of Cady makes the movie. Her girl-next-door look and relatability makes her playing a naïve girl from Africa who could easily be manipulated seem believable. Next, I personally do not think that a better actor could have been chosen to play the queen bee, Regina George. Rachel McAdams' roles in other movies are drastically different than her character in this film, but to me it makes it interesting that she can be so versatile. I would never expect the same person who plays Allie in The Notebook to be able to pull off the bitchiness needed to play Regina, but McAdams did this with ease. However, many may not know that Lohan wanted to play Regina. The studio producing the film decided against Lohan in this role because ""after the success of Freaky Friday, Paramount felt that an audience would no longer accept Lohan as a villain."" I do not doubt that Lohan could have done a wonderful job in this role, but I do think that Paramount made the right casting choice in this situation. One of my favorite casting decisions was having Amanda Seyfried portray Karen Smith. Seyfried plays the role of the dumb blonde to a t. I think that Seyfried has some of the most underrated comic moments in the whole movie and I believe that her look and voice definitely contribute to this. In this film, Seyfried speaks at a slow pace and always seems confused which makes her actually seem dumb. Apparently, Seyfried was ""neck and neck for the role of Regina"" which shocks me. I do not see her being the queen bee and definitely think that her role as a not-so-intelligent minion suits her much better than the role of Regina would have. The last actor choice that I think deserves to be mentioned is Lohan's love interest, Aaron Samuels. Aaron is played by Jonathon Bennett in the film, but was not always the top choice for the role. According to an inside source, ""there was another actor playing Aaron Samuels at the dinner where the cast met"" who was later fired. James Franco was also seriously considered for the role. In my opinion, James Franco looks much too old to be playing a high schooler and could not have pulled this off. Bennett looks much more appropriate age-wise and is very attractive, so his looks definitely make sense that two of the most popular girls in the school could like him. Overall, if you have not yet seen this movie, even though I already told you to drop what you were doing and go watch it, then you need to see it. I promise you that you will not regret it and also you will actually know what people are talking about when you people reference the film. You will laugh out loud at some of the dumb things that Karen Smith says and you will want to kill Regina for some of her backstabbing actions. I do not care how old you are if you are a boy or a girl. You will enjoy this movie for one reason or another.",Mean Girls
552,pajo1298,"The comedy movie Mean Girls, directed by Mark S. Waters and written by Tina Fey, tells the story of 16-year-old Cady Heron who is a new student at Evanston High.",9,1 October 2014,"The comedy movie Mean Girls is a satire on high school life that sends messages to high school girls through the comedic elements in the film. Mean Girls ridicules high school life through the script and actions presented by the characters. Tina Fey, the writer of the movie, based the script off of a ""self-help book, Rosalind Wiseman's 2002 tome ""Queen Bees and Wannabes,"" written for moms to help their daughters survive the social cliques of teendom""(Susman). As the writer, Fey uses satire to mock the high school social structure. By having Cady as the main character, Fey expresses the outrageousness of high school customs through Cady's reactions because ""the conduct of American high school kids is totally foreign to her"" (Mitchell). Cady's adjustment to high school in the beginning of the movie shows how bizarre our high school customs are. For example, when Cady comes home from her second day of school her parents ask,""How was your second day? /Fine/ Were people nice? /No/ Did you make any friends?/Yeah""(Mean Girls). Through this conversation, Fey shows the humor in that Cady has ""friends,"" but she says they are not nice to her. Would you consider someone who is not nice to you to be your friend?In the movie, Cady frequently relates the behavior of high school students to the behavior of wild animals. For example, when Cady is at the mall near the fountain, she has a daydream that all the kids sitting around the fountain are running like wild animals around a watering hole. This is just her imagination, but this is a predecessor to a scene later in the movie when all the girls find out about the entries in ""The Burn Book."" The girls' behavior is absolutely insane. They are tackling each other, hitting each other, and calling each other names. At this point, Cady says in her head ""it was full-tilt jungle madness and it wasn't going away."" Comparing high school life to a jungle takes a satirical look at how wild and crazy high school can be. This scene mocks the behavior of high school kids and compares their behavior to that of wild animals. As Cady carries out her plan to crack Regina's army, Cady convinces Gretchen that Regina hates her, and ""the meaner Regina was to her, the more Gretchen tried to win Regina back. She knew it was better to be in the plastics, hating life, than to not be in at all"" (Mean Girls). The quote is funny, but also has an element of truth to it. The quote shows that girls will trade happiness for social standing, which seems absolutely ridiculous, but is fairly common in high school. By the end of the movie, Cady, a dynamic character, realizes the harm she has done in pretending to be one of the plastics and how she has hurt some of the people closest to her. Cady explains, ""Calling somebody else fat won't make you any skinnier. Calling someone stupid doesn't make you any smarter. And ruining Regina George's life definitely didn't make me any happier. All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.""(Mean Girls). Cady realizes that tearing other people down does not make her feel better: it only makes her a mean person. She also realizes that she changed herself to fit in. Cady transformed from a naïve conscientious student to a self absorbed, lying diva who even pretended to be dumb to get a guy's attention. In the movie, Cady recognizes that she changed to be someone she was not; too often, high school students spend all of high school being some one they are not, and only realizing after high school that they were not themselves. Although classified as in the comedy genre, Mean Girls has underlying messages that high school students can apply to their own lives.",Mean Girls
553,mzimmerman2014,Mean Girls is great!,10,8 October 2014,"Mean Girls is one of the most popular teen movies of our generation. Tina Fey's screenplay captures the life of Cady Heron who recently came to public school after being home-schooled in Africa. Her encounters with the school ""mean girls"", The Plastics, fuel the movie's chick-flick factor. With the popularity of the movie now (admit it, you've probably heard ""you can't sit with us"" one too many times in high school) you would think that the movie's success began in the box office. Sadly, the movie only made an estimated $17,000,000 in the box office, not even reaching the list of the top grossing movies in the United States. Its box office flop can be due to a number of factors; one being the movie only had one trailer (not advertising the BEST parts of the movie). The movie's quotable one-liners and all-star cast induce hilarity upon the audience. Capturing the stereotypical high school setting (in a hilariously dramatic way) makes this movie a must-watch. It definitely didn't get enough credit in the box office for the greatness that the movie holds.

When she finally fell into the crowd, she was tossed out like the local newspaper. Cady met a group of popular girls, Regina George (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert), and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). The groups were given the name ""The Plastics"" because everyone assumed they were perfect. Cady also met 2 other friends that were not has perfect, Janice Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and Damien (Daniel Franzese). The two combos wanted to destroy the Plastics, so they took Cady under their wing but their plan did not play how they had ultimately hoped. The film has its high school gossip, boy crushes, secret spills, betrayal and the popular and not-so-popular. The movie is great for laughs and cries in the never ending drama film ""Mean Girls''.The purpose of my review is to inform anyone that has not yet seen ""Mean Girls"" should take the investment and rent the film. The movie was created in 2004, so anyone can guess that it is no longer in the theater's. I believe this film is a classic and you can find it at any movie renting store or simply find it on Netflix. The acting in ""Mean Girls'' was exquisite. The film had the basics in a high school drama. The main character is Cady Heron, played by MTV movie award winning Lindsay Lohan. She was a great fit because she was youthful and portrayed the typical high school girl. Fitting in or the feeling of belonging is what the movie is about. The scenery was great because it replicated a small town with one main school and the who's who of the city. The actors played their roles exceptionally well and had you believe they were talking to the audience and made you feel a part of the film. The director, Mark Waters, knew how to create the movie to relate to its viewers. The audience could be a host of different generations but more geared towards teenagers. ""Mean Girls"" is a film that relates to parents when they were younger and flashbacks of how it felt to be young again in high school. The actors were truly engaged and portrayed great skill and endurance. The director got his meaning and moral of the story across because we were not unsure at the end of the film. The movements and blocking in the film went natural and it did not seem as if I was watching a television movie, it felt more real-time. The film made me believe I was relating to the scenes and situations that were happening. The classic drama ""Mean Girls"" a high school junior has never been exposed to the reality of being in a public school. She was raised in Africa, and soon was exposed to the world of teenage drama. Director Mark Waters created the film and captured the essence of teen life. The scene changing flowed naturally and dialogue carried on well throughout the film. All in all, I believe every family should see ""Mean Girls"" is a great movie and recommend it for anyone.",Mean Girls

Lohan and Mcadams make a great duet in a movie and i hope that in the future they make another movie together.I really enjoyed watching this movie because it really shows how girls can ruin each others lives by making one phone call or letting out one secret. But if the film industry finds that more of these movies are coming out, girls are going to use movies like that as examples and parents are going to be really upset that rumors of their child are going around their school and that your daughter is making stuff up about other people.

557,valeriaalvarez,Highly Recommend!,7,6 November 2015,"When I first saw Mean Girls, I thought it was going to be another horribly written teen movie. Normally these include a group of stereotypical popular mean girls, a vulnerable teen who wants to fit in, and a happy ending. In a way, this was a typical teen movie, but the story line will hit home for many people in high school.Cady starts her junior year of public high school after being homeschooled for her whole life. On the first day, she meets Janice and Damian, a couple of outcasts that decide to take Cady under their wing. They start to tell her all about the groups of people in the school and then they introduce the plastics. The leader of the plastics, Regina George, approaches Cady one day at lunch and asks her to join them. Hesitant, Cady says yes and joins their group with intentions to find out all their secrets and share them with Janice and Damian. She finds out about their ""Burn Book"" they have, which is full of gossip and rumors from everyone at school. After this, the plastics begin to mold Cady into one of them. One weekend, they decide to go to a halloween party and Cady sees a boy from her Calculous class that she has a crush on. His name is Aaron and he's Regina's ex boyfriend. Cady had told Regina that she thought he was cute and to help her out by talking to him. At the party, Regina started to kiss Aaron knowing Cady likes him because she wasn't over him. When Cady sees this, she sets up a plan to ruin Regina George's life with the help of Janice and Damian. She gives Regina ""weight loss"" bars that actually made her gain weight and it caused her popular downfall. When she finds out that Cady sabotaged her, she makes an entry about herself in the burn book and turns it into the principal's office, blaming Cady and the plastics. While they're in the principal's office, Regina makes copies of the burn book and spreads them all throughout the school. This starts a war between all of the girls at the school and Cady confesses that it was her who wrote the burn book. She's shunned by the school and while she's arguing with Regina about the book, Regina gets hit by a bus and gets injured. At the spring dance, Cady wins queen and gives a speech about how this was all just a popularity contest and everyone should be treated equal. This is the part where it's so stereotypical and everyone forgives her and after that, there were no more cliques in that high school.Mean Girls is an exaggerated version of high school, but there are some parts where it's accurate. Most high schools will have a group of bullies who live for picking on others. Many will get bullied for their looks or because they don't fit in. The movie sends a good message about treating others equally in the end. I recommend watching this movie if you haven't. It's become an iconic movie, with quotes all over the internet and having it referred to in everyday conversations.",Mean Girls

She'd screw you over in a heartbeat if you stepped on her turf, but the nonthreatening Gretchen is allowed some reward for loyalty. Gretchen herself, played by the delectable Lacey Chabert is a character of her own, not just a cardboard minion to follow orders. Neurotic, shallow, desperate, beautiful, loyal and rather uncertain she is perhaps the saddest and most sympathetic of the Plastics - a girl who certainly has the looks and money to make it to the top of the pyramid but who lacked the will or the certainty. Not a problem with Karen (Amanda Seyfried) who has an admirable certainty of herself and her abilities. In one of the films best lines after a telling off from Regina, Cady tries to comfort her: Cady: You're not stupid, Karen.To which Karen replies thoughtfully (without a hint of bitterness or anger): Karen: No, I am, actually. I'm failing everything.Indeed she is. Karen is an airhead, and if not actively proud of it, at least accepting. She doesn't seem cruel herself, possibly because she is simply too shallow and dense, but she doesn't seem a bad person. Which for the second minion (Gretchen outranks her) to the villainous is quite a remarkable achievement.Finally I must mention Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese as Janice and Damian respectively, the outsiders we are rooting for, in theory. They do good work, though I found them slightly dry next to the endlessly dysfunctional Plastics (though that may be something to do with me finding Lacey Chabert much more attractive than Daniel Franzese!) Overall a very good piece of work from all concerned. If you like teen movies then you'll find this a very good one. If you don't, well hold your nose and try it anyway, you might be pleasantly surprised!",Mean Girls

560,kettleborough,Mean Girls,8,23 February 2016,"Being a highly intelligent girl in a brand new school, in a different country isn't the most ideal situation for a teenager. For Cady Heron (Lindsey Lohan), this was a big slap in the face as she was previously home-schooled in Africa before her father received a job opportunity in the United States. Soon enough, Cady becomes well educated on the different varieties of cliques a typical high school has to offer – jocks, cheerleaders, mathletes, and the group Cady finds herself soon apart of is ""the Plastics,"" also known as your typical popular girl group. Regina George (Rachel McAdams) plays the manipulative leader of the Plastics, along with her blind-sighted followers Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert), and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). Cady, with the help from her emo friend Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and ""too gay to function"" friend Damien (Daniel Franzese), spies on this manipulative, evil group and attempts to quickly end their high school wrath, but everything takes a turn when she realizes she was becoming the next Regina George. Mean Girls written by Tina Fey, who also plays Ms. Norbury the high school math teacher in the movie, brilliantly describes how social cliques in high schools can have long lasting, damaging effects on individuals physically and emotionally. The movie very well depicts the nonfictional book it was based on, Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman. Not only did Fey write the plot of the movie based on this nonfictional book, but also from her very own awkward and drama filled high school years which makes the movie that more meaningful. As for the director of the movie, Mark S. Waters, he picked a lot of cliché high school events and decisions for the movie. The typical crush that Cady gets on Aaron (Jonathan Bennet) from her math class, and pretends her intelligent mind knows nothing just to get some alone ""tutoring"" time from the guy. Or also another typical scene when Cady's parents are out of town, so she throws a party at the house and a bunch of underage high school students drink an unreasonable amount of beer and liquor. There definitely could have been some more creativeness in choice of high school activities. But to give credit where needed, the prom scene when Cady gives pieces of her Prom Queen crown to just about everyone shows that there is some closure of ""the Plastics"" which I thought was a brilliant touch to end the movie. To set aside the writer, and director of this movie for a moment we have to focus on the main actor in this comedy, Lohan. Beside the fact that we all think of Lohan now as a relapsing junkie, we have to admit she killed this role as Cady Heron. The confidence and emotion she brought to this character is what made the movie come alive. Being that she was only 17 at the time this movie was filmed, she really showed her drive and determination to help make this film a success and really prove to the movie industry what she could really do. This movie may leave teenagers wondering why their high school doesn't have nearly as much gossip and drama, but that's a typical high school movie –full of cliché cliques that are actually non-existent to this world. But a couple things they may leave with continuing thoughts and life lessons on is that you probably shouldn't give your enemy protein bars that make her gain weight, or throw your ""best friend"" into a bus, because odds are you will get in some sort of major trouble and the entire school might hate your guts after wards –or love you for doing what they never could.",Mean Girls

562,laquariussmith,Mean Girls was a huge disappointment from what was expected of it and could have been much better.,3,12 October 2016,"Mean Girls is a ridiculous excuse for a film that makes teenage girls look like sex symbols, over exaggerates high school trends, and sets a bad example for youths. To be considered a four- star drama goes to show how sick and perverted the young adult audience actually is. Although the message behind the movie was exceptionally inspiring, the way the director and producer delivers it is wrong and needs to be reassessed. ***This passage may contain spoilers*** Actor Lindsey Lohan plays an innocent African newbie, Cady, who enters an American high school thinking everything and everyone will be nice. She's in for a surprise when she meets popular girl Regina George –who's played by actress Rachel McAdams– and her two so-called best friends (played by Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried). Cady instantly wants to fit in with them and in the process forgets who she is. After going through her fair share of tests and judgment, she ends up at the top of the popularity chain, knocks Regina right out of her place as queen, and wins the hot boyfriend (played by actor Jonathan Bennett), but everything goes crashing down when Cady turns into the very person she was trying to destroy. She goes on a mission for redemption and finds herself again while also finding a common ground with Regina George and everyone she betrayed. So, it's safe to say that the movie sounds like an ideal film for teens and conveys an important lesson that's supported by a clean script, female role models, and realistic high school situations, right? Wrong.Director Mark Waters obviously didn't care what type of message this movie actually would be sending to young girls and boys. The way the actresses dress and act tells the younger audience that it's okay to be mean as long as you're having fun and that dressing in short, tight clothing is sexy even if you subconsciously don't want to do it but want attention. Fitting in is more important than being who you really are. Mark tries to throw in some scenes where Cady takes part in the math club, but who actually pays attention to that part? It's not only bad for girls but it also teaches young boys with raging hormones that the sexiest girls are the ones who dress like up and coming playboys. Forget the girls with brains. Even worse than that, the high school these four girls go to has little to no boundaries, no dress code, and no concern for the level of sexual conduct or drugs and alcohol going on. What high school in America is this lenient? The fact that its PG-13 isn't going to keep the wrong audience form watching either. The message of just being yourself is overshadowed with sex, alcohol, and the importance of popularity. Sure, high school does have a lot of this going on, but this movie makes it seem worse than it actually is, especially considering Mark didn't even show that there was anything wrong with it knowing that there are kids that watch it. One could argue that it's not the director's responsibility to worry about what children watch or that how much money he made is more important than kids growing up to be wild, young adults. Forget graduating high school as long as you have fun! Most people look at this film like a harmless comedy, but how funny will it be when innocent little Karen from down the street turns into trashy Bree Bree on the pole? While Mean Girls does have an important lesson behind it, the fact that it's more about hot, dumb girls and their popularity ruins it. Instead, it focuses on how fun high school can be when the rules are broken and all you do is worry about your school status and party. I give this film two stars for its inspirational message and one for making me laugh at how dumb it was.",Mean Girls
563,janelbenton,One of the Top Three Teen Movies Ever,10,12 October 2016,"Mean Girls is a wonderful teen comedy written by Tina Fey and directed by Mark Waters. This movie set the bar for future teen movies and has been a milestone in pop culture. Lindsay Lohan steals the show as she plays ,Cady Heron, a home schooled girl from Africa whose parents are zoologist. Her and her parents moved to a suburban neighborhood in Illinois and had to adjust to going to a public school for the first time. She has to adjust to a few things such as, having to ask to go to the restroom, reading ahead, and not sitting in her assign seat. On her first day of school she met two art fanatics, Janis Ian(Lizzy Caplan) a goth girl ,and Damian (Daniel Franzeese), a gay guy who is almost ""Too gay to function"" who gives her the insight about the people in school and the different cliques. They especially notified her about the total of girls called the plastics. Regina George is the queen bee of Northshore High and the leader of the plastics. Her minions Gretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert) a preppy rich girl whose father invented the toaster strudel, and Karen Smith(Amanda Seyfried) the dumb blonde of the group, but she has a couple of bright moments sometimes. The plastics are the most popular girls and has so many rules to be in. Karen Smith: "" On Wednesdays we wear pink."" One of the best scenes and lines in the movie is when the Coach Carr teaches about sex. Coach Carr: ""Don't have sex. Because you will get pregnant. And die."" Tina Fey plays Cady's humorous calculus teacher who dresses horribly ,but gives her good advice on focusing on her studies. Tina Fey plays Cady's humorous calculus teacher who dresses horribly ,but gives her good advice on focusing on her studies. Just like any normal high school teenagers want to fit in and once Cady started hanging around the plastics she started acting like them. Cady had became the new Regina and enjoying all of the attention she had received even if that meant leaving her loyal friends behind. Another hilarious scene is when all of the girls do an exercise and apologize to all of the people they have hurt and offended. In this scene Gretchen gets up and apologizes, ""I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me... but I can't help it that I'm so popular."" Mean Girls takes a normal cliché and totally change the game by mimicking teenagers, but also teaching life lessons. It shows how you should never try to be someone else to be popular. I feel like any teenager, including me, can relate with feeling left out. That's what I love about the movie it gives you every aspect that you need. Mean Girls has made a mark in history and in the 21st century as one if not best teenage movie of all time. This is so effective that if you said a line from it, you would know exactly where it came from. I think this movie is perfect just the way it is. From the cast, script, and the production the whole thing is just legendary. I think this movie is absolutely perfect the way it is the directors couldn't have done anything else to it. If you have not seen this movie you are really missing out.",Mean Girls

When I first saw the trailer for Mean Girls, I wasn't that interested. So when it came out on DVD my step dad and I went to blockbuster to rent it. My friends were telling me how that movie was so good, I decided to watch it. When I got home I swear I watched that movie over and over till 1 am! I invited my friend over to watch it with me and we had so much fun, heck I even watched that movie with my grandma and she loved it. We keep on doing quotes from the movies at school ""So if you're from Africa, why are you white?"" Mean Girls is a prefect girls night out movie for teens.This movie is about a 15 year old girl named Cady (Lindsay Lohan) who just moved from Africa and has to start high school. On the second day of school The Plastics (Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried) ask Cady to hang out with them, but when Cady falls in love with Regina's ex boyfriend, Regina wants revenge. Now all that Cady and her friends Janis and Damian (Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese) are thinking about is sabotage! With all of this madness going on will The Plastics stay together, will Cady go out with Aaron Samuels, or will it just be madness forever?",Mean Girls
567,tom_sto86,So Fetch,10,16 February 2006,"Mean Girls isn't your average teen comedy, which you can tell are written by adults who have no insight into the social politics that revolve around teenage life, and who consequently divide everyone into two groups - cool (jocks and cheerleaders) and uncool (goths and science nerds). And it is this inherent understanding of teen life, that writer Tina Fey has applied to the film which makes it stand out, and such a pleasure to watch.Cady Herron (played by Lindsay Lohan) is starting her first day of school - and she's 16. She's been home-schooled all her life (in Africa), and is totally unprepared for and untutored in the ways of an American high school. She quickly befriends Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian (Daniel Franzese), two of the biggest social outcasts in school. However, after a chance encounter in the canteen with the plastics (teen royalty), otherwise known as Regina George (Rachel Macadams), Gretched Wieners (Lacey Chabert) and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried), Cady's world begins to change dramatically as she is sucked in by the rules and cliques of Girlworld.The dialogue in the film is sharp and witty, not the OTT Dawson's Creek or O.C. teen-speak. The teenagers actually look like teenagers, not like 30 year olds playing teenagers. And what holds the film together are the great performances from the actors. They're all perfect. Lindsay Lohan is perfect as Cady, the clueless girl who gets a taste of popularity and has to have more. Lizzy Caplan is a revelation as Janis, a punk character who would be sidelined either as a freak, or as a candidate for a makeover, in any other teen movie. But it is the actresses who play the plastics who truly stand out. Lacey Chabert is ideal as Gretchen, the insecure, 2nd-in command girl, who fakes her friendship with Regina just to be considered popular. Amanda Seyfried, as the ultimate dumb blonde Karen, has impeccable comic timing. And rising Hollywood star Rachel Macadams, as Regina George, is the stand-out in the film as the manipulative bitch who has to stay on top at all costs.Mean Girls isn't just a film for teen girls and gay guys. Most of my (straight) male friends love it, and everyone I know who's seen it recognises elements of the film and the characters from their own secondary school experiences. Mean Girls is, as Gretchen would say (in keeping with ""British"" slang, even though I'm English and the term just doesn't exist!), that the film is just So Fetch.",Mean Girls

Janis tells Cady all about Regina George (Rachel McAdams) the queen-bee and star as Damian puts it, and her two little workers, the very rich and popular Gretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert) and dim-witted but very sweet Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried) and tells her to quote on quote ""beware of the plastics"" after giving her a lunch-time guide. Well, to cut a long story short, Cady befriends the 3 popular but manipulative teens after Janis tells her to quote on quote ""spy"" on them. However, when Cady falls for Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennet) she is stung, and now tries to ruin Cady's social life, while at the sane time trying to ruin HER life. In conclusion, after alo t of serious events with the burn book, and Mrs.George (Amy Poehler) Regina's cool 😉 mom, the principal (Tim Meadows) decides to go ahead and give Cady a punishment, making ""girl world"" at peace again.I am absolutely OBSESSED with this movie, Lindsay Lohan did such a great job portraying the main Cady Heron, as well as Rachel McAdams who played the queen bee herself because you have to have a nice girl to play a mean girl, which was VERY convincing. Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried did such a great job too portraying their characters, and for Seyfried's feature film debut, well let's just say... it made her a really big break-out star, i also love the addition of the SNL characters such as Fey, Poehler, Tim Meadows, and Ana Gasteyer who played Cady's mom.Some of the stuff that interested me in this film was that Rachel McAdams was only 7 years younger than Amy Poehler, and 8 years older than Lohan, but i love how they managed to have her play a high school student and still make it work.In conclusion, i recommend this movie to any teenage girls, or just anyone who LOVES teenage films, cause out of all the teen films (chick flicks as i like to call them) but this one takes the cake.",Mean Girls

So when I watched it, it came as a surprise when i saw it and realized it was complete and utter garbage. I mean like the whole thing is some stupid story about some girl that really gives you no reason to care for you, and then she goes to a high school but she has been in home schooling for her whole life. So she finds it hard, just like you would expect from a mediocre film, and then she becomes friends with the weird losers, but she is pretty so she gets to hangout with the,"" Popular, pretty girls"" and then she uses it to get at them, but then ends up becoming a bitch like them, and she then gets a crush on a guy the other girl wants, and they fight about it.

The popular girls, and the ""outcasts"". *sigh* Not only does it send a positive message out there to young girls (who often find out the lesson way after high school) it has many comedic incidents, but to a point to where there is still truth and the moral of the story is clearly known. Being Ms. Perfect, it seems that Regina George is the perfect personification of the ""evil"" in all girls, while still sugar coating her outsides to make the entire school worship her--something only a few can master. Throughout Janis Ian's plot of revenge, viewers see that it's not only the popular, pretty, perfect girls who can be mean.

Then she'd befriended two pretty memorable characters Janice and Damien. Look at this, she ends up meeting the three most popular girls in school Regina George, Gretchen Wieners & Karan Smith. And somewhat discover for her own self yes she's a grade A hottie. And if you haven't seen it already I won't spoil the rest but that's basically the first 5 to 10 minutes at the movie.
