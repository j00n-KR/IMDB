0,TheLittleSongbird,Very likable horror adventure.,7,8 September 2009,"The Mummy is a fun and likable horror adventure, that doesn't take itself too seriously. True, there are a few discrepancies in the script, it is a tad overlong and Kevin J.Connor's Beni mayn't be to everyone's tastes, but it is a solid film of its genre. The visuals are absolutely stunning, every scene with the Egyptian desert is enough to take your breath away, and the costumes are very nice too. The music by the one and only Jerry Goldsmith is a very creepy and atmospheric score, and just goes to show what a talented composer Goldsmith was. I will admit some of it is quite scary, and that is an understatement, I do confess being scared of the film when I saw it for the first time when I was 9(I'm 17 now), and there are some scenes that still scare me now. It is no wonder because Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep was a masterstroke, very, very frightening at times, especially when the Mummy disguises himself on the ship, and takes off his cloak to claim his first victim. The other performances are fine, with a dashing Brendan Fraser and a stunningly beautiful Rschel Weisz. John Hannah, if you forgive his accent, was on the whole fine. Overall, a fun and likable horror adventure, flawed yes, but guaranteed to give you entertainment and perhaps nightmares. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Mummy
1,Leofwine_draca,CGI roller-coaster ride for kids,4,30 August 2016,"As the latest overblown big-budget remake hits our cinema screens, once again I despair at the direction Hollywood is taking. If it's not making cheap, sentimental dross, then more likely than not the new offering will be a film full of CGI effects and nothing else. And THE MUMMY falls into this latter category amiably enough, not being bad enough for me to rant on endlessly about the faults, just being boringly average and entertaining enough on a superficial level for me to moan about the state of the world these days.Forget about the original MUMMY film for a start, as it had Boris Karloff in it. Karloff was an actor. A real, true, actor. Sadly there is little acting in this film, and what there is instead is atrocious comedy filler which is recycled and totally lame in concept. The 'actors' are required to run around and react to various pyrotechnic or computer generated effects, and that's exactly it. There is little plot, with the film merely being a string of action sequences, so many that it's hard to label this film horror at all.The 12 certificate means there is virtually no blood in the film, so the deaths are not very good, and those which are left to the imagination are the most effective. A variation on the black slime from THE X-FILES turns up in the form of a flesh-burrowing scarab beetle in an amusing scene, but the effects of the beetles never look for a moment convincing - they look like exactly what they are, computer graphics. The ten plagues are understated (a fountain runs red to show 'rivers running with blood' - talk about disappointing) and merely an excuse for more special effects, briefly done. The action scenes are probably the best thing the film has to offer, and Fraser leaping about firing two handguns is enjoyable enough.Unfortunately, the mummy itself is most disappointing. The original form is fine, but then some idiot had to give it eyes and a tongue so it could talk, ruining the effect. The mummy makes scary faces like it's in a Disney film, so that also ruins any frights there might have been. It's just ludicrous and downright embarrassing. The regeneration moments are okay, but Arnold Vosloo is not exactly a frightening person, and his naked torso and eye make up just make him look like a drag queen in his/her finest silk dressing gown.Which leads me on to the acting. Rachel Weisz is a bad actress and therefore well suited to this film, she fits in nicely. Worst of all she's British, and her grating accent soon becomes apparent. Look, nobody speaks English like this and the portrayal borders on stereotypical. John Hannah is a bit better as a timid, weak coward type, and to be fair I found myself liking him. Brendan Fraser is also okay as the brainless Indiana Jones-type explorer, and he's good in the action scenes. The rest of the characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes and not worth bothering with. The special effects are pretty bad, with Vosloo's stretchy jaw being the worst offender. Gosh, it's ridiculously bad! The beetles are fake, and only the sand faces are effective. Stephen Sommers, with this and DEEP RISING, shows himself to be a competent director, but I only wish he could get better material and steer himself away from these FX-filled bloaters. Then perhaps he might make something interesting. THE MUMMY is a bit enjoyable in a loud, superficial, disengage the brain kind of way, but otherwise it's sorely disappointing, much as you would expect from Hollywood these days. And something of an embarrassment all round. And this was a hit? What's the world coming to?",The Mummy
2,SnoopyStyle,Fun,8,20 September 2013,"Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) wants to start an archaeological dig at the ancient city of Hamunaptra. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is arrested for stealing but was rescued by Evelyn. Together along with her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), they are racing with another group of explorers. Unfortunately for everyone, the curse of the Mummy is unleashed.Brendan Fraser is having a lot fun playing this Indiana Jones like character. And he has fun chemistry with Rachel Weisz. They have a great back and forth. The adventure is again fun. That's the key word for this film, fun.",The Mummy
3,Hitchcoc,A Lot of Sand,7,18 May 1999,"Wow, 250 people have commented on this movie already. What can I say to add to their many comments. I guess first of all, ""Who is this mummy, and why has he been granted so much power?"" For a guy who is a common adulterer, how has he accumulated enough points to get to be such a big shot. Why does he look like a masking tape version of the morphing creature in Terminator II. Why are there cowboys in this movie? Why does Brendan Fraser look like George of the Jungle after being in prison for two years. How does he keep coming back after being hit with a stick in the kidneys. Why does everyone know where the mummy is and where that gold book is. How do they commute from Cairo back and forth to the secret city (is that the one with the Casino out front)? Ooh! The secret city. What a secret. Why didn't someone dig this stuff up about 200 years ago. Oh, that's right, there was a map, wasn't there, but the cowboys have the map too. Where did they get that. There must be two maps. Then. of course, there is the mummy's mouth. Do you remember anything about mummy's having large mouths. Why does everyone who isn't alive have a large mouth? Why did they put the princess's body parts in the jars. What would have happened if someone had just blown away a couple of those jars. Where did that guy get the job guarding the secret city, and why is he so lousy at it? Why are those bugs there? What do they eat when they're just waiting around for tourists to show up at the secret city. How do you kill the dead--and do you really want to? Who is the mummy scared of--is it those same guys that came up and got the bad guys in ""Ghost?"" Why does Brendan Frazier get a couple of years in prison for killing about 600 Egyptians. I don't know--I have to say that if I watched this and never asked myself any questions, it's just silly enough to entertain--my son liked it and I respect his sense of joy. There are certainly a lot of things jumping out and hands touching shoulders during tense scenes. I know this whole thing is tongue in cheek and is supposed to mimic the 1940's B movies, but with a little more imagination it could have done this and been a pretty cool movie! Perhaps they could have even added a little suspense!",The Mummy
4,mark.waltz,Everybody loved their mummy!,7,28 May 2016,"Practically every classic film utilizing a theme of ancient Egypt or the invasion of their fabulous temples has been lovingly ripped off and spoofed in this completely delightful sword and sandals adventure. Starting off much like the 1932 Karloff horror film and its Hammer remake, it takes on a non-stop ride into comedy and adventure as the scenario moves from the ancient setting flashbacks to the 1920's. Old Maria Montez camp favorites are joined together with the many comedy spoofs of the genre, whether it be Wheeler and Woolsey's ""Mummy's Boys"" or ""Abbot and Costello Meet the Mummy"". There's even a bit of ""Land of the Pharaohs"" as the giant tomb closes up just as it had for Joan Collins in that 1955 camp classic.You will be happy to know that this is completely family friendly with little to give nightmares even though there are some insinuations of horrific things taking place off camera. Perhaps the only thing that might give some viewers the heeby- jeeby's are the flesh eating bugs, but nothing is shown, only implied. Universal remade several of their classic horror films, and while this isn't the modern classic of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", it makes up for the over-done ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"".The always refreshing Brendan Fraser may be a poor man's Indiana Jones to some, but he is a charming and irresistible rogue who is rescued from hanging by Egyptologist Rachel Weisz , agreeing to escort her to the valley of the kings where she intends to find the valuable treasures dating back to the reign of Pharaoh Seti I. Unbeknownst to them, the mummy awaits, cursed to the worst fate after murdering the Pharaoh after seducing his wife. The torment that he faces is nothing compared to what the invaders of his tomb will endure.This moves by at a speedy pace thanks to the often Three Stooges style comedy. Mixing old style Saturday matinée fun with modern technology works wonders to keep this afloat, and it is a film lover's dream for good old fashioned thrills mixed with updated styles. Nothing to really criticize here even with a few clichés here and there. Some of the highlights include a chase between a giant moving walk of sand (complete with mummy face) and the small aircraft piloted by veteran character actor Bernard Fox, and the march of Pharaoh's mummy guards who only seem to be missing the ""March of the Winkies"" theme from ""The Wizard of Oz"". This is one of the rare occasions where I look forward to the sequel, if not the remake due in 2017.",The Mummy
5,classicsoncall,"""I only gamble with my life, never my money!""",7,16 September 2019,"I saw this movie upon original release and not again till the other day, and I'd forgotten how much fun the whole thing was. And how gorgeous actress Patricia Velasquez was in the role of Anck Su Namun, wife of the Pharoah but lover of the High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo). She really should have had a much larger role. What I did recall was all the great CGI effects with the shifting and shape forming desert sands, along with the mummy effects when Imhotep was brought back to life. The principal players all shared a well defined chemistry, and I liked the low key humor of the often outmatched brother Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah). Interestingly, the movie retained a lot of the Boris Karloff original from 1932, maintaining many of the same characters and story elements. The only thing I wish movies like this would do a better job of is identifying all of it's principal characters. For example, if the tattooed Arab leader Ardeth Bey's (Oded Fehr) name was mentioned, I didn't catch it. It's a little thing, but would prevent one from wondering who the heck the guy is that has such a large role in the story. Be that as it may, you could have a good time with this picture when in the right frame of mind. Maybe not so for impressionable young kids who might be scared by the walking mummy corpses; you might have to hold them off for a while.",The Mummy
6,gavin6942,A Surprisingly Decent Reboot / Remake,7,29 July 2016,"An American (Brendan Fraser) serving in the French Foreign Legion on an archaeological dig at the ancient city of Hamunaptra accidentally awakens a mummy.To call this a remake of the 1932 film is a bit of a stretch. Some bare bones elements are the same, but where the original was a horror film, this is really an action-adventure film with some horror elements thrown in. What is most fascinating is the long list of hands it went through: Wes Craven, Joe Dante, Clive Barker, George Romero, Mick Garris... one can only imagine how different people would have tackled the film.What we end up with is really more of an Indiana Jones vs. the Undead sort of story. And while it may not be the most intellectual film, and some of the CGI is clearly rushed, it is a fun flick. It should come as no surprise that they've made three sequels (and already planning a 2017 reboot).",The Mummy
7,lee_eisenberg,Well wrap me up!,7,17 January 2006,"OK, everyone knows the drill: in ancient Egypt, high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) was buried alive for trying to resurrect a princess, and 3,000 years later, some brainless explorers accidentally resurrect Imhotep, who has an axe to grind. An interesting aspect here is the usage of the ancient Egyptian language. In a way, it seems a little silly casting Brendan Fraser as hero Rick O'Connell, given that he previously starred in movies like ""Encino Man"" and ""Airheads"". But he does some good work with the role. Rachel Weisz, as Evelyn Carnahan, doesn't exactly overshadow him, but has her own role in everything. John Hannah, as Evelyn's goofy brother Jonathan, is mostly there for comic relief. Oded Fehr, as Ardeth Bey, starts out looking like a bad guy, but turns out to be a good guy. All in all, corny but fun.One more thing. Is the Bernard Fox here the same Bernard Fox who played Dr. Bombay on ""Bewitched""?",The Mummy
8,jboothmillard,The Mummy,5,23 June 2005,"I assume this is a remake of the Boris Karloff or Christopher Lee films, with a clone of Indiana Jones and some familiar faces, from director Stephen Sommers. The film begins with the love story between High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) and Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez) broken by murder of the Egyptian king, and their deaths. Then it is 1923, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) fighting in the French Foreign Legion along with treacherous Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Connor) is hired by Egyptologist Evelyn ""Evie"" Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah) to lead them to the city of Hamunaptra after finding an ancient map and key. They get there, along with another team, including Dr. Allen Chamberlain (Titanic's Jonathan Hyde), Mr. Henderson (Stephen Dunham), Mr. Daniels (Corey Johnson) and Mr. Burns (Tuc Watkins). The bad news is that after reading part of the ""treasure"", The Book of the Dead, ""Evie"" releases the Mummy of Imhotep, and he will not stop till he has all jars containing the organs of his love, and from the people who have them getting their energy (skin). When he gets all his skin and jars, he is now the ultimate curse on the world, and unless Rick, Jonathan and knowledgeable Medjai Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) can stop him, he will sacrifice Evie to bring his love back to life. Also starring Erick Avari as Dr. Terrence Bey, Omid Djalili as Warden and Titanic's Bernard Fox as Captain Winston Havlock. The story may be cheesy, but the special effects, including the Mummy, the scarabs and the curses on Egypt are cool. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Rachel Weisz was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses. Worth watching!",The Mummy
9,ccthemovieman-1,"Bit Overlong, But Still The Word Is 'Fun'",8,1 April 2006,"It seems like a long time ago when this came out, but I remember it being the first DVD I had ever bought sight unseen, meaning I had never seen the film in the theater. I was pleased. I got what I had hoped for: a fun, special-effects extravaganza. In fact, if you read a number of reviews, you see the word ""fun"" more than anything. That best describes this film.This was an Indiana Jones-Jason And The Argonauts combination adventure story. It's cartoon-like in nature with an absurd swashbuckling hero, outlandish action scenes and the occult theology that filmmakers love so much. (The Mummy has God-like powers, even producing Old Testament plagues.)However, the film isn't all good news. It's too long by about 10-15 minutes and there is simply too much action and too much noise. The film needs more lulls.Brendan Fraser is pretty good as the Indiana Jones figure and Rachel Weisz, a new face at the time, makes a solid impression in her debut. The DVD offered a sharp picture which highlighted a number of jaw-dropping scenes. It's pure escapist fun and not meant to be anything else.",The Mummy
10,Tweekums,A fun adventure,8,13 July 2016,"In the prologue; we high priest Imhotep is having an affair with the Pharaoh's mistress; he catches them but the pair murder him. Shortly afterwards they are caught; she takes her own life but Imhotep isn't so lucky; he is condemned to the worst punishment imaginable; he interred with hundreds of scarabs which eat him alive. His sarcophagus is buried beneath a statue in the city of Hamunaptra; the city of the dead.Three thousand years later in 1925, long after Hamunaptra has disappeared into the sands and become almost mythical, American adventurer Rick O'Connell finds it once again. Back in Cairo Jonathan Carnahan gives a strange box to his sister Evelyn; it contains a map to the location of Hamunaptra. It turns out he's stolen it from Rick who is now in gaol awaiting execution! Needing his help Evelyn and Jonathan buy his release and they head to Hamunaptra. They aren't the only people going there though; a group of American treasure hunters have learnt of its location as well. What none of them know it that Imhotep is still there waiting for somebody to release him from his grave. Once released he will be a treat to all the world!Given that this film is rated '15' here I assumed it would be a bit more gory or contain other offensive material but to be honest I thought it was less scary than the 'PG' rated 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' it might frighten younger children but I'd say it was suitable for everybody else looking for an exciting adventure/monster movie. The story is simple enough, without unnecessary twists and the monster, when we finally see it is suitably creepy without being too scary. There is plenty of action from start to finish and some great special effects. The cast do a solid enough job in a way that makes it clear that we aren't meant to be taking it too seriously. Brendon Fraser is fairly impressive as Rick and Rachel Weisz is good as Evelyn. They are ably supported by the likes of John Hannah, Jonathan; Arnold Vosloo, Imhotep and Omid Djalili as the gaoler who accompanies then. Overall I'd recommend this; it was a lot more fun than I expected.",The Mummy
11,ma-cortes,"Attractive and diverting adventure movie with thrills , visual overkill and bombastic special effects",6,30 March 2021,"Amusing and funny film with no much terror , but with plenty of entertainment , intrigue , suspense and a lot of fun .

Things go wrong when the cursed mummified priest Himhotep : Arnold Vosloo was reborn and wants to use Evelyn to resurrect his loved sweetheart : Patricia Velasquez.It is a silly and cheesy fun that nothing to do with the 1932 classy The Mummy by Karl Freund, starred by Boris Karloff , being a very free , loose rendition to the vintage film . In fact , this is a simple and plain entertainment with no much sense in Saturday matinee tradition . A loudy and crowded version marred by its abundant Computer Generator FX and excessive digital visuals . It displays a great number of weird events and creepy appearances as spooky skeletons , eerie tombs , terrifying Zombies , astonishing mummies , flesh-eating beetles and anything else .Special mention for the thrilling and rousing musical score by the great Jerry Goldsmith .

12,Quinoa1984,a look back 18 years later on Stephen Sommers' big stab at Hollywood escapism,6,7 June 2017,"This movie is like if you take Raiders of the Lost Ark (and other Indiana Jones movies in general, those serial-tropes) and deduct like 10,000 IQ points from it. It's *so* Raiders, but it's also still, in being true to the original 1932 film, still SO Dracula- rip-off in some ways, even down to Kevin J O'Connor (OH MY GOD NOT- HENRY_PLAINVIEW from TWWB!) playing Renfield to Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep (though Renfield crossed with Alfred Molina from Raiders- did I mention this is RAIDERS with like a lot of dumbness injected in?) It's a slam-bang action movie where half of the dialog are full-on *Movie* lines. You know the ones? This is where characters, especially Brendan Fraser (who, honestly, is having the time of his life in this role), spout off a lot of clichés - Rick makes sure to say ""We're in deep trouble"" more than once, or to be ready with a line while being tossed conveniently across the room of the inside of a pyramid. And characters just do dumb thing after dumb thing, or characters appear where they shouldn't but hey gotta advance the plot... like the whole entire group of dumb American cowboys(!?) who manage to make it off of the boat that catches on fire and while we get scenic views of Fraser and Weisz and her brother going across the desert, the rest are not to be seen... until convenient.Oh, Rachel Weisz, by the way, is a great thing about this movie. Really, she's the one who practically got a career off of this movie, and she is so incredibly charming and dorky (the scene where she gets drunk is a different kind of drunk scene than we get in Raiders with Marion, I should note). She may be a ""Damsel"" occasionally in distress, but she is acting Evelyn on a wavelength that gives the movie an energy and delight that helps to balance out all of the stock actors and characters surrounding her (even O'Connor, who is giving this one- note weasel his all, is that). She and Fraser have the kind of old-time Hollywood chemistry, with enough modernity, that makes the movie watchable even as it gets so.... so.... so.... so... so dumb.And yet... it's entertaining. It's occasionally cheesy and haphazard - my God, does that climax where every single thing seems to come alive, usually by mistake - and I neglect to note how, despite being from old Egyptian lore (even if that's lore taken from older movies and serials), it also borrows in one giant chunk from the Evil Dead. But... well, I kept watching and not simply because I had to for an upcoming podcast.PS: Spoiler -about O'Connor's Beni... near the end, they really didn't know what to do with him, did they? I mean the writers; he's about ready to escape on the camel, he has a good amount of gold after getting away with being a conniving creep... but he sticks around and goes back inside, and as soon as he does we know exactly what's coming for him. The movie also goes the extra step of showing us how he meets his maker. It feels oddly cruel though, despite how slimy he's been. I almost felt sorry for him or even something close to sympathy. Isn't it enough to assume he's squashed with everything else inside the pyramid once it collapses? Like anything else here, it's overkill.",The Mummy
13,ComedyFan2010,"Great special effects, thats it",5,18 April 2010,"What I loved about this movie were the visual effects. Great scenery, costumes and special effects. I have no idea if they are historically accurate, but when it comes to a movie that was made for entertainment, I don't really care about historical accuracy.My main problem with the movie were the main characters. I certainly do not blame it on the actors, they can only work with what they have. I think that if after watching the story of the mummy in the beginning and getting to know the characters I am rooting for the mummy hoping that he gets all he wants and kills everyone, than there is a problem.While I think that Brandan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are great for the movie like this, but I feel no chemistry. Also they created too many idiot character. That brother, played by John Hannah was completely useless. He was there for comic relief and yet was not funny at all.That was another problem I had with the movie. They tried too much to be funny. I knew already that this won't be a horror movie, but I was hoping for adventure. I have nothing against comic relief in adventure movies (as long as it is funny), but in the one they just tried too much to be funny. And they were failing, stupid one liners didn't do it for me. I will still watch Mummy 2, because I heard that it is better than the first one and I hope that this time it will have more adventure in it.",The Mummy
14,Coventry,Well...at least the computer effect-guys had fun.,3,4 September 2003,"Small spoilers coming up....This is the second review I write about the same topic. The cursed priest Imhotep and his forbidden love for Anck-Su-Namun. A wonderful story and one of the most magnificent tales ever told in my opinion. But, to my regret, this review will be a lot less favourable than the ones I did for the 1932 version.First of all, actor Arnold Vosloo had the unrewarding task to follow into the footsteps of the greatest actor who ever lived....Boris Karloff played the mummy in the original version and to his style and appearance can never be lived up to. In another great Ancient Egypt-story, Christopher Lee portrayed a mummy as well ( he was called Kharis, if I'm not mistaken) so being a worthy follow-up to those 2 screen legends, Arnold Vosloo fails enormously. In fact, he's not a very well known actor at all, I only recognized him from the inferior Darman sequels. That was negative element number one, but so far...I hadn't lost all hope yet. No, that happened when the CGI came along... Such a shame...this version is obviously made for a complete other kind of audience. Young people mostly, I think...the computer generation. I'm not that old or something but I prefer the old-fashioned make-up effects a lot more. There's no love in this version at all and no matter what they may say : Not one computer generated effect has the ability to scare people. The mummy ( especially in his most early phase of decomposition ) is laughable and some of the most unrealistic things I ever saw....Furthermore: the sandstorms, the bugs, the servants of Imhotep etc, they're all a waste of money. One look in the eyes of good old Boris Karloff and you're frightened a 100 times more. The whole traditional story of Imhotep is explained in the first 5 minutes and the last 10...all what's in between is a useless story about treasure hunters looking for the lost city of Hamunaptra and ""Americans vs British""-jokes... There are a lot more ( smaller ) aspects about this movie that bugged me, too. For example, the huge amout of comedy in it. I love a good oneliner from time to time but this is just way over the top. I don't have much to say about the acting performances. Brendan Frasier is one of the few actors that I don't care about at all. I don't think he sucks nor do I think he's good. Neutral guy in my opinion. He did make a lot of bad films, but I don't think he was ever to blame for it. I did like Airheads in wich he starred, but in that one Steve Buscemi totally steals the show. I don't care much about Rachel Weisz neither...she looks cute from time to time, that's all. Now, this review could be taken as very positive too. If you like modern horror with an overload of CGI, instead of good plot twists...I highly recommend it. If you've got any sense of tradition or myth, avoid it. Stephen Sommers totally wasted a piece of true art here. And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse than this, he comes along with the Mummy Returns. I still hate myself for watching that...The Mummy was bad, the Mummy Returns was a complete disaster. My humble opinion...2/10",The Mummy

16,hitchcockthelegend,It's not horror you know - it's just real good family fun.,8,31 May 2011,"The Mummy is directed by Stephen Sommers, who also co-writes the screenplay with John L. Balderston. It stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo & Kevin J. O'Connor. Jerry Goldsmith scores the music and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle. Plot sees Fraser as ex-Foreign Legionnaire adventurer Rick O'Connell, who teams up with Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz) and her cowardly brother Jonathan (Hannah), to try and stave off the apocalypse born out of the unleashing of the mummified remains of High Priest Imhotep (Vosloo).It's true to say that ""Indiana Jones"" raised the bar for action/adventure films in the modern era, the kind involving treasure, artifacts and mystical perils. It's arguably true enough to say that with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" the standard has been set so high it's unlikely to be bettered. There's been a number of similar films to have come along post ""Indiana Jones"", films that have one thing in common, that the critics are scornful towards them whilst the box office has kerchinged with the sound of cash being spent by the cinema going public. ""The Mummy"" is one such movie. Universal rework their own 1930's creeper to deliver a high energy, effects laden adventure full of wit, stunts and eye candy fun. Yes it's ""Indiana Jones"" lite, but so what? We may be lacking an intellectual script, but for sheer guts, construction of set-pieces and interesting story, this delivers wholesome family entertainment. Cast are fine, Fraser comfortably files in for square jawed heroics and Weisz is suitably posh, spunky and sexy. Hannah revels in playing a wastrel type, while Arnold Vosloo is enjoying himself greatly. However it's ultimately the effects that win out, explosive and eye poppingly enjoyable, Sommers and his team have not pulled any punches in their willingness to entertain all the adventure film loving family. 7.5/10",The Mummy
17,Theo Robertson,"Silly , Dumb And Only Slightly Entertaining",6,28 January 2003,"I remember seeing the trailers for his film several weeks before it was released at the cinema in 1999 and was under the impression it was going to be a breath taking horror film , but when it hit the cinemas and the critics described it as an Indiana Jones type adventure I felt robbed of somethingOn its own merits THE MUMMY is entertaining enough , there's lot of action , a few rare scary bits but far too much humour which threatens to sink the film . I guess this is down to the producers trying to attract a younger audience and boost their profits but this all leads to a silly film . And I got the distinct impression that he script was written around the FX . For example there's a special effects packed meteor shower but there's no explanation for it , it adds nothing to plot and is never referred to again even though it kills a lot of people . Obviously the scene was written to show off some CGI THE MUMMY does sometimes have its better parts , mainly when it tries to get back to being a horror film but I often found myself wishing I was watching an often rumoured Clive Barker version of THE MUMMYAs a footnote I couldn't help noticing that THE MUMMY starts with a flash back to several thousand years ago and is followed by a big battle with combatants falling from a great height .

Once there they find the ominous sounding book of the dead & after Evelyn foolishly reads some of the ancient incantations the mummifies remains of an evil high priest named Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) come to life. Imhotep then sets about resurrecting his ancient love Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez) & spreading his evil throughout the world...Written & directed by Stephen Sommers this is a big budget remake of the black and white version of The Mummy (1932) & I actually much prefer this film over the original. The script is very different to the original & in reality only the central Imhotep character & the title remain, while the original was pretty slow going horror this is a big fast & furious overblown action adventure that's as comparable to an Indiana Jones film as it is to any horror film. There's plenty of action, fights, shoot-outs, CGI special effects & huge set pieces. It's a very enjoyable ride & the film provides good entertainment, I though it was perhaps a little slow at times as it's almost an hour before Imhotep is resurrected & that side of the film kicks in. The film never takes itself seriously which is fine I suppose but I thought there was maybe a bit too much family orientated comedy relief. If your looking for big budget action & CGI effects then you could do a lot worse than The Mummy.Director Sommers does a decent enough job, there's plenty of flashy special effects & camera trickery. The action scenes are well shot as are the horror elements although it was clearly aimed at a fairly young audience.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 The Mummy is as well made as you would expect & has that Hollywood polish to it. According to the IMDb the Nile scenes were shot in Surrey in England! Not that you'd ever know it unless you were told... The acting was OK although I thought Kevin J. O'Conor as Benni became very annoying.The Mummy is a good big budget action adventure that will entertain most. A bit shallow & maybe there's not a whole lot to it but it's good fun, definitely worth a watch & I can't really see anyone not enjoying it to some extent. Followed by the even better The Mummy Returns (2001).",The Mummy
19,CinemaSerf,"Good harmless, if brainless, fun....",7,7 December 2019,"This is just a good bit of fun. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz star as the unlikely couple who set off to discover the golden treasures of Pharaoh Seti I. Alongside her hapless, scaredy-cat brother (John Hannah) they encounter the Mummy - an epitome of evil, disease and destruction - and engage in a battle royale to defeat this monstrous reincarnation. Stephen Sommers keeps this moving along well, and there is enough in the script to make you smile now and again. Perhaps not a film to be too closely scrutinised by any Egyptologists out there, but it's an enjoyable little romp through a rarely exploited vein of ancient mythology.",The Mummy
20,zardoz-13,Rebel With A Gauze!,9,18 July 2008,"Starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, this atmospheric, $80 million special effects extravaganza emerges as a first-rate, old-fashioned, rip-snorting cliffhanger. Director Stephen Sommers' tongue-in-cheek tale of supernatural terror has about as many sheets in the wind as previous ""Mummy"" yarns. Although earlier ""Mummies"" qualified as little more than the love-sick fantasies of a vindictive Egyptian zombie, this lively incarnation blends elements of Sam Raimi's campy ""Evil Dead"" series with Steven Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to yield a high-octane action adventure spectacle. After sitting through this giddy but ghoulish saga, you won't go home and worry about the phantoms under your bed.Writer & director Stephen Sommers' creepy but comic version tops even the straightforward, black & white Boris Karloff original! Of course, the 1932 ""Mummy"" remains an undisputed classic, with the Technicolor 1959 Christopher Lee & Peter Cushing opus not far behind. Nevertheless, the new ""Mummy"" serves as the gauge by which all future ""Mummies"" will be measured. This light-hearted but corpse littered chiller captures the period flavor of all of those imperialist British Empire thrillers while it reinvents its infamous rebel with a gauze. Audiences that typically shun fright fests may find its witty, self-depreciating approach here as refreshing as its dazzling state-of-the-art digital foes are dangerous.Sommers sets the stage with an expository seven minute ""Prince of Egypt"" like prologue. The ancient city of Thebes appears in all its fabulous splendor in the year 1290 B.C. Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo of ""Hard Target""), Pharaoh's trusted high priest, and the ruler's sexy concubine, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez of ""Mindhunters""), are fooling around when Pharaoh Seti I (Aharon Ipale of ""Son of the Pink Panther"") catches them red-handed. Pharaoh covers his scantily clad mistress with tattoos that smear at the least touch so he knows something stinks. Treacherously, Imhotep and Anck Su brandish weapons and assassinate Pharaoh. The gory gutley occurs either off-screen or is shown in warped shadows stretching across the high walls of the temple.Pharaoh's elite bodyguards arrive too late to save their sire. Instead, they watch in horror as Anck Su disembowels herself after proclaiming her freedom from Pharaoh's slavery. Anck Su's logicsuicidal as it seemsis that only Imhotep can bring her back to life with is powerful sorcery, so she distracts the bodyguards while he makes good his escape. Later, Imhotep has all but reincarnated Anck Su when the gung-ho bodyguards turn up in Hamunaptra, the city of the Dead, and skewer his skullduggery. Imhotep suffers a fate worse than death. His captors remove his tongue so he cannot scream, wrap him from head to toe in burial linen and lock him up alive in an escape-proof crypt with scores of vicious, cannibalistic scarabs designed to chomp on him for an eternity. According to the prophecy, Imhotep must never arise, least he unleash the ten plagues upon Egypt! The story flashes forward to the year 1923 amid the ruins of Hamunaptra as an outnumbered French Foreign Legion battalion fights an army of tribal horsemen armed with rifles. Meanwhile, from a nearby cliff, the descendents of Pharaoh's bodyguard watch as the desert warriors annihilate the hapless French. Swathed in black robes like Ninjas, with tattoos on their cheeks, they have sworn themselves to guard the crypt of the mummy. Only Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser of ""Gods & Monsters""), a Yankee adventurer in the Legion and a pathetic soldier Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Conner of ""Van Helsing"") survive the massacre. Beni hides in a crypt, while Rick flees into the desert. The bodyguards decide not to kill Rick because they believe that the Sahara will finish him off. Miraculously, O'Connell survives and makes his way to Cairo where he winds up in prison with a hangman's noose in his future.Forward the story leaps another couple of years. Sommers introduces us to Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz of ""Eragon""), an attractive but disaster-prone librarian in the Cairo-based Museum of Antiquities. In one of the funniest scenes, Evelyn knocks down a bookcase when she tries to shelve a misplaced tome. This incident triggers a domino effect that topples the rest of the bookcases in a perfect circle around the room. This marvelously staged gag rivals some of Buster Keaton's legendary stunts in his silent movies. Naturally, the curator (Erick Avari of ""Stargate"") reprimands Eve, but he cannot fire her because of her late parents' philanthropy for the library. Anyway, Evelyn is a first-class Egyptologist who wants to prove that she is more than just a pretty face. Later, while Evelyn is cleaning up her mess, she stumbles onto her drunken rouge of a brother, Jonathan (John Hannah of ""Sliding Doors'), in a display gallery. He shows her a neat Rubic's cube type box with a treasure map to Hamunaptra. Jonathan reveals that he stole it from Rick O'Connell who is scheduled to hang on the gallows at Cairo Prison. Evelyn strikes a bargain with the greedy warden (Omid Djalili of ""Mean Machine"") and wins Rick's freedom.""Deep Rising"" director Stephen Sommers has turned up the heat on what would rate as little more than a pulpy but palatable potboiler. Most ""Mummy"" movies are pedestrian, but Sommers' ""Mummy"" benefits from the kind of writing that you find in the adventures of Edgar Rice Burroughs, H. Rider Haggard, and Rudyard Kipling. ""The Mummy"" whirls along at a breakneck pace, bristling with thrills, chills, and frills. The hero is appropriately stalwart, the damsel is naturally gorgeous, and the villain eminently formidable. They embark on a long journey wallpapered with danger and excitement. Let's not forget about those grisly bugs that can crawl under your skin and strip the flesh off you like piranha. The performances are uniformly fun. Arnold Vosloo takes top honors as the moody Imhotep. Although he doesn't deliver much dialogue, Vosloo has enormous screen presence. Happily, he never tries to look anything like Boris Karloff.If you plunge into ""The Mummy"" looking for nightmares, prepared to be disappointed.",The Mummy
21,Boba_Fett1138,Good simple entertainment.,7,6 May 2007,"At the time of its release, both the public and critics were screaming and shouting that this movie for being to much of an Indiana Jones wannabe. Now that this storm has settled down, I hope that more people will be able to take this movie for what it is; pure simple entertainment.This is certainly a movie that entertains. It's clean and simple and makes no attempt in putting in any realism or much originality for that matter.It's obvious that Stephen Sommers, just like with his other movie ""Van Helsing"", was attempting to revive the old adventure genre from the '30's/'40's. And just as with ""Van Helsing"" was the case, it doesn't do this very successfully. Modern movie-making and '30's/'40's adventurous storytelling just don't go together well anymore. The movie is perhaps more of a spoof than an homage at times. And although I certainly enjoy and admire Stephen Sommers attempts, I just don't think these sort of movies will ever make a large impact, or revive the genre from the old days. But I certainly wouldn't mind seeing more simple big blockbuster movies from Stephen Sommers in the future.The movie is loosely and I mean very loosely based on the 1932 ""The Mummy"", starring Boris Karloff in the title role. The movie mostly chooses its own approach and simply uses the concept of the mummy for an overblown entertaining movie with a simple story.But entertaining this movie surely is. The movie is filled with fun characters, lots of over-the-top action and a perfectly adventurous feeling all over it, due to the movie its settings and traveling elements.The characters are perhaps the foremost reason why the movie works out so entertaining. All of the characters are extremely simple and stereotypical but that works really well for such a movie like this one, that obviously doesn't take itself too serious. On top of that the movie is also really well cast. It was the movie that introduced the world to Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, though his career never really got off the ground. Brendan Fraser shows how well he can handle the comical sequences but he also is convincing as the action hero of the movie, mainly because he has the right looks for it. Rachel Weisz plays a more light and naive kind of role and it actually is hard to believe that she is mostly playing now more demanding roles in movies such as ""Constant Gardener"" and ""The Fountain"". John Hannah is perfect as the more comical sidekick of the movie and also Arnold Vosloo impresses as the villainous mummy. Also the supporting roles of the movie are very entertaining, such as the stereotypical cowboy-type Americans and Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni, who also provides some comical notes. The characters are also made more entertaining by some fine and fun written dialog.But there isn't much else to the script really. The movie purely is an excuses to show off some new special effects and let the mummy cause all kind of mayhem across Egypt. Yes, its incredibly simple but perhaps also all the more entertaining because of that.The sequences with the movie definitely are the highlights of the movie, as he unleashes all the biblical plagues across Egypt. The special effects are convincingly looking for the mummy and his neat tricks, though it's definitely true that by todays standards the effects are all quite slightly below average.The settings of the movie are nice, though some are obviously fake, and they help to give the movie its adventurous feeling. The movie obviously had an high budget and it shows in its action sequences and special effects. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is also fine and truly uplifts the movie. Jerry Goldsmith has made a couple of epic scores for some not so epic movies.Good simple quality entertainment. Just sit back and enjoy!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Mummy
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""Wait, what? That makes no sen... ooooh... preeetty...""",6,29 December 2009,"Before I begin this, you should know that I don't care for Indiana Jones either. I caught(not by choice) one of the old ones, and I could not tell you which of them it was. Uh... it had spiders... oh, and a scene in a plane that I believe inspired the lyrics of at least the chorus of a song by Aqua, the short-lived Danish pop phenomenon. So, on to this pile... at this point, the flicks Sommers was... putting, let's go with that... out were still intolerable(of what I've seen by him, only G.I. Joe did not physically hurt me to sit through). He needs to stay far away(I'd be willing to sign a petition to enforce that, can we get a court to issue a powerful restraining order, maybe?) from classic horror films, because, as should be no secret to anyone who's seen him do a pathetic attempt at it, *he lacks even the most basic level of understanding of the genre*. Is *anyone* scared by anything in any of these? He can't build suspense or tension, and he refuses to commit to any creature enough to make it menacing. I haven't watched the original, from 1932 and starring Boris Karloff, but I am certain it is superior to this. Frankly, this is idiotic. It is not funny, it is not entertaining, and it is not engaging. Every single character is obnoxious(a couple are offensive Middle Eastern stereotypes, as well), and what few personality traits they do have are all wildly unappealing. Are we supposed to care about these people? I can imagine their own families not wanting anything to do with them. The effects(and yes, they are fairly well-done(meanwhile, this was made when The Matrix was, so it could have been better) though there are too many of them, and it ceases to be dramatic) are *clearly* the focus here, evidenced partially by the fact that these morons literally *stand in place to gawk at them when in imminent danger*, destroying a lot of the sense of potential peril. Why are the monsters all so utterly inept? Yes, yes... it's a cinematic convention that they have to suck when attacking the leads, however, these seem *completely* useless. In general, this is extremely over the top. The score is another example of that. Evelyn falls for Rick, for no other reasons than that he's there, he's Caucasian and he's not related to her by blood. The action is not all that exciting. That's not a mummy, anyway; it's a decomposing body that has risen from the dead... anybody who knows their supernatural lore will tell you immediately that that's a *zombie*. Seriously, if they thought the old bandage look was silly, then why did they make a movie of the monster at all? This is not entirely devoid of interesting bits. And Oded Fehr, arguably the strongest charismatic screen presence, was certainly cool to see again. He was the best part of this for me. There is mild and occasionally disturbing violence, and brief partial nudity in this. The DVD contains two commentary tracks(one with the director and editor, and one with Fraser) that aren't half bad, a handful of short things that show you the different elements of the visual effects, three storyboard to final film comparisons, a few deleted scenes, a photo montage and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of Stephen and/or adventure. 6/10",The Mummy
23,neil-476,First rate romp,9,19 December 2010,"To remake The Mummy in the style of Indiana Jones but with a humorous edge was a stroke of genius, and it is executed very well in this movie.Brendan Fraser nominally heads a cast who all perform very well, but Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep hits the number one spot as far as I'm concerned (although I have a distinct soft spot, if that's the right expression, for Patricia Velasquez' gold painted costume as Anck Su Namun.The action practically never lets up, especially in the last 40 minutes or so, and his helped along by equal quantities of wisecracks and special effects.

Actually, this is much better than the original. It doesn't attempt to be remotely scary, opting instead for a goofy, wise-cracking tone reminiscent of the Indiana Jones movies. Of course, it's nowhere near as good as those -- it's not as light on its feet and it's burdened by a hefty load of not very impressive digital effects.

25,Uriah43,More Action than Previous Mummy Films,7,5 September 2018,"While serving in the French Foreign Legion, an American by the name of ""Rick O'Connell"" (Brendan Fraser) manages to survive a ferocious battle at the site of the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra which had been lost under the sands of the desert for thousands of years. While there he discovers a box which contains a key of some sort. But rather than stay there and investigate any further he becomes extremely uneasy about the place and leaves the city as soon as possible. A few years later the key is stolen from him but as luck would have it the new owner, ""Evelyn Carnahan"" (Rachel Weisz) comes to him while he is in prison and asks him to lead her and a small party to this lost city. Since he is about to be hanged he readily agrees if she can convince the warden, ""Gad Hassan"" (Omid Djalili) to free him. Although she manages to do just that they soon find that they aren't the only ones looking to find Hamunaptra. Neither do they realize the evil presence that awaits them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining film which was nominated for several awards, most notably in the categories of best sound and visual effects. Additionally, it was also nominated for a Saturn Award for ""Best Fantasy Film"". To that point, I should mention that--unlike most ""Mummy films"" produced previously--this particular movie contains quite a bit more action than the others which diminishes the overall horror aspect to a great degree. Even so, I found this to be an enjoyable movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",The Mummy

O'Connor: Triumphant special effects that translates as an action adventure film as oppose to horror aspects in the 1932 original. It is an enchanting visual sight of everything ancient but the story isn't so wondrous. It opens in ancient Egypt where a kingdom is brought down with the death of Ferrell and the prisoners enclosed in caskets and wrapped as mummies. Jump ahead to the 1920's where the search for an ancient book is in progress. Brendan Fraser is introduced as a prisoner in Egypt until Rachel Weisz orders his release. She and her brother need his assistance in tracking the book. It is obvious that the mummy will be freed in the process with chaos to follow. Director Stephen Sommers handles the action effectively. Fraser is given the one role of any interest. He brings humour throughout as he springs from one action sequence to the next. Weisz is basically a potential romantic interest for Fraser. John Hannah plays her brother and the role is as cardboard as her's. The wrappings on the mummy's body contain more personality than both characters combined. The special effects are the film's best selling point as objects shift forms and creatures descend into reality. Fine concept within a screenplay that remains lost within the mindless chaos.

27,FlashCallahan,Loosen the knot and let me go.......,6,6 June 2015,"In ancient Egypt, high priest Imhotep started a relationship with Anck Su Namun, Pharaoh Seti's Mistress. When Seti finds, Imhotep and Namun kill him, but can't escape the guards. Anck Su Namun commits suicide, while Imhotep is mummified alive in Hamunaptra, the city of the Dead. More than thirty-six centuries later, adventurer Rick leads Egyptologist Evelyn and her brother Jonathan to Hamunaptra. While Jonathan is keen on finding the legendary Egyptian treasures, Evelyn wants to search for the Book of the Living, which would clarify historical knowledge about ancient Egyptian. Unfortunately, they and a rival group of Americans free Imhotep's mummy from his eternal prison. With the ancient priest on the loose, they face not only a dangerous enemy, but also a massive threat to today's world. Imhotep wants to bring Anck Su Namun back to life by using Evelyn's body, but he also wants to rid the world of disbelieving crowds of democracy supporters to be able to enforce his dictatorship......By fusing horror and action on a grand scale, Sommers had a massive franchise on his hands. 1999 was an effects heavy summer for movies also. We had Episode I, The Matrix, Wild Wild West, and this.Now, whilst the three other movies are remembered more for various reasons, this has since been a bit of a forgotten oddity, and seeing it nearly sixteen years later, its clear as to why.Not only did the film try to reboot the old Universal horrors of the early twentieth century, it also pseudo tried to be the new Indiana Jones, and this is the film gravest mistake. Fraser is great as O' Connell, but at times he just becomes too cocky for his own good and comes across as a bit of a moron. The comedy elements are there, Hannah is particularly hammy as the comedy sidekick, but a lot of the humour is very ethnically based, especially when Djalli is in the frame.The effects were pretty groundbreaking at the time, and the film was all about spectacle, rather than narrative, but alas, the effects have aged as badly as the titular creature, and you realise again that the actual movies narrative is based around the next special effect set piece Sommers has to give us.But it's still a lot of fun, the three leads have wonderful chemistry together, Vosloo is great as the villain, and despite it being fifteen minutes too long, it's a fun ride.",The Mummy

I can't help but feel that the movie would have been bettered if Stephen Sommers had nothing to do with it, yet compare to his work with ""Van Helsing"" and ""the Scorpian King"" will attest to, this IS the better movie.

It is a great fast paced action movie with the only real horror being the fact the good guys are up against a mummy.  This one had the better plot of the two mummy movies, but the sequel had the better action so I like them about the same.  This one has them discovering the lost city and awakening the mummy from his sleep.  He starts out all rotted, but as he kills the group that awoke him he regains his former body. Brendan Fraser is rather good in this one as the hero.  The rest of the cast does rather good too, though no real big name stars were used in the other roles.  Some pretty good special effects too, though they are definitely not the best ever witnessed on the big screen.  This movie is just an old-fashioned action movie though so it works.

Also, be ready for quite a few laugh-out-loud parts.Everything magically works, granting the viewer a highly entertaining romp. Brendan Fraser is perfect as the Indiana Jones wannabe. Rachael Weisz is so cute it's hard to take your eyes off her (WATCH OUT for her opening library scene).

31,JamesHitchcock,Entertaining viewing for anyone looking for pure entertainment,6,10 December 2007,"In Ancient Egypt the Pharaoh Seti I is murdered by his mistress, Anck-su-Namun, and her lover, Imhotep. For his part in the crime Imhotep is sentenced to be ""mummified alive"". (It is not explained exactly how this is carried out, but as the vital organs were always removed as a necessary initial step in the mummification process, keeping the subject alive throughout must have been quite tricky).Fast-forward to the 1920s. Rick O'Connell, an American serving with the French Foreign Legion, and Evelyn Carnahan, a half-British half-Egyptian librarian and expert Egyptologist, are on a quest to find the lost city of Hamunaptra. (Rick appears to be serving with the Legion in Egypt itself, even though in the 1920s the country was under British rule. The nearest French troops would have been in Syria). Unfortunately, they inadvertently disturb the corpse of Imhotep, which proves to be a mistake. Apparently, reanimating someone who has been mummified alive can have all sorts of dire consequences for the world, such as unleashing the Ten Plagues of Egypt. Rick and Evelyn, together with her inept and cowardly brother Jonathan, have to try and undo the harm they have unwittingly caused. In this task they have the assistance of the Medji, a tribe of desert nomads descended from the bodyguards of the murdered Pharaoh, who have for three millennia acted as the guardians of the lost city.As one might guess from the above synopsis, this is not a serious or realistic film. It is an adventure story with supernatural elements in the tradition of Rider Haggard's ""She"", and obviously influenced by Spielberg's Indiana Jones films, themselves influenced by the old Saturday morning serials. It was to be followed two years later by a sequel, ""The Mummy Returns"", which charts the adventures of Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan ten years later. (By 1935 Rick and Evelyn are married and have a young son, Alex).The earlier film's main claim to fame is that it made a big international star of the lovely Rachel Weisz. Prior to 1999, apart from the moderately good but unremarkable American thriller ""Chain Reaction"", she was best-known as the star of British art-house movies. ""The Mummy"" established her as a Hollywood name. Perhaps this change in her status influenced the way she appears in the two films. In ""The Mummy"" Evelyn is portrayed as intelligent but rather dowdy, hiding her good looks behind thick spectacles, and clumsy. (In one memorable scene she manages to demolish an entire library). Given that ten years are supposed to pass between ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", she should by the time of the later film have matured into a respectable matron in her late thirties. Instead, she is played as a sexy vamp, especially in her duel with Patricia Velazquez, and actually looks younger rather than ten years older. British art-house actresses might look dowdy, but not Hollywood superstars.""The Mummy"" is perhaps overlong and the pace sometimes flags, especially during the first half. (""The Mummy Returns"", which has an even more incredible and convoluted plot, manages to keep the interest rather better). There is, of course, nothing of any deep significance about it, but it does make for entertaining viewing for anyone in the mood for pure entertainment. 6/10",The Mummy
32,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""We are in some serious trouble""",8,24 November 2003,"In the 1990's, a stream of remakes came out after the universal horror films with the monsters: Dracula(Bram Stoker's Dracula), Frankenstein(Mary Shelley's Frankenstein), The Wolf Man(Wolf) and now The Mummy made after the same title. The original stared Boris Karloff and is truly a haunting movie. Despite the fact that slow moving mummies are not as scary of a villain, Boris brought in an incredible eerie performance that is so memorable that made mummies scary. How could we update the story to make mummies more terrifying to a newer audience? Make them faster? Make them smarter? How much they could control? How dangerous they truly are? They put a bunch of CGI into the film but somehow despite it being over the top at times, the story is what makes The Mummy into a great remake and respects the original making the mummy scary again.In 1926, Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist Evelyn is presented with an intricate box and map by her bumbling brother Jonathan, who says he found it. After the pair discover the map leads to Hamunaptra, Jonathan reveals he actually stole it from an American named Rick O'Connell, who is currently in prison. Rick tells them that he knows the location of the city because his unit reached the fabled city, only to be overrun by hostile Bedouins. He makes a deal with Evelyn to reveal the location of Hamunaptra, in exchange for Evelyn saving Rick from being hanged. Rick leads Evelyn and Jonathan's small expedition to the city, where they discover a mummy who Evelyn accidentally wakes up and he's after a band of American treasure hunters who have taken his treasures and wants Evelyn to bring back his true love that he died for.I really liked the actors they put in this film. I know Brendan Fraiser isn't the best actor, but he really made me believe in him as an adventure hero almost to the likes of Indiana Jones. He's funny, smart, strong, charming and handsome, everything you could want. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn was beautiful, stubborn and smart, she was exactly what all these boys needed and had great chemistry with Fraiser. The humor is a lot, they use a lot of jokes which at times could take away from the film. The CGI is also a lot, but it added to the story and wasn't to the point of unbelievable. I thought the idea of having a faster mummy was more terrifying and that he wouldn't stop coming after his victims in such a horrific way was a great idea. I really did like The Mummy, I know it certainly has it's flaws, but it's just a fun adventure horror movie that really hooks you from beginning to end. The sequels just didn't add up well to this movie, I would recommend The Mummy any day. The haters honestly just don't know how to have any fun, any flawed film could still be a good time and The Mummy certainly is one one them.8/10",The Mummy
33,MovieAddict2016,"Great fun in the vein of ""Indiana Jones""...",8,7 October 2003,"""The Mummy"" is an adventurous yarn in the vein of ""Indiana Jones."" It's a lot of fun, very charming, and never tries to be more than what it is. What is it? An entertaining summer flick which is not only worth seeing, but perhaps even owning. It's one of those fun movies you can return to over and over again and never grow tired of doing so.It's hardly a remake of the Universal classic of the same name. It's merely a new way to tell the story with the same basic idea - a murderous mummy is brought back from the dead. This time we have a hero and heroine who must stop him before he takes over the world, or something along the line of world domination.The hero is Rick (Brendan Fraser), a thief thriving off the very basics out in Egypt circa 1930. Arrested and to be hanged, he is saved by the heroine (Rachel Weisz), who believes he may hold the key to helping them find an ancient Egyptian kingdom buried under the sand, if I recall correctly (though it has been a while since I've seen this). Little does she know what lurks beneath the sand near that old kingdom is none other than the remains of a man who was caught cheating on the king's wife years ago and mummified.Now, after unearthing the remains of the kingdom, the expedition led by our heroes come upon an ancient ""Book of the Dead,"" which, when read from, brings the ancient mummy back to life. Now he is out to kill, regenerate and bring back his old lover - pretty neat, huh?I own ""Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy,"" a great movie spoofing the classic film. ""The Mummy"" isn't exactly a spoof but it's very tongue-in-cheek. It knows it isn't an Oscar-winner, it knows it stands nothing against the older film, and so it goes for pulp thrills. I actually believe that this film is a bit classy in execution - compared to many other entertainments floating around nowadays it stands as one of the only films to return to the roots of the pure adventure films like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) so successfully did.Brendan Fraser is a perfect choice for the lead star. Calm, but with ironic and sarcastic humor; cool, but a strong lead. I wondered what it would have been like if they had casted an actor in his role who would have taken it all more seriously. I bet the results would have been disastrous. Fraser knows that this is all good fun, and he's having a good time playing his role with comedy. Every once and a while you can catch a wink at the screen that lets us know that he knows what he's doing.2001 brought a sequel to ""The Mummy"" named, of all things, ""The Mummy Returns."" I found it just as fun as this film though some critics begged to differ. Summer 2002 brought yet another ""Mummy"" film, this one a prequel called ""The Scorpion King"" - it was a following of a co-star of the first sequel. The Mummy was not in it at all. It was a horrible film that wasn't near as fun as this one. So I recommend you see ""The Mummy"" as soon as humanly possible. After that, see ""The Mummy Returns.""Either way, you simply can't go wrong.",The Mummy

36,sddavis63,An Interesting If Flawed Remake That's Marginally Better Than The Original,6,27 November 2012,"It's taken me 13 years to watch this movie because, basically, I didn't like the original version! Of all the ""classic"" Universal horror movies, I thought 1932's ""The Mummy"" was the weakest. Aside from a great performance by Boris Karloff, it just wasn't that good. Universal knew how to make good horror movies, but what they so often did so right, they so totally failed at with ""The Mummy."" It wasn't exciting, it wasn't fun and it wasn't frightening. A horror movie, to be a horror movie, has to have at least one of those three things going for it. And, since remakes generally aren't as good as the original, I avoided this one like the plague until now. I'm pleasantly surprised, in that I actually thought this was marginally better than the 1932 version.What went wrong in 1932 did not go wrong in 1999. This movie was exciting - it was packed with action and had some great effects. This movie was fun - it had a tongue in cheek quality to it, and the performances (especially from leads Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) captured that tongue in cheek quality perfectly. And, at times at least, it was frightening. At least Imhotep was a ghastly, frightening being - not at all like the Imhotep of the original, who could have walked down the streets of Cairo with no one knowing who he was or thinking there was anything strange about him! So a lot of the problems were fixed, and made this pleasant watching.It was not, however, without problems. Essentially, it went a bit overboard. In particular, the last half hour - featuring all of Imhotep's mummified and dessicated but re-animated priests was a little bit ridiculous, and I have to confess that the point at which they appeared was the point at which my attention started to wander. The opening, which featured a helpful journey back to ancient Egypt and explained how Imhotep got into this position, was also perhaps a wee bit too long, but it didn't cause me to wander. Those mummified priests in the last half hour didn't work for me.When the last half hour of a movie causes you to lose a bit of interest - that's a problem. Overall, I enjoyed this, and I did think it marginally better than the original. For the 1932 version, I awarded a 5. Since this is - in my opinion - marginally better - 6/10.",The Mummy
37,thesar-2,Raiders of the Mummy's Tomb,7,13 May 2013,"It's not easy to separate the adventures of the blandly named ""Rick"" and the true movie adventurer Indiana Jones, but since Indy hadn't an excellent adventure since 1989 (and probably never will again,) this will do.The Mummy was actually a really fun ride. And that's all it is. Don't look for depth, for any amount of seriousness or even memorable characters – aside from the mostly absent title character, that is. Despite my first paragraph, it's best to avoid thinking of the superior Dr. Jones serials and just have fun. And, sure, it's silly – sometimes overly inane and the movie was way too convoluted; SEE: the opening novel-sized narration shots to set-up the background story. Oh, and some of the special effects not only don't hold up today, but were questionable back in 1999.AGAIN it's just a thrill adventure that requires you to leave your brain at the door. For, it has all the elements of old westerns, romantic slapstick of decades past and the horror elements of the original Mummy films of the 1930s.Adventurer Rick stumbles upon the city of the dead and years following, is taken in by a librarian and her brother to retrieve old books and other artifacts. None of them truly believe the old Egyptian myths of the undead being able to be resurrected and, of course, that's what's about to happen.""The Mummy,"" or High Priest Imhotep, does come back (eeeeventually – it really does take the movie a long time to (re)introduce the title character) and besides completely restoring his body to flesh and inadvertently causing Biblical plagues, his main mission is to also bring back his lovely adulteress.Reluctantly, Rick and the Gang vow to stop him because of some ""legend"" that hell would be on Earth. Actually, I think that was just to cause more tension in the film because other than words, that didn't seem like it would happen.Nevertheless, park your brain, let loose, laugh a lot, avoid the normal criticism people like me would normally write about and you'll have a good time. Rick is absolutely no Indy and the movie is certainly no Raiders, but since there were only two (out of four) solid Indiana Jones flicks, this is a good companion piece.",The Mummy

39,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Possibly the most enjoyable 'Mummy' film to date.,7,1 December 2018,"Somehow, 'The Mummy (1999)' is pretty much the most enjoyable film to bear its name, one that takes the classic universal monster and makes him into the foe for an 'Indiana Jones'-style, 'archaeologist action-hero' adventure. It's precisely because it doesn't take it self so dreadfully seriously that it works so well, always being a fun time even when it's at its spookiest. Having said that, it also has a respect for the lore and knows that it's supposed to be a horror, too, which makes for some memorably grotesque yet still entertainingly light sequences. 7/10",The Mummy
40,bowmanblue,"Fun, fun, fun",8,8 January 2015,"Okay, before I begin the review proper, I must warn you that I'm probably going to be using the word 'fun' a lot to describe 'The Mummy.' Because that's all it is – fun. A lot of people liken it to the Indiana Jones movies and I can see where they're coming from. Then again, an equally high proportion of the audience detests how the two movies are likened to each other. No, I'm certainly not saying that The Mummy is anywhere near as good as the Jones trilogy (notice how I'm leaving out the Crystal Skull out of that statement!), but it is similar.The Mummy is one of those 'family fun' kind of movies – an adventure which should most likely be screened on a Saturday afternoon for everyone to cheer along to. Brendan Fraser takes the lead and is at his best when he's acting big and dumb, but, in doing so, he's also completely lovable and easy to root for. Rachel Weisz is his 'love interest' and, apart from being able to read/speak the ancient texts, doesn't do that much for the portrayal of women in cinema, as she spends much of her time in need of rescue (you'll have to watch the sequel if you want to see her kicking some a$$!). John Hannah is her on-screen brother and he's the main 'comic relief' of the film – a part which sometimes goes horribly wrong if it's handled incorrectly. However, fortunately, despite being the coward of the bunch, he's funny enough not to be annoying (and even fires a gun or two near the end if you watch closely).So, our blundering trio of heroes only go and wake up an ancient mummy when they're raiding a tomb in Egypt. And he's not happy. Not only does he want to 'borrow' the bodily parts of those who woke him up, but he also wants to take over the world – typical, huh? The creature itself is actually CGI for the most part. I guess they couldn't get an actor who was decomposing to play the part. However, when he's fully formed, he's played by Arnold Vosloo, who does the job to act menacing (even when he doesn't say a word of English).So, expect gun fights, undead creatures chasing our heroes, the odd car chase and pretty much everything else you'd come to find in a PG action/adventure movie. Yes, nothing here is that new, but when something's handled correctly that doesn't matter. It's still a fun a film that should please everyone. Basically, there are two ways of watching The Mummy – you can either nitpick the whole thing and pull it apart, or you can simply gloss over any of the plot holes and simply enjoy it from what it is – the filmic equivalent of Brendan Fraser himself – big, dumb, silly fun, fun, fun.",The Mummy
41,ThomasDrufke,Death is Only the Beginning,3,6 June 2017,"It's always difficult for brainless action movies to hold up over time. It's incredibly rare that such films can stand more than a decade or so without feeling too silly. The Mummy, which was made nearly 2 decades ago, definitely falls under this category. With a dumb script, exaggerated acting, dated CGI, and a dopey tone, 1999's version of The Mummy is a cable movie at best.It's amazing to see how far this series has come, from the intellectual 1932 film to the blockbuster action 2017 feature, it's clear that this is a property that people are interested in no matter the genre it forms. With that said, if a film titled 'The Mummy' never manages to offer a single scare or thrill, there's something seriously wrong with the direction. ""But that's not the direction they wanted to take with the movie"", some may say, well then make the film you intended at least a little bit entertaining. I had heard this film wasn't to be taken seriously, but to show no respect or knowledge for the source material at all feels disappointing to say the least.The acting is abysmal. Some of it can certainly be contributed to the dialogue they were given and perhaps the direction as well, but the line delivery here is just brutal. I know Brendan Fraser isn't particularly regarded as Oscar caliber, but Rachel Weisz definitely is. To see all them do such poor work is more than difficult to watch. But I think this can all come back to the tone established by director and writer, Stephen Sommers. The lighter, goofier tone is clearly purposeful, but it only works if you buy into the characters. I always bring up the Fast & Furious as examples for these types of films because they succeed in making over the top action movies without sacrificing the dynamics between their central characters. The Mummy doesn't do that one bit.I think one of the things that does work is Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score. Not only does it harken back to the days of John Williams' heroic theme for Indiana Jones, but it actually complements the action quite well. It's just too bad I didn't particularly care for the action that was going on anyway. Overall, this film displays a serious lack of awareness in tone, humor, and writing, even if some of the action provides brief swashbuckling fun amidst a great score. The Mummy is forgettable.+Score-Tone-Rough acting & writing3.8/10",The Mummy
42,Cineanalyst,Raiders of the Lost Mummy,6,12 October 2018,"Since its beginnings, Universal's Mummy franchise, like the resurrected corpse in this one, has often found vitality in sucking the life force from other films. The 1932 ""Mummy"" starring Boris Karloff did so by reusing the plot and many of the details from the 1931 ""Dracula."" The 1940s Kharis series adopted the aesthetics of serials and B-picture adventures. Distributed by Universal, Hammer studios reworked these prior Mummy movies in its pastiche of 1959. The latest version of 2017 tried to imitate comic-book superhero movies. And, this ""Mummy"" of 1999 went full circle by borrowing, as plenty of others have pointed out, from the Indian Jones franchise, which in turn the Kharis series in particular has been credited as an influence on, along with other classic adventure films. Parts of the prior Universal mummy movies are also reworked here, though, and the 1999 version put a new twist on things with CGI--well before the 2017 Dark Universe debacle did likewise.Besides adopting and reworking the most popular aspects of Ancient Egyptian history and myth--the Book of the Dead, a hidden Valley of the Kings, the curse of King Tut's tomb and Old Testament stories of Jewish slaves and plagues--the basic story here is taken from the earlier ""Mummies,"" with treasure hunters searching for a lost Ancient Egyptian tomb, unleashing a curse, and the Mummy seeking a living female vessel to restore life to his ancient forbidden love, a princess. This Mummy has the same name as Karloff's, taken from the historical pyramid architect, Imhotep, and both characters don't like to be touched, which they explain is ""a silly Eastern superstition."" There's an Egyptologist curator who secretly guards against the discovery of the tomb like in ""The Mummy's Hand"" (1940), including by partially destroying evidence of its location--pottery in the original and a map here. The cutting off the tongue business, I think, is from the 1959 Hammer version. And there's an ancient flashback scene, which is placed at the beginning here, which isn't as interesting as the self-reflexive pool visions in the 1932 film, which two Kharis pictures later cannibalized.The 1932 ""Mummy,"" which is otherwise the best of the bunch, suffers from creaky sound, deathly-slow pacing and stiff acting. This ""Mummy"" solves that problem by adopting the mix of action and comic relief from the Indiana Jones movies. Beyond that, it also replaces ""Bugs, I hate bugs"" for Indiana's fear of snakes; the assortment of booby traps and secret passages; and the Biblical-level revenge upon those who trespass. At the least, taking the Indian Jones formula and infusing its classic monster story with CGI alleviates any problems with dullness, movement and pacing. As a horror film, however, the repetitive gaping mouth thing is more yawn-inducing than frightening. It could've done without the silly cat business, too.Despite its flaws, one can only wish that Universal's recent attempts at launching the Dark Universe, with its superhero action-movie antics in ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) and the 2017 ""Mummy,"" had someone as competent as Stephen Sommers at the helm. Besides integrating Universal's mummy property into an Indian Jones framework, he created the monster-rally ""Van Helsing"" (2004), which blended elements of James Bond, ""Moulin Rouge!"" (2001) and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine with Universal's traditional Dracula, Frankenstein and werewolf monsters.",The Mummy

45,CuriosityKilledShawn,Bimbo,7,11 September 2004,"Fun, but dumb. That's how I'd pretty much describe The Mummy. Stephen Sommers has done some wild b-movies in his time (Deep Rising) and was a great choice to write and direct this remake of the old 1930s Universal horror show. Though I must stress that very little of this film is original.Basically it's an Indiana Jones rip-off with bits of Evil Dead and Hellraiser thrown in. Clichés are abundant and stereotyped, stock characters make up much of the supporting cast. Not only do we get a fair English maiden and a bumbling Brit designed to make the yank look cool but there are also gung-ho cowboys, stuffy professors, a cowardly weasel traitor (who really gets what he deserves) and a slimy slob prison warden. Argh! There's no real point in complaining about this as they're just supposed to be easy identifiable characters for younger audiences to appreciate.There isn't really much scary about The Mummy, which is what the original was all about. Which brings me to the main problem of the film. I'm-ho-tep (played by the wicked-cool Nicolas Cage doppelganger Arnold Vosloo) is not really a bad guy. Everything he does is for love. Hardly the worst villain in history. In fact the greedy folks excavating his tomb, jeopardising the lives of everyone else for the sake of money are far worse, morally.The action is exciting and some of the plot elements, however copycatted, are imaginative and clever. The 2 hour+ running time seems to fly by. It may be unoriginal but there's still more heart in The Mummy than in rubbish like Underworld.The DVD has a great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture with even better Dolby 5.1/DTS sound.

49,The-Sarkologist,An enjoyable Indiana Jones type of movie,7,15 October 2013,"The mummy is sort of a cross between a super-natural horror movie and Indiana Jones. Personally I see the horror as being rather small and the movie focusing more on the Indiana Jones aspect of it. Okay, the movie doesn't involve Nazis but does involve evil undead romping about Egypt seeking immortality, but that doesn't make in a bad movie.Three thousand years ago, the high priest Imhotep (who in reality was a great architect who designed and built the first pyramids and became a god) was in love with the Pharaoh's wife. Unfortunately the Pharaoh did not appreciate people touching her so when the Pharaoh caught them the Pharaoh's daughter committed suicide. Imhoptep then took her body to the city of the dead to resurrect her, but before the ceremony was complete, the guards caught them and punished Imhotep to suffer the biggest of curses, to be mummified alive and placed in a coffin full of scarab beetles.The movie then jumps to 1926 where the action happens. A soldier, Conner (Brendon Fraser) stumbles on the mythical city of the dead and finds a key. The key is pick pocketed by the brother of a librarian who dreams to be an archaeologist (who reminds me of one of my classical studies lecturers) and upon discovering that it points to the location of the city, they save the soldier from death and go out seeking the city. The movie goes into a race between them and some cowboy like Americans, and once they have found the city, they ignorantly find Imhotep's coffin, and by reading the wrong words from the wrong book, they animate him. Thus Imhotep begins his quest to regenerate his body and then resurrect his girlfriend.I think the plot is pretty good. My friend did not like it for a number of reasons. One were the plagues, which were the result of the mummy coming back to life, but in reality were a sign of God's judgement upon the Egyptians. It is also interesting as the plague of hail is always fire. They were not in the same order either. I personally did not worry about this because I was enjoying the movie. I can be critical of some movies, but the plot kept me hooked and I was able to suspend my disbelief. I liked the mummy, and though the critics might rip it to shreds, I will not.",The Mummy

54,johnnyboyz,"Extravagant and sprawling romp through some fairly familiar, but involving, territory which encompasses upstanding protagonists; end of the world plots and slight romances.",6,30 March 2011,"The Mummy will begin in that old fashioned, mythical manner in that an off screen narrator verbally informs us of a legacy of events which prelude the body of the film; the tone that of an old storyteller, even fable-like in its sounding as the oral informing us of a time gone by and actions which happened is put across. It's an opening slice of narration that might just as well as seen its scripture begin with the line: ""Once upon a time, long ago, there was a great warrior....."" Stephen Sommers' film will go on to flit manically from tone to tone and from content to content; a harmless, teen-aged orientated throwaway action flick one minute, a rather hardened and somewhat full on horror piece venturing into territory you just do not initially entrust it will go anywhere near, the next. His film is a romping, old fashioned escapade through adventurous territory and old fashioned mythical sensibilities; a film with a foot in the science fiction, what with its content linked to characters able to bring people back from the dead and flesh eating monsters that do not exist; horror and post-Indiana Jones action adventure.The aforementioned story of the opening loosely goes on to describe a forbidden romance set in an alternate ancient Egypt between the then Pheroh of that time's partner and one of his entrusted high priests named Imhotep (Vosloo), something that leads to her arranged death and the sentencing of the priest plus his aides to live mummification, a process loosely described by one of the leads a little later on as something not particularly pleasant if we weren't already familiar with such things - although, it does beg the question as to whether it's even possible to actually be alive during said process for anything beyond that of about two seconds.Fast-forward from ancient Egypt to the same nation in the 1920s and enter the lead, an American mercenary named Rick O'Connell (Fraser); a brave man, a man with the ability to take control of a hostile situation as he leads a band of men against some aggressors at a protected burial site; to use an array of weaponry with consummate ease and who additionally sports an array of meal insignia on his tunic suggesting experience and expertise within this field – he is the ultimate warrior of the age, a modern-day action man eventually going up against the cursed; blood thirsty values and mindsets of that of the ancient. Also in Egypt, and not so far away, is Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz); an educated English woman working in a library whom outlines her credentials and skills to her employer purely for out benefit when he challenges her. She's a little pit perky; a tad goofy because of the mess she makes at her workplace and the manner in which she makes it, at one point having to balance precariously on a ladder.Her laid back and often amusing brother, named Jonathan (Hannah), then brings into her possession an artifact which could spell some serious archaeological ramifications. Following the obtaining of an imprisoned O'Connell, given he is vital to where it is the artifact will lead them, the trio set off for the deeper; sandier and more barren spots of Egypt to uncover greater truths about the trinket it turned out Jonathan stole from O'Connell, a trinket which is more broadly linked to that of the opening ancient Egypt-set story. What will come to form between Evelyn and Rick is a lightly played but fun enough romance beginning with O'Connell dismissing the moment he kissed her from behind his barred jail window as something which ""seemed like a good idea at the time"" because he was ""about to be hung"".On the journey with them, but in opposing camps, are some greedy American treasure hunters whom enjoy their gunfights along with their own English academic, who's sexist, and led overall by the weaselly, one-time buddy of Rick's named Beni (O'Connor). The two troupés rolling along dusty; desert terrains to orchestral bursts of orchestral music, MacGuffin in hand, as the sun beats down and the treasure lies out there somewhere, is quite good fun at the best of its times; although Rick's ongoing and somewhat inexplicable feud with Beni is hardly the stuff of Blondie and Tuco. One thing leads onto another, the eventual resurrecting of Imhotep spelling disaster for the rest of everyone as he wrecks his revenge on the world he still sees as the one that forbade his genuine love for another. The film engineers into a race against time against the seemingly indestructible villain, the moment he's got all his bits and pieces together to complete the resurrection ritual the moment spelling disaster for all.Sommers' film is good fun in the long run. It is the sort of film that has its characters crack jokes and break one-liners in the face of an apocalypse, and in light of people formulating angry views on characters constantly outrunning explosions or things that they ought not be able to in films of this ilk, actually has a scene in which it sticks around to see what happens to the poor bastard unable to get away from the proverbial danger: the result is less than pleasant. The film is not without flaw, but it's difficult to get too angry over a piece as self-aware as The Mummy is of the old fashioned, spirited romp that it is. Look at the scene in which the protagonist even identifies his quest as one in which rescuing the damsel in distress; defeating the villain and saving the world must be achieved so as to attain parity, labelling it ""the usual"". With a well-sewn romance manoeuvred into the film and a great deal of threat persistently looming over proceedings; The Mummy is a decent, enjoyable little B-movie adventure which above most other things, is at least refreshingly honest.",The Mummy
55,filipemanuelneto,A good family film.,7,28 April 2016,"In this film, placed in the twenties, an American with a mysterious past will help a British librarian in love with Ancient Egypt to explore an Egyptian ruin, but they end up waking up a mummy that threaten to destroy the world. Few people know that this film is the remake of a classic horror film of 1932, with Boris Karloff in the role of the mummy. The film is directed by Stephen Sommers, who also wrote the script along with Lloyd Fonvielle. It has the participation of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo.The mummies and their curses are part of movie horror paraphernalia since the dawn of cinema, but were eventually pushed aside for decades. This film, though not of terror but of adventure, made a redemption of these elements and brought again the mummies to the cinema. And there are hundreds of them. The film is excellent, it's very fun, has no dead moments and makes an intelligent use of the mysteries of Egyptian civilization to thicken the suspense in the plot, that is lightened by several moments of humor. The performance of the cast was also very good and the soundtrack, although not particularly surprising or memorable, do very well her role. The special effects and makeup deserves a special positive mention, as well as computerization and digital resources, because they knew perfectly how to enrich the film without dominating the attentions.This film is funny, smart without becoming inaccessible to the general public, and has suspense and some strong scenes, without being too strong for kids. So, it's a great family film, suitable for almost all ages and to see in almost any situation.",The Mummy

I saw it quite a few times after that. Tonight was the first time I watched it in a long time. It's really good. Besides, any movie with Dr. Bombay in it is good enough for me.

58,Ed-Shullivan,Just a notch or two below the great adventurer Indiana Jones,8,10 May 2020,"I must have watched this film at least three times and I always enjoy that combination of an adventure/action/mystery/buried treasure themed film. The two lead actors Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz had great on screen chemistry. I am a big fan of films that have that great viewing combination of buried treasure and the chase to be the one who finds it first. Add to that adventure film combination a little fun, romance and of course some evil villains and with a good musical score you have all the necessary ingredients to have a big winner at the box office.I enjoyed The Mummy immensely and will most likely catch another run of the film at least a few more times, so get on your camel, wear a bit of sun tan lotion and make sure you have sufficient liquids to survive in the desert and sit back and enjoy this fun adventure.I give it a strong 8 out of 10 IMDB rating.",The Mummy

It isn't so much the slapstick comedy, but the look and feel of the story. Yes, there is a more serious side to it, but when I first saw this in the theater that is the emotional response that I got from it.The casting is good, direction is good, the script has ups and downs, Rachel Weisz I think steals the show. She's perfect for this movie. Brendan Fraser is good too. There is a long list of other actors who all are great in their roles. Arnold Vosloo plays the bad guy/mummy.While the movie isn't perfect and some kids might be frighten by it, this movie is not supposed to be taken seriously. It spawned, four other movies, of various successes. I'm not sure what happened to Branden. I thought he was a good actor and had both a serious and funny side.Thumbs up.

61,Fella_shibby,Solid entertainment. The remake starring Cruise is so bad....,8,23 August 2017,"I first saw this in a theater in 1999. Revisted it recently with my kids on a DVD. I am writing the review of this as i was totally upset by the boring n lame Tom cruise's remake. Many compared this film to Indiana Jones n other treasure hunt films. Whatever the similarities, this film is pure fun. It is one of the best movies -- in terms of sheer entertainment. The pacing is good n the visuals top notch considering the era. It has monsters, thrills, humor and daring close calls. The opening sequences of Ancient Egypt are breathtaking as are the shots of new century Cairo. The special effects has fast paced skeletons, sandstorms, beetle hordes, fiery hail bombardments and hungry locusts/tiny monsters. Ther is little to think but plenty to enjoy in this movie. Director Sommer filmed the action in carefully composed widescreen shots, where it's always perfectly clear what's going on. If you're looking for some mindless fun with zero story, romance, good effects n monster fun then you'll probably like this film. The sequel was a decent film. The third starring Jet Li was a total letdown.",The Mummy
62,funkyfry,The Mummy is a decent modern pulp film,6,15 February 2005,"I was averse to seeing this movie for whatever reason, but I ended up seeing the second half of it a few years ago, and just managed to track down the DVD and watch it. I actually enjoyed the movie quite a bit. Fraser was excellent in the role, the supporting cast held up their end of the bargain. Mostly what I would note about this film is that it does an admirable job of using conventions of the ""pulp"" genre while putting enough modern touches into it to make a modern audience feel at home. Some of those -- particularly I remember my distaste at Fraser using a machine gun against the mummies -- are rather off-putting, but in general the film is reminiscent of ""Indiana Jones"" as far as evoking the old H.R. Haggard style adventure story. I would recommend it, with slight reservations, to other fans of films of this genre.",The Mummy
63,Anonymous_Maxine,"Actual quote - ""Rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world.""",7,9 January 2003,"This version of The Mummy (one of the several titles within film lore that seems to have been made and remade for decades) is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a modern adaptation of an old horror classic, especially given the types of films that are released these days. The action and special effects of the 1932 classic have been massively increased, and the new film turns more to shocking special effects, often cheesy comic relief, and sparkling scenery, away from the slow, creeping tension of the original. As a result, we get a fast moving feature that places a lot of emphasis on its special effects and it's good-looking stars. Thankfully, the movie knows when to laugh at itself, but it trips because it doesn't know when to stop.The film starts roughly 3000 years in the past, with the Egyptian priest Imhotep being put to a rather vicious death for getting a little too friendly with the Pharaoh's mistress. Naturally, he is mummified alive, sealed in a coffin with a lot of flesh-eating beetles (the sounds of which make up some of the creepiest stuff in the whole movie), only to be accidentally resurrected by a lot of bounty hunters a few millennia later. This is where the cast comes in, Rick (Brendan Fraser), Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah).Rick is the hero of the movie, the guy who has been there and done it all and just wants to get his money and get out. He's kind of like a cross between the single-mindedness of Han Solo, the bad one-liners of James Bond, and the adventure experience of Indiana Jones, except that he comes across more as a muddy conglomeration of characters like those rather than an original character of his own. He goes through his part upset by the fact that other people seem to be constantly be holding him back from some faraway goal, the importance of which they can probably never be expected to understand. Evelyn is there mainly with scientific interest (until she meets the hottie hero and romance is added to her To Do list) and her brother Jonathan is there for pure financial gain, as is the movie's director and crew and production team. There is also a tagalong character named Beni who I can only satisfactorily describe as a greedy rat, someone you would expect to meet on the wet streets of New York in the 1940s or something. He is a constant double-crosser who never has anyone's but his own best interest in mind, and so naturally ends up working for the resurrected Imhotep. His weird eye-makeup and pathetically whiny little voice make him a perfect candidate for the throwaway antagonist, who Rick tries vainly to save in a climactic scene near the end of the film. The interesting thing about the plot comes up when you consider when exactly Imhotep became the bad guy. Really, all he did was fall in love with the wrong girl, and then when he was brought back to life, obviously he wanted to bring her back, too. One of the first things that I learned in film studies is that the audience should know as soon as possible whether they are meant to like or dislike a character, because first impressions are difficult to overcome. With that in mind then, when exactly was it that he went from the poor love-struck protagonist from the first act of the film to the monstrous antagonist during the rest of the movie?My best theory is that first and foremost, he's killing people to bring himself and his love back to life. Granted, more killing would not justify the death of himself or of his loved one, Anck Su Namun, but considering the fact that all he did was fall in love and also considering the way that he was put to death, his reaction upon achieving life once more becomes a little more understandable. Second, what exactly does a resurrected protagonist look like? I must admit that there is something a little too daunting about trying to come up with a likable mummy, but Imhotep is certainly a man who has seen more than his share of suffering.The special effects are hugely impressive despite the fact that they are obviously special effects (the art of invisibility was not achieved very well here). When Imhotep is slowly regenerating, there are scenes showing his body and face that are impressive in their spectacle, but not impressive in not looking animated. As a whole, The Mummy is exactly what you might expect it to be, except that it was released amidst so much excitement and hype that it really should have taken itself more seriously and been more of a thinking film. It would have, under those circumstances, been immensely more respectable and might have joined its predecessor as a movie classic. It is a successful update of the Mummy theme (which has become almost a genre in itself), but there is a lot of fluff in the film that simply doesn't belong.",The Mummy
64,Vartiainen,Indiana Joned with a more tongue in cheek tone,8,19 June 2017,"Let's face it. No one's going to claim this is a good movie. Its plot is clichéd, the characters are stereotypes - and quite often racially insensitive - the villain is one-dimensional and the acting can be hokey. But let's also not forget that it's fun. It's tremendous fun!And that comes largely from the fact that the movie knows it had no chance of being great. So it takes its premise and runs with it. It has fun along the way and that translates to the audience as well. You can clearly see that the actors are enjoying making this film, so why not join in on the fun.The end result is an enjoyable romp through Egyptian deserts, tombs and bazaars. Plus, the special effects have aged surprisingly well. The Mummy is obviously CG, but in a way that blends well with the colourful set designs.I hadn't seen this film in years, but I still enjoyed it immensely even in this modern day.

66,FiendishDramaturgy,Fun and entertaining modern rethinking of an old classic.,9,28 September 2003,"What a wonderful adventure! This is one of my (many) favorite movies!!Let me start this by saying that badly done CGI, like bad acting, should be avoided at all costs and should NEVER be allowed to be included in the finished product of any production.Case and point: the Scorpion King from Mummy Returns. It was horrible; deplorable; and just downright nasty-looking. He was no better than the worst video game character ever drawn by an 8 year old in green crayon. Okay, that having been said, the argument in the industry is that CGI is taking jobs away from LIVE actors and giving them to computer nerds. That is simply NOT the case. Case and point: again, Mummy Returns. Do you honestly believe the producers would have paid two million extras the standard SAG fees and make up artists for these two million extras, or wardrobe for these two million extras to comprise the Army of Annubis? The answer is a resounding H*LL NO! My point is that before the diversity of CGI became known, movies lacked SO MUCH in detail. You either had the omission of the army all together, or about 20 shots of the same fifteen guys, all in different costumes, trying in vain to make it SEEM as though there was an army. Either way, what you got was deplorable. CGI definitely has its place in cinema. Another prime example of excellent CGI in use is in this production, ""The Mummy."" The opening sequence of the WORKING ancient Egyptian city of Thebes is one of the most awe-inspiring film sequences I've ever experienced, but Ancient History is a hobby of mine. The only time I have any problem at all with CGI is when it's badly done, as in the example I mentioned earlier. It greatly enhances our ability to enjoy the story when the eye-candy is well done and in place. Those shots of the Army of Annubis are simply staggering. They look realistic and they are so well done as to make you believe, if only for a moment, that they ARE real.The love story between Imhotep and Anck Su Namun is a classic, and is as historically correct as that of Isis and Osiris, and while this is classified as a ""remake,"" I simply do not care to compare this epic to the original hit.How can you compare a true masterpiece of horror from 1932; a time when there were NO believable effects, no mastered technology of CGI, and the standard SAG fees for extras was around $6 a day. (It WAS the depression era, after all) Since the development of the technology used in ""Star Wars, Episode 4, A New Hope,"" computer effects have evolved into a true state of art. I have absolutely no beef with CGI, its use, nor the use of it over live actors. As I have already stated above, my only problem with CGI is when it is badly done.In this movie, it was NOT badly done. I loved the ""Indiana Jones"" adventure feel of this movie. I loved the fact that they took a dark and dreary (badly done, in my opinion) original campy old horror flick and turned it into an absolute feast for those of us who love the eye candy. I am also an Ancient History hobbyist, and this movie really sparked my imagination. As I've already stated, the opening scenes of Thebes were so inspiring, I was hooked from the very first moment this movie began to play on the big screen.Brendan Fraser, to me, demonstrates his acting abilities in this production, showing his agents and all those around him that he is SO much above frivolous drivel like ""Monkey Bone"" and ""Encino Man."" I hope he never EVER has to resort to such a waste of his talents, again.Rachael Weisz is a sheer delight. Her character is totally believable, romantic, soft and lady-like while maintaining a tough interior personality. Not easily done. Bravo, Ms. Weisz! What an excellent performance!I will not detail the plot here, as there are hundreds of reviews already posted to this site about this movie, alone. It will suffice it to say that, in the Fiend's opinion, this movie is a wonderful adventure, featuring stellar performances and outstanding effects.

67,generationofswine,An Honest Review,9,25 November 2016,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. If anyone actually bothers to read my reviews probably knows how often I go off on how horrible and unnecessary remakes are...but the last Mummy movie was in, what, 1959? 40 years is enough time to wait. I mean, unless you're remaking Citizen Kane, Ben Hur, The Godfather, than a gap that long is appropriate. It's fair to remake a movie after four-decades, I was 19 when this one came out and my dad was 6 when the last one came out...so long as you aren't remaking a masterpiece, that's long enough to be kosher.The original Mummy wasn't a masterpiece, but it was fun, especially since it didn't age as well the 1932 version and even that, due to age, isn't exactly spine chilling any longer.In fact, because of the age and the lack of special effects and how fake a lot of it looks by today's standards, both the 32 and the 59 versions seem more campy than creepy.And the 1999 The Mummy keeps that in mind. It opts to go more for laughs and an adventure feel than real horror, but it keeps the time period creating a brilliant homage to the original and the warped perspectives modern audiences have on the horror movies that became campy cult classics.The result is a child friendly movie that adults can enjoy, but one that goes beyond that. The Mummy 1999 is throw back enough to entertain any cinephile if for no other reason than the dual references.It makes for a nice release, the tension vanishes and, from the start the audience understands that they are in for a fun adventure with elements of horror, rather than a film that is going to take itself too seriously.It makes for a light-hearted and fun film that's enjoyable for all ages. It's certainly worth your time for pure escapism if nothing else.",The Mummy

He shows the map to his sister Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) a librarian whom is also an authority on Egyptian History. When Evelyn learns that Rick knows the way to the ancient city she pays a considerable sum for his freedom and the three of them make their way to the ancient city. Unfortunately for them, a rival group have also arrived at the ancient city (in search of the treasure), but even more unfortunately for everyone else their combined meddling has awoken a Mummy that has been dead for over 3000 years. The Mummy (Arnold Vosloo) intends to use Evelyn as a sacrifice to bring his dead lover back to life...The Mummy is a fairly goofy, tongue-in-cheek type adventure film and that is perhaps one of its greatest strengths. The fact that it doesn't take itself seriously is actually one of its selling points - the cast look like they're having fun here and that does translate well on screen.I think where this film may run into problems with some people is if you start drawing comparisons to other films - when looking at it is does remind one slightly of Indiana Jones (it's easy to see elements of both Raiders of the lost ark and The Last Crusade). The problem is that it is weaker than both these films because it doesn't have the same tension to it - director Sommers seems to use goofball charm and humour to get by. Don't get me wrong it's fun to watch and quite enjoyable, but it doesn't offer the same type of tension or suspense that you get from an Indiana Jones film and naturally suffers by comparison.The cast are all on good form with Brendan Fraser making a good hero; he's not quite Harrison Ford, but he does a good job. Rachel Weisz is excellent as well and whilst she's clearly intelligent for the most part I did like the way that she had occasional ditzy moments and also liked that she was afforded some vulnerability (the scene where she was drunk is a good example). John Hannah was fun to watch as a minor comic relief character (kind of like Sallah in Raiders of the lost ark). Vosloo was very good as the antagonist, but in some ways the goofy nature of the film held him back and he wasn't as terrifying as he perhaps could have been.In some ways The Mummy is both unremarkable and unmemorable (particularly when compared to the earlier Indiana Jones films), but it does have some charm to it, some laughs and the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously is also a big plus. It's good for a one time watch, but if you want to watch a really good adventure film focusing on archaeological digging the you really owe to yourself to watch Raiders of the lost ark which is an absolute classic.",The Mummy

72,NateWatchesCoolMovies,An absolute adventure classic,10,3 February 2016,"Stephen Sommer's The Mummy is a rip roaring adventure flick of the very best kind. It's got that timeless dime store novel vibe and is there for the main purpose of entertaining the bejesus out of us for two hours of popcorn movie bliss. I'll no doubt get so hate for it, but I enjoy it more than any Indiana Jones flick out there. It's just too much fun, peppered with sassy humor whenever it stops for breath. Rachel Weisz seemed like a pretty grounded choice to play Evelyn, the flighty archaeologist who discovers an artifact leading to the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra, where supernatural forces lie in wait. Brendan Fraser in his pretty boy heyday plays Rick O Connell, the dashing soldier of fortune who tags leads their pack with riches in mind. Little do they know, the cursed ghost of High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) haunts the remains and has nasty plans for anyone that crosses his vision. Vosloo's dark charisma makes for a wicked antagonist with just the right notes of sympathy, and they really have fun with the special effects, as he turns the forces of nature against out heroes in fantastical scenes that rival Arwen bringing that river to life. The cast is full of hidden treasure character actors including John Hannah as Evelyn's cheapskate brother, Jonathan Hyde as a snooty historian with probably the funniest line in the film, Kevin J. O Connor as Rick's sniveling war buddy, Oded Fehr as the leader of a mysterious band of warriors, Erick Avari as Asa museum curator, Patricia Velasquez as Imhotep's foxy lost love and Bernard Fox in a chortlong, scene stealing turn as a drunken war pilot. Despite having elements of horror, the tone is persistently light, and flies along with terrific humor, swashbuckling and a sense of old world entertainment that can't be beat. A comfort movie for me, must have for any collection and a classic in the stable of 90's films.",The Mummy

The sequels are just not very good at all but this first film is a fantastic adventure with the once leading man Brendan Fraser at his absolute best as our funny but tough lead hero ""Rick O'Connell"" who is such a great old fashioned character & hero!!!
Brendan Fraser is so COOL here with his many guns & funny wisecracks & handsome charm he's such an all American movie hero, think a little Indiana Jones & Han Solo & any explorer hero from 50's B-movie flicks!!!
""The Mummy"" is full of adventure & the special fx look Amazing, the mummy itself is fantastic & scary but done fun at the same time, i love this film.
Also at times this is like a Horror movie with Zombies, Mummies, Killer bugs & demonic followers & the ""Book of the Dead"" i mean this could be a prequel to the fantastic ""Evil Dead"" Trilogy!!!
A great little cast with the BEAUTIFUL Rachel Weisz & the posh bumbling John Hannah & the cool but intimidating Arnold Vosloo as the main Mummy monster ""Imhotep"" it's a good cast.
I love the Egyptian locations & all the creepy dark underground tunnels & corridors under the pyramids, there's such a fun sense of Adventure & wonder here & there's lots of great scenes or moments, there's some Awesome creepy bits too that lead into the Horror Genre at times & the production design is Amazing as is the music!!!
Another great film from the 90's & still the absolute best Mummy film of them all.
There's loads to enjoy in this Adventure of great entertainment that mixes Adventure,Horror,Fantasy & Comedy together perfectly.
One of the most enjoyable Adventure films of all time!!!
This is what movies were made for, to take you on an exciting fantasy adventure & give you escapism from the depressing real world.",The Mummy
74,JoeKarlosi,The Mummy (1999) BOMB,1,21 December 2004,"CGI-infested, comical garbage ... an insult to moviegoers, or it should be -- because this idiotic film actually has its supporters. Mummy? What ""mummy""? All we get is what amounts to an animated, computerized, cartoony cousin to the Terminator skeleton that actually ""talks"" (!?) with a patented deep and demonic-sounding voice. But, mercifully, at least this thing's only on screen for a few minutes of this atrocity; the rest of the time we're pulverized with non-stop and ultra-cartoony computerized effects and inane humor, the type of which were so prevalent in American horror films of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, that it's becoming increasingly unlikely year after year that a decent monster flick can ever be made again.In his other incarnation, the bald-headed and very human-looking ""Im Ho Tep"" (who has the habit of elongating his open mouth extra wide for no apparent reason other than to utilize the rubbery computer fx) is a pathetic excuse for the title character, and Brendan Fraser is no Indiana Jones, despite his (and the film's) efforts to accomplish precisely that. The characters are idiotic and my mind was so blitzed out by the over-use of computer effects that I didn't even know what I was looking at most of the time. And the stupidity! I knew I was in for trouble the moment those bookcases toppled over like dominoes in that library.Senseless, plot-less, meaningless, mind-numbing, CGI-diarrhea'd, stinking rubbish. This kind of material was far better respected even when Abbott and Costello met their mummy. 0 out of ***",The Mummy
75,drystyx,"fun, but forgettable",4,24 August 2012,"The story of a mummy works very well in old films, because the mummy is a wrapped up figure, whose reanimation is scary because of the bleakness and strangeness of the world beyond life.Here, film makers make the mistake of trying to make it ""Indiana Jones"" adventure. It's pretty good, and it's fairly fun, but it's so predictable, and so cliché, it's hard to enjoy even for fun.Still, it is watchable. It just isn't as exciting as watching to watch constant barrages of mindlessness, that are full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, as it is to watch the creeping mummy stalk those who dare to soil the tomb of the dead with their Science.A week later, you won't remember much more than a few smirks on the lead actor's face.It's just not very exciting.",The Mummy

Granted, most people like such mindless expenditures to pass the time, but I'd rather be doing a term paper about quantum physics than sit through this drudgery of a film.Where can I begin. The dialogue was horrible, the special effects were Ed Wood-esque at best, and the story just outright stunk.How this movie turned a profit is more amazing than how the statues on Easter Island were built.

How could such a film with such bad dialogue, action and special effects make so much money? Is there some kind of research group looking into this! I mean, how is this possible! Are people really that shallow!How many more times will I use an exclamation mark in the review to illustrate a point! I could see how someone might be interested in watching this movie, simply due to the concept and idea, but wouldn't people be weary of seeing a second installment considering how poorly made this film was! Maybe there was a conspiracy by the producers who made this film. Maybe they had all of the theaters that exhibited this film turn up the thermostat, creating good reviews due to heat-induced asphyxiation! I think someone should look into this.

78,questl-18592,Mummy 1,8,20 August 2020,"Oh the days when Brendan Fraser seemed like he was going to be the next big thing. He was charming, charismatic, funny and made for a great leading man. Shame that never really went anywhere. Oh well, we still have this.The Mummy is grade A cheesy 90's action comedy. It's just fun from start to finish. Yeah, it's bonkers buy it embraces every bit of it and it's so well carried out by everyone involved.Absolutely recommend this to anyone that hasn't seen it. It's not exactly a cerebral experience, but as far as big dumb action movies go, this is wonderful.",The Mummy
79,aidanratesmovies,Brendan Fraser as that typical action hero,8,23 February 2021,"It's a decently entertaining spectacle, tat largely works due to its fun and eccentric storytelling and a charming performance from Fraser. It suffers some pacing issues, and can be a bit too silly at times, but all in all, The Mummy is a very unique and very 90's adventure flick that just doesn't get made anymore. One of the major flaws of this film has to be the pacing, because simply, if it didn't drag itself out, there wouldn't be much of a story to be told here. The CGI is also incredibly dated, although the makeup is done quite well for the time. Fraser provides a fun lead for this very macho action film, and Rachel Weisz as the clumsy female lead is almost humorous in comparison to her modern day roles, but ultimately not very fitting, almost forced. The rest of the supporting actors can vary from overdramatic to overly silly, but they all prove to be having such a good time while making the film, it's hard to really put them down on their performances. I'd say about 2/3 of the film is rather entertaining, with about 1/3 simply being filler. The story is interesting, and the plot easy to follow, the action scenes can be fun and intense, but really again, the film is just a bit too long. In the end, The Mummy is a very eccentric little adventure romp that should be as fun today as it was back then. And if you enjoy turning your brain off to just have some adventure type fun, this film is certainly for you.
My Rating: 7.5/10",The Mummy
80,Spondonman,Fun pharaoh tale,8,1 February 2015,"This has been shown by UK ITV so many times over the years that apparently similarly with the many other regular viewers it has become one of my comfort films to see repeatedly. A night with Die Hard, Where Eagles Dare, The Guns Of Navorone, Stargate, Time Machine and The Mummy all on TV would be a night of terrible clashes.Starting in 1290 BC in Egypt with a ""very naughty"" priest mummified alive it moves on to AD 1923 with a wise cracking male American archaeologist meeting up with a dotty female British one and her lily-livered brother to go on a jovial quest for an ancient tomb. Together with a jovial rival digging party they manage to unleash the forces of Darkness by awakening the less than jovial Mummy to bring plague and death. I hope Evie was happy with all the carnage her impetuous reading of the incantation from the Book brought down on thousands of hapless heads. The varied mayhem ensuing meted on the just and the unjust is sometimes horrific sometimes slapstick – probably kids today think the heartlessly graphic imagery laughable, but me, I'm easily horrified. However ultimately, it's a fast and fun adventure yarn for kids and adults alike with an interesting plot but with plot holes as gaping as Imhotep's gob, taken relentlessly and with panache to a noisy conclusion. The gags fall thick and fast too; it was Brendan Fraser's finest film and although Rachel Weisz has done better things they really made a charming screwball couple – without them sparking it would have been a completely different film. And I wouldn't have seen it so often either. If Arnold Vosloo lives to be 2000 years old he will probably never top his characterisation of the ancient baddie in here. So with some gruesome cgi cartoonery moments not for the squeamish but also with plenty of solid nonsense entertainment for the hardened majority there's something in here for nearly every mortal.",The Mummy
81,Spleen,May the fleas of a thousand camels infest the computers of ILM,8,1 November 1999,"Okay, so it wasn't a horror movie.  GOOD.  Why would anyone want to inspire horror?  Lust, pity, fear, joy, excitement, fascination, anxiety ... I can see the point of arousing THOSE psychological states, but what's so great about nausea and repulsion?  Horror, indeed.I must admit `The Mummy' doesn't arouse much lust, pity, fear, et cetera, either; moreover, it's stupid, which is more of a problem when the early scenes promise a minimal level of intelligence that the rest of the film fails to deliver.  (I have little patience with the turn-off-your-brain-and-enjoy crowd.  Anyone who would voluntarily turn off his brain deserves the consequences, including not remembering to turn it on again afterwards.)How stupid is it?  Well ...  The desert between Hamunaptra and Cairo is crossed several times, sometimes with camels, sometimes without - and, of course, Sommers forgets which side of the desert he left the camels on. Hamunaptra was built so that the Pharaoh, by pulling a lever, could pull the entire city underground.  But why is the lever smack bang in the MIDDLE of the city?  What good was it to anyone there?And so on.All the same, I recommend it.  It's not as stupid as it looks.  Before the mummy awakes it's reasonably consistent, reasonably well written, and, most importantly in this kind of desert-fermented cheese, it looks and feels good.  There's sand, there's Egyptian stuff all over the place, there's burnished gold, there's high priests ... it all satisfies a deep human need. We don't see nearly enough of the paraphernalia of the Ancient World on the screen.  Even Rome went out of fashion decades ago.  (Why, I wonder?)  So all in all I'm glad `The Mummy' exists.  It's not the best of its kind, but at least it's there.  And it's not just the content of the imagery.  The sunny wide-screen photography really is first class.That is, until some fool steps in and plasters computer-generated images over the top.  By Thoth they look awful.  A computer-generated plague of flies is no improvement at all on sprinkling pepper over the negatives; the decaying mummies themselves seem to be knitted out of a kind of featureless grey wool; the scarabs look like they escaped from `Toy Story'; and that quicksilver (or whatever it was) is such a hoary and ineffective old computer effect that a group of friends can spend an entertaining couple of hours compiling a list of all the movies that feature it.  What is it with these computer-generated effects?  Are directors these days even ALLOWED to make movies without them?  Is there a law I don't know about?Grump, grump, grump.  Anyway, even taking THIS into account, I enjoyed the movie.  I liked it so very much that I wish I could have respected it as well.",The Mummy

This came on TNT or TBS or some sh#t like that the other day and I had to watch it. It is about explorers unleashing the curse of the mummy, along with the mummy himself and having to defeated him in order to save the world. What I love about this film is how well balanced it is. It has equal parts action, comedy, adventure and romance. But what I really love is the mummy himself and his seemingly unstoppableness. You are more invested in the movie because of the difficulty of the situation. Whatever, this movie is awesome.

It delivers on exactly what it promises:horror, chills, nostalgia, good FX, a bit of tongue in cheek-what more could you want?Brendan Fraser is just right as the Indy type hero, Rachel Weisz seems to have a good time as the heroine, all wide eyes, pluck and screams...and the guy playing The Mummy, hey-he can squint with the best of'em.Personally I am glad this movie was made, and that it made 155M here in the US-showing an audience is out there for pure adventure/no strings attached.*** outta ****, a definate go see.",The Mummy
85,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,My Favorite Fraser Franchise,10,14 January 2012,"Director Stephen Sommers' version of the horror classic, The Mummy (1932), has been one of Universal's most successful franchises. It's also because of this that got Stephen Sommers famous. It also made a slew of other celebrities famous as well. And although it does not play like an Indiana Jones film, it pays homage to archaeologists and the magic within old architecture. Not mention this film made two more sequels.Starring in this film is Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Arnold Vosloo as the mummy called Imhotep. This is the first film that I witnessed Arnold Vosloo and then later on I realized he also played in two other sequels of Sam Raimi's Darkman (1990) series, which I thought he played really well. Brendan Fraser is not one of my top favorite actors but I do like the way he works in these kinds of films. I enjoyed his performance in Looney Tunes: Back In Action (2003), but I liked him even more in this film. The character of Fraser, Rick O'Connell has serious personality but in a goofy fashion. The rest of the characters in this film act the same way. Rachel Weisz's character, Evelyn can be klutzy at times and so is her nitwit brother Jonathan played by John Hannah.The goofiness is what's good about this movie. The actors know their characters are silly and that makes it funny to watch. The stupidest person of all in this film is Jonathan. Truly, he does not know what he's doing and in the end, he's never satisfied; shows you how grateful he is to be alive (after all he's been through). What also works great is the dialog. So much of it is serious but in such an indirect way that it doesn't come off as serious. I guess this was the idea of Sommers' mummy film. He wanted the audience to enjoy it with some decent action and funny one liners,...and it worked.The Mummy has a mix of multiple genres because how the screenplay is set up. Arnold Vosloo can play a pretty scary mummy; little kids will be terrified by him. The whole undead idea is the horror aspect. As for the silliness, that's the comedy aspect. The action is great in this film too. Most of it using firearms but it does involve an interesting flight sequence and the finale is really fun to watch. Seeing O'Connell fight off a slew of undead Egyptian guards. Bring it on! Or as O'Connell said sarcastically, ""This just keeps getting better and better"". Because 1999 was the time where special effects were really starting to get high- tech, this movie has some really nice visuals. Also the music is great which Jerry Goldsmith composed. I enjoyed this film very much and it really has a good reputation although less than half of critics liked it. Besides having a villain with the same name, this mummy movie is nothing like the original classic from 1932. What makes it different is Stephen Sommers' direction of abandoning the slow droning tone and mostly replacing it with comedy, action and some shades of horror.",The Mummy
86,eric262003,Horror Classic With an Indiana Jones Like Adventure,7,17 October 2021,"With a big budget on its shoulders, you may expect more from your what you paid for in the theatre. More neon-coloured laser effects, more dangerous missions in search of hidden treasure, more camels with bad breath, and so many dead people returning to the land of the mortals trying to bring us down. With an abundance of deceased corpses materializing through the vast deserts of Egypt, ""The Mummy"", it just seems like there are way too many restless spirits just wanting a piece of the action. Some of the walking dead goes full militant as they await full command over which side to take.Should these walking corpses take down these aggressive explorers who dared to invade the ancient lost city of Hamunaptra, located under the sands of the Sahara desert, or should they take their revenge on Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), a big, bald-headed priest who was persecuted three thousand years ago for having an affair with the Pharaoh's mistress and then burying him alive and being eaten by scarab beetles after the word was passed around. Now that he has been awakened due to the irresponsibility of inquistive, greedy and careless explorers, Imhotep has one thing on his mind, resurrect his long deceased wife Ank-su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez) and kill anyone who tries to get in his way. Imhotep makes the tranformation from a hideous decaying corpse to a hadsome Yul Brynner like warlord who can also manifest into a swirling sandstorm and devour airplanes. He can also magically unleash a plague of locusts with his magic breath.Under the direction of Stephen Sommers, he took what was an old classic horror character from the Golden Age of movies and brought it back to life. Unlike what Francis Ford Coppola did with ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" or what Kenneth Branagh did with ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"", Sommers decided that instead of making it into a horror drama, he took the route of adding some of the horror lore of ""The Mummy"" and made into an action adventure film in the same veins as ""Indiana Jones"", with swashbuckling action, solving riddles, escaping death and battling villains. But one of the principal similarities this mummy movie has in comparision to the old 1932 Boris Karloff film was that Imhotep believes that an English girl is the reincarnation of his long lost lover. In the 1999 version of ""The Mummy"", Imhotep has his sights set on the British, booksmart librarian Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz), who's fascinated about the lost city of Hamunaptra, joins forces along with her bumbling brother, Jonathan (John Hannah) and thrillseeker Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) who knows where he's buried after dueling with them during his years with the French Foreign Legion.Fraser is exhibiting his inner Harrison Ford with his witty one-liners, his unpredicatble sense of escaping dangerous predicaments, and his ability to fight off all the baddies that charge at him. The only big difference is that Ford takes himself a bit too serious when playing Indiana Jones and his one-liners are subtle in delivery. While Fraser knows this is surreal and his quips and banter is played through more comical effect.This version of ""The Mummy"" unapologetically looks and feels like a theme park come to life. Almost as though ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" being demoted to a more cartoonish background with goofy characters, tounge-in-cheek humour, and outstanding albeit surreal special effects. Though never short on excitement, it intentionally never takes itself too seriously, but still inferior to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" due to being more satirical in its delivery.The satirical approach may open the doors to imagination that bears no boundaries, the weakness is that the thrills have a more spoof-like effect rather than a more intense feel to it. The creep factor isn't entirely scary, however the scarab beetles is something that will make your skin crawl. Never mind you, these buggers have been enjoying eating the flesh off of Imhotep for three thousand years. If you go in close range of these carnivorous insects, they will have no problem feasting on your flesh as well. Of all the things that are horrifying about ""The Mummy"" isn't Imhotep, his resurrected wife Anck-su Namun, or the walking dead, it's these creepy crawling scarabs.Though I highly recommend this movie very much, it's still inferior to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but it's still very fun to watch. It's great that Sommers took a classic movie monster and recreated the creature into a genre outside it's traditional genre into something more fascinating. The performers make it light, though may be too light in its intentions, but something to pass two hours of your time.",The Mummy
87,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"A silly, fun and visually exciting adventure...",9,20 August 2007,"I remember back in 1999 (Eight years ago when I was about 11-years-old) when I went to see ""The Mummy"" in theaters. When the film opened to the vast spread of the city of Thebes, as a sphinx was being constructed and hundreds of people crowded the square, I knew I was in for something special. The film (directed and co-written by Stephen Sommers) has since become a fixture in my DVD collection. A movie I watch anytime I am bored and in need of a good jolt of excitement. Sure, the dialog can be silly, and the story isn't the greatest, and there is the occasional plot-hole or two, but it is still a completely enjoyable adventure that I personally believe will stand the test of time.We begin with the back-story... High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is having an illicit and highly forbidden love-affair with the Pharoh's beloved mistress. After murdering the Pharoh, she takes her own life and Imhotep goes about the task of resurrecting her. He is caught and condemned with the worst of all ancient curses, being mummified alive with the prophecy that should he ever be brought back, he will have power over the desert, invincibility, and the ability to control the 10 plagues of Egypt. (First Question/Possibly Plot Hole: If the curse is so bad, why not just use another one that isn't so risky?)Flash forward several thousand years to the 1920's. Adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is saved by beautiful Librarian Evelyn (Rachael Weiz), who hopes to use O'Connell's knowledge of an ancient and legendary city to be the first to officially discover and explore it. There is also her silly brother Johnathan (John Hannah), and several other characters who join them (including O'Connell's old friend Benny, played by Kevin J. O'Connor) during the course of the adventure. Also, the super-cool, tattoo-covered character Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) appears occasionally, to try and convince O'Connell and the others to stop what they are doing and leave. We all know what happens next. It turns out this lost city (Hamunaptra) is the resting place of Imhotep. And before you know it, he is brought back through the recitation of a dark passage from the fiendish-looking ""Book of the Dead."" And so the story propels forward, as Imhoptep stalks several of the disposable, treasure-seeking sub-characters who helped free him. Why? Because he needs to kill them and ""suck 'em dry"" to regenerate his form from mangled mummy to studly guy in a bikini. (Why is he in bikini bottoms anyways, other than to show off his form and look imposing?) After this, it becomes the classical story of ""rescue the damsel in distress (Evelyn), who is going to be a human sacrifice in an evil ritual""... a plot we've seen before. O'Connell and Johnathan are joined by Ardeth Bay (who is a Magi destined to protect the world from evil) to stop the evil beast once and for all.Sure, it may sound familiar. It might even seem familiar at times when you watch it. But the magic behind the movie is the fact that director Sommers is able to take formulaic plots (Damsel in Distress; Evil Badguy stalking victims) and generic characters (The silly one; the fat, gross one; the smart-yet-greedy one) and inject them skillfully with life and quirks that make them seem much more real than other similar films.Also notable is the lighthearted nature of the film, which has abundant (yet not overpowering) jokes throughout. This lets us know the direction Sommers wants to take... not that of a straight-forward horror, but rather more of a fun and thrilling adventure. Think ""Indiana Jones"" with more special effects and creepy creatures and you'll know what he is aiming for.And on the special effects... they were absolutely fantastic when the film was released, and unlike anything I had ever seen... And now, in 2007, it is safe to say that they have aged very well and still look quite good. As mentioned before, there are a few plot holes... Well, more gripes than plot holes, that annoyed me. For one, why do only five plagues occur when there were in fact 10 that haunted the lands? (Other than of course to save money on expensive visual effects and screen time) Also, why do the bad guy's cronies (pretty much just a bunch of other mummies) seem strong and powerful at first, then turn into slow, silly wimps when they encounter O'Connell? (Of course just to benefit the plot, but still annoying.) But overall, I think people will be having too much fun to notice, or even care, about these small problems.I personally love this film (And to a lesser extent, I enjoy the sequel ""Mummy Returns"" and spin-off ""Scorpion King"" quite a bit) and I still would recommend it to any fan of movie looking for a fun, fast and great adventure!",The Mummy
88,mike48128,No need for a 2017 series reboot,9,12 June 2017,"An incredible film that manages to outdo the 1932 Boris Karloff classic. It is pretty gory by my standards, as The Mummy rebuilds his body piece-by-piece and organ-by organ. Then there is the outstanding ""early"" unforgettable CGI such as The Mummy ""howling"" during a sandstorm of his own creation. They ""sort-of"" copy this for the new version. More plagues than even Moses had in his ""bag of tricks"". Finally, it settles down into a very decent swashbuckling Indiana Jones ""knock-off-type"" movie with no apologies for stealing that premise. Great and necessary female ""sidekick"". I actually enjoyed ""The Mummy Returns"" sequel far more as it is not as gory. The first entry is not for the squeamish. Almost a classic and I don't see the need for a reboot in 2017 by anybody.

The original is the best. Second would probably be the second one now that I think about it. Then the third one would come in last place. A lot of people hate these movies. I don't see it. It is certainly not art, but it is a lot of fun and like the others, it is never boring.The Mummy: B+",The Mummy

The film is action packed and has some great fight scenes especially at the end between Frasier and Imotep; the scenery is beautiful.

99,TheUnknown837-1,one of the quintessential action-comedy movies and a lot of fun,9,8 March 2008,"""The Mummy"" is exactly the kind of science-fiction action picture that I tend to enjoy. It is one of those rare cases where thrills are combined with jokes that ultimately create a realistic and authentistic sense for the atmosphere of the picture and proves itself to be a great roller coaster of a ride without ever becoming too scary or too funny to become schlock, boring, or even uninteresting. It plays itself perfectly, lasts exactly as long as it should, has the right amount of jokes (intelligent jokes), great characters, an interesting plot if not original, and is overall a lot of fun.""The Mummy"" stars Brandon Fraser as a young adventurer-gunfighter who has visited the sacred Egyptian city of Hammunaptra, which is guarded by a secret society who believe that a cursed mummy lies beneath the sands and if awakened, would be unstoppable. Fraser returns to Hammunaptra with a naive, but intelligence librarian and her brother, and oppose a rival company of Americans seeking treasure. Sooner or later, as the secret society feared, the mummy is awaken and great danger is set loose in the world.The special effects utilized in ""The Mummy"" are utterly convincing. Arnold Vosloo played the mummy in both skin and mummy form and it was up to the special effects team to elaborately convert him into this ugly, contorted, and frightening villain with holes and bugs in him. The mummy mostly roars like a monster, necessarily, and when needed, he talks in a growling, low-pitch voice that makes him scary. And no mortal weapon can kill him, making him a tricky foe to conquer. And of course, he's got his humble servants: more mummies. Not invincible like him, but still effectively brought to the screen.""The Mummy"" also features a fair deal of action scenes, most of them gunfights. The body count in the film is considerably high, and I'm talking about people as well as resurrected mummies. Because it's a fun part-comedy adventure ride, it does not take the matter of life and death seriously. So if a civilian ends up having to shoot a man dead, it does not seem to have an ever-lasting effect on them, but it should not. That would slow the pacing down and destroy the overall effect of the movie. And yes, some of the fight scenes were a bit ridiculous. Yes, I noticed Brandon Fraser firing a six-shot revolver more than six times without reloading, but seriously, who cares? How many times has that been done before? Dozens. We glance over them, so we can glance over this.Again, this is exactly the kind of film I enjoy. Even critics who found some not-so-positive things to say about ""The Mummy"" admitted that they were never bored with it. And neither was I. It is a quintessential thrill ride full of adventure, laughs, and lots of fun. Overall, it's entertaining.",The Mummy
100,baumer,At least they tried to make an Indy clone,6,17 June 1999,"One thing can be said for The Mummy, and that is that it is not boring. This film is obviously made in the tradition of Indiana Jones flicks and they at least made an entertaining movie.  But what it was not, is a good flick that would make me want to see it a second time.  Everything lacked by just a step or two.  The action and adventure was good but not great.  The story was fun but not superb.  You get the point.  If you have a chance to see this movie in a matinee don't hesitate to spend your five bucks, but don't expect much.",The Mummy
101,kevin c,YOU DON'T NEED A BRAIN FOR THIS ONE,3,12 April 2001,"There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is very poor. The acting is awful, the script dire; and the special effects overrated.Why does Hollywood treat it's audience with such contempt? And why have they made a sequel?",The Mummy
102,vip_ebriega,The best thing about it is it has almost everything you want in summer movies.,10,5 October 2007,"My Take: It's tons of fun and what else should it be? Summer movies have become too complicated over its last few years. But THE MUMMY brings back the old-fashioned action movie tradition. They have this belief that the old-school feel still works, and it really does. THE MUMMY may not be a totally perfect summer movie, but it's still darn good ""can't take your eyes of the screen"" entertainment, but the best thing about it is it has almost everything you want in summer movies. Whether it's adventure, thrills, horror, suspense and laughs, THE MUMMY makes all these formulas work and work together forming a delightful summer blockbuster that delivers entertainment that aren't just special effects.The opening sequence features, perhaps, one of the best and most convincing shot of an Egyptian civilization. It was such a convincing combination of model shots, matte effects and actual shots that its believable. It is perhaps one of the best recreation of ancient Egypt since, perhaps, the large-scale sets in Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS in 1956, which we now know is only made in a studio. This one was actually more convincing, including shots of large pyramids and the crowds and chariots. This opening introduces the Pharaoh's head priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who has an affair with the Pharaoh's mistress. As punishment, he is to be mummified alive, having flesh-eating beetles feed on his flesh.This is then changed in to the usual formula of old-fashioned adventure flicks wherein they must find the ancient lost city, uncover its untold wealth and leads to the deadly curse. Then they add the explorers' curiosities which unlocks the deadly curse and unleashes the mummy Imhotep loose on earth. Let the good times roll! The action sequences get a bit silly (even with the spectacular effects) and the storyline borderline ridiculous, but that's just the point. THE MUMMY is a throwback to the good ol' action-adventures of yore, and frankly, there's not much of them to go around anymore. Brendan Fraser (as Indiana Jones-inspired Rick O'Connell) and Rachel Weisz (as the adorable intrepid Evelyn), and some adorable witty dialog manage to occupy as much screen-time as the action and suspense. The action sequences, of course, are terrific in their own way. The sight of a creatures' face suddenly rise above the sand is some show of terrific special effects (and to think seeing a sandstorm up close is amazing enough).Along with INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE MUMMY is perhaps one of the decades loudest, most exciting, most gimmicky summer action movie of its decade. Just like the other said film, I enjoyed the film more than just for its special-effects. This one has story, characters and a celebration of screen excitement (all good), a bunch of elements much needed, especially to today's summer flicks. THE MUMMY, perhaps, may be among the few special effects-bound movies were I don't criticize the special effects, which usually becomes the centerpiece in summer movies. This one has story to go along with it, and, boy, was it a good one.Rating: ***** out of 5.",The Mummy
103,educallejero,"Ok action, but terrible movie. Tiresome even if never totally boring. Mediocre.",4,23 March 2019,"The Story: Not important. Everything is an excuse to move the plot forward to show the next action sequence.Characters: Impossibly shallow. There are no arcs for the characters. None of them grow in any significant way after the story.Acting: Lol. Rachel Weisz was still just a gorgeous woman, but absolutely awful at acting. The rest of the cast weren't and aren't and won't be any good, so yeah. The acting is the worst.Action: Pretty entertaining and the only thing that keeps the ship afloat. Probably less well shot than the Spielberg's Indiana Jones, and copying a bunch from it, is still engaging enough. But also overstays its welcome and ends up being a bit annoying after one hour and a half of the movie.In the end, if had not been almost two hours long, maybe.

109,ivo-cobra8,The Mummy is the best movie epic action nonstop ride!,10,5 December 2015,"The Mummy (1999) is my favorite true nonstop action epic movie!!! Filled with dazzling visual effects, top-notch talent and superb storytelling. It was the second movie i went to see in the theaters in 1999 with my mom as a kid. I was just a teen than I have enjoyed this movie a lot. The first movie in 1999 I went to see in theaters was The Matrix (1999) with also my mom and I have enjoyed both of this movie. Every time I am watching it, I still enjoy it! I had no idea it was a remake of 1932 film The Mummy. I never watched movies from 1938. There were spawned 2 sequels and one prequel/spin-off film. I love and I like both of the sequels on their own way and I hate the prequel/spin-off film. ""The Mummy"" (1999) was one of the finest Fantasy action adventures of all time. For the Mummy, achieving that level of serio-comic entertainment was unprecedented, and I still do not think it has been duplicated. All the witty dialogue, near perfect script, Dr. Bey... This was a very adult movie, but also for children too, and therefore accessible at different levels. The comments by Ebert, and co. were silly at best, as we have an example of critics turning up their nose at a great film, just to be 'in', be smiled upon by the academy, etc. It was therefore a poor review, a poor appraisal by the twain: this time you should not have used them. I am keep hearing that this movie is getting a reboot now with Tom Cruise in it but why? Why rebooting this movie? It is stupid! The reboot will fail, even with Tom Cruise in it and It will be rated PG-13 and It want be so good like this movie is. ""The Mummy"" is more Fantasy than Sci-Fi, and really perhaps should be classified as Fantasy Drama. Nonetheless, the rebooting of ""The Mummy"" by Stephen Sommers in 1999 would top, or near top, any list in which it is appropriately placed. ... And that ridiculous quote by Ebert & Co,, that this movie was ""the son of... the son of ... Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is sheer nonsense. This is to imply it is derivative. In a broad sense, all movies are 'derivative', and indeed so was Raiders. It does have a great amount of CGI effects, Yet there were real stages, too, I have learned: such as at Dracula's 'Ball': This was held in some Medieval Church, if I recollect accurately. I thought that the effects were good, though the viewer is perhaps surfeited with them. (...) Nonetheless, though bothering me initially, when I came to 'understand' this film, I look past it now. How much money do you want the producers and the studio to have to spend...? I thought was in perfect harmony with the plot, being grandly that of Good vs. Evil.This film, and unlike his ""The Mummy"" of a few years prior, is not 'immediately accessible' and does take repeated viewings to enjoy. This due to the plot's complexity, to appreciate the humor, and to appreciate the acting. Stephen Sommers did well with this movie but did very poorly with the GI Joe movie.I think people take ""The Mummy"" remake too seriously. It has great special effects that hold up pretty well, charming performances (especially Brendon Frasier, who I'm surprised didn't become a HUGE star after that kind of leading man performance/success. I mean he was pretty much was the Christ Pratt of that era and should have had the type of career upgrade Pratt is getting now. The dialogue is hilarious and very entertaining. I mean we're not talking a classic Oscar winning film here, but an irresistibly fun blockbuster that holds up well 16 years later. So the actors in this movie were good and the story including the directors were great. Everybody in this movie did a great job. This is one of the best movies ever made. It doesn't get much better than Brendan Fraser battling a 3,000 year old mummy. The action and the Special effects CGI are great. Brendan Fraser did a terrific job playing Rick' O'Connell a Legionnaire adventurer who served in the French Foreign Legion turned out a deserter and later a prisoner, he did outstanding acting performance as a bad ass action hero on the screen! Rachel Weisz as Evie Carnahan did an outstanding and a perfect job as a shy but intelligent Egyptologist. Arnold Vosloo as High Priest Imhotep and the Mummy was fantastic, he is such an underrated actor. Gosh he was even so good in Hard Target (1993) my favorite Jean-Claude Van Damme/John Woo movie. Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni Gabor a former soldier in the French Foreign Legion was just awesome and I loved his performance in the film. Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay the leader of Medjai was incredible outstanding. This movie is what it is a perfect Adventure movie a like Indiana Jones but a bit too underrated, that shouldn't have been. Deep in the Egyptian desert, a handful of people searching for a long-lost treasure have just unearthed a 3,000 year old legacy of terror. I am giving this 10/10 for been entertaining summer blockbuster action/adventure/fantasy movie!

110,juliankennedy23,Well worth the rewatch,9,24 January 2019,"The Mummy: 9 out of 10: A take on the old legend. French Foreign Legion veteran (Brendan Fraser) is hired by an aspiring Egyptologist (Rachel Weisz) and her brother (John Hannah) to guide them to the legendary where the Book of Life awaits as well as a rumored curse.Off to the questions.So is this better than Tom Cruise's The Mummy? Good lord yes. Heck, this is better than all but the first Indiana Jones films.It has been a while since you last saw the movie what struck you? I had forgotten how bizarrely violent the movie is. How it got a PG-13 rating is beyond me. It has a very light-hearted tone and very little actual blood per se but people are getting there eyes and tongues ripped out while others are having bugs dig into their skin and burrow to their brains.Any disappointments? Well, the special effects (particularly the bugs) have aged poorly and Rachel Weisz is not nearly as sexy in this as I thought I had remembered her. (Perhaps the sequel?)How is Brendon Fraiser? He is so good in this it is mystifying how he struggled to move beyond this franchise. He tried with Journey to the Center of the Earth but that film was more interested in some pretty lame 3D effects than actually entertaining an audience over the age of 8. But that wasn't his fault. Still, he was never given another real chance at a tentpole. If he was around ten years later I could easily see him in a Marvel Universe movie. (Or even DC he would make a pretty fine Booster Gold).So a fun time for the whole family? Yes. But honestly, it will scare the daylights out of little kids. It is also before the whole inclusion thing so those sensitive to representation and appropriation may burst into flames during the screening.Better than you remember it? Yes, it still holds up and it is better than I remember. A huge hit at the time I think it is often forgotten when we talk about iconic films from that era. Well worth the rewatch.",The Mummy

112,spookyrat1,Change of Setting!,7,23 April 2019,"There's no doubt the movie business can be an unpredictable affair at times. In 1998 Stephen Sommers wrote and directed a disaster/monster feature with fairly rich comic undertones to it. It was called Deep Rising and it tanked (despite this writer liking it) fairly spectacularly, though it has gone on over the years to achieve a degree of cult status.Now for some writer.directors that commercial failure may have represented the kiss of death. But in this case, not for Stephen Sommers. A year later Universal Pictures almost doubled his budget from Deep Rising and let him go and make what was almost the same sort of film again. Go figure. At any rate their intuition proved to be correct. Sommers remake of The Mummy, turning it from a horror film into a tongue-in-cheek action adventure proved this time to be a commercial master stroke and franchise starter. Sommers and Universal had an international hit on their hands.What changed? Superficially heaps, but intrinsically, not a great deal. Both films deal with monsters, The Mummy less mysteriously. The obvious differences are the settings. Deep Rising is water-bound; largely set on a disaster-afflicted cruise liner amidst a storm tossed ocean. Being set in the burning sands of the Eygptian desert (with Morocco substituting), The Mummy does appear worlds apart.But really Sommers just cleverly tinkers with his Deep Rising template, refines a few odds and ends and voila! ... finds out he has a hit on his hands.The Mummy ramps up the humour quotient and eases back a little on the gore/horror elements of Deep Rising. Kevin J. O'Connor moves from being a comic side kick in DR to being a comic villain in TM. John Hannah, comfortably fits into the comical shoes of Jonathan Carnahan, the new bumbling side kick. Arguably the main reason for the The Mummy's success lies in the lead pairing of Brendon Fraser and Rachel Weisz. They have real onscreen chemistry and Weisz, as airy, but also feisty and smart librarian Evelyn Carnahan, proves she has the comedic talents to match those, we already knew of Fraser. Unlike Deep Rising, where the leads didn't meet up till the second half, Sommers wisely ensures this time that Fraser and Weisz team up early in the film, so we can all more fully enjoy those rom-com sparks flying.About the only character actually keeping a straight face and playing an orthodox but very convincing villain, is South African stage actor Arnold Vosloo who is Imhotep, The Mummy, aided in his role with some well executed CGI. effects.The Mummy is fast-paced from beginning to end, provides plenty of thrills, spills and laughs along the way, along with more than a touch of romance. It's lot of fun, quite charming and never pretentious. But ultimately, it reminded me of the fine movie lines that exist between hits and misses.",The Mummy
113,fernandoschiavi,"""The Mummy"" is a great blockbuster film mixing adventure with humor in the right measure",8,4 July 2020,"Mummies, Ancient Egypt, mysticism, curses, legends are ingredients that have always aroused the public's fascination, especially as it is a very distant time for humanity that holds many secrets and mysteries. When ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was released in 1981 and we were introduced to archeologist adventurer Indiana Jones, success was immediate with a story that mixed action, adventure and legends involving historical and mythical artifacts. A few decades later, Universal brings yet another adventure that explores the theme, being written and directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Kevin J. O'Connor, with Arnold Vosloo in the title role. like the revived mummy. Filming began in Marrakech, Morocco, with the crew having to endure dehydration, sandstorms and snakes while filming in the Sahara.In 1926, a group of archaeologists discovered a tomb in the lost city of Hamunaptra. Inside the tomb found the body of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), the priest of Pharaoh Seti (Aharon Ipalé), who was mummified alive as well as having received the most terrible curse for having slept with Pharaoh's lover and, moved by sickly jealousy and love, to have killed Pharaoh. However, when one of the expedition members reads a manuscript that was found by the group and brings Imhotep back to life, he resurfaces full of hatred and only thinks about meeting his beloved and destroying everyone who crosses his path, bringing with him the ten plagues from Egypt.""The Mummy"" is a loose remake of the 1932 film of the same name starring Boris Karloff in the title role. Originally intended to be part of a low-budget horror series, the film turned out to be a blockbuster adventure film, with its vision of The Mummy ""as a sort of Indiana Jones or Jason and the Argonauts with the mummy as the creature giving the hero a hard time. Universal liked the idea so much that it approved the concept and increased the budget from $ 15 million to $ 80 million. This version of Sommers is very happy to develop a script with all the elements that a big blockbuster should, mixing comedy, mysticism, romance, adventure and terror in the right measure, counting also with impressive visual effects and a soundtrack that give a more realistic and imposing tone to the work.In this work, the director knew how to bring together that ingenuity already lost in the 70s / 80s, all the elements that make a blockbuster easy to appeal to the public, whether in the charismatic conception of the characters, in the sense of grandeur, a humor that he never abandons. the tape, or in the attachment to the climate of adventure. Sommers, at the time of The Mummy, a reboot of Universal's classic franchise, was a nostalgic. Establishing his atmosphere of adventure from the first seconds with the visual joke on the Universal logo, Sommers not only gathers all the visual and narrative elements that establish an adventure, but also punctuates his film with a rich (even if never deep or complex) range details, facts and theories about, fictional or not, involving archeology and all its symbology, which guarantees a constant verbalization of curiosities about ancient Egypt, almost a historical joke.The script follows only a few points in common with the feature film of 32: the mummy is called Imhotep and aims to recover his great love, which was also called Anck-Su-Namun and the fact that his powers increase over time. But Stephen Sommers changes a little: instead of making a tense film, he decides to go on an adventure with influences from pulp literature and with hints of 1930's adventure films. Just pay attention to the characterization of Rick, who resembles the typical adventurous hero from that time, in addition to Fraser sometimes being inspired by Errol Flynn. But what Sommers does with skill is how both in the script and in his direction he mixes these classic elements with modern elements in the cinematic language. Unfortunately, one of the negative points is that the Imhotep tragedy ceases to be the main focus of the story and ends up that the high priest is not developed as he should fall into the old cliché of wanting to take over the world. The viewer feels as if Imhotep were more distant, but such a change is understandable in certain parts since it is an adventure film, but the sense of disappointment is present in any case.
One of the reasons that makes the film work is its cast. Fraser and Weisz, caricatures in the right measure and talented in establishing their chemistry on the scene, clearly embark on the game and play with the interaction of their characters, establishing a necessary empathy for the audience to enjoy the adventure with greater pleasure. Fraser has great comic timing and screen presence. It's as if the camera really almost chases the actor for how good he is to be seen. Rachel Weisz shows herself to be an actress with a very strong personality and who escapes the stereotype of the helpless girl. As much as the character was becoming more badass according to the progress of the franchise, this film shows that only with her intelligence and because of the charm of Rachel Weisz the character was already interesting in itself. John Hanna looks great as the film's comic relief, a character who doesn't think straight about his actions and only thinks about riches. Arnold Vosloo, like the feared monster of the title, hits the antagonist on the scene, even though his threatening power is never really realized for the public, something equally hampered by the constant close-ups on the creature's digitized face.The grandeur of The Mummy is what first stands out. Almost twenty years after its release, and even though it is far from being one of the visual references of those years, the film still enchants and convinces with its creativity in the design of scenes, manipulation of visual effects and control of action scenes (how not to remember the wall of sand with Imhotep's face?). As much as Sommers is not Spielberg and despite his hand in some comedic moments that just don't work, in addition to some clichés abusive to patience, it is in the constant identity of self-parody and a relaxed atmosphere that The Mummy breathes its cinema identity that entertains an audience that, whether in the 90s or today, is looking for an adventure that is agile, lively, funny, visually exuberant and that brings together characters of great charisma. The package here is complete. These range from the type of humor in the film to more grotesque scenes with Imhotep, something that gets lost during the franchise by overdoing more modern elements like slow motion, frame acceleration and excessive special effects. But as Sommers proposes to the viewer a good matinee adventure film, he delivers it very successfully. In addition to having good scares during the screening and great comic relief from the immense charisma of Brendan Fraser.And as much as Sommers doesn't cling to realism at any time, the competence of technical work transports the public faithfully to the arid, dry and hot desert climate, whether by Adrian Biddle's photography that hits the color palette, in the costumes of John Bloomfield collaborating for the retro identity of the adventure. In addition to a very detailed reconstruction of the time, not only from the 1930s, but mainly from Ancient Egypt where the prologue takes place. Most of the feature's special effects work to this day, especially when Imothep is regenerating that he is not just a mummy that takes the bands off, but that he shows them along with his degenerated muscles and organs. It is really scary and distressing.The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, which mixed cinema and computer generated images to create the title Mummy. The producers wanted a fresh look at the Mummy so that they could avoid comparisons to previous films. John Andrew Berton, Jr., Visual Effects Supervisor at Industrial Light & Magic began to develop his eye three months before filming began. He said he wanted the Mummy to ""be mean, difficult, unpleasant, something that had never been seen by the public before"". To create the Mummy, Berton used a combination of live action and computer graphics, combined with the makeup prostheses and digital pieces on actor Arnold Vosloo's face during filming, in order to achieve ""a threatening and realistic mummy"".We also have the striking soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, which highlights the grandeur of that scenario and all the fantasy imagined by Sommers amid deserts and pyramids. Goldsmith's music, with orchestrations provided by Alexander Courage is one of the feature's assets. Like many Goldsmith tracks, the main theme uses extensive brass and percussion elements. The composer also used sparing amounts of vocals, highly unusual for most of his work. The composer changes the tone of the film very well, going from adventure to terror in a constructed way, never abrupt. It ranges from more epic themes with sounds of brass and opera to calmer themes of love. It is a strong element that helps to set the tone of the film.Being a huge box office success enabling the creation of a trilogy, ""The Mummy"" is a great blockbuster film mixing adventure with humor in the right measure. Even though in terms of genre and quality, it distances itself a lot from the 32 film, this film deserves to be seen preferably with a big bag of popcorn because it will be a fun trip. Anyway, A Mummy is so competent and honest in the gathering of its elements and in its imposition of great production that it becomes difficult not to be delighted with its successes, that for a film so open to concessions to the public, there are many. It is an organic, nostalgic and absolutely functional adventure.",The Mummy

I love the character interaction between actors Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz, with John Hannah providing the proper comic relief, Oded Fehr as the wise warrior, and Arnold Vosloo as an imposing title character.

116,swilliky,A solid mix of adventure and comedy with a dash of horror,7,9 June 2017,"The classic monster was brought back to life at the end of the millennium for a silly and fun adventure film directed by Stephen Sommers. A prologue narrated by the Magi leader Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) introduces the priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who fell in love with the Pharoah's mistress Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez) and was entombed and cursed. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is a soldier who finds the lost City of the Dead, Hamunaptra. He is allowed to escape by the Magi who watch the city so that the mummy is never resurrected. Three years later, Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) works at a library in Cairo thanks to a donation from her wealthy, deceased parents when her brother Jonathan (John Hannah) brings her a map in a puzzle box.Evelyn saves Rick from execution in a prison run by Warden Gad Hassan (Omid Djalili) who is promised a percentage of the treasure in Hamunaptra. They set out a journey up the Nile accompanied by another crew of Americans led by O'Connell's fellow soldier and betrayer Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor). The two groups dig in separate parts of the period. Gad Hassan discovers the scarab beetles and suffers a terrible fate. The group of Americans uncover the Book of the Dead and collect the organ of Imhotep. Rick, Evelyn, and Jonathan discover the juicy corpse of Imhotep. Evelyn steals the Book of the Dead from Dr. Allen Chamberlain (Jonathan Hyde) and reads the words awaking the mummy. A plague of locusts descends on the camp.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",The Mummy

If you are a fan of action-adventures or horror movies, then you will like this film. Brendan Fraser stars in his first action-hero role as one of many people who unearth a three thousand year old mummy and accidentally return him to life.Some of the scenes are slightly cliched from other action films, and you may notice some similarities in director Stephen Sommers ways (he is the guy responsible for DEEP RISING). This film is indeed one of the founders of the recent films in the action-adventure genre. This is one that will certainly be remembered. I recommend Sommers' other work, DEEP RISING, and if you are interested in action films, then maybe something like VERTICAL LIMIT or THE TIME MACHINE.

120,raymond-15,Not my cup of tea!,7,17 January 2001,"To be honest, this film is not my cup of tea, but I recognize that it does have some excellent features. Brendan Foster and Rachel Weisz make a great partnership and go a long way in setting the pace and maintaining it at top speed.Also, they somehow or other are able to link together a whole series of scenes composed of farcical nonsense.  And in the labyrinth of passageways where the scenes take place I find myself at a complete loss in understanding just where they are inside the pyramid.  But that does not matter.  There are far more exciting and terrifying things to worry about e.g. the bloodless mummies resurrected and in a fit of rage attack our heroes with wild abandon and the scarab beetles that can enter beneath the skin and burrow around the human body. There is danger at every corner.  The special effects are so well done.  Swords flash in every direction and legs,arms and heads of the mummies are sent flying from their scare-crow figures.  Our hero and heroine escape death by a split second time and time again like the characters in the Saturday afternoon serials. Anything can be done to excess and I feel the fight with the mummies is rather long and a trifle repetitive.  I wonder sometimes if special effects are ousting the actors in cinema today.  This is a mammoth production.  It must have cost a fortune to make. The most exciting episodes for me are the escapes through the corridors with the counterbalanced blocks of stone closing the escape routes. I admire the charismatic Brendan Fraser (so good in George of the Jungle). He handles these crazy parts so well. His co-star Rachel Weisz plays an archeological librarian who unbelievably does translations of Egytian hieroglyphs while on the run. What a gal!

123,Movie-12,"Never Convincing or Emotional, but with great effects. **1/2 out of ****",6,18 May 1999,"""The Mummy"" is a clone of the ""Indiana Jones"" series that blends adventure with plot twists and first rate suspense. While ""The Mummy"" does accomplish a thing or two with a neat computer animated ""mummy,"" it just doesn't quite work. It's like the old saying goes that it is one thing to respect something, and it is another to like it. I do respect the filmmakers who were hard at work making this production, but something about it was almost repetitive and never truly convincing.There is a story here, it often is unfocused and drifts off from a real point of view, but there is a story nonetheless. It follows the adventures of two brothers, a librarian, several researchers who seemingly have no recollection of consequences that evolve from their mistakes, and a couple other side characters that have no purpose in the film but to become a human victim of a non-human creature who will pick his prey one by one when they are separated from the rest of the clan.  See the formula we are up against; how can we care about the characters when we have already seen these so many more times before hand.The director is Stephen Sommers, who obviously prefers to introduce his characters, then start right off with the plot. We know this because his last film, ""Deep Rising,"" also did the same with its story. I don't think this method quite works. It brings forth many unneeded characters, who in turn we know they will be killed in the order where the whimsy ones go first, then the side character whom we do not know their names; the typical horror film formal. ""The Mummy"" is definitely an improvement over the last movie he directed, but again, just isn't persuasive enough to actually be recommended by myself.The setup takes too long for Sommers to setup. The narrator explains most of the ritualistic events to us at the beginning rather than show us, which makes it very hard to understand. The characters are well developed, while every one of them was obvious in their motives immediately. There are plenty that die, few that live, and a whole lot of boredom in the first twenty minutes while they are introduced.   And lets not forget the overwhelming, vast and good-looking desert in which much of film is shot in. The atmosphere is another great element in this movie, which is eerie and spooky, but never actually terror provoking.Brendon Frasier was a good goof in ""George of the Jungle,"" ""Blast From The Past,"" and several other comedies he has been in the last few years. However ""The Mummy"" is supposed to be scary, suspenseful, and shocking, not comic. This is yet another example of an actor with humorous potential putting it to use when he is supposed to be quite serious. Frasier doesn't even come close with hitting the mark here, mimicking Harrison Fords sense of humor from ""Indiana Jones,"" he just does not have what it takes to be a serious actor.""The Mummy's"" mummy was horrific in the most dastardly of ways. It was gruesome, scary and head tuning. I just wish that he looked like a mummy. For by the time this movie is over, the only mummy left to do the killing is a muscular actor in full flesh. Can't they even live up to the title?",The Mummy
124,anselmdaniel,Excellent action adventure,7,28 September 2019,"This review contains spoilers.The Mummy is an action horror movie that premiered in 1999. The movie is written and directed by Stephen Sommers and stars Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz. The movie is about an ancient mummy that is awakened and must be banished once again. The movie features an American archaeologist played by Brendan Fraser that leads the discovery and eventual banishment of the ancient mummy.The Mummy is a great movie that combines adventure and action. The movie can be tense at times and the movie is fantastic in its focus on the mummy. Imhotep the mummy, played by Arnold Vosloo, does a fantastic job. He offers tension and great action scenes in his portrayal of the cursed mummy. The movie is incredibly tight in its 125 minutes of running time and it uses all of it to focus on either the main characters or villain. There is not much fluff in this movie.The main stars of Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell and Rachel Weisz as Evelyn Carnahan do a great job in the leading roles. It was really funny at times following the band of adventurers as they find treasure and clues to unraveling the mystery of the mummy. Brendan Fraser in particular is a breath of fresh air at the time and created a great genre of action adventure movies. Evelyn Carnahan is the love interest of the main character but actually has expertise to provide in the movie.The computer generated imagery aged remarkably well for its time. This movie uses its computer generated imagery sparsely when it can and it makes for a better movie overall. The budget of 80 million US dollars shines well in this movie and it makes for an overall solid production.I would recommend 'The Mummy'.Grade: B",The Mummy
125,gigan-92,Never Before Has Brendan Fraser Been So Enjoyable!!,9,23 March 2010,"A re-make of the legendary 1932 horror classic, comes a film by Stephen Sommers and one of the best films of the 90s steps forth. Our director took the original story and expanded it into an even better incarnation of the story that people will be sure to love. It really adds a lot more dimension to the characters. Naturally, this film does not live up to the atmosphere of the classic and is far from surpassing it in anyway. This is a standard fun little adventure movie not to be taken seriously.Released at the turn of the century, I saw this film at a young age and realized what an achievement these effects were. They couldn't be better to say the least. ILM has never failed us have they?? Let alone this, we have a spectacular cast assembled here. Brendan Fraser has never before, or since, been so enjoyable. He was born to play this role I believe. Playing as his love interest is Rachel Weisz, beautiful and a damn good actress. As her brother Johnathan is John Hannah, who supplies his much appreciated comedic touches when needed. Being a well done blend of horror/adventure, it's so surprising the comedy works along with our mummy's terror scenes, which are imposing as one would envision. Playing Imhotep is Arnold Volsoo and the suspense in the film is played out rather well. Even with his sidekick Benny at his aide. Chilling scenes with awesome action sequences, Sommers has outdone himself here with this re-make. But let's not forget Jerry Goldsmith, who delivers a thrilling score. He really captures the tone of the film in his music, as he always does. It's a fun movie and nothing more. Love it, surely a classic.",The Mummy
126,Bogmeister,"Last word on the Mummy,until it returns",6,22 July 2005,"Colorful, old-fashioned, full of adventure. Yes, all these describe this big-budget re-make of the old Universal flic; what a difference 67 years make. A box-office winner, this capitalizes on the current FX capabilities to display almost anything one can imagine (as long as you have the money): wanna show a locust invasion? No problem. A 'living' sandstorm? Okey do-key. Essentially a horror comedy, the minor horrific elements are offset by a tongue-in-cheek attitude; probably the creepiest sections for the audience have to do with the marauding hordes of beetles that scour the insides of the burial grounds and have a tendency to get under your skin. The monster of the title (played by South African actor Arnold Vosloo, who has no English lines) is more like a force of nature, with many supernatural powers, who needs to feed off the life-essences of various victims to regenerate himself, uh, itself. The movie has some great on-location desert photography, with the whole thing having a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" feel to it. So, why doesn't it rate higher with me? There is a word, I believe it's 'derivative,' which can also be used to describe this romp. When ""Raiders.."" came out in the early eighties, it was fairly original, even tho it was based on old-time serial pics. By the late nineties, this scrambling from one peril to the next is not. This is also a primary example of computer FX used to such excess that nothing resonates with any real impact on the viewer. Since the story is set in the 1920s, I could hear in 1999 the wheels turning in Hollywood executive heads regarding a sequel set in modern times. But, that didn't happen - the sequel moved ahead only a few years, to even better grosses. Now, THAT'S Hollywood. Uh, The Mummy Returns Again?",The Mummy
127,moviesleuth2,A grand and immensely fun adventure!,7,21 December 2009,"Strictly speaking, this is not a remake. Although I haven't seen the original, I highly doubt that a movie made in the early 1930's could have this kind of action and adventure. Apparently it shares a similar plot-line to the Boris Karloff classic, but unlike many remakes, or ""reboots,"" this one is entertaining enough in its own right.The film opens in Ancient Egypt, where a priest named Imohtep (Arnold Vosloo) is caught in a love affair with the pharaoh's wife, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez). He and his priests are executed and the priest is cursed. Cut to the 1930's, where an adventurer named Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is about to be executed. He is saved by a ditsy Egyptologist named Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) because he knows the location of a lost city where rumors of untold treasure await. While there, they of course end up awaking Imohtep, and with him come a few nasty side effects to the curse.The best part about this movie is that it plays manages to chill us and make us laugh. There are some genuinely freaky moments, and there are also some openly funny bits. Not many movies can make that claim. Even better is the general adventurous spirit that the movie is filled with. It's just a grand old adventure! The acting is great. Brendan Fraser is a likable rogue who can fire a gun no problem but, as he puts it, ""I bet with my life, not my money."" His unlikely companion is a klutzy librarian who loves Egypt dearly (her mother was Egyptian), and Rachel Weisz is terrific in her star-making part. Likewise, John Hannah is hilarious as her dim-witted, treasure loving brother, Jonathan. You can almost see the jewels in his eyes every time the word ""treasure"" is mentioned. Oded Fehr plays the part of the native who knows all about Imhotep with a mix of ""adventure sidekick cliché"" and a serious character; it works. Despite being in only two scenes, Eric Avari steals them as Evie's boss who plays a unique roles in the proceedings. The only cast member who really doesn't work is Kevin J. O'Connor. As the cowardice, traitorous Benny, his character works, but O'Connor's shrill and croaky voice is extremely annoying. Surprisingly, O'Connor has been in nearly every movie with writer/director Stephen Sommors, so I guess Sommers finds something appealing about him.Stephen Sommers knows just what to do with his material. He clearly did not take offense to critics trashing his previous movie, ""Deep Rising,"" a reaction that I found unfair. Luckily, studios didn't either. Sommers brings his knack for action and goofy humor to this movie, and its more effectively used here.Other than O'Connor's annoying performance, ""The Mummy"" suffers from a few problems. There are a few continuity issues here and there, and if one takes this movie too seriously, they will realize that the story makes itself up as it goes along. Nevertheless, it's goofy charm will prevent most people from realizing them.Great art, this is not. Nor is it a classic like Indiana Jones. But it's still pretty entertaining.",The Mummy

And it was a great way to end the 90's, which I still believe to be one of the best movie decades; we knew how to make great movies and we knew how to make great trailers for those great movies--not just rapidly flashing scenes with drums and clashing and building violins, but REAL trailers edited to perfection with great music.""The Mummy"" just packs it all; from Adventure to Horror to Fantasy to Drama to Comedy, and in my humble opinion, it succeeds superbly in all five genres. It is just such a FUN movie! The sites (and sights), the sound design, the CGI (while I won't say it's perfect), and, of course, Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece of a score which can take Alan Silvestri's for ""The Mummy Returns"" to the cleaners any day of the week.While ""The Mummy"" was a blockbuster, it is sadly one of those unappreciated movies. Shortly after its release is when movies began to take a turn for the worse and become darker, and for what ever crackbutt reason, darker is what the American Audience wants. Audiences just want movies where everyone dies (a lot of the time including the hero(es)), the music is heavily synthesized, and the plot is simplistic.""The Mummy"" is an epic adventure from beginning to end. And I can only hope that our movies return to this movie-type some day soon. While I do like ""The Mummy Returns"", it was a little too silly for me. And ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor""? No comment. The first one just captures the fun-ness that movies are SUPPOSED to be; a movie that grabs you out of your world so you almost feel as if you're IN the movie (he said, at the risk of sounding either cheezy or loony), very much in the tradition of ""Jurassic Park"" and its sequel.It's just truly a classic, and will hopefully remain so long enough to see a day when it is appreciated again.",The Mummy

137,chrisbrown6453,"Well, thanks to The Mummy, the 1999 summer movie season officially arrived with a bang.",7,17 June 2002,"The Mummy is your typical special effects movie. It's got good looking stars, great special effects, a plot that is there to move the special effects along, and you leave the movie feeling a little bit dumber than when you went in. The movie opens 3000+ years in the past. The Egyptian priest Imhotep is put to death in the most inhumane way possible. But for some reason, if a person is put to death in this way, if for some reason he manages to come back to life, at any point in the future, he'll have the powers of a God. So why even give him that chance? Why not kill him in a little bit nicer way and not give him the chance to come back as a God? That's what I was thinking. So anyway, as you may have guessed, in 1925 a group of treasure hunters and archeologists stumble upon the tomb of the priest, and manage to bring him back to life. He then reigns terror upon the people and brings with him the 10 plagues. But with the help of a cat and a book Brendan Fraser and his crew manage to save the world, and get some treasure at the same time.
The one thing to remember when going to see this is that there is a lot more comedy involved that you may expect. It almost seemed at times that they wanted to do a parody of Indiana Jones films. So while it wasn't really scary, it did have a lot of humor. And like I said before, plot isn't really the reason to go see this movie. I went because of the special effects and the scenery. What I really thought of this movie was that it was a low-rent Indiana Jones film. Indy has better acting and a better story and a little more adventure. This one had pretty faces, some adventure, and good special effects. I for one am a fan of Brendan Fraser, even if other people aren't. Absent George of the Jungle and Encino Man, all of his films have been pretty good, no matter what anyone says. And he plays his character well here too. He does subtle humor very well. The leading lady, Rachel Weisz was attractive in a strange sort of way. Something is wrong with her face, I just couldn't figure out what. And the rest of the cast did their stock parts well. You knew pretty early on in the film who was there to die and who was going to live. The special effects were good as well. The problem with special effects these days is that we've pretty much seen them all. The trick is making them a little different. A movie like The Matrix takes special effects to a new level. In The Mummy, they use sand as their little difference. I don't recall seeing a movie use sand as their special effect before, and this one pulled it off well. The creature effects were pretty good, but reminded me of the Evil Dead movies at times. What I did like were the sets that were used. I thought they looked pretty cool. The opening scene looked amazing, even though they were using CGI to create it. The only real problem I had with the movie was that it slowed down in a lot of places. They would rev up the engines for a few minutes, and then slow it down. I realize that special effects movies are expensive, so they can't have these huge effects all the time, but it is possible to keep the energy level up without using effects, and I wish they had done that a little more.
So overall The Mummy was entertaining if slow at times. The special effects were good and a little different that normal. The faces are pretty and the scenery is cool, so if you're looking for a movie that won't make you think and will deliver a good time, this is one to see.",The Mummy

There is little technically wrong with this film other than that is clearly borrows heavily from the King of action-adventure, Indiana Jones.What begins as a treasure hunt in the City of the Dead soon turns into a plot that essentially goes like this, as described by Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), ""Rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world."" The good thing is, there is a lot more to it than that, and unlike Indiana Jones, the male hero is not alone in his mission nor does he get all the credit for it. He is joined by the damsel in distress herself Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her brother (John Hannah) who all want a piece of the treasure in the dead city. While the dialogue is typically sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek, it is not desperately punchy. It is probably on par with the Indiana Jones trilogy in terms of cheesy lines. But Brendan Fraser delivers these in a way that is so fitting that it does not really matter, to be honest. Fraser truly gets to shine and show us that is indeed best when it comes to comedy.This isn't Citizen Kane, but it's NOT 'brainless' summer fun either. It's just a very good adventure story even if it lacks originality. 8/10",The Mummy
140,theshadow908,Great action film.,8,21 June 2006,"The Mummy tells the story of a treasure hunter who teams up with a librarian/archaeologist and her brother so they can travel to the City of the Dead in Egypt so she can find the golden Book of the Living. Along the way, they come into conflict with a larger team who are hunting treasure. Both teams discover the Book of the Dead, and when the librarian reads from it, she unknowingly raises a mummy from its tomb. Now the mummy wants to use her as a sacrifice to raise his lover from the grave, and the treasure hunter must face the mummy to protect her. This is a loose remake of the 1932 horror classic, only instead of a horror, they've turned it into an exciting action film, and it's great.The Mummy is visually stunning as well as a well written and well acted film. It shows what ancient Egypt really looked like, and the sets are really great. The ancient Egyptian sets are probably the most realistic of any film. This movie is really well written and well paced. It has a great blend of action and comedy, which I like in a movie. The special effects are nearly flawless, especially in the scene where a giant wall of sand is chasing after a small bi-plane. The reason this movie is so good is because it manages to take a story that's been done before, re-imagine it, and make it an exciting action movie that never loses pace or slows down.The acting is really good as well. Brandon Fraser does really good as the treasure hunter who will stop at nothing to kill the mummy. Rachel Weisz is very good in her breakout role as the librarian. John Hannah is hilarious as her bumbling brother.Overall, this is a great action movie that makes me anxious to see if Universal can remake some more of their classics with an action twist.8/10",The Mummy
141,Rammstein-2,Back to the fifties,5,28 January 2000,"I'm surprised. I'm wondering how such a silly and inane film, with so much butchering of Egyptology, can be so entertaining. But it's all about the characters, you see.There should be a hero. A level-headed, strong and fearless hero who uses his brains only when it comes to trouble. There should be a woman with whom he could be smitten. And there should be one or more funny guys doing stupid things. And, of course, there should be a bad guy, a monster or, as in this case, a mummy.The trick is to make it work. You have to have the right state of mind. It's impossible to make this movie and be serious about it. It's supposed to be fun. And this one is.",The Mummy
142,Didier-Becu,THE MUMMY (DIDIER BECU),6,4 September 2003,"Well, we're living in an age in where old movies are remade with a bigger budget and somewhere that can work but most of the times it's just an excuse for having some special effects and really, from the moment they are too many it gets started to bore you a bit not? Some things are excellent like those crazy scarabees (insects that crawl under the skin) but other scenes are just a bit over the top (the scene in where the mummy evokes a dusttornado). The crazy thing is that this movie balances between good adventure (the Indiana Jonesstyle) and drowning into special effects (the Phantom Menace) plus the acting is really beneath every standard (Brendan Fraser just sucks and Rachel Weisz...well I am not even going to start searching for words, just bad) but all by all a movie you can watch as it is just too professionally made to let you fall asleep.",The Mummy

144,ozthegreatat42330,What a wild ride. The funnest Mummy of them all!,10,14 April 2007,"To start off with, this movie is not strictly speaking a horror movie. That is not to say it does not have horror elements to it, but they are, in a way, secondary to the main focus of the film. This is an action-adventure, comedy, love story. Brendan Frasier shines as the American ex-foreign legion soldier who knows the way to Hamanauptra, an ancient city, fabled to hold the treasure of the Pharaoh Seti I (father of Ramses the Great) Rachel Weisz is Evelyn Carnahan, a librarian turned archaeologist who has found an object that will open the book of Ra, an ancient text with occult powers. The rest of the cast are all excellent also, as the humor, the horror, and the adventure become a roller-coaster ride of adventure. It is ""Indian Jones meets King Tut"" in a way. I give it a rousing 10.",The Mummy
145,Trevor-Kerensky,"Not a horror, but a very entertaining popcorn film",8,18 December 2017,"I went and saw this movie in theaters one Sunday and while I did not have any expectations, it entertained me. I wasn't looking for horror (that's not my favorite genre) but it kept me glued to my seat. It's got Egypt, it's got action, it's got adventure, some funnies, and lots of Indiana Jones-styled thrills. And while Brendan Fraser may not have been my first choice for the main role, I think he succeeded. Still, many of my friends and acquaintances couldn't stand this film because of him, but this is one of my favorite underrated films. This and its sequel. But watch The Mummy and The Mummy Returns and skip the third one and the recent one with Tom Cruise. This is where it's at!",The Mummy
146,fil-nik09,Quite good!,8,13 March 2016,"Oh, I am some 17 years late on viewing this film but even after all this time I can say that the film does not look dated. It is very entertaining. The story is simple and follows chronologically the chase for the lost city / artifacts. As for the special effects... again, though the film is old I do not think that the effects seem dated as many people complain about in some older films in comparison with new ones and more advanced technology. However, some effects did remind me of the film Terminator and some scenes of Michael Jackson's Thriller video.As a lover of Egypt - especially ancient Egypt and as I returned from there a month ago - I enjoyed the film very much. I guess if you could look at all the things that are 'egyptian' with inscriptions and statues and figures... it may not be very accurate, but if you just look for entertainment - this film is great! Not boring and fast paced!I don't know where it was filmed, but I thing some scenes are shot in Morocco. Maybe I am wrong.Quite good, all in all. Eight from me!",The Mummy
147,rollernerd,Death is only the beginning,10,15 October 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Greetings from the dark...tonight's movie review is The Mummy (1999), helmed by Stephen Sommers who is trying to revive the monster genre with good old adventure. I have to tell you movie goers, this is one my favourites of all time. I remember watching this when it first came out and it blew me away. Guess what? I watched it how many times since then and recently tonight and it still does something that takes me onboard the adventure.This monster flick isn't gory but fun. Simple story, during ancient Egypt times, the High Priest, Imhotep played awesomely by Arnold Vosloo has an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti and there's a rule about this - it is forbidden for another man to touch her. When the Pharaoh discovers them both Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the Pharaoh and while Imhotep is dragged away by his priests Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse to resurrect her but him and his priests get captured and are sent to Hamunaptra, which is pronounced 'City of the Dead.' Why are they sent to this place? Well for their sacrilege the priests are mummified alive and Imhotep...well he gets the Hom Dai. Thousands of years later an English librarian, Evelyn and her weaselly brother Jonathan want to go to Hamunaptra for archaeological purposes. Both enlist the help of ex Legionnaires garrison soldier but also American, Rick O'Connell, played by the man the myth himself, folks it's Brendan Fraser. Simple story.This movie is great, maybe I am biased but let's see if I can convince you. The late 90s to the early 2000s CGI showcasing ancient Egypt is great, the filmmakers are on point with specifics for example when Pharoah Seti arrives in horseback, you can see his guards kneel one by one, the slaves building the temple and the pyramids. You have Anck-su-Namun in a fish net get up - wowwww. The mummified process of Imhotep is a great scene. The costumes of the Magi bodyguards from the past to the Magi desert guards to the present (1920s). The library scene with Evelyn, played by Rachel Weiz is slapstick and over choppy but who cares, you see her do a domino effect with the book cases. The battlefield scenes are epic and awesome. The sand making the mummy face to the sand wall trick by Imhotep towards the end of the film. The humour is great, you have Evelyn getting scared in one scene so she asks if someone is there by asking the following names ""Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?"" And the mummies!! Who doenst like a mummy hand popping out from the ground? And ancient traps - pressurised salt acid! Convinced?The characters are great, from the tattooed Magi guard Ardeth Bay (hint hint throwbacks!!) who has a cool speech of ""he will never eat, he will never sleep, he will never stop"", to the Warden Hassan's line ""he was looking for a good time"" and Winston Havelock - Captain of Your Majesty's Royal Air Service who wants to die by flying. Great characters played by actors giving their all which made the movie more enjoyable. And of course, there is the Beni - mate, this dude was funny as, even I was rooting for him! The scene where he confronts Imhotep for the first time and he speaks in different languages to cross reference different religions to save his neck, was funny as!! Jonathon who liked to quote Biblical references relating to the 10 plagues, Weiz portrayal of Evelyn was great by giving us a shy but intelligent Egyptologist. The character itself was great in bringing back the dead by quoting Amun Ra Amun Dei and who would forget what a place like her is doing in a girl like this? The actor who stole the show is Brendan Fraser - funny, Indiana Jones style mixed with soldier of fortune character. What he does best is he doesn't take himself seriously and plays the action adventurer really good. Like something simple is when he mentions how often the wind is howling is comedic.I could keep going on and on. This is a great film period, watch it on a rainy night to see what happens when you unleash a creature with a curse that brings terror. Fun and action packed and full of Wilhelm screams, overall 10/10.",The Mummy
148,cosmic_quest,Popcorn fun-- 1999's version of 'Indiana Jones',8,5 May 2006,"If you're looking for a deep, insightful drama into the rich history of Egypt then look elsewhere because this is not for you. If you just want to see a film full of fun, adventure and a dash of romance all set in an exotic location then 'The Mummy' is the answer.The story is set in 1924 Egypt where our hero is gregarious American Rick O'Connell, who is hired to take geeky English archaeologist Evey Carnahan and her wimpy brother Jonathan to a hidden tomb where they accidentally awaken Imhotep, a wrathful mummy who is intent on destroying the world. As the trio struggle to send Imhotep back to his grave, they are joined by Ardeth Bey, a member of the sacred Madjai entrusted to ensure the mummy never escapes.In much the same thread of a Nineties version of 'Indiana Jones', 'The Mummy' is has the usual formula of brave heroes and treacherous or cowardly antagonists. Brendan Fraser is very likable as the wise-cracking, reluctant hero O'Connell; I admit I despaired of him after seeing 'George of the Jungle' but he redeemed himself here showing he is capable of delivering comedy without the stupid faces and making a twit of himself. Rachel Weisz's Evey walked a careful line between being a bookish English woman without delving into being stereotypical view of the English. And John Hannah was hilarious as Jonathan with Oded Fehr's Ardeth Bay providing the females of the audience with something nice to look at! But it is Kevin O'Connor as the traitorous Beni who steals the limelight with some of the best lines of the film.'The Mummy' is a typical example of a Hollywood action film, full of thrills, humour, stunts and a scare or two. It's a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, especially on a cold night when you want to imagine yourself in a sunnier climate. Great fun!",The Mummy
149,Silverzero,Computer effects drenched excuse for a decent movie.,7,25 April 2003,"First off, I have haven't seen the original version of `The Mummy' so I can't comment on how the new version compares to the original. But if it were anyway above average, then it would beat this one hands down. Because what we are presented with is a poorly acted, special effects laden, and rather cartoony, hopelessly unconvincing movie. Now I'm not one of those critical snobs who believes that all movies should try to be cinematic masterpieces, but this is just plain childish for the most part.
But there is that one saving grace that only barely manages to lift it out of the dross- the computer effects. That was probably the sole intention of reviving this old film. But in fairness to it, the luscious landscapes and beautifully created computer generated images do compensate for some things, but not enough. The one bad thing that stands out amid the rest is the acting. Brendan Fraser was a blindingly bad choice as the film's hero. Mainly because he just isn't serious enough for the part. Rachel Weisz is OK for her part as a clutz, but does tend to overact in the worst possible way. John Hannah was yet another bad choice as yet another form of comic relief. He attempts to be funny but only succeeds in being excruciatingly annoying. Arnold Vosloo takes on the bad-guy role of the title. He's OK but it would have better had he been replaced by a CG mummy. Another very bad thing is the way that the film goes for cheap and rather childish jokes instead of solid shocks and genuine scares. It lowers the overall effect to make it seem far too much like a comedy than anything else. The visual effects only barely make `The Mummy' anything to recommend. The narrative, acting and overall tone are appallingly bad. But at least it's better than its disastrous sequel `The Mummy Returns'. At the same time though, this is below par. 4.8/10.",The Mummy

151,stormhawk2021,Action-packed adventure film,10,14 May 2017,"I remember being terrified when I first watched this when I was just a kid. As I've grown up, there are still a couple of things, mainly the scarabs, that make me cringe. The use of Egypt mythology was a strong point of this film as it includes Egyptian gods, curses and even some of the 10 plagues of Egypt. I admired the performances of both Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, especially how their relationship develops over the course of the story. The supporting roles from John Hannah, Kevin J.O Connor and Oded Fehr were also highlights as their performances very easily stood out, just like the main characters. However, for me, Arnold Vosloo's role as the cursed Imhotep was the spotlight of the film as his performance alone created a strong sense of horror and power. Even though there were a couple of good laughs, I felt that this film could've been better without attempting to be funny. Overall, The Mummy is one of my personal favorite Universal films to come out within the last 14 years and I feel tops off anything that the later sequels can give to the audience.",The Mummy

Unfortunately, somewhere along the production line, somebody decided to turn this thing into a comedy, and a bad one at that. This decision has to be one of the ten worst decisions ever made...Truly, the potential for something great was there, but this movie is filled with so many dull jokes that it becomes really annoying. Also, the main characters seem very reluctant to die and survive the most implausible situations completely undamaged. At one point, we even see a character being dragged away by hordes of undead, only to have him resurface unharmed at the end of the movie ! The corny jokes combined with the invulnerability of the main characters take away any kind of suspense and make the movie quite dull.*1/2 out of **** stars (mainly for the special effects)",The Mummy
157,dcldan,adventures in the old style,8,28 January 2006,"The high-priest Imhotep was in love with ank-sun-amun, the wife of the Pharaoh, when they were catched, he was condemned to the worst of the hexes, become the Mummy. 3000 years later, he is able to awake and he will do everything is needed to return his love to life. Meanwhile, Rick O'Conell and Evelyn (the ones who have awaken the mummy) will do all they could to stop the Mummy, because, if he wins, the world will be destroyed. It is a precious adventures movie like the best classics of the genre. It has spectacular Special Effects, too: the scene of Imhotep turned into a sand storm catching and airplane is superb, for example, and not is the only good FX scene... One of the best secondary characters is Evelyn's brother, the typical dumb character that puts the comic note in it, curiously, results really funny and it never bores in his not so selfish acts. In the plot there is something to show. How the good loving imhotep turns later in the evil Mummy? I realize that his death can make him a little angry, but it results a little curious. (In the second part become clear that he is not bad, but that he will not any effort for being good, he only wants to be with her love and the other thing are irrelevant). One thing to unline is the surprisingly good acting of Vosloo as the Mummy, without speaking almost anything, it results perfect convincing, and you can know lots of things about his personality, only by his actions. To sum up, this is a good adventures film to enjoy the time seeing a classic adventure movie, that can be condensed in three phrases: save the pretty girl, kill the bad one, save the world.",The Mummy
158,carlos37andre,"20 years later and the movie still looks great, but the story definitely lost some weight",6,6 June 2020,"I completely understand people seen this back in 99 and been blown way by it. Even tho it relies heavily on CGI in some parts (mostly the Mummy stuff). It's still pretty good, the effects pretty much hold up, I mean it isn't as jaw dropping as it might have been 20 years ago, but still, I give them credit for the cinematography and production design here, the movie was made back in a time when movies were trying to figured out how much they should rely on CGI, and I think this one nailed it, it has a great mixture of CGI and great sets, and special effects. And this is probably never going to change much, it will have this re watchability for years to come.The story tho, it's a bit basic. Again, I can understand it being great back in 1999, but some parts of it, like the lady who falls for the big hero, and they finally get together at the end, aren't exactly that appealing nowadays. Plus, I didn't buy their chemistry.Finally, I just think that the finale feels a bit drag out, the movie feels longer than it actually is. 1h40 to 1h50 it's a range that might have made the movie a couple scores better for me.Just to point out some weird stuff that bothered me:So, you commit a crime, a terrible one, and your punishment (besides the eternal suffering) is... to be immortal and indestructible?3000 years guarding the tomb... so when outsiders show up, messing around and going into your sacred place, you give them a warning (""you have until tomorrow to leave or you'll die"") and then proceeds to leave and let them unsupervised while there is a possibility someone might awake ancient immortal monster you devoted your entire life to prevent from scaping? What? And this is actually a main turning point in the entire film, and it's such a lazy way out, that transforms those cool ninja-like soldiers into some dumbass that failed miserably in the one thing they devoted their lives to.Overall tho, the movie is fine, it has some great action scenes, the Mummy effect holds up pretty well even today, and I like Fraser as the lead, he is charismatic. I just feel like the fact I'm seen it 20 years after, when audiences have changed that much, and we've seen the same beats in a movie over and over again, that the movie's storyline most likely lost some power if you compared it with the power it had when it first came out in 1999. It's worth checking it out tho.6,5/10",The Mummy
159,Mitch-38,Pretty Good Actioner,6,3 March 2001,"Seems to lean rather heavily on RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK escapades, yet has a few good moments. The leads are appealing (Fraser & Weisz), and the story doesn't take itself too seriously. The cameo from Bernard Fox came off as needless, as it was eyeblink quick and more gratuitous than most cameos. More young people were spouting ""Professor Bombay"" in the theater...God Bless ""Nick at Night"" or pre-press hype, whichever you prefer.    The special effects were quite entertaining, if not downright reminiscent of the choreography used in Michael Jackson's ""CHILLER"" video.    The baddie was exceptional (Arnold Vosloo), being menacing, but not over the top, ham-handed. His character was intelligently, and thoughtfully portrayed.

160,NJMoon,Raiders of the Lost Sandbox,5,16 October 1999,"How film maker Stephen Sommers saw Boris Karloff's classic 1932 MUMMY and came up with this confused mess is beyond my comprehension.  Despite being souped up to the max with ILM's best CG special effects, the only horror in this film is that for $80 million dollars it never comes close to being scary or providing a moment of suspense.  Instead, Sommers seems intent on aping the Indiana Jones adventures, with lackluster leads Brendan Fraser and Rachel Wiesz striving for ENGLISH PATIENT-like sparks that never ignite.  Scottish thespian John Hannah is dragged along for the camel ride, his reluctance to do the film showing at every cryptic turn. Even Bernard Fox, who went down with the Titanic (twice!), doesn't survive this pyramid of bad judgement.  ""Calling Dr. Bombay!  Emergency!  Come right away!""Over-long at 125 minutes, this overwrought confusion of action and comedy seems like angry siamese twins - one wanting to be funny and glib - the other intense and moody.

161,Hancock_the_Superb,Cool adventure/horror/action film **spoilers**,8,25 July 2002,"""The Mummy"", while hardly an arty movie, is a very good action/adventure film, with a cool villian.   The movie starts off (as others have noticed) like an ""Indiana Jones"" film, and could very well be one.  From the prologue set in ancient Egypt (setting the background for our bad guy) and the opening battle scene (between the Tuaregs and the French Foreign Legion [?]) to the last scene as the four survivors ride off into the sunset, this is exciting, non-stop.   Well, the basic plot goes: an American mercenary (Brendan Fraiser) fighting somewhere in Africa (here is a continuity problem, I guess; if you're well-read, the Tuaregs live in Algieria, Morrocco, Western Sahara, and Nigeria [though Fraiser mentions being in Libya, which was a Turkish/Italian colony anyway]) gets cornered by his Tuareg adversaries. Just as they're about to kill him, their horses suddenly go wild, and a huge face appears in the sand.     Later, librarian Evy Carnahan (Rachiel Weisz) hires Fraiser to help her locate Hapunatra (sp.?), the city of the dead.  With another team of Americans (led by Beni, Fraiser's ""friend"" from the Foreign Legion), they find the city, only to let loose Imhotep (Arnold Voosloo), a vampiric creature who must suck the organs from those who were present at the opening of his tomb.  His goal: to resurrect mistress Anuck-Sun-Ahumn (Patricia Velazquez), using Evy as a sacrifice, with Fraiser, Evy's brother Jonathan (John Hannah), mysterious cult leader (and initially the bad guy) Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), and British RAF veteran Winston Havelot (Edward Fox) in hot persuit.  There's enough bugs, gunbattles, action, romance, one-liners, organ-sucking, sword fights, undead mummies, and suspense to keep you interested for quite a while.   Very good.

It lies somewhere between a B grade and a C grade. It starts off okay and from the get go you know these guys are trying to recreate the Indiana Jones vibes. But it moreover feels like a cheap parody of it. So yeah, only the start of the film has some very okayish scenes. Well they're at least bearable unlike the rest of the film. The action scenes are poorly choreographed, story is extremely childish and uninteresting and even the visual effects are absolutely bad. The film also contains many problematic scenes/lines which would have totally got this film canceled if it released today.

For many, the word ""adventure movie"" is equal to ""Indiana Jones"", but not for me, because my acquaintance with the adventure genre began with ""The Mummy"", when I was small, and often ill, and in order to brighten up my leisure time I took out a VHC cassette and was the first and the second ""Mummy"" - and enjoyed the spectacle. I watched the first part countless times, and since now I was struck by nostalgia - instead of ""Meeting on the Elbe"" I will write reviews on the ""Mummy"" trilogy, and I wanted to start with the first part. And here's my quick opinion - Favorite childhood adventure film. The review will be subjective, but, in addition to the advantages of this picture, I simply have to mention the disadvantages, which could not be avoided. Then I ask you to brew a tea, cover yourself with a blanket (for it has already snowed on the street), and enjoy the review of this low-budget horror movie, which has turned into an excellent adventure blockbuster.
So the pros:
1. Scenario - the picture will tell us the story of Rick O'Connell and a group of reluctant adventurers who ""purely in scientific interests"" found in the Egyptian sands what they shouldn't have, and moreover, by their actions they were able to revive the mummy, which intends to bring about the literal End Sveta. Familiar types: the main character gloomy with a bad sense of humor, a fragile girl, a humorist, a cowardly villain from the protagonist's past, greedy rivals. Not without ancient curses. A classic adventure story with an obvious ending, where there are frightening elements that do not scare me at all in childhood and now, but complement the atmosphere. The script is good, and they clearly worked on it, because the director himself, Stephen Sommers, was responsible for it. Not without jambs, but I will praise, because I was very generous when watching.
2. Atmosphere - Egyptian theme is quite famous, and this picture is filled with it almost completely. Curses, rituals, a little history (albeit altered to suit the script). If you love this theme, then you will definitely enjoy this picture.
3. Humor - it fits perfectly here. It seems that the jokes are unpretentious and were written clearly without straining, but for some reason they work. The creators respect their viewer (unlike today) and did not insert vile or frankly wretched jokes. I got tremendous pleasure from humor.
4. Fights, chases, shootings - the budget of the picture was eighty million cabbage leaves, and most of them were clearly spent on staging and shooting these scenes. You enjoy them, you enjoy them, and they look great even now, twenty-one years after their release. And the spectacle, and tactics, and adrenaline flows through the veins. Delightful!
5. Charismatic heroes - each of whom is remembered, each has its own motives and you believe in them. And although the types are beaten, they do not get worse from this.
6. Romantic line - you can consider me a boring person, but I liked it and I was damn happy for the characters.
7. Music - pretentious, with a touch of Ancient Egypt, mysterious, frightening, atmospheric, dynamic, emotional - all this can be said about the musical accompaniment of this picture. Pure pleasure!
So the cons:
1. Logic - which in some moments clearly did not spend the night, but went to skip the money given by the creators of the picture. Lyapov and nonsense are enough here, but I did not pay attention to this in childhood, but now I noticed. But even so, I forgive the picture for these jambs.
2. Special effects - most of them look great today, but not everywhere and not in all frames. What to do - time is a ruthless thing.
A little about the main characters:
1. Rick O'Connell, played by Brendan Fraser, is a former officer with the secret of finding a forgotten city in the sands, who becomes a guide and hero. An experienced fighter and charismatic adventurer, not devoid of nobility and good manners. Brendan Fraser is the perfect fit. Bravo Brendan!
2. Evelyn (Evie) Carnahan performed by Rachel Weisz is a fragile girl who is not as simple as it seems at first glance. Beauty Rachel - as a child I loved her and considered her the ideal of a woman, well, my favorite actress at the same time. But ruthless time changes a lot, and it got to Rachel. But in this role and in this picture, she is still young and attractive, and beautiful to the point of creeping on her skin, so Bravo!
3. Ardet Bey performed by Oded Fera - the leader of an ancient order that guards the forgotten city in the sands and its secrets. A brave and noble warrior, whose help the heroes will definitely come in handy. Just think - an Israeli actor (Jewish) played an Arab warrior (Muslim) so convincingly that I sincerely thought that the creators had hired a local actor. This is reincarnation. Definitely my favorite mountain of the second plan (after Jonathan of course).
I can't help but mention John Hannah as Jonathan, our main comedian, and Arnold Vosloo as The Mummy, who was damn convincing.
Since the picture with its budget collected almost half a billion cabbage leaves, the release of the continuation was only a matter of time, and in 2001 it came out, and I like it no less than this picture, and expect a review for the second part soon.
How miserable against the background of this picture is the ""Mummy"" of 2017 with Tomka Cruise.
And a little advice - reading books does not always lead to good.
As a result, we have an excellent adventure movie with an excellent script, great music and atmosphere, good humor and great acting.",The Mummy
166,mr_popcorn,Quite alright,7,11 April 2008,"I'll give this one a solid six. Yes, I enjoyed it quite a lot but there's something that makes this film forgettable. The action was decent, the story was there and the acting were above average. Brendan Fraser as wily adventurer Rick O' Connell is very much like Indiana Jones.Every time I saw him on screen I can't get Indiana Jones out of my head. His portrayal was fairly effective but the thought of him being an Indiana Jones character cannot be avoided.I enjoyed it yes, but this one I will probably forget in a day or two. 6 stars.(I wonder how The Mummy 3 will turn out, its not set in the desert btw)",The Mummy
167,XhoXhuXhamen,"Laughs, Thrills, Romance, And Adventure. Isn't That What You Came For?",10,1 May 2021,"Plot smot! Who cares if the plot is silly. Who cares if some of the dialogue is cheesy. What HollyWeird film is Cheese Free? None! But if you're looking for some good old fashioned fun, then The Mummy is for you. For one, there's a tomb with a mummy. For two, there's some people that find it. For three, some really bad stuff happens after they accidentally let the mummy out of the tomb. And then some strange guys on horseback arrive. And then some more shooting begins. What fun!",The Mummy
168,Meredith-7,Exciting adventure yarn,8,31 July 1999,"I had heard mixed reviews of this film before I went and saw it for myself. I thought it looked good, but heaps of people kept telling me how bad it was.  Eventually, when i did see it I was really surprised because it was so enjoyable.  The cast is excellent, the special effects are really very good and the story- well its typical, not to original but enjoyable.  Obviously this was a totally different angle of the mummy theme, especially when compared to other films where an actor wrapped in cotton strips terrorises people who disturbed his resting place.  O.K so the bare essentials of the story are similar, but the actual way they do it is totally different to all the other 'Mummys curse' films.  Great locations also add extra flavour to the film.  I cant say that it was scary, but it was still interesting to watch.  I'd see it again without hesitation.  A *** out of ****",The Mummy
169,andy-227,Not great. But still entertaining!,4,16 May 1999,"Oh boy, here we go again.  Another special effects bonanza.  Only this time, I had a little more fun with this.  ""Godzilla"" was a bore, and I feared that this film would suffer the same fate.  Astonishingly, it didn't.  I didn't quite care for the characters, except for Branden Fraser, and the guy who plays the mummy.  Both of them, along with the wild ride of special effects, help hold our attention for a good 2 hours or so.  For the first 5 minutes, I couldn't figure how or why the things that happened in the film did. But, after you get wound up in the film, meaning no longer matters.  There's not much to say about it, only that it was fun.  It didn't do as much for me as ""The Matrix"" did, but this was still cool!",The Mummy
170,TuckMN,This one has EVERYTHING,7,12 May 1999,"Brendan Fraser is the logical successor to Harrison Ford as the screen's newest action star.He has everything -- and he can actually act.He proved it in ""Gods and Monsters"" but now he shows he can do action movies too.There was a lot of humour in this movie -- kind of ""Indiana Jones meets the Three Stooges"" but it didn't detract from the story -- it just made it a lot more fun.The copious special effects added a lot to this tale of greed, mystery, and blunders.While this is not as great as the Indiana Jones films -- it is still a pretty good movie.",The Mummy
171,len-21,7 on a scale of 10,7,20 May 1999,"This movie easily warrants an 8 as a rating, but I only gave it a 7. The reason is simply because we have seen it all before. It is extremely similar to The Raiders of the Lost Ark series.The differences are that Harrison Ford was a much more likable, charismatic hero. The special effects, though dazzling, were actually overdone. The simplicity of the special effects in Raiders was part of what made it so enjoyable. Afterall, the movie takes place in the 1920's or 30's. It seems a little bit like putting ketchup on ice cream to me.All in all it was good and well worth seeing. There are too many problems with the plot to give it more than a 7 even if I hadn't seen ""it"" before. Let's see, 10 plagues. OK, here goes. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6..., and ""last but not least"" . New math, I guess.",The Mummy
172,BrickNash,True cinematic entertainment!,10,2 June 2013,"The Mummy is without a doubt absolutely everything that embodies the term 'Hollywood'What we have here is a slick, fast paced, funny and action packed film full of mystique and wonder.To start with the film looks amazingly lush with it's golden hue running throughout. Everything is spot on from the lighting to the sets right down to the last dusty detail. The CGI may not be as high resolution as today's standards but it still looks absolutely tremendous and really suits the tone of the film.The plot is a pretty obvious homage to the Indiana Jones series but it not once falls foul of plagiarism and instead takes the idea and expands on it so much as to make it truly it's own film. Fraser is great as the Indy type adventurer and paired with the stunning Rachel Weiss the pair have a great on screen chemistry that's nicely bounced off of John Hannah and Omid Djalili's comic characters.Writer/director Steven Somers manages to give the characters some genuinely snappy and funny dialogue and the action comes in boatloads but is never gruesome, gratuitous or falls back on gore which is actually a very hard thing to do especially in these days of de- sensitivity when everything has to be harsher.I simply can't praise this film enough, it's just pure cinematic entertainment full of thrills, spills, romance and visuals. It's strange that The Mummy actually comes off as a much better film of the genre than Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull since the latter series basically created the genre.One of the rare treats to come from a director and team who really believe in what they are doing, and it shows!",The Mummy
173,tapio_hietamaki,Predictable but entertaining adventure comedy,7,23 March 2017,"Indiana Jones is stupid, fun camp adventure, and so is 'The Mummy', but at least Indy was 80's camp whereas 'The Mummy' is 90's camp. 1990's adventure comedy is the worst. There's cultural stereotypes and chauvinist jokes aplenty, stupid slapstick, pointless characters (their only purpose being a silly death scene), the plot is contrived and predictable and there is no research into actual Egyptian mythology.Still, it's entertaining. Rachel Weisz is beautiful (though incompetent and hopelessly in love with the macho protagonist), Brendan Fraser shines as a scoundrel hero and the movie mixes horror tropes into the adventure which is always fun.The CGI mummy is a little dated. Boris Karloff's powerful and frightening mummy looked better, though the movie he starred in was much more boring than this one.",The Mummy
174,iguth,Classic adventure,8,2 June 2019,"The Mummy is a classic that does not get the respect it deserves. It is the epicenter of the adventure drama comparable to that of Indiana Jones. Brendan Fraser in his prime is a dream and as much as I'd like to say that this is a ""find the treasure get the girl"" film, our lead actress is so independent in her drive. Jonathan is fun, there is a lot of friendly banter and the plot revolving around the mummy is well done. The temple is like Indiana Jones with just the right amount of fantasy vs. ancient Egypt. I is pretty surface level but a classic nonetheless. Gotta see it.",The Mummy
175,Barky44,"Campy, but a lot of fun!",9,28 March 2005,"The Mummy is an effects-laden re-manufacture of the classic Mummy tale. It's an action movie, not a horror movie. Although there are some creepy parts, by an large this is a standard, shoot-em-up, monster movie. And that's just fine.When you take it for what it is, it's a lot of fun. The visuals are stunning, the effects are enjoyable, the action keeps you on the edge of your seats. The whole film has a fast pace to it, but not overwhelmingly so.But the best part of the Mummy is the characters. They're a lot of fun, and easily make up for any flaws in electronic gimmickry. Brendan Fraser as the hero, Rachel Weisz as Evie, & John Hannah as Jonathan are a perfect trio, they bring a great deal of humor and just the perfect amount of campiness for a movie of this type. They, and the supporting cast as well (including the American tomb raiders, Kevin O'Connor as the sleazy desert guide Beni, and especially Omid Djalili as the Warden, are THE key reason to see this film.I love this film, and grab it off the DVD shelf every now and then when I'm just looking for some plain, old-fashioned entertainment.9 out of 10 Barky",The Mummy
176,jmillerdp,Great Escapist Filmmaking Returns!,8,20 May 2001,"With all of the empty-headed, boring action movies that are the norm these days, it's good to have a movie like ""The Mummy"" come along. Yes, it's goofy and tongue-in-cheek, but what the heck, it's a lot of fun and made by folks who clearly love movies. Stephen Sommers, who co-wrote and directed this film, is having a ball with this movie.Everyone's talked a lot about the visual effects, and oh yeah, the ILM kids have another field day with ""The Mummy."" ILM must have been a crazy place with both ""The Mummy"" and ""Star Wars: Episode I"" coming out at the same time. The creature itself is a marvel, wonderfully creepy and expressive. What I also loved were the cool backgrounds that lend the film a great sense of place, making the audience feel that they're right in Egypt during the time of the Pharaohs and of the 1920's. Thank gosh for computers, cause man, they're making all kinds of cool effects possible.The acting is very good, and fitting for this kind of movie. Brendan Fraser is very energetic, sometimes hamming it up too much, but certainly having fun. Stephen Sommers gives ""The Mummy"" a big dose of fun and energy, knowing when to go for laughs and when to go for thrills. Sommers does a great job of bringing back the epic adventure film, and buddy, it's been a long time!
I, as always, have a lot of admiration for the other artists who make movies. I loved the great score by Jerry Goldsmith (""The Omen,"" many of the ""Star Trek"" films). He composed many themes, showcasing the beauty of Egypt, the evil of the Mummy, or the adventure of our heroes. Both Goldsmith and John Williams are close to 70, and both of these veterans clearly get a kick out of these adventure films and really let loose with some great music. They make film composers half their ages seem asleep by comparison! Adrian Biddle (""Aliens"") knows how to shoot a genre film like ""The Mummy,"" and shows that he knows his stuff when it comes to photographing the gorgeous desert vistas as well.All in all, a ton of fun for someone like me who was weaned on ""Star Wars"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and has been getting kind of cynical about how fun has been disappearing from today's movies. Let's hope Stephen Sommers and others like him keep going and keep making movies that put our faith back in escapist filmmaking.(9 out of 10 Stars)",The Mummy
177,Jdc102,"Could have been better, but it wasn't a total waste of time",4,11 August 1999,"The Mummy, had some exciting parts, and some other funny moments, but to be honest I was a little disappointed because it took way too long for this film to get going, I don't think I wasted my time or money on this film but I expected more.  Brendan Fraser is very good in this, don't get me wrong because I think he was right for the role.",The Mummy
178,quinnox-1,"A great mix of comedy, adventure and horror",9,8 March 2010,"I just got around to seeing this movie and was surprised at how good it was. It kind of reminds me of Indiana Jones, but has a unique feel all its own. Brendan Fraser is really good in it, I don't think I have seen a movie of his before and he was perfect in this role as a droll man of action. My favorite aspect is how the director deliberately plays the movie for laughs and is winking at the audience with some of the lines. Like when Brendan Fraser says in reply to what should they do next - ""We have to rescue the damsel in distress and save the world"". I loved that. This movie is just plain fun and actually has some really funny moments as well.""The Mummy"" doesn't take itself seriously and knows that its just an entertaining comedy adventure and plays to this with no pretensions. The horror parts are all in good fun and aren't meant to be scary, this is a perfect film for families. An old fashioned movie that knows what it is and delivers on what it promises. I rate this highly because movies like this seem rare for some reason and I wish directors of today would take a look at this movie and make some more in this style.",The Mummy
179,cofemug,Decent waste of 2.5 hours,7,13 May 1999,"I have to recommend this movie because I enjoyed myself, even though this movie has nothing of any value to it.  It seems like a send-up of an Indiana Jones movie, and, although the only Indy movie I liked was ""Temple of Doom,"" which this movie is more like than the others, I liked this one.  It has creepy crawlys, weird, strange fx, nonsense, implausibility, and everything else.  I found myself enjoying it, even though it did not click with me. I like adventure movies with gadgets, 007 has Q, Inspector Gadget, etc. But, I must recommend this movie, and see it on the big screen, the FX are worth it, and would look dinky on anything but.---------7",The Mummy

As an adult who still does have fun watching the occasional James Bond movie, I think the Mummy is too much of everything: Too many too simple cliches, too many too one-dimensional characters and too many too foreseeable slapstick gags. Indiana Jones is still in a league of its own, and the Mummy may have been a huge surprise success in theaters, but will be forgotten very quickly.",The Mummy

182,Hussain-AL-Naseer,The Mummy & The Mummy Returns,8,14 May 2020,"The Mummy and The Mummy Returns both are my all time favorite movies as the Cinematic experience I got with both the movies on single screen theater is just I can not forget. Both films are the visual gems and has the capability to give you a great visual experience of ancient Egypt.
Action sequences, storytelling, Cinematography, Art, Costumes , Sets and CGI effects are some of the aspects to look for.
Both the films are blended with Humor, Emotions and some thrilling moments which may bring you to the edges. Director Stephen Sommers has effortlessly done his job to keep the audience intact with his crisp direction. The Screenplay articulated well especially in the second installment as story unfolds and connects with its first installment .Never forgetting the performances which also contributed equally to make this franchise worth watching. Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connel is surely the Heart and Soul of the movie, the Hero larger then life Macho, Blunt and Brave Fraser has nailed it, he was also exceptional as a caring Father and a lovable Husband in the second installment, Rick O'Connel is the best character Bredan has ever played supported toe to toe by Rachel Weisz as Evelyn Carnahan, Arnold Vasloo as Imotep has done good job as most of his role was behind CGI but he is the proper villain we got in the movie, Patricia Velásquez, John Hannah & Oded Fehr all justified their presence and supported well to the leads.
What ruined this franchise was its third installment even Jet Li as main Antagonist couldn't save it. Rachel Weisz & director Stephen Sommers absence felt greatly and Alex as grown up is something that I didn't buy as the little Alex in second installment was Brave kid just like his father which was all lost in third installment.""",The Mummy
183,Fudge-3,Great Saturday morning cinema.,9,29 June 1999,"There is a new Indiana Jones and his name is Mr O'Connell. The Mummy is an action/adventure/comedy in the best tradition of Saturday morning cinema and it does not miss a trick. A dash of horror/suspense will not have you white nuckled to your seat unless you found the episode in First Contact scary where Picard was chasing Borg through the darkened decks of his ship. This is strictly; tongue in cheek, rip roaring high adventure.Eventually we will become blase about all these special effects especially if they continue to be thrown at us with the abandon present in this movie. I expected that I had seen most of the FX in the trailer but there were lots more. I expected to see perhaps a dozen undead monsters that were computer (re)generated but there were scores of them and all beautifully realised. I didn't expect to see our hero in a melee with those recently reanimated, wrong again. It's all very clever, I love it and I wonder how long it will be before a whole movie is created in the computer with the actors cut in from simple (and cheap) green room set filming.Another thought occurs to me: are all the studios protecting themselves against the new Star Wars film? ""If Lucas is going to have lots of FX then we ought to too. Let's make our own FX filled movie so we don't get left behind."" So we are treated to Matrix one week and Mummy the next soon to be followed by Wild Wild West before The Phantom Menace has a chance to blow our socks off with its own computer wizardry.Regardless of the motive for making this film it is a cracking way to spend a couple of hours in the dark.

The special effects, the 10 plagues that follow when Imhotep comes back to life, different other characters, a comic relief, more action, and a body count. It lacks what the original one was, it was too in your face, and tongue in cheek. But Despite all those, the changes made it better and attracted quite an audience I must say. And I like the brother Jonathan who is a greedy man and a coward, and the other guy who is like him, Beni, who is also greedy and a coward, it made me want to watch this even more.

My problem with it is that it went more for camp than horror; this is not a very scary film. We marvel at the effects and ""look"" of The Mummy, but scared or horrified I was not. See Christopher Lee's The Mummy from 1959 for fright. Also, Brendan Frazier I am not a fan of. He has no subtlety or nuance whatsoever and is like a living cartoon. And that adds to the lack of real terror. I do wish there was more on ancient Egypt; the first scenes dealt with the betryal of Pharoah by his high priest Imhotep - and the art direction and ""look"", as said, were marvelous.

The actors all look great, and they are at the peak of their careers.It's classic Hollywood in every frame, perhaps it's the reason why it looked old fashioned, even when it came out at the end of the 90s.

Very fun action pieces

Great production value, tombs and props were spot on

Characters are all horribly cliche, female lead especially is a useless damsel in every action scene
Feels like you know exactly who's going to die
Lacks a consistent internal logic, no rulesBest part: boat on fire scene, fun shootout, clear shot, fun setpiece, overall effective action and cool to watch
Worst part: the female princess mummy dying to spears and swords, not too fair to make the guy mummy invincible and make her very frail, but whatever",The Mummy

I think it would have been muc better if it included more gore, throw in some blood and guts give it a higher rating. but it was more a family movie which was okay, great special effects, and some above average acting. Reading another review I found out some interesting facts which are very true which shows this movie is very similar to the evil dead moive, first off Rick O' Connell, played by Brendan Fraser, was kind of like Ash from 'Evil Dead', a square-jawed hero who was there just to do the dirty work while the smarter characters solved all the puzzles. A shoot first, think later kind of guy. There was even a Book of the Dead in the film, as there is in 'Evil Dead', which when decrypted has the power to bring the dead back to life, again just like 'Evil Dead'. The mummified priests in this film took the place of the zombie's in 'Evil Dead', having been brought back to life their only goal was to destroy Rick and his friends. Should have had the gore of Evil Dead. All up an entertaining watch, it'll keep your attention throughout.",The Mummy
195,maxmages,Looks to me like you're on the wrong side of the MOVIE!,6,17 April 2018,"It was one of the first films I saw in Germany. I have seen this movie about 3 times as a kid but loved it every time.Now that I'm an adult and have a clue, I see what a pretty Lama movie is not that bad or anything. It's just a big budget movie the special effects are better in an animated movie comma many 90s troops are present in there but unfortunately not the most intelligent, the forces as well as the laws of nature in this movie are so inconsistent and the casting is not really fitting point so none of that Actors are bad, they make an effort and so on, but I do not know what's missing there.Since the film is sometimes really cheesy a cheesy actor like Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Lundgren might be better suited or a dirty actor like Bruce Campbell, Kurt Russell, or Gerard Butler.
I would honestly leave the rest like that because then it would be balanced or overtake the cast and change only a few characters otherwise I like how ironic the movie is because there are a few things that are obviously only in there because they should look cool and in the movie That's at least addressed anyway, I have a problem with humor.
The beginning of the movie is like chewing gum the jokes are absolutely not funny the character of Evelyn's brother is absolutely superfluous and so not entertaining that he just annoyed and the middle of the movie is a bit repetitive.Making a good movie is difficult to make a remake, so taking a movie with a great concept and just packing it into another genre is a very smart idea and I would say they did that partially, you can not do it cheap Variant of Indiana Jones designate it looks more like a movie version of ""Relic Hunters"".
However, I have always wondered why Tab always had such a stupid curse that made him transfer money, but what do I know? I've always wondered why the Arabs can not be our main characters because they're pretty entertaining, but what do I know?All in all found. I thought the movie is alright not good not bad but quite enjoyable there are some things I liked it there are a few things I do not understand but I have not taken the urge to answer these questions.",The Mummy

While the plot is a bore, the visual tapestry unfolding before you will be worth your while. It wasn't as good as Congo (which is by no means a great movie) but was better than the Matrix.  My big problem with the film is Hollywood's penchant for demeaning people of Arab and Middle Eastern descent.

Everything in this movie is fun and the acting from Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, John Hannah, and Arnold Vosloo are nothing short of extraordinary! Okay, I might have exaggerated a bit but still The Mummy is my favorite film of all time.After awakening a mummy (Arnold Vosloo) back from the dead, two strangers (Rick O'connell and Evelyn Carnahan) have to undone their mistake and stop the mummy from gaining power and killing humans.Now, people are saying this is like Indiana Jones and trust me that it isn't like Indiana Jones at all but instead it is replaced with something better than what Indiana Jones could have ever done! Note: This film is my most watched film of all time. I think I have watched this like 21 times and counting.Final thoughts: The fun in this movie is excruciating and thats quite a good thing. I really loved The Mummy returns and i consider that the best sequel after Terminator 2: Judgment Day",The Mummy

201,fearfulofspiders,"Fun Adventure, Despite Some Flaws...",8,24 September 2008,"While not nearly as engaging as Raiders of the Lost Ark, or funny as The Last Crusade, The Mummy (1999) is a nice filler for those waiting for any more Indiana Jones films, or something like it.From beginning to end, The Mummy is very simple, and not one second of it is incomprehensible to a young audience member. The pacing is great; the buildup to the resurrection is actually a great success, and the adventures that ensue are horrifying, hilarious, and adventurous. Brendan Frasier gives a very nice performance as Rick O'Connell, and Rachael Weisz is just as good as Evey. For what he's given, Arnold Vosloo is very menacing as Imhotep, and Oded Fehr's character could have used more screen time to allow us to appreciate him more -- though plenty of that is in the second. The action flows, and is shot very well. The special effects are really good, and I don't think there has ever been a cooler-looking mummy. Jerry Goldsmith's score is decent enough to warrant a buy, though not nearly as sweeping as it could have been, it's still a decent collection of music.Overall, there's a lot of fun to he had from The Mummy. It sets out exactly doing what it intended, and never exceeds that or disappoints. I highly recommend it to fans of adventure films, Brendan Frasier, and those looking for a good time on a weekend night.",The Mummy

204,bjones,Fun adventure film,9,6 July 1999,"Here, the makers took the original stock horror film and turned it into an Indianajonesesque adventure in the tradition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The most visually rich part of the film was the opening scenes set in ancient Egypt. I would love to see an entire film built around that. The sets and costumes were brilliant.Especially tantalizing is the strictly painted-on attire of Patricia Velazquez as Anck-Su-Namum; what a stunning visual; but it completely upstages her performance. I have heard people talking about it. Some have mistakenly guessed her top was a mesh costume of some sort; not true, it is entirely - and only - paint.But Velazquez isn't the only thing to turn heads in the film, Rachel Weisz is appropriately attractive, though not as startling; her character is as solid and believable as she is lovely.The newcomer, Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bey, set quite a few female hearts aflutter; in our party, at least. The internet was lit-up searching for more photos of this guy.At first, I didn't particularly care for Brendan Fraser as the primary character (he's too well kept and cutesy for a rugged guy-type for me), be he grows on you. He seems to be developing into a versatile actor who will be around for a long time. His work here is good too.The special effects were the real star of the film, and they were visually rewarding and complimented the story in the right way in the right places. How Arnold Vosloo dealt with those in his role as the mummy Imhotep should be acknowledged. He must have had to imagine quite a bit of what he was interacting with to pull it off, and he does so with great style and substance for this type of role. He was nothing short of excellent.In fact, most of the remaining characters were well chosen. Jonathan Hyde and Kevin J. O'Connor added to the film in important ways, too. Together, everyone painted an enjoyable film, delivering exactly what it promised; fun, action, and adventure.",The Mummy
205,alexpeychev,A Modern Classic!,10,18 January 2021,"This movie is meant to be a classic. It is so ingenious and good that makes you watch it over and over again!
This movie is great, the cast is so good, I never heard of any of them before this movie, except for Brendan Fraser who was in the super famous ""George of the Jungle"" movie. Anyways the performances are very convincing, Brendan Fraser is great as handsome hero, Rachel Weisz is great as Evy, a clumsy but very intelligent egyptologist, John Hannah delivers the humor in this movie as Jonathan, the good-for-nothing guy who only cares about money, I have to mention Oded Fehr too, he was pretty good as the mysterious and attractive Ardeth Bay, the leader of the Mejais who is in charge to put the mummy back in his grave, and how can I forget the Mummy himself, Arnold Vosloo, who was, without any doubt, the best one in this movie. His performance is so good as the evil and sexy high priest Imhotep, he doesn't make you hate him, he makes you feel sorry for him! That is what I call ""acting skills"".",The Mummy

Some of the CGI was excellent, but historical accuracy was atrocious.Was it acceptable on the big screen?

Nice Egyptian sets reminiscent of Star Gate (the movie), scary demise for the Egyptian priest....Ahhmm... what happened?This flick was merely a replica of Wild Wild West minus the  giant mechanical spider but using a dead guy covered in bandages instead! The creature looked very interesting C.G.I wise and there were a few O.K. computer-assisted animated scenes, but overall, the story line and acting was bland, bland, bland.This flick tried WAY too hard to be another Indiana Jones, but it tripped over and landed on its head instead! We get lots of comic-book style action, flat and un amusing comedy (again Wild Wild West), comic-book bad guys, and the silly (but visually appealing) woman prancing about like a chicken with its head cut off. The main characters were cliched, unimaginative and quite forgettable. The Egyptian mummy-turned-priest was boring. Why didn't he get portrayed in a more sinister manner? I mean, he starts off trying to bring his dead girlfriend back to life and suddenly he's destroying the world!!!CONCLUSION: Quite nice S.F.X but it needs a LOT more than that! Very entertaining if you completely ignore the plot line! But considerably better than Wild Wild West.",The Mummy

The fx is on pointe. It jumpstarted me from my seat then and when I see it replayed, it is still good laugh after many years.

212,thewillt08,"Good, but Not Great",10,5 April 2013,"Every time I go to my grandparent's house one of two movies is always on TV, The Godfather and The Mummy. Two very different movies but let's talk about The Mummy. An ancient, evil, mummy comes back to life to revive his dead girlfriend while terrorizing Brendan Fraser and Rachael Weisz, I'm OK with that. The Mummy is an entertaining experience and goes down as one of my favorite movies as a kid.In the beginning there is a prologue showing Prince Imhotep and Anck Su Namun and their forbidden love story in the ancient city Hamunaptra. It is really interesting and the visuals of ancient Egypt and the story really sucked me in. I love a good prologue and the opening scenes to this movie were strong. Characters were introduced well with their first impressions. Imhotep is a clever villain. O'Connell is the level headed, strong, leader. Jonathan is the witty idiot who provides comedic relief, and Evy is the beautiful genius. The characters are cliché but for the goal of the movie it works. The plot is basic, acting is OK, and the special effects/action scenes are above average. The Mummy, for 1999 was a good movie but it is easily forgotten.Brendan Frasier plays Rick O'Connell and this is the best performance of his career, and that really isn't saying much. He is the standard superhuman who can do anything. He is smart, strong, handsome, and everything somebody wants in a hero. He wasn't a mindless action star because this isn't an action movie, thank god, so he has character development and is way different from the beginning compared to the end. He has his one-liners, he has his witty comments and funny moments, and sometimes they work really well, and sometimes it's painful to watch. When he first sees the mummy he freaks, says something stupid, shoots it in the face, and runs. That didn't work whatsoever. It was a typical one-liner that makes the hand smack the forehead. Then there is a moment where he yells at another mummy and it is his battle cry. The mummies respond and the look on his face was great before he runs away. I loved it, I laughed and it worked. Halfway into the movie we leave the desert and move to Cairo. This is where I expected the movie to slow down and become really boring, but it didn't. I loved most scenes in Egypt with the bugs that eat people and the digging in then tombs. That is all interesting to me and I almost wanted to go back. In Cairo, the movie gets really good because Imhotep needs to regenerate and seeing him slowly become human again, and by human I mean having skin and not a decaying corpus, was really cool and scary. The visuals of the ½ man ½ mummy were really cool. I love the visual of a bug crawling across his face and it crawls into a hole in his cheek and Imhotep just bites down and eats the bug, brilliant. For the entire movie I was waiting for when I would get taken out of the experience and would be turned off, and that was the plane scene with Winston. He was a pointless character with a meaningless plot point. I know why he was in the movie and it does make sense but I just hate it. The whole scene with the giant sandstorm was just so stupid. I watched it just loathing it and wanting it to end as soon as possible. Then it just ends in the worst way possible. I won't spoil but if this scene was cut out the movie would have been no different. For my favorite character it is a split between Beni and Jonathan. Beni is the weasel who works with the devil to save his own life. He even admits it. ""It is better to be at the right hand of the devil then in his path."" Every time I saw him I was waiting for somebody to kill him. There is no way he can possibly live and I was waiting for the bullet to the head, or the sword in the stomach, or even the mummy tearing him to shreds. Needless to say his character is very entertaining; we feel emotion towards him and is the wildcard in the movie. Jonathan is just straight up funny. He is dumb but had flashes of brilliance. He is kind of a sidekick but I enjoy seeing him on screen and his charisma adds a nice charm to the movie. This isn't a good movie without Jonathan or Beni in it.Overall, The Mummy is a good movie. It isn't a classic, but it isn't awful either. I liked the movie and every time it's on I will watch it. I can hop in at any point and have fun watching it. There is really nothing special about it, positive or negative. The CGI and special effects weren't groundbreaking. The acting won't win any awards, it's just a fun movie to watch and enjoy it for what it is. As for a grade, it's tough. It isn't good enough for an Honorable Mention, but isn't bad enough for an A For Effort. It is somewhere in the middle. I know, The Mummy gets the WillyT Recommendation. I recommend this movie to anybody who wants a decent movie to watch with friends and enjoy the story and action. Don't expect the best movie ever but don't expect garbage either. Just expect The Mummy.",The Mummy

215,GuyCC,"I loved this movie, but I have no idea why.",7,11 June 1999,"Before I give my comments on this movie, let me set the record straight on one thing. This movie is silly, far fetched, the special effects can be seen as just being that: special effects. For that matter, the plot isn't that entirely deep or perfect by any means. But I had a great time watching it. What I enjoyed the most about this movie are the one-liners. They were clever, well-timed, and quite a few of them had me laughing loudly in the theater. The acting was over-the-top, and had more of a comic book feel with its wise-cracking, overly ""dashing"" hero, the damsel in continual distress and the weasly henchmen working to suit his best interests. This movie was filled with those kind of ""adventure movie"" stereotypes, and instead of being disgusted by these cliches, I found that it made this movie all that more fun. Anyone going to see this film thinking that this movie is going to be serious or scary is going to be sorely disappointed. (That doesn't mean that little kids should see this movie. It's mildly gory in an ""Army of Darkness"" sort of way.) However, people wanting to be amused by a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously will find the two hours enjoyable. I can't wait to see this on DVD.",The Mummy
216,christophershobris,An Underrated Classic,9,11 September 2015,"When this film was released in 1999 people were skeptical in how this film was going to perform, especially when going up against Star Wars Episode 1. However to everyone's surprise it became a so called ""surprise hit"" that took theaters by storm or curses. In my opinion this is undeniably the most fun I've ever had in a film. This is because I knew it wasn't meant to be taken seriously like Indiana Jones with that said it is a blast that also throws you curves I didn't expect. It kept me guessing and intrigued. A film that does it's job very well with a mixture of horror and comedy and a sense of adventure that feels very Indiana Jones-ish. And the acting isn't too bad either but the best performances were from Rachel Weisz as Evelyn and Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni. This is a film you must see if you haven't already that's if you don't take it seriously, just sit back, relax and let your mouth be filled with popcorn and your eyes and mind as ease.

Once Imhotep awakes, he wreaks havoc on everybody, bringing curses and plagues with him. I must say, this was a really fun movie. It's surprising to me that it has a 6.whatever rating on IMDb. I think it's a lot better than that. It's funny, it has great characters, it's exciting, it's intense, and it's a thrill ride. I mean, it feels like you're on a theme park ride.

220,andrewmerritt-31652,A punk rock version of the 1932 movie of the same name,6,8 January 2020,"The Mummy stars Brendan Fraser, and Rachel Weisz. The film is set in 1925 and involves a group of archeologists who are hunting for the lost ancient city of Hamunaptra. However the group accidently awakens an ancient mummy who begins wreaking havoc in order to find his long lost girlfriend. This movie is loosely adapted from the 1932 movie and it has nothing to do with the Mummy starring Tom Cruise. I'm not going to talk about the Mummy with Tom Cruise because that's another review for another day. But this version of the Mummy will always be better than previous one we got, but I never saw the original let alone heard of it so I can't really compare the two. But this Mummy feels like it was a passion project from director Stephen Sommers. And while the jokes feel like they were just made up on the spot or maybe it tries too hard to be Indiana Jones, it is entertaining. Before the Uncharted games were released this is what Uncharted would've looked liked. And somewhere deep in my brain led me to believe that Stephen Sommers directed his own Uncharted movie which he made a sequel later. And a couple of years later someone from Naughty Dog watched the Mummy and decided to the movie into a video game franchise. And Brendan Fraser was also the inspiration of Nathan Drake, who brings humor to the movie. And occasionally it feels like he's trying way too hard to be romantic or portray Indiana Jones, you can't hate on the person. This movie came out in 1999, and for a time the special effects team did an amazing job creating the Mummy and all the other special effects involved. But when you watch it now, it feels outdated compared to the special effects we have today, but its still entertaining no matter how awful you think it seems. So in the end, The Mummy is a solid adventure movie that lacks humor and romance, but it makes up for its special effects that I would like to think would make Boris Karloff proud.",The Mummy

Sure, there are lots of great visuals here, the primary glory of the film being the CGI mummy, but ultimately this movie seems to fall into the same trap as Godzilla did: damn the script, full-throttle the effects.There are no real thrills here, either: most of the action sequences are cliched, uninspired, and just plain mindless.  There could have been tons of ways to make ""The Mummy"" at the very least be heralded at least as a kinetic thrill-ride, but you sure won't find any intensity here.Overall, ""The Mummy"" is pure silliness that will no doubt have kids entranced and yourself in a trance and becoming like a mummy; that is, getting a lot of shut-eye.4 out of 10",The Mummy

Like Rick O'Connel (Brendan Fraser) said, ""Rescue the damsel in destress, kill the bad guy, save the world.""  I don't want to reveal the plot, but really, that's how it is.  I think this movie was more like a comedy mixed with action: Jonathan (John Hannah) was pretty stupid, but funny, and also, Fraser's character had some pretty good one-liners. But,  as awesome as the movie is, I also recommend reading the novelization to the movie.  It has some more detail to it, and some additions that were not in the movie.  I recommend this movie to everyone!  Go see it.",The Mummy
228,nlytnd_1,"One of the worst, if not the worst movies I've ever seen",1,20 March 2013,"I guess I'll keep it brief. For one, I barely even remember it at this point, as I've blocked out much of this traumatic experience. I saw this in the theater at the time of it's release.The style of dialogue was so horrendous, which I detected 5 minutes into the movie. Similar to a cartoon or a comic book. Very slapstick and not funny at all (it's probably fair to say that it's unanimously not funny). It's the worst of all worlds. It doesn't take the serious route, moderately serious route, or even a route that's capable of producing at least 1 chuckle, rather a route of a complete garbage. Why would you even take a slap stick cartoon route with such a gargantuan movie budget? Well, I guess they got the last laugh, because this movie somehow made a fortune. Obviously, that's all they were going for, which is understandable and fine, but I would imagine most directors would want to make something they were proud of as well... not Stephen Sommers and his ridiculously bad filmography proves it. A complete Schlock director. This movie may as well have taken the special effects and flushed it down the toilet. It's the equivalent of writing am energetic comedy act and giving it to Ben Stein to perform. Of course that would have some potential to have reverse laughter. Unlike other movies that rank as the worst of all time (The Room, Troll 2, The Wicker Man etc), which are funny and worth watching because they are so bad, The Mummy is a 100% painful viewing experience. So, the Mummy is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen and I've consistently held that position ever since watching this piece of garbage. Perhaps this is a good movie for kids 10 and younger, but it's probably an insult to even their intelligence. It's difficult to harp on actors for being crappy under such bad direction and horrendous dialogue, but with that aside they are ridiculously bad. I'm a fan of John Hannah by the way and he doesn't stand out as being good or bad from what I remember... but the bad guy, the chick, Brendan Fraser and everyone else, words can't describe it. I particularly remember how stupid their facial expressions were.Here is my only spoiler and it wins the award for dumbest scene in the movie, from what little I remember of it. Basically, the bad guy conjures up a tornado and is chasing Fraser (and perhaps others) through the desert with it. As the tornado's about to take him out, the chick standing next to the bad guy (with a really lame facial expression, which she notoriously does throughout the movie) kisses him on the check. This distraction causes the tornado to dissolve and causes the bad guy to get an extremely lame facial expression as well (I can't even describe the facial expressions, because I've never seen anything like it before in my life). So essentially, this quick witted act saved Fraser from certain death. Anywho, it's stupid crap like this that causes this movie to kill brain cells. If you're going to kill brain cells I recommend smoking crack instead of watching this piece of crap, at least you'll get some pleasure in return.",The Mummy
229,hhfarm-1,Some clever bits but really bad overall,4,1 March 2006,"I always wondered why the library would have several copies on Friday evening. Yes, it's pretty bad: disjointed plot, hammy acting, over-the-top character bonding in every movie category: male-male, male-female, badguy-henchman, monster-heroine, heroes-camels.This should probably be a 2 but there are a couple of decent effects and there's some good acting. John Hannah & Rachel Weisz are good. Hannah is awesome actually, one of the highlights of the film. Brendan Fraser tries way to hard to be Indiana Jones. The beetles do a nice job - some of the same effects as Lion King.If you have nothing better to do and you have the fast-forward button handy, it's worth a go.",The Mummy
230,nmholland,"Cheesy Indiana Jones Rip Off, Yet Good",7,27 January 2016,"The Mummy was directed by Stephen Sommers and stars Brendan Fraser as an adventurous hero who can carry a lot of guns. The Mummy, just like every other movie in existence, has its good qualities and its bad qualities. Its good qualities include a good plot, and good special effects. Its bad qualities include a bad plot, and bad special effects.What I mean by the above paragraph is that half of the plot, and half of the special effects, are good. The other half suck. To get started, I'll give a brief synopsis: We start out in ancient Egypt and the Pharoah at the time was a jealous guy. He literally didn't let anybody touch his wife. However, his high priest, a man named Imhotep, and his wife were in the middle of a passionate affair, and are busted by the Pharaoh. The Pharaoh sees the body paint on his wife's arm is smeared, implying that another person has touched her. He is then surprised to see it is Imhotep. He is then murdered by Imhotep and his wife, who then proceeds to kill herself, simply because we need a plot.Imhotep then runs away, but returns to try to resurrect his long lost love. However, in the middle of the ceremony, he is interrupted by the Pharaoh's guards, and sentenced to the worst torture possible, in which the victim's tongue is cut off, and is mummified alive and put into a sarcophagus with flesh-eating bugs, so that he will suffer for a long period of time. Then, it skips forward to 1923 and our hero, Rick O'Connell, is in the middle of a war for the land in which Imhotep is buried. He is abandoned by his friend, Beni, and is almost killed. He escapes, but is later found in prison 3 years later. A woman, named Evy Camahan, and her brother, Jonathan, bail Rick out, and go on an adventure to uncover treasure near Imhotep's burial site. They later find and open his sarcophagus and release him on accident. They now must find a way to stop his plan to resurrect his lover and defeat him in order so save the world.The Mummy is very reliant on its special effects. This film was released in 1999, a time when they did not have as good of effects as nowadays. However, most of the CGI in the movie was not only believable, but rather good. For instance, all of the scenes containing Imhotep, prior to his state of full-regeneration, look very real, with pieces of his flesh missing about his body. Also, in scenes where a flesh-eating bug is crawling inside of someone's skin, it looks very real. Despite all of the good effects in this film, some of them are either non-believable, or just plain bad. An example of this would be far-off shots of cities look like a cheap model bought at the local Dollar General of a set from Raiders of the Lost Ark.Another issue would be the plot. Some of the plot makes perfect sense, and really advances the movie, but other pieces feel like they're just there so that there can be a plot. For example, in the middle of the movie, the team figures out that Imhotep wants Evy so that he can use her as his human sacrifice in order to resurrect his ancient girlfriend. Now, why would he choose her? To me, it felt like he chose her just to give Rick a chance to rescue the damsel in distress. Another good example would be how the Mummy must kill all of the men who opened the box that contained the book of death. When he tries to claim his first victim, he is interrupted, and only gets his hands on the man's tongue and eyeballs. This makes no sense; that he had to take his time in order to get the guy's full body. When he kills the other three men, the process happens instantly. But apparently, this first guy was special, because he had to take his sweet time with him.Despite the dents in the plot, there are well written parts that really help out the movie. One of these parts would be in the middle of the movie, when the treasure hunters are attacked by a group of men guarding the tomb. Rick is about to get killed by one of these men, but lights the fuse of a dynamite stick, which seems like a really stupid idea at the time. However, if any of you listen to the audio commentary, the director explains that this was put in the movie so that the group could see that Rick wasn't at the site just for treasure, he was willing to risk his life, and those around him, for the knowledge of the history contained in the city.So, through watching it twice, and once with the commentary, overall, I liked The Mummy. It had a decent plot, likable characters, and halfway good CGI. After consideration, I'd give this film a B-, or a 7 out of 10.",The Mummy
231,teejayniles2345,Take a Horror archetype and add all the new tricks,10,30 April 2001,"This 1999 ""remake"" was a winning summer blockbuster due to its appealing non-stop plot and special effects.  Although its timeline seems a bit confused (was it 3000 years ago or 3000 BC?), this Hollywood formula flick takes elements from successful films of the 80's and 90's and goes full tilt with them.  The idea of taking and updating a Horror Film archetype has diverged in multiple directions with the Vampire/Dracula but the Mummy as fearsome archetype of the undead was never quite on such a level of the imaginative for studio projects.  The popularity of ""Indiana Jones"" however explains a lot of what this movie was also reviving for mainstream audiences.  The plot here however is designed for elementary school level archaeologists who like to pilfer each other's unsystematically gathered artifacts.  The fatal ""scarabs"" also owe a lot to the ""Alien"" who gets ""under the skin"" rather literally.  The heroine is quite differently a pawn of the hypnotic Imhotep; this script goes far afield from the reincarnation themes of the classic ""Mummy"" film of the 1930's.  Evelyn/""Evie"" seems to be a ""liberated"" librarian who also triggers the magical rejuvenation of the cadaver-mummy who's still rather ""gross"" just out of his sarcophagus-prison. Imhotep has an Achilles heel that is novel and interesting but the scope of his substantial powers evoke the Ark and Old Testament themes of the first Indiana Jones movie that Spielberg and Lucas collaborated on.  The makeup seems to move us away from the entombment sequence of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and toward the horrific extremes of decay and skin metamorphisizing. The lost city seems rather easily found by outsiders for having been lost with its precious treasures that are quite as unimportant as in Disney's film ""Aladdin.""  The film has some fun humor lines thrown by a minor character who's quite able to steal scenes of all sorts.  Whenever I see that character on screen, however, I remember him from the 80's winner: ""Four Weddings and A Funeral.""  All in all, THE MUMMY (1999) is a wild ride with a happy ending for a ""triangle"" that's about as unconventional as might be, given the original movie's premise about the ancient lovers' plight. Watch it with a full box of popcorn and look away if necessary (which is really quite at a minimum)!",The Mummy
232,jiangliqings,Dazzlingly fun action/adventure film clicks on all cylinders.,10,19 May 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *** 1/2 out of ****The recent box office success of The Mummy Returns has given me cause to re-examine its predecessor.  Most of the critical response to the sequel has been mixed, with the majority of the critics stating it's weak when compared to the original.  Movie audiences have been far kinder, many stating it's better than the original and some saying it's even better than Raiders of the Lost Ark!  Naturally, I took the time to look back at The Mummy, the film that opened the summer of 1999.The film was by no means the most anticipated blockbuster of the summer. That honor belonged to more hyped up films like Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and the Austin Powers sequel, but the box office numbers for The Mummy shocked everyone.  I saw the movie for myself and found myself agreeing with many critics and viewers, the film is by far the most fun I've had in a movie theater in nearly ten years, since I last saw Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.  The Mummy is a rollicking thrill ride, a blend of action/adventure/humor with a nice dash of romance that keeps things moving along at a lightning pace.  Best of all, the characters were memorable and the action sequences were thrilling and exciting.The plot isn't anything that's Oscar worthy, but it does set up a fun premise.  In the times of Ancient Egypt, a priest named Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) was having an affair with the Pharaoh's wife, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velazquez).  The Pharaoh discovers this matter of infidelity, which forces Imhotep and his lover to kill him.  As punishment, the Pharaoh's guards execute Anck Su Namun, and in despair, Imhotep takes her lifeless body to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, in hopes of restoring her spirit to her body.  In the middle of the process, the Pharaoh's guards interfere, the ritual is left unfinished, and Imhotep and all his priests are killed and mummified.  Imhotep's body, in particular, must be guarded at all times, for an ancient curse has been placed on it and if he is awakened, he could bring the end of the world.The story cuts to the 1920's, with a lovely but ditzy librarian named Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) intrigued by her brother Jonathan's (John Hannah) latest discovery, a key with a map that could lead to Hamunaptra. Unfortunately, the map is burned so they must rely on the man who had been in possession of the key, a former legionaire named Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser).He leads the small group into the desert, with a rivalling team led by a former acquaintance of O'Connell's named Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), who is leading  a group of Americans.  They reach the lost city at the same time, and while O'Connell's team discovers the mummified body of Imhotep, the Americans retrieve the mysterious Book of the Dead.Evelyn, who is developing romantic feelings towards O'Connell, is interested in the other group's discovery.  She steals the Book of the Dead from them and reads several passages aloud, with horrifying results.  Imhotep is awakened and is on a quest to gain power and revive his lost love, Anck Su Namun.  To accomplish this, he must first kill the men who found the book and sacrifice Evelyn.  It is now up to O'Connell, Jonathan, and a mysterious cult leader named Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) to stop the mummy before his reign of terror spreads over the world.The film's director and writer, Stephen Sommers, must be really well-versed in adventure films.  He knows how to bring out the boyhood sense of fun in nearly every scene, and he never fails to do anything less than make this a rousing thrill ride.  He never does anything particularlyl innovative, but his ability to breathe life into the adventure genre again is refreshing. His emphasis on characters and humor make this a more satisfying experience than most other summer blockbusters.  It's nice to see a movie that has true intentions of entertaining the audience, and not just try to make a quick buck.The action sequences are a partial reason for the movie's success. Sommers tries out something different for every action scene.  There are gunfights, swordfights, tense chase scenes, and a breathtaking sandstorm.  But Sommers wisely doesn't exhaust you with non-stop action.  The real non-stop thrills don't begin until the 1-hour mark.  He does a nice job of building the momentum with adventure, humor, and romance.Speaking of the romance, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have an undeniable amount of sizzling chemistry.  They work well together and it would be nice to see them in a film outside of this genre.  Fraser is the perfect choice for the ruggedly handsome hero.  He does a great job for the physical parts and his charisma is just as strong as his acting.  Weisz does end up mostly playing the damsel in distress, but there's great fun in that acknowledgement and she plays her part quite well.  Plus, the fact that she's very cute doesn't hurt matters.  John Hannah as the comic relief is quite hilarious.  Some of the jokes he's given aren't necessarily funny but his delivery is so dead-on, I couldn't help but laugh.
The lead trio have the most presence.  The actors playing the villains don't really have much dialogue.  Arnold Vosloo is a menacing physical presence and though he doesn't say much he does ooze with a certain sense of icky creepiness (could be due to those mummy effects).  Patricia Velazquez doesn't do much other wear some skimpy clothing.  As a mummy, she basically shrieks her way through the role.  Once again, it's not as if though these villains really need to be well-defined.Sommers' script isn't anything brilliant by a long shot, but it's a very entertaining and well-spun tale, which is better than what can be said for most big-budget summer films.  The dialogue, though sometimes seemingly corny, actually works perfectly and is often quite hilarious.  The humor, obviously intentional from all standpoints, keeps the movie's pacing tight and adds an extra degree of fun to the whole production.Sommers also injects the film with the right tone and mood.  It's hardly a frightening film, and that's certainly not the point.  He keeps things on a light-hearted, though still tense and thrilling, level.  The movie doesn't take itself very seriously, and as a result it's a movie experience that's all the better for it.  We've already had a horror-related film about a mummy, and it was time for something more cinematically rousing, which is definitely Sommers' intent.The special effects are quite outstanding.  The initial sight of the mummy is obviously far too CGI, but it works within the film's tone.  Having a seriously scary-looking monster would have ruined the slight tongue-in-cheek attitude the movie was going for.  The rest of the visuals are great.  The design of Hamunaptra is convincingly ancient and mystical.  The large wave of locusts and beetles are also a sight to behold, but the film's best effect is the sandstorm, which Sommers films from the perfect angles, giving us a sense of how immense in size and scope it is.The Mummy has obviously had the largest lasting impression of 1999's summer films.  It may not have the money of Phantom Menace or the innovative visuals of The Matrix, but it's a film that is superb because it succeeds in what it promises to do, and that's to thrill and entertain you for a couple of hours, and it has no pretensions about doing so.",The Mummy
233,EdRooney,Mummified Flick,1,8 May 1999,"""The Mummy"" Trust me, I'm not opposed to having fun with silly material.  I don't consider myself a dour person and I love a good ""bad"" movie.  My take on ""The Mummy"" is this : Expectations were high, and the filmmakers blew it. Set with a 80 million dollar budget and a distinctly stinky track record, how could I believe in my mind that director Stephen Sommers could pull this off?  The movie is a mess of really lame and desperate jokes, boisterous effects, and an unproved cast.  Brendan Fraser leads this journey with a pinch of Indiana Jones, a dash of Jerry Lewis, and a sprinkle of a Barry White baritone.  I don't like Mr. Fraiser, and his usual wooden performance doesn't suit the material. By trying to make him into the hero, the film succeeds in showing off even more of Mr. Fraser's limits. John Hannah makes for a passable lackey, and Rachel Weisz is delightful as the ""girl"" of the film(I was already a fan). The two actors who really ooze mediocrity are Kevin J. O'Conner as the sniveling bad guy, and Arnold Vosloo as the title character.  While being a computer creation for most of the piece, Mr. Vosloo has to take over at the end of the film.Trouble is, he's not scary at all.  He resembles more of an aging lawyer who just flew back from Jamaica than a mummified agent from hell. The effects, which took up 1/4 of the budget, are in turns both impressive and depressing.  Using the computer to enhance a sky or to make 5 people 500... That's fantastic.  Using the same technology to create a noisy environment where each effect looks worse than the next is where I draw the line (Trust me, Spielberg was on to something when he used REAL insects in ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom""). All the CG stuff looks incredibly false to me, my kingdom for a guy in a rubber suit! Sommers has no tricks up the sleeve except to continuously bombard the senses with noise and predictable humor.  It could have been fun, it should have been great, what's left is the biggest letdown from a Hollywood production in some time.---------- 2",The Mummy
234,beejer,Indiana Jones Meets the Mummy?,5,2 October 1999,"I was disappointed in this movie. I was expecting to see a remake of the 1932 (Karloff) and 1959 (Christopher Lee) versions, but instead got Indiana Jones Meets the Mummy. Director Sommers doesn't seem to know if he is making a horror, adventure or comedy film.The special effects to be sure, are state of the art, however, the producers seem to have been going for quantity rather than quality in effects. The mummy character is evil to be sure, but is way over the top. He just didn't scare me. The other ""liberated"" mummys are too plentiful and cartoon-like to be believable. The plague of insects looks ridiculous and obviously computer-generated.The hero, heroine and other assorted players don't seem to take the situation too seriously. With both guns a-blazing and a devil-may-care attitude, they look like refugees from the old Saturday matinee serials. And what was the point of the heroine knocking over library bookshelves in the context of the story. And the hero's escape from the gallows? The list goes on and on.Harrison Ford did the Indiana Jones thing much better. Karloff did the mummy character better in black & white and in 72 minutes in 1932. The Lee 1959 version was also superior and scarier.I want my mummy back.",The Mummy

It does a pretty good job at creating a campy, goofy adventure tale similar in some ways to Indiana Jones, but it's less serious and more lame. I found it somewhat fun to watch, but at the same time, it just barely stays out of the realm of complete boredom, venturing every once and a while to the very edge of that precipice without quite tumbling in. Thus, it basically does the job, but it's not really that funny, is usually too silly to be really fun, and is hardly the best Brendan Fraser movie.

The scene in the library where all the shelves fall like a stack of dominoes was priceless-amazing what trouble they go to just for a few minutes of nonsense. You had what might be called the serious entry into the story-the events of ancient Egypt where they buried people alive and went in for extreme punishments for stuff like adultery. I enjoyed watching the bugs thrown into the coffin where the adulterer had been wrapped up as a mummy and this is one of the cornerstones of horror-burying alive. The special effects were a case of no expense spared for a movie which was not ruined by foul language when there would have been cause for it with all that mayhem.

240,TimBoHannon,All hail Imhotep,8,5 June 2007,"For centuries, greedy adventurers and gold-seekers sought the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra. This hidden metropolis of myth and legend is the rumored resting place of the wealth of the pharaohs. What none of them know is that Hamunaptra is also the housing for the cursed Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo).More than 1,000 years before Christ, Imhotep is caught in an affair with the pharaoh's mistress, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velazquez). Even though Imhotep escapes, Anck Su Namun is not so fortunate. Determined to resurrect her, he and his priests violate her tomb in Hamunaptra but are apprehended before they can finish. In addition to being mummified alive, Imhotep is also condemned with the most terrible of ancient curses. The catch is that if he is ever released, he will become ""a plague upon mankind with power over the sand and the glory of invincibility."" A secret society maintains vigil over the ruined city in order to keep him sealed in his eternal prison.Fast forward to 1923 Cairo, where American Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), a former visitor to Hamunaptra, is to be hanged. Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah) discover his past and secure his life in exchange for his escort to the city. Carnahan is not interested in treasure, but instead wishes to unearth the book Aman-Ra. As an Egyptian-speaking librarian, she is drawn not by its solid gold cover, but its historical merit. There is a rival band of Americans guided by O'Connell's old comrade Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), the frontrunner for weasel of the decade. He carries amulet bearing every major religious symbol and possibly one or two he made up. When he runs into trouble, he holds each one in the air and utters a prayer in that language.The procession that arrives at Hamunaptra consists of nine named characters. The plot I described above all takes place in the first twenty minutes of film, but nearly an hour goes by before the mummy makes its appearance. The premise of the movie is all about rules and more rules, but the writers avoid audience confusion by taking painstaking care to establish them, as well as using repetition to solidify them in our minds. My second viewing revealed even more connections that I missed the first time. It is imperative that the viewer be educated in this film, and the writers' skill gives the Hamunaptra set an uncanny life. When Imhotep arrives, the viewer is prepared but not impatient.There is also a nice marriage of mood and function. O'Connell is the type of hero with eyes in the back of his head, and the movie correctly treats his action scenes with an appropriate level of absurdity. Director Stephen Sommers does a fine job achieving the right tone from the script, which he also wrote. The movie is not short on creative yet droll devices for the heroes to survive, including a moment of genius when Jonathan pretends to join a crowd chanting Imhotep's name. There is also a running gag on how far the mummy's jaw can open.The all-important special effects are exquisite and still look strikingly good eight years later. One particularly impressive effect is a face-bearing sandstorm that is chasing an airplane. The gunner relentlessly fires the mounted gun into the storm creating a snake of miniature sand explosions. Vosloo spends most of the film as some combination of Imhotep's sinewy skeleton and revived skin and flesh. The skeleton has a wide range of facial expressions and looks realistic when it moves. At one point a scarab crawls out of a hole in his neck and into his jaw, and he eats it. There is also the appearance of some of the Biblical plagues, although I think the biblical hailstorm was falling ice, not basketball sized meteorites. ""The Mummy"" is at its core an action movie, and ultimately lives or dies by it, so quality special effects are essential.The stunts are as well, and the delivery does not disappoint. Several of them are good enough wow even the most experienced action fan, especially during a scuffle with the crumbly stone soldiers.The cast was mainly comprised of accomplished stage actors. All fill their assignments well, Weisz in particular. Vosloo does not speak a single syllable in English, but still impresses. All elements come together to take a complex world of rules and make it bona fide entertainment, so ""The Mummy"" ranks as an eight out of ten.",The Mummy
241,Mike Astill,Spirited adventure yarn,8,13 January 2003,"Spirited adventure yarn, the (very) bare bones of which retells the classic Karloff movie from the thirties. Fraser plays square-jawed, two-fisted hero Rick O'Connell with affable good-humour and obvious enthusiasm.  Weisz plays prim librarian Evelyn Carnaham, who unwittingly releases Lord Imhotep from his eternal living death. The rest of the cast, not least Arnold Vosloo as the titular bad guy, are all equally great, not bad considering their roles are (necessarily) a collection of hackneyed stereotypes.Were people going to accept an archaeology-based pulp yarn, necessarily crammed with referential gags and slapstick action, without pointless comparisons to Indiana Jones? Well no, but to Sommers' credit he's made room for his own creation in the homage to the pulps' genre. The movie's topped off with a rousing homage to Harryhausen's seminal battle scene from Jason and the Argonauts, here with dusty CG mummies taking the place of stop-motion skeletons.

The exceptional visuals make it worth the price, however.",The Mummy
243,gentendo,I'm not a big fan of Mellow Dramas,3,1 October 2008,"Society seems to be drifting further away from buying into the classical mellow dramatic structure, whether in theater or film. Its structure is too predictable, exaggerated and mundane for an ever increasing and intelligent world that starves for realism, or at least parody. It shouldn't be a surprise, then, why films such as The Dark Knight or Enchanted are coming out and breaking those classical conventions in order to give audiences something newsomething fresh. We're moving away from the classical structure and progressing into the hybrid worlds of both morally ambiguous and farcical mellow dramas.Although The Mummy stayed fairly true to the mellow dramatic structure, there were certain parts that seemed to hint at more farcical interpretations. In other words, it seemed as though the filmmakers were comfortable in making fun of the film itself. For example, when eerie sounds of wind or moans would seep through an open window, Brendan Frasier's character would poke fun at how he expected things like that to happen: ""That seems to happen a lot around here,"" he says mockingly. By doing so, he confirms a predictable convention in mellow drama that audiences have been spoon fed for far too long. The result: people laugh and don't take the genre quite too seriously. Another progressive move away from the classical structure comes when Rachel Weisz' character foretells the demise of the unfaithful sidekick, Beni: ""People like you always get their come uping's,"" she says, as if to confirm the tragic outcome of all villains in mellow dramas. These two scenes (and I'm sure there were others) depict socially progressive movements away from the cliché elements of mellow drama, and do so by playfully mocking the overall style of the film.Culturally regressive elements in the film deal with how both women and Arabs are portrayed. If memory serves me correct, I believe Rachel Weisz is one of the only female characters in the entire film. She is depicted as being clumsy and inferior; one not on equal playing ground as the men. Her clumsiness is demonstrated in the beginning when she knocks over an entire library of books, and her inferiority is shown when smug comments are thrown her way by certain gold diggers: ""Don't worry; they have a woman on their side. They can't get too far."" She also fits the classical mold of the damsel in distress; one that is helpless by herself and needs a hero to save her. All of these ideas reflect an age unknown to the generation we, today, live in. That is, today women hold much higher statuses and are even, in some cases, more capable than men than displayed in this film. Arabs are portrayed in two lights. In one sense, they are depicted as being traitors to their friends, as shown when Beni betrays Frasier; and in another sense, however, they are shown to be heroes; such as the relationship between Frasier and the Magi, who, at first, seems to be obstacle for Frasier, but later becomes his protecting warrior. The portrayal of Arabs, then, is split down the middle; reflecting them as both socially progressive heroes and culturally regressive traitors.",The Mummy
244,keihan,The worst remake of all time (and that's saying something)...,1,18 February 2000,"My only problem with the critical loathing of the Mummy (1999) is that I am convinced that they did not dismember it enough. Therefore, I feel obligated to do such as is my duty as a movie lover. I really don't want to. But somebody's gotta, SO...here goes.One comment that has stuck with me that I heard in the audience the night I went to see this wretched piece of celluloid is someone saying ""This is like Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Which it IS--minus the good parts. One would think with a budget of $80 million that they could afford to a)hire some better actors or b) write a better script. The humor, more often than not, is limp, the characterization is non-existent, all that CGI-animated sand could not hope to begin to plug the frequent plot holes, and I'm convinced that they used Boris Karloff's actual corpse in the initial scenes of the mummy being unearthed to save some money.The film's main problem is that it cannot decide what it wants to be: action/adventure, comedy, or horror. So, by way of idiotic compromise, it tries being all three and, naturally, winds up failing miserably. The elements of the three genres mentioned above are not interchangable and I very much resent the filmmakers acting like they were. Then there's the business of the plagues of Egypt and the Book of the Dead. Excuse me, but the plagues are from Exodus, not Egyptian mythology, and, as anybody who watched the original 1932 classic upon which this is VERY loosely based, the Egyptians didn't use BOOKS. They used papyrus scrolls! And could somebody please explain to me why, if people have been looking for this city for their entire lives without finding it, it took our thoroughly brain-dead cast something like half a day to?Probably the worst crime that this film committed was the evisceration of the character of Imhotep. Karloff portrayed him as a love-lost monster, equal parts sympathetic and repellant. Here, he's not even a blip on the radar screen, character-wise. All we mostly see is this dessicated corpse who, for some non-sensical reason, is afraid of cats (must have watched ""Pet Semetary"" too many times), can turn himself in a living sandstorm (which I think makes for a nice metaphor for the filmmakers; both are full of hot air), and has the most idiotic on-screen death ever captured on film. Karloff must be spinning in his grave.Remakes, more often than not, are experiments in re-animation. While the occasional few do wind up being as good or better than the original, most such remakes are failures. Why? Because the ones doing the makeover don't understand what made the film work the first time...and don't care to. That, perhaps more than anything, is why I hate this version of the Mummy. Some things are better off dead.",The Mummy
245,flickjunkie-3,Deeply Flawed.,6,22 November 2000,"*Warning. There May Be Brief Spoilers.*My friend had recommended The Mummy to me, he told me it was an excellent flick. The Mummy is far from excellent. Even great or good is exaggerating. This film is a mess, it could of been a spectacular action flick if it wasn't let down by a disgustingly poor script and lots of acting flaws.The movie opens in Ancient Egypt, a voice over tells us the story of forbidden love between the scantily clad Pharaoh's wife and the high priest Imhotep. It is of course a story with a tragic end for the prohibited lovers as she is murdered and mummified and he is buried alive with an obscene amount of Scarab beetles to gnaw at his flesh. Cut to 1925 and O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and a group of legionnaires are fending off the remnants of the Ancient Pharaoh's Royal guards who have kept a pact over the centuries to keep Imhotep's tomb from being discovered. Confident that they have vanished all the intruders the guards retreat , unaware that Rick has inadvertently discovered their secret. Thus enuses copious amounts of adventure and Mummy gahs as our hero, now accompanied by Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), Jonathan (John Hannah) and a hoard of expendable extras resurrect the ancient evil and then run away and hide.The Mummy is sometimes an entertaining feature film, and it is a joy to watch Fraser try and do something a little less George-of-the-Jungle-ish, but, this is an extremely poor flick in the sense of how much quality and cleverness it provides.Prepare to be entertained during action sequences, but just take note, most audiences won't exactly be that spellbound  with The Mummy.I rate The Mummy 6 out of 10.",The Mummy
246,Siloty,great mummy movie,10,24 May 2008,"OK, hands down this movie is just awesome...Probably the best mummy movie.Brendan Fraser as the gung-ho Rick O'Connel is really funny and one of the characters that just makes this movie so great. John Hannah as Jonothan is good comic relief. one of my favourite seens with jonothan is when he is pretending to be one of the mindless followers of Imhotep.basically Rachel Weisz' character wakes up a mummy, Imhotep played by Arnold Vosloo (who i must say did quite a convincing job and i enjoyed his performance) and Imhotep sets plagues onto the land of Egypt and wants to resurrect his lost love.some people may find this movie has some scary parts in it, but its also a lighthearted movie in having comedy in it as well. you could say this is a horromedy.",The Mummy

He really made the movie as enjoyable as it was. The Mummy himself, at some points, scared me. And the bugs that go through people were really disgusting but it was also really cool. The movie was fantastic and I recommend it to all viewers who like adventure and action through out the whole movie.",The Mummy
248,paul-nemecek,The Mummy for Dummies,6,6 July 2018,"In Joseph Boggs' book The Art of Watching Films, Boggs suggests that we should consider the level of ambition of a film in evaluating that film. That is, we shouldn't criticize Sleepless in Seattle for not being Schindler's List. Sleepless in Seattle set out to be a sweet romantic comedy and achieved that goal quite nicely. Stephen Sommers' The Mummy appears to have been spawned with a fairly low level of ambition in mind. The good news(?) is that the director achieved his goal. About the only saving grace of this film is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.The Mummy is loosely based on the Boris Karloff classic from years gone by. Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'Connell, a soldier of fortune, who knows the way to a famous lost city in Egypt. Rachel Wiesz plays Evelyn, a librarian and would-be archaeologist who joins forces with O'Connell and a few other cliches to find the city and uncover hidden treasures. In trying to uncover the treasure they unleash a curse (guess who) and yotta yotta yotta . . .  One of the few bright spots in the film is John Hannah in a supporting role as Evelyn's brother. Hannah's previous films include Four Weddings and a Funeral and Sliding Doors. His part is more slapstick sidekick here but he carries it off quite nicely. There are some excellent special effects, but I am frankly more than a little weary of films that put special effects where the plot is supposed to be. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz do okay in their roles, but their roles are really not worth much effort.In the end, The Mummy looks like the offspring of a misbegotten marriage between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Ghostbusters. Unfortunately, it's not as funny as the latter, nor as exciting as the former, and ends up being a ""C minus"" grade B film. There are a few scenes that make it inadvisable for kids under thirteen. The rest of the scenes make the film inadvisable for anyone with an IQ greater than that of the average four year-old. Next time out writer-director Sommers would do well to set his sights just a little bit higher.",The Mummy

He did well in action, romance and even silly situations. All other actors did great as well but their performance was not remarkable as ""Brendan Frazer"".All scenes are catchy to the eye, the director showed a few shadows scenes which were great. If you watch it in 2018, you will not feel that it's old or outdated.All the make up and special effects scenes are perfectly done. You will see magnificent scenes of Ancient Egypt and its treasures.Finally, it's a great adventure movie that is not comparable to any other movie that represented the idea of Egypt's treasure hunting, it's funny, light and you will not feel bored here.",The Mummy

Nothing too special, but not a total waste of time and money.There are some good set pieces to be had, but the gimp who serves the Mummy just needs to be shot!!!!!I can't really be bothered to write much about this film, as I am biased AGAINST it!! The best thing for you to do is watch it yourselves and make up your own minds.I'll give it 8/10, but I still don't know why!!!

252,roystephen-81252,Still funny and entertaining after all these years,9,19 February 2016,"Well, times change. At the time The Mummy was a big hit in the theatres, many people going as far as claiming it was more entertaining and even having better special effects than the other big blockbuster that came out at approximately the same time, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I still find that claim ridiculous (yes, I enjoyed The Phantom Menace immensely and I refuse to be ashamed about that, what's more, I love it even more now). The effects in The Mummy were fine (if nothing special) then, but seem pretty outdated and amusingly B-level now. But it doesn't really matter. It's not the effects that make or break a movie. What I want to say is that audiences generally seemed to enjoy The Mummy in 1999, but since then, it seems people have forgotten how to watch a movie that is pure tongue-in-cheek fun (hence the relatively low rating on IMDb).It is not a real remake of the 1932 horror classic. It is an adventure movie, a kind of comedy version of Indiana Jones. And for that, it does work very well. Brendan Fraser is a surprisingly good fit for the swashbuckling character of Rick O'Connell (a career best, probably), as is Arnold Vosloo for Imhotep. The movie is funny, exciting, well-paced – in short, sheer mindless fun.I must admit, I dismissed The Mummy as a so-so popcorn movie back then, but I have seen it many times since, and it never fails to entertain. It has proved to be highly rewatchable, and that is always a sign of a good movie for me.",The Mummy

To me it was both thrilling (nothing scary about it, though) and funny (Kevin O'Connor was hilarious as Beni), which is a rare combination nowadays. Historically accurate or not, it's one way to possibly attract viewers to Egyptian mythology. I'll admit, one thing I enjoyed was seeing how one of the co-stars was going to get bumped next, as opposed to the tiresome bullet-in-the-brain routine. The script wasn't great, but it hardly matters. I particularly liked Rachel Weisz and John Hannah as her bumbling brother. I bought the video the day it came out and it was my favorite movie of the year until ""Sleepy Hollow"" was released (another great combination of comedy and thrills). Overall, ""The Mummy"" is definitely worth checking out. If you haven't seen it yet, rent or buy a copy today.",The Mummy
255,King_Opossum,Great swashbuckling fun Indiana-style,10,26 April 2000,"OK I know, we've seen it all before - no originality prizes obviously, but what an exciting movie this is! Much has been said on this Indiana Jones 'borrowing', but one must overlook the problems this movie obviously has.
However the point of a review is to do just that, so...Brendan Fraser is, it has to be said, no Harrison Ford. The quick wit is just not there, and that is how everyone could relate to Indiana Jones above all his fantastical heroics. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress wasted in this movie with bad casting and a bad script. John Hannah, also a very accomplished artiste, is similarly thrown away, with a character that mummification could perhaps be too soft to apply! Jerry Goldsmith's score is very Jerry Goldsmith. One wonders whether such a mature musician is trying to do too much these days, and it is films like this that suffer slightly, with the air of 'composing over breakfast' about it. The main theme is very nice, but a bit too similar to that of Dreamworks' PRINCE OF EGYPT, released a year earlier.But enough! This movie works on the lowest, but most comfortable of levels. The effects are astonishing (sadly suffering on the small screen, although this is excused by the amazing array of extra features on the DVD version). The script is bad, but hilarious in places (""There is a curse on this chest"" - ""Curse my ass..!""), and Arnold Vosloo plays a very convincing 3000-year old villain. A must for all action fans, and especially for those who want to re-live that day when we saw RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK for the first time!",The Mummy

The cinematography is decent but not overly the best, but it does add to the films nostalgic feel This film goes on to spawn two sequels and an spin off, but this is by far the best and most enjoyable of them all. Not really having aged in the past 15 years this film is def worth a view if you've never seen it.

Brief Nudity:Don't be fooled by this part (note I'm NOT one of those hormone-surging perverts),there was no nudity in this film just the princess in the film was wearing an incredibly revealing outfit - true she was almost nude but not enough to be ""must be covered not to be seen by children"" type of nudity,so basically there was no nudity. Sp.FX:Most of the Sp.FX in this film saved it from a much worse review,some of it actually helped to bring it down,The impressive:the Sp.FX in the beginning were actually the best as if they had help from the people of Pixar(Toy story,A Bug's Life),but after the ancient egypt prologue what wasn't in the unimpressive list did look well done but not as much in the prologue,unimpressive:I'll start with the mildest the face in the sand wasn't all that impressive,the 2nd worst the scarabs were more like leeches in this film & besides they more looked like little blue blobs than scarabs,now the worst the corpses(I can't really call them mummies which i'll get to in the plot),for the pre-teen to adult it'll more than likely nauseate you if you see the corpses on a moderately-to-full stomach & it places this film from the intended ""Well too scary for li'l kids"" to ""Would probably traumatize to at least place li'l kids in thearapy for a long while"" & the recently dead corpse's I'd wish the filmmakers were nice enough to block out the scenes of those corpses (but they wouldn't)Plot:A big problem to a big helper in this film,the plot is completelly weak & is rather bad at times(the only actual mummies in this film were the priests when they were mummified alive),& like what I'd said before the scarabs mostly were more like leeches,& the film was a big mild ""ROTLArk"" parody not too mention that after I'd seen the reviews here I'd have to admit the pilot guy was rather wasted,but the only light part of the Plot & film was the moderately funny one-liners they'd never contend to great comic films but at least it gives a comic break from most of the films plot(not to mention the ancient-egyptian love scandal during the prologue was a little weak too)Film Design:What most I can tell you here is more relev. to the other areas,So I tell you a couple of noticed film flubs,1 the anubis jar tops -1 of them is a brass St.Wrs Yoda head I'd kid you not, 2nd when im-ho-top got his arm chopped off you can see the metal wiring on the sliced off arm before he placed it back on So in short:the 2 main reasons why I saw this film were 1:a mother's day present for my mother I saw it with her,2: (I know there's still plenty of the year) but I saw it so I've actually seen a movie this year(the last time I'd went to the M.Theaters was seeing the Rugrats movie back in Dec.98),so even though most of the special effects were impressive & the one-liners were funny the rest of this film is a freaky-I.J stylish-monster-mummy movie.",The Mummy

There's also THE PRINCE OF EGYPT. Sommers injects the same brand of humor and comic relief like his previous movie.

The Mummy is much more of an adventure story (along the lines of the Indiana Jones films) than the tired, plodding retreads we have all come to expect from Hollywood these days.  The technical effects alone really make it quite worth watching.  The story, though familiar, is retold with imagination, wit and indeed some intellectual curiosity.   Brandon Fraser comports himself very well as the adventurer/hero (although what he was doing with the French Foreign Legion, or a Cairo jail some years later, in the opening scenes is never really explained- but that's a minor detail).  The heroine is not just the helpless fussy female for comic relief (as with the ""Temple of Doom"" or those Michael Douglas movies with Danny DiVito); she is a scholar, and plays pivotal roles in the story and plot.   The movie starts out in ancient Egypt, showing who the Mummy was (is) and why he was cursed.  The opening of the tomb, invoking of the curse, and prevention of the end of the world follow in short order.

270,asandor,A fun and campy adventure film,5,30 April 2020,"The Mummy, directed by Stephen Sommers, and starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, is a fun, now almost classic adventure film. This film heavily lays on the Indiana Jones style - with traps, treasure, tomb raiding and a good wallop of humour to go along with it. All of these things make for an overall enjoyable film, all things considered. The film follows Fraser as Rick O'Connell, roguish mercenary for hire, as he works with an expedition from an Egyptian museum. The expedition unleashes an ancient evil, that they then must survive, as a reanimated mummy seeks to achieve invulnerability and control Egypt!To start, I think this film is quite fun. Suitably hammy performances abound, with both Fraser and Weisz, as well as supporting actor John Hannah, bringing the camp. The premise of this movie is suitably campy - with mummies, ghosts and flesh eating scarabs abounding. Even so, these elements bring a level of enjoyment that is well suited to this type of film. The Mummy has become a good example of a camp film that is still quite a fun experience.To be sure, this film has its downsides. The CGI and animation have not aged well, showing the weakness of this type of visual presentation. Practical effects would have added some longevity to this film, and potentially brought it forward as a cult classic. There are some particularly eye rolling films that were horrifying to see in the 90's, but have not kept that particular feeling alive, to the detriment of the film. The acting in the film, while campy, can also be a bit cringey, especially from the Mummy itself, and many of the supporting characters. Some more believability, or going the other way, skilled camp, would have added some charm. Some side characters (notably the British pilot) are shallow and add absolutely nothing to the film.These all detract from what could have been a classic of cult cinema. Big box at its release, this film is none-the-less blowing its way into the background of film history, and while it is still fun, it is certainly not overly memorable. A film I enjoy watching, but with some issues.",The Mummy
271,DesertDogMedia,The Mummy,8,26 July 2014,"Title: The MummyCondensed Storyline: A group of explorers discover the lost city of Hamunaptra, they soon awaken the mummy who hunts them down one by one to assimilate their organs and bodily fluids. Notable Acting: Brendan Fraser is known for his role as Rick, and his role in the franchise is what some believe to have made the movie work in the first place. Needless to say, the other movies he's been in haven't been as good as his role here. Rachel Weisz plays the Evelyn who always needs rescuing as she is the damsel in distress. John Hannah plays everyones favourite coward Jonathan, he acts like a coward and ultimately is one in this movie and we love him for it. Kevin J. O'Connor plays a similar role to John Hannah in this movie but Kevin's character of Benny will side with who ever will give him money. Noticeable Camera work: The movie is great at faming up its shots, especially for scenes of torture of death, making it so you can't see it, but still grasp the feeling of what is going on. Time lapse of a couple thousand years while we are looking a the statue of Anubis. Dolly shots following the action in the first fight scene Worms eye view of the MedjaiGraphics: The CGI in this movie is great for its time, be it the CGI for the mummy or the scarabs, it is great. The mummy looks like it is there, the effects that have been used with the sand are convincing and make to be an amazing movie. Incorrect Science: The 'Book of the Dead' should be the 'Scroll of the Dead', because Ancient Egyptians didn't use books, they used scrolls only. The Roman Empire invented the book layout which is used today. Evelyn says that the scarabs ate Imhotep alive and very slowly, but every time we see them on screen, they always eat people within seconds. There were 5 canopic jars in the chest, but only 4 are used in actual mummification. Evelyn also mentions that they would take out all of the organs, this is incorrect as only the lungs, kidneys, intestines and stomach were put in canopic jars and the brain was removed and discarded. The heart and other organs were kept in. Imhotep fears cats because they are the guardians of the underworld, in actual Egyptian mythology, cats were worshiped as gods because they were connected to the goddess Bastet who was the goddess of motherhood and protection. The actual guardian of the underworld was Anubis who would guide the souls of the dead into the afterlife or the underworld. Overall Feel: When I was younger, I had an ingrained fascination with Egyptology and this film was one of my all time favourites. So much so I watched this movie (Which is rated 15 for DVD) and I watched it over and over being only single digits in age at the time. So I will try and be not so bias in my review. This movie has its fair share of faults, especially when it comes to knowing about Ancient Egypt, but I would blame this more on the screen writers than anyone else. This is movie was made a year after Deep Rising, using a similar horror theme along with the actor Kevin J. O'Connor. Before this franchise, there were only mummy movies for the 'golden era' of cinema, which had the notoriously bad and some what cheesy effects that you would expect which classic monster movies, this movie made mummies cool again. This movie does have jump scares, but they are mild and are just there for the characters in the movie more than the audience.",The Mummy
272,o-31546,The Mummy in 1999,8,15 June 2017,"Recently, The new movie of Tom Cruise -- The Mummy (2017) has shown in cinema. As the new start of the old series, it brings limited feeling of freshness, compared with The Mummy (1999). When I was a child, The Mummy (1999) became a nightmare of me. After watching the new movie of Tom Cruise, I really think the old one is much better than the new one. This film is very predictable in the manner in which it is carried out. The formula of hero saves the girl, hero kills the villain, and hero saves the planet is tired and old, but it will be the addition of humor, special effects, and Fraser as a brilliant action hero that will carry this movie for most viewers.

273,Pythe,"Solid adventure film, one of my favorites",8,17 March 2008,"The Mummy is definitely not a great film from an objective standpoint; there are an awful lot of plot holes and things that don't make a great deal of sense, and the characters often do things for no other reason than that the plot dictates they must. Still, Stephen Sommers hits the perfect balance of epic adventure, humor, and thrills to make the quintessential popcorn movie. The Mummy is sort of like those old creature features you used to stay up and watch on late night television, except that it's actually fun and silly and doesn't take itself seriously whatsoever.The cast is perfect, the photography is gorgeous (particularly in the desert sequences), the jokes are, if not hilarious, at least harmless enough, the special effects are decent but limited by the technology of the time, and the music is pretty good. This is a movie that knows what it's trying to do and achieves it perfectly. Too bad Sommers hasn't yet replicated the experience in his more recent duds.",The Mummy
274,m0rg16,Good action movie,8,9 February 2004,"This movie is a remake of the old classic ""The Mummy"" movie. But of course, they changed alot of things around. Which is good. Why bother with making a remake if you're just going to make it exactly like the old one? If you're gonna do a remake, why not do it with some style? And this is what this movie accomplishes. Instead of a horror movie, we are given an action/adventure movie, with much fitting comedic elements. But there are some creepy moments in the film, and I have to say I would be interested in seeing a horror movie based on this story. But for now, this will do.Brendan Fraser plays Rock O'Connell; a mercenary hired by some unknown group. After he gets chased away from the city of the dead, hamunaptra, by ghosts he is sent to jail when he arrives in Cairo, for trying to have ""a good time"". Enter: Jonathan (Brilliantly played by John Hannah) who just happens to steal a nifty little gadget from Rick's pocket while visiting the Cairo jail. He shows it to his sister, Evelyn, and she recognizes it to be of some importance. They manage to get Rick out of jail, and in return he has to lead them to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead.On their way to Hamunaptra they stumble upon another adventure and treasure seeking party, which is most unfortunate, because it is this reckless group that eventually let loose the title character: The Mummy. The Mummy's, or Imhotep's (that's his real name), mission is to destroy all living beings on earth, starting with those who let him loose. Now it's up to Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan to stop him before he can accomplish his goal.The story is good enough to keep the movie going, and it's not in the least confusing which means we'll get a semi-braindead action film without any hassle of lack of story or to much action. The movie is a perfect mix between plot and action sequences, and this is great thanks to the director Stephen Sommers. This movie is definetly worth a rent, or even a buy if you take a shine to it. And if you liked this movie, I also recommend the sequel: The Mummy Returns, which continues in the same style as this movie.8/10 - Perfect mix of storyline and action gives us a really, really good action/adventure movie with some really funny scenes thrown in here and there.",The Mummy

The Mummy offers a whole lot of shooting and plenty of nice laughs. It's the type you could watch with friends or family. A great big adventure, and an excellent blend of Ancient tomb's with a hilarious discovery team. ( the cast)The acting was spot on. Brendan Fraser is one that stood out, his witty lines and his eager to shoot things is constant in The Mummy, he's powerful and funny. Without him the movie may not been so brilliant. Read the plot and you know that it's going to be 1 or 2 hours of fun and adventure. Arnold Vosloo does excellent in playing his role. He had the right look and was determined which made his character very believable. The majority of the cast offered laughs.A great idea. The world need's a movie like this; a fun ride with nice action and clever wit. The special effects were too superior, there were some nice tricks (partically the one in the desert) The tomb's and the mummy's look very ancient yet very real.

There's plenty of action and horror, but the movie doesn't take any of it seriously for even a minute.  You're laughing too hard to be scared; writer/director Stephen Sommers knows his subject matter is silly, and he gives the film the perfect tone.Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster have been revived in recent years, so it seems only natural that The Mummy would have enjoy a big-budget remake as well.

The story is ooooollllllddddd.  Expedition looking for a lost city and find the mummy's tomb---wow, how original.  The dialogue is pathetic; the acting--well, who cares about acting in a summer movie (by the way, it's lousy); and nonstop special effects.  That's the problem.  It's way too special effects heavy. You're constantly being bombarded with reanimated corpses, sand storms, locusts, flesh-eating beetles, etc. etc. etc.  It just wears you down after awhile.  At a few points I just prayed for the effects to stop and have a plot take over.  But then when people DID stop and talk the dialogue was so mindbogglingly awful, I prayed for the special effects!  So, if you don't mind a plot as old as the mummy itself, lousy acting and special effects bombarding you constantly, this is your movie.  Otherwise stay far, far away.",The Mummy

An Old Kingdom Egyptian priest, Imhotep, was sentenced to eternal imprisonment and live mummification through a curse after having an affair with a Pharoah's mistress and murdering him.

This film definitely had it all, people killing for no reason, evil triumphing over good, the true love that the mummy has being not developed properly (at least until the second film).
The acting is as you would expect, which means that it was bad. 
The story is as comical as any. 
The inability to harm the major characters fits with the culture.In conclusion, if you go into this expecting anything other than some good cinematography, you are an idiot.
If you enjoyed it, don't watch the next two films. Be happy that you saw the best in the series and end it there.

285,Colonel Ted,A decent summer blockbuster,7,9 February 2000,"Loathed by the critics, but a huge hit at the box office, this updating of the 1930's Karloff classic provides solid entertainment at the cinema. It's not as good as The Matrix (although the plot is easier to understand), but far better than The Phantom Menace, The Mummy owes more to Indiana Jones than Karloff. Fraiser plays French Legionnaire Rick O'Connell who is rescued from death by Evie (Weisz) and Jonathan (Hannah) Carnahan to help them search for the Lost City of Hamunaptra. Unfortunately they end up awakening The Mummy of the title (a CGI clad Vosloo) who naturally causes havoc. Sommers' script is rather flawed. There are a few too many jokes about smelly Arabs and for the most characterisation and a bumpy romance between Fraiser and Weiez has been sacrificed to the action. This is certainly no Lawrence of Arabia as well, as there is a distinct lack of atmosphere to the film. Hannah is badly cast as Evie's work shy brother. Although he does get quite a few laughs, he is never convincing as a stuck up toff. Frasier is charismatic enough to carry the film and makes a good hero, although he's not a patch on Harrison Ford. However any flaws are more than compensated by the action which is superb, thrilling and spectacular as Sommers piles on the effects, the explosions, and the fights. These include a sandstorm, thousands of bugs, a recreation of Plagues of Egypt, plus the CGI Mummy itself. It you check you brain at the door, then The Mummy is good harmless fun.",The Mummy

Rachel Weisz is ""Evelyn,"" a 1920s British Egyptologist who strikes a treasure hunting deal with Rick and promptly starts building some serious romantic chemistry with him in the classic push-pull, I despise you, I must have you vein. The buried 'something big' is the property of ""Imhotep,"" Arnold Vosloo's long dead (but not really) high priest of ancient Egyptian myth and magic. Imhotep is more of a plague, pox, locust, scorpion, sandstorm type of guy, someone for whom the kittenish tete-a-tetes between Rick and Evelyn hold no charm. Oded Fehr and John Hannah come on screen in strong supporting performances to help Rick and Evelyn avoid Imhotep's wrath. The entirety of the film has an old-timey Saturday matinée feel to it, and although it doesn't rise to the level of a blockbuster summer feature, you could describe it to a novice as perhaps the best B movie of cinema's modern era. Much of the film's core appeal goes back to the spirited acting Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz supply, and to their significant chemistry together. Although romance must take a back seat to danger in an archaeology adventure flick, it bears noting that their chemistry as a couple is decidedly more compelling than the Indy and Marian pairing in ""Raiders."" As Raiders is the superior film, that is saying an awful lot about The Mummy's likability quotient, which is high.",The Mummy

289,Aphex97,Comic book fun with great modern special effects.,8,19 May 2001,"The Mummy is a pseudo-remake of the 1932 Karloff picture of the same name. This modern Mummy is not like any monster Mummy I've ever seen before. I commend the film makers for making a modern version of this classic monster. Arnold Vosloo plays the antagonist well, he is not the traditional mummy that hobbles about wrapped in bandages. This Mummy is strong, quick ,powerful, has plenty of tricks up the proverbial sleeve, and really is just plain downright menacing. I can't say enough good things about the actual monster and the very flashy special effects used in connection with his powers (e.g. the wall of sand with his face). I give the monster and related effects a 10/10. The plot is pretty good (despite some large continuity problems). Two groups of treasure hunters find a much sought after legendary lost city in Egypt, only to accidentally awaken the Mummy, and thus fulfill a 3000 year-old prophecy of a great curse and plague on the Earth. Now they must save the world. The whole movie has the feel of a live action comic book, which makes Brendan Fraiser's zanyness a great choice as the lead actor. He is surprisingly competent as the kick ass action hero spewing enough one-liners to make Arnold proud. The role doesn't require a lot of ability, and he fills the shoes of the zany American hero well. All the characters (except the monster) are comic book type characters (e.g. the yeeee-haaa cowboy Americans, the bumbling coward brother, the weasel bad guy Benny, etc...).
FINAL RATING: 8/10 The characters don't run that deep but they don't really need to because the story is interesting enough by itself. The great constant action, the excellent scenery, and very cool special effects make a good movie, but Vosloo as the Mummy is the real star here. Consider me impressed. Noob Aalox",The Mummy

Not only the special effects, but apparently the story as well, were created by a computer. The FX were were often awful because the computer graphics were so obvious. I am beginning to think that computer FX are an increasing problem because what looks great on a 20"" inch monitor looks truly fake on a 60' wide theater screen.Brendan Frasier reverted to his George of the Jungle personna, which was another disappointment.I could say more, but why waste more time?

296,TheOneManBoxOffice,A rather fun adventure romp!,7,8 July 2017,"The original version of ""The Mummy"" from 1932 was one of a series of monster movies made famous by Universal Pictures. Directed by Karl Freund, and following in the footsteps of the likes of Todd Browning's ""Dracula"" (1931) and James Whale's ""Frankenstein"" (1931), it was a horror classic about a mummified Egyptian priest called Imhotep who was inadvertently brought back to life after an archaeologist reads an ancient spell, and then prowls the city of Cairo intending to revive his lover, the Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. It was a hit, and it became one of several movies that make up the Universal Monsters franchise.65 years later, because the revivals of different movie monsters were becoming hits in the '90s, the studio decided to remake the original 1932 film, only instead of having it a straight-up horror movie, they take the Indiana Jones route and made it a swashbuckling adventure movie. As a result, we have a movie that's more of an original work than a direct remake of a black and white movie from the 1930s.3,000 years ago, the high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) suffers a fate worse than death as punishment after desecrating the tomb of Anck-Su Namun (Patricia Velásquez), wife of Pharaoh Seti I and Imhotep's lover. The punishment: live mummification and the worst of all Egyptian curses where, if brought back to life, would unleash hell upon all of the land, plagues and all. Unfortunately, 3,000 years later, two teams of treasure hunters set up a digging site in the lost city of Hamunaptra and come across Imhotep's sarcophagus, and the book of the dead (not to be confused with the one in the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy). One night, one of the treasure hunters, a librarian named Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) decides to give said book a read. Bad idea, as the book contains the passage that brings Imhotep back to life. Imhotep's revived, he still wants to bring back his lover Ankh-Su Namun, and everyone's screwed. So it's up to our ragtag team of heroes, which include Evelyn, her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), and Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) to reverse the curse and save the world.Whether you think the history behind Ancient Egypt or figures like Ankh-Su Namun or Imhotep are accurate or not (fun fact: it's not even close) is irrelevant for a movie like this. What matters is that this is is an adventure flick done in the style of Spielberg and Lucas' ""Indiana Jones"" franchise. Yes, the plot can get pretty silly at times and the main hero of the picture, Rick, is more of a wisecracking jackass best suited for an action comedy. That's also not to mention that some of the CGI hasn't really aged that well since the movie's release in 1999. However, for your standard adventure movie fare, ""The Mummy"" is a fun movie in its own right, and a lot of the effects seen in the movie were groundbreaking for the time, so I gotta give credit where credit is due.The movie reached #1 at the box office upon release, and the director of the film, Stephen Sommers, has stated in an interview that a day after the movie was released in theatres, Universal Pictures contacted him over the phone and said ""We need another one!"". Thus, the film spawned two sequels: ""The Mummy Returns"" in 2001, and ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" in 2008. A video game would also be made and published by Konami in 2000, and yes, even an animated television series would be released. As for the movie itself, it's still a fun romp to watch, and with the new re-imagining already released in theatres this year starring Tom Cruise, it would definitely be worth seeing this film again before going to see that one, and even if the newer one sucks, at least you have this one and the original 1932 film to keep you company.",The Mummy

I really can't pick this movie apart. There is so much going on and it moves quite fast, that I was never bored! The special effects were top rate, the acting was fine and the story was interesting. It has the same spirit as ""Indiana Jones,"" but by all means, do not compare it to those movies. This movie is a little more comic book style than the Indy movies. It has a few scary moments, but most of it is the ""idea"" of what is going on (like when the mummy comes back to take the remaining body parts of a man whom he had already taken is eyes and tongue. You could feel his terror!) I was very impressed that the profanity and gore was light and there was no full nudity (there was a woman wearing revealing mesh, but that is the extent of it.)

There's simply too many set-piece action sequences that aren't quite grand enough to hit the spot, leaving me a little jaded. The beginning and ending sections are much better but still a little bland for my tastes. The effects are great, but then aren't they always in such cgi-tastic movies?Here in the UK, the Indiana Jones trilogy was screened about a month previous, and with the memory of those still fresh in my mind (I hadn't seen them for a good while) this didn't match up in the action/comedy adventure category.Still - it's worth a watch if you want something light.

If there was a single cliche they did not utilize for this film, I'm not sure what it was. About the only things left from the 1932 ""Mummy"", of which this is supposed to be a remake, are a couple of names and several paraphrased lines of dialogue. Oh, and the fact that it takes place in Egypt.  Arnold Vosloo is quite enjoyable as the mummy, in both CGI and human form. Too bad he's not on screen more. There are some ""big"" gags in the film, involving huge set pieces (i.e.; the collapsing library) that are rather uninvolving--the full house audience I saw this with barely chuckled as the bookcases fell, domino style.

What do people like about these movies? They're fun? Is frying ants with a magnifying glass fun? In my short life, I've probabley seen about 300 movies with a spot of dialouge not unlike Brendan Frasers line ""Oh no, we're in trouble"", when faced with a huge disaster mere seconds away.

Unless you count the amazing contradiction present here, there's really nothing special about this film. The acting was sub-par at best. The lack of even the most base character development eliminated my concern for them and therefore the ""horror"" scenes seemed both typical, far-fetched and inconsistent at the same time.Lots of little discrepancies (no Africans, no blood, infinitely loaded guns, sewer systems in the desert, collapsing pyramids...), plagued this film. The CG, which is undoubtedly superb in it's own right, was WAAAY overdone and looked really bad on-screen.  There is such a thing as too much.  I remember thinking at one point, ""This looks more like FMV cut in a video game than a movie.""  Arnold Vosloo (Imhotep) didn't even (re)appear until nearly the middle of the movie.  On the plus side, I think the best performance was done by Beni, a snivelling little weasel played by Kevin J. O'Connor, who became Imhotep's minion and had the best lines of all. Rachel Weisz did a decent job with her role as well.  Frasier was stiff, out of place and apparently, completely indestructable.  The same, however, can NOT be said about the Mummy.  Better off rented.",The Mummy

313,Clockwork-Avacado,"Indiana Jones meets Hellraiser, but with better actors",6,4 November 2013,"Totally disregard any previous ""Mummy"" films before going to see this. Not because this is the definitive effort, but just for the simple reason that this has nothing to do with any of them. It's a family-friendly version, with a lot of rather unnecessary CGI throughout, and far more gags than genuine shocks. It's your standard action/adventure movie, and yet, it still is reasonably entertaining. But the biggest disappointment of all, is the fact that there isn't really a mummy in the entire movie. Instead, in a plot exactly lifted from Clive Barker's original ""Hellraiser"" movie, we have a decomposing, cursed man who must drain his victims dry, to rebuild himself physically. Not exactly original.What does make rather a nice change, though, is the fact that both our leads are capable and seem to be having a lot of fun, rather than the po-faced posing we're so used to seeing in movies these days. Brendan Fraser is a capable and solid enough hero, who, despite his constant dry quips, is not at all arrogant, and has a quiet believability to him totally unlike your average action hero. Rachel Weisz, back before the dark days of ""Constantine"", is charming and talented, and there is a great chemistry between the two of them that keeps the movie alive. The vast swathe of other characters, largely comic grotesques, range form John Hannah's likable buffoon, to Kevin J O'Connors' weaselly little git. Connor manages to get even more and more annoying in each scene, and whilst he isn't the only thing wrong with this movie, cutting him out entirely would improve this movie no end.Arnold Vosloo is a fairly by-numbers villain, who adds little beyond a certain imposing physicality to the role, although he does look good in the role. His love interest, though, Patricia Velasquez, is phenomenal, and if ever there was a woman worth suffering a living death for, it must just be her. Velasquez has less than five minutes screen-time, but makes her presence acutely felt, with her elaborate, painted on costume, the most visually stunning element of the entire movie.The story putters along, with some impressively staged action scenes, with great stunt-work throughout. It's just a shame that the horror content wasn't half as good as the stunt-work, because then we'd have a proper ""Mummy"" film. Instead, rather than being at all creepy, all the supernatural elements are handled with heavy CG. Vast biblical plagues are realised effectively enough, but the over-the-top nature of most of the CG threats - plagues of millions of beetles you can escape by side-stepping, plagues of locusts you can avoid by staying indoors, huge walls of sand, etc - aren't written compotently enough to be exciting. The main problem is the old chestnut of the all-powerful villain, who somehow gets defeated. They've amped up Imhotep's powers so much, that he's a supernatural entity who can do anything with a thought - so how does he get so easily defeated? Lesson learned here - don't give your villain unlimited powers, or else we'll just be massively disappointed when he finally gets beaten, and this movie is no exception.There is a strong comedy quotient in this movie, where tension is never allowed to be built up, without immediately being diffused by a joke, or someone making light of the situation. It creates the jaunty, entertaining tone, but, unlike most movies, it doesn't go away as the stakes get higher. Our characters make jokes, and are engaged in comic set-pieces right up until the very end. The more fun tone is fine to begin with, but it gets a bit tiresome towards the end, when things should be getting a lot more serious.Dramatically, ""The Mummy"" is heavily flawed. The CGI is far too over-used, the threat amped up to totally unrealistic proportions, which only succeed in being faintly disappointing. But, Fraser and Weisz are good leads. Jerry Goldsmith delivers a very traditionalist soundtrack, which largely goes un-noticed in the chaos. The first half is fun, reasonably exciting, heavily action-packed, and funny without being silly. Sadly, the end gets rather flat, and the build-up we've had, where we're waiting to finally see the mummy, is rudely shattered by a rather shoddy piece of CGI.To be honest, it could have been a lot worse. It's very casually entertaining, made for audiences with a short-attention span, who laugh at gag after gag because they don't have the patience to follow a plot, or sustain an atmosphere. It's rubbish compared to the Hammer movie, but, compared to today's blockbusters, there's something charmingly human about it all.",The Mummy
314,FilmSchoolWriter,"""Rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world.""",8,21 October 2006,"Stephen Sommers' ""The Mummy"" (1999) is exactly what a summer action-adventure flick should be. ""The Mummy"" begins in ancient Egypt when the Pharaoh's choice concubine, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez) and High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), kill the Pharaoh and Anck Su Namun kills herself. Heartbroken, Imhotep attempts to raise her from the dead, but is stopped by the Pharaoh's guards. For his crime, Imhotep is mummified alive and cursed, never to enter the after life. But in 1923, an archaeological dig awakens the Mummy. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her brother, Jonathon (John Hannah), vow to destroy the Mummy. They are aided by the mysterious Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), a man who's people have guarded the Mummy for centuries. When I first saw the cast list for ""The Mummy"", I was skeptic; Brendan Fraser as an action hero? But he pulls it off and is exactly what the character of Rick requires- a goofy guy who somehow manages to save the world. Weisz is wonderful as well. Surprisingly, Evelyn Carnahan is a dimensional character, rather than just some floozy stuck into the film as a romantic interest for our hero. But the best performance has to go to John Hannah. Whenever he is on screen, I can't take my eyes off of him and I laugh at almost every line he utters. As it is a Stephen Sommers film, the special effects are of course amazing  for 1999 at least, and are quite good even now. I like to call the mummy a ""pre-Pirates of the Caribbean creature"". But it's great despite the major advancements since then. The script is also well done (it was written by Sommers as well), containing some incredibly entertaining dialogue and plot twists. If you are like me and enjoy action-adventure films, than ""The Mummy"" is another film you must see. Definitely in my top 10 films.",The Mummy
315,pearlinasilverbasin,Enjoyable in a campy way,8,18 November 2018,"The Mummy is an enjoyable movie that somehow has the nostalgic atmosphere of the movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The supporting actors are charming and funny (especially Rachel Weisz and Brendan Fraser). This movie is not perfect; it has several plot holes, isn't very historically or artistically accurate, and the ""horror"" scenes are more laughable than scary. However, it's not supposed to be taken very seriously anyways, more to be watched for some Indiana Jones-like pretenseless fun, preferably with some friends while drinking from a mug of hot chocolate. Really the only big thing I have to say against it is that the marketing made the film look more serious or horror-like than it really was.",The Mummy

Egypt offers so much to any storyteller to go mad with, yet no one does.Here we have a film with fantastic special effects, a pretty scary idea, (playing on the old curse of the pharoahs) and a reasonable cast.  The opportunity to create bone shaking myths and to bring something otherworldly into 'The Mummy' was missed.  Instead we are treated to a run-of-the-mill action film, with cheesy lines that, unlike Armageddon, just aren't funny. Rachel Whatever battles bravely to introduce some acting to cinemagoers, but all to no avail as Brendan Fraser and the zany fella with the fez all but mess it up.Despite the amazing stories that constitute Egypt's history, Raiders of the Lost Ark remains the best film to touch upon that magnificent country.",The Mummy
317,averjee,"Oh, for Indiana Jones 4",5,15 May 1999,"This is a very loose remake of the great horror classic of 1932, which was more of a romance (the mummy was brought to life by his love for his woman) and was aided by a wonderfully poignant performance by Boris Karloff as a long-dead priest who returns to life and falls in love with the modern reincarnation of the woman he died for. The 1932 was slack-paced, and the chills there were the result of the slow reincarnation of the mummy.Maybe that worked on audiences in 1932, but apparently today's audiences want less romance, more shocks and more special effects. Or maybe, today's filmmakers just lack the vision and imagination to do what filmmakers of yore, like Karl Freund and Alfred Hitchcock, were able to do.The kid in me loves all-stops-out adventure movies with nifty special effects, especially when there is a treasure at the end of the journey.Unfortunately, this remake of the 1932 Boris Karloff horror-flick doesn't deliver on it's wonderful premise. There is really nothing to say in favor of this movie: the script is predictable, the characters low-rent and shallow knock-offs of Indiana Jones and his RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK colleagues, and the acting is nothing special.Only the special effects are notable for their quality, especially the raging sandstorms that take on human features and the flesh-eating scarab beetles which crawl under your flesh and scurry about like demonic hockey pucks.",The Mummy

320,niteman,Indiana Jones Lite,8,12 May 1999,"The Mummy is, at heart, an adventure serial from the 1930's, which means it is in the same genre as the Indiana Jones films.  While it never achieves the excitement and awe that those movies brought to the big screen, it has its moments.The cast, for the most part, is outstanding.  Brendan Fraser plays another variation on his hunky-cartoony persona, swaggering and swashbuckling like an old pro.  Rachel Weisz is great as the feisty love interest, sort of a Lara Croft for the 1930's.  The chemistry between the two is real, and their dialog is witty and exciting.Arnold Vosloo makes a somewhat disappointing mummy, however.  He never seems very menacing -- largely because he looks more like a high school math professor than a mighty lord of the undead, with his doe eyes and pudgy face.Whether or not you like the special effects in the film will depend largely on how you feel about computer animation.  There are some shots, particularly of the mummy, that look like low-grade ""Hercules&Xena"" quality effects, a surprise since the effects were done by Industrial Light&Magic. Some of it works, some doesn't, and it all would have looked better with models and makeup (but I'm old fashioned).Regardless, the movie is cheery, exciting, and fun.  There is an element of ""Army of Darkness"" style camp which is good for laughs, but it also delivers some  good old-fashioned thrills and chills.No one will ever mistake The Mummy for a masterpiece -- it's too  slick, too post-modern, and at times embarrassingly silly (like the beginning, where characters stand around spouting plot exposition as if they're pitching us the movie).  But it's well worth the 6 or 7 dollars to see on the big screen.",The Mummy
321,Adec,A rollicking good adventure...,8,4 July 1999,"First let me preface this review, this is not, despite what some would have you believe, a horror film, it's purely an adventure film and should be viewed as such. Secondly, I've never seen the 1932 original, so as to just how similar the two films are I honestly don't know (although at a hunch I'd guess that the answer to that one would be 'not very').Okay now let's get down to business. I must say right off that this film quite surprised me, I wasn't expecting it to be anywhere near as much fun as it was after seeing the trailer advertised over the last couple of months, it looked like just another of the recent trend of vacuous blockbusters, all effects and little charm or plot, we all know the films that fit into this ever expanding category, 'Godzilla', 'The Avengers', 'Batman And Robin' and 'Lost In Space' being some of the worst offenders in recent times.However 'The Mummy' is not one of those films, in fact it's a Hell of a lot of fun, and while far from perfect it has a charm to it that carries everything through to the end with gusto. Like director Stephen Sommers previous film 'Deep Rising' this isn't deep (if you'll pardon the pun), it's just big dumb tongue in cheek fun, and all the more enjoyable for not trying to convince you that its any more than that.Stephen Sommers' direction is fine, but lacks a little something, a certain spark or energy that would elevate this film from 'very good' to 'great' fun. The script by Sommers, LLoyd Fonvielle and Kevin Jarre, and based on the original 1932 Mummy script by John L. Balderston, suffers a similar fate. It manages to sustain the fun throughout without ever really nailing it down perfectly.Performance wise Brendan Fraser is quite well suited to this kind of role and is a very appealing lead, and is obviously having a ball with the role, while Rachel Weisz plays the slightly ditzy heroine well and John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Erick Avari, Bernard Fox, Omid Djalili and especially Oded Fehr and (for once quite effective) comic relief sidekick Kevin J. O'Connor also adding significantly to the overall fun of the film.Also boasting some nicely handled cinematography by Adrian Biddle and some effective (and at times quite clever) FX, 'The Mummy' is big budget entertainment for the masses done well.While it's not quite in the 'Indiana Jones' league, 'The Mummy' is quite an enjoyable film all in all and well worth your time and money, especially if you love a good adventure film. Good value.8/10",The Mummy
322,pip-7,One heck of a ride!,9,20 July 2001,"I have seen lots of action adventure movies ever since I was a little brat. Some are very exciting while others are plain dumb or boring. The Mummy is one of the movies that surpass my expectations and yes, it's really, really fun to watch despite its corny script (hey, all action movies tend to have CORNY dialogues, no doubt). In fact, The Mummy is based on a 1932 movie of the same name. While the original movie is slow and horrifying at its best, this latest incarnation has lots of cool sequences that cause our jaws to drop in amazement. Wow, as I have said a million times, WOW! I mean that it's an AWESOME movie that even make Indiana Jones proud. As I watch it from the beginning to the end of the film, I'm truly speechless.The movie takes in 1923 where several archaeologists stumble upon Imhotep's tomb in Hamunaptra. When the dead priest is finally brought back to life (thanks to Miss Evelyn Carnahan who is obviously curious about the Book of the Living), things get really destructive as Imhotep unleashes incredible powers that would destroy the entire world. So, it is up to our heroic Rick O'Connell to end this madness once and for all.If you wonder what makes the movie enjoyable, there are two reasons: interesting characters and special effects. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz make a perfect couple while the maniacal Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Connor) is best suited as a spoilt jester. The rest of the cast members are also truly exceptional especially Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay. And now for the special effects: they are truly unbelievable, from the falling meteors sequences and hair-raising escape from the sandstorm to a grand showdown with Imhotep, you will not going to miss this one out.If you are satisfied with the first movie, perhaps you want to watch the even more fantastic sequel, the Mummy Returns (I really need to watch this one too!!).",The Mummy
323,JonB-2,"Universal's Standby Horror Flick, Unwrapped",8,19 June 1999,"""The Mummy"" is nothing more than a fun ride, that delivers all the chills and thrills as it should.  However, it's not an action film for which you need to leave your brain outside; the filmmakers paid attention to the rules, and stick to them.  In addition, they finally give us an action heroine who is not reduced to ""Screaming bimbo in need of rescue at the end.""  In fact, it's the female lead, and not the male, who ultimately defeats the big villain, in defiance of all previous film tradition.The special effects are amazing and seamless, with some see-through mummy effects that work very well, and a quartet of murderous zombies that evoke the memory of Ray Harryhausen, then go him one (or two or three) better.On top of all that, the acting and casting in this movie is right on the mark -- Fraser, as always, is marvellous, and every minor character has that ""Gosh, I know them from somewhere"" but yet you don't feeling that is so essential to the genre.  (Kevin J. O'Connor is wonderful as a really, really snivelly nasty minor villain who you do and don't want to see get what he deserves -- and he also gives the constant impression of being someone more well known than he is.  He seems very familiar and yet (check his credits here) he isn't.But, anyway -- ""The Mummy"" is worth seeing just as a real fun ride that goes one better than the original.

The scarabs sent chills down my spine, and the Egyptian setting just adds to the atmosphere.I am an Egypt freak, and this movie certainly adds to the mystery and attraction of the ancient culture. The temples, the outfits, the royal scandal, make this an interesting plot, but in some points the scenes are a little corny.The dialogue is funny and clever, but sometimes falls short.

326,shushens,Everything a royal adventure should be!,9,20 March 2008,"9 may seem way too much for an adventure film with not many under-the-surface messages if any at all, but believe me folks, it is well deserved! Since I was a little boy, anything and everything pertaining to Ancient Egyptian culture intrigued me like did nothing else. That is not really a very rare trait I had. But pitifully, it has never been much exploited by the almighty Hollywood. Other than cheap B-movies that dealt with cursed ankhs giving archeologists (who look like Peter North) a heightened libido, Egypt was not a context of mainstream film-making. Not many gifted directors tried to look into the real deal. Just like the concept of vampires, the concept of mummies coming back to life to take care of unfinished business (as funny as that may sound) has mostly been a context of derision, until Stephen Sommers.Unlike the old fashioned directors with a patriotic agenda, modern America has produced a handful of gifted directors such a Stephen Sommers and Gore Verbinski. Instead of sweating their brains over ridiculous conspiracies inside CIA and FBI, Stephen Sommers made something which can be loved and enjoyed 100% by a person of just about any age group and ethnicity. He made use of beliefs and fantasies that were around for hundreds of years, if not thousands, but were never properly utilized before. It is a very difficult task to make a film which promises absolute entertainment in every single scene. To accomplish that, the director needs to be obsessed with the myths and legends himself. No one made TITANIC before James Cameron because they could not relate to the theme at the core of their heart. For exactly the same reason, The Mummy is truly the first of its kind.Many people said this is more like the return of Indiana Jones. But is it truly? Indy had been to Egypt. We saw some real state-of-the-art camera work in there. But can anyone recall feeling even remotely fascinated about Egypt after watching Raiders of the Lost Ark? Egypt was more like a ground where Indy beat the Nazis in their own game. It could have been Madagascar instead and there would be no basic difference. It also had many not-so-sublime messages of communalism, which I did not dislike personally, but drastically lowered the cinematic value of the motion picture.With once-in-a-lifetime performances from Brenden Fraser, Rachel Weisz and Oded Fehr, backed by a truly mindblowing musical score from Jerry Goldsmith and awe-inspiring photography and art direction, The Mummy is a film for those who are in love with Egypt, dying to get a true flavour but annoyed and bored with the cheap ideations. It is also for those who love no-nonsense memorable adventure films with the perfect balance of humour. Humour plays a very crucial role in just about any film. Filmmakers often seem to overdo it or leave it out of the equation. This film shows a wonderful balance of seriousness and humour. A little more humour and it could be sadly comic, a little less could make things a little less entertaining.There is no point in trying to explore if everything shown in this film has historical significance or value, though some of the things indeed do. Watch this film to seek true charm, and charmed you shall be! What better background can there be to embellish the story-canvas of obscure passion and exotic desires with than ancient Egypt? This is one of the 10 most memorably entertaining films I have seen. After watching it a hundred times over, I feel childishly thrilled to watch it from the start again. Same goes for the sequel ""The Mummy Returns"", though I would not rate it so high. There is no time like the first time!A timeless exotic adventure classic.",The Mummy
327,sherbetsaucers,"You Call Him Dr Jones, Maybe?",7,6 February 2007,"This is less a remake and more a re-imagining of the original Mummy movie. Where as the Boris Karloff version is pretty much an out and out 1930's horror, this is very much an action adventure in the style of Indiana Jones, a movie that The Mummy cannot help being compared to.Much like Indiana Jones it harks back to the Saturday matinées of years gone by, but with a budget. The plot is, of course, simple. Ancient evil lovable rogue race against time comedy characters yadda yadda yadda. Let's be frank; this is standard adventure stuff, but here it is done well. Very well.What this movie excels in is set scenes. Considering that this is an action flick it of course should be a given but let's be honest, it isn't always. From a wonderful opening sequence set in the past we have a fantastic 'Time Passes' effect to a bunch of Legionnaires facing off against the approaching Arab hordes. This pretty much sets the tone for the whole movie. From biplanes to river boat battles, this movie has everything you could really ask for. The highlight being a Harryhausen tribute with Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell battling re-animated mummies. How he manages to look so dashing with his tongue stuck so firmly in his cheek I'll never know.Which brings me to the true strength of this movie, the humour. Again, much like Indiana Jones, The Mummy is a movie that is prepared to not take itself too seriously, but without verging into the overly camp, a trick that writer/director Summers failed to pull off with Van Helsing.. However the humour in The Mummy is even more pronounced than with Jones. Kevin J. O'Connor and Omid Djalili both create fantastic comedy side-kick types that manage to actually be funny, as opposed to just grating. But even the main stars show a flair for comedy. John Hannah's one line deliveries are bang on and Fraser, who has already played the comic role in movies such as George of the Jungle and California Man has a fantastic sense of timing. However the big 'comedy surprise' for me with this movie is the Leading Lady; (with this kind of movie, that term just feels right) Rachel Weisz. Her reactions to the insanity around her are fantastic, and she also provides us with one of the biggest laughs in the film as she single handedly destroys a library in a moment reminiscent of any number Howard Shore or Buster Keaton movies.This movie is wonderful and, while some of the scenes may be frightening for young children, I think it is great fun for all the family.",The Mummy

(3/10),3,6 May 2002,"[I saw this on network TV, YMMV]Well, I've seen worse (Batman and Robin and Lost in Space come to mind), but this was pretty bad.Here is a scene that tells you all you need to know:  The good guys need a plane to get back to the bad guy's hideout.  They happen to find some fat Brit with an RAF biplane to help them out.  Two good guys can't fit so they are tied on the end of the plane.  A boatload of special effects later, the bad guy causes the plane to crash.  Who survives?  All of the good guys (even those strapped to the wings).  Who dies?  The fat Brit (the only one strapped into a seat).The plot is nonexistant.  The story is a bad guy comes back to life, steals the girl, and the good guys rescue the girl.  THAT'S IT.  NO MORE.  Fifth graders can write better than this.  The movie makers rely on a ton of ho-hum special effects to fill in all the dead time.This movie is not funny, not scary, does not have ground-breaking special effects, and was just a waste of time and money.",The Mummy

330,Heresy,Awful,2,3 April 2000,I went in expecting very little and was still disappointed. The bad acting and horrible dialog continually distracted from the special effects (the only decent part of the film.) And now I see they are making a 'The Mummy 2'? I guess any big budget film that somehow makes over $100million gets a sequel now (no matter how abysmal the original.),The Mummy
331,Irish-Sunglasses,A waste of two hours,1,25 May 1999,"Too bad I can't get back the two hours of my life that I wasted watching this typical piece of Hollywood garbage.  The movie started out with some promise, then quickly degenerated into a typical violence-mixed-with-funny-one-liners-movie, which has been done at least 7.9 million times before.I actually walked out before it ended, because I knew what would happen. Aren't people getting SICK of seeing movies that you can predict the ending to, and that insult your intelligence?Unlike most people, I don't turn off my brain when I go into the theater. Hollywood will keep recycling the same plot and action scenes because people keep paying to see it.",The Mummy

333,Brad2002,Fun movie,9,8 September 2002,"This movie is not deep and the characters are cartoon like, but still it's a lot of fun. Let's face it, this is a horror/adventure movie, which are seldom thought of as great movies. The movie is loosely based on the original with Boris Carloff ( which I have not seen ). The plot revolves around a high priest named Imhotep, who, 2000 years ago, had an affair with the Pharoah's wife and, upon being caught, Imhotep and the Pharoah's wife kill the Pharoah. Imhotep escapes and the Pharoah's wife kills herself thinking that Imhotep will revive her. He tries to do just that but is interrupted by Pharoah's henchmen who mummify Imhotep and bury him alive. 2000 years later, a band of fortune hunters stumble upon the crypt and accidentally bring the mummy back to life. The rest of the movie deals with trying to destroy the mummy before he fully regenerates and completes his plan to revive the Pharoah's wife.The movie features spectacular special effects and a surprisingly good performance from Brendan Fraser as an Indiana Jones type adventurer. In fact, if you liked the Indiana Jones movies, you'll love this movie also. Again, don't look for any deep themes or rounded characters - you won't find them in this movie, but you will find lots of fun and high adventure in this movie.",The Mummy
334,ssaftler,A movie in search of a genre.,8,31 May 1999,"This was equal parts horror flick and a Indy Jones sendup! Though it had it's gruesome parts (the ladies hid their eyes), there were some downright hilarious bits as well. Brendan Fraser surprised me, as I perceived him as a Paulie Shore-type non-actor.",The Mummy
335,Hanichi,A fairly fun movie that doesn't know what it wants to be.,7,18 May 1999,"The Mummy is a passable attempt at a rollicking fantasy adventure. However, the film could have been much more.  The acting is average, although Brendan Fraser does surprisingly well as the roguish hero.  The plot is straightforward, and the action keeps up throughout the film.  But there is something missing from this film.  Some of the action is quite gruesome, as if the filmmakers were taking a stab at true horror.  However, the scenes seem out of place with most of the rest of the film.  One never really gets any feeling of deep supernatural evil from the bad guys, so when they do horrible things it just seems like cheap thrills.  Yet the film is not really funny enough to match the standard set by Indiana Jones.  Overall, an enjoyable film, but destined for the dust bin of film history.",The Mummy
336,MrPink08,The Mummy...Dig it!,10,21 August 2008,"Let's face it, not too many people remember the 1932 film The Mummy very well. But its 1999 remake is an Egyptian thrill ride complete with explosions, flesh eating scarabs, Brendan Fraser, desert people, plagues, Rachel Weiez, and, of course, a cool mummy. The movie assumes you have an imagination (I do obviously) and is nothing but a fun time.Brendan Fraser stars as Rick O'Connell, who will remind people of Indiana Jones, but more badass. Fraser portrays Rick as a wise-cracking American who is searching for treasure beneath the sands of an ancient Egyptian city. He is also escorting Evy (Weiez), a nerdy but pretty British librarian, and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), who, like Rick, is interested in striking gold. Trouble starts when Evy accidentally awakes Ihmotep (Arnold Vosloo), a former priest of a Pharoah that was mummified alive for murdering the said Pharaoh, after having an affair with his mistress (Patricia Velazquez). Things go from bad to worse when Rick's ""buddy"" Bennie (Kevin J O'Connor) sides with Ihmotep in exchange for gold. Joining the battle to kill the mummy is the leader of a desert people tribe (Oded Fehr) who warned the party in vain to leave the city or die.The film is not only a great action movie, but it can also be considered a comedy. Fraser and Hannah frequently crack out classic one liners such as Fraser's ""If I don't make it outta here, don't put me down for mummification"" and Hannah simply showing disgust when a group of Americans are seen having fun when the desert people attack. O'Connor is funny as the bumbling Benny, and Weiez simply works her magic on Fraser. These two have some great on screen chemistry. Fehr is awesome as a gun shooting desert guy. And while the mummy is a bit whiney, Vosloo does a good job with part anyway.An excellent film. A perfect 10, and I definitely recommend the film's sequels as well.",The Mummy
337,damienmassart,Looks like a two hours demo of Tomb Raider mixed with Prince of Persiah,5,17 December 2018,"I don't understand all those good reviews. The Mummy is nothing but a poor Indiana Jones-like movie with bad story, poor acting, and awful videogame aesthetic. There is nothing in this movie that has not alteady been seen.

We went to go see Phantom Menace or something, and we were just a bit late. Rather than drive home, we were pleasantly surprised by the Mummy. Brendan Fraser had me quoting some of his lines for the next 2 weeks.If you go see this movie for a dose of Egyptology or archaeology, dont bother. They got so many things wrong, it was funny.  If you're going to see it for an action movie with a bit of romance, then you will be pleasantly surprised.I was also surprised by John Hannah's performance.

A distinctly juvenile approach definitely ruins this for fans of horror movies. What is left is just an average adventure film. Excellent Jerry Goldsmith score, though. The state-of-the-art sound mix and special effects make it enjoyable for Dolby Surround addicts and sfx fans.",The Mummy
342,Sciurus,Pretty good,7,8 May 1999,"Overall, it was pretty good.  It was a little cheesy in a some spots, but I think that having it just a tad on the campy side will actually endear it to viewers.  Brendan Fraser played the heroic stereotype to perfection and the villain was remarkable.  Some of the other characters seemed not to be well-defined, but they all played their roles in the overall flick well. It's not the best movie that will be out this summer (probably), but it is definitely worth seeing either now or if you can't get into Star Wars.",The Mummy
343,jaybee-3,Fun flick,8,28 May 1999,"A horror/action flick that is always moving. Great fun. Not really a remake of 1932 classic as it is a different kind of film. Good cast, solid script and direction, and fine musical score. And the effects are dazzling!",The Mummy
344,Lil'Girl,Entertaining Silliness,8,20 June 1999,"I suspect that nobody is supposed to take this film seriously as the film itself is suggestively tongue-in-cheek. If it had been a straight horror flick, I don't think I would have given it a second thought but as some reviewers indicated that the film was more of an adventure film a la Indiana Jones, I went along for the ride.The Mummy has the feel of an old B-movie but certainly with a much bigger budget and more spectacular special effects. The introduction, which is silliness itself, contains some stiff, cheesy acting and narration, making the way for a whole range of comedic moments. The result is pure entertainment mixed with absurdity.Particular credit must go to its cast, who looked like they were enjoying themselves during this rollercoaster ride: Brendan Fraser, with his goofy good-looks, was a delight, battling with mortal and undead villains. Rachel Weisz, was having fun looking like she was an expert in Egyptology and of course, John Hannah as her brother, showing uncanny timing for one liners.I confess I had a good laugh out of this. I don't think anybody seriously thinks they're getting a history lesson out of this. If they do, well, they're in for a disappointment. Ultimately, the association with Indiana Jones is fairly minimal. The Mummy is first and foremost an adventure film exploiting bits and pieces of known history as it sees fit.(A word on special effects in general: With the release of Star Wars, the Matrix and the Mummy, many have criticised the overemphasis of special effects above human actors and good storytelling. I think it is important to see special effects as much an art and a craft as any other forms of film making. Special effects are tools at the film maker's disposal and to be used according to how they would like to present their vision of something beyond the ordinary. There must be a place for all types of film making without this kind of constant barrage of censure of blockbusters. Each film should be judged on its merits - ie, the degree of success it attains in its execution. Comparing Her Majesty, Mrs Brown with something like The Mummy would be like putting apples and oranges on the same footing. This talk about High Culture vs Popular Culture has gone on for more than a hundred years and there doesn't look to be any resolution in sight. Incidentally, Shakespeare and Dickens were not elevated to their lofty status until after their time.)",The Mummy
345,EYEboy,What--no hip-hop soundtrack?,3,7 June 1999,"Thank you, Hollywood, for insulting my intelligence once again. Not that I expect the subtleties of Shakespeare from a horror movie rehash; but, in today's Hollywood, while an insultingly stupid script and walking-cigar-store-Indian acting is expected.The new MUMMY is probably no worse than a lot of Hollywood action fare out there now; what's amazing is that people get paid to make this swill. Even more insulting is that the original was such a classic, and while this is certainly no remake, it is little more than a computer game with a bigger budget (and minus the interactivity). It'll be more than two years before I waste this much of my precious time and money",The Mummy

348,humpback,best cliffhanger in a long time,9,18 March 2003,"Is this shakespearian plotting and epical choices ? Not really... Is this Academy-Award worthy deep thought method-acting, drama and dialogue ? Ahem, not really either. Interesting because of its correct portraying of ancient Eqyptian culture and life ? HardlyBut - what this IS, is pure, undiluted, fast paced and witty adventure cinema at its best. Leave real world sensibilities and belief in established facts at the door, please, lean back and enjoy ! ""The Mummy"" is a pure cliffhanger movie (in the Indiana Jones tradition, but definitely not a cheap rip off a la ""Quartermain"" ), with mystic mumbling, firefights, beautiful women, terrible curses and pretty nice places to venture through ( many of these thanks to spotless CGI ), with an ancient and cursed mummy being accidentally reawakened in the 1920ies by a crew of slightly careless, if amusing archaeologist/tomb-robbers - who now have to put the bunny back into the box, or rather the mummy back into the sacrophagus.
Great panoramic shots and landscapes (making you want to jump into the next flight to Egypt) , nice - fast but not breathless - editing and a moody soundtrack provide an excellent setting. The CGI effects on the walking corpse and its special tricks are pretty decent, especially for a late 1990ies flick.The cast of (among others ) Brendan Frazer, Rachel Weisz (simply beyond comparison ), John Hannah and more or less mummified Arnold Vosloo seemed to have had a blast of a time, especially with the bantering dialogue ( simply check the memorable quotes section  ) as well as personal interaction  and immersing themselves into the setting.And despite this being a ""monster-horror"" movie by default, the ""Mummy"" actually travels far more on the power of it's verbal sparring, true situational comedy and rather smart allusions to other genre favourites (like someone uttering ""Bugs ? I hate bugs !"" while rappelling down into an ancient Eqyptian ruin... ) then on it's appeal as a ""shock-horror"" flick scaring the audience witless. Call it a cliffhanger with moments of horror ( no gore, though, but some frightening concepts ) and some suspense - or better call it THE cliffhanger - IMHO this has yet to be surpassed in this genre ( yes, including IMHO the Indiana Jones triology ).worth every cent - unless you wanted to spend the evening in miserable brooding",The Mummy
349,roberjruiz,Why does Hollywood like buffoons so much?,4,17 January 2010,"One feature of many modern action films that I dislike a lot, specially in Hollywood films, is that they always put a buffoon (or several) in their films (Fortunately there are films like Syriana or Babel). In ""Episode I"" it war Jar Jar Binx. In the mummy it was John Hannah (And Brendan Fraser sometimes). I have nothing against a bit of humor, but you should know where and when to make use of that humor unless you want to break the drama and the action atmosphere. Specially when you use childish humor.I found this film to be a really bad one. Very good special effects, very spectacular, and I have to admit it was entertaining, but I would eliminate some of the characters, like Jonathan Carnahan. Sorry if I think that clowns are better for the circus than for action films.The only really good thing of the film is Rachel Weisz, which is really impressive (And I am not talking about the acting)",The Mummy

I thought the story was fun and fantastic with great dialogue by all the main characters and great action scenes that make you root for the good guys. Historically it may not be totally accurate (I see posts about the Plagues) but this movie didn't have a disclaimer stating 'this film is based on historical or biblical fact'.

I rather compare this movie more towards ""Army of Darkness,"" but less filling and over the top.

But the events play out with plenty of action, danger, and pretty well timed comedy.The cast is too notch, Brendan Fraiser at his height, personally I thought he would have been the next Indiana Jones. RACHEL Wisez was great and adorable. I've always liked Arnold Vosloo as an actor. And this movie introduced me to Oded Fher, who is also great.Over all a great popcorn movie.

356,Mike-469,Not Worth Your Effort,4,13 May 1999,"Overall, I was disappointed with this movie.  I know it's supposed to be mindless fun, but geez -- some parts were just stupid, even if you checked your brain at the door!  For example, after Rick and Evelyn are confronted for the first time by the giant, horrible mummy, Rick shoots at him a couple of times, and then runs out of the building.  Outside, when they are asked by others about the mummy inside, Rick just matter-of-factly goes, ""Oh, I took care of him.""  What??  Come on!  You'd think they'd at least run out panting or scared or something.  Another example: the whole group of characters spends a good portion of the beginning of the film on their way to Hamanaptra, an adventure in itself, as they lose all of their possessions, etc.  Finally, they get there, and you think that most of the movie is going to take place in this ancient scary place, far from civilization.  But after the scene I first described, the next scene shows them suddenly in a nice hotel in Cairo!  There's no explanation of how they got out of Hamanaptra, away from the mummy and the bugs, etc.  These inconsistencies happen throughout the film.Also, the characters made too many wisecracks for my taste.  If you're going to put characters into implausible situations such as this, at *least* have them believe in what they're doing!  The wisecracks remind us of the weakness of the plot and prevent us from really getting into the movie.Overall, I would give this movie a 4 out of 10, if only for some exciting moments and good special effects.  But don't be fooled -- this is in no way the ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" of the 90's.",The Mummy
357,kulaboy,I'm insulted by this pathetic piece of poo,1,26 May 1999,"I wish I was bribed to this movie, because it wasn't worth admission. Every film cliche doesn't describe The Mummy. To even try and explain it's sad existence is tiring. Let me begin with the previews: they show the best parts! Yes the effects are nice, for the few minutes they really spend showing them. The rest of the film is filled with Brendan Fraser and a chick and Arabs making one-liners and mumbling non-sense. I felt like I had seen Stargate, Godzilla, Independance Day, Diehard 3, and the Matrix, all pulled into one un-inspired motion picture that didn't even try to use originality. I wish the screenwriter had at least read some of the dialogue they used from a P.C. script writing software because it's boring. I think audiences would have enjoyed cutting out the romance scenes and all the rest of the filler and just showed an hour and a half of the mummy killing people, I mean that's  why they make these types of generic recycled films after all. I would like to ask the reviewers who enjoy this film why they enjoyed this film, because you've seen this film dozens of times. Be it a lizard, an alien, a stereotypical foreign assasin, or a mummy, it's the same thing, over and over and every summer.

Also, there's this wacky curse that provides the opportunity for a mortal enemy to rise from the dead and have supreme power!?

It looks at times that  even the genre is completely different, the first one was an scary movie, this one is an adventure almost comedy movie. Both are rather good in their respective genre, but this new version I think is a lot richer with special effects and humor and a lot of extras that the first one didn't have.

The acting is played in a comedic style, which is OK because the story plays this aspect well. There is nothing wrong with this film per se, but issues that arise may come from a lack of development in the characters, both main and side. It also may be because of the extreme amount of death that never ends throughout the entire film, killing off everyone who was not a main character.

The movie shows the great Egypt full of mystique and myth. A very funny and campy movie however- but it still never loses any ground on the fun factor. There is some parts in the film in which you can dose off, but otherwise it is a good film to watch and it will stick you to the screen. Brendan Fraser is a good action hero- but I would've preferred other actors like Nicholas Brendon or Matthew Perry to fill in the role because frankly, Fraser looks goofy and silly during his cameos and action sequences- maybe the producers and directors wanted it that way. Out of four stars- I give it a 2 1/2",The Mummy
366,Pebble-2,Pointless,6,11 April 2002,"Yet another blockbuster wasting millions on special effects.  Plotless. Scriptless. Pointless.  There are some decent actors involved here but why they got involved is beyond me (well, other than money!).  John Hannah in particular is completely wasted.  I love film which is able to use technology to boggle the mind with impossibilities, but there has to be some underlying foundation in terms of plot, script and acting.",The Mummy
367,Raine-8,"Well,it was what i expected",8,7 May 1999,"This movie is bizarre,gross,and at times relatively funny.But i must say i enjoyed it! Upon entering the Egyptian temple of the damned and reading the book of the dead,a cursed mummy is awaken and plague is put upon humanity.As well,a bunch of Americans who opened a box get cursed to be sacrificed for this shredded corpse. After that is gets pretty silly,but i must say it gave me what i expected. Brendan Fraser gives the performance everyone expected as the strong,silly and debonaire Legionnaire.Go see it,it's good.",The Mummy
368,brianmellow,A waste of good special effects...,3,20 April 2000,"I remember seeing the previews for this movie, and never once was there any indication how silly it was.  The previews indicated only the promise of great special effects and a good horror movie.  There was something about what people were saying (or not saying) that made me wait.  Now I know what it was.  This version of The Mummy didn't take itself seriously enough to be classified as a horror movie.  I just cannot understand why anyone would want to produce such fluff when it could have been so much more.  The special effects were great, but they seemed completely out of place every time yet another moment of levity was introduced.The IMDB genre for The Mummy is Adventure/Action/Thriller/Horror.  This film takes itself so unseriously that it qualifies itself as none of those. Every great special effect and piece of cinematography is ruined by the silly dialogue.  This film could have been a classic, but instead it was ruined by its ridiculous tendency to insert a silly piece of slapstick or dialogue every chance it had.I suppose that is why I disliked this film so much.  It's not what the film was, it's what the film wasn't that I can't get over.  Had the cast been given a serious script, the mood of the film would have seemed right, and I could have truly gotten into it.  Instead, every time I even started to try to immerse myself, it got silly and ruined it for me.I cannot imagine why anyone I know would look forward to a sequel to this film.  It's possible to interject humour in any movie genre without ruining the overall mood and feel.  This film seemed to go out of its way to shoot itself in the foot every chance it got.",The Mummy

It's comedy, it's action, it's witty and silly mummy character that will blow your mind. This movie is one movie that you should put in your top five. I put both mummy films in.

Just as with Sommers' followup, the wonderful, hugely entertaining and cruelly underrated 'Van Helsing', this movie seems so unfairly destined to be relegated to cult status, as does star Brendan Fraser, . Our family adored it and still do, and as a reimagining of a classic for the modern audience, alongside 'Flash Gordon', it's a virtually perfect vehicle, delivering solid thrills, laughs galore, marvellous scenery and effects, action aplenty, hearty romance and, yes, heart. The casting is simply perfect, highlighted by the glowing chemistry between the two irresistible leads, both so ably assisted by the truly terrific supporting cast, performing a smart, witty and sincere screenplay that strikes a beautiful balance between the various elements of comedy, horror, mystery/thriller, adventure, romance and good old-fashioned camp. It's a romp, it's genre, it's ""derivative"", sure, but it still has that extra something special, and it's a heartfelt and soidly rendered tribute that inscribes itself convincingly into the canon and, on reflection, proves itself to be a classic of its kind. It must be hard heart indeed that does not love this film and will not recognise how hard all concerned tried to make this the best filmtney could make, and how well they succeeded. Critics may carp, but it's boffo box office is the proof of the pudding and for anyone not terminally jaded, this is and will remain a classic.",The Mummy
371,aro-2,Entertainment in the mildest of forms...,8,8 May 1999,"The story so far: Fraser and Weisz, together with some friends and a few rivals, visit the lost city of Hamunaptra in search of some buried treasure. Unfortunately, the city is also home to an ancient curse. They discover and revive Imhotep, a rather unfriendly corpse who, after being fully regenerated himself, plans to revive his lost love by sacrificing Weisz. What happens next? Well, if you've seen the Indiana Jones films then you know what to expect.If done right, this could've been a very frightening Horror film. Writer/Director Stephen Sommers proved with last years' ""Deep Rising"" that he could successfully combine Horror and Comedy to create a fun, intense, and sometimes scary Adventure film. The difference with ""The Mummy"" is that the accent is on the Comedy and I'm not talking about a mild accent, either. This time the entertaining one-liners only succeed in diffusing the suspense he might've created. Why? Because they come one after another, without any breaks, even when the situation would seem better suited to silence. The thing I loved about ""Deep Rising"" and the similarly toned ""Tremors"" is that not only did they know when to keep the comedy coming, they also knew when to shut up. No such luck here. Instead of a fast paced monster movie we get the equivilent in the children's category; toned down violence and a few minor scares. This isn't the type of film I expected from the director who, just last year, had me on the edge of my seat while watching Treat Williams and Famke Janssen race through a flooded cruise ship on a waverunner mere meters ahead of a cluster of angry tentacles.In closing, let me say that ""The Mummy"" wasn't the worst film. The one-liners were funny and I was certainly never bored, but this is a film that will appeal more to the preteen, early teen age groups. It reminds one of the days when parents didn't need to be quite so concerned about the films their children were watching. A Horror film for the young, if you will.",The Mummy

I grew up on these watching Shock Theatre on TV and watching Vincent Price movies. But alas to the 90's when movies are made to attract the most cash which compromises everythingI have seen this movie many times and done much better ala Indiana Jones series.  The script and dialogue was really very poor, some good visual efects that got wasted by making the movie tongue and cheek- oh how cute.The best part of the movie was the opening shot which showed me the grander of how Egypt may have looked.What kept me half interested in this pretty dreadful and know what is going to happen next was watching Evelyn.

373,Bronis,The Hands-Down Worst Film of the 1990's,1,7 July 1999,"""The Mummy"" is the worst film of the 1990's... PERIOD.  I have never witnessed a more vile waste of talent and money than this absolutely hideous piece of crap.  The previews made it appear creepy and supernatural, but as the lights dimmed and the movie began, I realized things were taking a turn for the worst. I actually dragged friends along with me because I thought the film would be a prime slice of big-budget Hollywood horror.  Yet the film is so tongue-in-cheek and played for laughs that it completely alienated me as a viewer.The special effects are decent, but the 1930's version was damn creepier with a budget of probably 1/100th what this one cost. The story of ""The Mummy"" is gothic: it deals with undying love and revenge. These two ideas that are callously thrown aside for as many silly action sequences as they can squeeze in.  The acting is too damn campy, which began to annoy me, say, fifteen minutes into the movie.  The racial stereotypes are downright insulting, while usually solid actors Brendan Fraser, John Hannah, and Rachel Weisz are completely wasted.The best thing that happened in this movie is when the credits went on at the end.  And boy, did I have apologizing to do to my friends.Now I don't like dissecting films at all; I usually take them as pieces of pure entertainment.  But this one-- BY GOD-- almost made me lose all hope in Hollywood's ability to thrill an audience.  Universal Pictures, you should be ashamed of yourselves. And there's talk of a sequel.... Now that's scary!",The Mummy

The only reason the silly plot is just about bearable is the funny aspect of this horror comedy. But let's face it. The stars in this movie are the special effects done by ILM. So if we add up: 10 for the effects, 0 for historical accuracy (as in how America imagines the egypts might have lived, minus 10 for Star Gate in this category...), 5 for the plot and 7 for the actors.Just found out they are doing a sequel.

I was not disappointed. Up to date special effects coupled with a good story and great actors is excellent (and rare). Brendon Fraser is a good actor, and his character is quite different from his last film (George of the jungle). Rachael Weiz does more than just scream (a big improvement on the old classics), she is excellent. John Hannah - well i was a little disappointed in his part. His acting was very good, but i expected to see more of him,especially after watching the whole of the TV series ""McCallum"" in which he is the lead actor (which everyone should watch (10/10)). Arnold Vosloo - what can i say, this guy is great. Without his ""presence"" on screen, this film would have been average. With it this film in monumental, definately one for my collection.

Somebody's idea of a consolation prize???The special effects were okay but, hey, when aren't they, these days (at that price, anyway!), which leaves us with a plot full of holes, very average acting, a few nice desert scenes and the sort of toss-off one-liners that are credible coming from a character (and actor -- Harrison Ford) we believe to be tough as nails despite real fear, but not credible from Fraser's character.Not a waste of time if you've got time to kill (I don't) or kids who will believe this movie is scary.Rating = 6 of 10.P.

383,Jason-38,The video game as cinema equals a bad movie and boredom.,3,7 October 1999,"It's difficult to hate THE MUMMY, it's just impossible to respect it. You can't damn it out of hand, like Francis Coppola's vulgarization of DRACULA (formally titled BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA for some reason that escapes the understanding of people who have actually read the book). THE MUMMY does not come from a consistent literary source. So, you can't accuse it of purporting to be something that it's not. If you prefer the 1932 Karloff/Karl Freund Mummy or 1959 Hammer version with Cushing/Lee/Terence Fisher, then it's simply a matter of taste. You can't argue taste.The problem is that this movie bearing the same title leaves a very bad taste. It insults its audience by playing to the lowest common denominator. The script seems to be the work of many hands. That might account for the many inconsistencies in story telling logic. The style (if that is the word) of the acting and directing is basically TV sit-com.The special effects are much too obviously CGI. In their own way, they are just as artificial as the special effects of earlier generations that utilized optical printing with traveling mattes (with obvious matte lines) and/or rear projection. The problem is that our eyes become educated over time. The stage illusionist's trick that dazzled us as small children seems hopelessly coy to us a adults. The same thing is true of some of the techniques that ILM has developed over the past 20-odd years. Whatever film stock they choose, pixels look like pixels.Ultimately, special effects are no substitute story telling with a consistent point of view and characters who involve us emotionally. THE MATRIX, another movie that is basically a video game, does have a point of view; characters with at least some emotional life; and a unified approach to expressing a reasonably consistent point of view. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT makes up for what it lacks in production values with intensity; an interesting point of view; and even a certain degree of novelty. THE SIXTH SENSE gains its power by being first and foremost a story about human beings.The makers of THE MUMMY have no real idea of what they want to accomplish, hence the kitchen sink approach to story telling. It's anything for a cheap thrill. The end result is just plain cheap, despite the budget. Turning this into third rate Indiana Jones was a no brainer for the film makers, not that they have exhibited much in the ways of brains. For instance, anyone who has actually read the Book of Exodus (all right, or seen DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS) knows that the plagues of Egypt were inflicted by the Hebrew God. Therefore, it follows logically that they cannot be unleashed by the gods of ancient Egypt. Not that logic, taste, or intelligence ever mattered to the people who unleashed this mess.Without a script that has a shred of human feeling, there isn't much for the actors to do but react to ""blue screen."" The result is just plain embarrassing. To use that tired old film school expression, didn't the film makers ever seriously consider giving the characters an ""arc.""A word to Brendan Fraser, if you happen to be reading: You have been blessed with a career that is granted to very few young actors in any era. You possess a very rare combination of gifts. You are the best farceur/leading man to emerge in films since Kevin Kline & Cary Grant. You are a solid dramatic actor, as proven in SCHOOL TIES and GODS & MONSTERS. You are potentially the best action movie hero of the New Millennium. You have the golden opportunity to work as long as you want to work. Just please, use your gifts and your apparent intelligence with keener judgment in future. It could be a very bright one.By then, this dismal affair will just be a dim memory of youthful indiscretion.To anyone who hasn't actually seen this mediocrity: If you are desperate to find some way to waste two hours of your life, believe me, there a much better ways to do it.",The Mummy

Trying to treat this film seriously is not possible with the humor that is spiced throughout the film and with the campy computer graphic effects that are done on some of the lesser skeletons and mummies running around.  For once, the computer graphics are not overblown to ruin the movie's purpose.  If The Mummy can be seen as a return to the style of the cheap B-movies, with the dimensionality of the characters and the simple plot, the cg effects are used tactfully to give The Mummy a B-movie feel.",The Mummy

He hits all the right notes and is a pleasure to watch. Rachel Wise could have been annoying, but her sweet smile and rich accent won me over.Overall, this is a revisit to the ""Desert-Adventure"" film. It doesn't rank with the best of them, but that's besides the point. It's always entertaining and it left a grin on my face.

It is so entertaining from start to finish. I've watched it over 10 times and still enjoy it. Brendan Fraser's Rick O'Connell is a perfect movie protagonist who is funny, charming, brave, sassy, and can do pretty much everything. So when he fights the mummies with his bare hands, it is believable. Rachel Weisz as Evy is also a perfect match for him. She is equally funny, charming and smart. They both have amazing chemistry on screen.Now the actual Mummy, priest Imhotep played by Arnold Vosloo is a strong movie villain. He has scary, intimidating presence on screen and the director did a great job with his transformation and how it builds tension as we get close to the climax of the movie.Other supporting cast is equally amazing and add to the story.

395,Adrian-34,The pros and cons of it,10,7 April 2000,"Not since Boris Karloff has the mummy enjoyed such life.  The film is well written, directed and excellently cast.  Though I do have a few minor complaints they really did not inhibit, limit or damage the enjoyment of the film nor it's storyline for me.One of the few short-comings in my opinion is Brendan Frasier's character. He seemed to be lacking a bit but I do not feel that this was due to Mr. Frasier's acting but instead due to the writing.  I think the character could have been a little more well rounded.  I would have liked to have seen bit more to his character and perhaps more into some of the other character's as well.  A little more depth would have made the film a lot more intriguing.  My only other complaint is regarding the mummy's ""bride."" When her character is introduced we see a powerful, strong and potent woman capable of anything for her passion.  However, she seems lacking after her several thousand year slumber in comparison to her lover.  She seems almost desperate, whereas I expected her to be of a more determined demeanor.Otherwise the film is a superior story about the ancient horror monster, the mummy.  I was very pleased to see a film that had such magnificent effects that actually had a well rounded story.  Too often the effects, when of such quality, are the body of the film and the story is sacrificed.  Not so in this film.  The story is solid enough that the effects do not out weigh the story but serve to enhance it.  Though the obvious omnipotence of the mummy seems to destroy the credibility of the ending.  All in all, the film is a great sure to be one of the finest, modern horror classics since Bram Stoker's Dracula.  If you are like me, not a mummy fan, I highly recommend that you give this film a try.  It is likely to change your perspective as it did mine.",The Mummy
396,Walter Gamble,"Not that bad, dumb and crap afterall",6,21 June 2001,"When it came to the Mummy I did one of the most annoying, stupid and pretentious things possible, that is I saw the preview, listened to most the critics, and got on my high horse and refused to go see it, I made a mistake. Firstly though, on my defense, that was a pretty awful preview, but still I got into believing that the movie was a load of crap without even seeing it, and I owe all the mummy fans out there an apology for how I criticised the movie for no good or fair reason. But, anyway, with that out of the way I also think I did myself a favour because I had gotten my expectations of the film so low, that when it turned out to be quite enjoyable,quick and funny I was so pleasantly surprised it made go right out and see the sequel, which too beat my expectations. So maybe now I'll have to give all films a shot, except for Tomb Raider and Pearl Harbor that is.",The Mummy
397,ricsim78,One of my all time favorite movies,10,1 January 2008,"First off, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but most of the low ratings I am seeing are criticizing ""The Mummy"" because of it's ""weak plot"" or someone even said that this movie could have been written by the person's dog!Does anyone realize that there is different movie genres? If you go to see ""The Mummy"" and expect to see ""The Departed"", ""The Godfather"", or ""Shawshank Redemption"" then yes, of course you will be disappointed. This is not a drama, it's an action/adventure movie! Everyone has commented on the fun of this movie, that is what this movie is all about! Personally, I think the story is very good, and interesting. There is a lot to like here: it has elements of action, adventure, comedy, fantasy, mythology, horror, and tells a pretty well made tale (seriously, how many movies manage to pull all of these things off? And pull them off well!). And, it manages to do all of this in style, with amazing special effects and action sequences. No, it's not perfect (what movie is?) but this movie kills most movies in the same genre! I have never seen a movie that can contain so many different elements while still being coherent. This movie is a technical marvel is many aspects!Rachel Weisz is great and looks beautiful as well playing as Evelyn. Yes, she is something like a ""typical damsel in distress"", but she brings humor, intelligence, and a strong will to the part. It's hard to integrate so many qualities into a believable character, but she does it well.Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell: After seeing him in so many goofy movies, playing an equally goofy character, I thought he was always going to be cast in lame movies such as ""Encino Man"" and ""Monkeybones"". He was the reason why I had doubts I would like the movie because I could not picture him being more than a one-dimensional actor (able to pull goofy-charismatic off only). Not only does he act the part with stride, but he nails every aspect of his character: He is cool, yet has humor and he really surprised me with how much depth he can add to a role that really doesn't need it! Rick O'Connell wields his dual guns with flair, and I will never doubt Fraser again! I just hope they keep him utilized more and more like this. I was really impressed with him most because he surpassed all expectations!Everyone else did their parts extremely well, they always stay in character, and add to the elements of the story. This movie has a lot to offer, and lots of different ways to get your interest, especially if the Ancient Egyptian mythology fascinates you. This movie does have elements of horror: it will most likely scare younger kids more than adults, but putting yourself in the characters places you would be quite afraid. Imhotep is very scary, mostly because of all the different abilities he possesses, as well as forms he can take. I could not recommend this movie enough, especially if you have a HDTV and have the High Definition version, you will be blown away! Just don't expect a character driven drama, you're not looking for that with this either!",The Mummy

Aside from the fact that this film and Raiders of the Lost Ark took place in Egypt, there is little comparison of the characters.  Ford played an intelligent character while Fraser plays an almost juvenile one.The kids will probably love this movie, though I found that there were probably a few parts unsuitable for your average 10 year old.",The Mummy

It's really not, and if you expect it to be a straight remake of the original film you'll be equally confused.Another reviewer here on IMDB mentioned ""Big Trouble in Little China"", and I think that comparison is right on the mark. It's hard to say yet whether this movie will become a cult-classic like ""Big Trouble"", but it is a very funny adventure movie with good acting, a few scary moments, and remarkable special effects.

Beautiful sets and vistas with great special effects that don't overpower what is just an old-fashioned American adventure only hollywood could provide.  Don't I sound cheesy or what; all I know is I can't wait for the sequel. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are just beautiful together, and Arnold Vosloo is one terrific mummy.

401,Blake_Petit,B-Movie script + A-Movie FX = GREAT MOVIE!,7,7 May 1999,"""The Mummy"" is great! Sommers took bits and pieces from all the classic monster movies (and some bits from more recent films,) mixed it in with a dash of Indiana Jones and turned out a movie that is just plain FUN. It's not a groundbreaking movie and it won't unseat ""Citizen Kane,"" but it sure as heck unseats 90% of the monster movies Hollywood has ever turned out. It's been so long since Universal did something of this caliber that I wanted to cheer throughout the movie. Fraser was great as O'Connell, a hero that felt more like Han Solo than anything else, and really proved his diversity as a actor. Likewise, Rachel Weiz had an incredibly cute ""bookish"" quality about her that made her absolutely PERFECT. She's that small-town librarian that doesn't realize how desirable she is and, while her and Fraser's story runs very predictably, since this is basically a resurrection of the classic monster movie, you shouldn't have a problem with it.  Go in, don't be afraid to laugh, don't be afraid to scream, just be prepared for a thrill ride that is well worth the price of admission.",The Mummy

I was not amused!",The Mummy

The use of tongue-in-cheek to stand-in for character and story development is the oldest trick in the trade mag. It seems to be the only trick the movie industry has left. ""The Mummy"" is full of inconsistencies within it's own set of rules, sound effects for no purpose, other than to make those audience members with Saran-Wrap for eardrums jump, without establishing the sonic environment.I could go on but it's Mother's Day and I have a phone call to make.

I mean sure The Mummy wasn't scary but to be honest with you there hasn't been any scary movies that have been made lately so get used it.  The special effects were great and funny and sometimes it would look like a cartoons but I think that is what I liked about it.  You have to have a great sense of humor to love this film.

It is an ultra-cool movie that contains a bit of horror, humour and adventure. When i was little, i used to watch this movie nearly every weekend, because i thought it was so great. Now, i watch it nowhere near as much but i still find it entertains me greatly. I found some confusion amongst the two moments where the scarabs relieve a man of his flesh in a matter of seconds, and where they say that scarabs eat people very slowly. The obscure fear of cats that the mummy has makes for an interesting twist,( in that they say nothing can harm the mummy, or whatever,) later explaining that cats are the defenders of the underworld. This is a great movie and anyone who hasn't seen it should see it immediately.",The Mummy

I mean 2 years in an Egyptian Prison, and coming out with the most immaculate teeth I  have ever seen.  Also the movie picks and chooses what they want from Egyptian folklore and history.Furthermore, I hear a lot of people say that this movie has incredible special effects and everyone is soooooo impressed.  Well, guess what I am not impressed at all.  I can tell where the special effects are, and I can tell you how they did that (Thank you very much Rowan University). The thing with special effects is that if you can tell that it's an effect, then it's not special enough.But if you are able to suspend your disbelief and like comedy/action/horror/Brendon Fraser films then you will love this film.

Good natured, with plenty here & there to make you smile & once the mummy is brought to life things really get going.For once there is actually a touch of comedy about Americans! Check out the battle on the Nile boat, where the priests try to stop the two expeditions from getting to Hamunaptra. John Hannah's line about the cowboys battling it out Western style, ""Oh, Americans!"" has to be a first for a US production & introduces a nice taste of irony, which was unexpected.Also take a look at the DVD for the deleted scenes, especially the ""I used to know, him"" line. Why was that cut given the comedy used elsewhere?
All in all, not a patch on The Matrix, but then, what is? Still worth a viewing any time though & strongly reccomended for a good night out.",The Mummy

Get rid of Brendan Fraser shouting at the mummy and don't emphasize the CGI effects, and it could have been much better.  From what I've heard, Clive Barker was originally asked to take part in this film, the screenwriting to be specific.  That would have been great.

This is a Mummy for the nineties, who can turn into a sandstorm and sucks the organs right out of his victims. All in all, this is a fun, entertaining movie. Brendan Fraser brings the right amount of charm and comedy to his role. Although not as good as the Indiana Jones pictures, it has their spirit>",The Mummy
414,karlito5,"Good, solid and most importantly FUN entertainment",8,11 January 2007,"The Mummy is truly one of those movies that you can watch again and again. The plot is pretty flimsy however the writers are well aware of this and although the film does not generate into a full blown spoof there is vibe all the way through the film that everyones 'in on the joke'. The Mummy's charm lies in that although it is light-hearted you're never left in a situation where you wouldn't be rooting for the hero.Meanwhile Brendan Fraser puts in a great performance as Rick O'Connell and proves that he is guy who can handle the demands of stunt and effects heavy film. Rachel Weisz is good too as the clumsy librarian Evelyn. The real stars though are the supporting actors. John Hannah is absolutely hilarious as Evelyn's brother Jonathan and manages to steel every scene he's in with a brilliant one-liner, in fareness though Weisz and Fraser seem aware of this and have no trouble reinforcing each punch-line's impact. Oded Fehr is great too as a descendant of the Phaoroah's bodyguard he too has some great lines and like the others maintains a degree of sincerity without ever taking himself too seriously.The effects are great too and there are some cracking set-pieces most notably the one on the steam boat and the opening battle at Hamunaptra. In all the action scenes though there is an emphasis on making it fun and not too brutal, this I think gives the film a more wide ranging appeal - even if it is let down slightly by the inevitable romance between Evelyn and Rick which is not done quite as well as the rest of the film although it still has humorous moments.Overall? Well worth two hours of your time if you have or haven't seen it - 8 out of ten.",The Mummy

He 'homaged' the Mummy films of old and many other horror classics in his 'Mummy' films and 'Van Helsing.' Van Helsing was good, the Mummy Returns was shite... but The Mummy was a classic.Not because it was original - hardly - but it didn't try to be more than it was, had time for a romance, great special effects, John Hannah (a brilliant actor) and Rachel Weisz (a fantastic and beautiful actress), Brendan Fraser doing Indiana Jones, amazing action sequences, good humor... and didn't have the snot-nosed kid from the sequel.But if there was one scene that truly pulled it away from 'Indiana Jones'-ripoff, it was the Museum of Antiquities scene, with the hoard of Imhotep-zombies attacks. This is more in the vein of horror films - but it works spectacularly here.7/10 - minus three stars because Arnold Vosloo isn't menacing enough as Imhotep, we don't see all of the Ten Plagues of Egypt (which are fascinating), and we don't see Beni die.",The Mummy
416,acamera,"See the promotional preview, the rest of the film adds little!",2,20 August 1999,"As is, sadly, too often the case, the promotional previews of this pic contained practically all that was worth watching. There are some lovely moments, nice effects, good sets, and you've seen all that once you've seen the 'come-on' sequences!There were special effects- tho' not much of an advance on Harryhausen's classics of nearly 20 years vintage, and there were some nice sets. The story itself is, of course, well known to cinema-goers thanks to the whole sequence of 'Mummy' features produced over half a century ago, but what is depressing is that a re-treaded story got such a tired treatment. Even copying what was done in the past, the atmosphere that was then evoked is entirely dissipated by a lack of vision: the film has no clear direction.'Half-hearted' is a key phrase for this movie, & 'confused' the key word. There is a half-hearted attempt to be sexy, but not too much (because, presumably, we don't want the teens barring from the cinema). There is a laughable attempt to be scary/shocking which just does not do the business. Talking of 'laughable', the attempts at humour in this are frequent and pitiful: more suited to a costume soap on afternoon TV than a movie anyone would want to see! (Some of the sequences on a boat on the Nile were like someone attempting to do a comedy western on the set of 'Showboat'!)Money has clearly been spent, some of the scenery and sets are impressive, and there are passages of 5-10 minutes which have much promise. Sadly, that promise is all you get.What a shame! Here is story so meaty and cinematically promising that I could certainly see why it merited (at least one) re-make. Love, damnation, resurrection, bloodshed, exotic locations and 2 historical time frames offer so many possibilities. So many wasted possibilities. Like 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' a few years before it, 'The Mummy' takes a gothic narrative with enormous possibilities and wastes it. What a pity! The waste is- arguably-  all the greater here because, whereas the early 'mummy' films work very well indeed, there has never yet been a satisfactory and faithful filmic adaptation of Dracula (which always strikes me as really odd, for I have never encountered a book more suited to- almost designed for- cinematic expression).Don't go see this.

Imhotep wants to revive his long dead love (by sacrificing Evelyn) and take over the world.So, it's up to Rick O'Connell and friends to rescue the girl, kill the bad guy and save the world!Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is super cool, with a bit of Jack Burton (Kurt Russell in ""Big Trouble in Little China""), John Hannah is extremely funny, and Rachel Weisz is brilliant and looked very nice wearing a veil.This is a great film.

420,alan_wyper,Cringeworthy Indiana Jones Rip-Off,2,13 February 2007,"""The Mummy"" is an embarrassing slapstick style rip-off of the Indiana Jones movies. It's not funny (though it thinks it is), it's not exciting, it's not dramatic, it's just willfully stupid.I'd summarise the plot for you, except that this would only serve to dignify the film by suggesting it actually has a story and characters worthy of the name. In fact there are only clichés and cringeworthy stereotypes, and to make matters worse the film-makers actually seem to glory in their total lack of originality or imagination. Every scene is presented with a condescendingly postmodern nudge-nudge, wink-wink, you've seen this one before haven't you, kind of attitude, as though by gaining audience recognition of the clichés and stereotypes this somehow makes them clever.Allegedly the action occurs in the 1920s, but actually the film scarcely even pretends to take its period setting seriously. This is not simply a matter of historical inaccuracies. The original Indiana Jones movies had plenty of those, not least in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" the mystery as to what the heck half the German army was doing in British occupied Egypt circa 1936. Yet despite such absurdities, these movies were still careful to recreate a period setting that did, however tenuously, ground them in a semblance of reality.""The Mummy"" in contrast is set in an unreal fantasy land, completely divorced from any actual time or place. Just about everything is computer generated, and it shows. I'm sure I can't be the only one who regards CGI as the emperor's new clothes. Fair enough, it can be genuinely effective when used subtly to enhance footage that has been shot in actual sets or locations. But once you start using it to create whole worlds it just winds up making everything look like a video game. Call me old-fashioned, but I always thought that the whole point of good special effects was that they should be seen and not noticed. If people come out of a movie commenting on how amazing the CGI effects were, then self-evidently they weren't amazing at all. They were rubbish, because everyone was aware of them. In the case of ""The Mummy"" the phoniness of the CGI only exacerbates the phoniness of the script.As for the acting, it was generally pretty bad, although given the script that was hardly surprising. The only ""character"" who stood out at all was John Hannah's, and that was for entirely negative reasons. I don't usually mind Hannah, but here his character approaches Jar Jar Binks levels of obnoxiousness. Frankly I just wanted to punch his face in every time he appeared on screen. Meanwhile, Rachel Weisz looked gorgeous as ever, but that was woefully insufficient compensation for two hours of crass, cynical, cretinous drivel, passing itself off as entertainment.",The Mummy

The basic answer on a negative critique on ""The Mummy"" seems to be: ""Hey, what did you expect? It's a fun movie."" It's not. It's bad filmmaking at it's worst. It's not entertaining - and I was looking for shallow entertainment. It's not funny - the jokes are lame and the scenes that should've been serious are jokes too (which are also lame). The script doesn't even try to present a coherent or consistent plot - it's just a series of badly written, acted and directed scenes, held together by plot holes. Three days before I've seen ""The Mummy"", I started reading William Goldman's ""Adventures in the Screen Trade"" and I think it gives a really good overview of the inner workings of the American film industry.

But still a fun movie to watch for its FX under no assumptions that it is nothing more another popcorn flick.Starts off in the ancient Egypt with exciting FX and visuals (the priestess -- whit-woo, aougah aougah, hubba hubba!) that explains that bad guy's problem. Then moves up to 1925 with a confusing war scene that started off without any reasonable reason. Up to this point the movie is still confusing. But afterwards, it goes on very well with a reasonable pace.Brendan Fraser is doing a surprisingly good job as the Han Solo type of hero. The English chick played by Rachel Weisz is also surprisingly good at performing her character, without being a plain female side-kick that usually portrayed in this kind of movie. While the rest of the characters are a mixed bag of stereotypes. E.g. Trigger happy American, smelly but evil and cunning Arabs etc.The FX are superb. There are some scenes that your eyes can't believe it's computer-generated (e.g. Fraser's fight with the priest mummies) but some of the time they are CG-noticeable. The FX helps creating the updated mummy character that is more than a slow walking pile of bandages.Finally, don't expect this to be a horror movie as it is not frightening enough (as it could be more frightening), expect it to be an Indiana Jones with great influence of your typical mindless popcorn-blockbuster and you will have a 2 hour of pure fun.

I am a fan of the original, mainly because of Boris Karloff's portrayal of Im-Ho-Tep, back from the dead to resurrect the woman he loved.  All this remake seemed to be was a bunch of silly special effects thrown together to catch a few of the pre-""Star Wars"" summer movie dollars.Well, it does have a lot of silly effects.  Unabashedly silly, and hilarious.  Not too mention the movie is exciting, engaging and all around a great action-adventure movie.Brendon Fraser is great as a two-gun American treasure hunter leading an expedition to the ancient City of the Dead in search of a golden book.  Of course, through the course of events, all hell breaks loose.  The story from that point, with some interesting diversions, follows the original rather closely, although with nowhere near the sexual tension.
Although a great monster for the movie, Im-Ho-Tep in the original was a well-drawn character.  Arnold Vosloo comes nowhere near the performance of Boris Karloff, and is in fact more like Gary Oldman's portrayal of Dracula in several cases.

It has some great action sequences, some fantastic humour, the characters are engaging and the potting is spot on. It keeps attention throughout whilst never dragging out for too long.

This is probably the best film the mas has done......2) Simon Crane - Stunt Co-ordinator. The last few years, Simon Crane has worked on the really BIG films of US & UK : GoldenEye; Saving Private Ryan; The Mummy; Titanic. IF you know that Mr. Crane is working with a project, then you know that the film will have GREAT stunt sequences.....3) Jerry Goldsmith - The Composer.

I expected a tongue-in-cheek, semi serious, ""Jewel of the Nile"" like semi parody of the Adventure-Action genre film.What I saw was a nod of the hat gesture flick that went on and on and on. My brother in law summed it up perfectly. if inadvertantly, when he said, ""It's not to long a movie. If youn undertand how movies are made. Movies have a begininning, a climax and an end."" That's exactly what this movie has. A start, a climax.Another start another climax.Still another start, another climax.After starting a 1/2 half bottle of a rather decent white wine when the movie began I was ""chilled"" when the wine ran out but the movie didn't.It kept going on from one salute to another. A salute to Indy Jones, a salute to Romancing the Stone, a salute to Ray Harryhousen (sp), a salute to Star Wars, a salute to Temple of Doom, a final salute to Romancing the Stone and a final salute to itself. Yada, yada, yada. Ok already. Yeah. We got the point.You're a COMEDY/action movie. So was ""Last Action Hero"". Put an end to it already. Please. Once is enough. A guess it comes down to the difference between fine art and flim-flam art. Real Art knows when/where to stop. Flim Flam keeeps going and going and going.

It was so cringesome and unfunny and crap that I'm straining to avoid sinking into a litany of expletives just thinking about it. I'm aghast at how willing so many people are to accept ho-hum special F/X as a substitute for acting / plot / dialogue etc. I'm thoroughly ashamed that my admission money will in some way serve to perpetuate the prevalence of this kind of brain-downsizing excrement.I really wanted the bad guy to win - to rescue his damsel and kill Fraser and his spastic mates, and then proceed to brutally torture the cast and crew and the rest of the idiot world who paid and pay for such wretched flicks.Brendan Fraser should be much more careful about so tarnishing his potentially great career with dreadful fare time and again. As for John Hannah, I know he's a great actor but if I met him on the road I'd have to avert my eyes for shame.

I especially like the character of Rick O'Connell played by Brendan Frasier. I felt he could continue with this character as an Indiana Jones type franchise. I think the next logical step would be to redo the tired and wornout Wolfman genre. There have been a lot of ""Werewolf"" movies but not a successful remake of the original with Lon Chaney Jr. I bought this movie on VHS and still got a kick out of it.

I found the action to be exciting and fresh, the visuals awe-inspiring and full of grandeur, and Brendan Fraser to be suprisingly well cast as the hero.  While this film is nothing new, it is one of the better movies of it's genre.  The good enough story-line is aided by great computer effects and solid acting.

Brendan Fraser shines in this role with enough of his usual goofiness to keep the film from bogging down and yet he makes the role his own with just the exact right touch of comic book hero.

445,prometheus1816,DOSEN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!!!,10,25 July 2001,"I first caught this movie on my pay-tv service. Having not been to the theatres in almost eight years I wish I had seen this one on the big screen. It deserves to be seen there not on a 28-inch television that lacks the ability to show the movies beautiful landscapes. The cast of Brendan Fraser, Rahel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, Kevin J. O'Connor, Jonathan Hyde, Erick Avari, Aharon Ipale, Patricia Velasquez, Tuc Watkins, Stephen Dunham, Corey Johnson, Omid Djalili and Bernard Fox are magnificent. I listed them all because I feel this movie wouldn't have worked without a single one of them. This movie worked not only because of them but because of Stephen Sommers' able direction and writing. From the moment it opens the audience is transformed to a world where the impossible is possible. I believed this movie. It had a heart at its centre and a truth far beyond anything that has been filmed in the genre of late. Boris Karloff fans and admirers of the original 1932 version will be disappointed, but please give this one a shot. It has all the elements of those old classics and more. Sommers has done his homework on this one replete  with all the Egyptian lore. I think though he excells in capturing the feel of the time and essence of flawed chracters. There isn't one character in this movie that isn't flawed and that is fresh. These days you have characters played by actors who aren't supposed to be flawed (Harrison Ford). You accept these idiosyncrasies as endearing traits and either root for them or boo them depending on the side you take. Particular attention should be paid to the music. Jerry Goldsmith scores a big one here. His lush love themes and expansive melodies (epecially the Caravan and the Camel Race) are reminiscent of Lawrence of Arabia. If I could give this one more than a ten star rating I would. All I can say is, I reccomend this movie highly. Don't come to it with pre-conceived prejudices from the bad reviews or other comments. View it with an open mind and heart. It is 2 hours and 5 minutes of the best damn action I've seen on film in a long time. Kudos to all involved!!!",The Mummy
446,LoveGoodFlicks,I voted nine because the average is so low..but would have voted 8,9,6 June 2006,I just saw this again on TV last night and thought I'd check IMDb.Why has this movie only got a 6.x rating? OK it's not an 8 movie but it's certainly worth a solid 7.2-7.3.Then I looked at the previous voting scores and as of this date (June 06) 46 of the top 1000 IMDb voters had only given this movie a score of 1 and the median for the top 1000 IMDb voters was only 5.5.Crikey you'd start to wonder if there were professional companies employed that 'load' the voting on IMDb? (I'm not suggesting for a moment that IMDb do though).The movie itself is a damn good Indiana Jones type romp...nice mix of action and some good comedic moments....it's definitely a top mark popcorn movie (i.e. not going to stretch your brain cells too much) and as I said earlier certainly worthy of a Solid 7.2-7.3 on IMDb in my opinion.I think IMDb is a great resource but have to wonder when I see stuff like this if the voting stats are getting manipulated by studios or other companies that have an interest sometimes.,The Mummy

This has to be his best movie not that he is known for a lot of things. I think pretty much this film series and Georgie of the Jungle. Anyway this movie is fun and a good time. Rachel Weisz is great in it and see still looks the same today. I have recently saw her in Oz and she hasn't change much. Way to go Rachel Weisz! Arnold Vosloo is an outstanding bad guy. He play the part to perfection. He also did a good job in the first GI Joe movie. I haven't seen the second movie yet. I am waiting to watch that on video just because the guy who directs the Step-up dance movies directed that one and I have a bad feeling about it just because of that fact. Anyway this movie was awesome. I love the American cowboys in that movie. I see so much of myself in them. I wonder if that is how the rest of the world views us American. If so then they're more or less right about us. Sadly. The effects in this movie are outstanding but that isn't what makes this movie so good.

Rachel Weisz is super hot as Evy, a librarian who awakens Imhotep, the mummy, and then has to stop him. She is captured by Imhotep in order to be sacrificed to bring his love back. Now it's up to Rick O'Connell, played by Brendan Fraser, to rescue her. With tons of action and a totally cool plot, this movie is a great edition to any movie collection. Fraser is awesome as O'Connell, who knows something is alive under the sand of Hamunaptra, City of The Dead, and then he has to stop the evil from spreading. He is a funny action hero, and he does his best work in this movie. Rachel Weisz does a super job. John Hannah plays her brother Johnathon, who is some of the comedic support. Kevin J.

When it comes to The Mummy, the answer is: YES. For sheer mindless entertainment, The Mummy will hold you for a while, but don't expect any return trips to this curse of a flick. Boris Karloff would be rolling in his tomb. Cheers to the great special effects, but I couldn't help but feel I was watching a giant comic. Cheesy one-liner jokes, not-so-subtle jabs at ""smelly"" Egyptians, and not enough dead corpses in bandages. The Mummy himself regenerates too quickly, I'd rather see him in continual decay throughout the film. Goofy love story subplot, and I'm talking about the ""living"" characters. Only thing that help my attention was the sexy bald Imhotep (The Mummy pre-embalming and post resurrection) in his loin cloths. The Mummy likes to open his mouth a lot in the movie, whether to release a swarm of flies or a plague of locusts; maybe he needs a check-up. Can't wait for the Saturday morning cartoon.",The Mummy

Brendan Fraser turned in a decent, if somewhat wooden performance, and things did have a tendency to follow the deux ex machina rule: When the plot got stuck, the answer dropped out of the sky on the heroes.

It was obvious to me that more time was spent on the special effects then on any other aspect of this film.

The same characters you've seen a million times, spewing the same tired dialogue you've heard a million times, in the same predictable situations you've seen a million times. And if thats not bad enough, the viewer is constantly being bombarded by cheesey computer effects that are too fake looking to be frightening (the scarab beetles in particular were very poorly done).

I don't care if the originals were supposed to be horror movies, it simply doesn't matter. Universal did not, I reapeat did not, want it to be a horror movie, they wouldn't have funded nearly 100 million dollars for a horror movie, they made it very clear it wasn't going to BE a horror movie. They did it for the toys, the special effects, and (Heaven forbid) ""turn-off-your-brain-fun"".

I don't go to a movie ready to attack it... sorry, just not me.  If I leave entertained, I'm happy.   There are some movies that stand out for me that I enjoy more, much more than the Mummy but those are for different reasons beyond just entertainment.  The Mummy was, entertainment. Get a grip people, this wasn't supposed to be Citizen Kane, The Godfather or anything else.  I hate to compare it to Star Wars but folks, the acting is FAR worse and TWICE as hokey, yet still a good movie right? You weren't supposed to stand up and cheer, you were supposed to see some cool effects, and get some giggles.  It's a ""fun"" movie,  yes they still make those, not every movie is supposed to move you, make you think, vie for public office, fight a war, or... gasp... shoot someone or even worse.. yes... SMOKE! (EGAD!) At any rate, see the movie again with an open mind and just enjoy it for what it is.  Corny, good natured, FUN. The plot is NOT supposed to be believable, its fantasy, its NOT supposed to be thought provoking its supposed to be CORNY.  Corny isn't a bad thing in this movie its a plot development. I don't pick apart Star Wars saying,  yaknow... there really couldn't be fire in space since.. or Hey Superman is flying and we all know people can't fly!  Superman was a good movie, right?

There have been many stories about mummys and egyptian tombs but none have come up to the standard of The Mummy. From the start the movie spins a tale of mystery with characters that are just that, characters. The movie never aims to be real world but is total escapism.

So how did Stephan Sommers go from the wonderful adventure/horror movie ""The Mummy"" to the terrible ""The Mummy Returns"" to the unwatchable ""Van Helsing?"" I have a theory: Everything was in perfect balance in the first half of ""The Mummy"". Branden Fraser, was the perfect adventurer, Rachel Weisz was the perfect bookish librarian who blossoms into an alluring dessert flower with just one costume change. (I thought veils were suppose to cover up beauty not enhance it). Casting in general was perfect. Take Oded Fehr, the chief guardian of the place with his intense looks and great baritone voice. You just knew women were going to pick up on his charisma. Best of all, a great feeling for the creepiness that was ancient Egypt. Last but not least, the best musical score from Jerry Goldsmith that makes everything jell. Then the movie took a wrong turn. It became more special effects and less great adventure storytelling. This was not a fatal mistake because of the great forward momentum of the story. Yet some of the creepiness was evaporating as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" type skeletons were taking over the story. Still, everything was so good, all was forgiven. What the director should have learned from that movie was that too many special effects and too little plot and character development were the wrong formula. So what do we get in ""The Mummy Returns"", 70% special effects to a weak story. Then in Van Helsing, its 90% special effect and no story anyone would care to follow. If he can make a great fun film like the Mummy, he has the talent to redeem himself.",The Mummy

If you are of the type who likes to see a simple action movie with cool effects and don't mind the occasional cliche scene, go see it, and enjoy. The special effects will knock you out.However, I am of the opinion that a movie should leave you with more than just a few humorous lines and special effects. A few years from now the special effects will look as pathetic to us as the CG in Toy Story does today. What will we think of this movie then?Stripped of its FX, the movie is not more than a standard Indiana Jones-style adventure, with a bit more gore and much less charm. It has recycled scenes and a _very_ standard plotline. The director tries to cover this up by a little self-humor, but I don't buy it. It's just ""deja-vous all over again"".Computer graphics have revolutionized the way movies are made today. Like all revolutions, we don't really know what the end effect will be.

I see a lot of comments on how fun this was... movie goer's have gotten much less sophisticated these days other than special effects.I came into this expecting a lesser Raiders of the Lost Ark... it sure was lesser. The narration at the beginning makes it look like a lot was left on the cutting room floor and Brendan Fraser's no Harrison Ford! More like Al Gore.The dialog was was a sad bit of script writing. I kept waiting for someone to break out laughing. There was no sense of horror... you know the kind where if a phone rang you'd jump two feet off your chair? This was more a comedy/melodrama with special effects. The effects were very good so if that is all that matters to you then go for it. I need more.Weisz, as Evelyn the librarian and amateur Egyptologist was something to look at for sure. I'll have to visit my local branch more often. :-) But she was given nothing script-wise and was an EXPERT on everything concerning Egypt and the Mummy. There was nothing she didn't know... a super-librarian.Even the music was poor and led to the non-horror feeling. All this movie has is special effects. The dead army of Imhotep looks great but they fall like bowling pins when confronted and still don't have the magic feeling of the Sinbad/Jason skeletons of the past.This may be a hit with 10 year old's (it sure is better than last year's Godzilla) but adults should hit another theatre for their money.Rating - 3 out of 10",The Mummy

Five minutes into this movie, I could tell the special effects would put the new star wars to shame.  And it did!  The effects alone were enough to make me want to see it again.  The characters were well played, and the humour was put in at the right times.  Some good stunts and fight scenes too!  Jackie Chan would like this movie. The sandstorm scene is out of this world.  When the plane dives behind the mountain, and the storm rises from behind, damn! To all those who canned this movie: come on, I have yet to see another movie this year, besides Tarzan, that I would really want to see again.  starwars was so abominable, that I won't even see the next one...

The plot was completely predictable: A mummy tries to take over the world while our heroes, a sexy librarian, her goofball brother, and a rugged ruffian have to kill the immortal beast.  It was obvious that the makers of this film started off trying to make this movie good and, upon realizing that the film would turn out awful, decided to act like it was supposed to be this way.  The only reason that you should go see this film is if you are wide awake, feeling boisterous, and want to make the whole theater feel stupid for paying to see such hodgepodge.""Oh no!

You can't help but cheer.First let me say, I never really liked ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" What is the body count in that movie? It's one long corpse generating, gore splattering, branding and bone crunching series of scenes in which Indy tosses bodies off cliffs, trucks, into propellers, flames, etc. etc. ending with the wrath of God impaling the Third Reich. Call this entertainment?This film is worlds better on all counts. Sides shift, everybody gets a chance to kick ass, heroes triumph, are defeated, but in the end, by the skin of their teeth, they defeat the baddy.If you want ""My Dinner With Andre"" (also out on DVD?) go see a stage play.

The special effects were good, better than I expected, and Brendan Fraser was a pleasant surprise in this type of role.  Having seen him in With Honours as a serious student, to see him in a 'cowboy' role was a fun change.  The slapstick humour was fun, and not too over the top.  And the violence was done tastefully, requiring the viewer to imagine what was happening to the victim.  Well worth viewing on the big screen!",The Mummy
477,Coolflic,What you see is what you get.,6,29 June 1999,"This is a good adventure film by it's self but doesn't compare with the Indiana Jones trilogy. The Egyptian props and set designs were superb and probably even more impressive than the real thing. The pace of the story, although well thought out, was hectic to especially cater for young/short attention spans and barely left time to create atmosphere or character depth. Brendan Fraser was surprisingly good in the lead role but we will have to wait a couple of decades to see if he compares to Harrison Ford. The role written for Rachel Weisz was not pc but I suppose nothing was in the 1920's. The fight scene with the mummies towards the end seemed reminiscent of the skeleton battle in 'Jason and the Argonauts, but with more humor. Overall what you would expect from Hollywood including all the latest special effects.  6/10",The Mummy

And they bot had good chemistry on the screen. The story is obviously bigger than the original or any of the ""Mummy"" movies of the past (including the comedies). The director and co-writer, Stephen Sommers does a very fine of utilizing special effects that work with the genre and the story. THis seem to be an area that he relishes an he delivers some wonderful sequences.The sets, the costumes ail work, as well as the beautiful the cinematography by Adrian Biddle.

An excellent cast and decent script gives an entertaining array of believable characters that enjoy some excellent on-screen chemistry, particularly between the characters portrayed by Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weiss. The locations/sets are well-chosen/designed and look very realistic, and input from real-life experts lends a pleasing reality to when the actors are speaking in ancient Egyptian. The plot is fairly straight-forward, but still contains enough suspense to keep you interested and it retains plenty of light-hearted humour to keep from getting too serious.

I'll admit that I went into this one with some trepidation as I don't usually go for modern ""horror"" movies but the special effects in the trailer just looked too good to pass up.Well, it is a good thing that there was more to this movie than cool special effects because all of the really good ones could be seen in the trailer. The movie was, however, anything but a disappointment.The best way to describe this movie would be to make comparisons to the Indiana Jones movies.  In fact, this could easily have been a continuation of that series.  The hero was very Indy-Like (with some dashes of Han Solo and the hero from Romancing the Stone) with a good dose of humor thrown into the Macho Hero act.  There is the beautiful damsel (actually the brains of the outfit), the incompetent tag along, and the mysterious band of strangers.  All in all, well cast and appropriately acted.There are some good action sequences, great light hearted banter, and no nudity or blood.  The deaths, although sometimes nasty, are bloodless. Most of the special effects budget seems to have been spent on the mummies themselves (pay close attention to how them in the later action sequences) but there are a few good ""biggies"" in the movie as well.If you are looking for hard core horror, this is not the movie for you.

The second is pure and simple cinematic grave-robbering, only not directed by GUS VAN SANT. No new ideas, no new experiences, good visual effects wasted in pathetic storyline and tedious characters. If it's a horror movie, it is not frightenning. If it's a adventure movie, it's not exciting. If it's a comedy, it's not funny. If it's dramatic, well, it is pathetic.

The director messed up the mix of humour and adventure. It must be that the humour was aimed at 12-year old boys, 'cause I was sometimes ashamed to watch their wooden efforts.

If we grade the handling of the subject and its commitment, regarding either Abbott and Costello or the Marx Bros Meet the Curse of the Pharoah at 1, to Indiana Jones at 10, this film comes in at about 4. I found myself disenchanted at the lack of any form of intellectual content, with minimal lip-service being paid to the scholarship in Egyptology. The characters are largely pantomime, with stereotypical roles and attitudes. Spoof-laden, most of the scenes are (I hope, intentionally) played for laughs, an especially irritating strategy which undermines all attempts to make any convincing characterisations - not that there are any genuine attempts, or characters, for that matter. The pace of the film is generally too fast, a feature which also contributes to its overall superficiality. Top marks for securing the services of Jerry Goldsmith, however.

I put these movies in my collection between Frankenstein for old horror movies and any of the living dead movies cuz... lets face it the mummy is dead! The CG in this movie for its time is splendid, the points when Imhotep's corpse jaw moves around on his face, turning flesh to rot and rot to flesh... that was brilliant. The sand storms caused by his travel and even the point when he tries to eat Fraser with a sand storm were well done. The blending between CG and mummy's in the final battles were spot on.

I'd much rather sit through a longer movie, as long as it's directed better than this one.The acting is not bad: Fraser, Weisz, and Hannah deliver, although the three Americans and O'Connor are all given characters filled with stereotypes, and Vosloo is not all that scary.Technically the movie is very good.  The cinematography is warm and wrapping, and the art direction beautifully and realistically sets the story in Egypt.  The visual effects and the makeup are astonishing, and with Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack, are by far the best things of the whole movie.What lacks here is a solid story line.  Virtually all the characters are forced to pronounce obvious or ridiculous lines from time to time, and the only good things are the occasional jokes thrown in the plot just to make the audience laugh and maybe forgive the lack of a better screenplay.The original was by far better than this one, and definitely scarier.This movie set an opening record, but it's worth to watch only if you've got nothing better to do, nothing better to see, and nowhere better to go.",The Mummy

Don't be put off, however, by the inevitable comparisons to the Indiana Jones movies (hardly an insult to any Hollywood actioner, anyway), as this is a marvellous way to while away two hours of anyone's time.Basically a big-budget makeover of those Forties Saturday morning serial adventures your parents always rave about, The Mummy doesn't have an original moment throughout  but it really doesn't matter. Director Sommers is no Spielberg, and Brendan Fraser is certainly no Harrison Ford; but the film careers along from scene to preposterous scene without stopping for breath. It's not until you've left the theatre with a stupid grin that you realise you've actually witnessed nothing new to the canon of adventure movies. The actors wisely allow the story to develop through big, brash effects, adopting instead the school play style of faintly embarrassed hamminess.Basically Indiana Jones meets Scooby Doo, with the story largely influenced by the latter.

It looks like the actors and the director also find that difficult. At least the expression on the Americans just before they were sucked dry didn't express much horror and panic.I cannot figure out whether this movie is intended as a horror movie or a bizarre comedy. It proved impossible to be both.The special effects are well done technically, although the dissolving flesh of the mummy doesn't look like a part of him, but more like - well computer graphics. I believe that special effects should be rather to subtle than to exaggerated as they are here. In fact i find the oldstyle double exposures etc. much more frightening (because they look dreamlike). On the other hand the sinking crashed aeroplane is hilarious.The movie also contains a lot of ""factual"" errors that annoys me slightly. Why would Egyptian soldiers - even mummified ones, wear the crown of Lower Egypt? That would be heresy. And how is it possible to see the pyramids of Giza from the city of Thebes/Luxor? Or do I mistake the pyramids? Did the old Egyptians really use such strange weapons? I have a vague feeling that some of the sculptures, reliefs etc. are slightly wrong. The Egyptian sets simply don't look Egyptian.And is a scarab really flesheating and is it so big (no).But anyway - if one does not take it seriously it is still worth seeing.

514,catmommie,Silly Fun,8,12 May 1999,"Citizen Kane it ain't, but if you're looking for good, silly, H. Rider Haggardesque fun, this is the film for you.  While it  hasn't replaced the Universal classic in my affections, let's face it, the venerable original creaks a little.  I mean,  Karloff's Imhotep only moves two feet per hour -- geez, how will I ever escape him?  Arnold Vosloo's Mummy is considerably more fleet, and frankly (from the dirty old lady's perspective) is pretty darned buff for a dead guy.  A modern affectation, sure, but I like the idea of a mummy with a great butt.Brendan Fraser looks good, has a fabulous voice, and a whole boatload of goofy charm.  Hey!  Call me shallow, but that's pretty much all I'm looking for in a screen idol.  John Hannah was acceptable, if not inspired, as the wastrel brother.  Rachel Weisz is gorgeous, and acquits herself well in the role of ""Heroine in an Adventure Film;""  i.e., she screams and gets rescued a lot.OK, I lie.  The modern ""Heroine in an Adventure Film"" is SPUNKY, screams, and gets rescued a lot.And as to Oded Fehr, who plays the mysterious desert guardian of the mummy's tomb (a role traditionally assayed by Welsh character actors) -- I and the rest of the ladies in my party indicated, through a series of incoherent grunts and some unattractive drooling, a strong desire to see much, much more of him.  And we mean that both literally and figuratively.  Powers that be, please take note.A couple of small caveats:  the bug quotient in this film is much higher than I usually tolerate.  It puts you right off your Milk Duds.  And where in the hell did those camels come from?So if you're in a mood for brainless entertainment, I recommend that you set your intellect on stun, rush to the nearest cineplex, buy the large popcorn (WITH butter), and settle in for a couple of hours of colorful, loud, over-the-top fun.Catmommie",The Mummy

Some of the special effects were pretty good - if you've seen the preview, you've seen them.The prejudicial stereotypes of Arabs were unpleasant.  They were depicted as stupid, smelly, uncouth, underhanded, etc.  One cannot imagine a major studio releasing stereotypes like this of blacks or Jews nowadays, but apparently Arabs are still fair game.I suspect the movie is being both helped and hurt by Matrix.  Matrix was so good with such incredible effects and a good story, that I was hoping such innovation had become standard - that the next big release would also be able to match it.

517,TVBob,"Fun ""Remake""",8,8 May 1999,"The Mummy is entertaining fare.  A few of the jokes (and there are plenty attempted here) might be a bit boorish (bookshelves in an austere museum knocking each other down domino-style), but enjoyable nonetheless. And the characters, while slightly one-dimensional and cartoonish, fit this story perfectly.Try to pay attention to the beginning of the story; there are some great little scenes where the ancient Egyptian high priest Imhotep (aka The Mummy) is caught in a naughty position with the Pharaoh's wife.  Some great costumes and set design are seen here and later in the movie when our 20th century adventurers come upon the tombs.  Kudos to the set designers and prop people and costumers and matte painters...beautiful stuff.Anyway, the bulk of the story involves a competition of sorts between a bunch of loud-mouthed Americans and a British brother-sister team (led by their pal Brendan Fraser), all trying to find the Egyptian City of the Dead, where lots of gold 'n stuff is to be found. One problem, though: the City of the Dead isn't supposed to be messed with, 'cause that's where Imhotep is buried.After a few twists 'n turns, they arrive, awaken bad old Imhotep, and the chase is on.  How to kill the soon-to-be-invincible Mummy?  To make matters worse, Imhotep has picked our British heroine out to be the sacrifice that will bring Pharaoh's wife back to life. Good horror/adventure stuff, eh?Anyway, the show is a lot of fun, doesn't take itself too seriously, and has some good laughs and great special effects (Industrial Light & Magic).  I gave it an 8.",The Mummy
518,AudreyH-Fan,The best movie of the year!,10,13 May 1999,The Mummy is one of the best films I have ever seen in the theatre!  It has non-stop thrills!  Brendan Frasier plays a heroic war veteran.  Racel Weisz plays a beautiful but clumsy egyptologist.  The movie is set in 1929.  The special effects are amazing!  Some of the scenes will gross you out!  I can guarantee that you WILL jump out of your seat a few times during this movie!,The Mummy
519,Filmgalning,Fun matinee but....,6,31 May 1999,"Ok, I liked this movie, a big budget matinee with great effects and sometimes funny dialog. There is one thing that bothers me though, the girl. She's supposed to be so smart and everything so why let her be smart in one scene and stupid like a donkey in the next? And why does she have to scream all the time? It got tiresome and you really hoped she would die and that's not a good thing to wish for for one of the main characters,is it?",The Mummy
520,Math Wiz,"Very suspenseful, high action",4,18 June 1999,"I think that ""The Mummy"" is a very good movie. It is very suspenseful and is packed full of action.

Overall, I think it had a very good story and I recommend it.",The Mummy
521,Jorgen-8,Not worth seeing,4,27 June 1999,"""The Mummy"" is an unfocused piece of work. Not knowing which genre to settle in, it turns from the purest action/adventure in  typical Indiana Jones-style to a hack'n slay-fest with ""Army of Darkness"" as the closest point of comparison. Unfortunately this is not a very successful attempt; Brendan Fraser is neither a Ford nor a Campbell, and Weisz doesn't add much spice to the screenplay  Hannah and O'Connor are fresh breaths of air but nothing more. Also, the special effects were, in my opinion, somewhat overrated and don't quite succeed in adding that special touch which a film of this orientation demands.

Humor, horror, adventure, history, romance, all spooned onto a very full plate that somehow manages to balance these elements and leave us satisfied.  With a rousing score and characters that seem to have leapt out of the broad-brush-stroked adventure novels of yesteryear, the movie spares no adventurous twist, no tongue-in-cheek movie reference, and no visual effect to bring the biggest, most absurd, most mummified actioner to the screen (and now, your home screen...).  Watch it with a bag of popcorn and a readiness to catch all the jokes as they bounce by (and for lovers of DVD director's commentary tracks, the interplay between Sommers and his long-time editor Bob Ducsay rivals any radio morning-show banter, and actually makes the film even funnier...). All in all, a worthwhile ride.",The Mummy
523,berht-2,Yuk! Don't buy and rent something else if possible. Definitely beyond Dead!,5,27 February 2001,"OK, Ok, ok...so my five year old kind of enjoyed it.  But that's about the mentality  of where the script, plot, special effects, and acting performances are at.  The DVD quality was even more disappointing. Coming off of Heat and Dark City, each with the highest quality video and sound I've seen and heard on a DVD (thanks to IMDb reviewers' comments), this DVD was close to very poor.  Focus seems to be a problem.  Many scenes loose clarity in background objects that blur and even with a calibrated high-resolution TV, colors were not crisp or fully displayed, remaining drab and subdued.  Sure, it is a dark movie, but either the proper equipment wasn't used or more likely it was just slapped together quickly to catch the dollar wave and no technical improvements were made in the production of the disk.  Even the dolby was poorly recorded.  Couldn't tell it was 5.1 at all. It sounded like the recordings were never mixed and improved in making the DVD sound as it was comes almost solely from front left, right and center speakers with a faint buzz in the rear speakers barely audible in some action scenes.  Beats me why this is rated so high.  I'm being generous with the 5.",The Mummy
524,Ankh-11,Failed in all categories but possibly special effects.,1,24 May 2000,"If the movie is supposed to be anything near a horror movie, one can safely conclude that this adaption of the classical Mummy-plot has lost most of what made the old Boris Karloff-version its depth and pathos: While the ""old"" mummy was driven by the search of his long-lost love, the modern mummy´s only driving force seems to be a never explained lust for destructive power in a non-specific, dull way which reduced this mummy to yet another of these dimensionless ""evils"" typically found in your average second-rate film. Some would perhaps argue that this new Mummy-film is, in fact, more of a comedy/adventure-film than a horror film. This is, in one way, probably true but the film falls short even in those categories. The obvious resemblance to the Indiana Jones-films only reminded about how much better those films handled things in terms of plots, characters, action sequences and all other aspects, while at the same time underlining how little character of its own The Mummy actually possesses! The jokes were in generally not really funny, the adventurous parts not really exciting and - as stated above - the horror-parts not horrifying. The only reason to still watch the film would probably be to check the special effects like the sand storm, which I suggest be done in front of a video (giving the otherwise bored viewer a chance to skip the less fascinating scenes ...).",The Mummy

528,matthewwalker66,Classic Adventure Film,9,18 March 2020,"It's a massive shame how underappreciated the Mummy is, considering the amount of aspects it balances and gets right. It only has a 60% on RT and only seems to have a small following, despite being an excellent action, adventure and monster films. I rewatched it recently, and only confirmed prior thoughts of greatness. Here some of the pros/takeaways I have:-The setting is perfectly realized: the movie does an incredible of taking the viewer to 1920s Egypt, a setting rarely used in film. The beautiful desert shots, egyptian-like score and specific period set pieces contribute and enhance the film in many ways. It's often just a joy to look at and listen to the film.
-It does a fantastic job with it's creatures/mythology. The story blends aspects of Egyptian mythology/history seamlessly, as it showcases various locations, gods, objects and characters. It is a lot easier to get into the movie with the excellent world design created here.
-The story is fresh and exciting.
-The actors/characters are excellent. The Mummy has an almost entirely unknown cast (Rachel Weisz being the only actor/actress to star in critically-applauded films) and yet nearly every performance in the film works in its own way. The two massive standouts are John Hannah as Jonathan, honestly in my opinion one of the best comic-relief side characters in movie history, and Arnold Vosloo as the Imhotep, an excellent villain with the perfect amount of humanity. Brendan Fraser is an excellent lead, Rachel Weisz is solid, and even most of the minor characters contribute to the film.",The Mummy

We'll cast, great actors. Love it. Simple as that. In the vein of Indiana Jones and that's high praise indeed.",The Mummy
530,Kittiko,The Curse of an Addicting Action Film.,10,27 May 2010,"The first time I saw 'The Mummy', I was terrified. Of course, I was only 9 years old then (and very much a chicken obviously). Now that I am 20 years old and have seen the film without a hint of terror, I'm very much glad I got over my childish fear of flesh-eating bugs and sat through this amazing movie's entire length. It's too good a film not to watch.The movie starts out in ancient Egyptian times, sometime around 2000 years B.C. Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is the trusted High Priest to Pharaoh Seti I, but he's got a thing for Seti's soon-to-be wife, Anck-Su-Namon (Patricia Velasquez). They have an affair behind the Pharaoh's back and plot to take over the rule with a devious, murderous ambition. When Anck kills herself after she and the High Priest brazenly kill Seti, Imhotep tries to resurrect his love, only to be captured by Pharaoh's watchdogs, the Med-jai. Imhotep is mummified alive, the victim of the dreaded Hom-Dai, and sealed up inside the base of an Anubis statue in Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead. Anyone who disturbs him risks releasing his wrath on the world.Flashforward to Cairo, Egypt in 1926, and we have librarian Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her booze-loving brother Jonathan (John Hannah). They happen upon a map that leads to the fabled Hamunaptra, which is hidden in a 'puzzle box' that Jonathan swipes off an unsuspecting American. This American is Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), an ex-legionnaire who has been locked up in a Cairo prison for 3 yearsand someone who just happens to have been to Hamunaptra. Evelyn pays for O'Connell's release, and she convinces him to take her and Jonathan to the City of the Dead. After all, it could be the find of the century! The three of them, along with O'Connell's former buddy Beni (Kevin O'Connor) leading his own party of 3 rowdy American cowboys, excavate through the City and unfortunately happen upon Imhotep's tomb. At the same time, the American tomb raiders and their snooty Egyptologist Dr. Chamberlin find the famous and powerful Black Book of the Dead, which if read correctly will bring the dead to life. Evelyn sneaks it away from Chamberlin and reads itraising Imhotep from the grave and unleashing his fury. It's now a life or death struggle as the unfortunate individuals try to escape Imhotep's vehemence. I'll let you find out for yourself what happens, should you so choose to watch the movie.This is one action movie that I could watch over and over. The dialogue, the costumes, the music, I pretty much love everything about this movie. I'm very big into Egyptian mythology, so there's one more reason why I adore this film. Even though the real Imhotep wasn't a homicidal, back-stabbing High Priest to Seti (he was actually an engineer and architect) and the Book of the Dead isn't really a book at all (rather, it is a set of papyrus scrolls laid to rest with each mummified individual), the story behind this particular Imhotep really sucked you into him. The other characters are excellent as well. I think Evelyn is my favorite movie heroine: she's got brains and a little brawn behind her, and she's not a stereotypical damsel-in-distress or sword-wielding assassin chick. She carries herself well. Jonathan is a riot, Rick is the kind of guy you would love to have as a body guard, and Imhotep himself is the most diabolical former priest to ever be resurrected. My personal favorites are the Americans: Daniels, Henderson and Burns, Daniels being my favorite of them all (Corey Johnson is one of my 5 favorite actors). Beni adds the right amount of comic relief and Jonathan Hyde's Chamberlin is perfect for the obnoxious, know-it-all professor. The plot's easy to follow, and the special effects are pretty damn good.There's nothing better than a good action movie, and 'The Mummy' is definitely among the best. I highly recommend seeing it (and its sequel, one of the few sequels I actually like). It's alright if you know nothing of Egypt and its rich, mythological past; once you get sucked in, you won't want to be pulled out.My grade: A+, 10/10",The Mummy
531,Andrew-39,Huge fun,8,29 June 1999,"Such a pleasure to see a movie that exceeds expectations for a change. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are perfectly cast as the two leads. The script has the odd shaky moment but is frequently extremely funny, always exciting and occasionally scary.  Some fantastic sets and typically superb special effects from ILM.  It's slickly shot and edited while showing a real regard for its location, no mean feat.  Best of all, it refuses to take itself seriously, continually poking fun at itself.

Production values are first rate, and the computer generated images are extremely well done.  The characters are fun to watch and Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep made a great villain. However, the scriptwriting was lazy at best, and incompetent at worst.  If Imhotep was really that powerful and evil, why make it so easy for him to come back?  It's like catching a serial killer, putting him in jail, and then leaving the keys to his cell within arm's reach.  Some ""mumbo jumbo"" during the set up was needed to explain why they simply couldn't kill Imhotep and turn him into sausage.  Go see the movie, just leave your brain at home.",The Mummy

It was really very bad. Yes, the acting was lousy, but I could look past that if the film had some other redeeming quality. Sadly, it did not. You should not be able to look at all of the characters in scene one and be able to accurately predict who is going to die and when it will happen. I could. The movie is unbelievably predictable. The jokes are just painful after about twenty minutes. They're very rarely funny and far too frequent. You really might want to miss this one (although the special effects are excellent).",The Mummy

I usually enjoy going to the movies, if not for the movie, just to get out of the house and to be with friends. But after this movie I really felt ripped off.  I paid 6 bucks to be insulted. Now this movie did have some good ideas and an intriguing story.  Some of the special effects were good (although the mummy did look like he was liquid and wasn't frightening at all).  That brings up another point. Where was the mummy?  I saw about a minute and a half of mummy footage before he returned to his human form.  Also, I couldn't be afraid of him no matter how hard I tried.  Everything he did seemed justified. I would have probably acted little differently.  I respect Brendan Frasier, and enjoyed his character up to a point.  His cheesy one-liners were as bad as Schwartzenegger's in Batman & Robin.  The rest of the casting was pretty bad, especially the chick.S U C K!!! sorry",The Mummy

How Fraser and friends foil his attempt makes for plenty of good comic-book action.This film had a lot more laughs than I expected. Even some of the action scenes included comic bits. The performances were good, and the special effects were pretty impressive, too. It's not an all-time classic, but it was much better than some newspaper reviews have said.

See it now before Star Wars comes out.The reason i love this movie is because the plot lines just take you down a river, right when you feel you can't take lectures anymore, the movie hits you with great action or a scene of pure special effects to get you into it again.

542,muffinsm,Pure unadulterated entertainment,10,8 June 1999,"So, I'll be seeing The Mummy for the seventh time this weekend.  For those of you who think that's over the top, it may be.  The first five times were at the insistence of my four-year-old daughter who has nerves of steel and came through unscathed.  I am looking for friends who haven't been fortunate enough to have seen it yet to provide me an excuse to see it again.    I should add that, although I watch movies over and over, in general (the ones I like), I rarely spend my money at the theater to do so.Many deplore the current trend of blending humor and action and drama and, in this case, horror, and romance.  But I love a movie like that.  I like getting it all.  Some have compared it to the Indiana Jones movies.  There is some justification for that and I don't think it suffers by the comparison.  If it isn't as graphically violent or as gritty (and it's not), it benefits by the excellent advances in special effects (without being made by them) and by a lead character women might well prefer since he is clearly more interested in the girl than the treasures.  In tone and humor, it could also be likened, I think, to ""True Lies"" and ""Men in Black"", partially because of the mixes of horror, action, humor and/or romance and partially because of the excellent seamless effects that are part of the story rather than included just to impress.It is not ""best picture"" material (more's the pity) because it is obviously too much fun.  It is fresh time after time, amusing and thrilling.

The story was not too complex to follow nor was it One Dimensional, the characters were likeable and the acting was excellent. One thing needs to be said, and that is Brendan Fraser stole the show.  I was at first tentative about him in an action role but I am thoroughly convinced, he delivered his lines so well that you forgot he was just playing a part.

The action well done with Brendan Fraser pulling off the part of a roguish, comical, yet competent hero.  The horror is there without delving into gratuitous violence.  The gore is only suggested and not actively shown allowing your imagination to fill in where the camera moves away and obscures the view.  A touch of comedy shows itself throughout the entire film lending an air bravado, never quite taking itself seriously.  The movie never lets up with its special effects, action, and comedy.

545,LeTiss,Not quite Indiana Jones and the Lost City in the Sand,6,8 July 1999,"The Mummy is a bit like how Indiana Jones might have looked if Hammer had made it with a big budget. Of course, it has rather more humour than Hammer would muster but it is an American summer blockbuster. What is surprising for a summer hit is that it is coherent and has a plot, albeit a simple one.It is 4000BC and Egypt is mighty. A great pharaoh rules and beside him his concubine, whom none but the monarch may so much as touch. Ah! But envy, lust and greed conspire against the pharaoh and he discovers his beautiful concubine trying on the head priest for size. Oh but what's this? They love each other, they say. Tough, says the pharaoh. Oops, scratch one pharaoh. Then scratch one head priest and concubine at the hands of the vengeful bodyguards. But death is not enough for the head priest. He is cursed to be the living dead.Still here, okay, jump forward to 1929, take one ex-foreign legionnaire just in from the desert with a treasure map showing the way to an ancient Egyptian necropolis, add one fresh faced, pretty English archaeologist and her roguish brother, and send them all off to find the loot.Of course, other parties are interested in the booty and nobody knows that amongst the loot is the cursed tomb. Right next to the loot actually. So close in fact that it is mistaken for it and the silly lot open the head priest's sarcophagus. From here on in it is monsters, chases and, rather interestingly, plagues.The gradual regeneration of the mummy from rotting corpse to general bad character at large is a triumph of computer work - no plodding baddie wrapped in rotting bandages here, you know. Brendan Fraser's character is a bit thin but he performs well enough. Rachel Weisz is very good but then her character has a bit more, er, character. Okay, the idea is preposterous and the people only semi believable, but it is fun and has a plot. That, in the summer, is very rare indeed.",The Mummy

This movie certainly cannot be compared to Kenneth Branaugh's Henry V or Stanley Kubrick's 2001, a Space Odyssey, nor should it be.  This movie is for fun, plain and simple.  The acting is adequate, the special effects are good but not overpowering, and the movie, though long, never seemed to drag on and on as others do (""The Titanic"" comes to mind).I know that there were comparisons (at least in some of the movie reviews that I read) to the new Star Wars movie.  I must honestly admit that I enjoyed this movie much more than Star Wars (and I'm a big fan of the first 3 Star Wars movies).  Maybe because unlike Star Wars, the viewer actually got to know some of the characters in the Mummy, unlike Star Wars, where the viewer had to fight through the special effects just to find out if there were real characters or not.If you want intellectual stimulus, this movie is NOT IT.

Unfortunately some ridiculous number of watches later, all I know is that I feel this is a modern children's classic that I absolutely adore.

The film tells the tales of the hidden city of Hamunaptra, where rumour has it that the ancient scripts can be read out to unleash the power of the Mummy - a man murdered for having an affair with the emporers wife, but he escaped first and cast a curse which would enable him and his love to awaken from the dead in the bodies of mortals in years to come.

553,xboxfanattic1,Childhood fave,10,5 November 2019,"I loved this movie growing up because it had all the action, adventure, fun, romance and all the badassery coupled with cheesy lines and smart dialogue. Of course there's gonna be historical discrepancies. A mummy is rising from the dead. From reading a book. I mean. We already are on a premise of fiction here this isn't a documentary far from, so to assume that everything has to be historically accurate to the last nitty gritty detail ain't gonna help you none. You gotta enjoy the film for what it is. I'm sorry it's just one of my favorite movies of all time so this is a bias review but this is cinematic gold 😂🤙🏻",The Mummy

555,Tyrell23,"Big, big fun!",9,20 December 1999,"When I read all the reviews for The Mummy, it seemed like this movie would be a poor man's Indiana Jones. And in a way, it is, but on the other hand, this movie will be one of my favorites in 1999 (I'm writing this on 20th December, so I can be pretty sure about that ;-). It's big, it's funny, it has perfect timing, great one-liners, lovable characters and lots of action. Add to this a wonderful score by Jerry Goldsmith, and the movie becomes irresistible.",The Mummy
556,DJSIII,A fun adventure film with appropriate touches of romance and suspense.,10,27 July 1999,"I enjoyed The Mummy very much.  The FX were well done and realistic.  Not that I've ever seen a 3,000 year-old mummy come to life, but I was convinced that is as it would probably look.  This is the type of movie that I'd love to see be made a franchise, ala Indiana Jones.  It packs enough adventure for 6 hours into it's approximately 2 hours running time.  The sets were very appropo and the casting was right on target.  Brendan Fraser was quite impressive as the protaganist and Rachel Weisz reminded me of Katherine Hepburn; a very strong willed woman who doesn't have a problem with being beautiful at the same time.  I reccomend this movie to anyone, including parents who want a film to babysit thier children for a few hours.",The Mummy

Probably saved this film from being rubbish.Which it's far from not, as far as Hollywood interpretations go it was very good. Good effects, nice squeaky characters, evil against good and everyone gets there comeupence!The only thing that would worry me is yet again the big film producers get too much say in mediocering a film idea. It would of been nice to see a good styled horror (like in the good old days *sob*). This should and could of been a true horror classic.",The Mummy
558,Nethen-2,This is not a film that you would expect it to be when you enter the Theatre.,7,9 May 1999,"When I went to see the Mummy with my friends, we all expected a action-suspense thriller, like Indiana Jones. Instead we got a film that was filled with jokes, nice special effects, but bad acting. I like the whole concept of the film, a man mummified alive because he loved the Pharaoh's wife, and tried to bring her back to life, and then 3 thousand years later, is brought back to the world to finish what he started. It was very interesting, but the acting in the film was horrible. The Villain, (Mummy) was played by what seems to be a new-comer actor, and some of the other bit parts were played by locales to save Universal money.",The Mummy
559,T.S.,Please bury this movie in a tomb,2,10 May 1999,"This movie is awful. Just plain awful. The acting is ludicrous. Which leads us to the disgracefull casting. Of course the best casting in the world couldn't save the script. The effects were nice, and had the potential to be horrifying. But this movie could never figure out what it wanted to be. Were they trying to take themselves seriously? In some parts, yes. In others, no. Was this supposed to be horror? adventure? camp/comedy?Turns out, it was none of the above. Probably because the actors were not sure either. From the scooby-doo footprints on the ship to the ""Thriller""-like mummy priests this movie reeked of camp. Except someone forgot to to tell the Mr. Frasier. The scenes go from Indiana Jones spoofs to Indiana Jones rip-offs in the blink of an eye.If you liked Godzilla, you'll love this movie. If not- go rent Boris Karloff's mummy. Except for the effects, it is superior in every way.",The Mummy

But I wouldn't have guessed that this movie would be so extremely dull... The movie isn't original in any way. To me that isn't necessarily a problem... There are great movies that are just variations on a theme. But 'The mummy' doesn't add anything new. It isn't funny, it isn't thrilling, and the computer graphics are nice, but nothing we haven't seen before. Save yourself 5 bucks and go rent an Indiana Jones movie.",The Mummy

563,wraith-5,Indian Jones was better. See it anyway!,8,8 May 1999,"Indian Jones and Stargate got it better.  This movie was very entertaining but lacked character. These semi-two-dimentional characters save precious time in development so that the viewer can enjoy more action and special effects.  These effects are very cool, and overall I loved the entertainment aspect of the movie.  The humorous lines and actions were a bit campy/slapstick. It was therefore somewhat less intriguing than Indian Jones' wry humor.  Overall I recommend you see it if you like Action/Adventure/Archaeology but don't be surprised when its over and there is little substance to discuss, just enjoy it for the thriller it is!",The Mummy
564,Bratch,Tongue-in-cheek and well done,10,4 December 2003,"I laughed all the way through the film. Action, humor and all tongue-in-cheek performances must have been a ball to shoot.

They were just dull and one dimensional.  And why is everyone cracking jokes when they are supposed to be witnessing something truly horrific?  If a mummy was chasing you, would you have time to stop and tell jokes?  Hell no, you'd be running for your life!  It's this carefree attitude that the movie has that brings it down.  It ends up looking like another slick Hollywood ""product"".  My rating:  6 (out of 10)",The Mummy
567,swaxman,Not enough mythology to go with the action,3,10 May 1999,"Let's face it, this movie was less about a cursed mummy and more about getting some cool special effects in before Star Wars: The Phantom Menace comes out.  The acting was poor, the one-liners were tired, and the mythology of the mummy was only given lip service.  This movie would have been much better if they had taken some of the special effects budget and used it to write a script.  The special effects, however, were good.  The only contrived part of the special effects I found was the recreation of ancient Egypt on the computer.  Somehow, computer generated-effects always look computer-generated, something that film technology needs to catch up with.",The Mummy

No characters, lots of bad digital fx and Brendan Fraser constantly throwing one liners, made the film one of the most disappointing films of this summer. I guess that good old Boris Karloff is desperately trying to raise from his sarcophagus to show Stephen Sommers what a good horror movie is all about.

If it was meant to be good at all and worth watching, it also failed.The plotline was cliche and amateurly predictable, and too little happened. It seemed as though the filmmaker was relying on the action bits and the graphics to keep the audience happy, rather than making a film with an enjoyable plot line. I had to drag myself through this film. The fact that the film apparently does not take itself seriously does not excuse the absence of a plotline or anything watchable in it.The film is just a few actors milling around, held together by the presence of once mouldy corpse and the odd punch in the face. There isn't enough of anything to make it hold together convincingly. To conclude, don't bother. I was annoyed I spent the time watching it instead of sleeping - not even worth watching once.

What I got was a really good comedy, with it elements of a horror movie. The first scene, is the scene that makes you think, wow, what a horrible movie this is gonna be. Dumb costumes and that sort of thing. Well, I was wrong. The movie shifts from a sort of ""flashback"" (not really, but sort of) into the ancient Egyptian times, to the 1930s I think it was. Soon the hero, the heroine, and the other sort of heroes are off, on a magnificent quest for the book of the dead. But they soon unlock terrible secrets. and wake up ancient evils that should have stayed untouched. This movie was hilarious!

When I see this movie now (after seeing Indiana Jones movies) I still experience the same fun as I did back then. Not that I don't like Indiana (7 out of 10) but I find Mummy much more enjoyable. The goodness in the script is you always get a feeling that movie is offering you what it promised;non stop entertainment. Among the cast Brendan Fraser is awesomely funny. Rachel Weisz is cute ( missed her in Mummy 3) John Hannah made me smile whenever he showed up and Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy) was cool.

The arabic-speaker actors had a very bad accent, very bad arabic, which decreases the opportunity of giving a live scene for the main place of the movie. The clothes were Turkish, except for the crowd allied to Amnhoteb at the end. The prison was ruled by turkish soldiers, which conflicts with the fact that Egypt was a British colony at this time.

As a result a lot of people die who we don't care for, and without sexual chemistry the romantic comedy is t-e-r-r-i-b-l-y forced. Even the special effects are soulless.

The location, the costumes, the cast -- no problem there. But did they have to settle for a sitcom-level story?The absolute cheapest element of film making is the story, and with only some (virtually free) story changes, this movie could have been great. The writer-director, Steven Sommers, chose instead to copy only the most overblown and childish aspects of Spielberg's work and let the story come afterwards, if at all.Example: At one point the heroes, pursued by evil minions, wreck their yellow roadster and escape down a manhole. In the next scene, they're zooming away in the re-incarnated roadster. The Mummy himself couldn't work that quickly.But worse were the mugging, the predictability, the one-liners, and the endless rain of bullets. Brendan Fraser even adjusts a mirror by shooting at it from across a room. No, I'm not kidding.Remember the previews? They showed only serious action/adventure; that's what I expected to see.

Plot was reasonably predictable, humor somewhat adolescent (which meant that I liked it).My only problem with the film was that I found it very hard to see the Mummy as *EEEEVIL*.  Obsessed, yes.  Insane, probably.  But evil?  He was far too sympathetic a character to dislike, and in the end, Arnold Vosloo's voice, gestures, and expression made it difficult for me to root for ""the good guys.""I would love to see Vosloo in some more films (not to mention Rachel Weizs (she has an absolutely captivating face!)",The Mummy

I was dragged along and expected to only see half the movie, but was quickly engrossed in this wonderfully epic tale and amazed at the special effects so much, that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.The story tells a timeless tale woven around a beautiful country with a wonderfully rich history. Something to remember is that it is based around the mythology and beliefs of an ancient society, and you can't get better storylines than that.Of course the actors played their part, by portraying action, adventure, horror, comedy and romance beautifully.  John Hannah was great (as always), Brendan Fraser showed he can do action and adventure as well as the next man, Rachel Weisz was also very good as the beautiful heroine. 
BUT Arnold Vosloo and Oded Fehr, not taking anything away from other cast members these guys were fantastic. I have to agree with 'catmom2' I definitely would like to see more of both these actors.  Arnold Vosloo, where have you been? His portrayal of the Mummy was magnificent, who in all his evilness still looked vulnerable, I have to admit to feeling sorry for The Mummy.  Oded Fehr, well I'm sorry for falling into the superficiality trap, but his dark and brooding good looks were definitely put to good use.This is a movie that I would recommend to my friends, who enjoy a good story with enough action to keep you interested but not too much blood and guts, some great one-liners and comedy scenes that have you chuckling and of course the fluffy little romance story for those of us who think there's too little of it in the world today.",The Mummy

601,Cavebear,"A solid film, but you may want to wait until the video.",5,11 May 1999,"In 1926 Egypt, a spunky librarian/Egyptologist (Weisz) saves the life of an American Foreign Legionnaire (Fraser) who claims to have been to Hamunaptra--the ancient Egyptian City of the Dead. She is looking for the book of Amon Ra, but finds a 3,000 year old mummy who's having a really rotten day.Let me begin by saying that I'm really not fond of horror films. I generally stay away from movies that have the primary purpose of scaring the audience. So, what was I doing at THE MUMMY?That can be answered in two words: Brendan Fraser. I have enjoyed Fraser's performances in past films and find him to generally be a likable character. Unfortunately, he was miscast as the lead character of Rick O'Connell. In a role that called for cool-headed stoicism, he came across as stiff and befuddled. I believe his ""Encino Man"" and ""George of the Jungle"" characters have rubbed off on him. He was monosyllabic to the point of muteness.The script tried to give Fraser plenty of Arnold-esque throwaways to evoke laughter, but Fraser simply does not have Schwarzenegger's panache. Beyond a few mild chuckles, there wasn't much to evoke the campy feel that I believe the producers wanted. Fraser is affable, almost goofy, but he tried too hard to be hard-bitten when he should have accentuated his little-boy persona.There was a distinct ""been-there-done-that"" aura surrounding this entire production. The set-pieces and sequences were strictly by-the-book thriller/action cliches ripped from countless other like-minded films. We have flesh-eating scarab beetles, ancient spells, American treasure-hunters, British intellectuals, a groveling evil sidekick, mysterious desert tribesmen, and lots of skeletal undead shuffling about.I also found the effects and cinematography to be disappointing. I like to get a ""movie"" experience when paying for a theatre ticket, and THE MUMMY failed to deliver. Much of the film plays out in the claustrophobic labyrinth beneath Hamunaptra. While the lighting was always done well-enough to see the action, it would look much the same on a small screen as it did on the large. And the CGI mummy was stiff and mechanical. Especially in the full-body shots, it moved more like a stop-motion model than computer wizardry.There were a few good scenes. One set of warrior mummies move with the grace and speed of giant cats. An old warrior gets a final chance at redemption and brings a lump to your throat. And there's some pretty good sword fighting in the climactic scene. In general, the supporting cast was solid, with decent acting jobs all around.So, what did I really like about THE MUMMY?That can also be answered in two words: Rachel Weisz. As the inept librarian, Evelyn, she simply sparkled. She was a bright, effervescent light in a gray film. She added color and levity to every scene and bubbled over with more personality than most of the rest of the cast combined. Her naivete layered over a harder core makes her one of the more interesting heroines to appear on the silver screen in some time. THE MUMMY is definitely worth a look see for her appearance alone.But you may want to wait until the video is released.Cavebear's ranking for THE MUMMYQuality - 3: Solid, if unspectacular, film.Appeal - 2: Nothing new or exciting to offer fans or non-fans of the genre, but should play well until the Stars fall on May 19.

602,Akuma-3,A great adventure movie for the whole family!,10,15 May 1999,The Mummy offers a easy to follow plot with great characters.  This movie has it all from the laughable moments to the terrifying(for u kiddies) moments!  This movie isn't slow paced and does a very good job at keeping the movie in motion with unexpected events.  I am usually skeptical of a PG-13 movie's performance but this one did outstandingly well!,The Mummy
603,Gary-120,YES Thumbs UP!,9,23 May 1999,This is not just another replay of an old story. They did a very good job of building suspense. The special effects will knock your socks off. I smell a sequel in the making.,The Mummy
604,Juan X.,"For the laughs and effects, but not chills",7,26 July 1999,"If you go see ""The Mummy"" expecting to be scared out of your wits, you will be very disappointed.  ""The Mummy"" is not a scary, horrifying movie.And it doesn't intend to be.It's hard to take the antagionist Imothep seriously when every time he roars, his jaw grows as big as Jay Leno's.  Of course this movie doesn't intend to take itself seriously, as evidenced by the silly accident in the curator's library scene about 10-15 minutes into the movie.The acting was not above average, and there are loopholes in the plot you could drive a truck through, such as what are American cowboys doing in Africa in the 1920's?  However, the special effects were excellent, especially the sandstorm scene.""The Mummy"" probably won't be the worst thing you'll see this year.  It might even be entertaining.  All in all, it's not a bad movie to take in if you're looking for something to do on a lazy afternoon.Rating: 7",The Mummy
605,Hallur-2,A really bad movie,2,12 July 1999,"I was really disappointed with this movie because I had pretty high expectations. The trailer was pretty exciting, but it turned out that all the good stuff in this movie was in the trailer. The movie tried both to be spooky and funny but failed on both accounts. The mummy was stupid and the main characters were boring stereotypes, the female lead was especially annoying. The script is very bad and the direction is not good either. This movie is a huge backwards step from Sommers last movie, Deep Sea Rising which was much better.I did give this picture 2, because some of the special effects were quite good.",The Mummy
606,ChrisC-8,A review of a new take on the classic horror,8,12 July 1999,"Back in 1932, The Mummy, starring Boris Karloff, had a quiet eeriness about it - it still does. I didn't know what to expect almost seventy years later when Universal released a modern update of the horror tale. With all the fuss over the latest computer generated imagery, I knew that it would either be another special effects laden summer blockbuster, or an exciting adventure in the tradition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. I suppose it was a bit of both, boasting some breathtaking effects in one of the best adventure films of recent years.After the opening Universal globe dissolves into a desert sun - think back to the beginning of Raiders and the Paramount logo - we are introduced to Imhotep, played by Arnold Vosloo, in Ancient Egypt. When he is found with the pharaoh's mistress, he is mummified alive and sealed inside a coffin with flesh-eating scarabs while the mistress kills herself in hope that he will resurrect her. Sound unpleasant? It's a way of getting the audience's attention from the very beginning - that's for sure. Then we cut to the 1920's where ex-American Legionnaire, Rick O'Connell, a dashing Brendan Fraser, is being chased away from The Hidden City of Hamunaptra by black robed guards. Librarian, Evelyn, played by Rachel Weisz, and her money-grubbing brother, Jonathan, played by John Hannah, free O'Connell from execution years later in hope that he will lead them to the city. And indeed off they go, only O'Connell suspecting underlying evil, with the opposing explorers, among them Kevin J. O'Connor and Jonathan Hyde, hot on their trail. Of course when they reach the city, the mummy is unleashed and in turn he sets out to bring his love back from the dead, destroy those who stole the Book of the Dead from his chest and generally cause a lot of havoc and mayhem.If all of this sounds a little silly, then you're right - it is. But it is the kind of light-hearted excitement a summer blockbuster should be. While the film doesn't offer too much in the way of character depth, Fraser comes across as a likeable hero, providing the brawn; Weisz is the respectable librarian-turned-adventurer, providing the brains; and Hannah plays the witty Englishman who provides most of the humour. Saying that, the humour doesn't always work and Fraser's over-the-top heroism is at times irritating. The art direction is worthy of mention, and when the director allows the camera to pull back over a scene, the film looks fantastic, perfectly recreating turn-of-the-century Egypt. Add to that Jerry Goldsmith's exotic and exciting score and you get the best period adventure in a long time. The Mummy isn't without fault, but with all the drivel Hollywood has produced over the last few summers, this is definitely worth a look.",The Mummy
607,Anastasi-2,the best movie ever made!!!,10,12 July 1999,"I love this movie.  I've seen it two times in theater and now going to see it the third time.  Each time I see it, it seems better!I feel so sorry for Imhotep (the mummy).  Everyone is so mean to him!  And most of what happened was not his fault.  Everything he did was out of his love for Anck-Su-Namum!",The Mummy
608,jbashe,"Slightly related to the 1932 Karloff classic, but fun and flawed",3,2 December 1999,"This go-around of the Mummy genre is flawed (when you find Imhotep the best character in the movie, it's flawed). However, it's fun in an Indiana Jones way.  The director needs to trim the film down to about 90 minutes and tighten up the story.  For example the flying scene with Bernard Fox is superfluous.  But for a Saturday matinee, it's OK.  Hope you didn't pay full price to see it.",The Mummy
609,Dazzer-3,Not that bad,4,11 September 1999,The Mummy had some very good special effects and it was very loud which made me jump. but the storyline was not that spectacular and i didn't think that it was worth the money to go and see it. If you want my advice go and see it for the special effects but nothing else.,The Mummy
610,Kaggis,A good choice to spent your Saturday night.,5,18 October 1999,"When I first heard about `The Mummy' I thought it would be one of Hollywood's overproduction movies that require a good cinema with Dolby surround sound, hi-tech projection machines and of course a big pack of pop-corn in order to enjoy the astounding special effects and the breathtaking actions scenes. Usually this kind of movies are depended on their Visual Effects because the screenplay is very poor. But when I saw the movie I realized that I was wrong. Mummy's story is depended on an ancient Egyptian legend about Hamunaptra `the city of the dead'. It is said that there, under the sand, it is buried for 30.000 years the ultimate evil, the mummy of an ancient priest who disobeyed the orders of the Pharaoh and fell in love with his wife. The movie has a fair screenplay with immediate responses that some times are really good and some times dead as dodo and boring. Brendan Frazer (you must remember his from `George of the jungle' or `God and Monsters') is playing his role quite good. However, the most powerful feature of the movie is the amazing scenes and the astounding Visual Effects (made by `Industrial Light & Magic': Star Wars Series). To sum up Mummy is a good choice to spend your Saturday night and watching it you may feel like watching an `Indiana Jones' movie. Rating: 5,9/10",The Mummy
611,Austin Q.,Hard to rate,8,27 November 1999,"This movie was hard for me to rate, because some of the lines were so cheesy, but they were cheesy enough to be funny.  I feel the same way about the acting.  Also, there were some of the best 3D animation I've seen yet. I gave it an 8 mostly because of the superb special effects.  And, I don't think they took themselves way too seriously.  I liked it enough to see the sequel.",The Mummy

I really couldn't tell from the previews. Then it exploded in the theatres and it still didn't interest me.  Until one day i was walking through a movie store and i picked up the box.  I looked at it and bought it.  Imagine my surprise when it quickly became one of my favorite movies ever.  There are very few movies that were ever as much fun to sit through and watch.  I watched it three times the weekend i bought it and never got bored.  The special effects helped move the movie along, but the movie had a story and a plot.  In the tradition of Indiana Jones and Jerry Bruckheimer flicks, this action/adventure is definitely worth viewing. You want to have fun at home, this is one way.  Go out and buy it.",The Mummy

Perhaps the story and acting isnt great but thats not what summer movies are about...there about being entertained for an hour or 2 just like this movies does.Unlike the over hyped,over rated,and over blown Phantom Meance this is actually fun which Phantom Meance should have been. The special effects are awesome, Im suprised they werent nominated for an Oscar. Everyone invovled seems to have fun from Fraser to Sommers in making this adventure.

Whatever you see, don't rent this movie, its a waste of time and money! So far, from what I've seen of Brendon(or however you spell it) Fraser he's an awful actor! This movie gets a bomb from me.

617,z46629,A brilliant parody of the action/horror genre,9,4 February 2008,"Reading the most highly-rated comments for this film, I've seen many praising the action and the ""fun-factor"". But none have highlighted what for me takes this film to a higher level, which is the way that it adroitly and subtly sends up every mummy/horror/action film in the genre.It is a masterpiece: the progressing bullet-holes in the paddle-steamer's side, about to take Fraser's head off; the salute as the bi-plane sinks into the sand; the dismembered arm reaching for the sword at *just* the right moment. It is simply the most ingenious parody I have ever seen -- and it does it all with such grace that most viewers never even noticed.But for those who are aware of it, there are a few signposts to show that this parody is intentional. The one that stands out in my mind is the camp-fire that flickers every time someone mentions something otherworldly, until one of the characters remarks, ""That happens a lot around here, doesn't it?""This film is comic timing at its best. Rachel Weisz, Brendan Fraser and John Hannah are clearly having a ball, and who can blame them? This film has it all -- action, comedy, great lines and a hot librarian.",The Mummy
618,7the_mummy_rules7,Simply the Best!,10,6 February 2002,"This is my absolute favorite movie! I first watched it at a friends house last year. It was a few weeks ago I saw it again. It was a Friday night and my younger sister and I were flipping through the channels when I noticed the scene where Rick (Brendan Frasier) and Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor) are about to open fire on the approaching horsemen. I told her to hold on and explained what movie it was. Since then, I've seen it seven times on the same channel.My male cousin enjoyed it for the action (there's some form of a lethal weapon in nearly every scene!). My sister liked it for the comedy. I myself liked everything about it; ancient Egypt has always held my interest.It was a good movie. All the characters seemed to be given to the appropriate people.Just one thing: why did Beni say, ""Nice camel,"" when he himself was riding one? It doesn't make the show any worse, but that didn't make sense. I guess it's because they wanted Beni to fall off the camel, and I doubt Rick could've reached him if he was riding a horse. (should've cut the comment then, huh?)Over all, it was great, and I don't see why so many people were complaining about the jokes. Lighten up a bit, people!",The Mummy

622,gb111950,Could it get any worse?,1,11 February 2004,"This remains, even after 5 years, solidly at the top of my ""worst films ever"" list. It is simply the absolute worst film I have ever seen. If it was meant to be irritatingly laughable then it is extremely successful, but if so it still isn't up my street. The money went, quite clearly, on special effects. That is, a calamitous jumble of humorous 'spirits' and the likes. I.e. pure garbage.The remaining 1% of the budget probably (if they were lucky) went on the cast and the script writer. This had the best collection of the nation's (I really mean planet's) worst actors/actresses. They were painfully bad and if I'm being honest, it's probably this that distracts you from the 99% that was spent on the effects. Maybe that is a slight alleviation for Sommers from delivering the worst film of all time, but he's pushing it.The dialect and script is so bad you feel embarrassed for the cast that they have to further relinquish their barely existent reputations by nearly enacting them.Now that I have slated this awful, awful movie, I will advise anyone who hasn't seen it never to even pick up the box and read it. The fact that this was so popular (admittedly among kids) is unlikely to be beaten as the biggest mystery on the face of the earth",The Mummy

Matrix 2-3 were high-budget, but non-democratic flicks. mummy 2 sucked too, but we will - in this review - not care about that - its the money honey. the first part will have its way to a real classic - why? it did not bother with a love story (wich, as we all know, is not the reason to watch this particular movie) but 1tries to entertain quite ALL OF THE TIME.

There is a good deal of action and some rather good comedy mixed in with it.

630,superman-8,Heh. Indiana Jones meets slapstick and camp. You gotta love it.,8,3 June 1999,"The Mummy? If you only saw the previews for it, you'd think it was a SPFX-filled horror flick. If you go to see it, your perceptions will be adjusted to see that it's a SPFX-filled campy comedy-type filled flick *tinged* with horror. Think: Indiana Jones meets, oh, not quite the 3 Stooges, but close. It basically brings back the feeling of the campy Saturday afternoon ""horror"" flicks - with a lot more humor. Admittedly, some of the scenes were downright creepy - flesh-devouring beetles (that you never really see doing such, it's only 99% implied), ghouls crawling rapidly after the good guys - down the sides of the walls, that sort of thing. But this film is so peppered with 1-liners, staged comedic spills and the like, it's very difficult to take as a pure horror flick - or to stop your lips from splitting open in a hearty belly laugh. Brendan Fraser parodies Indiana Jones wonderfully - with more humor, smugness, and dare I say it, giggly attempts at romance. People might slam his performance, but I'd say it's as solid as Keanu ""Huh?"" Reeves in ""The Matrix"" (is that a bad thing to say here? I don't think so.) Rachel Weisz puts on a great performance as the slightly-off-kilter knowledgeable Egyptologist, and has a handful of priceless 1-liners and slapstick scenes in points...and Arnold Vosloo... well...for a pretty minimalist acting job, I thought his screen charisma and presence stood out pretty strongly. I'd second other people's thoughts here in that he looked a lot like Billy Zane in ""The Phantom"". He did! Able supporting cast, creepy opportunist-turned-darkside's-evil-henchman played aptly by Kevin O'Connor...great scenery, wonderfully designed sets...and did I mention the SPFX yet??? :) It all ends predictably enough, but it's an enjoyable ride - and one that will bring more laughs to your face than you expect. Dunno if it's worth buying on DVD, but plunk down your $X and see this movie - it's a nice piece of lighter fare which could balance out your diet of serious, grimmer stuff (Matrix) or larger-than-life wanna-be legends (Star Wars Ep. 1)...etc. Check it out.",The Mummy

The comedy was very dry and a complete failure.  Not one line made me chuckle.  The romance was completely non-existent.  There were hundreds of plot holes, unexplained phenomenon, and completely unbelievable feats.  Things like camels beating horses in a race.  The acting was very impressive considering the dialogue was horrible. Most of the movie, even the beginning was very predictable.  You sat through it knowing what was going to happen, and waiting out the supposedly ""humorous parts""  just to see the special effects.

636,GBailey-2,Formula: (Congo x Army of Darkness) + Raiders of the Lost Ark - Good writing,6,9 May 1999,"You take the first rate production values (and lame script) of ""Congo;"" mix in the undead, book of the dead that is accidentally used to release the villain, & the goofy protagonist of ""Army of Darkness"" and have everyone convince themselves they're doing the next Indiana Jones movie. Half bake for 2 hours and you've got ""The Mummy."" This movie is to Raiders what ID4 was Star Wars:  Lame junk that may vaguely remind you of a classic while making a mint based solely on top notch special effects.What's good about the movie:  Likable cast and great CGI.  Set Design is top drawer as well. Also if you have kids it will scare them without traumatizing them for life.  Most of the grisly action takes place off screen or in silhouette.What's not so good:  Brendan Fraser plays his usual goofy guy that people loved in ""George of the Jungle.""  He also (like Chris O'Donnell in ""In Love and War"") cannot play a non-contemporary character. This fact is really another caveat (however unintentional) to Bruce Campbell's hero in ""Army of Darkness.  Fraser is not alone in his plight however, as every American character in the supporting cast would be hard to believe as a person from 1975 let alone 1925. Luckily they are all so non-descript and are killed off so quickly you'll have to think hard to remember any of them.The action scenes are done like a video game.  Fraser runs around with two guns that hold impossibly large quantities of bullets shooting everything that moves.  These types of scenes are really exciting when done with style like John Woo, however, that never happens in this movie.  The hand to hand combat also reminded me of playing Double Dragon on my old Nintendo system. The moment where you actually suspend your disbelief and worry that the hero won't succeed never occurs.
The supporting cast is mostly unremarkable.  Rachel Weisz (the poor man's Helena Bonham Carter) is quite beautiful but so are the Rocky Mountains and she lacks their depth.  It's not really fair to put her down that way, let's just say she's equal to the material she has to work with.Kevin J. O'Conner just does an ethnic version of the same character he played in writer/director Stepehn Sommers' last opus ""Deep Rising."" (I suppose he is Toshiro Mifune to Sommers' Kurosawa.) Granted Mr. O'Connor is reprising a role from a movie no one saw and he plays it well so I guess he could actually qualify as a highlight. He certainly is trotted out whenever they need comic relief.  As a bonus to fans of ""Bewitched"" Dr. Bombay also makes an appearance as a WW1 bi-plane pilot.In the final analysis, this certainly isn't a bad film...just dopey. Remove the digital effects and it's a Roger Corman movie.  Unlike the effects heavy Matrix there is not a single innovative idea to be enjoyed.  This movie will linger with you about as long as it takes you to digest your popcorn into what the script was from the beginning.",The Mummy

I felt that Fraser was able to portray O'Connell with the quick thinking and fighting ability of Ford's Indiana Jones and with the attitude of Ford's Han Solo.  I'm not saying that Brendan Fraser is our next Harrison Ford, but we could do worse.  Fraser was great.The movie itself was well made and kept me interested.  My wife would not go so I had to take a friend with me (the bugs would have really bothered her). I very good series of action scenes and a lot of suspense.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I gave it an 8, but it was almost a nine.  And I am picky!Go see it if you like action or even action with a sense of the melodramatic and romance.  Worth the investment.Jay",The Mummy

Highly recommended.",The Mummy
640,chicki,This movie was awful. Although it started out fai...,1,10 May 1999,"This movie was awful.  Although it started out fairly strong I could still tell that it had gone through several rewrites.  Meaning the dialogue was stupid.  Not only that it didn't make sense.  I don't mean to be to obvious, but it reminded me of another production about Egypt that depended solely on special effects and had no real story to speak off, Stargate.The Mummy tried very hard to be Indiana Jones, and unfortunately Brendan Frasier is not as strong an actor as Harrison Ford.  The female lead was very strongly played both for intelligence, vulnerability, and tremendous sex appeal.  However her talents were largely wasted here.  All in all this turkey was for the most part unwatchable, and save for the incredible special affects the money spent on this movie could have fed starving people in Brazil.  Trust me, the world could have done without The Mummy.  A tip for the failing Universal Corporation:  Stop making bad movies.",The Mummy

642,Indy-27,Awesome movie! In the same vein as Indiana Jones.,10,10 May 1999,"""The Mummy"" for myself, was an instant classic.  It had everything: action, romance, comedy and some stunning Special effects.  I was amazed at how the film was so potent and adventurous.  It had some obvious influences (ie. Raiders of the Lost Ark,  old adventure serials, etc.) but I think they created something new here.It has some queasy sequences that might turn off a few viewers, but it is done in such a fun way that you hardly notice, like the ""Indiana Jones"" series.  It is not quite as good as the Indy pictures but it is something to tide us over until Indiana Jones 4.  For fans of adventure and comedy alike see ""The Mummy""!",The Mummy
643,KrysBear,"enjoyable, great effects, Frasier proves himself as an action/adventure type",9,14 May 1999,"I enjoyed this film despite the lack of solid dialogue and (at times) schlocky storyline. Although Frasier's role in the film is not immediately apparent, he dives right into a character that resembles a young Indiana Jones and pulls it off nicely. The most of the computer generated effects were very good, but no animation house has mastered human character animation so the early movements of the mummy Imhotep are awkward and unconvincing. I give it a nine on a ten point scale. Mostly attributed to Frasier's contribution.",The Mummy

It feels just like a Saturday matinee, with great action, great comedy, and great thrills. The most important thing to keep in mind for this film is that it is not meant to be any single one genre, but rather a very effective mix of these genres.The elements of horror are perhaps better described as thrills, as The Mummy tends to rely on a few ""things that pop out"" scares. This helps create a sort of background tension that crops up throughout the first half of the film, in spite of the rather goofy humour.  The action sequences are well-done as well, adding to the conglomeration of genres represented. The overall effect is a movie that spreads itself perhaps just a trifle thin, but still provides an excellent amount of fun and adventure.",The Mummy

I had a good time and really enjoyed some of the special effects, in particular, the sword fights between the Brenden Frasier character and the reanimated subordinate mummies. However, some of the campy dialogue made me cringe, and I felt that many of the punch lines fell flat with the audience. Some of the acting was second rate, although I enjoyed Frasier in the lead.

It features way too many john woo-esque gunfights (which is a very good thing) and periodic spurts of humor (the moment where brendan fraser holds up the cat for Im-Ho-Tep comes to mind), which separates it from other CG effects guidebooks.

Is it fun and entertaining? YES. That's why this film will bring in over 100 million this summer. See it and enjoy it for what it is, a 1999 movie thats draws from the monster movies of the 50's and adventure movies of the 80's.

It had elements that inspired a variety of reactions. It had its thrilling moments, amusing moments. The special effects were excellent, some of the things they did were absolutely stunning. The sets were really lavishly done. The monuments and locations portrayed looked extremely authentic. While there were a couple of graphic scenes, the humour was placed in just such a way to break any frightening scenes for children or younger viewers.

656,boobless,A light-hearted update with all-due respect to the original.,8,10 May 1999,"As a fan of the original Universal horror films, I dreaded the idea of a big-budget production replete with CGI; however, I was pleasantly surprised by this remake of 1932's ""The Mummy"".The story takes the original idea (old not-dead guy wants old dead high school sweetheart back) and gives it a 90's scarier-than-then tweak. Imhotep, a bad-ass Egyptian priest gets fresh with Pharoah's woman, and as punishment receives the worst death/curse in the books.  Unfortunately, as with most curses, if you find that book, he comes back.  And like most catch-22's, he's a booger to kill.Fortunately, like Richard Chamberlain's Allan Quartermain films, this action-filled horror film is sprinkled with good-natured humor which intrudes only once, fortunately at the beginning.  Gunplay is superb, as long as you dig good old-fashioned multi-six-shooter gunfights.  And historically the film does a good job, and very little of the fictionalized Egyptian culture is questionable.What surprised me most about the film is the special effects. The CGI as said before is the best I've seen in a long time, and only falters when more than one beetle is on screen and when .22 caliber machine gun shells make manhole-sized pocks in the face of a sandstorm.  The worst effect regrettably seems to be a favorite, as Imhotep's distended jaw lets loose too many supernatural howls.  The film lags only when the romance seeps in and breaks formula a little too much in those rare places when formula works.  The denoument does seem rushed, as the curses suddenly go on hiatus after arriving in previously rapid succession.  The ending was reasonably anti-climactic, but natural, and combined with the overall good-natured feel of the film, I was reminded of the best sci-fi film in years: ""The Frighteners"", and as is rare in Hollywood, the two films could be from the same universe.In short: A respectful update; a peanut butter and jelly cast; clean, but abundant special effects; good and plenty action & humor; fluid story & presentation; worth full price admission.",The Mummy
657,j1,"If you see ANY movies this summer, DON'T see The Mummy",2,10 May 1999,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen, and I've seen a lot.  The premise is not bad, and the effects are actually quite good, but neither could save this film from the abysmal acting and god-awful script.I won't waste time describing the story, as you can find plenty of such descriptions.  I will simply note that it has a considerable number of holes.  It had potential, but fell far short.Stephen Sommers, who most recently brought us the inane Deep Rising, has made that film look like a masterpiece in comparison to The Mummy. As the writer/director, he deserves the most blame for this catastrophe, regardless of box office receipts.  Perhaps Sommers should get some writing advice from Tarantino if he wants to be witty, or at least competent.This film attempted to rely on the popular one-liner, but Brendan Fraser was not the man to pull it off.  ""Clever"" he is not.  I've seen this film compared to the Indiana Jones films, Big Trouble in Little China, and other great adventure films.  However, Fraser cannot live up to the stars of these great movies.  He did not have the timing to carry the lines.  However, I cannot place all the blame of Fraser as he had a miserable script to deal with.I don't know how anyone could possibly enjoy the banter between the characters and the off-timing one-liners which Fraser dispenses far too frequently and with far too little ability.  I was painfully reminded of Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin, to give you an idea of how bad it truly is.The film reminded me of ""Army of Darkness"" in many ways, but without the skill and flair Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell brought to that film.  The creature effects were quite similar, with the initial mummy creature looking something like the ""evil Ash.""  Also, the attempts at humor and witty one-liners were similar as well.  However, you'd be much better off watching ""Army of Darkness,"" for it is by far the superior movie.  As for comparisons with the Indiana Jones films, I will not even dignify them with a response.The Mummy is not worth your time or money.  I would suggest going to see this movie ONLY if you are so into effects that you can overlook the plot, script, acting, and all other aspects of the film.  The effects are truly the only redeeming quality, and even they really aren't anything new. Save your money.  I wish I had.",The Mummy

Fear or gore won't redeem this poorly crafted picture (remember the PG-13). The only laughs are unintentional and weak. The few mildly intriguing characters are under-developed and the protangonists are insultingly stereotypical. If you see this movie you will find the phrase ""what an idiot!"" repeatedly finding its way to the tip of your tongue.The film begins with an obvious computer simulation of the cartoonish egypt from ""the Prince of Egypt.""  The characters in this animated film are more believable than the comic-book style ones in the mummy.Once we are brought into the 20th century the movie falls apart. (about 6.5 min into the film)  The characters motivation is hokey and the props look like bad halloween costumes. I will spare you from going into great detail. And don't want to ruin anything for those half-wits who still plan to see it.If you are between the ages of 5 and 9, or dim adult you may enjoy this film. The story line is simply and predictable.

I mean, I won't tell you what they involve, but they are amazing!  I was absolutely amazed by some of the things they did.  Special effects usually can do two things: add to the story (Forrest Gump), subtract from the story.  In this movie, however, they are the story.  There is no other reason to watch this movie, in my mind. The only neat part of the movie that wasn't a special effect was in the last scene of the movie, something sparkles, adding a nice little smile to the end of the movie.

One is two be entertained and enlightened, the second is to be only entertained.  For this movie I chose the latter.I was not entertained.To try and excuse a movies poor acting, plot, and story by saying we should watch movies to be entertained and nothing more, is weak.  How deaf do I have to be to miss hearing overused cliches.  How stupid do I have to be to excuse ideas stolen from: Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and the Ten Commandments. And how blind do I have to be to miss poor special effects. Be assured people, the special effects were no better than in Raiders of the lost Ark.  However, millions of dollars weren't spent making that Nazis face melt.Why are the Yanks in this picture Cowboys?  Were Americans still taming the Wild West in 1920's.  Perhaps the vast open plains of the good ol' U.S. weren't satisfying enough.  Hey, if I think hard I seem to recall an old Saturday Morning Classic ""Roy Rogers and the Nile.""The gags in this movie were old, the jokes tired.  I laughed more at the people in the theatre who thought this junk was funny.Is there a formula machine in Hollywood that creates garbage like this.

The villain is nasty, the special effects are good and the actors are, well, OK.Unfortunately it also has several flaws. It has a large number of references to films that it has essentially copied (mainly Indiana Jones but really the whole Spielberg canon) without improving or satrizing them. The whole of the ""shock"" factor comes from extensive views of the undead with little thought to actual tension. The hero isn't very heroic; the heroine not worth saving.And I'm not convinced it isn't another in a long line of stereotyping-Arabs-as-untrustworthy-savages films that have come out of America in recent years.I'd watch the Hammer Horror film any day !",The Mummy

And then the movie really begins to be exciting. The end with a lot of mummies is actually really funny and good. So it is an exciting last hour but the movie is certainly not special and so isn't Brendan Fraser or the rest of the crew; the only one with a really good part is the South-African that plays the Mummy.

Fantastic Fun!,10,21 May 2001,"The mummy (1999) is the return of the Egyptian terror theme renewed and updated to the 90's.The story is good, compelling and exciting like an Indiana Jones movie while having some fun and humor into it.The egyptian theme has been thoroughly researched by director Stephen Sommers: -the name Imhotep is truely egyptian (not invented) as it relates to the famous Imhotep, architect of thee stepped pyramid of Saqqara.-Secondly, the egyptian reading and speaking are also correct. -the statues of Horus and Anubis correspond to the egyptian style (not like in Stargate where the eye of horus symbol is displayed but named ""eye of ra"")The actors are excellent with a slight ""British humor"" style which is definitely refreshing in an American movie.Finally the special effects are mind-blowing with a superb opening shot in the ancient city of Thebes. The digital mummies are also greatly rendered by ILM.Whatever aspects of this movie you prefer (action, humor, story, SFX) you'll definitely love it.A true gem 10/10.",The Mummy

(Not to mention all the good looking men) (I wish there was more of Oded Fehr Ardeth Bey) Brendan Frazier and Rachel Weiss are a perfect pair. They set each other off and bring out the best and worst of each other. U cant help but love them. Jonathon is an excellent comic relief as well as Beni. Arnold Vosloo as Imohtep is awesome. These men have perfect bodies!!!!!!I would recommend this movie 2 everyone!!! My children and nephews love it, too (they r ages 5-13)... action, drama, fantasy, horror, comedy...

I watched the 1932 mummy and i fought it was crap it was so cheesy. In the 1999 mummy it has the best special effects best music great acting and the feel of egypt. The mummy is my all time favourites thanks to stephen summers who directed it and ILM( Industrial light And Magic) the special effects people. This movie is well directed , well scripted, and well acted. I thank the people that did this film because i love it. borrow this film watch it and buy it you'll love it.....",The Mummy

This movie will blow your mind by its action, romance, adventure and music score. I loved The Mummy because it's one of those roller coaster rides were you just jump on and never let go. The Mummy is a remake of the 1932 mummy which starred Boris Karloff who played imhotep. The Mummy is about an expedition of treasure seeking explorers in the Sahara desert in 1925. They stumble upon an ancient tomb, the hunters without knowing set loose a 3,000 year-old inheritance of terror, which is personified in the vengeful reincarnation of an Egyptian priest who had been sentenced to an infinity as one of the living dead. I love watching this movie in 1999 at the big screen. This movie made me love Egypt a lot. I guarantee this movie a classic. Do not compare this with the 1932 movie.  Thanks to director Stephen Sommers which he did a wonderful job on this fantastic film. If you want to see this movie do not watch the 1932 one watch the 1999 one because it will blow you away. Last things to wrap this up Spectacular special effects, Roller coaster adventure, Funny moments, Out of the world music score, Superb acting and wonderful cast.

693,vortex_lip,Mummies! Beetles! Sand! WooHoo!,8,6 September 2008,"The Plot: A librarian and her brother save a prisoner from an untimely death by recruiting him to help locate a fabled Egyptian tomb, and set off into the desert to find not only treasure, but a labyrinthine burial ground for a cursed Mummy who, in the course of the adventure, ""accidentally"" becomes resurrected and wreaks havoc on everyone with a fez, dress or gun. The Pros: More than anything this film is very funny, especially if you pay attention to the witticisms in between the main dialog. Then there's the entertaining and very well done special effects (watch for the scenes with the mummy-induced sand-storms; pretty amazing stuff). The slapstick doesn't make for a very good horror film, but it does still manage to get it's ""grossness-quotient"" in with flesh eating beetles and soul-sucking rotting corpses (great effects again done to make the Mummy appear, well - ""juicy"", as they say in the movie). The acting is as good as it's going to get for a film of this genre, which in my opinion outshines even the Indiana Jones trilogy. Brendan Fraser is just plain perfect - delivering one uproarious line after the other - much more entertaining than Harrison Ford IMHO. Special nod to Rachel Weisz for being unexpectedly funny for what could have been a typical damsel-in-distress role. Check the memorable quotes section for sample dialog - good stuff!The Cons: The Mummy Returns does not satisfy, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (The Mummy 3) is even worse, and the Scorpion King, which stole it's plot from The Mummy Returns, is worse than drinking bleach. On an empty stomach. Great Scenes: Omid Djalili as Warden Gad Hassan who, about 45 minutes into the film, runs into the scene screaming and hands clasped atop his fez as beetles devour him alive. I've replayed this scene at least 20 times, and each time it just gets funnier and funnier.",The Mummy

695,ochenko-teresa,Awesome roller coaster adventure!,9,22 March 2012,"I will have to say that ""Mummy"" was an action adventure film in the spirit of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I know there have been other attempts over the years, but ""The Mummy"" comes the closest to hitting the mark.""The Mummy"", directed by Stephen Sommers, is the story of librarian and aspiring archaeologist Evelyn (Rachel Wiesz), accompanied by her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), enlisting the help of French Foreign Legion soldier Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) to find a lost Egyptian city. I prefer not to say more as this type of plot is best when the story unfolds before you.Sommers directing is fast paced. There is never a dull moment, never a talky interlude to break the tone of the action. Every scene in the film is necessary for the plot advancement. Director Sommers knows an inherent part of any action film is to keep the camera moving. There are very few ""static shots"".The special effects, by ILM, are fantastic. I was hooked from the opening sweeping shot of a bustling city in ancient Eygpt, beautifully recreated.Brendan Fraser is a very credible action hero. As Rick O'Connell, he has such a clumsy, boyish charm you can't help but like him. With a half smile and his perchant for the understatement (""You brought a new friend back from the desert, didn't you Beni?""), he is almost the equal of Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones. Rachel Weisz is wonderful as the aspiring archaeologist Evelyn and John Hannah is fun as her near do well missionary brother Jonathan. Kevin J. O'Conner as scared of his own shadow Beni (I won't reveal what his role is in the story) is delightful.What keeps this film from being the equal of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is the lack of character curve. Unlike Indiana Jones, who learned the hard way to respect powers he can't touch or see, I can't think of anything any of the characters in ""The Mummy"" learned.However, ""The Mummy"" is still rip-roaring entertainment. Sommers and Executive Producer Kevin Jarre (screenwriter, ""Glory"") wisely created a film with an emphasis on action. They must have figured (rightly so) that any story about the Mummy presented to 1999 audiences would just not be scary, so the tone was changed to action/adventure.Action films greatly rely on the ability to make the audience believe that what they see is possible within the first five to ten minutes. If this doesn't happen, the viewer will have a poor experience for the rest of the film. Most action films cannot achieve this. They ""shoot their bolt"" too early, rendering the rest of the film unbelievable. Also, the closer an action film is to related reality, the more difficult this becomes. Like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (still my all time favorite action film), ""The Mummy"" allowed me to suspend my disbelief within the first ten minutes.",The Mummy
696,TRowley23,"The Mummy is a great movie, enough said.",7,26 May 2004,"The Mummy may not seem like a movie worthy of a 7/10 rating but that's only because viewers don't take the time to look at the movie with an open mind. The Mummy was an action movie that involved not only comedy but also a sense of adventure. This movie deserves more applause than it originally received. The Mummy didn't necessarily have the best plot or even the greatest acting, but a movie cannot be judged on those two characteristics alone. A movie should be judged on what you take away from it. What I took away from this movie was that it was funny, exciting, and original. That is enough in my opinion to qualify The Mummy as a great movie. Even if you've seen the movie once or twice try to watch it again and see what you take away from the movie, then judge it as you see fit.",The Mummy

I think this movie mixes perfectly lots of genres, suspense, thriller, some horror, lots of action, some romance and comedy. I don't think any other movie does as brilliantly as The Mummy does.And all the characters are likeable, even the villains. Rick is the tough guy with a soft heart, Evelyn the brains of the operation, Jonathan the funny guy, Imhotep the baddie who only wants his girlfriend back. Some people complain about historic inaccuracies, well... if you want to have an ancient egyptian masterclass, go to the History Channel, this movie's purpose is to entertain, not educate.It's still perfect for a Sunday afternoon with all the family (well, not little kids, it may be a bit too much for them).",The Mummy

I do not think those scenes are very friendly, but make the more mature film to be a product that is recommended for over 7 years. At least in my country that is the age to see this movie.The best scene in the movie is when Imhotep steals eyes to Burns.

700,psycosid-10273,The Mummy franchise relaunch by Universal.,10,25 August 2017,"I like it when the Universal relaunched the franchise ""The Mummy"" is a 1999 American action fantasy film which was written and directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Kevin J. O'Connor, with Arnold Vosloo in the titular role as the reanimated mummy. It is a loose remake of the 1932 film The Mummy, which starred Boris Karloff in the titular role. The film follows adventurer Rick O'Connell, who travels to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, with an archaelogist and her brother. There they accidentally awaken Imhotep, a high priest from the reign of the pharaoh Seti I, who has been cursed for eternity.Filming began in Marrakech, Morocco, on May 4, 1998, and lasted seventeen weeks; the crew had to endure dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the Sahara. The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular Mummy. Jerry Goldsmith provided the orchestral score.The Mummy opened on May 7, 1999, and grossed $43 million in 3,210 theaters during its opening weekend in the United States; a surprise hit, the film went on to gross $416 million worldwide. The box-office success led to a 2001 sequel, The Mummy Returns, as well as The Mummy: The Animated Series, and the prequel/spin-off film The Scorpion King. Seven years later, the third installment, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, opened on August 1, 2008. Universal Pictures also opened a roller coaster, Revenge of the Mummy, in 2004.

The actors with Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and many others did a good job in this movie. The scarab bugs are very instant and very scary to the audiences, The scarab bugs that could eat the flesh of whatever creature they could catch, particularly humans.The movie has lots of awesome action, suspenseful moments, such as flying an airplane and getting chases by the Mummy sandstorm, the final battle scene with the Mummy. It stays true to the Egyptian culture, and the recreation of late 1920's Eqypt is well done. The story is pretty well written and it didn't take a lot of elements from other movie companies, and this written story does its own Indiana Jones inspiration, but it has different styles throughout the entire movie. It was a huge success, and it had an movie inspired Universal Studios theme park attraction called Revenge of the Mummy in Orlando and Hollywood Florida, and even in Singapore.Overrall, it's fun, and it great!Hope you like my review! :)All rights goes to Hasbro, and Universal Pictures.",The Mummy

The special effects are good, and though parts are quite cheesy and/or campy, it wasn't a bad film.  In fact, this is probably the first ""special effects movies"" that I didn't think was outright horrible.The action hero, a beautiful female archaeologist, and her thieving brother go to the ancient city of Hamunaptra and accidentally awaken the Mummy, which will of course destroy the world if they don't stop it.  The major plot lines are the budding romance of the hero and the archaeologist, the competition between these people and a group of American diggers who are also trying to pillage Hamunaptra, and the betrayal of the hero's former side-kick.

It's hard to be scared by a monster when the actors in the movie don't even seem intimidated by it. If you want a serious take on the legend of the Mummy, this isn't for you, but if you don't mind a comedy adventure movie (like Congo) that tries but doesn't come close to being an Indiana Jones film you'll probably be entertained by The Mummy.",The Mummy

It uses every old plot device and cliche from a hundred adventure movies, and stuffs them into two hours of special effects...but does it REALLY well. It's a lot of fun to watch, as long as you can get past that simple fact. There really isn't anything in this movie we haven't seen before, but we've probably never seen it done quite this well.It's very much in the spirit of the Indiana Jones movies (heck, Brendan Fraser really just plays Indy in a different job...and without a hat). I admire Brendan Fraser as an actor, and his performance is definitely one of the best things about The Mummy. The effects were nice too, but personally, I don't think digital effects have gotten to the point where you can make a fully CG character that doesn't look at least a little bit like a cartoon, so the effects didn't impress me all that much. Call me jaded. Besides, effects aren't the reason I go to see a movie. I want to be told an entertaining story.

The most impressive part with respect to the main characters is that this movie is not a Brendan-fest.  The film spends enough time on ALL the main characters, and they all get developed past the point of being scenery. They even get to help fight the bad guy! Imagine! The plot of the movie moves right along, you get a brief background on the mummy, straight and to the point, you meet the main characters, and you're off.  No time wasted, which is just the kind of treat to have in this sort of movie.  If you go to the movies for entertainment, you will enjoy this, and have some laughs, if you go for enlightenment, give it up.

Girls who are looking for Brendan at his best will be a little let down this time around, he's not nearly as pumped and cut as he was for George of the Jungle, and we don't see as much of him exposed, but what can you do?",The Mummy
728,shiro-6,The Mummy is amazing CG coupled with good flow of action,8,8 May 1999,"This movie quite possibly has the best special effects I've ever seen. Although the plot starts out just a bit slow, soon the action gets rolling and provides for a movie which I could actually sit through for over two hours. The action sequences are plentiful, well directed, and exciting, though their effectiveness is slightly clouded by noticable anachronisms (I noticed several guns in the movie which did not exist in 1923). I was also surprised to see, after his numerous comedy movies, Brendan Fraser work very well as an action hero.",The Mummy

730,Destin,What a waste of two hours...,2,8 May 1999,"This movie is just a shame. Nothing about it is even remotely entertaining. It's not scary, and it's not even campy enough to be funny in an Anaconda-esque way. The writing and directing are fit for a straight-to-video flick, yet for some reason millions of dollars were fed to this loser. Somehow, even the expensive sets, costumes and ILM computer effects seem low-rent. So what killed this flick? Maybe it's the characters, one of whom knows how to read heiroglyphics, studies ancient Egyptian cities, memorizes mummy's curses, but has never heard of Pharoah Seti I. Or maybe it's that the initial Egyptian set looks more animated than the ones in Prince of Egypt. Maybe it's that the mummy looks different in every shot, as they switch from dummy mummy to computer effect without checking for similarities. Maybe it's the idiotic bald-dude villain you see ten times more than the mummy. Maybe it's the fact that this bald guy roars like a lion. Maybe it's that no one ever looks like they've been told ""hey, there's a scary computer mummy dude in this shot, so look frightened."" Maybe it's the ""army of the undead"" at the end, who gain and lose weight at random (depending on whether they're obvious guys in suits or obvious digital effects), lurch around like decomposing Jerry's kids and are far less visually effective than the skeletons from Army of Darkness, which cost less than half as much. Maybe it's that I could count down precisely to every predictable, tired ""jump-scene."" Maybe it's the THREE ""funny-drunk"" scenes. Whatever it is, I'm very sorry I wasted two hours on this movie. Forget everything you've heard about this being a Raiders of the Lost Ark clone. There's no way the two movies share even the tiniest bit of DNA.",The Mummy
731,Flyer46299,A very confused movie.,6,10 May 1999,"This movie was a good movie.  Worth the price of admission.  But, I think the writers and director didn't know whether to make a comedy or a horror/action.  Some of the scenes leave you wondering if you should be scared or laughing.  I think they needed to pick one or the other.",The Mummy
732,Goofleen,It was a good movie!!,9,13 May 1999,"It was a good movie.  The beginning did sort of drag a little but without it you would be very lost.  Now, this movie reminded me of watching Indiana Jones and I don't know about you but I love to watch Indiana Jones.  Some of it did drag I will admit but all in all it was a great thing to see.  I don't think that everyone would enjoy it.  Some of the scenes are a bit much, but if you can use special effects why don't you use them.  I thought that it was a great movie and I do encourage anyway  if you like to watch a bit of action with a touch of romance to go watch this movie.  It just depends what kind of person you are I guess.",The Mummy

It also has great lines, set designs, costumes, scenery, action and fighting sequences.  It has Egyptians, Bedouins/Tauregs, American cowboys, French Foreign Legion soldiers, archaeologists, secret 3000 year old societies, you name it. Great characters. (If you're a chick note that nearly all of the good guys are fine as well as talented, and that the female lead is is a very strong character.)",The Mummy
736,Tom-316,A fun old fashioned adventure movie,10,8 May 1999,"This movie was just a lot of fun to watch. To me it had a similarity to the old serials that I used to see at Saturday matinees at a theater in my hometown when I was a kid. There was a lot of cliffhanger moments and the pace of the action was very frantic, especially in the second hour of the film.  The plot is pretty basic and has been done before in other mummy movies, but what distinguishes this film is the wonderful special effects and photography. Industrial Light and Magic did a great job with the computer graphic effects. The thousands of beetles, called scarabs, are particularly frightening as thousands of them devour a body in just a few seconds.The heroine, Rachel Weisz, is very nice to look at and is very appealing. Brendan Fraser does a great job and has a lot of funny one liners in the film. Arnold Vosloo makes a great mummy and has a very ominous appearance. He is perfect in his part.All the sets and props are wonderful and show where part of the 80 million dollar budget was spent.The desert photography was very beautiful, and the effect of the desert sandstorm flowing over the cliffs was particularly impressive.So if you are looking for a fun exciting way to spend two hours, and if you like old fashioned adventure movies, your time will be well spent",The Mummy
737,Tempest-6,A forgettable film,1,8 May 1999,"Even while going in with no high expectations, I felt this movie was an opportunity lost. It could have been the next 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.

I went into the film completely blind as to the plot, etc...I was very surprised to see an action/adventure/comedy film with very good special effects and a feeling not unlike, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".  All the characters were very personable, including the ""bad guys"".  I throughly enjoyed the film and will/have told nearly everyone I know that they should see it if they are in the mood for a very enjoyable time at their local movie theater. Everyone in attendance last night seemed to really enjoy the movie.  I would see it again and being in a business where I see so many movies and have little time to view something a second time,  that is high praise!",The Mummy
739,Unsibaby,A waste of two hours,2,12 May 1999,"Well-written, engaging, hilarious, terrifying, beautiful - all those are words which do *not* describe this movie.

740,true-6,"Great Special effects, and lots of action and suspense a really good thriller",8,8 May 1999,The Mummy was a really good film. I liked the suspense and the thrill it gave me throughout the whole film. Brendan Fraser was great as the adventurous explorer.

741,PnD,FAN-TAS-TIC,9,6 May 1999,"Action packed and good to the last drop, ""The Mummy"" for 1999 was a thrill-ride full of action, special effects, horror, and yes...comedy.  If you liked the Indiana Jones adventures, you're going to LOVE ""The Mummy""Brendan Fraser did well as his role of Rick O'Connell.  Cocky though brave, he made the perfect ""hero"" of the storyRachel Weisz portrayed a headstrong and very knowledgeable (even if a little clumsy) Evelyn.  She doesn't take herself too seriously, though knows what she wants and just how to get it.John Hannah..FUNNY to the bone.  From his sudden (and funny) entrance to the end, he  provides humor and charm to the film.  Delivering lines with the same effect as Harrison Ford in the Indiana Jones films, he kept me smiling. Playing Evelyn's older brother, Jonathan, Hannah gave me my only LOL moment of the film, a little over an hour into the movie.  I'm not known for more than a few smiles while watching a movie, but Hannah's comedic touch almost brought tears to my eyes when he goes out to get the car ready for the others and is confronted by some nasty looking villagers.  Trust me....Brilliant.A 2-hour tour of beautiful scenery and tons of scenes that make you cringe, laugh, gasp, and sit at the edge of your movie theatre seat, ""The Mummy"" is worth the price of admission.",The Mummy

This movie had such a promising premise that it is a crime someone let this be made in such a way.  And all this talk of special effects is absurd.  I felt like I was watching a video game, and all though video games are becoming more and more real life, they are nothing compared to what a movie should be. This movie was bad.",The Mummy

This movie had a great cast of Brendon Fraser, Stephen Dunham, John Hannah, and Jonathan Hyde. A great director (Stephen Sommers) can really be seen.

The old scary story of a curse of the temples of Egypt keeps you interested and informed of what the story is about. I give it two thumbs up.",The Mummy
749,LenV,I was disappointed....,2,8 May 1999,"This movie was nothing like I expected it to be. Indiana Jones it ain't.There are a lot of special effects in this movie. There's bugs that eat you alive, there's skeletons that fight, there's fires aboard ships and there's sand storms that are alive. The best special effect, though, is that everyone running around in the hot deserts of Egypt fighting for their lives DO NOT SWEAT! Nope, not one bead!Save your money and save your time. See something else.",The Mummy
750,Shadows-6,"A fun roller-coaster ride, but mildly unfulfilling and lacking depth.",6,10 May 1999,"An exciting series of action sequences, but with stereo-type cardboard characters that lack depth and sufficient backstory. The effects, while beautiful are too extreme to be believed and lack the majesty and feeling of history of the real Egypt.There are so many good legends, curses and settings in real Egyptology that the computer generated ones used in this film are disappointing. After a while you are just waiting for them to say ""Oh no ! A million computer generated bugs are after us again !""The Indiana Jones films had the same problems and mixed in some actual history and a logical set of threats.This film has booby traps that nobody but an idiot would set off (of course one predictably does just that) and illogical things like mummies that crawl out of the earth where there is no reason to believe they would have been buried.  Also except for the main Mummy the Egyptian priests didn't intend to get loose, those lame boody traps and some killer bugs, there is no real guardians of the terribly overdone mega-treasure. I would have expected it to be looted away to nothing eons ago.",The Mummy
751,Bkalina,"Good, but a ""rip off of style""",7,9 May 1999,"The film industry is running dry when it comes to style, technique, and stories.  ""The Mummy"" is a good film.  I personally found it quite entertaining (I'd say 7 out of 10 stars).  But I'm not making a comment on how entertaining the film was.The director, Stephen Sommers, borrowed the style for the film.  The Mummy starts out very original but as the film progresses it suddenly developed a mood, look, and feel that reminded me of something.  When I thought about it I realized what it was.  The script and directing style slowly turned into the same as Sam Raimi (Evil Dead I, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness).Suddenly the film shifts tracks from an intense horror film where you are on the end of your seat, waiting to get scared and fall in or out of you seat; to a horror film with slap sticky zombie mummies loosing limbs and doing Three Stooges style humor (Ala Evil Dead I & II and Army of Darkness).  At one point a mummy's hand gets chopped off and it crawls around and tries to kill the hero (Brendan Friser).  The film also has the ""magic books"" that raise the dead.  Now normally these characteristics slip into film and you can't say ""Hey that's like in..."" But this film is crammed full of Sam Raimi traits.  All the film needed was a chain saw wheedling Bruce Campbell-isc character and they would be in a position to be sued.Now I'm not saying that the film is not good, it is a very entertaining film.  What I am saying is the following:The film is a step up from Stephen Sommers' last film Deep Rising.If you are a Sam Raimi fan and would be offended by seeing his style of writing directing don't see the Mummy, or see it and complain to all your friends.If you are a Sam Raimi fan and would be pleased to see some one use his style see the film.If you have or are going to see the film, see Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness, or any other Sam Raimi film so you can see the similarities.",The Mummy

The action of the this movie is like ID4 and love story is like Dracula not mention the stars are all beautiful people.This is by far the best combinations for Horror, Action, Comedy and love story.  I really enjoyed it and never once I feel the movie was too long. It's perfect and NOT a moment of dullness.",The Mummy
753,Patzilla,Action all the way..,7,9 May 1999,"This is a great action film, it has the feel of the action films of yesteryear.The special effects prove that this is definitely a modern film though. From the grandeur of Ancient Egypt, to the sandstorms and plagues of the bible, the effects were flawless.One nice point,  what could have been some really gory scenes where the mummy attacks, were left to the imagination instead of trying to shock the audience.This is definitely a film that I will recommend to my friends.",The Mummy
754,Cerulean-8,Special effects...and little else,3,9 May 1999,"There's little to like about ""The Mummy"" especially after the letdown I felt when going to see it. While the trailer was extremely intriguing the plot fell way short of expectations. The cardboard cutout characters were flat and lifeless. The actors were picked merely to fit set molds, including the witty adventurer, the ever degraded middle-easterners and the damsel in distress. Plot points and foreshadowing were even part of the dialogue, a sure sign of an attempt at ""PG-13"" campiness which sadly will only be appreciated by those 13 and under.The special effects are good, but not as good as I would have expected and they certainly do nothing to save the rest of the film which was barely a step above unwatchable. The movie is a barely disguised Keystone Cops adventure which might have been slightly more interesting if it weren't for truly different and interesting films that have already been made like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Fifth Element.""I suspect the masses will enjoy this movie in large numbers because it seems most are programmed to like movies that have expensive trailers, computer-generated special effects and enormous budgets...the current defining principles of Hollywood. So see ""The Mummy"" if you must but prepare to be disappointed.",The Mummy
755,Kat-97,An excellent combination of genres.,8,10 May 1999,"If you like different types of movies, you will love this.  Indiana Jones, Dracula,and any Mel Brooks film, rolled into one.  Fast paced and exciting it is a must see, even for those with older children, if they can sit through it.  A bit long but worth it.Most people will enjoy this film not just for the action, but also for the plot.  Characters that grow are an up and coming concept in Hollywood and this movie stays with the idea.  Interesting twist in the story and three dimensional characters make this a filling movie.  And a great way to prepare for the summer movies.",The Mummy

I usually don't see movies in theaters if I can experience them more comfortably at home, but it was worth the extra money and time to go to see this on a big screen.  It is very ""...Lost Ark""-ish, though Brendon Fraser isn't as handsome as Harrison Ford. Of course, I'm 40, and the 20 year-olds out there would probably disagree. Still...he'll do!  Plenty of action and interesting scenery. Well worth the couple of hours and the money, which is all I ask of a movie at a theater.",The Mummy
757,Revolvo Spinz,Bury this movie fast!,2,9 May 1999,"Quite possibly one of the poorest movies I have ever seen and I have seen quite a few in my timeWhat an all too simple story. It's a weak excuse to throw some special effects around which surprisingly weren't that good. When I saw in the credits that ILM was doing them I was ready to be blown away. Mediocre is what comes to mind when I think of the effects. A few of them are impressive but when it comes to ILM most people expect eye-popping as a standard. In one scene, the mummy who is slowly regenerating, has scabs and scars on portions of his face. For some reason they were unnecessarily computer generated. And to make it worse, they seemed to floating off his face as the effects personnel did a poor job matching the shape of the scars to the mummy's face. Quite a few times there are thousands of bugs, be it scarabs, locusts, or flies buzzing or crawling around. The sheer number is a bit impressive but what distracted me was that the bugs were shiny for some reason forcing me to realize that they were in fact computer generated.The movie's script is filled with one-liners that just aren't funny. It doesn't help when most of them are said by the leading man Brenden Frasier who for the entire movie either needs cough medicine because his voice is forcefully scratchy or curls his lip as if he had some peanut butter stuck to the front of his teeth.In addition to a poor movie, it didn't help that I was surrounded by the most annoying people...ever. At countless points, two gentlemen in front of me burst out loud with an ear-splitting laugh just screaming of stupidity. It wasn't only at the parts where the movie tried to be funny either. When one of the characters just simply got on his camel, they burst out loud with a roar of a laugh rocking back and forth in their seats. And just for the record, many other people besides me were angry at these men (oafs?). Two people behind me got up during the middle of the movie after another one of the idiots' laughs. Coincidence? I think not...I would much rather have stayed home staring at a blank wall for a couple of hours than have gone to this trash. This movie is what gives adventure/blockbuster movies a bad name.",The Mummy
758,Bruce-98,Great non-stop action movie,9,10 May 1999,"It's one of the most fun movies I've seen since the first Indiana Jones movie.  It is filled with non-stop action, well placed humor and likeable characters.  It has, as most movies do, that unbelievable action or two, but still a fun movie.  It was also devoid of nudity, sex and extreme foul lanaguage.  I am a big movie goer and I think it's one of the best movies I've seen since Saving Private Ryan.",The Mummy
759,Triantos,"Wow, this movie was really lame!",3,10 May 1999,"This movie was totally lame.  The writers couldn't figure out whether to make it scary and exciting, or funny, or some mixture of both.  The effects were great, but after seeing The Matrix, there was nothing special about The Mummy's.It might be a fun movie for 12 year olds, but this is not the kind of thing that'll hold me over until Phantom Menace",The Mummy

I would recommend that if you haven't seen this movie yet, you do so immediately!  And if you have seen it, and you love it, see it again.  If you did see it, and you didn't like it, that's your problem.  The Mummy, in my opinion, was better than The Phantom Menace.",The Mummy
762,Tzeentch,"It was good, but...",8,11 May 1999,"The Mummy was a pretty good movie, but there were some problems with it. First and foremost, it should have been rated R.  It could have been a much better movie had the creators tried to make it R instead of PG-13.  The intro was good, but I think a little more info about Imhotep's past would have been nice.  Also, what in the hell was Rick (the main guy) doing in the Middle East? When I first heard about The Mummy, I heard that it WOULD be rated R, and that it would be a powerful epic, which is what I was hoping for.  The final story was pretty good but could have used some work (well, the director was also the screenwriter).This movie had great potential for being a not so typical horror movie that actually had a plot, but it tripped and fell at the end.  The creators should have tried for a powerful, mind-blowing epic and not a run of the mill action/horror flick.",The Mummy

Though similar in style to the Indiana Jones movies, The Mummy was still captivating and fun to watch.Take note of the wonderful scenery and special effects. It is truly monumental.The actors - mostly unknowns - were perfectly cast and put on a great performance.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.",The Mummy
764,Jen Graeler,Where's the beef?,5,12 May 1999,"Obviously, advertising for the Mummy promises state-of-the-art special effects and edge-of-your-seat action.  I entered the theater with re-newed faith in the movie industry, as the last film I caught was 'The Matrix.' What did I find?First of all, the special effects in the Mummy showed a complete lack of imagination.  How many times can they show a moving skeleton?  How many times can scarabs appear in swarms out of nowhere?  Or bees, or locusts? The mummy himself was pretty cool when he first came to life, I admit, but they could have done even more with his appearance, since you get to see him up close many times.Aside from the effects, the central problem here is plot, or rather lack of one:  a cookie-cutter storyline, down to the last scene where the hero kisses the girl and they ride off into the sunset (though on camels here instead of horses).  I'll admit it was funny, very funny in parts, but I didn't go in expecting a comedy.  Movies like 'Scream' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' could pull off making you laugh, and placing you at the edge of your seat at the same time.  This movie completely fails at that, and comes off as a complete Adventure-movie spoof.  Even 'Tremors' was better at creating tension.  Because 'The Mummy' seems to be continually making fun of itself, you never feel the wonderful suspense that made movies like 'Speed' and 'T2' superior action flicks.All in all, I'd say the movie's greatest strengths come from the comedic writing, and Brendan (who is in no way responsible for this movie's shortcomings, by the way) continually beating the s**t out of this little twerp that keeps showing up at key turning points in the film.If you must investigate the Mummy's curse, I suggest a matinee.",The Mummy
765,c-stone,Breakdown of the elements,7,12 May 1999,"The Mummy squeaks in as an acceptable blockbuster. Humor, good timing, off-timing and recurring horror all come together producing a full cinema experience.The romance is a little hokey, but not ridiculously so. I thoroughly enjoyed the modesty of the lead female character. The character, Evelyn Carnarvon, was delightful, smart and a lady.Brendan Fraser once again has chosen the role of a lovable leading man. He delivers the hero talents too, lots of punches thrown and knockin' around bad guys - both living and dead.Special effects? Very well done. Spooky stuff.Story line? Mmmmmmmm... There's a gaping free fall within the movie when the goal or goals are lost. But we, the audience, are along for this ride and we're all in this together. We're still having an acceptable night at the movies.About the humor... much of it was great. But I was upon saying the words to my husband as Brendan Fraser said my line. Granted, I'm a funny person, but that line must have been waiting there to be said. I struggle with it being a trite line or I'm a witty person of the same caliber as the screenwriter. (grin) Other than that and one completely flat line delivered by the character Beni deep into the film, the humor was good.This is a remake of an old horror film, and is ""as good as can be expected.""

His portrayal of Imhotep is fascinating and intriguing with a definite screen presence.  Being a fan of the horror classics, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie twice!!The scenery and the amount of work that went into this production was extensive and added richly to the film.  The computerized imagery was fascinating and it very much added to the visual effects of the movie.The soundtrack for The Mummy is a mind-movie in itself with the flavors of Egyptian sounds and the scoring of the soundtrack added just the right touch to the various scenes involving the different characters.As for myself, I can't wait until this movie is available on video and I've just ordered the soundtrack.

I guess it is meant to be a mixture of Indiana Jones and old-school horror movies with more special effects, but it doesn´t even come close to Quatermain. Bad actors, poor dialogues and a mummy that moves like Terminator. I only rated it a 2 because of the first ten minutes.",The Mummy

Most of the monsters these days look so cheesy, it's laughable, and they make up for it, with blood and gore. The scarabs, the mummy himself, plus all those horrid mummy servants of his, were a joy to watch.  I've seen it 3 times, and I still jump at certain points of the movie. This is one I will have in my video library.",The Mummy

Not interesting.  Not sexy.  I hated both the main characters intensely.  And I love all kinds of movies.  I love things like City of Lost Children as well as old Audrey Hepburn movies.  I can enjoy something as stupid as Phenomenon as well as something brilliant like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.  I love Hollywood--things like Face-Off or Independence Day. . .  I am usually very positive about movies I see.  But unless you are a complete imbecile, there is NOTHING in this movie that will entertain you.  Beware The Mummy.",The Mummy

As i watched this movie i had a feeling that all the actors and actresses had a blast making this movie.  and that makes for a fun filled movie.  i was impressed with this one and i will stick by my guns when anyone disses this flick.  Any time i can go to a movie and be entertained i feel good and that is exactly what this movie was FUN  8 out of 10,The Mummy
774,PAJ-4,Neither funny nor scary...not good at all!,3,4 July 1999,"A film about THE Mummy should either be a Boris Karloff white knuckle, terror movie or an Abbott & Costello - type comedy. This film failed miserably at being either either. (Only the Indiana Jones type movies can successfully combine excitement, adventure and humour - simply because they were the first genre to be successful at it).The acting in The Mummy was ATROCIOUS.   John Hannah, what were you thinking of, man? I gave the film 3/10 purely because of the effects, which were excellent and which soaked up 95% of the budget I would imagine! However, this film is proof positive that computers alone cannot create a good movie.Give it a miss, or if you must wait until it's on Cable!",The Mummy

If you like a cheesy, not too taxing film, with a flash hero, beautiful girl, 'funny' man, super powerful villain and sad, pitiful side-kick, that follows the age-old good against evil plot, then you'll find this is a must see film. If on the other hand, you're not, then it still is a reasonable film to see with respect to the great effects and a tie-in with one of the great horror classics.",The Mummy

Perhaps a bullwhip, fedora and Harrison Ford?This film was blatently written to be Indy 4 (or should have been).  There were characters such as John Hannah who could just as easily been Marcus Brody from the Indy trilogy.The American team that they were competing against could have been the Nazi's from the other films.Other 'trademarks' were the occurance of the ""swarm"" (snakes, bugs, rats and now scarabs).  To top it all off, at the end there was even the classic Indy dive under the door.Other than that a good film, but I was just waiting for the ""de de de da, da de da"" (doesn't work without a sound card) :-)",The Mummy

While there may not have been enough sex or blood-and-guts for some folk, I feel this is one of the best ""scary"" movies ever.  I prefer to be scared a la ""Rear Window"" -- what is imagined is better than what is seen.  ""The Mummy"" stirs up emotions while making one feel a part of the action -- or within the whirlwind of action as the Mummy runs amok.  Can't wait for the sequel.

I went in expecting a horror film and was riveted to the screen for the next two hours. This movie has it all: action, adventure, romance, comedy, drama, suspense, horror, foreign language subtitled. The special effects were incredible, putting even Star Wars: The Phantom Menace to shame (interesting, because both movies' effects were produced by Industrial Light and Magic...). Imhotep makes Jar Jar Binks look incredibly fake. The  Jerry Goldsmith score fits the movie well, adding to the Egyptian feel. Definitely in my top ten all-time favorite list!",The Mummy
786,fvjont2p,"Excellent trailers, terribly disappointing",1,4 October 1999,"This looked really good in the commercials, but did the actual movie ever suck!

787,d4n4,Painful.,2,8 August 2000,"The first few minutes were enticing; exotic costumes, language, and sets weaved nicely together to create a plausibly depicted ancient Egypt. But then *flash!* Three thousand years later...We're treated to shameless silliness as a bunch of slapstick, clever-line-dropping, cut-from-movie-dough characters annoy us through a cartoonish exploration of an ancient city and the accidental awakening of an (ooh) fearsome mummy.We're treated to numerous repeated, forehead-slapping devices like roaring matches between the beefcake hero and the poorly-computer-animated undead; the endless supply of hapless, gutless, yelping sidekick characters; the ditzy, studious, utterly incomprehensible female lead.Perhaps worst, we're treated to a faux-1920s setting populated by unapologizingly 1990s dialogue (""Like I've never heard that before!"") among other blatant anachronisms. Why not just set it in the present, I wonder? Oh yeah, Indiana Jones.The best summary, I suppose, is given by the beefcake hero: ""Save the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world.""

When we rented it, I hadn't even planned on watching it...I was more interested in doing my homework.  But once I started watching it, I was hooked!!  I watched it the next morning, and I went out and bought it the next day.  Now I can watch it whenever I want to, which is great because it is a great movie and I can't get enough of Brendan Fraser!!",The Mummy

Finally a mature role for Brandon Frasier. i really enjoyed watching him in this one. he had the exact same style as he did in his other movies, but they were useful to keep the movie going. One person i would like to see more of is Oded Fahr, who played the mysterious Ardeth Bay. he just added a sense of fear and danger to the scenes that he was in. Overall, a wonderful movie!!",The Mummy
790,bnd-2,Lots Of Fun If You Don't Take It (Or Yourself) Too Seriously,8,13 December 1999,"I put off seeing this movie for months because I let myself get turned off by the bad reviews that were given to it by serious film buffs (the kind of people who talk oh-so-knowingly about ""genre"" and are probably boring as hell in real life). Finally saw it ... and guess what? I liked it!The movie is misclassified as horror. It's really a comedy with high-grade special effects. I've seen plenty of comments here comparing it to Indiana Jones. I had that impression, too. That's one of the things I liked about it. The acting's not great, but the actors are cute. The dialogue is corny. However, there are some surprises and the special effects are certainly eye-catching.If you like your mummies slow, stick with the classic stuff. But, if you enjoy something a little off the wall, this movie is a fun way to spend a couple of hours.",The Mummy

Great Actors, amazing special effects, Funny, edgy, with protagonists who truly are. Rick O'Connel is a true hero, a plain dealer. We don't see  too many of those lately. Evie is thankfully so much more than the Hood Ornament we usually see in adventure films, one that usually tends to get replaced in the sequel. Gladly Rachel Weisz will be in The Mummy 2. Her character is irreplaceable.",The Mummy
796,kk254,"Many drawbacks in the scenario, only the special effects deserve credit.",3,18 February 2000,"The major thing that I didn't like in this movie is the way it presents Ancient Egyptians and their civilisation. They present them like people who were worshipping evil and exercising black magic. Totally wrong. Ancient Egyptians were lively people, who believed in Good and loved good life. In fact their whole life was considered as a fight against the forces of darkness and the chaos. They were preserving the bodies of the Pharaohs and other important people, so that they could live in a sense forever.Of course, the resurrection of a dead to a deadly beast is a potentially very good starting point for a horror/action story/movie. But this is not enough. It is easy to spoil everything if you are careless about the details. And I explain. The city of Hamunaptra is totally fictitious. There was never such a city, and especially a city of the Dead. Priest Imhotep (later the mummy) is the bad, evil guy. But in the Ancient Egyptian history there is a priest Imhotep, who was considered a very wise man and he did many things for the benefit of Egypt (unfortunately, I don't remember right now many details about him). Later, his fame was such that he was even worshipped as a god. Definitely, the choice of the name was awkward. Close to the end of the movie, the Book of the Dead is being used, presented as a secret book of black magic. Although there IS a Book of the Dead, it has nothing to do with the way it is presented in the movie. In fact, the Book of the Dead accompanied every Pharaoh, it has been found and it is a guide for the dead Pharaoh about how he will be judged by the Gods in the other world and other things. It has nothing to do with black magic. Concerning the second book the heroes use, that does not exist even by name. And all these strange names of the Gods, where have they found them? Non of them exists in the Egyptian mythology!If you don't know anything at all about Ancient Egypt, these things will pass unnoticed. You might even like them! But seriously, if you have read something about Ancient Egypt, then you notice them, and they are very annoying, spoiling much of the fun. The movie refers to another, Hollywood Egypt, not the real one. And since the movie fails to have a realistic background, it fails to entertain (at least it failed with me).But these are not the only drawbacks of the movie. Brendan Fraser is not convincing as an action hero, Rachel Weisz tries unsuccessfully to be the female and for the rest...So, to conclude, you might ask if I didn't like anything in this movie at all. Not quite, after all I gave it a 3. The effects were amazing, maybe the only decent thing in this movie. I think that they are the main, if only, making it such a success. Therefore, the only one that deserves full credit, are the Silicon Graphics.",The Mummy
797,kibz,A must for Indiana Jones fans,10,18 February 2000,"I thought this movie was really good it was a good escape from reality for 2 hours and is a must for Indiana Jones fans. Brendan Fraser was at his very best no doubt about that playing the mummy slayer Rick. Rachel Weisz played the damsel in distress really good so did John Hannah whom played her brother he added some great humour to the movie. This movie is a must for all you adventure types you can,t go wrong. I forgot to mention the guy who played the mummy Arnold Vosloo he does not say much but he put forward to me you don,t mess with him. And watch out for the bugs!",The Mummy
798,providence_19,The movie sustained my attention with the light humor and vigorous performance by the lead actor and actress.,9,29 March 2000,"The choice of cast was excellent as the beautiful heroine was a cross between the damsel in distress and the strong Cleopatra. She had a sense of mystery and danger even in her portrayal of a librarian. Brendan Fraser was as handsome as ever and provided the element of farce to the genre of horror and I believe that was a key element in keeping the audiences attention. It breaks the confines of a horror and brinks on adventure, romance. All in all it is uplift for dull day and a visual feast as both leads light up the screen with their chemistry.",The Mummy
799,Mike Philippens,A true dissapointement,1,7 June 2000,"After seeing the trailers which only showed the great F/X and computer wizzardry they put into the movie, the movie itself was a great disappointement. The characters are poor, the story thin and historically it is next to blasphamy. I was wondering what audience this was aimed at: when you cut the 'scary' scenes, it would be a good movie for kids! As an adult, I felt tested as to howmuch I could take. This movie is (in my opinion) another example where the makers thought they could get away with some nice computer F/X. But they seem to forget that these things only support a movie, not carry it. You still need a good story and some convincing actors to play it. I'm not against computer F/X, but they can't make up a poorly put together movie. Maybe the plot worked in the 30's, but we're not in Kansas anymore...One good thing after seeing this movie: I didn't rent it (my brother did...) - so I didn't waste any money.",The Mummy

If you hear about the title and the story of ""The mummy"", you expect a horror-movie with a lot of dead people and a lot of blood. If you expect that, you will be disappointed. ""The mummy"" is a classic adventure film, with some very funny moments in it. You are able to see, that the actors had a lot of fun during the shooting. If you are looking for two hours full of fun and adventure: choose ""the mummy"".",The Mummy

This movie has it all: action, humor, romance and of course a great cast. Before The Mummy I had never heard of Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, Stephen Dunham and Corey Johnson. And now I think they are great actors. For anyone who thinks this is a copy of one of the Indiana Jones films: it is not true. Indiana Jones wasn't about Mummies!",The Mummy
802,weeg1,"It has become one of my top ten. I quote, so this could be a spoiler.",8,5 August 2000,"This movie has become one of my favorites.  I used to stay up late to watch the old mummy movies when I was a kid.  Ever since then I've been intrigued by the whole ancient egyptian thing.  Now, this movie does get down right ridiculous towards the end, but if I wanted reality I would sit on my front porch and watch my neighbors mow their lawn (for free.)  As ridiculous as it gets, the acting is really good.  The humor is contemporary, and so out of place; but I'm willing to make that leap for the sake of a good laugh.Here's were I start to spoil it a bit.  I really got to say that I thought the acting was really authentic.  I have never seen anyone stutter as convincingly as Rick when he was giving Evie the tools he stole - and the look on his face...he really looked nervous.  In fact the facial expressions were really bang on for nearly everyone.  The evil smile of Vasloo was perfect.  When he did the plane swallowing sand/body wave thing...that was wierd, but cool.  He was totally into it.  Like an evil dude would be.  In all fairness, The mumbled stutters Evie forced out when the claw guy asked her for the map sounded very real.  They could rival Rick's tool gift stutters.  Speaking of real, how do you make it look like someone is running into a wall full speed, head first? I don't know, but they do.This movie had a nice amount of humor sprinkled throughout.  Some of the best lines you should hear are...""sounds like.....bugs.""  The facial really did it for me on that one.  I was surprised how funny Fraser could be.  The air kiss was a hoot.  ""That happens alot around here"" -was well placed. Other great lines are...""what's that God awful stench?-Oh"", also ""You don't have any children""-""I might some day"", and ""Wait here I'll go get help."" This is the kind of humor that, I (being intelligent yet silly) can laugh at over and over. They picked the right people for the roles in this movie.  Benny was a total weasel.  I hope I don't offend him, but this guy yelled weasel from his sandals to his hat.  His voice, his lines, his stance, his smile- he was the perfect weasel.  Jonathan (the brother) was great.  There wasn't a moment I didn't believe this guy.  Speaking of guys how many good looking men can you fit in one movie?  I counted at least four.  The magi leader was a babe. (Also, I appreciated that they spoke Egyptian were appropriate.)  Now if you're talking babe material- truthfully I first saw the movie because it had mummy in the title and I knew Fraser (God's gift to us women) was in it. But- the last four times I saw it were mostly for Vasloo.  Where did this guy come from and does he have any brothers?  Yow-za!  You gotta envy Evie when she has Rick(a modern John Wayne with a splash of Tom Hanks) and Imohtep (a gorgeous face on top of an 'ouch' body) fighting over her.I heard about the sequal and I'm definitely gonna see it, but one thing...according to the films at the Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian), they don't remove your heart during mummification.",The Mummy

The battle scenes and the scene where the army of mummies were coming towards the pyramid was amazing, and the sound is incredible you feel like your in the movie theater.

It is a mix of reality and fantasy with humour and even cartoonish elements. That said, such adventure yarns, however improbable they may seem, need to be grounded in as much reality as possible. But how much is enough? A good balance is represented in this story of a cursed being resurrected but eventually defeated, by supernatural elements.Before proceeding further here are the things that always rankle me whenever I watch the movie. Trivial perhaps, but it's usually the little things that have such an effect. I must note that these things may have been discussed in a review already but I have not tried to go through all of them, or were perhaps a part of the old discussion board, so excuse me if I repeat old points.First of all, the name, which is not just about this movie but more striking here. We have accepted these tales for a long time as being about a mummy. But it is really about a bandaged corpse because Imhotep was never mummified. So why is he chasing canopic jars of organs for regeneration if he was buried alive? Was he mummified later? This is never explained or even postulated, and seems unlikely if they found a 'juicy' corpse, with little evidence of wrappings remaining, compared to old movie depictions..Secondly, it has always bothered me when you see Rick drop from the platform with the rope around his neck. Not because of the implied violence, but from the suggestion that despite the full weight of his body being jerked by the rope around his neck, he suffered no injury or even after effects of what is really a type of body trauma, usually fatal, far worse than being tossed around later by resurrected priests/bodyguards of Imhotep, but the cartoonish element makes more sense with the latter type of violence. This spoils efforts at some reality credibility early on. It would have made more sense, and even logic, if not suspense and excitement, for Evy to have had him cut loose just before the platform lever was pulled.Thirdly, it is made clear that Evy can both read hieroglyphics and understand the ancient Egyptian tongue spoken by Imhotep, even to the point of correcting a translation by Beni. So how come she never spoke directly to Imhotep when given the chance, such as at their first encounter? Maybe fear at the beginning but what about later?Lastly, see, only a few trivial things, but these can be annoying at times, we come to Winston. An old war vet suffering from survivor guilt and now an alcoholic hanging out in a remote outpost is a great cliche for this type of movie. But, remember this is 1926, not 1966, so why does an ex-RFC pilot from World War I in 1926, only eight years, not forty years, after the war ended, look like someone's lovable grandpa who would have been too old to fly a decade earlier. He really should have been played by someone in their late 20s/early 30s, but the cliche and poignancy of his sacrifice would be lost. The imagery works in the movie but makes no sense in terms of the historicity of the time period used.So it's only a few little things and many movies have these, with some dismissed as plot holes. But these are obviously the types of little things that could/should have been done differently, although one can only presume decisions were made for the story purposes. As for 'mummy' vs. 'bandaged corpse', this is a matter of semantics beyond this movie and making them synonymous can be accepted as part of pop culture. But does it seem odd nevertheless? So, was Imhotep mummified later? He must have been in order to explain organs in canopic jars, but the punishment and scratches on the lid of the sarcophagus suggest other wise. So, do we treat anything in a sarcophagus in ancient Egypt as a 'mummy'?Beyond these minor points the story is fast paced and holds up as a great tale of adventure being one of the best to come out of Hollywood in a long time and certainly up there with Indiana. After all, we have too few such movies for the adventure loving viewer.Finally, with another comparison to Indiana Jones there is a classic cliche that too often strains credibility but will ever be with us. Take the fourth Indiana Jones as an example, Near the end we have our heroic survivors stranded in a remote place reached after great risk to life and limb, and facing a very dangerous journey back. However, like so many such movies the return journey is always assumed to be easy and simple and never depicted. We then inevitably find our heroes safe and sound back home. It seems all adventure movies have dangerous journeys to destinations but never from. At least here with The Mummy we end with them setting out on their return journey, suggesting it will go smoothly, but not knowing for sure until the sequel that they are safe.Well, after 20+ years I finally got those things out. As before, despite such minor annoyances, inherent in most movies anyway, we have an adventure classic that will be in the top ten of adventure movies for a long time to come.",The Mummy
820,faygo94,Awesome!,10,28 February 2007,"This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.The plot was great, the special effects were great, the music was great, it was overall great. I love Egypt and I loved this movie. For all of you people who thought it was ridiculous... bug off. Even though it IS impossible for a mummy to come back to life, it is just a movie people, and for all of you Egyptians and Egyptologists out there, It is a movie. It is not real! Do not be offended of this movie just because it is about an evil Egyptian mummy.I was reading a book by egyptologist Zahi Hawass and he completely insulted both of the movies. I just want him to know I respect him but he needs to chill out.",The Mummy
821,Becks1987,Brilliant Fun !!!!!!,10,24 November 2001,I thought that this was an amazing film with good special effects and excellent acting from all involved. Brendan Fraser is brilliant as Rick O'Connel as is Rachel Weisz as Evelyn. John Hannah spices up the comedy side of things while Arnold Vosloo makes an awesome bad guy! I thought the storyline was excelllent and the dialogue between the characters helps to make this so. I gave this film 10 out of 10.,The Mummy
822,lyndasheen,Great film a real classic of the future,10,30 August 2002,"I have looked at all the comments of this film the good and the bad, and there are over 700 of them.It was the best film of the year, fantastic special effect by John Berton and ILM, great direction and stunt work, and all the actors gave they're charactors credability, expecially Kevin j O'Conner and Arnold Vosloo, they were very good at being the baddies. Brendon Frasier as the hero brought the quality of an action man to the film, as did Oded Frer, and  Rachel was the best choice for a heroine,the right mix of brains and dissiness. I also liked the ""tounge in cheek"" humour which gave it a lift between the scares.To those of you who wote such negative things ""get a life"". This was entertainment at its best, acton, adventure, romance. It will become a classic and stand the test of time, like the old one has and still does.
I have watched both films over 50 times and know every scene. So I know both these films are great.",The Mummy
823,x_beckii_x,Excellent film!,10,16 August 2008,"This film is definitely one of my favourites.Brendan Fraser did a brilliant job as Rick, he was obviously cut out for the action adventure types, managing not to take himself to seriously but still play a character who isn't just in there for comic effect. Rachel Weisz's Evy undergoes a big transformation over the film, going from nervous librarian to brave mummy-killer, yet still doing the whole thing with a ladylike dignity and propriety, and is a believable heroine, whilst John Hannah is funny and the right amount of annoying as the gambling older brother Jonathan, providing comic relief and helping the plot along. Beni, the annoying, 'friend' of Rick's from the Foreigh Legion also offers us laughs, whilst still being frustrating and almost creepy.The other characters in the film also live up to expectation, with Arnold Vosloo's performance as Imhotep both frightening and intriguing, and provide a film which is both exciting and humorous, mixing the right amount of 'horror' with laughs and action. The special effects of the film were strikingly amazing, and painted a near-believable picture of a mummy out for revenge.",The Mummy
824,nour1990,Action,8,24 May 2008,"Its not a scary movie at all but the action is no doubt and all the actors fit perfectly in their respective roles. Oded Fehr for the medjai, Brendan Fraser for Rick O' Connell, Rachel Weisz for the beautiful Evie, Arnold Vosloo for the evil Imhotep and Patricia Velásquez for Imhotep's love interest and for great comic relief this film have John Hannah who plays Evie's funny but rich greedy Jonathon Carnahan. I watched this movie just yesterday and believe me or not that was the 18th time I watched this movie because ya all see new movie releases but if you catch up with this movie in your TV than believe me this will never keep ya all bored. 9/10. My score. Because the most interesting characters in this film is Rick O'Connell and Evie played by Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz respectively.",The Mummy

826,Grand_Admiral_Thrawn,The Last Great Adventure Film,10,23 September 2009,"Don't get me wrong, we have had lots of great movies since '99, but I really feel that this is the last one where it was just 10 for 10 great. And it was a great way to end the 90's, which I still believe to be one of the best movie decades; we knew how to make great movies and we knew how to make great trailers for those great movies--not just rapidly flashing scenes with drums and clashing and building violins, but REAL trailers edited to perfection with great music.""The Mummy"" just packs it all; from Adventure to Horror to Fantasy to Drama to Comedy, and in my humble opinion, it succeeds superbly in all five genres. It is just such a FUN movie! The sites (and sights), the sound design, the CGI (while I won't say it's perfect), and, of course, Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece of a score which can take Alan Silvestri's for ""The Mummy Returns"" to the cleaners any day of the week.While ""The Mummy"" was a blockbuster, it is sadly one of those unappreciated movies. Shortly after its release is when movies began to take a turn for the worse and become darker, and for what ever crackbutt reason, darker is what the American Audience wants. Audiences just want movies where everyone dies (a lot of the time including the hero(es)), the music is heavily synthesized, and the plot is simplistic.""The Mummy"" is an epic adventure from beginning to end. And I can only hope that our movies return to this movie-type some day soon. While I do like ""The Mummy Returns"", it was a little too silly for me. And ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor""? No comment. The first one just captures the fun-ness that movies are SUPPOSED to be; a movie that grabs you out of your world so you almost feel as if you're IN the movie (he said, at the risk of sounding either cheezy or loony), very much in the tradition of ""Jurassic Park"" and its sequel.It's just truly a classic, and will hopefully remain so long enough to see a day when it is appreciated again.",The Mummy

829,Rohmega,Good fun action adventure Film with superb special effects,8,26 January 2015,"**** MILD SPOILERS **** The Mummy is one of the most fun and entertaining good action adventure horror films that can be seen over and over again. This film is best described by the word ""fun"", there isn't much not to like and the film is overall well put together. The films starts out with a very promising layout of ancient Egypt in the time of Pharaoh Seti I. The special effects shown are very good and are far better than ""normal"" blockbusters of that time, the sequel, The Mummy Returns (2001), has far worse special effects, but is still an entertaining watch. The acting starts out a bit weak and the delivery is not too convincing for the setup of the story, luckily, the rest of the film improves greatly on this. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz gave a good performance and Brendan Fraser as O'Connel just works. The comic relief is given by Kevin O'Connor as Beni and John Hannah as Jonathan, who both do an excellent job. O'Connor's role in aiding Imhotep is also very refreshing from the generic ""funny guy"" who is ""just there"", he has a purpose and never feels unneeded. One of the most hilarious scenes is when Beni tries to complement Imhotep on making a giant wall of sand to kill O'Connel. ""I love this whole sand trick... it was beautiful... bastard"", I laugh every time I see this scene, especially since Fraser was perplexed they kept that scene in the Film. The action plays a very important role in The Mummy and refreshingly, it's done well and the camera-work is smooth and the editing doesn't dull the experience. Many blockbusters today make the mistake of editing too much, making a cut at the moment of impact, taking all the energy out of it. In The mummy, the camera lets you see when a hit is a hit without shaking the camera like a little child who has to get a flu-shot. The camera angles are wide and there is never annoying zoom-ins or weird close-up-and-then-pan-to-more-action-shots. Everything is just good and solid. What makes this movie timeless, however unintuitive, are the special effects. Watching it, even in 2015, will not make you look at some effects and laugh about how bad they are. There are few classics that hold up this well to time. The half ""juicy"" (funny scene) mummy is ever as convincing and terrifying now as it was back then, a very impressive feat., It isn't intrusive or overdone, at the same time, the special effects are not the only thing that hold this movie up to being a very good experience. The music is very well done and is perfect for creating the atmosphere which makes this Films believable and exciting. Watching the Film with Brendan Fraser's commentary is also a must, it makes re-watching the Film refreshing and it makes you laugh at even more scenes because you will remember Fraser's commentary the nth time you watch it. The Mummy is a good Film, it knows what it is and is not afraid to sometimes mock itself. A must watch for when you want to see a very entertaining and excellent Film. Don't nit-pick every aspect of the movie and then, even if you have seen it 10 times before, it remains one of the best action Films in the action/adventure genre. Don't expect it to be a story without plot holes and just sit back and enjoy.",The Mummy

I know is a loosely adaptation from the classic 1932 horror film, but it is a spectacle, rowdy adventure and supernatural horror all crammed into a raucous two hours of high-testosterone special-effects filmmaking! Arnold Vosloo is the perfect choice for the Mummy.",The Mummy
832,supimsatan,Still great in 2017,8,20 August 2017,"Amazingly a lot of action, adventure and some fun in it!From beginning to end, The Mummy is very simple, and not one second of it is incomprehensible to a young audience member. The pacing is great; the buildup to the resurrection is actually a great success, and the adventures that ensue are horrifying, hilarious, and adventurous. Brendan Frasier gives a very nice performance as Rick O'Connell, and Rachael Weisz is just as good as Evey. For what he's given, Arnold Vosloo is very menacing as Imhotep, and Oded Fehr's character could have used more screen time to allow us to appreciate him more -- though plenty of that is in the second. The action flows, and is shot very well. The special effects are really good, and I don't think there has ever been a cooler-looking mummy. Jerry Goldsmith's score is decent enough to warrant a buy, though not nearly as sweeping as it could have been, it's still a decent collection of music",The Mummy

The special effects were, without a doubt, excellent, as was the story and the acting. I highly recommend this film whether or not you're a Brendan Fraser fan as this is a definite change of direction for his career. I, quite frankly, did not consider him an action/adventure actor until I saw ""The Mummy"". He's a far more versatile actor than I had previously thought. Rachel Weisz was very good (this was the first film of hers I had seen), and Patricia Velasquez did surprisingly well for being a prior supermodel. All in all a great film, one that should be added to any movie collection.",The Mummy

But Oded Fehr and Arnold Vosloo(as the antagonist)could be better.And the special effects are excellent. The mummy is really well-done and some other special effects are amazing too.And Stephen Sommers, the director, does a good work. He has the talent.

But what I didn't understand about the movie was, didn't the guy with glasses disintegrate or something like that, instead of him disappearing? Plus, the story line was great, the special effects were sensational, and finally, the actors did better than their best. They did ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!

The movie was quite well done well directed and well written as well, as had an excellent cast of people. I think that the History was accurate although I don't know for sure. I like how they put Egyptian in there and finding out how to the kill the mummy was a little more complicated than just shooting him like O' Connol was trying to do.

To me the movie moved fast enough to be interesting but not so much so that I couldn't keep up and enjoy the other aspects. I absolutely loved the special effects. No expense were spared.

844,brendanfam,Great fun for the whole family,10,3 December 2015,"The Mummy is an action-adventure film in the vein of classics such as Raiders of The Last Ark and The Goonies. It is a movie filled with moments scary enough to make your skin crawl, but in equal amounts moments that JUST make your heart warm. The chemistry between the cast is amazing, especially between the hunky leading actor Brendan Fraser and the ever beautiful Rachel Weisz, who both give an outstanding performance that carries the movie forward as an adventure film with a lot of heart for the whole family. The pacing of the movie is great, in no small part thanks to director Stephen Sommers, who is also in charge of the screenplay. You really feel like you are along for the adventure, as opposed to just observing it from a distance, as you witness the two leading characters, played by Fraser and Weisz respectively, go from disliking each-other to by the end of the movie being smitten with each-other, brought together by the difficulties faced during the resurrected mummy Imhotep's relentless pursuit to destroy them.All in all it is a movie you JUST have to see if you're an adventure film enthusiast, which if you aren't, what are you doing? I must warn though to take into consideration the emotional maturity of your youngling when watching this movie with your family, as there are some scenes that might scare young children.

Rachel Weisz and Brenden Fraser are perfect for they're roles, and give a very convincing act.It was very obvious that they were going to beat the mummy- This I knew before I started watching the movie.

849,electronmove,A Modern Adventure Classic,9,23 February 2020,"Set in the wind-swept dunes of Ancient Egypt, we're shown a quick glimpse of the origin story for what will soon become the early 20th century, where we're introduced to the tone for what will be the rest of the films length; our hero, O'Connell, serving in the French Foreign Legion, facing down an imminent threat with nothing but self-assuredness and brazen courage against over-whelming odds, and coming out alive. To his side is his ""buddy"" Beni.Mystic ancient orders, gun fights, sword fights, mummies, insects, magic, even a bi-plane, and then the afterlife, all set against the backdrop of the ruins of old, and the city-streets of new Egypt. While this movie relies on a good amount of CGI special effects to accomplish this, there's more than enough genuine stunt-work, wire-work, tracking shots on vehicles, and practical effects to keep the adventure enthusiast humbled, and the sets give off a very authentic-feeling atmosphere for 1920's Egypt, especially the ruins which feel old and forgotten by time, as if completely removed from the world, entering a place that teeters on the edge between the world of the living and the world of the dead. The studio could have skimped on the details, but everything from the hookah smoking, the period-authentic music in the background, and the money they use in few shots that it's visible, that even the small details were accounted for.The acting from the cast is nothing particularly jaw-dropping, but clearly done well enough to make you earnestly root for the characters, believe their backgrounds, and trust in what they're saying. Brendan manages to carry a brutish machismo undercut by a sly wit with a manner of grace that keeps him elevated and within the charming category. Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) gives her character a certain level of cute braggadociousness despite always being undercut by those around her, but still coming out ahead intellectually from time to time, keeping her from falling into the narrow trope of ""girl to rescue"" and more of someone to admire at times. Jonathan has the guile of a weasel as he sneaks in and out of confrontation, although remaining loyal to those he trusts. These 3 take up the majority of screen time, while other characters like Beni and Ardeth come and go throughout. Beni, on the one hand, plays a true con-artist and a coward, and very similar to Jonathan but playing the opposite of Jonathan's loyal characteristic where he is instead incredibly disloyal, favoring whoever has the upper hand. The roles blend together to create a truly entertaining thrill ride where you already know the out-comes for many of them, but it's just so fun you can't help but smile and hold on.Stephen Sommers crafted a truly great adventure film that stands up there with the greats like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Pirates of the Caribbean, Back to the Future, King Kong, and Jurassic Park. In another 10 years, this will be referred to as ""Classic Cinema"".",The Mummy
