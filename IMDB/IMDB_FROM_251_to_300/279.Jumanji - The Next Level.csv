0,Leofwine_draca,Generic,4,3 October 2020,"THE NEXT LEVEL is a disappointingly ho-hum follow up to the enjoyable JUMANJI reboot, a film which got by mainly on a funny script and plenty of charisma from the likes of The Rock. This one appears to have been rushed out to cash in on the first film's success and the quality of the script just isn't there. Instead, we get a bunch of that most lazy of Hollywood innotations, the giant CGI action spectacle set-piece, which just go on and on and feel like watching somebody else playing a computer game. The whole cast are back here with some solid additional work from the likes of Danny DeVito, Danny Glover and Rory McCann, but it's a pity that they have so little to work with in a film which screams ""generic"".",Jumanji - The Next Level
1,SnoopyStyle,fun but a little long,7,1 March 2020,"Spencer is struck in a rut and decides to go back into the game. Worried Martha convinces Bethany and Fridge to return to the game to find Spencer. Bethany fails and instead Spencer's grandfather Eddie and his friend Milo are sucked in.It's fun but a little long. While it's fun to do impressions of Danny DeVito and Danny Glover, the cast is getting crowded. Bethany could have join the group from the beginning which would simplify the story and possibly shorten it a little. The Rock and Kevin Hart are both having fun but Awkwafina is probably the best old man. This movie is missing the fade from the real life characters and their avatars. That's especially needed in the magic waters. All in all, this is fun but it could be better if simplifications are done to shorten the movie.",Jumanji - The Next Level
2,boblipton,Who Does The Best Danny Devito Impression?,6,21 December 2019,"I am very fond of the first iteration of JUMANJI, with Robin Williams giving a wonderful performance and the latest in CGI, which looks either quaintly charming or charmingly quaint a quarter of a century later. The remake a couple of years ago struck me as foolish before I saw it, but it turned into a highly amusing movie, with some favored performers. It made enough money that now it is a series. If they continue at this level, it will be a pleasant movie for me to see every couple of years.When we last saw Jumanji, it had been turned into a home video game, and the youngsters were vowing never to return. Well, by and large they do, because the last one turned into a surprise hit. They're a couple of years older, cracks have formed in their relationships, and for various reasons, two of them can't go in, because their avatars are taken by Danny Devito as Alex Wolff's grandfather, and Danny Glover as Devito's former business partner. They've been angry with each other for several years.It's a different adventure, and it makes as much sense as any video game. The avatars get swapped around, so the acting fun consists of watching the actors playing other actors in a FACE OFF sort of way. Dwayne Johnson does a pretty good Devito imitation, but Awkwafina does a better one.This is one movie that is not going to win any awards, but if you're not in the mood for deep-dish suffering nor for something biliously Christmas-like, this is a movie with good performers in roles and situations that will amuse you.",Jumanji - The Next Level
3,Prismark10,Jumanji: The Next Level,5,5 July 2020,"After the financial success of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. Director Jake Kasdan assembles the cast for a sequel and gets a for new senior members.It begins with unhappy Spencer (Alex Wolff) coming home for the festive holidays and restarting the console game of Jumanji.His friends Bethany (Madison Iseman), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) and Martha (Morgan Turner) find out that Spencer has gone into the game and follow him. They get stuck into a new adventure where they need to get a magical necklace from the big bad brutal baddie.It soon comes to light that two new players have been sucked in the game. Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny Devito) and his bickering old business partner Milo (Danny Glover). Eddie has no idea what is going on but discovers that he has the body in the shape of Dwayne Johnson's Dr Bravestone.Milo is Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar (Kevin Hart) is a zoologist who talks very slowly and rambles on leaving everyone in danger. Martha has the avatar of the athletic Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan).Jake Kasdan's father Lawrence wrote for both Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. There are elements here that are straight out of Spielberg's playbook. The rampaging ostriches in the desert could easily be Velociraptors in Jurassic Park.There is not much originality in this film. It is very much a retread of the last movie. The characters bicker, Eddie and Milo argue even more regarding their former diner closing down as Milo wanted to retire.The characters encounter dangers such as rampaging monkeys, they sometimes die in hilarious situations and lose a life. The main difference being that avatars can be swapped and this time the avatars also have weaknesses.The movie was too long with too many dull moments and the feeling you have seen it all before. The antagonists were wasted as they only played a minor part in the film.",Jumanji - The Next Level
4,nogodnomasters,We're in a game?,7,22 December 2019,"Poor Spencer (Alex Wolff) has issues with his feelings and repairs the game enough to enter. His friends become concerned and go after him. Danny Devito and Danny Glover get sucked in also. Solve the game, save Jumanji and exit. The twist is they have changed characters (save one) and have weaknesses that they have in real life.Not as good as the first reboot, but entertaining in spite of the tritely written drama. Dwayne Johnson was great as being occupied by Danny Devito and Hart was decent as Glover.",Jumanji - The Next Level
5,kosmasp,More levels,7,5 April 2021,"The fact we get some old school people here ... well the whole different bodies thing remains the same, but we get some new interesting characters here. Which is a nice change. No pun intended. Overall I reckon it remains the same formula and why change it when it worked the first time around.Lives given, lives taken and all that jazz. The special effects are terrific and the way the movie works its magic (no pun intended) is impressive. This may be enough for you or not. I kind of think, this works a bit better than the first one, what with the addition of new characters. But that will be up to you to decide.",Jumanji - The Next Level
6,classicsoncall,"""I can't say this enough. We're in a video game!""",7,5 December 2020,"I'm probably one of the few people that went about this all wrong. I haven't seen any of the prior movies, including the Robin Williams original film from 1995. Can anyone believe it's been twenty five years? So with all that, I thought this was fairly entertaining. It was a hoot to see actors like Duane Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black assume different personas as they made their way through the challenges thrown at them on the way to acquiring the Falcon Jewel. They all did a pretty good job of impersonating the characters they turned into, and even though the two Danny's, DeVito and Glover, didn't have a lot of screen time, you could feel their presence throughout the picture because of their roles portrayed by the avatars. As a senior citizen though, my best take away from the story came at the very end when DeVito's character came to terms with his age and stated to his grandson, ""Getting old is a gift"". I never really thought of it that way, and you know, it makes a lot of sense. For me, that was worth watching the movie all by itself.",Jumanji - The Next Level
7,jboothmillard,Jumanji: The Next Level,5,11 January 2020,"The original movie is a childhood favourite of mine, and the reboot movie (almost a sequel as well), Welcome to the Jungle, was actually good fun, and was one of the highest-grossing films of the year, so naturally the makers followed with a direct sequel, directed by Jake Kasdan (Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Bad Teacher). Basically, three years after entering the video game Jumanji, Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff), Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain), Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner), and Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman) lead different lives, but plan to reunite in Brantford. Spencer has become depressed, since he and Martha are having complications in their relationship, and he feels he has no purpose. Spencer contemplates returning to Jumanji and spends his first night looking over the broken video-game system he held onto. The following day, his friends visit his home, meeting with Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito), who is recovering from hip surgery, and Eddie's former friend Milo Walker (Danny Glover), who is visiting for an unknown reason. The group search the house for Spencer and find the Jumanji game repaired in the basement. Realising Spencer returned to the game, his friends decide to follow him. The game malfunctions when starting up, sucking in only Fridge and Martha, along with Eddie and Milo. Inside the game, Martha finds herself as her avatar Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), but Fridge has become Bethany's avatar Professor Professor Sheldon 'Shelly' Oberon (Jack Black), while Eddie is Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, also producing) and Milo is Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar (Kevin Hart). After instructing Eddie and Milo on the game's rules, the group encounter non-player character Nigel Billingsley (Rhys Darby), the game's guide, who reveals that Jumanji is suffering from a massive drought. To leave the game, the group must recover the ""Falcon's Heart"" - a magical necklace stolen by warlord Jurgen the Brutal (Rory McCann) - which can end the drought if brought before sunlight and uttering ""Jumanji"". The group are transported to a desert called the Dunes, and narrowly escape a flock of pursuing ostriches. Bethany meanwhile finds fellow Jumanji player Alex Vreeke (Colin Hanks) for help to enter the game and help her friends. Inside the game, the group find Spencer, who has become a new avatar, skilled thief Ming Fleetfoot (Awkwafina), who agrees to help them after blaming himself for their predicament. The group face new challenges and problems whilst escaping the Dunes and collect a needed in-game item called a Jumanji Berry. Whilst obtaining the fruit, Fridge and Martha discover a pool of green glowing water that allows them to exchange their avatars. On the journey, Eddie and Milo bicker, it is revealed their friendship ended when Milo sold a diner they owned behind Eddie's back, forcing him into retirement. The group next encounter a perilous series of broken hanging bridges, whilst being pursued by an aggressive troop of mandrills. They soon become reunited with Alex, as his avatar Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough (Nick Jonas), and Bethany, operating a new avatar called Cyclone - a black horse that can only be understood by Finbar. After leaving the Dunes, the party find a river with the same glowing green water, allowing Spencer, Bethany, and Fridge to become their original avatars, while Eddie and Milo end up as Ming and Cyclone respectively. Shortly after changing characters, Jurgen and his mercenaries capture the group and brings them to his fortress. Escaping captivity, Spencer and chases after Jurgen to his airship, while the others distract his men. Jurgen is too strong for Spencer, but then he realises he has a weakness, the Jumanji Berry, which incapacitates him and sends him plummeting to his death. Discovering Cyclone has retractable wings, Eddie and Milo work together to rescue Spencer and bring the recovered Falcon's Heart to the sun, calling out ""Jumanji"", ending the drought and completing the game. The necklace is given to Nigel for safekeeping, but the group are surprised when Milo wants to stay behind. Eddie learned that Milo was dying of cancer, hence why he wanted to make amends, they reconcile before Milo flies away. Upon returning to the real world, Spencer and his grandfather play video games together, while Eddie returns to his old diner and longs to work as a manager, with his grandson and his friends turning up to enjoy a meal together. But the game may not be over, as a Heater Repair Man (Lamorne Morris) is drawn to the video game system, and a flock of ostriches suddenly rush past the diner. Also starring John Ross Bowie as Cavendish, Massi Furlan as Switchblade, Marin Hinkle as Spencer's Mom, Bebe Neuwirth as Nora Shepherd and Dania Ramirez as Flame. As before, Johnson and Gillan kick butt, and Black and Hart provide the laughs, DeVito and Glover give the film some heart, and Awkwafina is a good new addition. It feels like almost exactly the same story as before though, there are not quite enough dangerous jungle creatures like the original, and it again relies more on the jokes, at least there are some reasonably exciting sequences with good special effects, not a bad action adventure comedy. Worth watching!",Jumanji - The Next Level
8,Tweekums,A sequel that is as much fun as the previous film,8,11 November 2021,"These comments assume people have seen the previous film so are familiar with the returning characters and the nature of the Jumanji game.Two years have passed since the events of the previous film and the four protagonists have drifted apart somewhat. They plan to get back together to catch up but Spencer doesn't turn up. He has been feeling down and restarts the Jumanji game. When 'Fridge', Martha and Bethany go to his house they find Eddie, his crotchety grandfather, along with his former business partner, Milo, but no sign of Spencer. They decide they must enter the game to find him. Things don't go as expected... Fridge and Martha end up in different game characters than before and Bethany is left behind... and rather bemused Eddie and Milo end up in the game. It isn't long before an NPC gives them their quest... they will have to face various challenges before they can leave the game; they also still need to find Spencer.Often sequels are a little disappointing but I found this to be as much fun as the original. The main actors are back playing four game avatars but thanks to a fun twist each is playing a different 'real world' person. There is almost non-stop action once they are in the game; this provides plenty of thrills and a similar number of laughs. The effects are impressive and the cast does a great job. Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black and Kevin Hart really impress as the four main avatars and Danny DeVito and Danny Glover are fun in the real world roles of Eddie and Milo. Awkwafina is a good addition as new avatar Ming Fleetfoot and Rory McCann is suitably menacing as villain Jurgen the Brutal. The story is pretty simple but serves its purpose of delivering action and laughs. Overall a lot of fun from start to finish; well worth watching if you enjoyed the first film.",Jumanji - The Next Level
9,BA_Harrison,"Gillan is my business, and business is good (but the film is only average).",5,8 December 2019,"The first Jumanji film, Welcome To The Jungle, was a lot of fun thanks to an amusing script, lots of entertaining state-of-the-art CG adventure action, and a great cast that included Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart. However, in my opinion, the best thing about the film was lovely Karen Gillan as Jumanji game avatar Ruby Roundhouse, a babelicious, kick-ass red-head in a skimpy outfit.The 'abs'-olutely gorgeous Gillan is back for the sequel and hotter than ever, making this a no-brainer for me, but the film itself is an otherwise fairly forgettable retread of the last one, with the same group of friends returning to the game where they attempt to save Jumanji (again) by retrieving another stone (from a barbarian and his horde). This time the gang is joined by two new players, Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) and fellow OAP Milo (Danny Glover), which leads to not-very-funny gags (repeated ad nauseum) about the elderly characters struggling to understand their situation.The script could have been written by a ten-year-old, such is the level of invention and the sophistication of the humour. The action is, once again, visually impressive (especially in 3D) but heavily reliant on CGI, lacking a sense of realism with little in the way of genuine excitement or thrills to be had. At no point do we feel that the characters are in any real peril, especially given that each of them have three lives to waste, which we all know will be more than enough for them to complete the task at hand.Given how much I enjoyed the first film, I'm surprised at just how average The Next Level is. Another Jumanji adventure is undoubtedly on the cards, and as long as Gillan is there, so will I, but I seriously hope the makers pay more attention to the plot and the comedy next time around.",Jumanji - The Next Level
10,paul_haakonsen,As funny as the previous movies...,6,15 February 2020,"If you enjoy the ""Jumanji"" movie franchise, then you will definitely also enjoy this 2019 addition. You know what you are getting yourself into when you sit down to watch the movie, and writers Jake Kasdan, Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg definitely deliver as expected.There is an abundance of fast-paced action, funny characters, witty banter and dialogue, as well as a very wholeheartedly entertainment value to the movie. It is actually quite nice to have the characters return to the screen and having the actors and actresses there as well.Visually then ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" definitely is up to par with the previous movie, if not slightly better actually. Everything delivered by the CGI team looks splendid and very realistic. Which is a must for an adventure movie such as this.The movie is nicely carried by the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, Nick Jonas, Awkwafina, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. There are also some nice appearances by the likes of Colin Hanks and Bebe Neuwirth.I can warmly recommend that you sit down to watch ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" regardless of doing so alone or with the family. This is an enjoyable and entertaining movie, with something for everyone to like and behold.I am rating ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" a six out of ten stars.",Jumanji - The Next Level
11,studioAT,On to the next level,6,20 December 2019,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was an unexpected triumph, especially when you consider it was up against Star Wars at the box office. What was more impressive though was the way that it managed to be both original and yet doff its cap to the 1995 original film starring Robin Williams. Trying to repeat the trick with another sequel though would be a risk.Thankfully though this does what all good sequels do and give us lots of what we liked about the last film, with a little more on top.Full of good jokes and some excellent performances, this was a good old fashioned action comedy.I would've liked a few more nods to the Robin Williams original, buy on the whole this was enjoyable.",Jumanji - The Next Level

13,CinemaSerf,"Less spontaneous than it's prequel, but not a bad effort for four months work.",7,11 December 2019,"Just imagine what you'd get if you shoved Indiana Jones, Where Eagles Dare, The Mummy and Taxi into the smoothie-maker; then added the music from Lawrence of Arabia, Tarzan and, oh yes - the Mummy again. I'll tell you - you would get this. The film doesn't have an original idea in it's two hour duration. HOWEVER - that doesn't make it bad. The same cast all pull together well and the action is pretty much end-to-end. The special effects are good, and it has killer ostriches. Danny DeVito looks worryingly like a racoon at times, but owns each scene he is in; Awkwafina is quite adept as the new, nimble-fingered member of the team and Nick Jonas stands about looking pretty. This is definitely not brain food, but there is plenty of humour for most of us and it doesn't drag. Ideal for this (Christmas) time of year. An added bonus for me, was that it drew a bigger audience tonight than probably the last ten films I have seen at our local Odeon put together.",Jumanji - The Next Level
14,grantss,Good fun but the novelty has worn off,5,30 August 2020,"The gang from Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle are back and now face new challenges.I enjoyed Jumanji - Welcome to the Jungle. The concept was fairly original: four real-life people get transported into a video game, are transformed into in-game characters quite different from their real-life ones all with unique traits, skills, strengths and weaknesses and have to battle to survive and get back to reality. Good fun.'The Next Level' is more of the same. Also fairly good fun but now the novelty has worn off. It initially just seemed like a rehash of the previous film, so much so I thought I was accidentally watching the first one again!The plot does develop some freshness as it develops but it all seems rather formulaic.Ultimately, okayish but that's all.",Jumanji - The Next Level
15,Calicodreamin,Amazing!,8,15 January 2020,"I loved every aspect of this movie, it was funny, it was action packed adventure, and had an awesome homage to the original. I liked that they took a lot of elements from the previous jumanji, that really translated well. Devito and Glover added so much to this cast, seeing the rock and Kevin hart as their avatars was so fun. The plot, the characters, the humor, it really ticked all the boxes. The only downside was the length, could have lost some minor scenes.",Jumanji - The Next Level
16,view_and_review,Hart and Black Carried the Movie,7,19 December 2019,"The two main questions going into this movie were 1.) How would the four characters we loved in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle be drawn back into the game and 2.) would it be as good?As for question number one, it was a bit absurd, but Spencer (Alex Wolff) was so depressed and emotionally lost that he pined to be Dr. Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) again. So, he repaired the busted game console in order to reenter it. The other characters, being his faithful friends, went in after him.As for question number two, it was just about as good. I liked the idea of introducing new people to be characters in the game. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart's characters were in fact two elderly men (Danny DeVito and Danny Glover). That small tweak made the movie fresh and funny. Kevin Hart and Jack Black stole the show, the two of them were hilarious.",Jumanji - The Next Level
17,neil-476,Great entertainment,9,16 December 2019,"Our four young friends from Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle are changed by their experience, though Spencer remains beset with self-doubt and has drawn away from everyone, even Martha. So he chooses to escape back into the game (repaired, but faulty) in the hope of another jolt of Braveheart. Unfortunately, when the other 3 try to follow him, things go wrong. And by things, I mean Spencer's crotchety grandfather Eddie, recovering from a hip operation, and Eddie's ex-partner and ex-friend Milo.It is a nice wrinkle to have the avatars occupied by different players, two of whom barely grasp the concept of videogames The videogame conceits are still there - we are now at the next level of the game, the avatars have taken on new abilities and weaknesses, and new playable characters are introduced. But otherwise we are in for another ride full of excitement and humour, with the avatar cast given the opportunity to have great fun playing familiar characters how playing host to entirely different people. It's a clever development of the idea underlying its predecessor.And, as always, Jumanji rewards those who play it successfully, sometimes in very surprising ways. And the closing moments of the movie carry a lovely tribute to the original movie.",Jumanji - The Next Level
18,morrison-dylan-fan,Level Up.,8,22 December 2019,"Going in knowing little about the title,I was surprised in late 2017 how much of a thrill ride Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017-also reviewed) turned out to be. Chatting to a pal about meeting up before X-Mas, he suggested us going to see the new Jumanji, which led to me getting set to play a new game.View on the film:Showing they've still got game,Danny DeVito and Danny Glover as old pals Eddie and Milo, who find a new lust for life from the new reality the game offers. Wisely keeping all the players from the last film together,the ensemble cast unlock all the achievements with awesome turns, as fittie Karen Gillan performs Roundhouse's new spinning kicks (which spoofs Lara Croft's old moves) with a real crunch, Jack Black dead pans his frustrations over his avatar having no fighting skills, The Rock and Kevin Hart continue their tag team of Hart's agitated quips with Rock's crowd pleasing one-liners and slick fighting moves.Coding the new levels, returning co-writer/(with Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg) director Jake Kasdan & cinematographer Gyula Pados open the new game modes up to a thrilling breakneck Action Adventure atmosphere, taking detours from the jungle setting to winter castles caught in sky-high wide-shots by Kasdan. Along with expanding the game setting, Kasdan also merrily riffs on staples of video games, from stuck on repeat NPC's and deadly traps puzzle games, to the gang falling from the sky after losing a life level, as they try to beat the next level.",Jumanji - The Next Level
19,bombersflyup,Have some respect.,2,8 August 2020,"Jumanji: The Next Level has no heart and no consequence, it's fluff.The casting of Johnson and Hart lets you know the lack of sincerity with which the project is regarded in the first place. The original's a masterpiece, this possesses none of the charm. In fact, they're nothing alike. I didn't realize there was already a sequel before this, but I feel no need to see it as it has most of the same cast. Has a bit of humour with Black and DeVito, who don't even appear to be in the previous film, but it's all a joke and not that funny.",Jumanji - The Next Level
20,phd_travel,Bit confusing but some nice visuals,6,6 December 2019,Takes a while to remember what happened in number 1 and sort out the characters.

21,deloudelouvain,Always entertaining.,8,17 March 2020,"There are not a lot of franchises that are good from the beginning till the end but Jumanji is an exception to that rule. The quality of the movies is constant so if you liked the first or the second movie you will probably like this one as well. I always have a lot of pleasure watching any of the Jumanji movies. There is that right amount of humor mixed with adventure. The CGI's are well done, giving the movie an extra little thing that adds to the adventurous feeling when your watching Jumanji. The cast is like usual very good in Jumanji. Every character and actor adds something special to the plot. I'm normally not a fan at all of The Rock but in Jumanji Dwayne Johnson is actually funny to watch. And even if the story is basically the same in all Jumanji movies it's still entertaining, that says enough about the quality of these movies. I'm not done with Jumanji, I could watch another one.",Jumanji - The Next Level

It's back to the jungle but with more characters, good story and loads of charm. The slight bank towards zany is welcome here and makes for an easygoing and entertaining diversion after the holidays.

23,DKosty123,The Game Continues with a Whole New Play,8,4 January 2020,"Recently, our deep in trouble mall brought back it's first video arcade in many years. Well, this movie upgraded it's cast from the first one, and it doesn't lose a thing versus the earlier film. I'm not sure if an arcade now will be in time to save our mall (though it would help if they brought movie theaters back into too), but this movie is entertaining and a whole lot of funny.Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Heart, and additions like veteran Danny Devito are all positive in this one. The plot is exactly the same as the first time around, another video game of Jumanji only with real people thrown into the game. If anything, the script is a solid item indeed and the cast brings it off.The film never gives a viewer much chance tro rest. There's action on top of action, just like the video game. If they make enough of these, there will come a day when a marathon of them will be playing, and playing and playing and maybe, just maybe the next game will rescue our ailing mall. A lot of malls are being turned into Senior Housing. Rushing in a good game of Jumanji could improve sales- at the Tom Brady Scooter store.Put your brain away and enjoy this action film.",Jumanji - The Next Level
24,cherold,Fun and funny sequel,8,8 April 2020,"I enjoyed this movie a bit more than the previous one, but that may just be because I saw the previous one on an airplane, which is never the ideal.Anyway, once again a bunch of people are sucked into a video game, only this time some of the people are new. The result is that Dwayne Johnson is lots of fun as a cantankerous old man, Kevin Hart is utterly amazing as a loquacious old man, and Awkwafina is very funny as two very different people.Once again, the lovely Karen Gillan is overshadowed, but that's not entirely her fault. Unlike the other actors, she only plays one character, and it's a particularly bland character. Jack Black is also underwhelming in a new role but improves markedly when he gets to play his role from the first film.Anyway, the story is entertaining, the new characters are hilarious, I love Awkwafina, Gillan is very hot, and all-in-all I found this tremendously entertaining.",Jumanji - The Next Level

26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Level up.,7,8 December 2019,"Even though its central concept seems ever-so-slightly more strained this time, 'Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)' is about as good as its predecessor. In fact, it's sometimes even better. Basically, the flick is just fun. The crowd-pleasing body-swapping is amped up to eleven, shaking things up just enough so that they feel fresh. The main actors continue to properly impress in their chameleon-like roles, joined by a few extra treats that perform far better than you'd perhaps expect. Indeed, these new players are probably its biggest asset; a couple of them thoroughly perforate the entire experience despite only having a rather small amount of screen-time. The picture is often funny - though, never hilarious - and is oddly endearing, to boot. It isn't particularly deep or, even, memorable but it doesn't need to be. It's a good time at the movies; what more do you need? Obviously some better theming and, perhaps, a tad of nuance wouldn't go amiss, but it's just not that kind of film really and that's perfectly fine. Even if it doesn't impact you as much as some of the year's best, it'll certainly make you smile and keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Besides, its inciting incident is driven purely by character and it even manages to squeeze some genuine emotional connection, via a well-drawn dynamic between DeVito and Glover, into its otherwise otherworldly proceedings. Its acting is also deceptively simple but decidedly fantastic, fully immersing you in the idea that these major stars are actually four teenagers and two old men. Basically, it's not as simple as you might think. 7/10",Jumanji - The Next Level
27,ThomasDrufke,Full of Heart and Humor,8,19 December 2019,"I believe this is the 4th collaboration between Dwayne The Rock Johnson and Kevin Hart (if you count Hobbs and Shaw) and their chemistry together still stands as one of the best 1-2 punches in Hollywood. At this point, I hope they make 20 films together and I'll be there for every single one. And even in Jumanji: The Next Level, where for the majority of the screen time they are mimmicking Danny Devito and Danny Glover, they are magnetically charismatic, if that's even a phrase. As a whole, the film is more than a worthy sequel to the surprise 2017 film where a video game traps 4 teenagers into a made up world known as Jumanji. In terms of structure, the 2nd film isn't all that different but it succeeds with its enormous heart, winning script, and performance from its 4 main leads and expanded supporting cast. Hopefully The Next Level continues to crush at the box office and the series will live on for many more films.8.7/10",Jumanji - The Next Level

31,Bored_Dragon,"""You got to have eyes in the back of your...""",6,20 December 2020,"The sequel to ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" (2017) tried to make some changes in order to avoid being just a pale copy of the original, and to some extent it succeeded, but it lacks originality and the factor of surprise that the first film had. I can't say that the first one is objectively better, and I think my impressions would have been reversed if the films had come out in reverse order. But it is what it is, so the first one got an extra point for originality and surprise, and the second one I will rate as it really deserves.6,5/10",Jumanji - The Next Level

33,ironhorse_iv,Jumanji: The Next Level is not quite an enjoyable adventure for those who seek a way to leave their world behind. It was kinda disappointing.,6,11 January 2020,"Don't get me wrong, I kinda like 2017 updated remake/sequel to the 1995 Robin Williams film which in return is based on Chris Van Allsburg's beloved children's book about a board game coming to live. The story written by Chris McKenna and others like Erik Sommers, Scott Rosenberg & Jeff Pinkner about a bunch of high school kids being sucked down into the jungle settlings of the video game version of the magical board game Jumanji was a surprise hit for me. Despite if it doesn't make much sense story wise; seeing how the game washed up around a French Canadian coast in the first movie. The film directed by Jake Kasdan was still a breath of fresh air as instead of having the implements animals and other jungle elements effect the real world; it had the players go into the treasure hunting adventure realm under over the top character avatars playing as individuals that were opposite from their normal types. I love that these selfish loners had to better themselves and try to work together to get out of it. By the end of the film. Everything was wrap up together pretty well and resolved. To tell you the truth, I didn't felt that this franchise needed another movie. There was no reason for the protagonist Spencer (Alex Wolff) to go back to the game as Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) even if he's super depressed. It's clear by the beginning of this 2019 film, he still has his friends and family. Fairly this movie also written & directed by the same filmmakers as the 2017 one could had work better if he was accidently sucked back in the world due to the game being broken and having the rest of his friends rescue him before Jumanji crashes. Why not have the game cause glitches that teleport the players to erratically different unique locations and allow certain NPC to be playable? It would made more sense than the game updating itself with a new treasure hunt even though it's supposed to be broken. It would be awesome to see odd bizarre ragdolls physics, some distorted textures, certain NPC freezes up or characters going to invisible walls. Sadly we don't much or any of that. The only apparent instance of a glitch the players encounter is the water that lets them switch characters. However I found that as a cheap cop out as the gamers never got used to playing avatars opposite from themselves by the end. It's especially disappointing that characters like Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner) is so selfish depended on their original avatar that they're not willing to try anything new. It's a step back for her character. Having Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain) switch avatar with her had a ton of potential but unfortunately it never last even one single scene. It sucks because I really wanted to see Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) act unique & different than in the last movie. Sadly that character felt so regular that it became boring to watch her scenes. At least she wasn't annoying. I really couldn't stand any of the avatars portraying Grandpa Eddie Gilpin (Danny DeVito). That character is too damn bitter and grouchy for my taste. I just wanted to mute whenever Eddie is on screen. Nothing good come out from his mouth. Even Dwayne Johnson and Awkwafina near perfect comic timing and mimicry ability couldn't made me root for him. I can care least about the diner arguments he has with Milo Walker (Danny Glover). It slow the movie down to ground still. I kinda wish the movie focus more on Milo's health than him talking about the past. At least, Milo's ignorance of the game & worldview is lot easier to deal with. Kevin Hart deserves praise for doing an exceptionally good impression of an older gentleman seeing that he was pretty much playing himself as Mouse Finbar in the last movie. As for Jack Black as Professor Shelly Oberon, he is wonderful as always. The way he acts as Bethany (Madison Iseman) and as Fridge is nearly day to night. It's wonderful. However there was no need for Alex Vreeke (Colin Hanks) to return as Seaplane McDonough (Nick Jonas) as that role could had to Spencer since he is the person missing in this film. Regardless the whole idea of a horse being a playable character was unique enough that I kinda enjoy that. However the antagonists in this piece felt a bit wasted as Jurgen the Brutal (Rory McCann) & Switchblade (Massi Furlan) are not in many scenes. They barely have any moments to shine. Most of the threats of this world came from the animals. Action scenes with the mandrill monkeys on the bridge was intense and exciting with its quick puzzling solving work & chase on dune buggies while getting pecked at by large ostriches were apocalyptic fun to witness. However the deaths on this adventure were not as memorable as the last movie. No explosion cake here. As for the climax. It felt like a rethread. It didn't quite go to the next level for me. While the final moments of the end credit will set up yet another sequel. I sadly going to call it quits for now. Overall: This latest movie play it too safe with its concept to the point that it's not really worth playing. It's a game over for me. Sadly.",Jumanji - The Next Level

35,The-Sarkologist,Quite Fun,6,4 January 2020,"I probably shouldn't have been all that surprised that they decided to go ahead with a sequel because, well, that is all that seems to be happening these days when it comes to movies, particularly if the previous movie was successful. Look, don't get me wrong, I did quite enjoy this film, but the thing that really stuck in my mind was that, well, it was pretty much the same as the previous film, but then again, I guess one still works on the principle of if it works, then why mess with it?Okay, there are a few little differences, namely because it goes on from what happened previously. Our heroes have all gone off on their separate ways, but are returning home for the holidays (yes, this is a Christmas movies, and of course, it was released during the Christmas period). However, Spencer sort of suffers from a bit of doubt, and misses the fact that when he was in the video game he played the big, hulking, Dwayne Johnson. So, he goes back.As it turns out, they don't go back as the characters that they originally played, so it turns out that it is a little trickier. Also, it seems that some further abilities have been added, which is a little odd considering that this video game apparent sat, broken, in the basement for about a year, and it is also one of those machines that really doesn't seem to have access to software updates on the internet.One pretty cool thing about this film is that a couple of veteran actors suddenly make an appearance, namely Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. Honestly, it has been ages since I have seen these legends of 80s cinema on the big screen, though of course they are pretty old these days (and it is a shame that I never got to make a movie about Jesus where Danny DeVito played the titular character). However, it should be pointed out that they are really only at the start, and at the end, since most of the film takes place in the world of the game.As a film it was quite fun, and it is certainly suited for bringing the family along to enjoy it. However, I wouldn't consider it to be anywhere near one of the greatest films ever made, particularly since it does happen to be a sequel. Still, it isn't all that bad.",Jumanji - The Next Level

Including what's usually the last one saying put your phone away!! But this time there was another 4 after it!!I tend to slate Dwayne Johnson for playing himself in everything, and his movies being forgettable, but it was certainly entertaining to watch Dwayne Johnson impersonate Danny DeVito and Kevin Hart do his best Danny Glover impression!! This is probably more favourite performance by Kevin Hart, cos he wasn't being Kevin Hart!! That was the best thing about the movie for me. I was surprised to see Awkwafina is in this, I'm rapidly becoming a fan of hers, after The FarewellI doubt i'll feel the need to rewatch it, but for the most part, I enjoyed it and laughed a few times, but something happens about an hour in, and then from there it just got a bit flat for me!!There were too many people in my screening to count, (an 11am Wednesday showing) so I expect it to gross a billionTrailers shown were

I enjoyed not only the plot which I found it interesting and not boring but also the direction which was different than the first movie. I liked the fact that the game had changed and also some other things inside it. Regarding the interpretations, for one more time Jack Black who played as Oberon was simply hilarious, Dwayne Johnson who played as Dr. Bravestone, Kevin Hart who played as Mouse and Karen Gillan who played as Ruby.

39,cruise01,Level up to the next fun adventure.,8,14 December 2019,"Jumanji: The Next Level (4 out of 5 stars).Jumanji: The Next Level is another fun exciting adventure film that brings back the same cast from the second installment. And taking them into a whole new adventure with a few new twists with the characters. If you love the second movie Welcome to the Jungle. You will love this movie which takes the characters in new adventures and exciting action set pieces. The fun humor.The plot follows Spencer (Alex Wolff) who is feeling distant with his friends Fridge (Ser Darius Blain), Martha (Morgan Turner), and Bethany (Madison Iseman). Spencer now has his grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) living with them. Which Eddie friend Milo (Danny Glover) comes to visit. When Spencer brings back the game Jumanji ands pulled in. His friends try to search for him and gets back into the game. The twist is Eddie and Milo are also pulled in and are disguised as Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), and Mouse (Kevin Hart). While Fridge is now Shelly (Jack Black) and Martha is still Ruby (Karen Gillan). The new adventure of Jumanji is to search for the stolen gem that is captured by a group of bad guys.The plot is similar to the first movie with new twist. Which the twists makes it a lot of fun. Seeing Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart's interpretation as Danny Glover and Danny DeVito. Fresh faces, fresh humor, and a lot of action sequences. From some crazy dune chase sequence with the characters being chased by a herd of ostriches. To a swinging walkaway bridges with characters being chased by monkeys. And a showdown fight scene with Karen Gillan and Dwayne Johnson fighting through an army of guys. It is not short on the action.I love the cast ensemble. Dwayne, Karen, Jack, and Kevin are all fun and great. I would love to see another adventure with them. Nick Jonas makes an appearance which is fun. New additions like Awkwafina, Danny DeVito, and Danny Glover brings some fun fresh energy into the movie as well.The plot may be nothing new to the series. Which is similar to the second movie.

40,eddie_baggins,The Next Level rehashes the first film to medicore effect,5,22 January 2020,"A few years ago you could hear the collective groans and outcry when the world first heard about the Jumanji re-imagining that would be released in 2017.What type of Hollywood blasphemy was this? That they believed the world wanted a new take on the classic Robin William's starring family film with boardgames being turned into video games? There was no way surely that the new Jumanji would be any good.Well almost a billion dollars at the world wide box office later and solid reviews from critics and audiences alike proved us all wrong, as director Jake Kasdan and his all-star cast showed that a whole new world of Jumanji wasn't actually that bad of an idea.As is the case with anything so successful, Jumanji didn't lay dormant for long as it gets the core gang of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillan and Kevin Hart back once more for a return to the world of a dangerous interactive game, but this time there's far less surprises in store as Kasdan and his team mostly re-heat what they produced in the 2017 outing.With expectations so low the first time around, audiences found themselves surprised by the amount of solid laughs and cast chemistry that was found in Welcome to the Jungle but The Next Level can't find that same style of unexpected delights, even if it swaps up avatars between our players and introduces geriatrics Danny Glover and Danny DeVito to this new adventure.Everything that takes place in Next Level is fairly predictable and slight, with Kasdan and his cast unable to conjure up the same unexpected magic they did first time around even if the films bigger budget and more large-scale spectacle will keep viewers interested and the tween audience glued to the screen throughout.With the same setup of the gang having to battle a dastardly NPC and save the kingdom, it makes it harder for all the banter and character beats to shine through even if all performers are clearly having another bout of good times, with Johnson and Hart having the most fun doing their best impressions of DeVito and Glover.It feels as though now the new financially viable series is in a place where further installments will have to push the boundaries narratively quite a bit further should it want to remain relative, as while its fooled us all once and to a lesser extent twice, a third time would be a bridge too far for a franchise that has become one of the most surprisingly popular of the modern era.Final Say -Still watchable and instilled with fun performances, Jumanji: The Next Level cant hide the fact its story and jokes have quickly started to feel a little stale, with a fresh approach needed when the next installment hits.2 1/2 pollen weaknesses out of 5",Jumanji - The Next Level
41,leonblackwood,Surprisingly Enjoyable! 7/10,7,27 August 2020,"Review:
Although the storyline is far-fetched, I must admit, I really enjoyed this film. The fact that Jack Black, The Rock and Kevin Hart weren't acting the same as they have done in most of there films, made it interesting and the CGI was top form, especially during the Emu and Monkey scenes. The storyline was also written well, and the chemistry between all of the characters, especially the Rock and Kevin Hart, was great. It's harmless fun for the whole family, with decent action scenes, and enough tension to keep you glued to the screen. The various twists and turns throughout the film, made the two hours seem like an hour, and I liked the fact that each character got the same amount of screen time, including the new characters, Eddie (Danny DeVito) and Milo (Danny Glover). Ming (Awkwafina) was also a brilliant addition to the cast, alongside Jurgen the Brutal (Rory McCann), who is well known for playing the Hound in the Game of Thrones. Don't get me wrong, it's not a cinematic masterpiece, like the original Jumanji which was released in 1995, but for a sequel, the director managed to produce something fresh and unique with the same characters. It's not often I can say that I would watch a movie again, but I honestly think that I would give this a second watch, especially as a lot of movies got held back this year. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Jake Kasdan, who also brought you Zero Effect in 1998, Orange County, The TV Set, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Bad Teacher, Sex Tape and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. With the first movie making $962million, it was in the studio's interest to bring these characters back to the big screen, even though Dwayne Johnson's wages must have doubled. This film had one of the fastest turnarounds from filming to theatrical release for a major studio film, with filming beginning in February 2019 and wrapped four months later in May. It was then released in December, seven months later, which was extremely quick compared to most films which are released one year after filming. After seeing Dwayne Johnson's schedule, it's not surprising that they had to get this film wrapped fast. With 14 films in development and due to be released, including Red Notice starring Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot, Jungle Cruise with Emily Blunt, Black Adam, which is a spin-off from Shazam, Big Trouble in Little China and San Andreas 2, he's definitely in demand. Although this movie didn't make as much money as the original, I hope to see these characters again because it has the makings of a decent franchise.Budget: $125million

42,TheMovieDiorama,Jumanji: The Next Level confidently advances onto the next stage whilst recycling the same gameplay mechanics.,6,24 June 2020,"Much like in a video game, a sequel retains the same core components that provides the intellectual property with unique qualities whilst implementing an aesthetic makeover to provide a new world to explore. Whether that be a graphical enhancement or a re-designed open playable world for the player to explore. The very definition of a role-playing game. 'Welcome to the Jungle', the first instalment of the rebooted franchise, asserted the base gameplay functions of uncovering the mystery of the world by linearly heading from point A to point B to point C etc. whilst employing character-based comedy to keep the adventure feeling fresh. Surprisingly self-aware and joyously buoyant throughout.Kasdan's adventurous sequel follows the same rules as a video game continuation. It's bigger, it's better, and it's more of the same. Set three years after the now four best friends survived the first adventure, Spencer, consumed by his comparatively dull adolescence, returns to Jumanji where he felt he had substantial purpose as an individual. His friends, worried after not showing up to a friendly reunion, suddenly hear the beat of jungle drums, realising that Spencer has activated Jumanji once more. Only this time, ""Fridge"" and Martha are taken leaving Bethany in reality. Resulting in Spencer's grandfather and long-time business partner Milo being transported to the fictitious world instead as Dr. Bravestone and Finbar respectively. Naturally, the older generation attempting to understand the mechanics of a video game (NPCs, three lives, strengths and weaknesses etc.) creates an unadorned amount of comedy that equally diminishes the character of Roundhouse to nothing more than expositional tutorials.Much of the laughter is expelled at the sights of Johnson and Hart mildly impersonating DeVito and Glover. Whilst the latter has the slow tempo down perfectly, the former is the least ""The Rock"" we've seen him as since, well, ever. Watching him attempt the New Jersey/New York accent was mildly hilarious to say the least. This sequel really revolves around these two characters, whom share a jaded past that seeks reconciliation. Unlike the ""Jaguar's Eye"", they are the true heart of Jumanji. Adequate development to make their differences affecting, without relinquishing much of the humour. Their new strengths and weaknesses, including communicating with animals and Bravestone acquiring just one weakness that was admittedly vastly underdeveloped, appropriately utilised to produce a change of pace when comparing to its predecessor. And, above all else, funnier than their initial appearance. Spencer controls a new avatar, played by the dominating Awkwafina, who really asserts her presence amongst the pre-existing avatars. Oberon, with Black on cruise control, mostly assists with the exposition while indicating his weakness to desert characteristics.Speaking of arid horizons, the jungle has been substituted for the desolation of heat, a dense woodland environment and snow-capped mountain, as the team attempt to reclaim the ""Falcon Jewel"" from warlord Jurgen the Brutal in order to save Jumanji and return to reality. The same criticisms from the first film apply here. The narrative is ridiculously linear and mundanely straightforward that, half the time, the screenplay itself forgets what the main objective is. The feature works best when divulging in exciting character-based set pieces, to which Kasdan acknowledges this by throwing the core contents of the plot to the side for the vast majority of the adventure. It's the exact same premise, just a different location. Kasdan also moderately relies on humour setup in the previous entry, such as Roundhouse fighting villainous NPCs through the medium of rhythmic combat to the tune of ""Baby I Love Your Way"" (ooof such a tune!), which also heightens the sense of over-familiarity. Although, Hart shouting ""No!"" to cake ensured many howls! The villain, Jurgen, much like Professor Van Pelt (remember him? Me neither!) was instantly forgettable and provided minimal menace. The visual effects were noticeably digital, particularly the backdrops, however closeups of ostriches and mandrills certainly harnessed attentive detail.One could argue that the digitised gimmicks and hokey plot conveniences are all part of the game world, and they would be correct. Kasdan once again provides fantastic family entertainment that relishes in bold characterised set pieces, albeit with another less than substantial plot. Employing the exact same formula that made its predecessor a financial success, with a few avatar changes here and there. Granting profitable amounts of replay value in the process.",Jumanji - The Next Level

45,southdavid,Not a level up,6,15 January 2020,"I quite enjoyed the last Jumanji film. Knowing and witty, it played with its dynamic nicely and was funny and entertaining. Less impressed with this sequel though, that seems more like ""downloadable add on"" rather than a whole new adventure.Disappointed with how his college life isn't matching up to his time in the game, Spencer (Alex Wolff) renters Jumanji. His friends attempt a rescue, but unfortunately, Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) and his former business partner Milo (Danny Glover) are pulled in as well. The heroes deal with not playing as their previous characters, as well as their two elderly interlopers whilst trying to rescue Spencer and save Jumanji once more.The immediate reason why I don't think ""The Next Level"" works is unfortunately, because of the new dimensions brought it by Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. When they enter the game the idea of having two older people in it is funny for the first couple of minutes, but once that's over you're left with The Rock and Kevin Hart rumbling over the same lines and gags repeatedly. It doesn't help that for all their genuine talents, neither of them is particularly good at mimicking the actors they're supposed to be inhabiting. It's no coincidence that the film is markedly better in the last twenty minutes, when everybody McGuffins back into the characters they played last time. Call me a ""Snowflake"" or whatever you like, but I found the scenes when Jack Black and Karen Gillen pretended to be Anthony's character uncomfortable.The rest of the film is fine, the plots ... meh, the set pieces are sufficient, the visuals are OK - but it's all definitely inferior to last time. The credits scene sets up a sequel in the real world, which to be honest, I'd quite like to see - let's let the kids have their own film.",Jumanji - The Next Level

Only this time it's a whole new map, whole new challenges and even a couple of new characters. What's not to love?Okay, the premise itself is pretty similar to the first one, but that's not really a bad thing in this case. It gives us what we want and it's humorous to see the old players reacting with dread to old challenges while the new players are still coming to grips with what's happening.What I don't like is the fact the relationships from the previous film are pretty much reset. Most notably the romance. Why couldn't these two remain together in between films? What's the point of having them romance each other all over again? That's just lazy sequel writing at its worst.Still, the film is entertaining and it's nice to see Johnson, Gillan, Black and Hart playing yet another set of characters who are controlling them. Seeing The Rock trying to pull off Danny DeVito is pure comedy gold.Nothing much to say, really. If you liked the first one, this is more of the same, but in a good way.

Nice to see all the actors return, almost feels like they never left. It's the same, but different in some ways, Karen Gillian is great, returning has the awkward girl trapped in a Lara Croft like characters body. Jack Black was good, and so was Kevin Hart, but it's Dwayne Johnson steals most of the show has Danny DeVito trapped in a big man's body. DeVito is also good has Spencers grandfather.

This is a direct sequel to the 2017 Jumanji:Welcome to the Jungle and third in the series, counting the original from 1995. This movie is fast paced, humorous and entertaining. There are several cameos such as Danny DeVito, Danny Glover and Awkwafina that are very good-Nick Jonas & Colin Hanks return as well, and there is a surprise cameo from the 1995 original movie. There is a twist here; the body occupations are switched. Dwayne is occupied by Danny DeVito, Jack by different teens and Kevin by Danny Glover. Karen has some funny inhabitants, too. This one also has more diverse settings than just the jungle, including snowy mountains and treeless deserts. The ending is a hint for a sequel and there is a scene right after the end credits start that ties in with the original 1995 movie.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, language and some suggestive material and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes.

52,GiraffeDoor,Roll the dice on this.,8,28 April 2021,"Completely inoffensive, no brainer action adventure with humor, set pieces and convincing effects. Briefly: the full package for a friday escape with the girls. Assuming you're the girls I'd like to know.Not only is every actor vivid, it's a lot easier to appreciate the talent they bring to the role since most of them are effectively playing double roles. It is quite darling to see the Rock try to be Danny Devito and although he could be more convincing in that capacity, he tries so dang hard it's fun to watch.Later the one called ""Awfafina"" plays the same character. I only know her from Angry Birds 2 and the IMDB clickbait but I was quite impressed.In addition to all of this, there were moments I did actually find profoundly moving.My one real criticism is there is a pretty weak reason to get them back in the game. Yes, they go in after one of their own but his motivations feel very abstract and the soft pedalled relationship drama that forms a half-hearted C-plot is not what anyone came to see.",Jumanji - The Next Level
53,alindsay-al,A great sequel that is a fun time,8,1 January 2020,"I actually enjoyed the first Jumanji welcome to the jungle film and I thought that this sequel was a worthy sequel that provides a lot of fun in this film. The premise of the film sees the group have to return to the game but they have some new players and new scenarios to tackle. The group are back, Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart and Jack Black are back in this film and they are all great. They show their acting ability as they have to take on different acting then they did in the first film. The group's chemistry is really good and really drives the film and makes this film more entertaining then it really has a right to be. Nick Jonas is back for a small role in this film and he does a decent job especially with the screen time given. Rory McCann plays the bad guy in the film and he is a cliche villain but he does a good job as the evil villain that we have to vanquish. The story is entertaining, seeing the group have to go against different enemies is fun to watch. But there isn't really anything that stands out as revolutionary and it doesn't really do anything to make it a truly legendary comedy. The script has some really funny dialogue in it that has me laughing throughout, also there is a surprisingly good level of drama when necessary that fleshed out a few of the characters. The style is exciting, the action scenes and creativity is fun to watch. However, this film doesn't pay off some of its story elements which shows a bit of an issue with its pacing. Overall this is a really fun film to watch and is definitely a worthy sequel.",Jumanji - The Next Level

(My little sister always demanded to employ the scotty dog avatar as her marker on the board, which I didn't mind a single bit because I preferred the iron.) I usually got stuck with being the ""Banker,"" since I got good grades in math. But I really hated making change all the time (and it was pretty tedious trying to remember to dole out $200 every time someone passed ""Go""). However, the movie variation of JUMANJI seems to be an even bigger pain in the butt than the beloved store version. The perverse concept of everyone changing bodies whenever anyone gets wet--like some Parents' Swap Night Party of musical chairs--surely would have grossed out we children and deterred us from playing JUMANJI a second time. Ditto the idea of gamers becoming nonverbal animals such as horses, whether they could fly or not.

58,jimbo-53-186511,Something's a little amiss here,5,10 August 2021,"In hindsight, the vague plot summary for this film (seemingly everywhere you look) perhaps should have acted as a warning, but having found the original film to be a fairly fun romp I ignored this and sat down hoping for more of the same, but sadly this didn't quite happen...So back to the narrative it begins with Spencer deciding to re-visit the game so that he can be his tough avatar character because he's having self-esteem issues, but then when his friends go in to the game to rescue Spencer they are tasked with another mission (the group later discover that Spencer has been assigned the same mission when they meet up with him later in the film). Although the original focus was on rescuing Spencer this soon becomes forgotten about as the team work together to return a jewel back to a village; which begs the question what was the point in establishing the narrative as a rescue mission when it didn't really serve any purpose? I guess that was the only way the writers could think of setting up a sequel to a film which didn't really need one (in fact it's such a weak set-up that money could surely have been the only motivation here).Another thing I wasn't a big fan of was the chopping and changing of characters; it didn't really work and as with the first film it is the camaraderie between the characters that saves the film rather than what the writers did with the characters. Johnson was probably the worst offender with his repetitive cluelessness coming close to driving me insane (mercifully he isn't like this for the entirety of the film). The film boasts the likes of Danny DeVito and Danny Glover amongst the cast which was refreshing to see, but disappointing when they are only reduced to cameo appearances (the 2 veterans were great in the screen time they were given).In terms of spectacle, Jumanji: The Next Level matches the first film; there are some exciting moments and some reasonable special effects, but there's no heart to the picture and no real purpose. It's 2 hours long as well and boy does it feel it; considering how thin the story is it's incredible how the writers managed to drag it out for this long.Jumanji: The Next Level has its moments and is watchable (although that's mainly thanks to a game cast selling it well), but ultimately it just feels undernourished, uninspiring and perhaps most importantly unnecessary.",Jumanji - The Next Level
59,lukem-52760,"JUST GREAT FUN & FULL OF HEART, BEST JUMANJI YET",8,15 April 2020,"""The Next Level"" was a super fun sequel & easily the best film of the franchise so far!!!
I grew up in the 90's so loved the Robin Williams first film & totally enjoyed the first Dwayne Johnson entry but this sequel ups everything even better & more fun & more heart.The inclusion of two Cinema legends, Danny Glover & Danny Devito was a Genius idea & added another level of Cinema quality to the film. I grew up watching Danny Glover in such Classic's as the Lethal Weapon franchise & the brilliant & underrated Predator 2, I love Danny Glover he's great. I also grew up watching the hilarious Danny Devito in his Classic's such as Twins & Junior, he starred alongside the King of Action Schwarzenegger in both, Love Danny Devito too.
The kids from Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle are back & abit older & seem to have lost much contact with each other so Spencer whilst feeling lost in the world rebuilds the Jumanji game & goes back to the fantasy Game world of Jumanji to feel like he did before as the handsome & beefed up hero Bravestone. The other friends end up going back to Jumanji to find Spencer & bring him back but there's a couple of hilarious twists, one is that all the characters are now mixed up & there in different bodies than before & the 2nd is that Spencer's grandad Eddie & his old buddy Milo have also been sucked into the Game.
Danny Devito playes Eddie & Danny Glover plays Milo, both hilarious as they end up in other bodies & again it's so nice to see this team back together again with Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart (The funniest I've seen him as Danny Glover's slow & soft speaking Backpack guy), Jack Black & Karen Gillian. Everyone on board seems to be having so much fun & it's infectious on screen, this is full of fantastic fantasy fun & action & adventure & some beautiful set pieces but most of all its full of Heart & deals with the fact of life that we all have to grow old!!!
At the Heart of this sweet sequel is the lovely friendship between two old friends now in their 70's (Glover & Devito) & giving life a 2nd chance & having fun & just to appreciate making it to be old.

Too late! That was the first thing I did.In recent years, the terms ""Remake"" and ""Reboot"" have become very popular in Hollywood. Much to my annoyance. In most cases, these knockoffs are just a shadow of the original. Not to say abominably bad and horrible to look at. The biggest example of this (for me personally anyway) is the movie ""Ghostbusters"" from 2016. If Bill Murray was no longer among the living, he would have turned around in his grave. A needless copy without humor and full of recycled ideas. A few years ago when I was told that a remake was being made of the famous film ""Jumanji"" (with the unparalleled Robin Williams in a leading role) from 1995, I was shocked. And certainly when it turned out that Dwayne Johnson hijacked the leading role. Yet another redundant and ridiculous attempt to imitate a past milestone.To my surprise, however, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" turned out to be an exceptionally successful experiment. And that's because of the unique idea to replace the ""Jumanji board game"" with an old skool console game where four innocent students are teleported into and where they need to complete a quest while playing a character in this game. It's the only way to escape the game. Not only was it a funny movie (due to the interactions and personality contradictions between the real youngsters and their avatar in the video game). The concept was also original. Adding video game features such as NPCs, cut scenes, and the fact that each character has a limited number of lives, was a masterful move. It's not without reason that the film was a real success in the theaters. And the inevitable happened. The sequel ""Jumanji: The next level"" is a fact.Unfortunately, as I feared, this new sequel doesn't take the saga to a new level. To be honest, I thought it was simply an uninspired story that simply tries to take advantage of the previous film's success. An easy solution to squeeze the last dollars out of a milked-out project. The novelties can be counted on a broken abacus. Not many, in this case. The characters are all still the same. This time supplemented with two old grumpy retirees (Danny DeVito and Danny Glover) who used to be business partners when they owned a thriving restaurant. As with every new level in a video game, the environment in which the adventure takes place is different from the previous level. So you'll be presented with a sandy location with associated oases. And also, our friends will encounter a completely different fauna on their path.The most successful aspect of this sequel is the fact that the different characters were initially mixed. That makes for hilarious moments when you see Dwayne Johnson imitating the characteristics of a Dany DeVito. But besides that, there's nothing innovative to discover in this sequel. It's a well-known story with a new look. It's the same as when a new ""FIFA Soccer"" version is being released on the game market. Graphically it may look a bit sharper and some new players and options have been added. But otherwise, the look and feel are similar and you have trouble discovering the points of improvement. Well, ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" was entertaining and packed with sometimes masterful CGI. A good alternative to fill a pleasant movie night. But the source from which creative ideas are created is exhausted. Let's hope they bury the game ""Jumanji"" in a well-hidden spot once and for all, so nobody can lay their hands on it again. I think we've had enough of this.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Jumanji - The Next Level
64,questl-18592,Jumanji: The Next One,6,29 January 2020,"The 2017 Jumanji was a surprise hit, coming out of nowhere to be a real fun action-comedy that was pretty obviously going to be visited again and again. It's a sequel, which means it's going to follow a similar formula as the first, switch up a few things and then amp everything up, which it does.Jack Black steals this one for me. He is hilarious and his turn as Fridge and then jumping back to Bethany highlights how sneaky good he is in this world. Karen Gillan was also a lot of fun. Visually it's on point, sounds good and is overall just a fun ride.On the flipside, the gimmick displayed in the trailer of the old men in the young bodies is definitely here and quickly becomes the most annoying part of the movie for me. A few jokes at the start would be fine but it just... keeps... going. I eyerolled multiple times watching this and that's not good.Balance those out and it ends up feeling like just an above average experience. There are moments of laugh out loud humor and fun action but they get counterbalanced by just ""ugh"" moments.Still, it's a fun experience and if you enjoyed the first one then thus is a no brainer and the reverse is also true.",Jumanji - The Next Level
65,aidanratesmovies,An Enjoyable Sequel,8,14 December 2019,"Although it is certainly not the best Comedy or sequel 2019 has to offer, Jumanji: The Next Level certainly has plenty to make it an enjoyable and fun time at the movies, and is even able to improve off of the points of its predecessor. What makes this film and the last one so captivating, and simply exciting, is the use of situational comedy and the actors performances of others inside their bodies. The film not only improves that fact here, by having different people take a part in it, but also doing the same as well. The main cast throughout the film delivers delightful performances, with the actual people they are portraying now being at least a bit better than they had been portraying their shallow characters from the first one. It is however, easy to forgive the last film from this flaw, as the characters continue to grow in the script in a slightly corny but mostly meaningful way you get to see on screen. The script can be a little messy at times, but its all for good fun, and although some jokes never seem to truly land, the film is plenty full of laughs to satisfy. In the end, the new Jumanji is hardly a perfect film, but it is better than the last, and as the franchise goes on, will hopefully continue to improve in the future.

66,adamjohns-42575,Level Up!,8,8 June 2021,"I enjoyed this one as much as 'Welcome To The Jungle'. It was a bit slow and I couldn't really see where they were going to start with, but once they all landed in Jumanji it was incredibly funny.I thought that Kevin Hart was superb in this one as Danny Glover's character Milo.Jack Black does a superb job as ""Fridge"" and as ""Bethany"". While the newest addition, Awkwafina as Ming made a fantastic Danny DeVito as Eddie, but didn't wow me as Spencer.If you want that to make sense you'll have to watch it. It's a shame that 'The Rock's' character doesn't lend itself too well to being the person who's playing as his avatar, because he has to be like a superhero from the start, but he doesn't do a bad job.It also brilliantly shows the generational gap between Grandparents and the youth of today. Sometimes it's a real struggle to explain everything, repeatedly.This franchise is so open to go on for ages with the right scripts.

The VERDICT:Overall, Jumanji's return was a very entertaining and decently balanced film. It somehow manages to make the familiar, same adventure we have known be fresh, with well written lines and humor to keep you engrossed in the film. For such a brisk pace, it manages to keep things well juggled, finding a nice medium between story, action, and comedy that it should be entertaining for most audiences. And with this cast that you get, well you will not be disappointed to see how well utilized most of the group is, something I can't brag about enough in this modern era of unbalanced delivery. Still, the film fails at the end to really capitalize on the story telling components, and has not quite achieved the full integration effect for me that I hope to see, especially given the weaker antagonist. Looking at this though, the movie is definitely worth a check out and I hope you guys give a theater visit given all the special effects and humor.A WORD OF CAUTION, if you are thinking of taking younger audience members be warned there is lots of strong language that little ears may repeat.

70,Kamurai25,"Jumanji with a dash of ""Game of Thrones""",6,5 July 2020,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.This is not the first movie, it is hardly close to me. They found a pretty fantastic formula with the first movie, and they had actors that could embody characters that weren't natural to their physique (mostly), which exemplifies the caliber of actors they selected for these roles.In this movie, the premise is so touching that I hope it is based of a true story that is important to someone who wrote / produced it. Honestly, otherwise, it is the thing I would cut from this movie. It gets in the way, the entire movie. Sure there are some cute moments where the old guys are just happy to be capable again, but ""old people not understanding what a video game is"" is a boring, if not frustrating, trope, and combining it with ""stuck in a realistic video game"", and having to explain it multiple times really took me out of the movie, repeatedly.The ""character switching"" (I'm pretty sure that was in trailers somewhere) also feels like they were just cheating, so it didn't feel as fulfilling where in the first movie they exploited the existing rules to win.Also the new characters, and the random character assignments we're very strong. Having a character make a poor choice (especially as a moose-understanding) is funny and satisfying: arbitrarily random isn't random so it's just forcing the audience to deal with something. Thinking back on it, the new characters, while not vital to most of the game, are similar to the other characters in having specialized roles, they were just sort of lacking in the same amount of humor, due to previously listed reasons.Definitely watch this, just don't expect the same experience as the first movie.",Jumanji - The Next Level

83,blott2319-1,"Not bad, but didn't live up to its potential",7,9 March 2020,"When I heard about the new Jumanji movie, all I wanted was for them to duplicate the formula of the last one, but mix up the characters. It feels like they set it up perfectly for this simple idea, and laid the groundwork for nearly infinite sequels that all feel unique, even though they are the same at their core. All you need is to have new people enter the game and inhabit the same characters, and we get to see how the actors handle new challenges. I was grateful to see that Jumanji: The Next Level at least attempted to deliver on that potential. The personalities do bounce around a little and we are introduced to a couple new players, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. This was where the majority of the comedy was added to the film. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart have a lot of fun presenting themselves as old men, and I thought they did a reasonably good job with it. Also, the personal history between these characters brought the main storyline that worked in the film, because we need something more going on than just the video game in order to keep us emotionally invested.I think where The Next Level fell short of the brilliance that so many of us found in Welcome to the Jungle is in the fact that they felt the need to bring back the same kids from the first movie. No one has long-lasting affection for Spencer or Bethany (if they even remember their names,) and frankly their problems were mostly resolved by the end of that film. It made no sense to use them again, and the writers had to reverse some of the growth they showed originally in order to justify their return to the game. I could see carrying over one experienced player, so you could shortcut some of the exposition and avoid all the aspects of learning how to play that were involved in Welcome to the Jungle, but that's all we needed. Make it fresh and new, with lots of external conflict that needs to be resolved in order to get them to work as a team so they can defeat the game. It seems so obvious, and yet they failed to see it. That being said, I still had a good time watching The Next Level. They found a bit of the magic from the prior movie, and earned some hearty laughs. It pales in comparison to what came before, but I still appreciate that they had moderate success.",Jumanji - The Next Level

This time instead of the tension coming from the ""Breakfast Club"" teen angst angle it comes from generational gaps and the inability to let go of long held grudges.Now don't get me wrong there is nothing particularly new here and some of the sheen has rubbed off since the first movie - we are no longer playing with a new toy here - but it is still very enjoyable.There are lame jokes and action scenes and new characters and fantasy landscapes.
Sure it is just people jumping around the place most of the time but it somehow managed to tap into that sense of adventure that much older films seemed to do so effortlessly.
Watching this did give me a sense of when I was a child and horizons were much further away than they are now.Great family fun!

88,one9eighty,The next level; similar to the last level - but with a new boss and a different background,7,6 July 2020,"Jumanji is back. Jumanji 3, or Jumanji 2 if ""Welcome to the Jungle (2017)"" was your first experience, brings the group back together again. It's been a year since the events of the previous film, the gang have all gone their own ways - even Spencer and Martha aren't talking much anymore despite connecting last film. Despite the year that has passed the game still has a way of pulling them back to Jumanji, with a couple of unexpected players added to the mix too. This time, the game has changed, instead of the jungle they are challenged with snowy mountains and arid deserts. New challenges and new dangers await the gang as they attempt to beat the game, in order to escape.Given that this, in video game terms, is the next level - Level 2, there is a marginal step up in difficulty for the players to deal with within the plot of the film. That being said though, I didn't think that the film pushed any boundaries, it was just a lot more of the same. I guess the question to be asked then is, why change a formula that seemed to work last time? Reboots don't often deliver successfully, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" bucked a trend and didn't disappoint audiences, so why go changing things drastically? The answer is it didn't; it was a little 'samesy' as the last outing - but that doesn't mean it wasn't fun though. This is a charming and fun film which would be suitable for family audiences. The cast all deliver fine performances, both as kids and as their video game avatars.The film delivered laughs and emotions, plenty of adventure, a little character development (from the first film) and, well, it was just simple and easy to watch - hardly rocket science, which in this instance is a good thing. I do not generally have any complaints, the film was decent for what it was, it delivered what was being advertised. It is neither better, nor worse than the previous instalment, and as such I'll give it the same rating of 7 out of 10.",Jumanji - The Next Level
89,educallejero,Skip it with a cheat code,3,17 November 2020,"The cliche ridden first movie (2017) was impossibly entertaining if not really great at anything besides that.So they decided to ruin it with two new characters, 70+ years olds, that took away the only really good thing that Hart and The Rock have going for them, their energetic comedic performances.With them going slow and boring, the jokes didn't land, even if they weren't different in style compared to the original. It infected the overall enjoyment besides some early and overused good jokes (old people doesn't understand video games and old people feel good in young bodies). Pile that with a worse rhythm, action set pieces, and video game story, and you get a really bad sequel.",Jumanji - The Next Level
90,rockman182,Jumanji: The Next Level (2019),7,16 December 2019,"I was hesitant about Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle when I first heard about it. After I saw it, I truly enjoyed the experience. It was funny, watchable for multiple viewings, entertaining, and creative. When they announced a sequel for it I didn't think it was necessary but was going to check it out regardless. The Next Level is not as good as its predecessor and has less laughs, however its a decent action adventure film that attempts to carry on a franchise.
The film takes place around the holidays where the group of kids from the first film get together. Spencer, goes back into the game of Jumanji after feeling unfulfilled and his friends join in. However, this time around Spencer's grandpa and his grandpas friend also enter. Also, this time around the game has changed. The stakes are higher and they have to play through a different level of Jumanji. The crew must band together and get into the right playable character to get themselves out of the dangers of the world of Jumanji.
The film is not as humorous as the first and feels like it has to tread similar ground, with things not being as fun the second time around. There are laughs though mostly through having the grandparent and friend personality shine through in the game. This film also explores different regions of Jumanji and is much more action and effects heavy. For what it is, its a fairly decent sequel though not as entertaining as the first. The addition of Awkwafina also helps the film.
Jake Kasdan tries to push his sequel and follow up the success of the first. It doesn't feel like its warranted but still makes for an entertaining time to close out a busy year in film. Some of it feels like it goes through the motions but for the most part the charm and work of the actors pushes the film to the finish line. I hope this is the end of it but I think the films success will definitely green light the next installment.

92,jon.h.ochiai,"No, It Doesn't Suck Getting Old",8,31 December 2019,"The crew is back in Writer and Director Jake Kasdan's ""Jumanji: The Next Level"", but with a new twist. Based on Chris Van Allsburg's book ""Jumanji"", Jake, Jeff Pinker, and Scott Rosenberg's screenplay revisits the Jumanji video game world in its next iteration, on ""The Next Level"". That expands the jungle scenario to include the arid desert and snowcapped mountains, along with the vicious villain Jurgen the Brutal, played by generically evil Rory McCann, who seeks some kind of dominance of Jumanji. In this 'next level' there are herds of terrorizing ostriches and baboons, and ominous castles. The cinematography of Gyula Pados is spectacular, as well as the various CGI effects.The game avatars remain the same: Kickass Ruby Roundhouse, played by Karen Gillan, Hero Dr. Smolder Bravestone, played by Dwayne Johnson, Nerdy Professor Shelly Oberon, played by Jack Black, and Zoologist Franklin Finbar, played by Kevin Hart. Yes, Martha, played by bold cautious Morgan Turner - the college student and ex-girlfriend of Spencer, played by Alex Wolff, resumes as Ruby in ""The Next Level"".Yet now, Smolder Bravestone is the avatar of Spencer's Grandfather Eddie, played by sweet crotchety Danny Devito. Frankin Finbar is the avatar of Eddie's estranged best friend Milo, played by kind Danny Glover. Confusing? Well, yeah.Apparently, a lot had transpired since 2017, when the teens returned from the video game world of Jumanji. It's Christmas. Martha enjoyed her single life (post Spencer-life) away in college. She has discovered her freedom. Jock Fridge, played with street swag by Ser'Darius Blain, is on football scholarship. 'It Girl' Bethany, played by whimsical Madison Iseman, studies abroad. Spencer attends NYU, suffering with his part-time job. Alex Wolff captures Spencer's charming uncertainty. The crew agrees to reunite back home at their favorite diner.Spencer returns home to find he's roommates with Grandpa Eddie, who's recovering from hip replacement surgery. 'Mr. Sunshine' Eddie tells his grandson, ""Getting old sucks!"" We get it.Life also sucks for Spencer since his break up with Martha. Attempting to relive the confidence and courage as Bravestone that won Martha's heart, Spencer returns to Jumanji. He had high-jacked the game, storing it in the basement. The Writers are truly reaching here. Just saying.Surmising what happened to Spencer, the Crew decides to go back to Jumanji. Fridge wisely says, ""Are you out of your mind?"" Well, if they listened to him, there would be no movie. Back in Jumanji, Martha's Ruby is all ""WTF?"" Bravestone is now Grandpa Eddie. Franklin is now Milo. So much for the romantic narrative for Martha. Well, sort of.Dwayne and Kevin amazingly channel Danny Devito and Danny Glover's personas, and their forsaken friendship that is both funny and touching. Bravestone catches his reflection of The Rock, handsome muscular swag. He says that he hasn't looked like that in years. Franklin replies, ""You never looked like that."" Hysterical.In the unexpected sweet moment, Bravestone and Franklin talk about the sadness of their lost friendship and mortality. No one does action Hero like Dwayne Johnson, The Rock. No one does smartass like Kevin Hart. They're funny together. They're screen partnership is all heart. That resonates throughout ""The Next Level"".Karen Gillan is genuine surprise. She displays the sense of humanity in all the craziness, embodying Martha's insecurities. Her Ruby can kick the ass of any man. Yet, all she really wants is to be acknowledged for who she is, which is a strong woman.Awkwafina joins the journey as another strong woman as flite thief avatar Ming Fleetfoot, with the initial surprising persona. Awkwafina deftly provides gravitas and humor as Ming, who seems to carry the movie's message: Life is a game. What makes it beautiful are those we get to play the game with.""Jumanji: The Next Level"" is fleeting entertainment. Totally fun. Big hearted. In ""The Next Level"": No, life doesn't really suck. Rather, life is the game you get to create. And that does not suck at all.",Jumanji - The Next Level
93,RforFilm,Jumanji: The Next Level can be best described as Grumpy Old Men if it happened to be an action video game movie,7,13 December 2019,"You know what any kid can relate to? Having to explain video games to adults, especially to seniors. Even I, an adult, can still have trouble when my grandmother wants an explanation of the news she hears about Fortnite or something about Nintendo. Looking at it from their perspective, I can't blame them. Video games are toys that are more complex and involve a level of storytelling that's miles away from the traditional ""Cowboys and Indians"" they played as children. Unlike a yo-yo or a Barbie toy that's self explanatory, video games always have different rules and instructions depending on it's genre. So how do you explain something that's always going to be different? I'd say it's best just throwing them in there and let experience be the guide.When it came to learning about game figuring out how to win, it was oddly the premise from Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. Yes, it may have been a sequel to the 90s classic, but it was also an enjoyable action movie that got several laughs out of me. It was a big enough of hit to gain a sequel. So how do you continue the story without repeating it? Jumanji: The Next Level doesn't repeat...but also does...in a good way.It's been a couple of years and the group of teenager from the first movie, Spencer, Fridge, Martha, and Bethany have all entered college and haven't seen each other in a while. Spencer is concerned that his dull experience in New York and sad demeanor will seem unimpressive compared to what his friends have done. Still, Fridge, Martha, and Bethany meet up at a restaurant to catch up, hoping that Spencer can talk about his troubles. They visit his house to find him, only to be greated by his grandpa Eddie (played by Danny DeVito) and another senior, Milo (played by Danny Glover).The teens go into the basement to find the Jumanji game they thought was destroyed repaired and figure out that Spencer went inside. But just as they touch the controller, they're sucked in without picking their characters. Martha is still Ruby (played by Karen Gillan), but Fridge is now Professor Shelly (played by Jack Black), Eddie is Dr. Bravestone (Played by Dwayne Johnson) and Milo is now Moose (played by Kevin Hart). Along with two old men confused with the new environment their in, the game has changed and they still don't know where Spencer is.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a movie I liked, but didn't love. Jumanji: The Next Level is about the same. There's a lot of different things I like...and elements that seem have not changed for no reason. To start off, Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart do a great job imitating Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. It's like watching Grumpy Old Men if it happened to be a video game action movie. And to see the other actors frustrate over their incompetence. Thankfully, they don't go on too long with that gag, though I can't say why without spoiling it.When the movie cuts to the real world, the scenes are also fine, though when it comes to the characters, I don't know why they put Spencer's character back to square one, making him out of his element. I know college is going to be a different experience for kids, but he was the kind of guy who would have gained confidence from that place, let alone from the Jumanji game. I was hoping they'd say he was going through depression or something more. But, nope, he was just feeling self-conscious...because the movie said to.The other teens don't have much in the way dilemmas their going through. This is probably why the majority of the story goes to Danny DeVito and his friendship with Danny Glover. It's a strange thing to put into the Jumanji series, but it works because both are phenomial actors.As a blockbuster, the movie has plenty of action and tries to continue the tradition of jungle animals out on the hunt. It's not as scary as the original Jumanji of the 90s, but I still had fun, especially within a sequence involving rope bridges and a ton of baboons.I'll give this seven Jumanji video games out of ten. This is an example of a movie that may have added new problems, but it also improves of a lot of things. I had fun watching this and I think a lot of families will have fun too. If you hear the drumbeats, it's Jumanji calling, so take a listen.",Jumanji - The Next Level

95,bankofmarquis,"A ""Game"" cast brings the fun in a sequel as good as the original",8,14 December 2019,"Did you enjoy the previous JUMANJI film where Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan were video game avatars of 4 teens sucked into a video game? It was alot of fun, an unexpected big hit and, inevitably, spun a sequel.Well...if you liked the last one, then you'll like this one, for JUMANJI: THE NEXT LEVEL pretty much delivers the same type of fun film, but avoids the cliches and lack of energy that a ""quickie"" sequel inevitably delivers.Credit for this should go to returning Director Jake Kasdan and a ""game"" cast that are ALL back from the previous film. While the plot is fairly similar (4 teens are sucked into a real-life video game where they can be trapped forever if they cannot ""win"" the game), the twist of adding 2 old folks (played in the real world by Danny Glover and Danny DeVito) almost derails the fun, but this winning cast and passably exciting action sequences steers this film into an enjoyable entertainment activity.I am a big Kevin Hart fan - and he does a great job of channeling Danny Glover in his character. He really brought the charm - and the funny - from the get go. He is ably assisted by Karen Gillan, who doesn't really have anything new to do, but brings the same ""kick-butt action with a wink in the eye"" characterization and energy as the first film. The surprise for me was Jack Black who I thought was very, very funny and energized. If anything, I thought his characterization was BETTER than the previous film. Only ""The Rock"" fails to equal his previous efforts - and he is just fine (he is ""The Rock"" after all). When you are talking about a team of actors playing against each other in an action/comedy and ""The Rock"" is the weak link, then you are in good shape.A fine addition to the proceedings is the always watchable Awkwafina as another character in the game while Nick Jonas returns as the avatar Alex and Rory McCann (the Hound in GAME OF THRONES) is very fun as the ""big bad"" in this film.The action scenes are fun, the characters are enjoyable to spend 2 hours with and the puzzle that they are trying to solve is clever (enough) that you will be able to pass a few enjoyable hours with your family this Holiday season.Letter Grade: B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Jumanji - The Next Level
96,fernandoschiavi,"Jumanji, it is, after all, exactly a new level of the same game, has good comedy and turns out to be sincere entertainment",7,31 January 2021,"Certainly, ""Next Level"", as in a good video game, keeps the main components of what came before, while adding enough new bits to keep things playable. Although this is a sequel with characters we already know and has an even more fun narrative dynamic, perhaps the most positive element of Jumanji - Next Stage is the addition of characters that know nothing about the world of video games - and that the public did not know until So. Again under the command of Jake Kasdan, the second chapter of the franchise mixes nostalgia with innovation and manages to be inventive at certain times, but still follows a conventional primer to entertain its audience.There are few conflicts in the plot as a whole, which certainly limits the film to taking big steps towards the more detailed development of that world or some character - with the exception of Danny Glover and DeVito, of course. The duo, which gives life to Milo and Eddie, respectively, bring unexpected layers to the production. I would even say that the heart of this film resides in the form and themes that both figures carry with a quick background that immediately puts a certain comic friction between them. However, this is never taken very seriously, because at all times we notice the care they have for each other. The veterans, in addition to giving a humorous freshness to the previous dynamic, not so repetitive, present their own interaction, rescuing a little of the classic discourse in the construction of messages in favor of breaking the pride and facing the past. The game becomes a catalyst for feelings and a new opportunity for a fresh start in a friendship. The script also, surprisingly, subtly discusses old age and its facets in the modern world. In this sense, inserting them in the midst of young people in a universe that is physically and metaphorically so hostile generates at least curious moments. Mainly, it happens because of the work of the group of actors, who represent the avatars, formed by Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillan and mainly Kevin Hart, who is priceless emulating Glover's antics.On the other hand, there is not so much brilliance in the core of young people who bring selectable characters to life, with Alex Wolff, Morgan Turner, Ser'Darius Blain and Madison Iseman still not having so much screen time and this decision doesn't seem to be free. Although none compromises, even for the simplicity of everything that presents itself, we are waiting for the moment that they will return to the game. Exactly the opposite of the scenes shared by Glover and DeVito. Thus, both in the imaginary world and in the mundane life, Milo and Eddie had beautiful and accurate outcomes. Also talking about the epilogue, the film has a post-credits scene that will make the most ardent fans of ""Jumanji"" thrill with joy.As it is a ""new level"", as the film's title already says, avatars have upgrades, although they still bring elements from the previous phase. While Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) was more adventurous, these novelties bring the film even closer to comedy, without forgetting, of course, the adventures involving animals - a trademark since the book published by Chris Van Allsburg in the 1980s. at this point, it is interesting to see that with the additions to the production, we see more versatility of the main actors, such as The Rock playing a grumpy gentleman, Hart giving life to a calm-spoken elderly, and even Black being a teenage athlete. Awakafina, in turn, also lives different personalities while playing Ming, the avatar of a thief within the game. The exchange of roles between the actors is one of the highlights of the feature and can generate a good laugh.Next Level is actually a DLC from the previous one, an expansion with new characters, scenarios, challenges and dilemmas, but that are still part of the same game, in this case, the same film. So, it is impossible to say that it is a continuity, no matter how much it tries to mature some relationships, they will be taken to the same ends, just as the gameplay will be about the same destination: ""Save Jumanji"". Thus, the same problems as the predecessor appear, in particular, the artificiality of the mission, which is the most uncomfortable. Even though it is ""intentional"" because it is artificial, being a game, it seems that this fact is used as a crutch for the film to be able to do what it wants. In addition to being a disservice to the entertainment modus operandi, it makes the world's previously established dangerousness rules useless. There is a scene in which two characters' fight and one takes a life from the other on purpose, even though each one has only two, as if they already knew that the last one would not be lost, and the previous film establishes that to die there is to die in life real. Another scene, in which another character, who comes close to the end without having lost any life, dies twice in the same trap, even though he already knows about its functionality, just to create an equality with the others. These are just examples to demonstrate how the film trivializes game aesthetics as a mere protocol. So, if it was already difficult to relate or care about the size of the adventurous journey previously, who knows now that it is already fulfilled.The plot is not really the strong point here, from bringing any excuse to return to the world of Jumanji until when then entered this universe, the objective is impossibly more generic. The villain Jurgen, The Brutal played by Rory McCann sums it up well. There is no problem in this case, as the story serves only as a guideline for humorous shots and action scenes that drink heavily from Professor Jones's adventures - the progress of the bridge with the monkeys, for example, seems to have come out of a sequence of the ""Indiana Jones"" saga. It is not by chance that the director and screenwriter is the son of Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriter of ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"". And in that sense, the set pieces are really great, especially taking on ostriches with an air of ""Mad Max"". A nice catch from the new Kasdan. These sequences, by the way, are extremely well executed, with exquisite action and comedy coexisting, helped even more by the excellent visual effects.Furthermore, everything is so well structured and, at the same time, light, that the characters without the human conscience of the players (multiplied in relation to the predecessor of 2017) assume their participation as an authentic comedy. Flame (Dania Ramirez), for example, has a visibly programmed sensuality and, in addition, Knife (Massi Furlan) is an unlikely brutality typical of a villain with a halter - without any chance to deviate from his perverse focus. Everything - absolutely everything - is developed with the main function of generating a plausible universe in itself. The action sequences within the video game are longer and take up more time than the previous adventure, giving the plot a real ""adventure game"" feel. The performances, the script (and his jokes), the visual effects that contribute to the result and are never there as mere artifice ... the whole set is part of something bigger, of Kasdan's proposal as director to make these films something, in fact, functional. On this side, realizing that even silly character comments can sound like an almost metalinguistic tool is fun. It is as if, when they discover what their new strengths can do and confess these discoveries aloud, they are giving voice to a gamer who, playing with his friendships - comments the same aloud.In the end, Jumanji - Next Level goes beyond comedy and action to deliver an exciting ending related to a character who knows himself better from the game's adventures. Therefore, it is curious that the person in question knew nothing of this technology, but he is more amazed than all the other characters. Technology embraced him in a simple and quite sincere way too, bringing a somewhat poetic message to those who pay more attention: the possibility of feeling embraced by a technology as archaic as it is engaging, which gives a new reality out of fear (whether to die or be forgotten). Jumanji's meaning reaches the level of representing the chance for freedom; not only physical but also emotional.Jumanji, it is, after all, exactly a new level of the same game. Or better: the original title refers to level. That said, it is the same story (or almost that), the same characters (or almost that) with an added difficulty for the players. These who, being the same (or almost that), act in a similar way, but with what they learned in the previous phase - at the level actually. The two films by Jake Kasdan manage, better than any other copy, to combine cinema and game in an organic way. This is because it is based on the union of the two and not on the transformation of each other. It's cinema with the heart of a game, but it's still cinema. Of course, it may be that you remain in a comfort zone by not moving the pieces towards direct interaction with the audience, but, in any case, it has fun and turns out to be sincere entertainment.",Jumanji - The Next Level

I was worried when I saw the trailer that it wouldn't be amazing. And unfortunately I was correct. The acting was terrible along with the story. No character development like the first one and no funny moments. It seems that this was rushed and not thought about more thoroughly. I honestly hated that I hated this movie. I really didn't want to. It was boring and I honestly gave it forty minutes before I skipped through it. I found that I had missed nothing and it was just still the same.

99,bob-the-movie-man,The Game Rebooted and just as fun.,7,27 December 2019,"One of the pleasant movie surprises of Christmas 2017 for me was ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"". I expected it to be a tired retread of the original classic, but instead it turned into a highly entertaining action comedy. Reading my review again, I was rather po-faced about it and scored it with a rather measly 7/10. But this rather belies my secret love of the movie: it is a film that I can invariably watch and enjoy again and again.This was also a film that raked in a HUGE return at the box office, getting close to the billion dollar number on its $90 million budget. During the spring of 2018, this was an almost permanent resident at the multiplexes (until ""The Greatest Showman"" and ""Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again"" took over the residence for the rest of the year!) . A sequel was inevitableWe rejoin the cast some time after the events of the first film, and the geeky teenage lovers - Spencer and Bethany - are trying, unsuccessfully, to carry on their long distance relationship while at separate colleges. Spencer is struggling mentally; lacking in confidence and momentum and desperate to feel like 'Smoulder' Bravestone again.On returning to his home town for the holidays, Spencer fixes the shattered game. But the console is unpredictable and when the game sucks people into Jumanji this time it's not just Spencer and two of his friends that go in, but Spencer's Grandpa Eddie (Danny DeVito) and his old friend Milo (Danny Glover).When they get there though, things have changed and the mission is a different one. A ""next level"" indeed!This is very much 'much of the same' from the first film. Yes, there's a different backdrop with desert and mountain 'levels' to play through. But the same fun, with exploding avatars and dangerous cake, is to be had again. The script team had to do something different here, and they did that by mixing up the avatars (including a surprising equine player) and throwing in the 'pensioners' to the mix. There is new fun to be mined here from the now nimble-again Eddie and the slow-talking and laconic Milo never quite getting to the point in time.The stars were all persuaded back for another ride. The four avatar leads (Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black and Kevin Hart) all return, together with the young teens (Alex Wolff, Morgan Turner, Ser'Darius Blain and Madison Iseman). Nick Jonas and his older real-life player Colin Hanks are back. Even Nigel ""Welcome to Jumanji"" Billingsley (Rhys Darby) returns, this time swapping his jeep for a plane.The newcomers to the cast are also welcome. Glover and DeVito are at their cranky best, and introduce a genuinely touching moment into the film. And a new avatar - Ming Fleetfoot - is fabulous in the form of Awkwafina, so brilliant in this year's ""The Farewell"".There's not much more to say on this. If you liked the original, you'll enjoy this one too. Many of the same jokes are trotted out again. The villain (here Rory McCann) is as forgettable as in the first film. It's not breaking any records in terms of originality, but the producers won't mind about that as long as it drags the crowds in again. At the time of writing it has made $320K on its $125K budget, so that seems to be working.Jake Kasdan is again at the helm. But I really hope enough is enough, and they leave it at this. The mid-credits scene might suggest though that greed is going to dictate a Jumanji 4 (or 5 in some people's books). The returns, I fear, from the franchise will be ever diminishing from this point forwards.(For the full graphical review please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.)",Jumanji - The Next Level
100,springfieldrental,Loved Every Minute of Jumanji 3,8,19 December 2019,"Sequels are the toughest acts to follow up on the originals and its successful successor. The Next Level turned out to be one of those rare breed of movies where it is just as good as its predecessor (s) was (were).
Paying Dwayne Johnson $24 million to play a video game character may be outrageous for some, but it was money well worth spending since he's the hub where the other characters revolve around. And fortunately for Kevin Hart, he was able to portray his zoologist role with aplomb before becoming severely injured in a car crash this fall.
Finally, it is simply amazing that filming began just this past May and wrapped up in time for the Christmas holiday. It is reasonable to suggest that all the CGI was largely finished by the time the actors went before the green screen.

They spend far too long establishing they've changed avatars, there is way too many obvious jokes and it just isn't funny. 30 minutes too long, uninteresting story and even some of the effects are low quality for today's standards. It was a complete bore & I felt nothing. The jokes were lame and the acting felt wooden. The rock was awful, more awful than usual. I thought this film was really bad, It was just a far less interesting and boring retrend of the 1st movie apart from the basis of the film being that the main characters have been swapped by old dudes in a fish out of water comedy routine that got old after the helicopter scene with the NPC. Even the plot set up as to why they went back into the Jumanji game was weak. The first film was much better in comparison. The first 20-30 minutes of this film is spent explaining to the seniors they are in a video game over and over again to the point its exhausting. I feel alone in that I loved the first film, found it hilarious and did not find this one as good. I was bored a few times and definitely did not laugh as much. Everyone else seems to have enjoyed it though, But I didn't enjoy Dwayne as Danny DeVito. I kind of found myself annoyed with the character instead of laughing.",Jumanji - The Next Level

One of the biggest differences comes with who inhabits each of the avatars this is so funny other characters playing other actors , as only Martha (Morgan Turner) gets the same character again in Ruby Roundhouse. Even she is greeted with some surprises, as those stuck in Jumanji learn that each of the avatars now has even more strengths and weakness.
This is a cool new feature I have game upgradeAs As for Wolff's Spencer, when he re-enters the game, he's no longer in Bravestone's body, but as a new character: pickpocket Ming Fleetfoot from Crazy Rich Asians star Awkwafina). Switching characters - each with their own unique skill set - simply adds to the schizophrenic quality of the sequel, which nevertheless feels entirely tiring it feels freshSwinging ropes level is the centerpiece of a thrilling adventure The action sequence which Eddie, Milo, Martha and Fridge are pursed by Mandrills on rope bridges which swing and timing is everything as they jump gaps while mandrill go for blood bridge to bridge which are separated thiis a stunning and this is best part of the film

Darby's return as the character with limited vocabulary (like any in-game character, he can only respond within certain parameters
But it's a treat seeing Dwayne Johnson act like Danny DeVito and Kevin Hart has a grand time mimicking an elder Danny Glover. Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) ends up in the body of Jack Black's Professor Oberon, and Black pulls off a delicate balancing act with a turn that could have been ""problematic."" No spoilers, but Jack Black is the MVP of this franchise, consistently underplaying outlandish characters so as to not rely on stereotypes. Where are Bethany (Madison Iseman) and Spencer? Well, no spoilers,
The famous international explorer Doctor Xavier 'Smolder' Bravestone is the main hero in the Jumanji video game. As a result, he is fitted with a plethora of abilities. Just like in the first film, Bravestone once again has strengths like speed and climbing. His use of a boomerang is also a strength of his, while intangible abilities include his fearless mindset and a patented ""Smoldering Intensity."" He does not receive any new strengths for The Next Level, but the sequel does give Bravestone his first and only weakness:The professor Shelly Oberon returns in The Next Level and Jack Black is class is the character who receives the most changes in the sequel. Oberon's strengths in Cartography, Archeology, and Paleontology return for this new adventure, but he is given a new strength as well: Geometry. This new gift is put to use in a pivotal section of the new level. His weaknesses once again include endurance, but his new ones are especially troubling at first. Oberon's new weaknesses include heat, sun, and sand, which doesn't bode well during a level. Transported to a desert called the Dunes to track down Jurgen, and after narrowly escaping a flock of pursuing ostriches, the group encounter Spencer operating as skilled thief Ming Fleetfoot, a new avatar, who agrees to help them after blaming himself for their predicament. While attempting to escape the Dunes, the group face new challenges and problems, along with collecting an in-game item called a Jumanji Berry, and discovering a pool of glowing green water that allows them to switch avatars.Alex, as his avatar Jefferson McDonough, and Bethany, operating a new avatar called Cyclone - a black horse that can only be understood by FinbarThe group infiltrate Jurgen's fortress separately to rescue teammates and steal the Falcon Jewel. Fridge and Bethany pose as the Brothers Kababik, two of Jurgen's allies, only to be exposed as impostors when one of Jurgen's men receives a message that the real Brothers Kababik were delayed. As a result, the confrontation turns into a battle, and Spencer pursues Jurgen to his airship, while the others distract his men. Finding himself unable to best Jurgen,
Ming Fleetfoot (Awkwafina) is one of the new playable characters added to Jumanji in The Next Level. She presents an entirely new skillset to the players, as she is a skilled thief. Her strengths include Cat Burglar, Pickpocket, and Safe-Cracker. Ming is introduced in the movie during a successful pickpocket and puts these other skills to use in the finale
Another new avatar in Jumanji: The Next Level is Cyclone the horse. The movie never states what Cyclone's strengths or weaknesses are, but there is one clear skill that the horse possesses. As revealed in final act, no spoilers here as its jaw dropping momentThe villain of Jumanji: The Next Level, Jurgen the Brutal (Rory McCann) is a conqueror of Jumanji who is attempting to grow his empire in the sequel.

Dwyane Johnson and Kevin Hart just stole the show with their electric chemistry here. Jack Black too was top on his game with Karen providing the necessary balance in the plot.
The performances are surely the highlight of it. Though I really wanted to see more from the 'Actual' real life versions of themselves. I find them a tad weaker here in comparison with the previous film. There's gotta be some applause for Smart Writing as well. The screenplay is well crafted with fast pacing and enthralling sequences. Although it became a bit predictable after a certain point but it never bored nor became tiring. As there is something in every scene whatsoever; whether it's action or comedy stuff. You get something in every sequence to cheer you up. A well directed and executed movie that should have a little bit more character depth and some twists in my opinion to Bring out the best in it.

If the movie spent less time on the needless dialogue between the characters trying to make the audience 'care' about the characters, and MORE time on the action and jokes in the movie, then this movie would have easily been a 7 or even an 8 out of 10 like the first Jumanji was.",Jumanji - The Next Level

This is what I think it needed a few more of, and it would've been a 9 easily. Without those extra scenes all you have to pay attention to is how bad of an impression The Rock does of DeVito (they really should've got someone who it looked like he was doing an impression of, especially since DeVito's part was small and could've been played by anyone, but who am I?).The movie is very watchable, so you should watch it.

What is clunky is getting them back into the game. And some of the jokes seem tired already, HOWEVER, even at his worst, director Jake Kasdan is still better than what's out there. Certainly than the Marvel flicks. And let's face it...with his Dad having a bug in his ear, you most definitely see the warmth and heart that was injected in his efforts, regardless of the retread of the good stuff that permeated his last flick. Look, if we were to dissect a classic like ""The Goonies"" (1984) we'd be here for a while rolling our eyes at their booby traps, so I sense this was made to give the new generation a movie to remember decades later as something worth watching for nostalgia. Although, even down to the Alan Silvestri-inspired score (dude, it's ""Predator"" (1987) soundtrack) I forgive much of the flimsy set-up because here is the secret...regardless of the action and adventure it is rooted in heart. And that is based on the relationship of Danny Glover and Danny DeVito. Two actors who put a TON of heart into the movie. And their moments add a lot of heart tugging moments. Which is what nostalgia is suppose to do. Because we are such a cynical society now, we do forget that the message of a lot of these movies are forgotten. Or just ignore. If it isn't about politics. This isn't. It's about humans. And that is what separates this movie from any other adventure one out there there.
We are lucky to have another Kasdan in the storytelling world, and though I gave this a middling rating, it is still a better adventure movie than our standards allow. This goes above it.",Jumanji - The Next Level

Although the action direction overall, could have been slightly better, tighter.They once again have fun with the fact that the characters ""in game"" represent characters in the movies ""real life"". And I am pretty impressed with how the actors fared. Maybe especially Dwayne Johnson. (I think he's taking some serious acting classes, he's getting better) Overall the cast in this is very likeable.I didn't feel quite that much that I was in a video game, this time around though.

And I'm not saying I hated it, but I really struggled to get into it.My main problem is the characters, I found a few of them to be far too jarring for my liking and just plain annoying. Milo in particular for a large part of the film was just frustrating to watch. It just didn't hit the same as the first. Also why the hell is Awkwafina now in absolutely everything. Becoming such a saturated actress already and it hasn't even been long.The humour I found to be a lot more forced than the 1st film, it didn't seem to flow as well and I sniggered a couple of times but that was really it.The plot itself I found ok enough, it was fun watch still and I did enjoy parts. The ending I found a little odd, I don't want to say anything that will ruin it, but there is one thing that I just found weird and really out of touch with the whole plot.The film came out 2 years after the first and you could tell. It had that feel of it being forced out, because they knew it would sell.What made the first so great was the humour and the overall enjoyment of the journey that the characters made. This instalment just lacked on them fronts this time.Listen, it's not a bad film. I know I've basically just slated it, but I did enjoy watching it. It just could have been so much better. I feel like if they took their time with it this could have been really really good. It is what it is I guess.

This movie made me laugh, hard, and a lot. It is well crafted, but does rely a bit much on the same elements that made the first such a success.

My Dad, my brother and I thought it was a classic when we first saw it in the cinemas. When Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was released in 2017, I had serious concerns that this was going to flop at the box office. I was proved wrong as I had an amazing time in the cinema. A sequel was inevitable so now we have Jumanji: The Next Level which was fun from start to finish.The quartet from the previous movie return as Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman), and Martha (Morgan Turner) reunite over the holidays after having gone their separate ways. While Spencer stays at his mother's house, he also has to live with his grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito). Bored one night, he inadvertently reactivates the game console and once again finds himself sucked into the Jumanji game. Upon learning of Spencer's situation, his friends reluctantly re enter the world of Jumanji to rescue him, and take on the characters from the previous game. The four characters of the game are the muscular Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart), Commando Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Cartographer Dr. Shelly Oberon (Jack Black). This time, Spencer's Grandfather Eddie is Dr Bravestone and Eddie thinking he has died being in an unfamiliar world. Eddie's friend Milo (Danny Glover) has also found himself inadvertently sucked in also and finds himself in the role of Finbar. Bethany is overjoyed that she gets to play as Ruby Roundhouse, however Fridge is less than thrilled that he has taken on the role of Dr Oberon. Jumanji's guide Nigel (Rhys Darby) pops up to tell them about the new rules of Jumanji and what their main objective is. The quartet manage to find Spencer however he is now a female thief named Ming Fleetfoot (Awkwafina ). Left out of the game, Morgan enlists the help of Alex (Colin Hanks) who is now living a quiet life after being freed from the world of Jumanji having been imprisoned there for many years. Alex adopts his previous character Jefferson ""Seaplane"" McDonough (Nick Jonas) and Morgan is a horse named Cyclone who can only be understood by Finbar. The world of Jumanji is now taking place across the desert, the tropical jungle, and the snowcapped mountains. The team also find themselves against a new threat, this time an evil conqueror named Jurgen the Brutal (Rory McCann) who is also in possession of the Falcon Heart, a magical necklace which can end a massive drought that Jumanji is currently suffering under.Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan pick up where they left off from the previous movie and they still do an awesome job. Even with the changes in their alter egos they are still a crack up and had the audience in the cinema laughing.To sum up Jumanji: The Next Level in a word: fun. It's not the same as the first two sequels, but it's still fun. There was a few moments which stretched things a but thin, but I was having too much fun during the movie.I don't know if there will be a fourth movie, but never say never. I just hope the novelty doesn't wear thin.Sit back and enjoy the fun watching Jumanji: The Next Level. You won't be disappointed.7/10.",Jumanji - The Next Level
130,akcenat,Another example of why most films have no means to justify being 2 hours long,6,25 July 2020,"Taking place about a year after the events of 'Welcome to the Jungle', 'The Next Level' starts off pretty slow as the characters from the last movie reunite over winter break. Main problem with this film is that there are no sense of escalation (next level), with each set piece almost instantly collapsing into a busy spectacle of eluding stampeding animals, running across rope bridges and taking on waves of enemies. There are few hilarious scenes paired with a good dose of adventure, but this predictable film fairly succeeds in recreating the magic from the 'Welcome to the Jungle'. It's just a shame that after that surprisingly successful revival, 'The Next Level' doesn't raise the franchise anywhere above that level. The last part of the movie feels narrative rushed and the ending does not hit as hard as I think director/producers hoped it would. Clocking in at 129 minutes, this felt longer than it had to be, while Awkwafina just seem wasted here. Ultimately, I did enjoy ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" more than ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" - which is WATCHABLE, but somehow lifeless fun. To conclude, if you are expecting a fun film, it isn't the worst option, but it definitely isn't the best.Rating: 6+",Jumanji - The Next Level

132,stevenrotherforth,The inclusion of Glover and Devito is an inspired idea,8,4 April 2020,"Jumanji: The next levelIf you liked 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' chances are you're going to enjoy this one too.
'The Next Level' follows the winning formula of its predecessor but injects some new life into the franchise with the inspired inclusion of Danny Devito and Danny Glover.
The original gang are all back and have to renter the Jumanji game to rescue one of their friends.
The two old timers are also dragged into the game making for some comedy gold.
A criticism I had with the first movie is that whilst other cast members mimic their real world counterparts, Kevin Hart just played himself.
Not in the sequel as his impersonation of Danny Glover is hilarious and Hart steals many a scene.
Not to say everyone else isn't brilliant. Particularly actress Awkwafina who's impression of Danny Devito is uncanny.
Jack Black is a safe bet when delivering the comedy goods and Dwayne Johnson proves once again he's much more than just a mass of muscle.
Here Karen Gillan cements the fact that she's brilliant in everything she's in.
Not to mention she's absolutely gorgeous too.
It was nice to see The Hound from Game Of Thrones in something else. Rory McCann has he's known to his family and friends gives The Rock a run for his money.
McCann doesn't have much screen time but he does what he can as the main villain.Director Jake Kansan has cleverly steered 'Jumanji: The Next Level' away from being just another retread.
Of course it is much of the same but has enough new ideas baked in to keep the franchise fresh.
Question is can they pull this off if the studio decides to make another instalment?
With a worldwide gross of over $795 million chances are Johnson, Hart, Gillan and Black will be returning for more.In terms of audio and visual quality this film looks incredible. For all you grain haters out there rest assured this film boasts a digital crisp 4K image.
There's the odd soft shot here and there which is to be expected with a heavily CGI laden movie such as this.
For the most part detail is stunning. Colours are vibrant and punchy.
An extravaganza for those rocking a TV with HDR and Dolby Vision.
Sound is equally good. A film that needs a good Home Cinema System to allow the movies sound mix to shine.
So is this movie as good or better than its predecessor?
'Welcome To The Jungle' took the world by surprise.
It was better than it had any right to be and audiences lapped it up.
'The Next Level' May not have that element of surprise but it's still a hugely entertaining and successful sequel. Which is best is a tough question that doesn't really need to be answered. Just enjoy them both back to back.",Jumanji - The Next Level

Won't say who it was, but if you're older than 20, chances are good you like the person.The action is like last time, it's entertaining, but not mind blowing. The effects are overall good. The Rock has some, lets call them punching scenes, which I liked. Although the action direction overall, could have been slightly better, tighter.They once again have fun with the fact that the characters ""in game"" represent characters in the movies ""real life"". And I am pretty impressed with how the actors fared. Maybe especially Dwayne Johnson. (I think he's taking some serious acting classes, he's getting better) Overall the cast in this is very likeable.I didn't feel quite that much that I was in a video game, this time around though. Felt more like just an adventure, than an adventure videogame. They could have hammered home a little better.
So yeah, I was entertained, but it's pretty shallow and won't stick with me like, say, the origianl Jumanji. (I watched that as a kid, and it was kind of revolutionary, so of course it stuck) Nice family flick.",Jumanji - The Next Level

In the rare occasion that sequels are just as good as their predecessor, ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" really nails it and keeps things interesting.

It's really delightful to say that this is a great entertaining adventure comedy that is actually funnier than the last one.! This time, we catch up with Spencer, Martha, Fridge and Bethany as they have gone their separate ways. They plan to meet up together again which is disrupted by Spencer rediscovering the Jumanji video game again and they have to go back into the game to get him back! The game has expanded even more so and they have to face a perilous journey to find their friend and the Stone that will return them to reality. So the story isn't quite as engaging as the previous film which is its only real downfall apart from an uninteresting villain which the first did suffer from a bit also. But what's raises this up is the proper belly laughs and just great performers 😀 the central crew of Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) Professor Sheldon Oberon (Jack Black) Franklin Finbar (Kevin Hart) and Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan) are just great on screen together and you can feel how much they must get on in real life. There's also brilliant inclusions here of Danny DeVito and Danny Glover as the old folks and in particular Awkwafina as Ming Fleetfoot who does an amazing job and that's as far as I can say without spoiling anything. Kevin Hart is also a huge stand out here; his character goes different places here that are genuinely hilarious. A massive surprise and just a damn good adventure flick.

142,Cinema_Fan,Too many snakes and not enough ladders.,3,7 December 2019,"Carrying on from the preceding chapter, we are now immersed within the next instalment that is Jumanji: The Next Level. And what a linear level this is. After the overall outline, and outcome, of the interesting first period we are succumb to a rather dislodged affair of what, at best, can only be described as a Kentucky Derby of low standard, puerile and noticeably immature game to catapult this embarrassing farce; To enthral is target audience that, as seen, has now dropped to a lower age of understanding that this witless wonder is demeaning of any sense of wit and imagination. This is not merely poor execution of script, at its very core, it is at a level that does not hold its audience in any regard for its art; lazy is too cliché at best, this is a level of the lowest form of direction and experience in film.Once more, we have all the four friends of the previous quest cantering along in the frolics of a new adventure; a new game and fresh locations and each being mixed and stirred with avatars that are based on, and around, their last gathering, at least.It is in this new gathering that we see the dreary four and we bear witness to a small group of friends, who lacking in chemistry, charisma and charm, produces simply too little screen presence here to fill the audience with delight and wonder; it's all a tedious affair, even to the point of adding new faces to the game, Messer's Awkwafina, Glover and DeVito, and their respective personalities', cannot pull this from the quagmire of its astonishingly dull script and poor lacklustre avatar building disaster. There simply is no true aura, no honest connection amongst this new mindset between the players; What was once had is now, regrettably, misplaced and removed. Age has most certainly refused to gather pace but placed a regression of personality and having receded into childlike banter and juvenile charade.

starring: Dwayne Johson,Kevin Hart,Jack Black,Karen Gillan,Awkwafina,Danny Glover,Danny Devito,Madison Iseman,Morgan Turner,Alex Wolff,Nick Jonas,Rory Mccan,Colin Hanks,Rhys Darby,Ser,darius Blaine etcoverall rating 46/100Jumanji the next level is based on the gang growing up and being in different situations. But after Spencer goes back into the game of jumanji the gang must go back to find him. But with the game being faulty some things go wrong and the gang must embark on a new adventure. Despite a few good moments Jumanji the next level did not work for me on most levels let me tell you why.First of all i loved that there was some good character arcs throughout the film.
It was interesting to see how all the younger characters had developed and grown since the previous film. Spencer once again was the most interesting character and the breakdown of his relationship with Martha ( Morgan Turner) was explored and developed well. Even the two veteran actors Danny Devito and Danny Glover had a fun arc throughout.Next i just have to make a little sign of appreciation at the sheer star power in this film. As they had the great cast before as well as new actors as well. Karen Gillan despite not being as strong as the first film did a solid performance. As well as to be expected both of the Dannies being fantastic as well. But my key standout out of the cast was Awkwafina. She was a truly fantastic added member of the cast. She bought a lot of charm and wit to the film. And she bought one of the few humourous performances of the movie with a fantastic Danny Devito impression.Further developing on my previous point the film just wasn't that funny. Apart from a few key moments the film just was nowhere near as funny as the first. With a large majority of it not landing. Making the film very awkward to watch which was a shame as the film is marketed as a comedy, so this was a disappointment. And another thing was that the film was very stereotypical of old people. Danny Devitos charecter was portraying a very stereotypical side to the elderly. Making them appear weak,grumpy and clumsy. This didn't land well for me and i did not find it funny. This was a shame as his character was interesting towards the final act of the movie.Next i thought that they added just enough new set locations and plot for this to be a justifiable sequel. The New locations of the snowy mountains and the new villages was interesting to explore and one of my favourite scenes came with the mandrills which was admittedly great to witness. And there was enough interesting new characters and arcs that distracted you from the negative that i am now going to tell you. The plot was just to similar to the first one. A lot of the scenes were just repeated from the first film but just with different characters interpreting different people. And a lot of the repeated plot points like Karen Gillans dance battles didn't land as well and lacked the same charm as the first.My next two negatives for me would be the repetitive use of body switching and the slow pacing. for this film they had the characters interpretating different people. But this time they made the characters switch multiple times to different characters. This was overused,repetitive and just over complicated a plot that didn't need another weakness to it. And the film was incredibly dull and slow for a large majority. If i am honest the first 75% of the film plodded really slowly and there was a lot of boring scenes with characters honestly not doing a lot. Even the action sequences were largely underwhelming until the final act.However my final positives would be the true star of the film alongside Awkwafina, Kevin Hart who bought the large majority of the much needed and lacking humour. His impression of Danny Glover was fantastic. He captured the essence of his character perfectly. Leading to him being a scene stealer with his hilarious remarks and personality traits of talking to slowly and forgetting things. And finally the final act was very entertaining. When all the characters returned to there original characters the film really picked up. Unfortunately it was a bit to late for the film but they saved themselves slightly. As the final confrontation with the villain was good. And the action and humour finally was starting to improve. So its a shame they only started getting it right in the final act. But it restored my faith that if they did another film i would enjoy it if they followed the formula of the final act consistently throughout.My final negative and my main reason why i think this film didn't work, was because none of the cast had the same charm as the first film. None of the cast had the comedic chemistry of the first film. They all appeared really awkward and it almost seemed like they didn't know what they were saying half the time making it seem awkwardly improvised. And Jack Black was a massive disappointment. His impression of Fridge throughout the large majority of the film. Was a big turn off for me as it was irratating and a white actor playing a younger black actor was awkward and even offensive in places. And Dwayne Johnson was massively disappointing. Which is a shame as 90% of the time he is fantastic. His interpretation of Danny Devito was terrible and made me cringe. And he came across as a bafoon and stupid. And his repeated humour became repetitive and stale very quickly.Overall despite a few good character arcs and comedic moments. And some key standout performances. Jumanji the next level did not work. The humour fell flat,the plot fell flat and the cast did not work well together. They tried something different and for me it didn't work.",Jumanji - The Next Level
144,gavinp9,"Good, fast-paced family comedy",7,26 December 2019,"'Jumanji: The Next Level' is technically the fourth 'Jumanji' film, but the second of the new sequels, with all the main four back - Martha/Ruby (Gillan), Bethany/Sheldon (Black), Spencer/Bravestone (Johnson) and Fridge/Franklin (Hart). They obviously get sucked into the game again, but for a stupid reason - and this time, Eddie (DeVito), Milo (Glover) and Ming (Awkwafina) are along for the ride too.The concept is pretty much the same, with most of the comedy coming from the actors playing the ""real life"" versions of themselves, which is funny when it's The Rock acting like Dany DeVito. Kevin Hart talking really slow like Danny Glover is great to watch. Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, as Eddie & Milo come to terms with the video game they're in. It's also good to have Nigel (Darby) and Alex (Hanks) back and Awkwafina is funny as usual, but doesn't get too much screen time.Some new settings, with the desert when they first enter the game and snowy mountains for the final act. It's obviously left open for another film, but it does fly by and seems like less than 2 hours. It's fun and easy to like, with not that many flaws, once you suspend believability. I think focusing on Martha & Spencer is OK and the story of Milo & Eddie is very nice. The Rock has less to do and the first half is mostly carried by Black and Gillan, which works for the film.",Jumanji - The Next Level

Spencer is not doing well and having saved the old game console from total destruction he disappears and his friends realise he has gone back inside the game. Off they go to rescue him. So that was a little bit confusing. Forget who was in which body last time, and open your mind to the wonders that include Danny de Vito inside Dwayne Johnson's body. There is some superb acting from Dwayne as we totally see the character of Danny throughout. He's becoming a great comedic talent. Oh and he still smoulders.

150,WalkdenEntertainment,An Entertaining Installment With Fresh New Concepts...,7,15 April 2020,"Welcome to the official third instalment to Jumanji. Once again, this film follows young Spencer (Alex Wolff) but this time Spencer is struggling with a few personal issues including a recent break up with his girlfriend. Spencer also lives long distance from all his close friends. We soon discover that Spencer still has the smashed up and busted Jumanji video game console from the previous film. Spencer attempts to repairs the console and manages to renters the world of Jumanji. Soon his friends figure out Spencer's recent activity and decide to also renter the game to try and rescue their friend. But this time the game is different; Jumanji is a different world. The players and the avatars have also changed. The players will venture through the Jungle, Desert & Snowy Mountains while looking for Spencer along the way.As a third instalment I was generally excited to see this film. For those who are curious, I gave the last instalment, Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle (2017), a score of 7.0/10. It was creative, fun and a worthy sequel to the 1995 film - RIP Robin Williams.Thankfully Jumanji: The Next Level (2019) brings new and fresh ideas to the screen. There are new elements introduced to make this video game world more relatable for 2019. Plus! While actors are the same, their personalities are different this time. This was exciting and fresh to see, particularly when it came to the actors Dwayne Johnson & Kevin Hart.While there are many elements that are fresh, there are minor issues with the film. Some of these include a weak and forgettable villain. While I enjoyed The majority of this film, it also feels far too long, especially when you reach the third act. This act also didn't carry the same level of humour or pacing in my opinion.Overall, considering this is a third instalment to the world of Jumanji, I'm proud to say it's another positive film for the franchise. While the level of creativity is higher, I only had a few personal issues with this film including a weak villain and that the film's general run time was a bit long. No matter my opinion, there's still plenty of fun moments to have here. I'm honestly excited and curious to see if the creators of this film will roll the dice for a 4th instalment. 6.9/10 - Walkden Entertainment",Jumanji - The Next Level

This film is directed and partly written and produced by Jake Kasdan, who also directed the second Jumanji film.The friends from the previous film discover that the Jumanji game broke down. Spencer (Alex Wolf) tried to repair the game with his own hands, but got stuck in the game. The friends decide to go back into the game themselves to save Spencer. Once back in the game, the friends learn that they are in the body of a different avatar than the last time. Two new players also traveled with the friends into the game, namely Spencer his grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) and his friend Milo (Danny Glover). The friends need to explain to the new players what's going on and learn what they have to do in the game this time, to finish the game and be able to return to the real world.
With this new film they have expanded the world of the game by bringing the characters to new places such as arid deserts and cold snowy mountain areas. All these new locations provide new opportunities for suitable action scenes. Despite the new entertaining action scenes, the humor and comedy of the film still comes across as predictable and repeated. The best comedy comes from putting the characters in other avatar bodies. This way you have the little Danny DeVito in the body of the big muscular Dwayne Johnson. Also the quiet older Danny Glover in the body of the busy Kevin Hart.For the new locations in the film, they have really traveled to places to film here such as Canada and New Mexico. With the animals in the film you can still see that they were placed in the film with CGI, just like with the previous film. Because the film is set in a video game, they can use this as an excuse, just like they did in the previous film.The acting is also well done by the cast. It is nice to see the actors now playing their characters in a different way by putting the characters in the different avatar bodies. The film loses some comedy that came to the fore in the second part such as a popular teenage girl in the avatar body of Jack Black. It is special to see Kevin Hart playing a quiet role with the older Danny Glover in the body of his avatar.

There are some sequences that don't seem to have any real sense or purpose and are not very funny or interesting, like the whole ""switch players while bathing in green goo"", which actually happens _twice_ in the movie...Of course, part of it is because the concept has already been explored in the first movie, so it's not as interesting this time around. But, still, they could have done it a little better, rather then trying to do it ""a little less"".On the plus side, Kevin Hart does a _great_ impression of Danny Glover.While it's an OK watch, I don't think it improves on the experience you get from the first movie and I don't believe you can fully enjoy it without watching the first movie, so, I would not recommend watching it.",Jumanji - The Next Level

It had the chemistry, had the jokes, the acting and a whole new concept. And what happened then? Two years later another sequel popped up and it has become exactly what I was so afraid it would turn up to be - another cashgrabber. The next level shows no potential, no signs of any originality; old characters haven't changed one bit and in tryings to bring the tension and drama between them they forgot one simple truth - that the characters are supposed to be alive and easy to sympathize. Did I believe in Spencer's inner problems of self-identification? No chance. All the rest of the characters don't even have that. The new characters, played by two Dannys, DeVito and Glover, have like two minutes of screen time and then they continue their tenure in the videogame which is hardly a tenure to begin with, just some ""sucked out of the pinky"" issue that resolves itself as quickly as this movie came out. The jokes are still there but they're mostly connected with the new characters and their new avatars and I have to admit Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson are at their height here again which I can't say about the others. Overall the movie plays it safe and is therefore dull and, I repeat it once again, brings absolutely nothing new to the table. Did we really need a Jumanji franchise?!",Jumanji - The Next Level

It turns out that The Rock can only play himself. I genuinely cringed 2 or 3 times at some of his accents.

173,RhapsodyReviews,"Still Fun, Though Slow at First.",7,28 December 2019,"Review:
'Jumanji: The Next Level' is a action adventure-comedy film directed by Jake Kasdan. It is the second sequel to 1995's 'Jumanji', following 2017's 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle', and the third installment, overall, in the 'Jumanji' franchise.
I re-watched the first movie, just to refresh my memory. And after watching the new one, I must say - it wasn't underwhelming at all! Another great film from the world of Jumanji. The stakes feel higher and the comedy is still great.
This time, the adventures continue in the fantastic world of Jumanji, where nothing is what it seems to be. The players must return to the dangerous game; however, their characters have exchanged with each other leaving us the same heroes but with different looks. Moreover, they must find out where the rest of the players are in order to beat Jumanji again.
The gang is back together again, and you would expect everybody to be on par with what we've seen from the first film. Unfortunately, Dwayne Johnson doesn't seem in his A-game acting like Danny DeVito. It seems like everybody else was more comfortable with changing their voices to suit their counterparts that differ from the first, but Dwayne Johnson did not seem as comfortable as the rest of the cast.
This movie does not have a deep story, and doesn't try to be anything more than it is, this movie makes you laugh, keeps you entertained and ensures you leave the theater feeling happier than you went in. They added different skills and weakness for all the characters which brought lots of fun and laughs as well. The movie did take a while to get into, and I wasn't fully intrigued until the thirty-minute mark, but then the movie really takes off.
Overall, the movie does take a while to get going, but when it does it goes full force. Some of the characters bring a lot of laughs and entertainment while other take a bit to get used to. Either way you will have a great time with this movie, and I think it is a good sequel.

Naturally, I already had certain expectations before Next Level and to be honest while this movie didn't dazzle me as much as its predecessor, it had its big moments of fun and excitement.Trying to build up on what worked in the previous film, the creators added 2 new characters and a couple of interesting ""in-game"" mechanics. One thing they did well is capture the concept of old people not understanding video games and with that being said it was nice to watch Kevin Hart actually act and play someone else besides Kevin Hart. Rock on the other hand, was not up to the challenge despite packing a truck of charisma and energy which compensated for his acting skills.On paper, Next Level is only 4 minutes longer than Welcome to the Jungle, but because of its flow and occasionally butchered humor it ends up feeling like its half an hour too long. Still, there is nothing to dislike about this movie and the positives greatly outnumber the negatives so if you enjoyed the previous part, then I would recommend to catch this one too as its perfect for friends and family.",Jumanji - The Next Level

193,eelen-seth,"Grandpa Eddie: ""Meh""",5,14 December 2019,"Where 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' was a genuine surprise full of wonderful twists and unexpected turns that also acknowledged the original board game film by playing homage to it, 'The Next Level' feels like a watered down rehash of what we've all seen before. Once again, Jumanji is ready to battle Star Wars at the holiday box office, but this time it seems the Mouse House will win. Luckily Mr. Johnson has his next film 'Jungle Cruise' lined up, which also takes place in the wilderness, and is made by Disney.Jumanji: The Next Level takes place a year after the events in 'Welcome to the Jungle'. Spencer (Alex Wolff) is an insecure loner at NYU, ignoring incoming calls from his long distance girlfriend Martha (Morgan Turner), who's seemingly having a great time on her own. Bethany (Madison Iseman) is on her way back home for Christmas, after taking a gap year on the other side of the world, while Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) has been spending most of his time at the gym. Spencer is surprised to find out he'll be sharing a room with his grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) - who recently had hip surgery - and realises life didn't turn out the way he wanted after high school. While trying to fix the game, he gets sucked back in and it's up to his friends to once again save him from the different challenges in Jumanji.Co-writer and director Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher) is back to helm his sequel to the box office juggernaut. But while he tries to refresh the story, by introducing new ways the avatars in the game are able to interact and change, he also forgot to make it interesting and to not just repeat exactly what he did in the previous film. The film drags when there's no action on screen, and is just not as funny, since there's nothing new to begin with. The three big action sequences, involving mostly animals, are exciting and riveting, but the overuse of CGI looks too fake when you are dealing with life-like avatars in a game.Not just the director and writers are back, but also the entire cast, with some new and welcome additions. What has been a wonderful year for Awkwafina, after her success with small film 'The Farewell', is getting even better when proving she's the best part of this blockbuster. The hysterical cat-burglar Ming is just the type of character that felt fresh and though-through. Another new character in the game is a horse, and even that one has more surprises than good old Dwayne Johnson (Fast & Furious: Hobbs and Shaw). He's unfortunately the weakest link in the film, with nothing more than just changing up his mannerisms and voice, there's not much else that changes him from every other part he's ever played before.Karen Gillan (Avengers: Endgame) and Jack Black (The House With A Clock In Its Walls) are comical and get the most screen time. Both are pleasant to look at and get the best lines, especially when their characters aren't exactly what they seem from the previous film. Comedy legend Danny DeVito (Dumbo) plays newcomer Grandpa Eddie and is typically DeVito, which diehard fans will thoroughly enjoy.Jumanji: The Next Level isn't just repetitive and never ending, it's just not as crisp as the beautiful white snow our characters walk on. Besides a few laugh-out-loud jokes and the inevitable by-drums-preceding heavy action packed sequences, this sequel feels lazy and not worthy of its predecessors which both tried and succeeded changing up the adventure-genre. An overlong third chapter in the Jumanji-franchise that Grandpa Eddie would label as just... meh.Originally published on intoscreens",Jumanji - The Next Level

Welcome to the Jungle was such a breath of fresh air, filled with great performances from our four leads, who return for this film. Hart is given so much more to do and is very entertaining to watch, Black is yet again phenomenal, while Gillan, Jonas, DeVito, and Glover are also amazing. The Rock shines, but he felt much more fleshed out in the previous film, while Akwafina felt underutilized.

198,samyoung-82648,Average at best (and it's woke-free),5,10 December 2019,"This film is woke free. The movie had no signs of identity politics. The writer(s) and director(s) deserve credit for bucking the Hollywood trend.I enjoyed the last Jumanji movie. It was silly, filled with action and had some decent scenes where characters got to know their new bodies. The second movie follows the same basic model, however, it misses the mark by a wide margin. The film is not fresh nor is it interesting.The main problems with this movie are that you don't feel any investment in the characters and nothing particularly interesting happens other than some low-brow jokes that mostly miss the mark. At each stage, I found myself predicting what would happen next and I was fairly close in my predictions. Also, the final 15 minutes were fairly boring. There was no interesting climax. I kept on waiting for the film to finish.What probably tipped this movie from being very good to average was the acting. With some re-shuffling of bodies to characters from the last film, people like the Rock had to play a different personality that's not their usual role. The actors just couldn't pull it off. I believe better actors were needed to swap personalities from what we saw in the last film. Kevin Hart was just not funny at all and he usually makes me laugh, or at least smile.This Christmas box-office will be interesting. A mediocre Star Wars and mediocre Jumanji.

I was especially impressed by the improv the Rock, Jack Black, Awkwafina, and Kevin Hart did for their characters in different bodies. That had me laughing the whole entire time! There were a surprising number of twists involving who was in the game and what character they were portraying. And something happened near the end that ALMOST had me sobbing (then again I don't really cry, but it did have me feeling sad) which I won't spoil. There's some redundancy in this movie, but it didn't bother me at all.

201,theredsky,Jumanji: The Next Level Review,5,29 December 2019,"The original Jumanji from 1995 is dated but fun. The sequel from 2017 is not good but the 2019 sequel is slightly better than it. This film has basically the same plot as the original although it does differentiate in a few places but its repetitiveness leads the film to be predictable. I was able to predict what was going to happen before each ""level"". Since I felt it was predictable, I did get bored during some sequences. The film has a noticeable lack of tension due to its repetitiveness and predictability. I knew the characters would be fine and make it out of each situation okay. The script is nothing too good either. It isn't terrible but I felt it lacked a little bit of charm and caused some of the jokes to feel a little forced although a handful of jokes got a smile or chuckle out of me. The video game characters played by Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart did a pretty good job. In the first film, they had to impersonate only one character but in this film they had to impersonate two or three and I felt they did a great job at that. In the first film, I felt Jack Black was the only funny character but in this one Jack Black and Kevin Hart were the funniest ones. Gillan and Johnson were able to get a laugh out of me though in a couple of areas. Unfortunately, the acting from the real life characters, besides Danny DeVito and Danny Glover, was not so great. They do not have any chemistry together and just felt awkward around each other. The action set pieces are new and unique in some areas but similar and repetitive in others. They were entertaining yet a little boring at the same time. Some of the technical aspects are just okay. The music is bland and boring but the cinematography is serviceable. The visual effects were mostly below average in the first one but they were better here although very shotty in a few areas. Overall, Jumanji: The Next Level is dumb popcorn fun with good acting and chemistry from the video game characters but its predictability, repetitveness, and lack of tension takes away from the film.",Jumanji - The Next Level

207,domtaylor,Pure fun.,7,10 December 2019,"'Jumanji: The Next Level' is the second, third, or fourth film (depending on if you're counting 'Jumanji' (1995) and or 'Zathura: A space Adventure (2005)) in the surprisingly successful franchise that's somehow managed to rival Star Wars and Marvel in terms of popularity and box-office success. It's the same as its immediate predecessor in two ways: firstly, the narratives are pretty much identical and, secondly, they're both fast-moving, fantastically entertaining and ferociously fun. Seriously, it's incredible that the last one worked, but the fact that this one is just as good is somehow even more surprising. While the MacGuffin driven plot is pretty generic, and the villain is extremely basic and unmemorable, it sort of gets away with it given its 'video-game nature' and, more importantly, the strength of its characters. It would be easy to dismiss the writing here and claim that its success comes from its spectacle, but that's just simply not the case. The film works because the characters are so well written and performed. They all have great chemistry, which creates the majority of the fun. This time around, the body-swapping concept is dialled-up a bit, too, which stops it from feeling like it's retreading old ground and allows the excellent actors to experiment even more. It's hard to believe that the 'real-world' actors barely have any scenes at all, which highlights how much the concept works. The big stars completely disappear and fully manage to channel their 'real life' counterparts; this just shows how good their performances are. The movie isn't deep, but it's not trying to be and sometimes that's great. It sets out to entertain its audience for two hours and it achieves that with ease. It's an effortlessly fun flick with a winning formula. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing where this series goes in its third outing (or is it the fourth? No, wait... the fifth?). 7/10",Jumanji - The Next Level

211,maxmages,"A warm infusion from the first part, just in stupid + boring",3,31 May 2020,"Whereas the first film was still a real adventure film, this is just a cheap string of scenes, pictures, film sets and badly rimmed effects.Before that, the video games and their clichés were put on the back burner, which was completely ignored in this part and I don't understand why.
Because there was enough in both film and video games (in the 90s) to criticize and to put in as a jokeOne-dimensional characters, villains whit exaggerated plans, badly rimmed graphics, animals moving in circles instead of having a real AI. Or the stereotypes of foreigners.But no puff cake, the whole film is so empty and not saying as if you had taken 20 steps back. Everyone in the film is super annoying and super unpleasant, so I kept shouting ""shut up"" every 3 minutes.
Everyone is telling the same jokes for almost an hour and a half, really, again and again.
And I can't decide until the end of the film who's going to poke me more Danny DeVito or The Rock. What is Grandpa Eddi because has he Alzheimer? Is he demented? Is he stupid? Do you just pretend? What is he?
At the end of the film they try to be really emotional and pseudo-philosophically too late.
Also in this film I had no impression that what was at stake nor that the characters were really in danger
but when Danny DeVito said growing old wasn't hell, I got the cold vomit.
Movies should finally stop lying. sometimes the glass is half full and sometimes half empty but you shouldn't lie about the liquid in it.But what I think is the worst thing is that the film made nothing of its premise. A lot of bad second parts have that they restore the status quo from part 1 and tell the same story again here it would have actually made sense and I also find it interesting that Spencer voluntarily goes to video games to be back in paradise but then it became Idea didn't finish and that's the worst.

The most thrilling scene is the one in which the characters try to cross a maze of rope bridges, where one wrong step can land them in the jaws of ferocious monkeys ready to devour them!The film fairly succeeds in recreating the magic from the previous film. However you feel something amiss as the film progresses. The comedy and thrilling aspects don't really give out the expected impact to the viewer along with the plot which could have been even more interesting!The cast members give a wonderful performance. Dwayne Johnson shines with his 'smoldering intensity', Kevin Hart and Jack Black tickle your funny bone, Karen Gillan bowls you over with her hot moves. Also we get to see Rory McCann ('The Hound' from GOT) in a 'brutal' role.All in all, this film has its fair share of fun & entertainment, although one would have expected something more out of it.

I though it wasn't going to be as good as Welcome To The Jungle and maybe flop. But thankfully I was wrong for the most part at least. The Next Level is a fun, adventurous sequel that throws in new elements to mix things up a bit. And it's emotional beats are there and are sometimes even better then the first. And that mostly due to the actors delivery. Speaking of the which the cast is pitch perfect again just like the first movie. When I was the Rock and Kevin Hart I couldn't help but think of them as Danny DeVito and Danny Glover because their delivery. The action and the effects are also just as good if not better then the first. I love how the villain was played by the Hound from GOT. Even though he was underdeveloped I still felt like he was more developed then the villain in the last movie. I also loved how Alex came back and helped them that was really wholesome. There are some scenes in this movie that feel Ike they drag on for a bit longer then they should and the pace isn't as tight as the first movie, but The Next Level still offers a fun movie with humor and heart.

The reasoning for why they all went back into the Junanji world seemed a bit far fetched and meant the movie was off to a shaky start.This continued when they changed up the formula too much in my opinion making both the Rock and Kevin Hart being played by the older men. This annoyed me more than it made me laugh, almost to the point of giving up on the movie.However I persevered, and it improved throughout. The changes in character did provide some good laughs later on during the Jumanji fruit tree scene. The characters in Jumanji did well at changing their accents and mannerisms to fit their player. Jack Black especially changing from Fridge to Bethany was the best I think.The villains and fight scenes were less interesting than the first movie. Despite this it did have some good scenes and the introduction of the pick pocket character played by Awkafina was a good choice I think.Overall a good movie but not as good as the first one.",Jumanji - The Next Level

It's the same exact plot as the original film and they didn't even try to hide it. The usage of the ""old men in younger bodies"" was overplayed in my opinion and most of it was too over the top and I didn't find it funny. In general I barely laughed at all during this film, maybe a few light chuckles. I truly hope they don't make a 3rd based off the post credits scene of the animals coming out of the game.

All four of the main leads returned and you can see they got to have fun with these new characters, other than Karen Gillan who still played Martha. I will say that I'm not the biggest Kevin Hart, who plays Milo, fan but in this movie, I can see why people like him. He fully embodied playing this seventy-five-year-old man and it made for some humorous scenes. Jack Black, who plays Bethany/Fridge, was a standout in the previous movie and still was a standout in this one. Dwayne ""the rock"" Johnson, who plays Eddie, also did a fantastic job playing an elderly man but I will say that at times he slipped back into his normal voice. I'm not sure if this is just me, but it defiantly worked for the annoying kid sitting next to me, but the comedy didn't really make me laugh that much. There were some points where I chuckled but nothing that made me laugh out loud. Again, this is probably just a me thing but it's just worth mentioning that I found the humour worked best in the previous movie than in this one. The CGI was all right in this movie but nothing really made me go wow. Really my main issue with this movie is how they made it more complicated then it needed to be. The previous one was straight forward and you understood what needed to be done but this movie just throws in some random stuff that it just doesn't need.

There was also a really charming, sentimental twist at the end of the story that was more or less the cherry on top of the sundae.It was impossible for the sequel to duplicate the twist, but darned if it didn't take the basic joke, twist it, elaborate on it, and spin it around and around in ways i found consistently surprising and funny.

233,TheCasualReviewer,"Kevin Hart as Danny Glover? Yes, please!",5,15 December 2019,"I was really looking forward to this one. The trailers were on point and the first film was such a nice surprise, so I had high expectations for Jumanji: The Next Level.
SYNOPSIS:
It's been a couple years since Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Martha (Morgan Turner) and Bethany (Madison Iseman) succeeded in their quest through Jumanji. Spencer, going through a tough time with school and his relationship with the crew, causes him to explore the realms of Jumanji again and the crew now has to go back in to save him.DIRECTION:
The same exact direction as you saw in the first film. I have no problem here and the direction does still allow this film to hold my attention until some point through the third act at which point I was checking out.WRITING:
The majority of the problems I have with this film are right here in the script. It's already a tough task to make essentially the same film while still adding enough to not feel entirely similar. After seeing the trailer, I was excited to see The Rock playing Danny DeVito and Kevin Hart playing Danny Glover, but one of the big problems to me was the dialogue for both of them. The film constantly plays with the fact that Glover and DeVito don't realize they're in a video game. It was funny for the first act and then a little into the second act, but I was sitting there wondering ""when are they going to stop acting like they still don't remember they're in a video game."" I understand if this were to be a real situation that it would be hard to believe, but they didn't play it like it was hard to believe, but that they didn't understand and then they understood and then they didn't understand and then they understood (no, I didn't accidentally repeat that twice, that's just how they were portrayed in the film). Maybe I'm nit-picking, but at some point I want the writing to make a decision on whether they want the characters to understand or not. Another issue I had was a similar issue I had with the first film. An underused villain. I get that adventure is the big picture of the film, but when you barely build up a villain, I feel no real threat when the crew and the villain meet face-to-face. Lastly, I won't give it away, but there was a decision made in the writing at the end of the film that I borderline despised. I know that's not true criticism, but I spent my whole drive home and a couple hours into this Chicago Bulls game trying to think of a way to explain it without spoiling it. So, if you really want to know then DM on here (if that's even a thing) or on my IG @YourGuyJYACTING:
I'll start with saying that The Rock wasn't great as Danny DeVito. I would say sub-par, however, he's charming enough on screen where I started to not notice as much. I think Jack Black and Karen Gillan were great just like from the first film. Now onto the bread and butter and that is Kevin Hart and Awkwafina. Kevin Hart is so good at playing Danny Glover that I almost wish he stayed playing Danny Glover in every role he's in. To me he really saved this film and kept it fresh enough to keep me entertained. Then in comes Awkwafina hot off her performance in The Farewell into a much more exciting role. I loved her in Crazy Rich Asians and I liked her in The Farewell (even though I wasn't a fan of the film) and I loved her in this. ESPECIALLY, when there's a certain switch to her character. She KILLED it from that point and I really can't wait to see what she does next.CONCLUSION:
This film was good enough from start to finish that I wouldn't say it's not for anyone. I feel this film will be less enjoyable to adults than it will be for kids (which this film is more catered towards) as it does feel very repetitive throughout the film. It was also good enough where I would recommend you do see it, just when it comes out on DVD so you can see Kevin Hart's and Awkwafina's performances.",Jumanji - The Next Level

236,WooderIce64,"Familiar, but Entertaining",7,18 February 2020,"After the success of the sleeper hit Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, it was only a matter of time before a sequel got made. Jumanji: The Next Level is pretty much Welcome to the Jungle all over again. It's a fun movie, it's cleverly written, and that's about it. It covers many of the same beats, but it's still funny because the premise is something that can be used for a whole new set of different jokes and gags. Spencer goes back to Jumanji, and the others need to get him back. Only this time, Spencer's grandfather (Danny DeVito) and his business partner (Danny Glover) get sucked in too. At the beginning, Danny DeVito is in the Rock's body, Danny Glover in Kevin Hart, Fridge in Jack Black, and Martha returns to Karen Gillan.The main source of humor is people adjusting to being in different bodies and having different abilities, and it is based on the idea of people ending up in the bodies of people drastically contrast with who they are as people. The reason it works is that the audience is somehow able to see Danny DeVito as the Rock, rather than the just Rock acting like an old guy. It's a difficult thing to pull off, and it does so successfully. While the idea of the old guys adjusting is funny at first, it does get old after a while. It funny enough on its own to make it a good time. Much like the previous movie, it carries a strong sense of adventure. It does end on a sequel hook, so Jumanji 4 is inevitable at this point. Based on this and WTTJ, we can imagine it's going to be a fun, entertaining, and enjoyable.",Jumanji - The Next Level

It's exactly what I hoped they'd add on because that's the kind of thing the first movie did, it tried to work with the stereotypes and elements found in those good old adventure games like Tomb Raider.I also liked that they brought back the WHOLE gang, the reason why movies like this where the most logical thing would be to make it anthologic, that is, with different kids experiencing the game; so when they try to use the same characters that supposedly learned something from their past experience in it, is a recipe for disaster because it's hard to bring all the gang together without it being forced. But i liked the way they did it, it felt controlled and fulfilling in the end.In conclusion, it was a funny, entertaining and creative action adventure movie, it's not gonna win any Oscars but it's so wrll thought of that it's a delight to watch and I feel it never grows old, you can rewatch it and enjoy it all over again",Jumanji - The Next Level
239,eparazak,"Flawed yet exciting, Jumanji: The Next Level delivers what you'd expect from it.",7,16 December 2019,"Jumanji: The Next Level was brought to us by the same director and cast members from the previous film alongside a few newcomers. This is a direct sequel to Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle that takes place after the group from the previous film's first college semester. When one of them disappears into Jumanji for unknown reasons, it's up to the rest of the group as well as a few newcomers to find them and finish the game.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle made a ton of money at the box office when it came out, so a sequel was inevitably gonna come. Fortunately, it really delivers, but not quite on every front.At the movie's core, it's an action-adventure film that, just like its predecessor, combined video game tropes with it. It has scripted scenes, NPCs that can only say certain things as well as high-flying action. It's still self-aware and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's very funny and witty, as well as action-packed, which is what I was expecting. I don't go into Jumanji expecting some epic, serious adventure; just a fun, action-adventure experience, and I got that.There were some elements in this movie that really stood out for me for both the right and wrong reasons. One element that worked is that one of the main characters' struggles with returning to the group after college because he doesn't see his life as interesting. This was something I could relate to on a personal level, and I feel like many others could too. It works in the film's favor because it also gives him a satisfying character arc that pays off in the end.One element that didn't work was the addition of the new characters. There are two new characters that are added into the film portrayed by Danny Glover and Danny Devito, and while Glover's character is fine, I had a hard time liking Devito's. Don't get me wrong, when we meet him and he still is played by Devito, he can be pretty funny. When we see him in the Jumanji game as Dwayne Johnson, however, he can be pretty unbearable at times. He also has a grudge on Danny Glover's character and the reasoning for it didn't really justify his actions for me.With that being said, there are some areas where the movie rehashes elements from the second film. For example, the characters sometimes get themselves killed through stupid means. There is a person that goes missing in the game. Those are just a few examples of rehashed elements. They didn't hinder my enjoyment of the film, aside from during a few instances, but I thought they were too noticeable to not mention.Either way, despite my complaints, I had a very fun time with this movie. Fans of Welcome to the Jungle will most likely enjoy it. There isn't a dull moment in this film, and I found it fun despite its flaws. Pretty good movie!7/10",Jumanji - The Next Level

Dwayne Johnson is on again, off again with his Danny Davito accent but nails the character. Jack Black shines again in both roles. I wish we'd have had more of Aquafina and Nick Jonas.A lot of the rules of the game this time round make less sense than the first movie but it doesn't matter because it's still a lot of fun.Don't forget to watch for the extra scene in the credits!

I actually liked it quite a bit, this one I don't like at all.Let me start off by saying first that the inconsistencies in the storytelling are present, and all over the place and so is the story. I cannot believe that they even decided to make a sequel to the other movie so quickly. That's always a bad sign, for me personally.They switch bodies 3 times and man does it confuse the crap out of you. The scenery changes are abrupt and startling in how fake they look and how the storyline doesn't flow with them at all. They took the bare minimum of a story and made it into a film that is a little over 2 hours long.Everybody's original Avatars are different from the get go, and just because the main character from the first movie, Spencer, had a few bumps in the road in college, he decided that it was time to go back to Jumanji and the gangs all split up, until they reluctantly decide to find out where Spencer is, only to find that he's in Jumanji.Danny Devito and Danny Glover are in this and end up playing both The Rock and Kevin Hart, who both go in and out with their accents and it's as great as Cameron Diaz' and Leonardo DiCaprio's ""Irish"" accent in Gangs of New York.The rest of the movie flubbs and tries to come up with an interesting storyline, but it untimatley fails with the bad storytelling and even worse script.I'm begging you Dwane, Please no more.",Jumanji - The Next Level

The Rock and Kevin Hart work together quite well. Unfortunately, here they don't get to play off of each other as much as I'd like, but they still give some gems. Do not get me wrong, my viewing neighbor and I were cracking up throughout the movie, but at times the jokes got old. Honestly, just thinking about Kevin Hart doing an impression of Danny Glover and Dwayne doing his impression of Danny DeVito's character was quite hilarious; however, by the end of the movie the old people jokes have worn out their welcome.The movie just felt too long - partly because they overused the same jokes.*loses a life* There were a few lulls throughout the movie, but in the times of action or comedy the movie does a good job of keeping you entertained. And, the direction of the action is good enough to make the audience feel as if they are really in a video game, which makes up for some of the lulls in the movie.Final level of this review, Jumanji: The Next Level is a fun family friendly movie. There are laughs for the old folks and the young. If you liked the Jumanji from 2017 you will like this one. I would suggest during this holiday season that you take the kids to a matinee and allow yourself to get sucked into the game.Call it by its name..... JUMANJIIIIIIIIII!",Jumanji - The Next Level
245,helenbassett,"Jumanji: The Next Level - Jake Kasdan Directs A Hugely Entertaining Sequel With Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Danny de Vito, Nick Jonas & Awkwafina",10,3 January 2020,"I was really looking forward to see how the new Jumani cast would work with the original cast members, and it was a total blast. Director Jake Kasdan seamlessly wove Danny de Vito, Awkwafina and Danny Glover into Jumanji: The Next Level, each bringing their own skills to the gaming world.Our original four high school kids are now Freshmen at College, and some handling it better than others. Alex Wolff's Spencer is still the nerd of The Breakfast Club crew, and coming home for Christmas he gets to share his bedroom with Grandpa, played by Danny de Vito, and convalescing after a hip operation. Fun! And Spencer is in no rush to meet up with his pals from detention. He just misses being Dr Bravestone. Do we blame him? Of course not, who wouldn't miss being Dwayne Johnson. Have you seen him? But the kids broke the game up at the end of the last Jumanji.And when Spencer doesn't arrive his pals come to find him. Ser'Darius Blain again plays Fridge the athlete, Madison Iseman's Bethany is still loving her phone and Morgan Turner's Martha is still loving Spencer, but they never seem to connect anymore. In real life anyway. And when they turn up at Spencer's house they also meet Grandpa Eddie and his friend Milo played by Danny Glover. The old timers have some unfinished business from a long time ago. But the kids are more interested in finding Spencer. And guess where he is.But with a broken game the characters aren't playing correctly, and we have extra unexpected avatars. Who are more than a little surprised themselves. This could take some getting used to! As a sequel the film more than lives up to its predecessor, with Danny de Vito and Awkwafina excelling as Dr Bravestone and Ming Fleetfoot. Although not always in the right order. The avatars we met in the first movie including Karen Gillan's Ruby Roundhouse, she's still awesome, terrific Kevin Hart's Mouse Finbar and Jack Black's Shelly Oberon are back again for the desert adventure. Casting for both films was incredible. They all work so well together. And Bethany has a whole new sleek body to discover. As well as no phone. Again. But Nick Jonas's Jefferson Seaplane is still in one piece. Thankfully.And of course Jumanji is again in great danger, this time from the marauding Jurgen the Brutal, played by Rory McCann. And with new skills and weaknesses our players must do what they do best to save Spencer and Jumanji. And it's terrifically funny. I cannot say I'm a fan of gaming but Jumanji is one hell of a ride, with the new wilder levels and fiercer CGI animals. Some of whom even escape out of the broken cartridge box. But that's a whole other level.With vivid cinematography by Gyula Pados, new desert vistas and snow covered mountain peaks to climb, the prospect of death always hangs over our avatars, with their three lives and counting. And we get through them pretty rapidly just explaining the game. But lives in Jumanji live on, so fly, fly, and maybe see you next time.",Jumanji - The Next Level
246,Mccadoo,Falls just a tad short of the original but still fun,8,30 March 2020,"Don't get me wrong, this was a very good movie and a lot of fun. But I don't think it's as fun, or fresh as the original. I think most of the reason for that is the inclusion of the older characters played by Danny Devito and Danny Glover. They were funny at first but their shtick grew old very quickly and caused the middle of the movie to drag terribly. At one point we actually considered bailing on it.I'm glad we didn't though. Once the original characters returned to their original game characters the movie got right back on track and had a great ending. So if you're a fan of the first movie (actually the second if you're counting the Robin Williams entry) i would still highly recommend this one. Just be prepared for the movie dragging through it's middle with the old guy gags carrying on for far too long. But it's worth bearing up through that for a very funny third act and a great ending.On a side note; it appears that in preparation for her return to playing Ruby Roundhouse, Killer of Men; Karen Gillan did some serious crunches. She was sporting some serious abs in this movie! Kevin Hart also looked liked he'd been spending time in the gym recently. The Rock looked....like The Rock, and Jack Black looked like he always does...",Jumanji - The Next Level

I have tried to watch most his films but have never made it to the end of one.
I'm not blaming Kevin alone for this rubbish, just everyone involved, especially the joke writers.
Granted. There were a bunch of teen girls behind me who laughed out loud at everything which just annoyed me more cos i couldn't even muster a single smile. In fact. I fell asleep watching it or else i would've left sooner.
1 is the lowest rating i can give it or else it would've been minus 9.

A def watch for a laugh & goofy action. Not to mention Matilda and Lethal weapon actors! C'mon they were brill! talk about a lil nostalgia in a good way....

While going through a break, Spencer, decides it's time for another adventure, but does so without backup. Now we travel from a low desert to a high mountain in the hopes of saving Jumanji and calling out its name.Overall, I laughed hard throughout the film, and though things seemed expected at times, it was still a great adventure.

I couldn't believe how large a crowd it was attracting even after several weeks had passed. Looking at it now, it makes a little more sense. There is a little something for pretty much every audience member in this film while remaining kid friendly. That means a lot of families went to see it alongside movie goers in general.

253,hiraishinnojutsu,Even worse than before,5,4 December 2019,"Jeez I don't even know why I wasted my penny to even bother trying to enjoy this boring of a sequel knowing the fact that the previous film was already a disappointment. ""The Next Level"" in the title actually describes the next level of unnecessary scenes and unfunny, mediocre jokes that add no meaning or weight to the overall plot of the story. The action scene is dull, the CGI is bad, the tension is absent, the pace is too slow, the drama is too shallow, and our heroes' (and heroine's) journey from the beginning until the very end of the third act falls flat. In summary, this is the worst installment of the entire franchise, so far. No offense, even I still gave the flopped, forced-wokeness Terminator: Dark Fate a 7 out of 10 rating.",Jumanji - The Next Level

But as always I checked it out myself with my family.It was wonderful and amazing. I'd even say it was better then the first. Even though some of the ""awe"" is gone from the first, they did many of things to bring some new awe. Alot of twists too. If you seen the trailers, there is alot they aren't showing you that you will not expect.The cast did a great job with their spot on imperinations of who they were supposed to be. The comedy was great and there was never really any flopped jokes. Though if you haven't seen the first, you may not get many of the jokes. And for gamers there are things they do that make you say ""Yep, thats a video game for you!"".I have no real complaints. I'd only say if you have little kids, there are some animals that may be scary to them. In one scene a man is feeding some hyenas small pieces of meat. At which point he says the meat is the hyenas trainer. Not even sure a kid will understand that, but for some it may scare them but seeing a piece of meat and thinking it was really a person at one time.",Jumanji - The Next Level

The actors were great and I loved the addition of some others, more specifically Danny Devito. Although I was disappointed to not see Jack Black playing ""Bethany"" as much just because that is my all time favorite part of the movie, but he was still hilarious regardless. I also loved the addition of Awkwafina who nails it when it comes to playing the Grandpa's avatar in the game. Yet another great part of the whole movie!

Spencer has some insecurities and is feeling blue, he and his girlfriend or on a break, which causes him to return to the game. This time, they've added a couple of new guests, which formulates an even better team that makes this movie even more humorous.
The environment turns out to be different in the game along with the storyline, and also makes this film more interesting.
If your a Dwayne Johnson or Kevin Hart fans, you're in for a treat watching this film, you'll be introduced, to the two new Dannys.

I was pleasantly surprised at last one and proudly boasted in my review....now, I must give less credit when it's due. This version was over-rated and lost the magic previously developed. It could be bringing 2 unnecessary big name actors (DeVito and Glover)? I don't believe they brought anything worthwhile to this sequel. Their parts could have been similarly performed by any other actors and maybe brought the same level of entertainment.Just so glad that I saw this at a matinee where the previous movie, I saw in 3D which I never do.

262,rustonreviews,Another fun voyage within the world of Jumanji.,6,23 December 2019,"When Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) was released, I made the conscientious choice to take a miss. In my eyes, the original Jumanji (1995) is an untouchable classic, with no reboot or sequel necessary. Recently this year, however, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and found myself pleasantly surprised. While incomparable to the original, it was a perfectly fun film in its own right with a likable cast and enough enjoyable set pieces to keep the adventure moving. With Jumanji: The Next Level, the adventure continues with Johnson, Gillan, Black and Hart reprising their roles once again. Three years have passed since the events that transpired in Welcome to the Jungle, and Spencer (Alex Wolff) misses the world of Jumanji as he grows ever more dissatisfied with his own reality. After he returns to the world of the game, his friends seek out to rescue him in order to confront him as to why he felt the need to return. Much to their surprise, the rules of Jumanji have changed due to faults with the system, resulting in some hilarious body swap blunders along the way.Along with the four primary cast members (including new additions Danny DeVito & Danny Glover), Jake Kasdan also returns as director and, this time, co-writer. While there isn't a whole lot of difference between Welcome to the Jungle and The Next Level, I wouldn't exactly call that a bad thing. Just like its predecessor, this third chapter in the Jumanji-verse is another fun voyage with plenty of exciting set pieces, witty humour and just enough heart to ensure the whole affair doesn't ring hollow. The ensemble cast (accompanied this time by Awkwafina) remain a great fit and maintain their strong chemistry shared from their preceding outing, as do their younger counterparts who we begin and end the film with. The films antagonist, Jurgen the Brutal (Rory McCann), is, while serviceable enough, the films weakest element. While it doesn't stand out as one of this years most memorable films, Jumanji: The Next Level is still perfectly enjoyable escapism that is worth a watch if you enjoyed 2017's reboot/sequel.",Jumanji - The Next Level

265,kokomo123,Could easily be better,7,5 March 2020,What I liked in the first film and in the first half of this one is the feeling of being inside the game.

But by the end this film became typical action with no twist and with bad guys losing for no reason and pretty dull.,Jumanji - The Next Level

So Jumanji : the next level is directed by Joe kaplan and stars everyone from the first one along with Danny devito as Spencer's grandpa. So Spencer for some reason goes back into the game and the gang go back in as well , to save him ofc. Only this time , Spencer's grandpa and his friend also get stuck . Unlike last time they don't get to choose their avatars and so fridge becomes Jack black , Devito's friend becomes Kevin Hart and Devito himself becomes the Rock ! , All these actors trying to imitate another one , especially Jack Black as Fridge was hilarious and made place for a lot of running gags and one liners which landed.in the end , Jumanji the next level is fun , adrenaline fueled and has the best cue and montage for "" welcome to the jungle "" by gun's and roses.",Jumanji - The Next Level

""",7,5 March 2020,"When you hear this word 'Jumanji' the nostalgia strikes right on your mind because your 90s childhood will be incomplete if you haven't watched it's first part. Fun sequel overall but despite a shorter adventure feel (switchblade was like one encounter) and predictable twists.Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillian's chemistry is a treat to watch and both are very effective in the action scenes. Awkwafina is new to the cast and has done a good job. Nick Jonas appears late but leaves a mark. Rhys Darby, Rory McCann and the others get little scope but do a fine job.Overall Jumanji The Next Level is a great follow up to Welcome to the Jungle! It doesn't stand above the first from 2017, not better not worse. If you didn't like the first, highly doubt you'll enjoy this one any more. But it's still funny for those entertained by the first.Overall, it is a good fun movie to watch with your family.",Jumanji - The Next Level
269,Lost_In_Translation_,Mediocre Popcorn Movie To The MAX,6,5 January 2020,"I'm not opposed to seeing a dumb popcorn flick every now and again. The Fast and Furious movies are essentially that and I enjoyed those for the most part. I do look forward to being surprised when something I think is going to be a dumb popcorn movie ends up being something more special like Bumblebee or Edge of Tomorrow.This sequel sits on the low end of that spectrum and is a serviceable enjoyable mediocre popcorn flick. The first was a much better example of a turn-off-your-brain fun movie. Nothing deep or memorable, but you'll be entertained for 2 hours. This is literally more of the same with a few players switched around.The worst part of it is the decision to have two elderly characters sucked into the game. Their whole joke in the movie was that they don't understand what is going on. So we are essentially given the exposition explanation for how the world works ALL OVER AGAIN because of these two senior characters. It's not just once, it's their whole joke of the movie. The whole ""old people don't understand stuff"" is their joke for 3/4ths of the movie and it gets old.The Rock for half this movie gives a superbly awful performance feigning a New Jersey accent as he is supposed to be Danny DeVito's character internally. This was a terrible choice as the Rock is just serviceable actor when given the right material, but he does not do accents well at all. Kevin Hart on the other hand does a fantastic impersonation of Danny Glover, though the whole joke of the movie for him is the talks slow. Thankfully there's a body swap towards the last act so The Rock is back to the normal kid. Awkwafina then becomes DeVito and one-thousand percent does a better New Jersey accent. She's honestly the best part of the movie hands down, but doesn't join until halfway in the movie.Besides that terrible Rock performance, the rest of the movie is essentially just a copy of the first movie with a few little things done differently. It's a serviceable way to kill 2 hours and it has a few laughs, but it doesn't do much different than the first did.It's good the ending here alludes to them completely changing the formula in the 4th movie, but this one should have been the one to make major changes.Again it's not terrible, but it's literally just a copy/paste of the first movie with some pieces moved around. It would have been neat to see them change the formula in this one and make it interesting. Maybe had a whole new cast of characters along with Awkwafina's character. But they chose to play it safe and just do similar tropes from the first one.Of all the holiday fare, it's honestly better than Star Wars: TRoS and Frozen 2, so go and see it and enjoy some dumb fun for 2 hours.",Jumanji - The Next Level

Not only because Glover and DeVito's story is touching and believable (in the very short time it's being told), but the actors (the game avatars) nailed channeling DeVito and Glover. Kevin Hart stole the show as Danny Glover's avatar, but the others were impressive too. The Rock and Awkwafina did an amazing job acting like DeVito.

1. Voice changes, this really almost ruined the movie for me, just as the avatar doesn't change for the character neither should their voice.
2. Addition of the grandpas who used most of the movie complaining about a restaurant it wasn't funny or necessary, and the forgetfulness got old quick.Danny Devito should have been used as an avator instead of wasting him on a grandpa cast. there could of been some hilarious scenes done with that.3. too much foolishness wasting their 3 lives, there never felt like danger from the enemy's.4. Introducing new player characters randomly, what is this a MMO game ? how would this be possible on the original board game.5. not as funny or serious as the first one-

The script isn't going to blow anyone away, so it needs to lean on its performances, action and comedic timing. All three are good, with the comedy being the highlight. When watching a light action flick like this you expect to enjoy yourself, which I did, but it was a welcome surprise to discover just how funny it got. Forget the plot: main characters mimicking main characters in different game 'skins' just doesn't get old.

I was curious how they'd get on with the body switching as the players become thier avatars, as they've already done it all in the last film, but it worked really well as only Martha/Ruby was the same as in the original and we got the fun of the others being in different bodies - and DeVito and Glover being sucked into the game added funny complications.How everyone had added skills or weaknesses really worked well, and kept to the original idea that Jumanji is a computer game and additions like that are common in game sequels.
As are the addition of new characters - specifically Ming and the pegasusRhys Darby was as great in his role as before!Overall a brilliant film and one I highly recommend",Jumanji - The Next Level

287,Hammer-Rocks,Just As Good as The Last Jumanji,8,6 April 2020,"Usually sequels tend to be inferior to their predecessor, but this movie bucked that trend, and in my opinion, it is just as good.The storyline while remaining faithful to the first (Jumanji, remake), brought in enough new dynamics to the story that it kept it fresh and entertaining. It was not a case of ""I've seen that before"". They've put less emphasis on what we already know - from the previous movie - and focussed more on the new storyline.Once again the actors did a great job changing the personalities of their characters (ie. avatars) to reflect their supposedly personalities in the real world. All top notch actors.While the violence is stylised, it might be a tad brutal for the really young ones. But overall, if you want action, adventure, drama and laughter, this movie has it all. A worthy sequel and a worthwhile watch. You will be entertained.Tip: This movie will make more sense if you watch the previous Jumanji (remake) before hand.",Jumanji - The Next Level

Me because I was hoping for it to be good since the last Jumanji that came out in 2017 witch I thought was a pretty solid comedy and remake this movie did have some funny scenes like jack black in all of them he was my favourite part of the movie to be honest Kevin Hart was funny too but The Rocks Danny DeVito impression got old after a few minutes and it was starting to annoy me same thing when they switched and that girl was Danny DeVito also same as last time the villain was stupid but to be fare this is better then most reboots that come out it was probably a 7 in the first half but that just dropped during the
second half of the movie it just got boring but the action scenes were r

289,ZuhayrRoha,Only a fun good comedy to pass time,6,21 June 2020,"What made 'Jumanji:Welcome to the Jungle' special for me was that it didn't try to copy/build upon the orginal 1995. But 'The Next Level' did those things so by comparison it feels underwhelming.First of all, nice name. This movie did crank up the notch for characters & locations. Danny DaVito & Glover were nice additions and brought something new to the table with some greats comedy by Rock. Kevin tried something different at last and his comedy gets much better when Fridge takes over.I loved the small scenes of old guys taking about friendship, restaurant and retirement and it suits better with Milo staying over. The starting was much better than 2017's one, carried the story forward of Spencer feeling insecure about his body and going back to the game to find his better version.All 4 main cast shines but they shined better in 2017. The mythology expands with idea of 'crossing body' but felt a bit forced as to get them back to their original avaters. The movie expands in location and some great adventures were shown. 3 lives-gameover tension was done better in the first one. Awkwafina and Nick Jones didn't add that much.Some comedy were great but most didn't land for me.
Loved the post-credit scene and exited to where they will take the story. Hope this one takes place in earth just like the classic one with Robin Williams",Jumanji - The Next Level

Don't get me wrong this movie is still a lot fun and is enjoyable but the movie at times gets very repetitive and the story at times is very much all over the place. This movie does have some of the same magic the first movie did with the cast once again doing an amazing job and the jokes delivering some laugh out loud moments but there is also some kick butt action scenes.

Bland, generic villains, no opportunity for some really clever video game jokes, and nothing to prove warranting further movies. As amazing as it is, it's slightly better than Welcome to the Jungle, but that's only because of the antics of Danny Glover and Danny DeVito. Kevin Hart is funnier impersonating Glover and Dwayne Johnson is fun as DeVito. The movies lack the heart and soul of the original, and Sony can't make good movies anymore. Making a wacky video game movie is perfectly fine with me, but I don't know why they're doing it with Jumanji. The original is a fun action, adventure fantasy with great practical effects. It has some laughs, but it's no comedy by any stretch of the imagination. I miss the primordial jungle with giant spiders and man eating plants. They really need to get back to their roots. There are some fun video game moments, but there's not enough of them, and the ones we do get aren't strong enough to be clever or entertaining. If you've seen the trailer for Free Guy, that's a movie that's getting the video game stuff right. Wreck-It Ralph is also more entertaining for it's antics.

When Spencer doesn't show for a catch up, his friends go to his house looking for him and make the conclusion he has gone back into Jumanji. The friends go into the game but with two new characters, Spencers grandpa Eddie (Danny DeVito) and Milo (Danny Glover).I found Milo in the game to be annoying fast with how slow he spoke. I get he's an old man, but the novelty wore off quick and became less funny every time he spoke. Something I wanted to see more of was Beth's character in Jack Black's body.

I can see it as an entertaining movie for children, but certainly not one for the whole family. It never should have been made into a franchise.

310,kmjnhh123,"Feels Like Half Of A Film, Lives Dont Matter",5,31 December 2019,"So i've seen the first film & absolute loved the first film so was looking forward to this one but was disappointed to say the least.Lets start by talking about the character switch for the first half of the film which was not a good idea personally, i was hoping for the original cast to be in the role for the entire film but that was not the case, the reason i didn't like that was because it like a repeat of the first film where they had no idea what was going on & they had no idea about their abilities they were capable of which does have a few funny moments but gets boring quite quick because you know what they can do but there so clueless it made me feel kinda frustrated at points to where i was saying in my head, hurry up & get along with the film we've seen this all before, honestly i think it was a easy filler for the first half of the film.Because of them things they go through their game lives really fast which have absolutely no meaning because then they have 1 life for the rest of the film & you 100% know they are not going to die so the lives thing is pointless & after all the cast have got 1 life they stop talking about the lives & move on to something else in the film, whereas in the first film they actually care about the lives they have & be careful, not just wasting them all in this film.Also there is some really pointless segments in the film, one pointless segment was the bridge area with the monkeys, know my friends pointed out that it was a level within the game but then i said what level, all they did was walk up to it & decide to jump over some random bridges, there was no artefact or statue to get from doing the bridges, in fact they could of just walked straight past the bridges because they end up exactly where they started, at the beginning of the bridges so why did they have to even attempt it, again it just felt like pointless filler to me because it served no purpose.So after all that at the beginning of the film the cast finally switch back to their original roles & the film can finally start, its similar business to the original when things switch but it still does not have that vibe the first film had. The protagonist wasn't even that scary or worth much in general, all he does is walk round talking, takes a few punches at the end & then dies to the Jumanji fruit, great........Overall this was a big let down, have a read of my review after reading the good reviews & you will think twice on what you have just watched.Age - 25

Feel that the main characters do not know what to do, as if collective health wisdom scene, this kind of deliberately sell silly laugh really can not add. First half of the story is really let a person speechless, compared to the first big action is also a lot less, less bone, but the quality of the literature has dropped a lot, who looks really embarrassed, but also forced touchy-feely, want to deliberately create a warm atmosphere, but just let a person feel very embarrassed, the movie fan really, plot puzzling, character is also puzzling, games and now this element in the first film has let a person feel novelty, in the second part the point is not so surprising, so should have more exciting plot, but also than but also the first plot, finish see really disappointed, see the eggs and possibly the third department, I hope the third part of the story can be a snack, for the sake of comedy and comedy is really boring.",Jumanji - The Next Level

However, I don't think it's enough to base a movie around especially when it seems the movie is very very similar to the first film.The film has its fun moments, but there's ultimately nothing that special.

And that's what I'm here to do, especially since I very much disliked the previous film (although much of why lies outside the film itself), but Jumanji: The Next Level was a good time.Taking place a year after the events of Welcome to the Jungle, our four protagonists - Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Martha (Morgan Turner) and Bethany (Madison Iseman) - have moved on but kept in touch. But Spencer's been having the hardest time after taking a break in his relationship with Martha. Returning home from college, he digs out the Jumanji game that he had fixed up (going off the alternate ending for WTTJ) and reenters the video game world.Worried for him, Spencer's friends come over and encounter Eddie (Danny DeVito), Spencer's grandfather, and Milo (Danny Glover), Eddie's estranged friend and business partner, and come to the realization that Spencer has gone back to Jumanji. The team return to the game, but this time along with Eddie and Milo. Martha retains her badass action girl Ruby Roundhouse avatar (Karen Gillan) but Fridge, instead of zoologist Mouse Finbar (Kevin Hart), gets stuck inside cartographer Shelly Oberon (Jack Black). Eddie has adopted the form of adventurer Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), and Milo in Finbar.There's new and old faces, the difficulty has intensified and the stakes higher. The Next Level seems to have been given an upgrade in terms of script, humor and performances, making for a much more entertaining sequel that improves upon its predecessor.

It means, all you have to do is living the present and look it with different perspectives.From the plot of the story, it kinds of light and predictable, but hey, it is a decent sequel you can enjoy with your family.

They didn't try to mess with the original and they did their own take on the film; a simple, family-friendly, easy-fun one. That said, Jumanji 3 is pretty mediocre and makes me conclude that it was unfortunately a mere result of the huge box office of Jumanji 2. Three things to sum up:1) They ruined any suspense I could have during the movie, because while watching it I realized they had - chronologically - put all the main scenes in the trailer. So, the whole time I knew what was coming up. Awful! (That said, I think the plot was pretty predictable anyways).2) they tried to make a funny movie for all ages, so half the time that a ""funny"" scene was coming up, I was just sitting there, feeling like I'm watching cheap stuff. The only thing that saved it was some likeable actors.and 3) regarding the acting, Awkwafina was not suitable for the part and I'm sorry for the meanness, but Nick Jonas was forgettable and Karen Gillan was replaceable - I don't understand what Gillan brings to the table and gets hired in such films, other than she can look sexy with good make-up.Overall, I kind of enjoyed my time in the theater, but the film is very forgettable. You get out of the cinema and you're like ""Hm, yeah, it was cute, I guess"".",Jumanji - The Next Level

But Welcome to the Jungle and The Next Level have been hits. The story, the acting and the action has been fantastic. The Rock really should be up for an Oscar for his role in playing a senior Danny Devito. My only bug bear about this movie - was the lack of animals in it. No Lions, tigers, elephants or anything from the previous movies. Just a snake, Monkeys, ostrich and some camels. The Robin Williams version made it sound this place was the scariest place alive.

However, there is an added level of unpredictability to the game, so even if you know they will eventually win the game, you can never know what will happen. Furthermore, the characters lose their lives earlier in the film, raising the stakes. The villain is also more menacing and a scene stealer too.

That being said, Danny Devito made this movie good and watchable. Liked it, not much of a plot, but some funny moments and I wasn't really expecting much, so it was good enough for me. Really enjoyed Karen Gillan and Awkwafina's performance was just wonderful. The way she pulled off Spencer's weirdness and awkward body language as well as Grandpa Eddie was hilarious. Actually they were all believable in their respective body swaps. The only one strangely enough that I just couldn't see as believable was Martha being Ruby.

The worst was Dwayne Johnson and the Asian woman named Awkward or something else regrettable.

409,jrwollscheid,"Great family movie, but not much else",6,31 August 2020,"Your typical Christmas family movie. The movie knows what it it is and is difficult to watch if you come in with high expectations. The writing is subpar and many jokes don't have the punch they think they have, but there are a few moments that are quite hilarious. The acting teens leaves much to be desired but the Rock, Jack Black, Danny Devito, Danny Glover and Kevin Hart steak the show with the best comedy. This movie is fun but tries too hard to push its message of friendship and growing older. The message does not seem to flow naturally. The scenery is brilliant and truly reminds me of playing a video game with its bright colors and ginormous animals and locations. I recommend going to a good theater as during the desert scenes it was so bright you could see through the screen and see the curtains behind them. It is a good movie to see with friends and have a good time at.",Jumanji - The Next Level
410,willsons-2,Wow! Brilliant movie.,10,26 December 2019,"I have just got home after seeing this movie and I have to say that it was perfect. And that is something that I rarely say.The story is great. It is extremely clever. There are multiple homages to the first of the ""reboot"" movies but without repeating anything from what came before. Visually it is stunning. Above all though it was hugely entertaining.But the best thing for me was the acting. The actors playing the avatars were wonderful. You were left in no doubt throughout the movie who were the ""people"" behind the avatars. Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black all put it wonderful performances (which is not to diminish any of the others). Dwayne Johnson is often harshly dealt with in reviews, but in this movie he shows that he can really act.To summarise: I am amazed just how well they pulled it off and at the same time made a better movie.Edit: I see there are a number of people who are down voting this hard and even suggesting that the high reviews are shills. Well I have edited this to tell those poor misguided souls that this is a genuine review. I could not disagree more with all of the negative 1/10 and 2/10 reviews. This is a great entertaining movie.

416,teacherianmitchell,Good fun for the family,7,31 July 2020,"The familiar cast return in a sequel that offers plenty of laughs and some memorable action sequences.Set several months after the events of the first reboot in the series, The Next Level finds a lamenting Spencer not enjoying college life in the Big Apple. As Martha, Bethany and Anthony look forward to reuniting for the holiday season, Spencer distracts himself by rebuilding the destroyed games console from the first instalment.It doesn't take long for the gang to realise that Spencer has returned to the world of Jumanji, but this time they have some surprising company in Spencer's Grandpa (Danny DeVito) and ex-business partner, Milo (Danny Glover).Dwayne Johnson and co do a stellar job with the new adventure, as do the new additions, and while there are plenty of laughs and impressive action sequences, one can't help but feel that the writing has missed a trick. The screenplay is just not quite as good - the pacing lags at times and there are portions of the movie that are pretty dialogue heavy - so not so great for the younger ones who would want to see this movie.That said, it's a fun watch. It's been made with love and you can tell, Karen Gillan continues to shine and the film builds to a satisfying climax. The extra comedic moments allowed by having two senior citizens (DeVito and Glover) also helps provide some real highlights and laugh-out-loud scenes.While not quite hitting the heights of its predecessor, this is still a great watch that will entertain the family for years to come.",Jumanji - The Next Level

421,VS132,"""For Those Who Seek To Find A Review.....Again""",8,28 December 2019,"Jumanji: The Next Level is a fun and entertaining film that is just as good as the surprising hit that was the first film. I felt like the writers just had a blast creating the story because they were able to enhance the personality of veterans and newcomers of the franchise through the reality and in the game itself especially with Spencer's grandfather and his friend who honestly had the best relationship in the film. Though there are some scenes and jokes that do drag on, most of the comedy and thrilling action more than make up for it especially with that quite touching ending. Plus, I love that the film allowed the plot to expand on more worlds and regions with new abilities/obstacles instead of rehashing the same ones again.

427,landenmeadors,Main manz film review,6,4 January 2020,"The final verdict is... enjoyable, not perfect. If you're looking for a pretty good time at the movies and a few genuine laughs that you will forget by the time you get home, I'd say this is for you. Relies heavily on comedy but lacks major substance.COMEDY:
The movie brings to the table some actual good comedy but it feels like it almost gets to the point where there are too many jokes. The film relies heavily on its comedy. If you take away all the comedic moments, and focus on the plot and character development, you really aren't left with much.ACTION/ADVENTURE:
The action in this film is honestly pretty strong. There are moments you'll like if you enjoy wildlife action, though, some of the scenes seem to overstay their welcome. They last a bit too long in some areas.SUBSTANCE/PLOT
The plot of this movie is pretty easy to grasp, but lacks in some areas or is overshadowed for the sake of an unfunny (or in cases funny but not when it overshadows what could be a great plot point) joke.THEMES:
There are moments in the film where themes could be very strong. For example, there is a scene where hot guy and hot girl (idk the names but y'all get it) are having a heart to heart convo and it's honestly really human and moving but it is one of the few scenes in this movie I wish were longer. If you cut out a couple of jokes or cut short an action sequence to make another scene or two like this, I think the film would've benefited strongly.PACING:
Pacing is good in the film and never really drags or rushes itself in the case of all but a few action scenes.",Jumanji - The Next Level
428,wodexiaohaozi,Play a good hand of cards badly,3,3 May 2020,"The idea of people getting into the game and being a part of the game is awesome, and that's why the first one was such a box office smash. Although there are many similar films, they have not yet reached the point of rotten streets.The subject matter is good, but it is a pity that both films are very ordinary.
The first one was at least entertaining, and the sequel is clearly not going to go on, forcing a lot of jokes that are not funny.
It's neither funny nor tear-jerking, and the only feeling is that this popcorn movie is duller than an art house movie.
It is not easy to make such an interesting subject matter so boring.",Jumanji - The Next Level
429,ICMooVees,Hope this is the Last Level,1,4 July 2020,"J:WTTJ had good magic to it and presented a solid continuation off of the original -Fresh idea to be pulled into the game instead of ""our"" world, multiple characters and use of avatars (just like those good ol' games), nice twist of putting players into those avatars making for some good comedy, good character impetus development which the adventure makes use of to help them work out their hang-ups and resolve, some nice homage paid to Alan Parrish, and a good wrap up/closure ending. This mess is a trope-ridden casserole struggling to have all of those ingredients tossed in, shaken, and splashed into a pan hoping that something edible would come out. They reheated everything they could - the hippo, jack blacks quasi-homo deliveries, the now-useless Seaplane character, need-a-clue-get-the-clue-go-quest-for-the-villain-beat-up-baddies-get-the-gem-go-home, and added worse ingredients like the repetitive and irrelevant switching of bodies, animal communication(!!??), along with the whole milo/eddie thing dragged on though out. And I think worse of all was using the same core characters again (Spencer, etc) when their story was already told and came to a nice closure last time. I think a better direction would have been using a new team having new/different life challenges to be fleshed out and resolved by going into Jumanji. That would've been a good concept/meaning to have sequels based on. Obviously this was fast-tracked because of the enormous bank the previous one did and out came this mess.",Jumanji - The Next Level

431,gornasa,A movie to be proud of,8,16 February 2020,"Man, what a step up from the previous movie - which I found amazing, by the way. What I liked about the previous one was that it wasn't a remake of the 90s Jumanji but a completely new story, with great special effects, great acting, a solid story and a lot of humor. In the sequel you have double of everything - except humor, in this one it's literally a laugh a minute.
This is a wonderful family action movie that people of all ages can enjoy. So many good things here:
1: The story. Unlike in most Holywood action movies these days, there's actually a solid story that is made even cooler by the fact that it's taking place in a game, which gives the characters lots of different possibilities. The writers utilized that fact and came up with some very original stuff, which makes the movie all the more interesting, and you can't really predict what's gonna happen. I loved this about the previous movie, the twists were really impressive, but this one tops that.
2. The special effects. Finally the effects are used to enhance the already good story rather than replace it, as it's been happening for years in Hollywood movies. That's what effects are for. There are some really ingenious solutions here and it all looks very realistic and it pulls you into the story.
3. The actors have amazing chemistry, just like in the previous movie, but what I really loved was how The Rock was talking like Danny DeVito's character and Kevin Hart stopped yapping for a change and was talking slowly and taking his time to think like Danny Glover's character (which led to some funny developments in the story). There were some character switches in the game, which was really cool, some actors had to change their acting style because of that - which again led to other funny developments.
All characters' stories were very well managed and linked together, and I was really impressed with Nick Jonas' and Awkwafina's acting.
4 The humor. I don't know how the actors could keep a straight face throughout the movie. I LOVED the subdued, sarcastic humor here. You can still make a movie with no stoner humor, no fart jokes, no rude jokes. All the actors are so natural, there's no trying too hard, so they really pull this off.This is a very entertaining movie with tons of positive energy. It will surprise you more than once, and make you feel good. A great heir to the original Jumanji and a fantastic sequel. Keep 'em coming.",Jumanji - The Next Level

442,austinbmoney,"Not as good as the first one, but still pretty solid",7,13 December 2019,"It is always hard to make a good sequel to a film that was already really good and defied most peoples expectations. Luckily, Jake Kasdan does just that with Jumanji: The Next Level. Just like the first film, this movie has tons of action and lots of laughs, as well as some great performances by the entire cast. It is not quite as good as the first film, as it retreads a lot of the same ideas, and not all of the jokes land, with some of them feeling quite unnecessary. Also, Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart having to act like they are old people does get a little stale after awhile. There are also just a few scenes/ideas in the film that really did not sit well with me, and could have easily been done differently. It sounds like I am just tearing apart the film, but those are really just some minor things that I would have rather seen done differently in the film, and they do not really greatly impact the overall product. In many ways, this film does things better than the first one did. All of the action sequences were very exciting, many of them were on a completely different level than the first film, both in terms of scale and excitement. Another thing that I loved was that these fully grown actors continued to convince me that they really were teenagers that were stuck in these grown up bodies, and that is something that is really hard to do convincingly. Overall, it was a very immersive film that manages to build a strong emotional connection with its characters, as well as improve and build off of many of the ideas that were presented in the first one. The ending also sets up a pretty interesting concept for a potential third film in the series that I would be really intrigued to see.",Jumanji - The Next Level

The players in the game have actually done a pretty good job at embodying the teenagers and the elders. This must have required a great deal of skill. Kevin Hart and Jack Black steal the show in this regard.The special effects in the movie are also pretty decent as well. The ostrich chase scene is the example of that.The story is also coherent.

When the kids came in I was let down quick, I saw the short documentary of the making of Jumanji and the kids weren't in it, so was expecting some new cast. They really weren't needed here because their stories had already been told, because most elements of the movie revolved around them and it made the movie incredibly boring. Having Rory MCann as a lifeless character was a waste of a good actor and his time spent was also brief. Dwayne, Jack, Kevin, and the two Girls were ok, they really weren't given much to work with and honestly at times their characters are ridiculous and unbelievable, but I don't blame them at all. The story is very weak in this movie and what annoyed me the most was the Political Correctness shoved in my face, I don't care who gets along with who, I want to see an exhilarating story where every moment is unpredictable and gripping like the original Jumanji film.

466,monkykid28,Round house Hotta... but seriously this is a good movie,7,2 July 2020,No getting the comment about how hot ruby looks we shall move on. The disappointment in this movie was the way they brought everybody back into the game as well as the horse... also one more point but I'll circle back to it later. In the first movie Spencer's issue was he spent to much time playing video games and was social awkward because of it. In this movie he relapses forcing the friends who he ditched thinking he was not worthy. His friends jumped back in not realizing they also drag in the to elder friends upstairs. This leads to lots of old people jokes some rehashing of previous jokes. Then also even more sexual jokes that have little to do with ruby. Though she still in her same outfit it fits better seeing most of its in the desert and when it's not she gets a costume change. Which comes when one of the characters joins as a horse like really a horse. I'm sorry but when the person who has a crush on the Johnis brother joins the game and the first thing she does is let's him ride her? Other then that great movie,Jumanji - The Next Level

The trailers don't do this movie justice as the trailers had us feeling like it might just be ok. The addition of Danny Devito and Danny Glover's characters, more specifically their personalities, is a great touch. There's a few twists in the film and it's definitely not just more of the same.

472,stop_thebeat,Fun but predictable,6,9 December 2019,"The follow up to the surprise hit of the long awaited Jumanji sequel is, well, basic. It has funny parts but it's also very slow moving to begin with. I honestly didn't care about the characters lives outside of the game. Just get in there & be funny!
You have to endure 20 mins of unoriginal apparent teen angst before you get to the fun stuff. But then for 2019 you see the double standards of Hollywood in all their 'family friendly' glory.
Old people are stereotypical dithering imbeciles.
The black guy keeps going on about being black & how he needs to stop hanging around with white people. Apparently this is funny, but I imagine it wouldn't have been had it been said the other way around.
The bad guy posed no threat, he had no purpose really which was a shame.
Unlike the first film the (lol) kids didn't go on a journey of self discovery & got better from it. Instead it was fractured between a 15 year argument between business partners & the lad who decided he was better as a game character than himself. Forget the game, he needs a Psychiatrist.
The film was obviously made on the popularity of its predecessor & it shows. Even though they destroyed the game in the last film it's back, saved for no apparent reason by one of the lads who swore to never go back!
The horse! Very very very cheap trick. It made no sense for a horse to be a playable character, neither got it to be able to fly. All the other animals in Jumanji are real animals (give or take exaggeration on size etc) then there's a flying horse! But of course!
Magic water! Lazy lazy plot device. And it's been set up for a sequel (Gods help us!)Entertaining: 7/10

Like Welcome to the jungle, most of the jokes land extremely well, and the action was amazing. The villain wasn't bad, but he's not good either, I felt like they could've done the Villain a lot better. In this movie the rock intimidates Danny deVito very poorly, every time when the rock intimidates him, I was very annoyed. Also the third act started kinda poor but starts building up very well, I also thought the first and second acts was done amazing.

Sequals mostly spoil a good first movie if not done right and this one was done half right only. There was some good moments but I found myself saying to myself that this isn't all that great compared to the first one. Some parts of the humor felt forced and not as funny. I was not really a fan of the older actors being in the game either, It got old real quick. Definitely can't rewatch this one but I did rewatch the first one.

There was no real motive for Spencer going back into the game,and therefore dragging everyone else in to save him. He said he wanted to be brave again...so you went into a game where you have to escape being captured and killed?I also did not like the character switch. I think the characters and their roles were the part I liked from the 2017 one. That's why I bought the ticket, hoping to see more of that but they changed the roles around. I felt kinda duped...

For example having The Rock play Danny Devitto's character, and then having Awkwafina play that character, just felt great. The actors do a great job and it was easy to feel like these were people inhabiting characters bodies. I even found it easy to believe that the horse was the characters. Great work on part of the actors and director there.The movie isn't perfect, but it's more a matter of nitpicking than anything. My family and I all enjoyed this movie a lot. Anyway, the nitpicks:I generally hate the way movie writers incorporate STEM, and the 'geometry' talent was the usual. Having a person throw terms that nobody else understands and have little to do with what's happening gives it an 'it's a geek only thing; not cool' vibe. Really, 'linguistics' means that you can clearly explain to people what animals are saying while 'geometry' means you know where to go but can only describe it in a way nobody understands? Writers, if you can't actually respect it and understand it, don't put it in.My son also commented that the bad guys might have been real people who got into the game, due to the way the NPCs actions at the end seemed a lot less scripted and more adaptive than would have been expected based on what we've been shown before on this movie and the previous one.",Jumanji - The Next Level

I find the continuation to be an impressive confusion and mindbend this one delivered compared to the first sequel, a lot more edgy and a lot more to bring within deep meanings. It is amazing how they didn't lose orientation when producing this, this impressive sequel deserves some respect whether you appreciate the first sequel or not.I can not shut up about how impressive the video game being all glitched-up in a similar vein reminiscing to 90s/00s video games and consoles. Every time I think of this sequel, it managed to impress as great as the first one to the original 1995 one.I found even the actors and actresses imitating each other actually is a great poke and tongue-in-cheek to each other on set. Voice actors, if you hadn't been cancelled or walked away, this film is footnote on how to do voice imitations without coming off offensive and sounding more authentic than vocalising a stereotype.

It's an Insult to original Jumanji that supposed to be meaningful movie but Entertaining nonetheless.Plus:
The Rock, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan is back. Well it's good to know they have loyal cast. They even consistently to look exact same like the last movie, that often change in most movie sequels.The story is not repeating the 1st movie, even that should be not possible but yeah this is refreshing.The real life characters (Teens) also make return. They changed a little bit so I kinda don't recognize other than Spencer at first.My God, Danny Devito is in this. He's still got it and blend well. Surprisingly giving Spencer characters more development than the 1st movie.The settings of world still Jungle but there's more cities, structures and the hanging bridge is eye pleasing.Minus:
I know they tried new thins like placing Danny to the Rock, Glover to Kevin Hart, Blain to Jack Black. But IDK Kevin Hart deep voice without annoying scream, The Rock become careless and never think, Jack Black isn't speak like girl is not enjoyable. Exactly like Turner as Karen Gillan thinking.

Even the console and cartridge is broken.The Antagonist Jurgen The Brutal isn't behaving like NPC. I expect he's a player too but somewhere but what a letdown. It's strange he's like the most aware NPC in the movie except he doesn't know the players is human.The pool of changing characters is not creative. They should be do something more exciting. Also judging by video games PoV, what's the purpose of choosing characters first if you will switch again randomly in middle of gameplay with no truly different quest? Especially this is an ""old game"" not a brand new PC game. Also it appears before final boss.The ability panel that somewhat random should be utilized more. The characters mostly isn't the upgrade of last movie. More like downgrade.The Milo horse flying breaking the theme of somewhat realistic jungle of Jumanji. Now I'm expect Dragons, Chimera, Cerberus, even Cthulhu in next movie if there will be one. Idk it's just too mainstream. Why there's always unicorn or pegasus in western fantasy? No other creature that tameable and rideable??The game came outside the cartridge as ending is making the 3rd sequel more complicated. How is The Rock, Karen, JB, and Kevin characters do in real world? They can't act exact same like 1st and 2nd movie.

So the dialog is written to keep audience in a happy place and without going deep into ""what and how"" the story unfolds with it's twists and turns almost flawlessly, so 2 hours pass with ease.
All the actors play nicely separated (physically and emotionally) characters and this alone makes this movie a good watch. It's a very borderline family show.

The new characters, albeit played by legends of the game Danny Glover, and Danny DeVito, do not belong in this storyline...and the addition of Akwardfina is just a complete disappointment. Not only is she a horrible actress in general, but she can't even make slapstick in a children's film believable. Johnson, Hart, Black and Gillan do a fabulous job once again and the writers Jake Kasdan and Jeff Pinkner seem to have taken the magical world of Jumanji to the next level yet again. If it weren't for the lame acting at the onset and the addition of these random characters who do nothing to progress the plot, slow the action and dialogue to a snails pace as though the audience were having to look over their shoulders and wonder where grandpa is, it might be just as great as it was meant to be.

Even at 12-13, I don't really want my kids hearing constant expletives throughout the entire movie. Almost gratuitous in some scenes. Anyway - it had a pretty slow start but was good once it got going. Dwayne Johnson was hilarious doing DeVito same within Kevin Hart doing Glover (Not enough screen time for Glover!)

550,CarolWolf,What is Wrong with this Movie?,3,23 December 2019,"The concept of Jumanji is hugely fun - kids get sucked into a video game. The first one was just that. In this sequel, main character Spencer has been diminished to an ineffective self-pitying incompetent who blows off his incredibly hot girlfriend Bethany because, after leaving for college, he feels unworthy of her. (Huh? Never happen.)On coming home for Christmas, instead of going to see the old team, and hooking up again with this - did I mention she was incredibly hot? - girlfriend, he feels so sorry for himself, he goes into the Jumanji world, even though he knows that by himself, he could die there, or get stuck there forever. So, suicide by video game.But his friends won't let that happen, they're going to risk their lives for him and go after him. Great!Then, two more people get sucked into the game. Spencer's crochety, debilitated Grampa, and Grampa's long-winded boring friend.You can tell the scene between the two old men doesn't belong in this film. Check this out: Spencer has disappeared. Significant problem! Friends are going looking for him. Significant tension! Milo comes over to talk to Grampa. No tension at all. That is an indication that the story has a glitch.Grampa and Milo are taking about their relationship. It's true they have conflict with each other, but there are no consequences to the story for this conflict, so it has no effect; it creates no tension in the story. In fact, Grampa and Milo's whole story arc has no effect on the Jumanji story arc at all. Every time they have a scene together, the tension level bottoms out, just as it does when they are sitting at the kitchen table talking to each other. And yet they are the ones who get sucked into the game.Ever gone on a road trip and found out someone has invited Miserable, Complaining, Never Enjoys Anything, Never Stops Making Nasty Cracks guy? That is when you bail out of the car! Right then! And if you don't bail out of the car, you isolate the guy, you put him in the 'way back, you give him a headset, you separate him out so he doesn't ruin the trip for everyone else. Instead, because this is Spencer's Special Grampa, everyone kowtows to him, everyone carries him along, like he's some kind of gross spoiled toddler. A much better plan would be to let him get killed off quickly - so he doesn't kill you! Like he keeps doing!So, launched into this story that should be a whole lot of fun, we are saddled with a hero you can't identify with (self-pitying and ineffectual - not a character you can root for), and an old crochety guy and his boring friend who have hijacked the story.What if, instead, it goes like this: Spencer goes off to college, and Bethany joins a group to go help people by building houses overseas (as stated in the film). There, she meets an older, attractive, capable guy with the same values, and she is the one blowing off Spencer. When Spencer comes home, excited to see his old team, he hurries to the restaurant and finds Bethany there first, kissing the new boyfriend. That would send him into the game, in the hope that the old team - and Bethany - would come and get him out again, and they'd all be back to normal.Then, instead of sucking in two characters who do not enjoy or engage with the Jumanji world, how about the days-from-retiring postman, who happens to come to the house at that moment. She is debilitated, tired of life, knows everyone in the neighborhood, and she's played by Whoopee Goldberg. Whoopee gets sucked into the game, and enjoys the heck out of her avatar - trying everything it can do - and the world, to the point where she keeps trying to explore places you can't go. Having the time of her life, and disrupting the rescue mission with her enthusiasm. Everything she did would be a surprise to us. It would be joyful and fun.Or, how about the disabled scientist next door (think Stephen Hawking, if her were still alive), sucked into the game, gains an avatar who can move and fight and speak, and a world whose magical physics he can explore. He, too, would enjoy the heck out of it, and so would we. Joy and enthusiasm are contagious - and so is misery. Miserable Grampa has hijacked this story and sucked the fun out of it.Or, when Bethany goes to get help from Alex, how about his kids get sucked into the story instead? Especially a little kid. A little girl, playing one of the men, and having the time of her life suddenly knowing things, or able to do things, and having tantrums when crossed. Now THAT would have been FUN! And the actors, playing a little girl playing their avatar, would have had fun too.Grampa's problem with Milo is so stupid is hurts. They used to own a restaurant in town together. Milo cooked a hundred plates a day in this restaurant for 35 years. He wanted to retire, so he forced Grampa to sell the restaurant, and he went and had fifteen enjoyable years traveling around with his wife. Grampa hasn't spoken to him in all that time, in 15 years, because he is so angry that he lost the restaurant, his purpose in life, and his partner. (Tell this story to three different people: ""There are these two guys who . . . "" What kind of reactions would you get? Boredom and indifference. That is a clue!)And another thing. While the black guy was in the kitchen cooking a hundred plates a day, what was Crabby Grampa doing? Managing? If he was managing, but the black guy was cooking, how is that a partnership? And if they own the restaurant, couldn't they hire a cook? If Milo wanted to retire, couldn't they train a new cook and Grampa can keep on running the restaurant? It just doesn't make sense.The resolution to this arc is that at the end of their Jumanji adventure, they apologize to each other. And, once again, this has absolutely no effect on the story. Which is how you can tell it doesn't belong there.The movie, which starts with Spencer, and is supposed to be about Spencer, ends with Grampa. Grampa goes to this restaurant that he ran for 35 years, and meets Nora, the new owner, who is at her wit's end because she can't keep a manager. Oh? Says Grampa, you need a manager?Nora is characterized as a nincompoop, because she would have to be a nincompoop to hire the guy who used to own the restaurant, and managed it for 35 years. She will never get her way again, if she does. But she isn't a nincompoop. Restaurants close every day, and she has kept this one going for 15 years.And then, the unkindest cut of all - Grampa comes on to her. He gives her Bravestone's stormy look. Yup. Just the guy you want to have working for you; the old guy who's coming on to you. That's why they have to characterize Nora as a nincompoop. Otherwise she would have a real-world, real woman's reaction, and that would not make the story end well for Grampa.So, the end of Grampa's arc is that after fifteen years he gets his restaurant back. And he's starting a romance with Nora. But this is a huge pay-off to a set-up that isn't there. This is Spencer's story. This is about Jumanji, and the effect that Jumanji has on the lives of the people who are sucked into it. Except for Grampa and Milo.The mise en scene is spectacular. I could almost forgive the whole film for the dirigible the end. That was marvelous! The villain's fortress, the extreme desert, the hanging bridges, were fantastic. The mix of ancient and modern, strange trucks and cars, and camels, was wonderful. The villain's horde of evil minions being full of women - not female hangers on, but evil women minions - was delightful! Thank you for that!In thinking back over the film, each scene was well-shaped, well-timed, with interesting events, moved the plot from one place to another (except the Grampa-Milo scenes), in often surprising ways. If only the characters had not been talking, the scenes would have been much better. The verbiage often undermined the strength of the scenes. Which is odd - great verbiage is usually a lot easier to write than great scenework. But since the characters are being twisted to serve the head-trips of the writers, it makes sense that it would turn out that way.Jumanji II is a wonderful idea, that has been hijacked for Cute Crusty Miserable Grampa and his boring friend. Like stealing toys from children, it stinks, especially when the thieves never liked the toys after all. They handle them and dump them. They never have any fun with it, and so, neither do we.",Jumanji - The Next Level

It's sad because The Rock can actually be a great actor (see his movie Faster).

Fine....Jumanji : The Next Level is a direct sequel to the 2017 Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle which was a soft reboot of the 1995 film Jumanji.Spencer, the lead from the previous film is having a hard time at college and finds himself back in the video game Jumanji. However things don't go as planned and his friends have to jump back into the game to rescue him. This time the game also sucks in Spencer's grandfather, played by Danny DeVito and his old business partner Danny Glover (in the best role he's had in well over a decade).This time however, the players don't get to choose thier characters and this creates an interesting fish-out-of-water situation that the film employs to it's absolute best use. Moreover, the dual roles pull some surprisingly good impressions from our main video game cast and showcases a range you might not expect from stars like Dwayne Johnson or Terry Crews.Jumanji has a tricky line to walk. Adventure/Comedy is a tough sell, yet Jumanji manages to craft a rollicking good adventure with action and peril, while never completely abandoning the humor. There are of course a fair amount of cheap shots and pratfalls,
the movie does feature Jack Black after all. However there's a lot of smart jokes, and humor that doesn't rely on the lowest common denominator. It's exactly the kind of comedy that I love and it never lets up.Throughout the film, there's a lot of heart, exploring interpersonal relationships against the backdrop of the adventure and ends with a genuine punch the air moment. The film is unfettered by politics and agendas and may actually be the most fun I've had at the movies this year.",Jumanji - The Next Level
577,eheath1000,"A reasonable, entertaining effort",7,14 December 2019,"OK, I liked seeing Dwayne Johnson channel a 16 year old nerd in the last new Jumanji reboot. And I thought Kevin Hart and Jack Black were pretty good in stretching themselves a little (Black maybe more of a stretch, and maybe a bit better). And I just like Karen Gillian.I have to say, in this film, both Johnson and Hart played their new characters better than the originals played themselves. I especially enjoyed Johnson's mugging as DeVito in his body.Its not Richard Burton, but it is entertaining and to me perfectly credible.The fact that they didn't include Bebe Neuwirth in the first round of credits in the end credits was criminal.",Jumanji - The Next Level

But, all went really sad from the first scene.I will not go into the story line, what was bad and what was good. But I will tell you one thing. The whole experience was dull and boring.The worst part was editing, useless monologues where kept, that kept was going on and on and on for ever.I had to keep my self busy between the scenes so not to give up completely and finish it.All in all, again one more sequel destroyed.Oh yeah, some special effects scenes were good. 2 stars for that.",Jumanji - The Next Level

Don't get me wrong, I fully understand that for a PG 13 rating the writers have to refrain from dropping F-bombs, gratuitous sex scenes etc. Why then is it okay to take the Lords name in vain, and that's supposed to be perfectly acceptable for children at a somewhat impressionable age?

580,dementedoracle,Superb example of a sequel that delivers on the original,8,18 May 2020,"There's something to respect about a production that can perfectly reproduce a winning formula. There's a reason this movie's rating is so close to the ""Welcome to the Jungle"". It's just as good, in the best way possible.I mean, sure, you have an occasional success story where a first film is good, and the second is just far and away better (seemingly 99% of which are solely thanks to James Cameron), but mostly what we want from a sequel is a return to the same positive experience we had before, and this movie delivers beautifully. I laughed just as much, loved every character, found just as many new videogame in-jokes to admire. There was just enough of a twist on the plot to keep it fresh, yet still in touch with the first movie, and the same can be said for all the new characters--it all fit right into place.This could easily have been called Jumanji: Vol. 2. If you liked WttJ you'll like TNL just as much, for all the same reasons.",Jumanji - The Next Level

The comedy is top notch for modern audiences and uses characters that are highly relatable. Throughout the film I kept thinking of my grandparents while watching Danny de Vito's character interact with modern technology.
This movie is perfect for the mainstream movie goer, as it has action and comedy that might appeal to any demographic sector. The development is what you would expect for a holiday blockbuster, but it doesn't make the movie tedious.

more jokes;a whole lot of new characters;a fresh look at the existing characters;plenty of new locations and thus, much more adventures;an absolute muddle of what's happening on the screen;and yes, even more jokes!Given the above, it's time to wrap it up - «Jumanji: The Next Level» is a solid following of a 2017's movie.

I watched TNL yesterday and let's begin with the negative things :Negatives :* Characters trying to explain the whole Jumanji thing again was like urgh. Already saw it in the last movie.* The fact that this sequel was built on the grounds of whims of a teenager being insecure.* Some of the acting was very cringe worthy and the jokes not funny.

Following the unfortunate traditions of modern film industry, I expected a watered-down, less funny version of the first one. Thankfully, I was wrong.
The plot is rather simple and very easy to follow. It wraps up quite nicely, leaving the viewer satisfied and with all his questions answered. The jokes are still there; with great comedic timing and subtle inside gags, they are enough to make everyone laugh. The actors should be praised, and with improvements to the character(s) of the fantastic leading four, it's nice to see some new faces who contribute to the general atmosphere of the movie.
Overall quite enjoyable, left the cinema smiling. It's what you would expect from a movie as such, but in no way does it make you regret watching it.

It was appart of my childhood and I was upset that they felt the need to remake it and turn it into a franchise. Which actually is the one thing I'm upset about....This movie is without a doubt really fun to watch. A couple of critiques I have is that the acting wasn't great. HOWEVER. The actors who are playing the game avatars who are imitating their teenage/elder counterparts do an amazing job of playing those characters. But the dialog can be cheesey at times but it's targeted towards kids I guess. The film ends and we get an after credits scene which opens it up for an unecessary sequel.

Wooden acting, poor comic timing, silly special effects, unnecessary music, bad casting.I love Dwain Johnson in most, if not all, his other movies but this...was a waste of time. 90 minutes of my life I will not get back.

Hey guess what, the film is called 'the next level' and that is that is exactly what it is. So if you enjoyed the previous one, then it's a fair bet that you will enjoy this one as well.Yes there are some new characters here to add a little more to the story, but the format is essentially the same. Get into the game, solve a few riddles, get past some challenges, defeat some bad guys, and rescue something to achieve the goal and restore normality to Jumanji.The action and humour are just like before and the characters essentially do the same things as before but with a few little tweaks here and there. If you're going into this expecting a completely different film, then you'll be disappointed, but then you would also be a little naive to really expect anything different.Overall it's fun, with plenty of action and a similar vibe throughout to the previous movie.

Several funny lines, and it was pretty hilarious to see the different characters ""be"" different people than in the first one.Awkwafina was hands-down the best part of this movie. She was hilarious, and she outshone the rest of the cast!Jack Black. I've never been a huge fan, but the dude is hilarious.The Dannys were also very funny!Cons:Not as funny or engrossing as the first one.The story line isn't nearly as engaging, and the dialogue seemed very forced at times.A massive increase in the amount of adult language and inappropriate scenes, including one decently long scene that involved talking about a man's lack of genitalia.
Overall, this was a sequel that didn't have to be made. I still enjoyed it, but I would recommend waiting to go to it and renting it instead.

674,fibermonster,A masterpiece!,3,12 December 2019,"When I went to see this movie I had low expectations, but this film is almost as good as the book Great Expectations! Jake Kasdan is an artist, kind of like Jackson Pollock. He intricately blends themes with other things and uses a unique combination of cliché and convention to create a Hollywood blockbuster that will have you saying ""yeah it was good"" as soon as God gracefully ends the movie.
I really thought the plot twists like ""the boy kisses the girl in the end"" and ""they collected an object that dramatically saves them later"" were brilliant, original additions that had me gripping my seat like I had been strapped to an airplane wing. Or when a character turned out to have cancer. The director did such a skilful job of character development that it was almost as sad as when the mother had cancer in The Room.
I was absolutely quivering with anxiety when Ivan was about to chop some heads off because there wasn't a strong female character around. Then, to my absolute astonishment, a strong female character arrived! All this happened while there were other elements, too. Truly a genius movie!
I think this movie's strong suit is dialogue. Take this example, for instance. At the end they're all sitting in a coffee shop and the one who got them into the whole mess said ""let's all agree to never do that again"" after he had been openly blamed for the whole thing without serious explanation. It shows that they don't need to follow standard conventions of logic and consistency and that they are pioneers of some unknown form of reality which I have yet to learn. And when they stick to standard themes and generic dialogue it reminds me of how good those Star Wars sequels were to the originals and how good this movie is compared to the Robin Williams Jumanji. You just can't beat it!
Overall, this movie does a FANTASTIC job of following the disaster created by one character and the fun filled laugh riot that follows. It makes me want to riot, too! So well done Jake Kasdan for directing this disaster! I want my money back!",Jumanji - The Next Level

It was truly painful to listen to, first Dwayne Johnson sounds like some old rabbi from Brooklyn and then Awkwafina too, was infected with a horrible accent.
I mean Danny was in the movie, I'm sure he was available for reference. I can't understand what they were basing their voice acting on and why it was allowed to be. Really threw off a lot of the movie.
As soon as both older characters went into the game, it was a given cliche that one would stay behind to live forever instead of dying. So there was no surprise there at all.
Instead of the people learning to adapt and overcome with their new avatars, it was conveniently written in to have a magic water to switch bodies, of course. Lame writing.
Overall it was ok. Jack Black and Karen Gillian easily carried the better parts of the movie. Kevin did ok but his imitation of being the old Danny Glover was also off putting. Oddly Dwayne didn't stand out as the main lead so much this go around.
Typical sequel bad karma, but not the worst movie. The body swapping was lazy and convenient. The imitations were unnecessary, especially the poorly done ones. Black and Gillian pulled it off well. Passable.",Jumanji - The Next Level

I was so excited they were in this movie because these are icons and legends from my childhood and I don't think I have seen them in a movie together before and certainly not with Jack Black and the Rock.Again very impressed about how different actors convincingly portray the same character; for example the character played by Danny de Vito who lands in to body of The Rock who then continues to play that same character very convincingly.This is just a fun movie to watch.",Jumanji - The Next Level

718,georgenlee-61866,"A decent quality movie at 1st sight until the latter time, the next level in runtime, darkness and a downward spiral",4,24 April 2020,"Jumanji was a hit since the original came out and the original had such a 1 of a kind plot that made it famous and adventurous yet good for many to watch. This one while had good visuals and a story, didn't match to the original. 1st of all different cast members, starring Dwayne Johnson (the Rock), Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. They did fine on their roles though you will NEVER get another like Robin Williams (who committed suicide by hanging too soon R.I.P.). The action was fitting for Jumanji movies and certainly a step over the original, plus quite the adventure of movies, including intense scenes with creepy jungle animals, which added to the story. Now the movie was even longer than the 1st, up to 2 hours 3 minutes compared to the 1 hour 44 minute original movie, so just 2 minutes shy of the original 1977 Star Wars movie Episode IV - A New Hope. Now it's definitely flawed, in fact BIG TIME! with the massive amount of profanity in this movie, like 50 swear words in total, more than what most movies have, with 6 uses of God's name in vain being taken in that way and many uses of the H word and D word along with many others including the F word. I get they wanted to give this the PG-13 route but this was extreme even for that in such matters. Yet like I said earlier it was darker than the original in action sequences. I know action movies are enjoyable but some of the types used in this are going over the edge for what would've been a family movie. This isn't Star Wars, Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, but neither is this supposed to be Sesame Street, this is supposed to be Jumanji, a fine balance which the original had but this pushed that boundary. Too bad a pity some movie franchises choose to take a darker route as they go on, like Harry Potter did that and so did Narnia and even Star Wars. Same thing with Jumanji. Yet this movie is unique though another flaw happens even before watching the movie, with the fact that I realized when it was in theaters, the theaters including staff and entrances didn't put up warning signs that the cinematography would involve tons of handheld camera work in scenes, making the footage shaky, which can trigger dizziness/motion sickness in susceptible guests and that viewers prone to motion sickness should either sit next to the entrance/exit door or ask the cashier for further admission or just not watch, yet it was definitely different from the 1st movie in that matter as well. I mean also think about the people who might've gotten sick watching this movie, yet the 3D aspects in the 3D versions makes such matters even worse for them. If movies like the Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, District 9, Project Almanac, Jason Bourne, Battle LA or Earth to Echo make you sick, then its the same with this (and Rogue One + Solo). Not everyone's in the same health or physical shape anyway. Anyway the acting as well didn't live up to the original standards and this movie definitely made no match to the original. It's an example of how some sequels (including this) fall flat and inferior to the originals. Some just try to hard to be as good and don't. Now don't get me wrong, it's better than what Star Wars became since the sequel trilogy (and after George Lucas sold it to Disney), but it's not as good as the original and nor is it as family friendly either, with full of profanity along with intense scenes and especially sexual innuendos. If you loved the the 1st movie, then don't go in expecting this to be as innocent as the original. It's definitely the mature version of Jumanji. Just like how Indiana Jones went dark with their most famous hit Raiders of the Lost Ark, this movie took a dark step and took the family-friendly aspect away. This movie doesn't even get 5 stars due to such reasons. While this was refreshing compared to lots of movies out there in quality and storyline, it's not the breath of fresh air you're looking for whereas Mary Poppins Returns was a better sequel to an original movie (like Mary Poppins) than this was to the original Jumanji. Yet you could also watch YouTube clips of it or YouTube fanfilms or even vlogs by the cast members, which this ""movie"" practically was. Never forget the legendary Robin Williams who made the original Jumanji classic and the fact that no one will ever live up to his quality in the movie industry or Jumanji's movies anymore. R.I.P. Robin Williams.",Jumanji - The Next Level

And while this was the case with the general themes (the different levels style of the plot, some of the strengths), others took a new and exciting turn.The humour of The Next Level, specifically the new dynamic between Dwayne Johnson as Eddie, and Kevin Hart as Milo. The acting and writing came together to provide a thoroughly entertaining combination.My only gripe with the movie was that, with the rightful addition of two new characters, there was not enough room for the old ones to shine. Nick Jonas' character felt unnecessary, and as if the writers were forced to add him in. This was evident when, within minutes of being reintroduced to him, he lost two of his three lives simply being shot at by poisonous darts. Either adding him in earlier, or just getting Alex (Colin Hanks) to help Madison Iseman (Bethany) get into the game, instead of himself going in as well, would have saved the audience some confusion, and cut down some unnecessary scenes.In conclusion, however, the film was a great follow-up to the first sequel, and judging from that end-credits scene, cannot wait for the next installment!",Jumanji - The Next Level

Going into it, I was hoping to get to see characters I loved in the first film return, Spencer, Fridge, Martha and Bethany. I was hoping to see character growth, as expected from a sequel. My excitement quickly dwindled when I realized the movie prioritized the actors over their actual characters. Make no mistake, this movie, is about Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black, as they play completely different characters from the ones we were introduced. These new characters, Eddie and Milo, add in my opinion absolutely nothing to the story. They simply get in the way of the character growth you'd expect to see in a sequel. Nick Jonas' Alex unnecessarily returns in this sequel, and while I loved him in the first, his character was completely useless to the sequel. Spencer is MIA for the majority of the film, until he becomes Bravestone again and is now the main focus of the movie again.Admittedly, it's dumb fun. There are amusing jokes, I enjoyed the new environments and location. If you're going into it for the characters, for Spencer, Martha, Fridge or Bethany, don't bother.

The movie/game isn't only the next level, but also a new edition, where like all other games it will be with new adventures, new skills, etc.
The acting leaves me convinced that they are the characters they are supposed to be, which I always find impressive in movies like this with identity-changes, or what to call it.

I saw this with my 14 year old son because he enjoyed the first one. The ""jokes"" (if you can call them that) were incredibly lame, and the acting was was ridiculously bad (not in a ""so bad it's good"" way).

782,maxpowles,Flawed Sequel With Flat Falling Humor,3,22 January 2020,"This will contain spoilers (if you really care).Going into the movie I thought it would better than the first in this new series of Jumanji films, as my cousins had said it was to be better, but I was clearly wrong. The whole plot is that Spencer wants to go back into Jumanji because he feels anxious and unwanted, and he thinks that going back into the near destroyed game would turn him back into Dr Bravestone. If they can't even manage to do this right there's something wrong going on.The Good:
One of the things I was surprised to like was how the dynamic between the two old grandpas was. I was expecting to not like this by the look of the trailers but it turned out all right. The whole thing was pretty cliché though as it was the similar plot: old people who used to be friends meet up again after a long time, old people argue, one of old people is really sick and is going to die, other old person feel sad, old people become friends. This cliché subplot made the ending to the subplot less impactful, but I still had fun with it. Also the acting from the Rock and Kevin was quite good for their usual acting.The Bad:
As I stated in my introduction they couldn't manage to satisfy me (and I'm sure others) on the ending to the main character's, Spencer, arc. It begins with him feeling anxious and not needed, which are normal thoughts for a human being, so he decides to go into a half destroyed Jumanji expecting to become Dr Bravestone. Spencer's friends then find out and go to save him. Once they all find him he apologises. Then later through the movie Spencer and Martha sort things out between them in a very fast and unbelievable scene. Then at the end he apologises again. Don't you see the terrible character writing here? He doesn't show any sort of comfort towards the end of the movie because he's played by an average actor.Another thing that bugged me was the other characters. They don't even change their thoughts and opinions around the events of what is happening which makes the ending with the group of friends even more meaningless and somewhat cheesy. The character played by one of the Jonas Brothers felt like a plot device and I felt nothing for him at all.One of the major things I was anticipating in this movie was the humor but oh boy was I disappointed. Since it was the same old plot with terrible ""character development"", if you can call it that, the humor a lot of the time fell flat and isn't funny. There are a lot of times in this movie where they try to make it funny but it just turns out very weird and awkward and either makes you laugh from the strangeness or keeps you silent.The plot is a recycled, rubbish plot from the first one, there is a new bad guy with no character and personality who wants to steal a jewel that could threaten life as we know it! The movies excuse for the terrible writing of the events in the videogame is that it's a videogame, but this makes no sense as there are great videogames out there that tell better story than this, Halo, Cod etc.The Conclusion:
Overall this is a really flawed a money making made movie with less than average character development, poor comedy and recycled plot. I do not recommend this if you think about movies with a critical thought but if you are a casual movie watcher you could have some dumb fun.",Jumanji - The Next Level

But that's mainly with Martha and Spencer; Fridge and Bethany have grown in the first movie and a little bit off screen so they dont have much self conflict.All in all this film is great, I personally like this one more than the proteseser movie.Great film worth the money.",Jumanji - The Next Level

I like the comedy speciely the grand fa and fridge I laughed a lot in them scenes
I loved the new persons
I liked in the beginning the fact that the grandparents did not know the world, so it was difficult, just as the team did in the first part But unfortunately, in an Indian way, they added magic water, they did not explain why it was capable, and the water made this matter so easy that I feared the villain more, and here we recognize a fundamental weakness, which is that the whole story revolves around the emotional problem of Spencer Unfortunately, they did not explain the reason for his condition and how his condition improved So I get used to and I say if they continued on the approach of characters that do not fit the original characters, it would have been better because it would make it clear to me that Spencer accepted his weak personality because he succeeded and defeated the villain for a weak-built character.
I think the reason why Spencer had a habit of running the game was very vague and superficial
The focus of the film was not on the story and the difficulties as much as it was to introduce new characters so I did not feel the story and events, especially the character of the villain, as if it were a doll

And frankly there isn't much more happening than the last time. However, it is the kind of treatment they went for this time.Karen Gillan gets a different character briefly and justifies it. Jack Black too gets a different character than before. But it is the new ""old"" characters which they added that works smoothly (with ""grease""). How they react and try to understand, takes up the majority of the runtime. That helps Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart to showcase and play with their characters. And all this is thought out so well that it is outright hilarious. Sure it was repetitive but writing and enactment is done so well that every time it landed into laughs. Everyone submerged into their respective characters very well.Action sequences were decent enough to keep you at the edge of your seat. The plot hadn't much but could have delved just a little deeper into two in-game characters than it did, which you'll know if and when you see.Other than that, it expands slightly more into the world building; you may or may not remember it later but you'll surely enjoy watching it. It definitely is a fun time at the theatre with your friends and/or family.However the nostalgia element that was till now missing in these reboot/sequel (s) is hinted at the end.

Everything falls into place when it needs to. Even the casting itself is just so transparent. Of course including the one sassy black character who throws in the occasional ""I gotta stop hanging out with white people!"" line.Yes you guessed it - the storyline consists of the cast having to return a sacred gem that was stolen by a big evil bad guy!

850,nemravik,Like adventure movie of old,7,16 December 2019,"The latest Jumanji is a great adventure movie that, without taking itself too seriously, still delivers a surprisingly poignant message. While the previous film used game avatars and the idea of becoming someone else as a novel take on teenage insecurity, this movie expands the same setup to include the grandparents and their reluctance to accept old age. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart are now playing two estranged old friends, with a large bone to pick. And oh boy, do they pull this odd couple act off!!! It is exactly this back-and-forth between characters that makes the scenes work. The action set-pieces are fun, but the screenplay shines when it slows down for the banter. Jumanji then feels like a movie, that is not made very often today. Action movies always have explosive scenes, but adventure movies have a heart. And that is where Jumanji hits home.",Jumanji - The Next Level

It was funny, watchable for multiple viewings, entertaining, and creative. When they announced a sequel for it I didn't think it was necessary but was going to check it out regardless. The Next Level is not as good as its predecessor and has less laughs, however its a decent action adventure film that attempts to carry on a franchise.The film takes place around the holidays where the group of kids from the first film get together. Spencer, goes back into the game of Jumanji after feeling unfulfilled and his friends join in. However, this time around Spencer's grandpa and his grandpas friend also enter. Also, this time around the game has changed. The stakes are higher and they have to play through a different level of Jumanji. The crew must band together and get into the right playable character to get themselves out of the dangers of the world of Jumanji.The film is not as humorous as the first and feels like it has to tread similar ground, with things not being as fun the second time around. There are laughs though mostly through having the grandparent and friend personality shine through in the game. This film also explores different regions of Jumanji and is much more action and effects heavy.

The subtle adult humor jokes were an added plus.

917,TheYoshiPhase,"Strong, Hilarious Movie!",9,14 January 2020,"I watched this movie with my dad and cousin a few days after this movie's release after I also watched 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' (2017) two years ago. I definitely was not expecting this movie to match up to - if not be better than - its predecessor.I loved how the themes the movie attempted to portray tied in during the movie; it shows us that everyone's perfect the way they are already, and, well, nobody has to live up to fictional characters (like the way Spencer felt he had to sorta re-experience the way Dr Bravestone was, which was why he entered 'Jumanji' again). Although the themes of plot looked vague and unclear at first look into the movie, as I rewatched scenes of the movie (I can use a movie inbox to rewatch it at any time), the story started to make sense and I understood why every part existed in the movie.The humor, too. Can't argue with that (unless you're one of the few people with a different sense of humor than I do)! The jokes just weave into the plot. They were neither boring and forgettable nor to gut-busting so that I'd miss the other jokes. The character interactions definitely did help with the humor, too - I got to find out who the new people were in personality, and said personalities weaved in to reuse typical people clichés in an original way. It was also hilarious to see the reactions when different people were controlling different video game characters!Also, this movie retained many features of the 'Jumanji' game as did its predecessors, so that the story wouldn't get quite lost. I'm surprised people in my high school didn't talk about this movie over the past few days. However, I would definitely give a thumbs-up to how the movie turned out.",Jumanji - The Next Level

And bethany will be left behind to help the avatars go back to jumanji or something like that. Npcs like nigel could've entered the real world also to give the avatars their task on how to return to jumanji.

GD was used so much, it was ridiculous, but not just that one. The language was uncalled for. It was terrible! My husband and I was disgusted, and I would highly recommend anyone with a smidgen of conscious to skip this movie. If you have younger children, it's a definite no.
My suggestion, if they decide to come out with a third movie is clean those filthy mouths. Consider your audience and young viewers. Would you be that filthy toward a Muslim or Buddhist, and disrespect their gods? No.
Then please use that same consideration to the Christian viewers. Whether you support our values or convictions or not, you're still putting our money in your pocket when we're viewing your movies.

I was pleasantly surprised by the 2017 movie for it's story, effects, fresh ideas and not taking itself too serious.This movie right here has none of that. It is a blatant copy of the 2017 movie and instead of adding anything useful or entertaining, it only adds annoying things. What stands out the most are the 2 old guys that are being forced into the plotline and that are annoying to watch, even before the ""inside the game"" part of the movie eben begins. Nobody cares about their story and after it becomes apparent that they're gonna be part of the main characters you almost want to watch something else. And that feeling turns out to be right: none of their jokes feel right, their dialogue is the same throughout their entire movie, they add nothing to the plot. They feel like dead weight the whole time!Watching Dwayne Johnson play an old Danny DeVito is not entertaining and it takes up the majority of the movie. Same goes for Kevin Hart playing an old black dude. That would've been ok for like 10 minutes, but this movie is 2hours and 30minutes long!The plot lingers on and is full of dangerous things that are not dangerous looking back at them. The segment with the bridges (how does ""geometry"" help here?!) was excruciatingly annoying and boring. I didn't root for the group at all. Wow, they won in the end because the horse can fly.

991,tkl-52011,Typical,6,6 December 2019,"Well.. it's a fun movie. That's all. Nothing new. A movie that's suitable for couples, friends or family for a good laugh and time spending. Almost forgot, there's a post credit scene too.",Jumanji - The Next Level

993,bohead51,"Funnier to add elderly, than kids?",7,9 December 2019,"First film was a ""Rock"" movie, sequel belongs to Gillan. It works almost as well. Having the original cast return for the sequel is practically a must for me.
Glover and Devito add nothing to the film, unless ridiculous elderly stereotypes are your thing.
The ""action"" sequences are a bit more ridiculous, and I had to remind myself that's ""it's a game"".",Jumanji - The Next Level
994,fransiskus_kuskus,"5x Better than the first one, trust me!!",8,5 December 2019,It has better action sequence n feels like a video games level design.,Jumanji - The Next Level
995,bogdanmihajlovic,I don't see the point of making this movie,1,17 February 2020,"Bad acting, bad cgi, bad jokes, bad everyting.
I Only like acting by Jack Black.
Rock isn't acting at all, he behaved as he did at home, i could do it for a lot less money and ofc 100% natural.",Jumanji - The Next Level
996,chocob,Better than expected!,7,26 December 2019,"Comparing this to the prequel one i am surprised to see this one being more funnier. It had good jokes, more characters, and justification to each roles. Addition of the new characters brought more humour and the plot was better than the prequel one.
I disliked the way it ended in the previous one but this one had a lot better meaning towards the end.Entertaining one for the holidays season coming up!",Jumanji - The Next Level
997,mnmbug-24639,"Great actors, awful storyline",4,4 April 2020,"This movie is filled to the brim with great actors and great comedy, but the storyline is absolutely awful. They had so much potential but let it all go down the drain. This movie is just painful to watch.",Jumanji - The Next Level

999,nicholson-19428,Found it a bit boring,5,8 December 2019,"It was quite slow and boring in places compared to the first jumanji.

1000,emmakays,Movie worth seeing on the big screens,9,23 December 2019,I never review movies but this one actually is worth reviewing. A great movie to watch with your family on the big screens. Acting and writing was great as well as the sounding. It has great comedy as it has made it my favourite genre. I can say it was way better than the first movie,Jumanji - The Next Level
