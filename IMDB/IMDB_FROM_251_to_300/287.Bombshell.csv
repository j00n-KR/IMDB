0,SnoopyStyle,one out of three,7,14 March 2020,"It's 2015 at Fox News headed by Roger Ailes (John Lithgow). Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) is the star prime time anchor. Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) feels that she's being pushed aside. Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) is her ambitious corporate climbing producer.This is not a movie I'm itching to see. I'm not particularly interested in the inner workings of Fox News. Non of the characters are actually likeable. Gretchen annoys me. Roger is a sleaze as expected. Kayla and her gay friend Jess are not that interesting to me. I don't feel any sympathy for them. The only interesting character study is Megyn Kelly. She has a fascinating journey and her investigating the sexual harassment could have been thrilling. I want more of her family especially her relationship with her husband. It would have been nice to see some of her legal work. She needs to be more than Miss America and a female dog. Her actual personal life is what humanizes her. It would be intriguing to have her as the sole main character. Quite frankly, reducing this to a study of Gretchen and Megyn would be enough to raise the personal power of the characterizations.",Bombshell
1,Prismark10,Bombshell,5,21 January 2020,"Based on true events. This film based on sexism within the upper echelons of Fox News had to fictionalise the truth. So very Fox News!Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) takes on the head of Fox News Roger Ailes (John Lithgow.) She is eventually aided in her perilous journey by fellow host Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) and Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie.)Ailes was a Conservative media consultant for Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush Sr. He effectively kickstarted Fox news and was close to owner Rupert Murdoch.Bombshell has to set up a battle between the women and a giant of the Conservative news media. This includes massaging the female characters to make them appear nicer.Megyn Kelly's history of racism is erased and the focus is her taking on Trump's perceived sexism. Kayla Pospisil on the other hand is an invented Christian Conservative character.Bombshell wants the audience to sympathise with people when if the shoe was on a working class woman or a black man taking on the establishment. They would be labelled as snowflakes by the same people.These people just did not take the Fox news shilling, they took on its values of being a right wing propaganda mouthpiece. There is a falseness to this movie. I could not help thinking that Carlson's stance was little to do with female empowerment but revenge for being demoted.",Bombshell
2,claudio_carvalho,Power and Ambition,5,28 June 2020,"I read the news about the Fox News Roger Alles and his sexual harassment in my country in the past; therefore, I do not know details of this scandal. Further, I am not right wing. However, based on this shallow and sensationalist movie, it seems that the reporters and anchors are only opportunists looking for money from the tribunal. They were looking for better position in Fox News when they were unknown to the audiences and could have left the corporation without any sexual damage. Nobody is forced to be submitted to the boss in your employment. Go to the court years after when you are a decadent anchor seems to be opportunism to make easy money in these politically correct times. The makeup is top-notch. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""O Escândalo"" (""The Scandal"")",Bombshell
3,nogodnomasters,There's not an audience for that side of the story,10,29 December 2019,"Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) made women rich and famous at Fox News. He didn't see the harm in ""demanding loyalty."" Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) was terminated for not submitting to Roger and filed a personal lawsuit against him and not against Fox. She stood alone. No one would come to her aid and say ""Me Too."" Meanwhile, Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) had to make a career and monetary decision. Roger did not stand by her when Trump attacked her. The loyalty didn't work both ways. Payback is a b*tch. She decided that you can't be wrong to stand on the side of truth. And we know what happened to her career.I learned some interesting facts. Roger Ailes was such a disgusting pig, his parents ran away from home. Then there was, ""You can leave Fox, but Fox can't leave you."" This refers to the stigmatism that no one will hire ex-Fox employees so they are stuck at Fox and have to suffer the indignities placed upon them in their white male-dominated world where women are ratings bait. And most importantly I learned that ""Sushi is not liberal food.""I loved the film. Margot Robbie demonstrates she can play a very sensitive woman as well as Harley Quinn. Kidman and Theron were great. I hope the liberals in Hollywood gives it 11 Oscars. They can skimp on the soundtrack.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Bombshell
4,kosmasp,One side,8,6 June 2020,"While this plays at Faux News ... well some may still refer to them as Fox News I reckon, but let's stick with the overall picture they are sending and propagating themeselves. Faux and Friends and others are pawns to serve certain interests ... in their mind they balance something out. They don't, they ""report"" lies. But I am getting ahead of myself and will be getting negative marks from those actually believing the stuff that TV station is spewing.For all the others who remained here (thanks for your patience and hooray for thinking for yourself), this is the story of how many women got sexually harassed and had to do demeaning stuff to promote themselves and to get ahead in their career (no pun intended at all). While most of it is taken from a book from a former employer there, we can assume that most things actually happen the way they are described.We can also safely assume that there are more players that should have been arrested or fined at least. That behaviour was approved or at least allowed to happen ... a working climate that is toxic to say the least. Something the movie conveys quite nicely ... and makes it an uneasy watch therefor ...",Bombshell
5,Sleepin_Dragon,An interesting story.,7,22 January 2021,"We have been in a.period of change for some time, and it has taken some very brave women to stand up, make a stand and say enough is enough.I watched this a few days ago, and borrowed it from a friend, who happens to be a feminist, she surprisingly didn't like it, stating that she felt they had added too much to the story to make it a little sensational, thus demeaning the film.Personally I quite liked it, an interesting, relevant story of course, the acting on the whole was pretty good, I thought Theron was the standout.It's definitely not a movie I would ever want to watch again, but I thought it was pretty good. 7/10.",Bombshell
6,classicsoncall,"""I'm discreet, but unforgiving.""",7,28 January 2020,"I won't defend Roger Ailes or Bill O'Reilly for their treatment of women, and if they got what was coming to them, so much the better. But the film serves just as much as a hit job on Fox News as it does in service to the women who brought personal suit against Ailes. Regular viewers of the cable station will recognize a plethora of on-air names associated with the company, and it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to state that the actors who portrayed Geraldo Rivera, Sean Hannity and Rudy Giuliani were selected for their ability to caricature the personalities. John Lithgow was unrecognizable as Roger Ailes, while the women in the spotlight were capably portrayed by Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly, and Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson. I actually had to do a double take when I saw Kevin Dorff in the role of Bill O'Reilley; I thought for a moment O'Reilley was actually in the film, outlandish as that might have been. Margot Robbie portrayed a name I wasn't familiar with, and as it turns out, Kayla Pospisil was a composite character, which didn't seem all that necessary given the scope of the story and what the principals were trying to accomplish. Theron and Robbie have both received Oscar nominations in their respective categories, but if the picture has any chance at all when the Academy votes, it will be for Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling.",Bombshell
7,lee_eisenberg,"in a world of MeToo, this becomes all the more important",10,29 November 2020,"In 2016, Fox News commentator Gretchen Carlson accused CEO Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her. Anchorwoman Megyn Kelly soon followed suit, and Ailes resigned. Jay Roach's ""Bombshell"" looks at this story, and what goes on behind the scenes at Fox News. Anyone who cares about serious journalism already viewed the channel as an insult to journalism. As the movie makes clear, Ailes cared only about showing off young blonde women in skimpy dresses.John Lithgow (Ailes), Charlize Theron (Kelly), Nicole Kidman (Carlson) and Margot Robbie (a fictional character) really get into their roles, thanks to the Academy Award-winning makeup. Obviously I can't verify the accuracy of the story. At the very least, it shows what Rupert Murdoch's dominance of the media has created. I'm sure that these sorts of things happened before he lorded over the press, but his dominance made it OK, if not a recommendation.I don't know how much is going to change in the post-MeToo world, whether in the media, politics, entertainment or tech. Just as long as we realize that there's nothing wholesome about the halls of power. Definitely see it.",Bombshell
8,jboothmillard,Bombshell,7,26 January 2020,"I saw the trailer for this movie about a month before its release, I was already interested because of the impressive cast and it looked like an interesting fact-based story, then of course the Awards Season attention it was receiving made me more keen, directed by Jay Roach (Austin Powers, Meet the Parents, Trumbo). Based on the true story, set in 2016, it is about a group of women who take on Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) and the toxic atmosphere he presided over at the Fox News network. Megyn Kelly (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Charlize Theron) is one of the most popular newscasters and is presenting during the 2016 Republican debate. The day of the debate, despite being sick and vomiting, Megyn questions Donald Trump on comments he has made about women. In retaliation, Trump tweets insults about her, and others follow suit. Megyn, and her husband Douglas Brunt (Mark Duplass), also have to deal with intruders, including photographers, at their home. Ailes worries that someone poisoned Megyn the day of the debate, so Fox hires a security detail for her. Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) was a co-anchor of the popular Fox and Friends, until she is removed and is transferred to a less popular show. Inundated by sexist comments on and off the air, she meets with lawyers who tell her how Rudi Bakhtiar (Nazanin Boniadi) was fired after accusing Ailes of sexual harassment. They plan to file a harassment suit against Ailes but tell Carlson she'll need evidence and testimony from other women. Kayla Pospisil (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Margot Robbie) is Fox's newest recruit, working with Carlson, but soon accepts a job on The O'Reilly Factor. Bill O'Reilly (Kevin Dorff) fires her that first day, and she gets drunk and sleeps with her Fox co-worker Jess Carr (Kate McKinnon). When they wake up, Kayla says she's not a lesbian. Jess admits to being liberal, after Kayla sees a poster of Hillary Clinton, she says she applied for many jobs, but Fox hired her, and now no one else will. Kayla is later invited into Ailes' office, where he makes her lift her skirt to show him her underwear. She tells Jess, who says she can't get involved. Gretchen reveals on air that she supports the assault weapons ban, prompting Ailes to summon her. She is fired and is given no clear reason why. She decides to sue Ailes for sexual harassment. Ailes meets with his wife, Beth (Connie Britton), and attorneys Susan Estrich (Allison Janney) and Rudy Giuliani (Richard Kind), denying the allegations. All female staffers are asked to stand with Fox, while most do, Megyn does not come forward. When the suit is filed, no other women come forward. Gretchen's expectations are dashed, and viewers turn on her. Megyn finds other women, including Kayla, who were sexually harassed by Ailes or O'Reilly. Kayla says she obeyed Ailes to protect her career, and felt ashamed, but now wants to come forward. Megyn speaks up and learns that 22 other women will also speak. Estrich tells Ailes that Gretchen has recorded conversations that will win the case. Ailes meets with Fox co-creator Rupert Murdoch (Malcolm McDowell), who tells him he will be fired. Ailes asks to break that news, but Murdoch refuses. Murdoch announces he is taking over Fox, but Jess refuses to speak up. Kayla, knowing she would be fired, quits instead. Meanwhile, Megyn is given $20 million in damages and an apology from Fox but cannot speak about her case. Megyn tells viewers that she does not care if they like her, only that they believe her. Also starring Rob Delaney as Gil Norman, Stephen Root as Neil Mullen, Liv Hewson as Lily Balin, Brigette Lundy-Paine as Julia Clarke, Alice Eve as Ainsley Earhardt, Alanna Ubach as Judge Jeanine Pirro, Jennifer Morrison as Juliet Huddy, Anne Ramsay as Greta Van Susteren, House's Jennifer Morrison as Juliet Huddy, Twilight's Ashley Greene as Abby Huntsman, Final Destination 5's P.J. Byrne as Neil Cavuto, Ugly Betty's Tony Plana as Geraldo Rivera and Brian d'Arcy James as Brian Wilson. An almost unrecognisable Theron is fantastic as the gutsy female journalist, Robbie is also great as the fictional but believably emotional office worker, Kidman does very well as the determined fellow broadcaster, and Lithgow is suitably creepy as the devious CEO. With the recent Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations going on, this film was released at the right time, showing the downfall of a man at the top, taken down by the women he disgustingly took advantage of. The main plot of the film is obvious, but it also cleverly satirises the workplace etiquette and corporate environments, occasionally breaks the fourth wall, and has superb makeup to transform the great cast, a most watchable biographical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair. Very good!",Bombshell
9,BA_Harrison,You were bored stiff? #MeToo,1,7 January 2020,"It goes without saying that it is disgusting when men in power abuse their position by taking advantage of women in a sexual manner, but who the hell thought that the Fox News scandal would make for a compelling movie? Never has 109 minutes seemed so long. Director Jay Roach, so good at goofball comedy, bored my socks off with this dreary feminist drama that moves slowly and uneventfully towards its inevitable damp squib of a climax (when sex-pest Roger Ailes gets what's coming to him -- a $40 million settlement from Rupert Murdoch).It's extremely telling that the thing I found most engrossing about the whole film was trying to decide whether Nicole Kidman's chin was a prosthetic or some monstrous plastic surgery procedure gone horribly wrong. I'm still undecided about that, but I am sure that I will never watch this film again (unless someone wants to pay me $40 million to do so).",Bombshell
10,blanche-2,story of the takedown of Roger Ailes,7,5 January 2020,"I won't write too much because it doesn't seem to me that anyone is reviewing this film. If you're right wing, you don't like it and will condemn any review that compliments it, and vice versa.I thought the acting was terrific but I have to agree with one reviewer here, the real story was about Gretchen Carlson, and there was less emphasis on her and more on Megyn Kelly. Carlson is the one who really put herself out there.I haven't seen the film others are comparing this to, ""The Loudest Voice,"" but I would be interested in seeing it.",Bombshell
11,BandSAboutMovies,How real?,5,7 February 2020,"Jay Roach has split his career between comedies - Austin Powers, Dinner for Schmucks, Meet the Parents - with politics - Recount, Game Change, Trumbo, All the Way - and even The Campaign and this film, two movies that try to straddle the line. (He made his directing debut with the 1990 Porkys/Animal House inspired comedy Zoo Radio.)Working from a script by Charles Randolph (The Life of David Gale, The Interpreter, Love & Other Drugs, The Big Short), this time Roach tackles the #metoo movement from a place that the left side may not want to acknowledge: inside Fox News.Concentrating on the stories of Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie), Bombshell shows how each of their lives intersected with the head of Fox News, Roger Ailes (John Lithgow). The film blurs the lines between real life and movie magic by sometimes using real footage - particularly as Donald Trump clashes with Kelly.While that media storm is blowing, Carlson is booted as co-anchor of the popular Fox and Friends show. She then meets with lawyers who tell her that she could file suit against Ailes, but would need other women to come forward.Pospisil is a new hire who works for Carlson and then Bill O'Reilly (Kevin Dorff, who often appeared on Conan O'Brien's shows) before he fires her. That night, she sleeps with Jess Carr (Kate McKinnon), who is a closeted lesbian who works for the channel. Neither of these characters - in the mass of real people whose real lives are on display - are based on anyone real, but instead serve as straw people, amalgams of the various anonymous testimonies against Ailes. It's strange, when Pospisil easily falls in bed with Carr, despite constantly proclaiming her Christian upbringing. I realize this isn't a documentary, but at this point, you should realize that the story is skewed.Then again, are Kayla and Carr just the voices of the voiceless? As the composite characters made up of interviews the producers did with former staffers, as well as anonymous testimony, are they any less real for not being actual people?Randolph told USA Today, ""What happens inside of Roger's office is based on the stories of three women we had access to. Her being ideologically fervent like a dedicated Republican, but a little sexually fluid and utterly morally sincere, that's based more on women in my life.""In a harrowing scene, Pospisil later is invited to Ailes' office, where he continually makes her lift her skirt higher, despite seeming to show no real attention or care to who she is, what she's doing or what she's saying. Sex - and the power given by it - is just a casual transaction.After Carlson supports the assault weapons ban on air, Ailes fires her, which allows her to launch her suit. All female staffers are asked to stand in lockstep with Fox, but Kelly refuses. Soon, twenty-two other women - and recorded conversations - push the cable news titan out of power.So was Kelly a hero? Was her need to speak up heroic? Perhaps not so, according to As Ailes biographer Gabriel Sherman, who wrote in New York Magazine: ""Carlson's lawsuit presented an opportunity. Kelly could bust up the boys' club at Fox, put herself on the right side of a snowballing media story, and rid herself of a boss who was no longer supportive of her-all while maximizing her leverage in a contract negotiation.""Carlson really did record every conversation with Ailes for an entire year, as she'd been planning to sue him for some time. The damning line, ""I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago"" is 100% accurate, as is the $20 million she received.Malcolm McDowell plays mogul Rupert Murdoch, and his sons, James and Lachlan, are played by Australia brothers Josh and Ben Lawson - who are much more attractive than the real-life Murdoch boys. However, the gay slur that Ailes levies against James and his post 9-11 breakdown over anthrax are both accurate, according to this Slate article.Bombshell is packed with great actors in small roles, like Connie Britton (Friday Night Lights) as Beth Ailes, Rob Delaney as a producer, Mark Duplass (The League) as Kelly's husband, Allison Janney as Ailes' legal consultant Susan Estrich, Katie Aselton (who was also on The League), Nazanin Boniadi as Rudi Bakhtiar (the first person who tried to sue Ailes), Liv Hewson (Santa Clarita Diet) as a staffer, Andy Buckley (David Wallace from The Office), P.

Byrne as Neil Cavuto, Bree Condon as The Five host Kimberly Guilfoyle, Alice Eve as Fox and Friends host Ainsley Earhardt, Spencer Garrett as Sean Hannity, Ashley Greene (Ashley Cullen from the Twilight films) as Abby Huntsman, Tricia Helfer (Cylon Number Six!) as Alisyn Camerota, Marc Evan Jackson as Chris Wallace, Marc Evan Jackson as Fox anchor Chris Wallace, Mad About You's Richard Kind as Rudy Giuliani, Mark Moses(Desperate Housewives) as Bill Shine, Jennifer Morrison (TV's House) as Juliet Huddy, Ahna O'Reilly (The Help) as Julie Roginsky, Tony Plana as a kinda sorta recognziable Geraldo Rivera, Lisa Canning as Outnumbered host Harris Faulkner, Elisabeth Rohm (Angel, Law and Order) as Martha MacCallum, Stephen Root (an unheralded acting master, who is in everything from NewsRadio to King of the Hill, Office Space and even Monkey Shines) as Neil Mullen, Brooke Smith (Catherine in The Silence of the Lambs) as Irena Briganti., Holland Taylor (the mom from Two and a Half Men) as Ailes enabling assistant Faye, John Rothman as Martin Hyman, Alanna Ubach as Jeanine Pirro, Robin Weigert as Nancy Smith, Madeline Zima as Edie and Anne Ramsay (Lisa Stemple from Mad About You) as Greta Van Susteren. Whew! Did I miss anybody?In January of this year, Kelly posted a 30-minute roundtable with her, Huddy, Bakhtiar, Brunt and former Fox News producer Julie Zann about this movie. It confirmed many details in the film, such as the spin that Ailes would request. The consensus was that the movie let him off easy and that the scene where Pospisil yells at Kelly for not speaking up was a victim-blaming scene written by a man. That said, she did admit that she could have done more.",Bombshell

It presents interesting true-to-life lead characters such as Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly.No question that the movie has a great cast.Acting performances are wonderful. The Oscar nominations taken by Theron and Robbie are a testament to that. Speaking of Academy Awards, credit must be given to it for it won Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling. Unfortunately, the story is lacking.Speaking of the story, it was definitely in need of tension and sensationalism as it just goes through the motions. The sexual harassment scene with fictional character Kayla Pospisil with Ailes was definitely lacking as the mood and emotions it created just makes it an ordinary scene just like the others. The viewer would probably feel nothing in it. As for Megyn Kelly's character is portrayed,her scenes felt more of a compilation of montages rather than providing an analysis of her character.If you want a better knowledge and a better film about about Fox News, the Russell Crowe and Naomi Watts TV mini-series ""The Loudest Voice"" is a better option.",Bombshell
14,CinemaSerf,Strong story about strong women...,7,27 January 2020,"Charlize Theron is very good leading this recounting of the tale of the downfall of Roger Ailes (played here by a superbly creepy John Lithgow) at the US network Fox News. A skilful Nicole Kidman portrays ""Gretchen Carlson"" who is fired from her anchor job at the network and who sues her former boss for sexual harassment. With another decent - though not outstanding - performance from Margot Robbie the three women take on not just the boss, but an entire establishment that is initially dismissive of their allegations. The film does really rely on a little knowledge of the story and the personalities in advance (Malcolm McDowell pops up as Rupert Murdoch) because the script is nothing special nor is Jay Roach's direction.",Bombshell
15,writers_reign,Anyone in UK give two Fox?,7,18 January 2020,"It will be interesting to see if this very American factual story attracts a UK audience. I myself have a lifelong interest in Americana and am arguably more aware of people like, for example, Huey Long, assassinated in 1935 and the subject of at least two novels, A Lion Is In The Streets and All The King's Men, both subsequently filmed with the latter winning a Best Actor Oscar for Broderick Crawford. Although the former starred James Cagney as the fictionalized Long I doubt very much whether Uk audiences cared either way about the actual events - both novels were roman a clefsa i.e employing fictional characters based squarely and obviously on real people. In the case of Bombshell the people - executives and newreaders at Fox news - are real people and in addition the events portrayed are barely four years old, set as they are, against the presidential election that took Donald Trump into the White House. Ironically similar disclosures one year later involving Harvey Weinstein and sexual harassment completely eclipsed those depicted here surrounding Roger Ailes. The acting is first rate and if UK viewers ARE able to work up a sweat about the facts they cannot but enjoy this movie.",Bombshell
16,grantss,"Good, and surprisingly so",7,28 June 2020,"July 2016. Gretchen Carlson was once one of the most popular presenters on Fox News but now has been relegated to minor timeslot. She is considering suing Fox News CEO Roger Ailes for sexual harassment and when she is let go by Fox, she does so. She tries to get other women to come forward but gains little traction. Megyn Kelly, another Fox reporter, has her own secrets regarding Ailes but is not sure whether she should come forward. Kayla, a junior reporter, has more recent experiences of the matter.I set my expectations quite low, figuring it was just going to be a left-wing hatchet job. Not that that I'm a supporter of Fox News, far from it. (I hate every media organisation equally. That's my kind of fair and balanced). No, it just would have been too one-dimensional and predictable.To my surprise, director Jay Roach has crafted a reasonably balanced view of the Gretchen Karlson-Roger Ailes saga. His past credits would have given an indication of his ability to tackle a politically-charged subject and yet present it an even-handed fashion and engage a wide audience. He directed Recount (2008), covering the 2000 US election, Game Change (2012), covering the Vice Presidential candidacy of Sarah Palin, Trumbo (2015), the biopic on the blacklisted McCarthy-era writer and All the Way (2016), covering President Lyndon Johnson's struggles to have the Civil Rights Act passed. All of these are excellent films.Once again Roach takes us on an engaging, evolving journey without becoming too biased in the process. In the beginning Ailes is even painted in a reasonably non-negative light, as a tough but fair, hugely successful, businessman who stands by his employees. Starting from a position of neutrality means you don't have any biases as the plot develops.Roach's deft direction is helped by a star-studded cast that delivers in spades. Great work from Charlize Theron (as Megyn Kelly), Nicole Kidman (as Gretchen Carlson), Margot Robbie (as Kayla) and John Lithgow (as Roger Ailes) in the main roles. Theron got a Best Actress Oscar nomination and Robbie a Best Supporting Actress nomination for their efforts. The remaining cast, which includes Alison Janney, Malcolm McDowell (as Rupert Murdoch), Connie Britton and Stephen Root, don't put a foot wrong.",Bombshell
17,evanston_dad,Surprisingly Entertaining,7,20 July 2020,"Despite a couple of Oscar nominations for acting, ""Bombshell"" was greeted pretty indifferently by audiences and critics alike when it came out last year. Perhaps it was due to my low expectations, then, but I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. It's slick and glib and fairly superficial, but it's extremely watchable and very entertaining, and the acting is indeed exceptional. Charlize Theron and Margot Robbie were singled out for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress nominations, respectively. But I was as impressed with Nicole Kidman and John Lithgow.In this tale of women coming out against sexual harassment, ""Bombshell"" conveniently sidesteps the fact that these particular women were contributing to an atmosphere of male toxicity by peddling Fox News' message in the first place. But to address that would have been to make the entire screenplay more complex, and it would have interfered with the filmmakers' wish to portray these women as unequivocal heroes of the MeToo Movement.The makeup crew for this film worked over time to transform attractive Hollywood actors and actresses into already attractive people like Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson, and not so attractive people like Roger Ailes and a spot-on Bill O'Reilly, and won an Oscar for their efforts.Grade: B+",Bombshell
18,ferguson-6,despicable him,6,19 December 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Movies based on true stories are increasingly popular these days. OK, not as popular as comic book films, but the appeal of tapping into 'truth-is-stranger-than-fiction"" is a natural, as viewers bring a sense of familiarity to the characters and/or events. On the flipside, this familiarity can create challenges for the filmmakers and actors as they must meet viewer expectations or risk being waved off as a flop. When tackling the story of Fox News CEO Roger Ailes and the sexual harassment scandal of 2016, the folks associated with this project faced the added burden of an internationally reported story with faces and personalities recognized around the globe.For the most part, director Jay Roach (TRUMBO, MEET THE PARENTS, AUSTIN POWERS), screenwriter Charles Randolph (Oscar winner THE BIG SHORT), and a very talented cast succeed in taking us behind the scenes of this unsettling story, so that we might better understand how 20 years of despicable behavior continued unabated. The film picks up in 2015 as the Presidential campaigns are underway. Megyn Kelly (a spot-on performance from Oscar winner Charlize Theron) breaks the 4th wall and takes us on a tour of the Fox offices - even pointing out Roger Ailes' private and secure sanctuary. We then see the memorable moment where Ms. Kelly publicly questioned candidate Donald Trump about his history with women. It was a moment that shook the network, and elevated Megyn Kelly to worldwide notoriety.Early emphasis is on Gretchen Carlson (played by Oscar winner Nicole Kidman), and her declining role at the network as she is removed from the highly rated ""Fox and Friends"", and placed on her own show in an unappealing time slot. Although her professional skills are presented in a way that has her appearing a bit amateurish, Ms. Carlson makes the case that she was unceremoniously removed due to her not going along with Ailes' wishes behind closed doors. It's Gretchen Carlson's lawsuit against Ailes that kicks off the downfall of the network's leader. She was the one courageous enough to be first.Margot Robbie plays Kayla Pospisill, an ambitious producer who initially works for Carlson, and then moves on to ""The O'Reilly Factor"". Kayla is a composite character written to represent many of the women who worked at the network. She is smart and working towards a shot at becoming an on-air personality. It's that ambition that results in her sitting in Ailes' office when he says ""Stand up and give me a twirl."" His request (evidently not an uncommon one) is followed by his reasoning - ""Television is a visual medium."" It's Kayla's interaction that allows us a glimpse at the systemic sexual harassment that became commonplace in the office. The toxic environment was not isolated to Ailes ... as shown here, and proven later.John Lithgow perfectly captures the elderly Ailes, who suffers from multiple physical ailments - none of which affect his ego or demented nature. He never sees the evil of his ways, as he's been taking advantage of his power position for so long, the right comebacks and lead-ons have become second nature to him. What makes this even more frightening is that Ailes apparently used this harassment and manipulation as the first step in a form of mind control ... to ensure the content of his network fit his ultra-conservative and closed-minded ideals. The message was clear: remain loyal to him or lose your career.The ensemble cast is excellent, even if the leads dominate the story. Oscar winner Allison Janney portrays Ailes' attorney Susan Esrcih, Connie Brittain plays his supportive wife Beth Ailes, Malcom McDowell is Rupert Murdoch, and Kate McKinnon plays Kayla's co-worker (and more) Jess Carr, who is forced to keep her private life in her desk drawer. Other supporting roles are filled by Liv Hewson, Brigette Lundy-Paine, Rob Delaney, Mark Duplass, Stephen Root, Robin Weigert, Anne Ramsay, and Richard Kind. Some of the real life names and faces include: Bill O'Reilly, Rudy Giuliani, Chris Wallace, Greta Van Susteren, Neil Cavuto, Geraldo Rivera, and Jeanine Pirro.""This place is crazy."" I don't remember which character said it, but it could have been any of them. The politics of the network (and Ailes himself) are always hovering over every scene. What caused Fox News to become such a toxic work environment? Having a despicable leader doesn't seem like enough. Why were so many men treating it as a frat house, and so few women willing to speak up? The answer seems to be that these were talented and ambitious women who were determined not to lose what they had worked for. When one character states that women owe it to each other to speak up, it really brings into focus how much courage is required to do just that.Showtime's multiple-episode ""The Loudest Voice"" with Russell Crowe as Roger Ailes and Naomi Watts as Gretchen Carlson was able to go into greater depth with the longer run time, but director Roach tells this from the women's viewpoint. Ms. Theron truly disappears into the role of Megyn Kelly, while Lithgow, Kidman and Robbie deliver in a way that we forget we are watching actors. Some of the best segments feature these women reacting in the moment ... moments we hope are becoming extinct. By the way, I wonder how much a ""Team Roger"" t-shirt is going for these days - or if they can even give them away?",Bombshell
19,phd_travel,Shows the difficulty bringing up harassment,9,11 January 2020,"The ""Loudest Voice in the Room"" shows the creation and influence of Fox News and Roger Ailes role and downfall. ""Bombshell"" concentrated on the sexual harassment suit. There are some similarities and some differences. I suggest to watch them both. Bombshell shows things from Megyn Kelly's point of view and from Gretchen Carlson. Loudest is only Carlson. So it is worth watching both. There are some differences and some similarities.Bombshell shows how hard it was for Megyn to come forward. And all the things she had to consider after her clash with Trump. Quite illuminating to see her dilemma. Charlize gives a good imitation of Megyn's voice and sometimes looks a lot like her but sometimes harsher. Nicole has a smaller role. She doesn't look much like Gretchen. Margot Robbie is moving as a composite victim of harassment. Look out for other Fox stars like Judge Jeannine portrayed in Bombshell. Kate McKinnon's character was unnecessary.Worth watching.",Bombshell
20,gradyharp,'He's about as flirty as the grizzly from The Revenant',8,16 March 2020,"It takes courage to place this true story before the public at this time of the political climate during debates by presidential candidates and retorts from the sitting president who is famous for his association with Fox News. Charles Randolph (The Big Short, and The Life of David Gale) has written a penetrating screenplay about the 2016 explosion when Fox News persona Roger Ailes was finally exposed for sexual harassment by some courageous women. Director Jay Roach (Trumbo, Blown Away, Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery, etc) makes this story come vividly to life, unafraid to insert film clips of Donald Trump's appearances as the case unfolds, as well as including the lesbian relationships that give the story a new grounding.The story of this Fox News scandal is true, so everyone knows the outline. As one distillation states, 'When Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) slaps Fox News founder Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) with a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, not a soul could predict what would happen next. Her decision leads to Fox News correspondent Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) coming forward with her own story, as well as multiple other women, such as Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie), inciting a movement that reverberates around the world.'The cast is outstanding: Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, and Margot Robbie each excel, but the other women in the film - Allison Janney, Connie Britton, Liv Hewson, Kate McKinnon, and Brigette Lundy-Paine - also impress. John Lithgow is very appropriately repugnant as Roger Ailes, as is Malcolm McDowell as Rupert Murdoch, and the clips of Giuliani, Trump et al. The tension never lets up as this scandal is related in fine form. Not only is the film excellent (though some may prefer the Showtime series THE LOUDEST VOICE account of the scandal), but also it offers award winning quality performances that allow the actors to step into different territories.",Bombshell
21,deloudelouvain,"Disgusting people in a disgusting network, why am I not surprised by the outcome?",8,19 January 2021,"In all fairness I wasn't expecting much from this movie. Fox isn't a channel I would ever watch if I lived in America as to me they're just biased and too conservative, which after watching the movie only confirms my thoughts about it. The scandal was the thing I was interested in as even in Europe it was headnews when it came out. For a biography, based on true events, it was a good movie, and that mostly due to the excellent acting from the whole cast. John Lithgow, Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie and the others did a terrific job playing their characters. As for the story, it's one of those that makes you angry, that is if you're a normal person with the right values. Not really a movie for Republicans though, as you see they just condone that kind of disgusting behavior. Voting for a disgusting sexist pig like Trump is just outrageous, I will never get why any woman would ever vote for a guy like that, it's beyond my comprehension. Although the big boss of Fox is a sexual predator I can't agree with any of the harassed women's behavior either, they did anything to keep their precious job. No job is good enough to put up with that kind of harrasement, so to me they're also faulty, just by shutting up about it for so long and so making other women vulnerable for that repetitive sexual deviant behaviour. Bombshell won an Oscar for Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling, not really a thing I put any value to, although John Litgows transformation was pretty good. In conclusion Bombshell is a good movie, it will make you angry, it will make you think why a guy rich powerful guy can get away with this and on top of that getting 65 millions of compensation. If any other ""normal"" human being would do this he would go straight to jail for years. I guess there's a law for the rich and another for the poor, like usual.",Bombshell
22,siderite,Hard to go one way or the other... kind of like the women in the film,8,1 March 2020,"Did I like it? Yes. The story was also important, the acting was good, the makeup and sets were on point. But it felt like a TV movie with a stellar cast. Most of the people you see in that cast had seconds of screen time. The plot itself read like a documentary or a live news report rather than a narrative. You understand the plight of the women in the movie indirectly, via face expressions, the occasional emotional outburst, quickly reigned in. It is both powerful and a bit boring.
In the end the film tells the story, but makes it really hard to empathise with any of the characters, who are hardly fleshed out.
Bottom line: take the time to read the cast, to see how many famous actors and actresses basically cameoed in this film to show their support. But it was only that, a tip of the hat to a story that had to be said. Then they did Birds of Prey and Terminator.",Bombshell
23,blanbrn,"Did you hear Roger say I would like to see you in some sexy colored bras!? Brash, Provocative, bold bio like look at the downfall of power by a revealing sexy me too movement.",9,5 January 2020,"Everyone who follows news and headlines and political stories knows about the tales and supposed happenings at the ""FOX News Channel"". No matter your political stance or leanings if you've ever watched the channel over the years you've clearly seen that most all of the female news anchors and reporters were hot and very sexy really some eye candy for any viewer. This picture from director Jay Roach in which I describe somewhat drama, dark comedy, bio type is one revealing brash sexy look at an atmosphere and culture of a good old boys club and how their leader the powerful Roger Ailes(John Lithgow) conducted dirty laundry type business with his female employees behind closed doors.The focus and wild card players here are top news anchors and reporters Megyn Kelly(in a fine and near real look alike performance from Charlize Theron) and Gretchen Carlson(Nicole Kidman) who after years of apparent sexual harassment blow the lead off of his powerful company. As it was exposed the network was a toxic culture for most all of it's female employees. Most catching is seeing Kayla(the sexy Margot Robbie I love her in that sexy black strapless bra scene) a fictional composite character which was inspired by many of Roger's supposed accusers, as Kayla is the poster girl and foot solider employee one who marches along with the network's message of values, faith, morals, and right wing politics only she's soon exposed to the backroom advances of sexual misconduct.Thru the film it's filled with much drama and fun black heart like humor like scenes of ""FOX"" News employees in meetings and spotlighted is Kelly's war of words with Trump during his 2016 presidential run. And the scenes of Roger in his office with females is certainly interesting and really a spin for four play and get under the sheets advances. The film is also revealing especially when you see the scene when it swoops in on the chatter and showcased chaos of the ladies' wardrobe room at ""Fox News"" it's clear that all are news Barbies and sexy colored bra wearing ladies. This was the way that big Rog wanted it as good looks shined and made his network a media ratings darling, as all viewers saw the eye candy of lady anchors and reporters in short skirts.Aside from that this movie is a wake up call for women as each lead character finally has the courage and voice to speak and fight power and get moral justice as this was just another step that would help power the ""Me Too Movement"". As it's footage and real news reports takes you the viewer back to these tense and groundbreaking times of scandal and downfall. The chemistry and performances from the cast is all pro and in top notch form from Lithgow, Kidman, Robbie, and Theron as they each feed off each one's emotions and story. The style of the film is sexy, tabloid like he said she said still the big weapon is that all of the ladies use their world of mouth and collected stories from past supposed victims of Roger's to speak and bring truth to power as each had a right to do so as exposure and feeling compensated belonged to each of them.",Bombshell
24,FeastMode,didn't engage me,4,2 April 2020,"I hate to give this movie a bad rating but it just didn't do much for me. i completely support the message against sexual harassment and garbo fox news. but i'm generally not a fan of based on true story movies and this one had difficulty engaging me. it also angered me because i feel like not much has changed, fox news is still thriving and still horrible, and trump, who is the worst example of anti-women sentiment, is the president.but regardless of all that, i just didn't think it was a great movie overall. there wasn't much story. they seemed to pad the runtime with extra backstory for the characters, which can be a good thing, but doesn't replace story. you still need an intriguing story.the acting was fantastic. charlize is her usual beast self, and margot robbie continues to impress me. i no longer question if she's cast to be eye-candy, and i think she will be around for a long time (1 viewing, 3/31/2020)",Bombshell
25,Lejink,Fox Hunting,5,22 March 2020,"There's certainly an important story to be to!d about the sexual harassment of women in American business, especially, it would appear, in the visual arts. We've recently seen Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein jailed for his abuse of a number of women over whose careers he had varying measures of control. No doubt a movie of his dramatic fall from grace is waiting in the wings, perhaps when he too isn't around anymore.Here, a similar story is told of another obese, physically repulsive but massively powerful and influential media man, Fox News's Roger Ailes exploiting his position to solicit young women seeking a career in television. Two high-profile blonde (hence the name of the movie I guess) news-anchors, Gretchen Karlsen and Megyn Kelly, both working for the right-leaning network eventually came forward separately to accuse Ailes of harassing them, in the end forcing his resignation, that came to foreshadow the ""#MeToo"" movement which crystalised around Weinstein's slightly later case.Kelly herself came to particular prominence when Trump made his despicable comments about her ""anger-menstruating"" when questioning him about previous comments of his about women, which item is mentioned in the film, arguably perhaps attempting to complete a sordid triangle in the process. Karlsen however would appear to have been the main driver against Ailes's abuses with her law-suit against him, with Kelly apparently waiting until she saw evidence of Ailes still continuing the practice, especially with an ambitious new arrival to the network, a composite character improbably named Kayla Pospisil, before she too picks up the gauntlet and adds her telling voice to the accusations.I however felt that the use of a fictional character in such an important role deeply flawed the movie. Kayla's back-story, which involves her hooking up with a closet lesbian Liberal colleague seemed overly-contrived and wasted valuable screen time too. Ailes had many other accusers who get scant chance here to speak a few lines outlining their own degrading experiences with this man when surely one of their true stories could have replaced the unnecessary fiction.I found the pacing of the film distracting and also that there were far too many characters milling about in the background, sometimes given name-titles, sometimes not. I don't know how I felt either about Karlsen accepting a $20 million payment from Fox as contrition for Ailes conduct on condition that she sign a confidentiality clause or Kelly keeping quiet for so long before perceived career slights from above seemed to prompt her very belatedly into action. She too received a multi-million dollar settlement from the corporation and yet I found myself thinking of the no doubt thousands of other women probably compromised in far worse ways down the years who even if they won similar cases wouldn't have received a fraction of the sums paid over in these high-profile cases.As a film, it seemed to me to be underpowered and to lack narrative focus, unnecessarily blurring fact with fiction. Plus I didn't get a great deal from any of the actors even if some of the performances were Oscar nominated.From its clumsy title on down I felt this film could have dealt with this important topical subject in a tougher, more honest manner. Well meant as the final scene of Kayla's character walking out as Rupert Murdoch praises Ailes with faint damns, it obviously didn't happen and so pointed out the misguided artifice mistakenly used to further what was already a potent argument.",Bombshell
26,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Interesting, dynamic drama",9,30 January 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the run up to the presidential elections of 2016, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) lands herself in hot water by putting a compromising question to presidential nominee Trump. Meanwhile, fellow established female presenter Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) has found herself moved out of the prime time slot after being the first to go public with accusations of misconduct by network CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow.) And finally, promising new upstart Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) becomes the latest young woman to learn the hard way how you get ahead at the news station. Together, these three women came together to take down Ailes and his toxic culture.In liberal circles (and in pretty much any other place where good taste is valued) Fox News is rightly sneered at with contempt. Even on this side of the pond, the vulgarity and tackiness behind the brand is blatantly obvious, not to mention it's clear political bias towards the right. The American version of The Sun newspaper, basically. And so any film, in the present progressive climate, that aims to shine a bad light on the organisation can only be held in high regard. Even better if it taps into the 'female empowerment' movement doing the rounds at present. But Jay Roach's Bombshell proves to be more than engaging in it's own right.Ailes proved one of the first (deserved) high profile casualties of the MeToo movement, which came to attest the power of it's being. Women collectively coming together and speaking out about their experiences at the hands of powerful, influential men, and the misconduct rife at the heart of major institutions, opened everyone's eyes to what must have been going on for years but was never spoken about. Current hot property Robbie and established older heads Kidman and Theron deliver strong performances along with a (bulked up) Lithgow.Even if there is a slight tonal inconsistency, veering from a slick, stylish 'talking to the camera' drama, to a searing, pull no punches one, it's still an engaging, dynamic and relevant film that is well worth seeing. ****",Bombshell
27,MOscarbradley,Hugely entertaining and very pertinent.,8,23 January 2020,"Should any movie dealing with sexual harrassement be as enjoyable as Jay Roach's marvellous ""Bombshell""? Probably not, but this account of how a handful of women brought down the boss of Fox News. just by telling the truth, is a real treat. Of course, that may be because we all love a juicy story and this one is as juicy as they come or maybe it's because we all love seeing brilliant actors just acting brilliantly. Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie are three of the women involved while a prosthetically enhanced John Lithgow is equally good as Roger Ailes, a man who keeps insisting his anchor women show a lot of leg as television is a visual medium. Of course, it didn't stop there and, as we all know, Ailes isn't the only power-abusing bigwig to have his crimes exposed and, make no mistake, sexual harrassment is a crime.Of course, you could argue that ""Bombshell"" is just a little too pleased with itself and just a tad on the superficial side to really make an impact; after all, Roach did begin in comedy. Until the whole culture of patriarachy, of sexualization and of power games is tackled in depth and in the real world, movies like ""Bombshell"" will remain nothing more than first-class entertainment but at least it is entertaining and it is first-class and that is a nice step to be getting on with.",Bombshell
28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,An important movie with an important message.,8,19 January 2020,"'Bombshell (2019)' is lively but serious - much like one of its most obvious inspirations, 'The Big Short (2015)'. Beyond its fourth wall breaks, knowing narration and often upbeat tone is a potent drama that seems to cut to the heart of its focal situation. It portrays sexual harassment with the nuance it deserves; it conveys its shocking absurdity, imaginable cruelty and apathetic casualness. The film is firmly on the side of women, exploring the shame and self-doubt that comes when someone does something like this to you. It also does a great job in showing how men, and patriarchal power structures, manipulate women against one another, to the point that a 'whistleblower' will be branded a traitor by those closest to her. It's incredibly compelling stuff and it's often really emotionally resonant. By focusing on the internal workings of Fox News (a notoriously right-wing establishment), the piece posits that it isn't dealing with a political issue; it's dealing with a human one. This means that we care about people whose opinions we may not agree with, which is something that so often doesn't happen in real life. The fantastic, multi-faceted performances go a long way in making this possible. The overall affair is entertaining, frustrating, revealing and satisfying. It doesn't pull its punches, despite an unusually strong 'true story but some events have been invented' disclaimer which plays at the start of the picture, and it's all the better for it. It's an important movie with an important message. It's about time we saw something like this on the big screen. 8/10",Bombshell
29,dromasca,sexual harassment in the news room,7,5 February 2020,"The American presidential elections years are good opportunities for political films. Documentaries or fiction films released in these years have addressed different aspects of the political system, and the American and international audiences have extended their attention already alerted by the election campaigns that extend over the full year prior to the election to the related movies on the screens. It is still too early to say whether 2020 will bring more significant films in this category, but I believe I can point out that 'Bombshell' written by Charles Randolph and directed by Jay Roach, released on screen in December 2019, is one of the first of its kind this season. It could be objected that the film is not about politicians but about TV studios, but I think that the objection can be dismissed from start. Televisions have become an active participant in political games in the United States and other parts of the world - particularly news and commentary TV channels that broadcast 24 hours a day of politics such as Fox News. The story in 'Bombshell' is happening in the summer of 2016 and the American presidential election campaign that resulted in the election of Donald Trump as president is always in the background. But the main topic is the sexual harassment scandals that have been in the forefront of public attention since 2016 until today. The fall of Fox News' all-powerful programs director, Roger Ailes, was the first heavily publicized case of what would become the #MeToo movement starting with the spring of 2017.The script is trying to reconstruct as realistically and truthfully as possible the atmosphere and activities of the Fox News network in June and July 2016. Three characters, three women who all work at Fox, two of them real characters and well-known names for television fans (Megin Kelly played by Charlize Theron and Gretchen Carlson played by Nicole Kidman) and the third imaginary character (young reporter Kayla Pospisil - Margot Robbie) face the sexual advances of the all-powerful studio chief executive Roger Ailes (played by John Lithgow) within the sexist atmosphere and the corporate privacy rules that were protecting the powerful. Fox News did not invent news television as entertainment, but under Ailes's leadership, it had created a combination of conservative policy and use of attractive female presenters and journalists to increase audience and ratings. The mantra ""television is a visual media"" was hiding a sexist attitude and criteria for promoting those who received time on the network screens. When Carlson, fallen into disgrace and fired, decides to publicly disclose what is happening behind the scenes, the entire corporation puts in march its machinery to protect the business. The script follows the weeks in which Ailes' female victims gather their moral forces to overcome the personal traumas and the possible consequences for their careers, and publicly disclose, what happened to each one of them, joining the collective action.Can films like 'Bombshell' be judged and appreciated outside their political contexts? It ain't easy. This film is a mosaic of political fiction inspired by real events, mixing real and imaginary characters and the personal drama of women who want to build a career in television journalism and who are facing sexual harassment in a corporate atmosphere dominated by sexism, led and controlled by men. It is an American story of the 21st century, in which the lone heroes (women in this case) fight for justice, but their chances of success are real only if they join forces and collaborate with each other to win the battle with the system and to reveal the truth. Director Jay Roach who has directed several successful comedies over the last few decades (the 'Austin Powers' series or family comedies like 'Meet the Fockers') completely abandons the tools of humor for an alert docu-drama style that exactly mimics the style of the shows in the TV studios where the action takes place. The result is interesting to those who know Kelly, Carslon or O'Reilly, but I don't think it's always clear to those who are unfamiliar with Fox News and its anchors. The imaginary characters and the individual dramas of the women are the ones that captivated me, and the scene that confronts Margot Robbie's Kayla Pospisil with John Lithgow 's Roger Ailes was terrifying to me. Each of the women gets to enlist on her way and for her reasons in the fight with the system. 'Bombshell' masterfully uses makeup, and brings in two beautiful actresses, with well-known profiles, who have already played in other films roles in which they have been maked-up to the limits of not being recognized. Of the two of them I think Charlize Theron is the one who manages a great creation, melting into the role of Megin Kelly. Nicole Kidman's Carlson seemed to me a little stiff. The performance of John Lithgow, an actor I love and appreciate very much - also helped by a very successful makeup - was amazing. I will not skip mentioning the excellent Malcolm McDowell in the small but important role of Rupert Murdoch. 'Bombshell' has its ups and downs, it is a film that addresses a painful topic and I believe others will follow in its footsteps. Finally, it is a film that will leave few people indifferent, same as the Fox News programs.",Bombshell

32,Cineanalyst,"Partly Fair, Somewhat Balanced",6,18 March 2020,"I have no qualms with making a mockery of FoxNews and TV personalities masquerading as journalists, and ""Bombshell"" may be mildly amusing in this respect, but the irony and, perhaps, hypocrisy of the movie is that it, too, is largely enamored with these boob-tube stars. There's a scene here where photographs and voiceovers are provided for some of the other victims of sexual harassment at the hands of Roger Ailes, but, for the most part, the picture is preoccupied with Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly, as well as Margot Robbie as a fictional, supposed composite character, and Nichole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson. Hollywood criticism of the presentation of leggy blondes can only be taken so far without becoming completely laughable, after all.The stories of Kelly and Carlson have already been well covered by the media--especially by competitors of FoxNews, such as CNN and MSNBC, so there's hardly anything new here to digest. The fiction of Robbie's character, on the other hand, as well as that of her make-believe friend and closet lesbian and closet Hillary Clinton supporter portrayed by Kate McKinnon, seems to me to present a host of problems. It's hard to take the depiction of a hostile work environment seriously with such fabrications as a character silently walking away and quitting as Rupert Murdoch delivers a speech. Even if the characters provide such easy opportunities as to question Kelly's responsibility to other women or to also mention Bill O'Reilly's sexual misconduct, they also come across as caricatures that undermine the picture's fidelity.On the other hand, the characterizations of other FoxNews hosts as minor characters here may be amusing, including the sycophantic boys club made up of the likes of Sean Hannity and Neil Cavuto, the parading of female performers in short skirts, the felicitously rabid depiction of Jeanine Pirro, or the constant dread around the offices of being labeled a ""feminist,"" including for Kelly's daring to question a would-be president over his sexist remarks. I'm less fond of the fourth-wall-breaking in the style of screenwriter Charles Randolph's prior ""The Big Short"" (2015), as well as Adam McKay's subsequent ""Vice"" (2018), though. That ""Bombshell"" isn't as nasty or as flippant as those overrated Best-Picture nominees may explain its lackluster love from critics and the Academy, too. But, the makeup and hairstyling here, along with the clothes, are fully deserving of their awards consideration, and Theron especially is remarkable in her imitation of a well-known, contemporary public figure. As if we needed further proof from the actress in everything from ""Monster"" (2003), to ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015) and ""Atomic Blonde"" (2017), that she's one of the all-time-great acting chameleons.

41,eddie_baggins,Not the film this true story deserved,5,11 May 2020,"Bombshell badly wants to be another Big Short or to a lesser extent Vice.Both of those films saw heavy subject matters told with a vitality and verve, which saw the growth of comedy filmmaker Adam McKay making the leap into dramatic storytelling, some how managing to tie together intricate true stories and their various plot points into a palatable feature length runtime.No doubt inspired by his fellow director, Jay Roach (the man that gave us Meet the Parents and Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery) finds himself in very serious territory as he examines the recent fallout of Fox News head honcho Roger Ailes in the midst of various reports of sexual harassment and mistreatment of women during his reign in the studio doing the bidding of the wealthy Murdoch media empire.It's a loaded subject matter, one ripped straight from the headlines of yesterday and it features a stunning cast lead by the always good Charlize Theron as Trump critic and TV reporter Megyn Kelly, Nicole Kidman as pioneering spokesperson of the abuse Gretchen Carlson, Margot Robbie as upstart Fox worker Kayla Pospisil and a near unrecognizable John Lithgow as Ailes, but Roach's fast-moving expose of the saga never manages to combine all its elements and incendiary documentation into a cohesive or truly gripping whole.Proceedings start off well with Theron guiding the audience through a quick-fire rundown on how the Fox Studios operate under the ever watchful eye of Ailes, who is like an Orwellian Big Brother, security cameras and all, but from there we're never gripped by a story that while shocking and horrific, fails to maximize its power to create the dramatic experience this awards baiting exercise was no doubt seeking.In many ways the film feels as though it has bitten off more than it can chew, with three amazing leading ladies at its core and a beloved industry veteran playing a genuinely vile real-life villain there should've been a lot more standout moments throughout the film but it feels like nothing more than a procession of boxes being ticked as we march forward to the films conclusion, one that when it arrives feels like a whimper rather than a bang.A shame, as Bombshell's story and its cast of real life characters should make for fascinating viewing, no doubt more likely to be better explored in the documentaries and series that will likely stem from a saga that beggars belief.Final Say -Performances are solid and the story important but Bombshell feels like a rather cold and forgettable examination of some recent headline making news, news that should've made for a far more gripping and emotional piece of storytelling than we get here.2 ½ Fox logos out of 5",Bombshell

If you have seen that movie, ""Bombshell"" will feel familiar in style: a lot of nervous energy, as if you are in the middle of the newsroom yourself. But truth be told that much of the credit must go to the three lead performances: Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly, Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson, and Margot Robbie as (fictional) Kayla. And kudos also to John Lithow, who plays the utter despicable Roger Ailes.

48,Turfseer,Lack of suspense and sanitized depiction of female Fox broadcasters diminish otherwise solid re-telling of Fox News head honcho's downfall,6,15 February 2020,"Bombshell chronicles the end of an era at Fox News, with the abrupt departure of Roger Ailes, head of the conservative network, one year before his death in 2017. It's a story I was only slightly familiar with, having read a few headlines and articles about it, at the time it all took place. Director Jay Roach and screenwriter Charles Randolph attempt to flesh out the particulars with modest success.
The main focus is on Megyn Kelly played solidly by dead-ringer Charlize Theron. When we're first introduced to the popular Fox broadcaster, she suddenly finds herself losing standing among various Fox viewers, after questioning then Presidential candidate Donald Trump, about purported allegations regarding his underlying sexism. It gets to the point where Kelly must ask Ailes for security protection after she and her family receive death threats.
The main plot swirls around another prominent Fox broadcaster, Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), who is summarily fired and decides to personally sue Ailes for sexual harassment. To buttress her case, Carlson's attorneys make it clear that corroborating testimony must be garnered from other female Fox news staff, victims of Ailes' concerted efforts at sexual harassment. Little time is spent in developing the Carlson character.
A fictional character, Kayla Pospisil (an attractive Margot Robbie), is introduced to illustrate how Ailes operated (here he has Pospisil lift up her dress so he can leeringly view her body during a potential promotion interview). Another fictional character, Jess Carr (Kate McKinnon), provides some added satire as a Fox employee, a liberal lesbian, unable to find employment with a more sympathetic left-leaning network due to her association with Fox.
John Lithgow virtually steals the show as Ailes, who comes off as more of a pathetic control freak beset with health problems than a megalomaniacal sex harasser. Bombshell also features cameos from actors who resemble notable Fox News personalities including Bill O'Reilly (played by Kevin Dorf, a dead ringer), Geraldo Rivera (Tony Plana), Sean Hannity (Spencer Garrett), Jeanine Pirro (Alana Ubach) and Chris Wallace (Marc Evan Jackson). Even Rudy Giuliani (Richard Kind) gets in the act as one of Ailes' attorneys.
Unfortunately, Randolph's script is least successful in fleshing out the cameo parts, suggesting that a good deal of the more juicy behind-the-scenes machinations at Fox News, are hidden from public knowledge. The best example of this is in the depiction of Hannity, who uncharacteristically speaks sotto voce, and then largely disappears.
Despite being a decent enough recounting of the events revolving around Ailes' termination, the film suffers from a lack of suspense. The big question in the second half of Act II, is whether Kelly will decide to join Carlson's lawsuit, despite experiencing Ailes' harassment, ten years earlier. The outcome is of course well known by most.
There is also something unsatisfying in the way that the film's scenarists make their protagonists more palatable for a liberal audience. Kelly immediately wins points by pushing back against Trump, but the back story of both women's conservative backgrounds are diminished to the point where one would never know of Kelly's checkered past as a bit of a racial arsonist and Carlson's outright homophobia.
Still, Bombshell is entertaining enough, especially the manner in which it chronicles how Ailes was ultimately terminated. Malcolm McDowell is another scene-stealer as the imperious Rupert Murdoch, who unceremoniously drops his former enforcer Ailes, refusing to allow him to present a fond farewell speech and then temporarily taking over the reins, so that his network can expeditiously sail through the dark waters of the head honcho's firing.
Fans of feminist empowerment will probably get a kick out of how a group of female professionals took down two Fox icons (Ailes and O'Reilly) but probably are reluctant in acknowledging that the same bastion of male power and privilege remains in the offices and boardrooms at Fox News today.",Bombshell

This movie is based on true incidences concerning sexual harassment at Fox News. John plays Roger Ailes, the boss at Fox News that is only outranked in power by the owner, Rupert Murdock. Nicole plays Gretchen Carlson, the first to accuse John of misconduct in the work place. Charlize plays Megyn Kelly, one of the anchors of the news show and Margot plays a composite character-not based on any one person-that has also felt the abuse perpetrated by John. There is a scene that John tells Margot to raise her dress higher to show off her legs. He keeps telling her to go higher and higher until he can see her underwear-no nudity is involved. The story is explosive, especially in this day and age, when there shouldn't be any sexual abuse at all. Sadly, it still happens-I've seen it in the work place myself-and people don't seem to care. And yes, I've said something about it but people just laugh and say that it's just harmless fun or a joke or something. Sexual abuse comes in many forms-not just having sex-and people in positions of power should not take advantage of people below them, just because they can. There are several cameos; I remember seeing Stephen Root, Connie Britton, Allison Janney and Malcolm McDowell.
It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.

Based on a true story involving media titan Roger Ailes and his ""hands on"" training methods of aspirant ladies looking for a career at Fox, it broods rather than move.All men are conniving sleazy tomcats according to Charles Randolph's script as fictional character Kayla Posipipil is finding out at Fox. Thank heavens lesbian Jess Carr is around to help guide her through the swamp of male creeps, the biggest and most repulsive Ailes (John Lithgow) also the most powerful. Even between the sheets with naïve Kayla she can respect boundaries. There's also real life survivors Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) to bring veracity to the script but given their rich and famous life style hardly in a position to match the urgent music and pensive expressions of life in the balance the film is providing them.I'm not downplaying the seriousness of sexual harassment in the work place, it should not be tolerated anywhere. The stage in Bombshell they choose to shed light on it is permeated with privileged, entitled and intelligent people who have been around the block however with access to legal council. Better they should examine it among blue collar workers with neither alternative or recourse like the parade of energetic blonds who are down to get their foot in the door, then when powerful enough, suddenly shocked and lawyered up by the tone of the conversation. The lettuce picker, the widgit maker in a factory could use the exposure more than these pretty rich girls, multi millionaires Fox and Carlson.

A third women, an ambitious new employee (Robbie) is Ailes' latest fixation, with promises of a great career in return for gestures of loyalty.A fascinating insight into right wing politics and corporate America - it is remarkable what was quite recently acceptable behaviour and probably still is. The difficulty with the story is that all three had accepted the position they were put into to achieve success and whilst this doesn't make this right, the film it is to be enjoyed through watching the women tackle the issue, not through any form of empathy - Theron and Kidman's characters are not particularly appealing. The performances are excellent. Theron is essentially the lead and is impressive under subtle make up, whilst Kidman and Robbie are equally persuasive in support roles.

60,masonfisk,A FILM FOR OUR UNFORTUNATE TIMES...!,8,7 September 2020,"Jay Roach's (Meet the Parents/Austin Powers trilogy) barbed expose of the sexual goings-on at Fox News from last year. Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman & Margot Robbie (Theron & Robbie were nominated for their performances) are the triptych in which this tale is told when Kidman's Gretchen Carlson is fired from her position & goes after Fox News director Roger Ailes, played by John Lithgow in a fat suit, for sexual harassment. The story then unfolds through the other 2 leads; Theron's Megan Kelly & Robbie (a composite character) as they wait & see if more women will step forward & admit they were harassed as well or will the corporate, he-man pressure of this conservative bastion of right wing demagogues continue to practice business as usual. Theron wearing prostethics & adapting Kelly's speech patterns knocks it out of the park in a tough but brittle composite of a woman barely holding it together in skewed man's world. Coupled w/his biopic on Trumbo (Dalton), Roach seems to left his broad comedy roots behind & I think that's a good thing since he has a good knack for getting good performances from actors & has a deft touch when it comes to storytelling. Another nice aspect of this film is its use of real life personalities from Fox TV (unfortunately they've become ubiquitous as they're mentioned as much as our Sherbet-in-Chief has) so to see notable actors (Jennifer Morrison, Allana Ulbach, Tony Plana, Malcolm McDowell, Tricia Helfer, Alice Eve, Ashley Greene, etc) play real life people, it becomes a game of 'who's going to show up to play who.'",Bombshell

Robbie especially is in one scene that just shook me, a scene that could have easily just been titillation but thanks to her performance was the exact right kind of discomfort and outrage. But, the movie doesn't know who to focus on.

I know of Fox News because it's seen as a laughing stock around the world and as the Trump supporting network .
While The Loudest Voice is more about the CEO of FOX and his awful methods , Bombshell is about the women who were victim to his sexual abuse .I actually found Bombshell the weaker of the two versions of the story .
Don't get me wrong , it's a pretty good attempt at exposing what went on at FOX . The performances from Charlize Theron , Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman are good but the standout has to be Theron.The facial makeup and prosthetics that are used to make her look more like Megyn Kelly are at first a distraction but after a while you get used to it and it got to the point where I actually thought she looked really good !While Margot Robbie was great I thought the dialogue for Kayla Pospisil was contradictory and confusing at times . One minute she was strong but in the next moment she was weak and easily manipulated.The one think I hope that comes out of this film is that shows how ridiculous FOX news and it's viewers are . Regardless of the sexual misconduct, the fact that it's news is so biased towards the right and that a massive part of the American population believe what they see is Incredible.

63,truemythmedia,Decent. Probably Could've Been Better.,6,30 December 2019,"""""Bombshell"" has its heart in the right place, I'll give it that. But there's something about this film that doesn't quite strike home for me on quite a few different levels. The directing is only so-so; the pacing is a little weird; the writing is pretty heavy handed (something I already expected going in, but it exceeded my expectations as far as heavy-handedness goes), particularly when it came to dragging Trump into this affair (don't get me wrong, I don't like the guy, but this film went out of its way to continuously include him in the story); and the fictionalized portions of the story, most of which revolve around Kayla (Margot Robbie, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") and her in-office, closeted lesbian, friend Jess Carr (Kate McKinnon, ""Yesterday""), feel pretty farfetched and silly, and that sort of detracts from the overall message the film is trying to send. At the same time, the true portions of the story were interesting, and I learned a bit; I thought all of the actors did a fine job; and, as I said before, this film's heart was in the right place: it is trying to forward a feminist workspace, and I think that's a very good thing.While I was watching this film, however, I couldn't help but constantly wonder who this film was made for, because there were certain sections of the movie that were so heavy-handed it felt like I was watching a Christian film like ""God's Not Dead"", but instead of the creators building towards a sort of altar call they were shouting for Fox News to change its ways. The hard-rights- the people that wholeheartedly believe that Trump is right 100% of the time, that he has a God-given right to be president, the ones that listen to Fox News and believe whatever they say is 100% right 100% of the time- those are the kinds of people that really need to see this movie, because those are the hearts that need to be changed. The problem with this movie is that it is so blatantly attacking Fox News, Trump, and everyone in that establishment in such a naked way that anyone who might benefit from hearing that criticism will almost certainly avoid this movie. Yes, Robert Ailes (played by John Lithgow, ""Raising Caine"") was a bad guy, and yes, Fox News needed to change its work atmosphere, but this film certainly wouldn't change anyone's mind whom wasn't already willing to have it changed.",Bombshell

65,jadepietro,A Powerful Plea Against Sexual Harassment,10,29 December 2019,"GRADE: A-THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Excellent exposé about sexual harassment in the workplace with superb performances by a fine cast, led by a remarkable Charlize Theron.JIM'S REVIEW: A few weeks ago, I reviewed the docudrama, Richard Jewell, Clint Eastwood's fine but biased right-wing view of a wronged man maligned by the press, law enforcement agencies, and the American public in their unwarranted rush to judgment. So it's only right that I now review the docudrama, Bombshell, Jay Roach's fine but biased left-wing view of the right man accused of sexual harassment scandals that plagued Rupert Murdock's conservative Fox News Division. Both are polarizing films about controversial subjects, yet there are strong similarities in the storytelling.Bombshell is quite an apt title. The word is defined as:
1. An overwhelming surprise or disappointment
2. A very attractive woman
Choose whichever multiple meaning and it would apply to the very crux of the film.Bombshell explores the explosive scandal that discredited Rupert Murdock's Fox News Division and destroyed the career of its CEO Roger Ailes. The uncompromising position forced upon several women at the network became a definite quid pro quo situation of possibly granting sexual favors for career advancement. The film dramatically (or melodramatically, at times) follows the lives of three victims who protested these injustices and the toxic work environment at the news channel. Usually, blurring the line between fact and fiction may make a better story, but prevents the truth from being heard. This film avoids most of the pitfalls of biographical films due to its contemporary themes and riveting acting. To the film's credit, it begins with a disclaimer and does not disguise the fact that the movie is a drama loosely based on true events.The film centers on three ambitious career-oriented women setting them on a collision course with a sexual predator. Will these victims form a sisterhood and unite to go against the powers in charge? Nothing is easy; their names are not changed to protect the innocent. Well known news personality Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), is one of Fox's top news anchors. Next to her on the good old boys' chauvinistic food chain is Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman). Together they are the ""pretty "" faces on view at Fox News, until charges are leveled against their mentor, Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), nearly unrecognizable under the prothetic make-up design. Striving to become a household name is Kayla Pospilsil (Margot Robbie). The battle lines are now crossed as the MeToo Movement begins.Now you may not of heard of the last person, as she is an amalgamation of other victimized women and the character, as written, is purely fictitious. Call it poetic license, but this plot device is still a major misstep and weakness in this or any film based on true events, as it was the recent Clintwood bio-pic. But Bombshell stays with the facts as much as possible in retelling its tale of sex, corporate greed, and corruption. Its screenplay by Charles Randolph creates believable characters and articulate dialog when meeting the issue of sexual harassment head-on. Some moments do become preachy sermons, but the story is handled with such eloquence and sensitivity.The casting, right down to the minor players, is perfection. Ms. Theron portrayal of Megyn.Kelly is remarkable and fully nuanced. Her vocal delivery, physical appearance, and identifiable movements are so very accurate and real. (Kudos to Vivian Baker, Cristina Waltz, and Richard Redlefsen for their tremendous contributions on her and the other cast members' make-up work.) Providing excellent support are Ms. Kidman and Ms. Bobbie as the other victimized women. Both actresses make their intense moments resonant. Perhaps, the hardest role is the villain of the piece and Mr. Lithgow convincingly plays his character as a ruthless and unlikable misfit obsessed with his petty need for control. He preys upon those objects of his carnal desires. All deserve award consideration. Also bringing their significant talents to the film are Connie Britton, Rob Delaney, Mark Duplass, Malcolm McDowell, Holland Taylor, Alanna Ubach, Allison Janney, and a winning Kate McKinnon.Mr. Roach's direction is very adept at setting up conflicts and depicting these horrible incidents with matter-of-factly precision. He never sidesteps uncomfortable or disturbing encounters as in his scene with a lecherous Mr. Lithgow ogling a nervous Mr. Bobbie. The scene might be based on pure conjuncture, but the overall impact is shockingly real and creates empathy for her and other women who have had to condone this treatment. Watch Ms. Kidman quickly get shunned by staff members for stating the truth, or hear an emotional confessional moment between Ms. Theron and a co-worker about her previously secret transgressions. It all makes for powerful, if manipulative, filmmaking.Bombshell has a specific vision and voice. The film takes its explosive topic and brings the uneasy issue of sexual harassment centerstage, making a plea for those women who deserve to be seen and heard. Do not miss this riveting film. One of the year's best films.",Bombshell
66,rgkarim,Is this to Bomb? A Review of Bombshell,7,21 December 2019,"LIKES:The Setting
Decent Pace
Good Use of Main characters
Fantastic Acting
Contained Political Fury
Factual Approach and Detailed
The MakeupDISLIKES:Character Utilization Imbalance
The unnecessary introductions of every character
The Side story that sort of was not necessary
Kate McKinnon side story to some extents
Did not appreciate the Asides
Lackluster Suspense
The VERDICT:Bombshell is a great installment to the biography world because it makes a realistic story, that seems more factual than dramatic. It uses good visuals and great acting to help with bringing the story to life and gives a complete tale that should be inspirational for many. Throw in that it kept the political frenzy to a minimum, and the film opens up to a wider variety of people who can see the horrors these women faced. Yet, the movie still has not quite found the art of drama vs factual and could have used a little pep in the department to help unleash the full impact and excitement of the movie. In addition, the side stories and over-political moments still creep in and though not the worst I've seen, felt they added little to the story over all, but stuck around for some representation politics. Overall, the movie is not awful or overbearing, but it could have had the same impact but on a streaming service or rental and that is where I would encourage you to watch it.My scores are:Biography/Drama: 6.5
Movie Overall: 6.0",Bombshell
67,richard-1787,"A fine movie if you watch it for what it is, and not for what you want it to be or are afraid it might be",9,31 December 2019,"I saw this movie yesterday and much enjoyed it. The acting by the three principles is very good, as almost all the 100 previous viewers agree.What I found even more interesting than the movie itself, however, was how it has been reviewed on here.Many of those who liked the movie commended it for exposing a toxic anti-woman culture at FOX News. It doesn't, really. It shows how the head, Roger Ailes, exploited women shamelessly. But other than that, it does not concern itself with other cases of the same thing at FOX, other than to show a man walk by a woman and make inappropriate remarks about her dress.Some of those who disliked it complained that the movie focused on what went on at FOX but does not deal with similar problems in other, more liberal organizations. It's quite true that it doesn't do that, but it's one 105 minute drama, not a documentary series on PBS. Again, an unfair criticism of this movie.Others complained that it attacks Trump. It doesn't. Nor does it attack FOX for presenting a conservative slant on the news.In short, it does not play to the hopes of either liberals or conservatives who hoped it would advance their agenda or attack their opposition.It presents the cases of two real women, Gretchen Carlson and Megan Kelly, and one fictional character meant to represent other women who worked at FOX, who were sexually harrassed by its head. It does that very well, and in a very sympathetic fashion.Does it, in the process, present an accurate depiction of those two real women? I can't say. The movie begins by stating very clearly that things have been changed to develop the drama. That, to me, exonerates it from having to be a spot-on, perfectly accurate depiction of all the facts and nothing but the facts.If you want to know all those facts, undramatised, read some books. That's why historians write such books.If you want an hour and three quarters of well-paced drama and fine acting, I strongly recommend this movie.",Bombshell
68,justin-fencsak,OK movie. The Loudest Voice was better.,6,12 August 2020,"Years after Roger Ailes died two works were made about the former chairman of Fox News and the way he treated his clients. One was the Showtime miniseries The Loudest Voice, which was heavily promoted and starred Russell Crowe as Roger Ailes and did so so ratings, and the other is Bombshell, a box office bomb starring Nicole Kidman Margot Robbie and Charlize Theron as the Fox News ladies and John Lithgow as Roger. Both were under the gun. It's kinda educational too although the subject matter might not be good for kids.",Bombshell
69,Kingslaay,Title says it all,7,18 January 2020,Bombshell was explosive and pulls back the curtain all the way. Through the eyes of 3 women we see the take down of a media mogul. This was a well made film with big reveals from start to finish. The filming is so authentic and spliced well with real footage its like you're in the room. Some strong performances from Nicole Kidman and Charlize Theron. Charlize Theron looks exactly like Meghan Kelly. In fact I actually thought Meghan had a role in this film but realised it was a stunning transformation. This is the strongest resemblance I have ever seen in film.It shows that no one is too powerful enough to be brought down. Amazing how this kind of behaviour still happens and it was courageous and long overdue that Roger Ailes got pulled him. Great film. 7.5/10,Bombshell

71,nancyldraper,Well executed!,9,4 January 2020,"It was interesting to watch this after finishing THE LOUDEST VOICE just the week before. The latter focuses on Ailes rise to power by building Fox News, and, then, his fall because of his abuse of that same power. This movie looks at the Fox climate, and the systemic abuse of power through the lense of the women. The acting is superb from the whole cast but the three powerhouse female leads are perfection. (I want to take a minute to say that Kate McKinnon finally broke through as a dramatic actor. I had opined, in a review of YESTERDAY, that she needed to find the real people behind her caricatures, and, in this, she did! I knew she had it in her.) This is an important perspective and an interesting movie, which is why I rate this film a 9 (well told) out of 10. {Based on a Real Drama}",Bombshell
72,michaeltrivedi,Didn't Finish,7,28 December 2019,"Now. I would maybe say this could be one of the top three best movies of 2019, at least in my opinion. I did not finish it, though I plan to in the future, perhaps not even soon. But eventually within the year.I really enjoy movies that explore a topic you hardly notice. Something that is seldom seen in movies. One example is Deepwater Horizon. Another could be Sully. These are movies that are just different, and eye opening. Something you didn't know you cared about.Trump is a hot topic. Talk about his sexual background, and you've got everyone in the room interested. Now link that with the corporate world in general, still good stuff. Now add three hot blondes, some of the best actresses to be billed, and you've got a decent watch.The movie is about three women. One is an established woman on broadcast news. The other is less established, and losing popularity. And the other is on the rise. Each go through their own experiences of witnessing sexual harassment in the workplace.It's some good stuff. I had to stop myself a time or two to explore my own ideas on the topic, and how good this movie could make them pleasurable.If they got the ending right, this could be one of the best of the year, at least to me. I don't know, I must have turned it off because it wasn't going anywhere. Politics is always boring. Some could do it right, though not sure if this one could.7 stars",Bombshell

76,proud_luddite,Good and timely,7,30 May 2020,"Based on a true story: Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) was the head of Fox News beginning in 1996. In 2016, he faced accusations of sexual assault from Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and Kayla Pospisil (a composite character played by Margot Robbie).Director Jay Roach orchestrates an energetic beginning with a very dynamic, fast-moving pace. This early segment reveals the fast pace of the work life in a news organization along with the careerist attitudes that go with it.The exposure of careerism is fascinating: there is a secondary character (played by Kate McKinnon) who could only get a job at Fox News but had to take it despite being a misfit (secretive about her lesbianism and liberalism). Her Catch-22 is that no other news organization will hire her or take her seriously as she works for Fox News; the film also shows another side to an old cliché about women who acted sexually to advance their careers (I won't repeat the cliché here). In ""Bombshell"", there is more compassion to those who regretted such decisions and wished there had been a better way to advance.The solid cast is great while Robbie (so good in ""I, Tonya"") stands out in a very intense interview scene that gradually turns into a harassment situation. Her face shows so many conflicting emotions including the excitement of career advancement vs. extreme discomfort with what is happening.Some opportunities are missed including the chance for the main characters to deal with the inner conflict of working for a right-wing organization (one that has derided feminism) vs. taking on the actions and attitudes of traditional feminists. In fact, there is little evidence at all of the right-wing beliefs of the leading women. But ""Bombshell"" is still a good film whose subject matter and outlook are perfect for our current times in which the consequences of sexual harassment are better understood than they ever have been. - dbamateurcritic",Bombshell

81,rockman182,Bombshell (2019),7,13 December 2019,"I was extremely interested in watching this film. Fox News is a circus at times but I really wanted to see a portrayal of the incidents surrounding sexual harassment and Roger Ailes. I also thought the three leads involved are really great castings and wanted to see how two of them portrayed Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly. The film touches on important matters that has recently come to the light in droves, however the film doesn't always reach its potential although I did enjoy the film for the most part.
The film is based on the story of the accounts of women who worked at Fox News and the allegations that came out against Fox News CEO, Roger Ailes. A movement that is led by seasoned television host Gretchen Carlson, after her firing from the company. She is soon joined by other women including Megyn Kelly. The film has a really great cast including Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, Charlize Theron, and John Lithgow. Jay Roach returns after a brief hiatus in film making to bring this effort.
I have to commend the make up department firstly. Theron really looks like Megyn Kelly in this film that at times I feel like its hard to not see Kelly. Same with Kidman as Carlson. The acting delivers on all fronts. Margot Robbie who plays a fictional employee who typifies the type of victim Ailes prayed on, was also very good. I was very interested in the subject matter for this film as its timely and should make for a riveting story. A shocking story based on a wicked truth coming to light; this should be a very worthy film. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite reach that potential.I feel like the film could go deeper into making a statement although I was fine with what we got. At times it felt like the film was more interested in showing the real life correspondents being portrayed briefly, rather than going in depth into characterization. Not a bad film but feel like it wanted to be more and I also wanted more from it. Not sure its going to make awards buzz outside of Theron and Robbie's performances.6.5/10",Bombshell
82,tbills2,3 Bombshell Actresses,5,24 January 2021,"Suspending my disbelief to where I believe Megyn Kelly or these other 2 conservative pundits were actually attractive bombshells or extremely sexy women like the actresses portraying them is just too much. It represents a total fantasy. Talk about altering history in the worst possible way imaginable, it only works for the disturbing idea that is this movie's objective. Nobody wanted this story to begin with and even though Charlize Theron does sound exactly like Megyn Kelly a lot of the time giving her best capable performance, Bombshell is still a story about Megyn freaking Kelly and Fox freaking News. Instead make a movie about Charli D'Amelio and her sister, Dixie, please! I wish this movie was about like 3 single ladies on vacation together getting caught up in a drug syndicate in an overseas foreign city or something. I think Margot Robbie is hotter than Charlize but not really Nicole. Nicole was hotter back in the day. I don't know though Margot might actually be way hotter than Nicole she IS Harley Quinn! These 3 women are all legendary what a momentous movie! I love Bombshell even though it's not about much. It has award worthy performances it's just trashy material.

84,bankofmarquis,Well acted - and important - film,8,31 January 2020,"The new Jay Roach film, BOMBSHELL - the Fox News sex scandal film - focuses on the struggles of 3 female protagonists - Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) and Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) - as they attempt to climb (or stay at the top of) the Corporate Ladder while battling sexism and a toxic work culture at Fox News. It is a powerful story that is a necessary tale in the ""#MeToo"" era that demands viewers to stand up and take notice.And with powerhouse actresses leading this film - standing up and taking notice is an easy thing to do.Based on factual events, BOMBSHELL portrays the sexism that female on air personalities encounter at FoxNews - a place filled with ""good ol' boys"" who patronize and sexualize the females in the office to the detriment of the females and the benefit and gratification of the males. Surprisingly, they are joined in this by some other females in the office who figure ""better them than me"". At the top of the office - and the toxic work culture - is Roger Ailes (an almost unrecognizable John Lithgow) who is hailed by Fox as the man who can create the news - and profits.Kidman, Theron and Robbie are well cast in their roles, showing nuance, concern and strength as these negative conditions rear their ugly heads over and over again. All 3 produce powerhouse performances - certainly up there amongst the best of their careers - and Theron and Robbie are well deserved Oscar nominees for their performances. Kidman was NOT nominated for her performance, but she is just as deserving as the other two.But, for me, the real surprise - and the best performance - of this film belongs to Lithgow's portrayal of Ailes. His characterization shows a real wolf, taking advantage of his status and position, to prey upon those in his office. It is a sly, evil performance of a sly, evil man. What impressed me the most is that this performance - and this character - could have easily gone ""over the top"" into ""pure villain"" territory and Lithgow resists this temptation - to the betterment of this film, but to the detriment of his Oscar chances.As written by Charles Randolph (THE BIG SHORT) this film has a pacing/theming issue for the first 1/2 hour of this film. Is it a serious film? Is it sarcastic look at toxic masculinity work culture? Is it an indictment on our current society as a whole? Randolph's script uses some of the same tactics as THE BIG SHORT, having performers breaking the 4th wall and commenting and narrating the events while looking directly at the camera. While this tactic worked very well in THE BIG SHORT (if you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend you do), it works less well here and Director Jay Roach (TRUMBO) wisely drops that ""gimmick"" after the first 1/2 hour.This film is filled with wonderful character actors making extended (and powerful) cameos. The likes of Kate McKinnon, Allyson Janney, Holland Taylor, Connie Britton, Stephen Root, Malcolm McDowell, Robin Weigert, Mark Duplass, Richard Kind, Mark Moses and Tricia Helfer all contribute greatly to the film while shining in the little screen time they have.A necessary - and powerful - film filled with tremendous performances that shine a light on a problem that is pervasive today. Which makes this film a must watch - as difficult as it is to watch at times.Letter Grade: A- (the first 1/2 hour brings it down a point)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",Bombshell
85,Danusha_Goska,"Literate Script, Fast Pace, All-Star Cast, Important Topic. A Terrific Movie",10,23 December 2019,"""Bombshell"" has a literate, fast-moving and yet profound script and an all-star cast acting out a morality tale that concerns every thinking American. It's a terrific movie. This movie is so good it actually surprised me. It didn't fall into the predictable traps I expected.""Bombshell"" is about Roger Ailes' sexual harassment of female talent at FOX news. Ailes' behavior is depicted as utterly repugnant. John Lithgow's Ailes is a disgusting, rotting hulk of a man, obese, bald, flabby, and reliant on a walker.In a cringe-inducing scene, Ailes, a putrescent blob in a big chair, orders Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie), a naïve true-believer in FOX News, to lift her skirt higher so he can see her legs. Pospisil is wearing a miniskirt. She has to lift her skirt up over her underpants. As she does so, Ailes becomes aroused. The look on Kayla's face tells us that she is realizing what's going on, she recognizes that she's doing this for a job in TV, and she suddenly hates herself and everything that is happening.But ""Bombshell"" takes a while to get to that scene. Before that scene, Ailes is shown as a stalwart support to female star Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron). He gives Kelly good advice and she is grateful to him. ""Bombshell"" doesn't demonize Ailes. Ailes is a fully rounded character. Surprising.Megyn Kelly, similarly, is complex. She is a protagonist, but she's not perfect. When Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) speaks out about her sexual harassment, she hopes for support from other women at FOX. Support is slow to come. Though Ailes had harassed Kelly years before, Kelly is slow to come forward. She doesn't want to hurt her career, not just for her own sake, but for the sake of her family and her show's producers.For a movie that moves this quickly to be so complex is a rare feat. The script was co-written by Charles Randolph, who won the Academy Award for co-writing ""The Big Short"" script. The film is co-written and directed by Jay Roach, who has received a slew of awards and nominations.The cast just never stops. Just when you think you're already awash in big names giving award-worthy performances, Alison Janney pops up as Susan Estrich, Roger Ailes' attorney, and Malcolm McDowell walks in as Rupert Murdoch. Kate McKinnon shines in a small role. Actors depicting Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Geraldo Rivera, Harris Faulkner, Judge Jeannine Pirro and Kimberly Guilfoyle accessorize the sidelines.The Kayla Pospisil character is a fictionalized composite of various accounts of how Ailes would sexually harass women. She is clearly young, naïve, and ambitious. She comes from an Evangelical family that worships FOX news and all it stands for. She wears a cross around her neck. She's also a lesbian. She's the only woman actually depicted giving in to Ailes' perversions.Is the Kayla character a Christophobic one? In creating her, are script-writers Jay Roach and Charles Randolph implying that FOX news viewers are hypocrites? After all, Kayla is a lesbian but has taken sides with folks who condemn lesbians. Evangelicals, of course, value sexual purity, and she is the only female character depicted actually selling her body for airtime.Or, are the scriptwriters not mocking FOX viewers, but highlighting how FOX viewers, often poor and working class, are cheated, duped, used and discarded - metaphorically f----- by men like Rupert Murdoch, Roger Ailes, and Donald Trump? Men who cajole these masses into betraying the ideals represented by the crosses worn around their necks? I don't know the answer to that.",Bombshell
86,sjanders-86430,Jay Roach directs 2016,10,4 February 2021,"This film depicts the fall of CEO Roger Ailes from Fox News. John Lithgow plays Ailes. The 2019 film was made three years after the fact and two years after the fall of Harvey Weinstein and the Me Too Movement. Ailes made Rupert Murdoch richer giving him the top news network. He did that by sexualizing the look of the femake newscasters played by Charlize Theron, Megan Kelly, Nicole Kidman, Gretchen Carlson, and Margot Robbie. The film shows the short dresses the anchors were told to wear so their legs would show under the plexiglass table.
Ailes had 20 some women testify that he had sexually harassed them. One recorded his words. He walked away with a substantial pension. Bombshell's tone is lightweight. The anchor men are untouchable while the women have to look good and be likeable. Women are objectified to boost ratings. I find the tone of this film very disturbing. Jay Roach, the director, and Charles Randolph, the writer are to blame; they don't get the depth of the problem.",Bombshell

88,bob-the-movie-man,Sleazy old Fox.,7,26 January 2020,"This is a curious one. I wonder whether the audience reaction to this one will polarize along gender lines as it did for my wife and I? For I thought this one was ""good, but nothing special""... but the illustrious Mrs Movie Man thought it was excellent and would be ""memorable"".The movie is based on the true story of the first ""Me Too"" case against a prominent man in power. Before Harvey Weinstein (allegedly!) there was Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), CEO of the Fox Network. Under the shadowy gaze of the Murdoch brothers (Ben Lawson and Josh Lawson), Ailes rules Fox with a rod of iron. Unfortunately, it's Ailes' - ahem - 'rod of iron' that is part of the problem.Three women are at the centre of the drama. Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) is a leading anchorwoman, fighting her own battles in a man's world. She is currently in trouble with 50% of the US population for taking a firm stand on-screen against Trump's treatment of women; Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) is a broadcaster approaching her 50's and being shunted progressively towards the door, via afternoon shows, in favour of 'younger models'; Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) is a keen new-starter, ambitious and keen as mustard to impress her bosses, including Ailes.The three women seldom interact (a scene in a lift is a study in awkwardness) but are all on different stages of the same journey.I clearly saw a review which referenced the movie as being ""Adam McKay-like"" since I went in assuming that McKay (""Vice"", ""The Big Short"") was the director of this one. For that reason, I was puzzled. Yes, there were occasions where the actors broke the 4th wall; and there were little visual tricks (a burned in Fox logo for example) that entertained. But it wasn't the close-to-the-edge roller-coaster of innovation that I have come to expect from a McKay film.When the titles rolled, it was an ""Aha"" moment! Actually, the director is the Austin Powers director Jay Roach. Not that he hasn't done drama as well: he did the Bryan Cranston vehicle ""Trumbo"" a few years back. And another MacKay link is the writer: the screenplay is by Charles Randolph, the writer of ""The Big Short"".The leading ladies in this really are leading, with Charlize Theron picking up a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar nomination and Margot Robbie getting the Best Supporting nom. Theron is brilliant in everything she does, and here she is chameleon-like in disappearing into her character. I wasn't as sure about Robbie early in the film, but an excruciating ""twirl"" for Ailes is brilliantly done and an emotional scene during a date is Oscar-reel worthy.Great supporting turns come from ""The West Wing's"" Allison Janney and from Kate McKinnon. McKinnon was the most annoying thing in ""Yesterday"", as the brash US agent, but here she is effective as the lesbian friend of Kayla.Holding up the male end (as it were) is a fantastic performance from John Lithgow (surprisingly overlooked during the awards season) and Malcolm McDowell delivering an uncanny Rupert Murdoch.Overall, the ""Me Too"" movement has created an earthquake in popular culture. Many more movies featuring strong female leads have appeared in the last few years, and that's great. This is a reminder of the time before that, when men openly used their power to force unwanted sex on employees. And its horrifying and disconcerting to watch.And it was a good movie. But it just wasn't a ""wow"" movie for me. A female audience will by definition have more experience of this than a male one. Perhaps there is a sense of 'collective guilt' that we blokes need to work through. And perhaps that's a subconscious reason why I didn't 100% engage with the film. (Though I'd like to make it perfectly clear that I don't have any skeletons in that particular closet!)(For the graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook).",Bombshell
89,pietclausen,Overkill spoiled the show,5,26 February 2020,"The story is confusing, but the make-up is excellently done. It is extremely difficult to figure out who's who.

A matter of overkill ruined this film and should have been presented in a more straight forward manner.",Bombshell
90,kjproulx,Great Information in a Mediocre Film,6,4 February 2020,"While I wasn't all that familiar with this story that went on behind the scenes at Fox News, I was very intrigued to see a film tackling one of the very first stories of women taking a stand against a powerful man, abusing that power. While this was a great story overall, there are a lot of elements missing here that could've made it a fantastic film. This film feels more like a tool to showcase how corporations have been run in the past, but there wasn't enough depth to really dive in. Filled with great performances and a true story worth exploring, here's why I believe Bombshell is one big missed opportunity.This film follows a few main characters, but the centrepiece of this story is the fact that Roger Ailes would sexually harass women in order to give them higher positions at Fox News. He did this for years and many of these women kept silent in order to keep their jobs. If this film is accurate, Gretchen Carlson was the first one to speak up and many began to follow her lead. There is a lot of information and many insightful moments that kept my attention, but this film severely suffers from relying on those two things. More than anything, Bombshell wants to get messages out, but the pacing was slow and it felt like I was watching a newspaper article unfold on-screen.Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly was a show-stopper, Margot Robbie as Kayla Pospisil won me over every single time she was on-screen, and Nicole Kidman committed to her role of Gretchen Carlson to the point that I believed every action she made. The problem is that the material they were working with didn't care about making a masterful piece of cinema. This movie would've worked so much better as a documentary in my opinion. Yes, these performances will absolutely be remembered, but the information I got from this movie is what I will remember it for, rather than the film itself.This film is being recognized the most for Margot Robbie and Charlie Theron's performances and the Make-Up and Hairstyling awards, which it absolutely should be, but I also feel another positive is the fact that it also has no shame. This film is presented in a way that makes news outlets look like a disaster to work for and I admired that aspect. I enjoyed watching this movie for the most part, but it just felt like it dragged on, which was surprising, seeing as it only clocks in at about 108 minutes.In the end, Bombshell is well-intentioned but ultimately comes across as an exposé. The performances are all fantastic and the story itself was intriguing enough to hold my attention the whole time, but there wasn't much else to latch onto. While this story deserved some kind of film, I don't believe an adapted narrative was the right decision. Overall, I would say this movie is worth watching, in terms of being informed, but it feels bland otherwise. I wouldn't say this movie deserves your attention, but the story does, however you choose to find out about it. As a whole, it's okay.",Bombshell
91,JohnRayPeterson,"Fox fans and Trump supporters won't like this at all, so it's awesome.",9,11 January 2020,"I fully expect all manners of Trump supporters and Friends of Fox will do all they can to bring the user reviews overall rating down by voting low numbers, including their bots. To that I say fµ¢# you. Facts are facts and the despicable behaviour of Ailes, O'Reily and other misogynistic Fox folks needs to be shouted aloud. That being said, here's what I thought of the movie...John Lithgow did a superb job as Roger Ailes and whoever worked on the prosthetics should share in the glory of that performance. Megyn Kelly, played by Oscar winner Charlize Theron, never looked so good; for all the flatteries I'm tempted to unfurl in Charlize's direction I'll keep in check for fear of embarrassing myself (she ain't no Oscar winner for no reason). I was not a Megyn Kelly fan before this movie but I've since developed some degree of respect, thanks to the performance and no doubt the script.If you didn't get enough of Nicole Kidman's role as Gretchen Carlson in this movie, you are not alone. There is just not enough time in this 01:49hr long movie to cover Gretchen's story, but what was covered was done very well and I liked Kidman's performance. I highly recommend the series ""The Loudest Voice"" to get more, much more on poor Gretchen's fall from grace story; Naomi Watts did a very good job in the series playing Gretchen.For her role as the composite character of Kayla Pospisil, Margot Robbie was the one who, for me, delivered the most sympathetic, believable and transitional emotion heavy performance. Her last scene's performance was the kind you'd want to cheer when she says in action, not with words, fu** this sh**; it was priceless.Let's not forget all the money Fox paid out to silence women in that wretched work environment; it deserved to be told out loud on screen and it was brave for both the producers and actors to take the risk associated with this kind of movie. I'm thankful they did.",Bombshell
92,tm-sheehan,A great companion movie to The Loudest Voice series .An important film.,8,16 January 2020,"Mr Review Bombshell. My Rating 8/10If you haven't already seen The Loudest Voice the Showtime Seven-part limited series about Roger Ailes, the founder of Fox News which focuses on the past decade when Ailes arguably became the Republican Party's de facto leader, and the sexual harassment accusations that brought his career to an end you will still enjoy Bombshell . I'm sure then you will want to see Russell Crowe in his Golden Globe winning portrayal of slimebag Roger Ailes.It was so interesting seeing Nicole Kidman in Bombshell cast as Gretchen Carlson and comparing her performance to her great friend Naomi Watts who was also cast as Gretchen Carlson the woman who at first was the lone whistle blower on Roger Ailes sexual predatory behaviour. It ended Ailes power and career and rocked Rupert Murdoch's Fox News Empire to its foundations. Later when Gretchen 'S credibility and claims were proven by other victims of Roger Ailes sexual harassment it set the ball rolling towards what we know today as #MeToo . Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts both compare very well indeed in their roles as Gretchen.
Nicole Kidman has a larger role in the movie ,which is appropriate as Bombshell focuses on the women not so much the man.It would be difficult to decide which actresses would be nominated for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress nominations I was so impressed with all of them.Charlize Theron as Megan Kelly the FoxNews anchorwoman who Donald Trump tweeted ""There was blood coming out of her eyes ,blood coming out of her wherever ""and called her a bimbo"" looks amazingly like her character and I think is possibly the most beautiful and one of the most talented actresses in films today .Charlize is great in this film she's the conduit between the Gretchen Carlson and Margot Robbie story lines and she guides the audience like a tour guide through Fox News Studios.
Australian actress Margo Robbie is wonderful again as Kayla Pospisil the new girl on the block at Fox News who gets caught up in Roger Ailes spiders web and eventually almost steals the movie in the telephone box scene.Nicole Kidman should also be nominated as Best Supporting Actress in my opinion,she is just as important and impressive as Margot Robbie.
I often hear friends say I'm not really a Nicole fan I can't see why ? Her roles especially recent ones like the mother in Boy Erased , Celeste Wright in Big Little Lies and now as Gretchen Carlson are so impressive, she is certainly one of the greatest film star exports Australia has ever had and right up there with Cate Blanchett and now Margot Robbie.Sets costumes production and editing are all impressive in Bombshell and Director Jay Roach who directed a favourite film of mine Trumbo in 2015 set in 1947, about Dalton Trumbo who was Hollywood's top screenwriter at the time of McCarthy and the blacklisting has directed an impressive movie perhaps not with the impact of another favourite 2015 movie Spotlight that portrays another true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.
Nonetheless Bombshell 'S portrayal of true events are just as historically significant and just as important to tell.",Bombshell
93,brankovranjkovic,Bombshell - Exploitation of women in the workplace everywhere!,7,18 January 2020,"Drama based on the actual scandal at FOX News in 2016.Starring Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, and Margot Robbie, based on events where the head of the news division at the time (Roger Alies) was embroiled in numerous sexual harassment cases, very much similar to what's going on in Hollywood at the moment with Harvey Weinstein. You can't help drawing the same comparison when you see the scene where John Lithgow (Alies) needs to get about using a walking frame.The movie asks, ""Will sexual harassment always be a hot topic in large organisations where the workforce is made up of powerful men and vulnerable women!""

94,Alexander_Blanchett,Room for improvement,7,9 January 2020,"It was a decent film about power, the abuse of power and regaining power out o different perspectives. It is a shocking true story out of the ""Me too"" era. But here is the problem. The film is a true story and from th very beginning states that a lot of it is changed for dramatic reasons. Well, the thing is many of the scenes feel exaggerated and even cartoonish at times, and so appear some of the characters, mind you not the leading ones, thank god (although Nicole Kdman's Gretchen is coming close to that). I mostly blame director Jay Roach for that as I feel he was not the right person for that job. There are strengths in the screenplay but the execution was kind of poor at times. Also there were just too many stereotypes walking around (and yes this also applies now to the leading characters ) . Peformance wise Charlize Theron is without any doubt the most outstanding one. She had so much strength, self confidence and power in her role that she commanded every single scene she was in. Also it is one of the most charismatic performances of the year. Kudos for Theron who is finally back with an amazing performance. I already mentioned that I didn't like the way they presented Nicole Kidman's character, and I am honest here, even as a big Kidman fan, I felt that part of that was also her performance which I didn't like too much. In fact I thought she was the weakest link in the cast. Margot Robbie is also good but a tard little bit overrated. She had one sensational scene though which undoubtely stays in my mind. Also she was extremely charismatic like Theron, but played too much with that innocent and ignorant girl stereotype. Still Robbie is memorable and deserves most of the love she is getting. I really loved John Lithgow and dont understand he is not getting more attention for his performance as Roger Ailes. He nailed it. Nice support by Allison Janeny and Kate McKinnon. Good soundtrack and costume design. Wished it had a better direction in general.",Bombshell
95,CANpatbuck3664,Bombshell is Well Made and Well Acted Even if it Could Have Punched Harder,8,9 January 2020,"The world today still has a hard time addressing this subject. There is no place for sexual harassment in the workplace from men or women but despite #MeToo and the recent upheaval of several prominent entertainers or businessmen, this remains and uncomfortable and taboo subject. Instead of picking the low hanging fruit, Bombshell looks at these actions from different perspectives and different viewpoints. Its clear who the hero and villains are but we get a peek behind the scenes of the politics and how the shifting priorities from the public affect how these events are seen and covered by the news. It was refreshing and I credit the creative team for not just wagging the finger but taking the time to show the lasting effects of this abuse and the decision making about when to go public and when to sign the NDA. My expectations had to shift along with the movie and it was a pleasant detour from where I was figuring Bombshell was going to go.Bombshell doesn't lack for top flight cast, we get a few huge stars in the leading roles and the supporting cast is populated with some really great character actors and actresses. Charlize Theron is really the lead here, I don't have a lot of experience with Megan Kelly but Theron puts forth a very committed yet restrained performance. She portrays Kelly as very calculating, a victim of the times and of a predatory boss but someone who knows what's at stake and is very aware of her part to play. She's great and although I wouldn't say its her best, it doesn't diminish her work in Bombshell. Robbie gets the next most, I've always been a fan of hers and she's doing solid and capable work here. She's very vulnerable but she draws you into her character's heart-wrenching plight. Theron does the most notable work here but Robbie doesn't get enough credit for her ability. Kidman is a pro, she's dressed down here and like Theron she has a veil of civility in front of her rage. To tell you that she does good work shouldn't be breaking news. John Lithgow is the heavy here, his portrayal of Ailes is deservedly repulsive. Lithgow does a superb job of rotating between ignorant blowhard to misogynistic creep. Ailes accomplished many things but Lithgow makes Ailes easy to hate in spite of his accomplishments, so he got the job done. I had a surprise favourite and least favourite performance. I've never been a big fan of Kate Mckinnon (I never saw her on TV but I hated Masterminds, the Ghostbusters reboot and Ferdinand) but she was pitch perfect here. She's funny when it calls for her to be funny and she's pretty emotional in the dramatic moments. My least favourite was Rob Delaney who was fan favourite character Peter in Deadpool 2. He might have been a victim of a wishy-washy character but I just didn't get a lot of conviction out of his performance and it fell flat for me.Bombshell doesn't have many obvious flaws and that may be what's the most glaring thing I noticed when watching it. This movie has a lot to say about an uncomfortable subject that has been bungled time and time again. It's great, a discussion hopefully leads to progress but I was hoping for a biting, vicious commentary on this subject and instead I got a pretty solid drama. I kept wishing it would take more chances or gravitate more towards something like the Big Short (it apes that style in the beginning a little but it vanishes by the 1/3 mark). But while I credit the creative team for being less biased and taking things in from different sides on this debate, it also made the movie feel less relevant. Its still pretty good but I couldn't help but wonder if Adam McKay or someone with that sensibility would have turned this up a notch (coincidentally the screenwriter penned The Big Short and this movie).Bombshell is a movie that's easy to recommend. I saw this with my sister and listening to her talk about her experiences in the workplace on the drive home, I gained a little perspective. I may never have to go through this kind of humiliation, but its important to empathize with the victims of this kind of assault. Bombshell humanizes and explains this struggle in a way that we can all understand. Its well acted and has an important message to deliver in these fraught climate. I wish it would have taken more chances but that doesn't detract from Bombshell's solid and well meaning cautionary tale. I liked it enough to recommend seeing it in theatres and if its already rotated out of your local multiplex, catch it on your preferred streaming service when it hits that medium.",Bombshell

100,andrewroy-04316,"While it's not a nuanced portrait and is a bit uneven, 3 great lead performances and a powerful main idea mostly overshadow Bombshell's flaws",7,8 January 2020,"It's certainly not a revelatory piece of the increasingly popular modern political docudrama genre, but it is worthwhile. The film tells the story of 3 women at differing points in their Fox News careers (current star, former star, and future star) and how they came forward about their harassment at the hands of Roger Ailes. All three women (particularly Kelly) are shown in a consistently positive light, which honestly didn't bother me as I don't know any of them well and thought the focus was more on the complexity of power dynamics especially in a conservative news environment than their characters. They were pretty simple characters, which isn't the fatal flaw many make it out to be but also certainly isn't a strength. Ailes is obviously a cartoonishly evil dude, and fair enough given the truth of what he's done. Where the movie is most interesting is in considering the unique position that these women are in: women in a very conservative environment, with personal politics playing an essential role in their success (so power dynamics are central to their stories), which leads to fear that perpetuates this system. The feminist story of having the courage to speak up in the toxic, victim-shaming public culture that has existed for decades is great, but the extra layer of it happening in a conservative TV setting makes it more compelling as female expectations are even more concrete. Theron is definitely solid as the lead and does disappear into Megyn Kelly, but Robbie was better (her scene over the phone where she admits she gave in hit hard), and Kidman, who I've seen no talk about, stole the show for me. She was only given so many scenes, and the script plays her up as particularly intelligent and unafraid to be honest, but her strong front as she weathers the storm of Ailes and then goes to her family and can barely keep it together was devastating. A subtle performance, and it's clearly Kelly's story for whatever reason, despite Carlsen being the one to lead the charge, but Kidman was a major strength. I didn't know what to make of the tone - the cinematography and score both felt off, as the script played the story serious but the lighting was so bright and score upbeat. Perhaps Roach was looking to juxtapose the struggles of the women with the Fox News facade that everything is great, but it only undermines some of the seriousness of office scenes with Kelly and Kayla. A solid film with an interesting setting for an important subject that touches all of our culture, and the performances keep it enjoyable throughout.",Bombshell

102,sweidman-28016,"It's Not About Fox News Being Bad, It's About Sexual Assault",7,13 January 2020,"Bombshell Review:Welcome to really late movie reviews with Sawyer since he has a busy life. Today we'll be covering what I'd consider this years Vice kind of movie, Bombshell. This Jay Roach depicts a group of women that take on Fox News head Roger Ailes and the toxic atmosphere he presided over at the network. The writer, Charles Randolph, also wrote the Academy Award winning screenplay for The Big Short so it also has that sort of vibe. Now for you republicans who are reading this, no this isn't a movie that is bashing Fox News. It is nowhere near that. There's a few political statements about president Trump and some derogatory remarks he made towards Megyn Kelly, played by the wonderful Charlize Theron, and some hostility from some republicans who were very against her. So to make this clear, this movie isn't about bashing Fox News. It's about the Roger Ailes incidents where he sexually abused women. Some people have just been giving this bad reviews because they're so set on the idea that it's about how Fox News is bad even when they haven't seen it. I think this is a good depiction of the story and brings awareness on the subject. Earlier in 2019, the Golden Globe winning limited series The Loudest Voice depicted this same story with Roger Ailes. I never saw it but I know it's supposed to be good. What's different with this story from what I know is the women it focused on. Theron, Robbie, and Kidman do an excellent job with this movie. The acting was never bad at all. From the trailer, everybody was freaking out about Theron and how much she looked like Megyn Kelly. This is a for sure lock for winning best hair and makeup at the Oscars in my opinion. They did wonderfully. Theron was perfect at portraying Megyn. The voice, look, and just everything was just very good. I'd hope she'd receive an acting nomination for the Academy Awards like at the Golden Globes. I'd say the same for Margot Robbie. She plays a fictionalized character, Kayla, that's stands for the woman who were abused by Ailes. We see the horrible things that he did to her and she has such a powerful performance. The scene where she goes in his office and he abuses her was horrible to watch. Not saying they did it wrong, they did it completely right and it just angered me so much that someone would do that. This is a good movie if you want to get angry. Robbie received a Globe nomination and I think she could get an Academy nomination as well. Lastly of the women is Kidman. She portrays Gretchen Carlson who eventually brought light to the situation to take down Ailes. Another powerful performance from her. She's angry about how mistreated she was at Fox because ""she's not pretty enough"" and based on appearance. Kidman hasn't been getting that much recognition from her performance in here like Theron and Robbie but I thought she was wonderful and maybe a potential acting candidate. Then there's John Lithgow playing Roger Ailes. He does play a good asshole. I've never really seen much interviews or anything with Roger Ailes personally so I don't know what he sounds like but I know what he looks like and Lithgow went through quite a transformation like Theron for this role. Voice-wise he sounded basically like himself but the acting was good. I don't know about a nomination here. Russell Crowe just won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Ailes so I'm interested to see how the two performances compare. The acting is very good in the movie. The setup was a little odd. It took a little to get into it. At the beginning there's breaking of the fourth wall and I thought the movie would continue to do that and I hoped it would since it worked well but it was only for the first little bit. I think maybe they should've just eliminated that portion and have the movie find a way to explain what they were showing. The pacing was also weird at points where it would randomly slow down. It would always find a way to make it back to maintaining a good pace though. I liked the editing in this for some reason. Its probably because it's the writer of The Big Short and it reminded me of that. Also the score, which is apart of the Oscar shortlist, is interesting and it fit very well with the movie. Overall I think Bombshell is a good movie. Not quite the best of the year but deserves higher reviews than critics are giving it. People need to look past the fast that it's main goal isn't to make a political statement about republicans and democrats or whatever you are. It's just a depiction of a topic that needs to be brought to light more. We've had another limited series come out earlier this year about sexual assault and rape called Unbelievable and that did a fantastic job with the depiction. Some things just need to be talked about since they're serious.My Grade: B+",Bombshell

104,bbewnylorac,A well executed film,8,31 January 2020,"An excellent cast, great script and an A Grade cast make this a really good film about sexual harassment in TV news. Charlize Theron is perfect as the genial but supremely confident news anchor Megyn Kelly. I love how she narrates the first scenes to introduce us to everyone. We see how Kelly has a lot of power, but when she hears about the allegations about her boss, Roger Ailes, she has to decide whether she's prepared to back the accusers. I.e. ""to be or not to be"". But she's not perfect - there's a scene, where she complains that she might lose her salary and lifestyle, where it's hard for me to be sympathetic. She's under pressure, but let's put things in perspective: she's hardly struggling financially.
As Gretchen Carlson, who claims that Ailes sacked her for rejecting his advances, Nicole Kidman has a thankless role - she comes across as a bit sour and brittle. Margot Robbie does well as the naive young producer Kayla who gets a lesson in life when Ailes is sleazy towards her. Kayla makes the point that if Megyn didn't report being sexually harassed years ago, it perpetuates the problem for women in future. Ailes, portrayed by John Lithgow gives a great performance as Ailes, as having an astute grasp of the news business - so he's not stupid, just a sleaze.
Great support work is provided by Kate McKinnon as Kayla's producer friend who at Fox has to stay in the closet as a lesbian. Also Alison Janney is convincing as Ailes's sharp lawyer. The scene with her, Ailes and Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch and his sons is an amusing look into Murdoch's way of operating: i.e. Ailes is a liability but gets a $65 million farewell cheque, while the compensation paid to many women who were harassed totals $50 million.

Because the film approaches the matter from three perspectives it should have been a TV series rather then a movie because we just quickly go from one person to another without much details, then to another news story, and so on. That is why it feels so rushed. The female heavyweight cast (C. Theron, N. Kidman, M. Robbie) did not make an impression, because they all have so much similarities from hair styles and make-up to facial expressions. Actually it is male character (J. Lithgow) who steals the film.

Stand out performance from Theron even thou I didn't watch Fox News way back in her Fox & Friends days the coincidence for me is the thing that got me into American Politics in a big way was the Fox GOP primary debate that Kelly moderates. I was flicking through during insomnia at that infamous moment in time.I started to watch Fox News with utter disbelief at their crazy madhatter approach to conspiracy theory this and a total bias to the GOP and leaning Trump. Apart from Kelly and Brett Bier .So I even started to look on Twitter and open up an account, these events did have an effect on my life. Didn't shock me that the man ultimately in bed with Trump would behave in such a way.However I still despise the Murdochs and I think there is some clean up from what they knew etc. Rupert who got Maggie reelected in Britain after ripping the heart out of the Northern industry then came back and killed rugby league for that he will always be a villain in my books.But a great film , way better than a 6 but then again it's more suitable for the #MeToo gang than the #Trump group who are as of now crying .One bad point Rudy is portrayed as almost human, even coherent when as we all know he is a cock fondling , xenophobic, graveyard dripping head who has an obsession with his cousin (vinny)Well worth it.",Bombshell

111,Magow-Intermean,Bombshell Review,9,30 January 2020,"The loathsome Roger Ailes, notorious as a former Nixon apparatchik and veteran CEO of the stridently mediocre Fox News channel, became even less fragrant in 2016 when the open secret of his sexual harassment became an open non-secret. The channel's former anchor Gretchen Carlson successfully filed a lawsuit against him, revealing that he made sexual advances to her and other women at Fox; their careers would be advanced (or cancelled) at his seedy whim. Carlson's courageous lawsuit was supported by six other women and the 76-year-old Ailes's own boss, Rupert Murdoch, fired his underling, who died a year later.This gruesome soap opera of misogyny and reactionary politics has already been turned into a Showtime TV drama, The Loudest Voice, with Naomi Watts as Carlson and Russell Crowe as Ailes - and now it is a movie directed by Jay Roach and written by Charles Randolph, with Nicole Kidman as Carlson and John Lithgow horribly plausible and latexed up as her bloated old sex-criminal employer. Charlize Theron is Fox News presenter Megyn Kelly, who infuriated the Fox News fanbase by challenging Trump on his anti-women attitudes before the election, and Margot Robbie plays Katya Pospisil, a fictional composite of all the younger women who were abused. She is the ""Christian influencer"" on Instagram who figures she can get ahead at Fox, and submits, almost in a dream, to the humiliation required.
It is a strange film in some ways, speckled with powerful, insightful moments but also with some strained acting, pulled punches and fudged attitudes, unable to decide if its heroines are compromised through having been loyal Fox staffers. Ailes is the obvious villain but Murdoch (still alive, with lawyers and power in the media world) is almost presented as the good guy, finally intervening to create a happy ending and played in cameo by Malcolm McDowell. Despite the film's title, the Carlson/Ailes lawsuit was not a bombshell in the way the Harvey Weinstein revelations were a year later. This may have been because Ailes's accuser was no feminist, and was for years fully on board with the aggressively boorish and sexist attitudes of Fox News.
As for Kelly, the film uses some narrative sleight of hand to suggest that she joined forces with Carlson, when it fact she appears to have limited her support to reporting her own harassment from Ailes in an internal investigation.
Where Bombshell succeeds is in showing how the predatory and sinister abuse plays out in the corporate environment - in bullying. The film shows that sexual harassment and bullying are not separate issues but part of the continuum of coercion. It sketches out a queasy scenario in which a younger female journalist is taken out for a drink by a male boss who brutally asks for sex in return for career advancement, and the film shows how the aghast woman's instinct is to forgive this man, to pretend it isn't happening, even to apologise: ""I'm sorry if I've given you the impression that our relationship could be anything but professional...""Carlson and Kelly are the male-bully victims and there is a truly toe-curling scene in which Carlson, already demoted to an afternoon slot for complaining about on-air bantz from her grisly male co-hosts, presents a ""no cosmetics"" show. Ailes crassly blunders into the studio and shouts at her in front of the crew, screaming that no one wants to see a middle-aged woman sweating. Humiliated, Carlson can only riposte: ""Thank you for the advice!"" - and Kidman powerfully shows her rage.I found Theron's performance as Kelly a little studied and mannered, but again she powerfully shows the same power dynamic. When male inadequates no longer find a woman in the workplace attractive or susceptible to condescension, they bully and demean her, and Ailes revoltingly allowed Donald Trump to do this to Kelly via Twitter, partly because Trump was a ratings star and partly because Ailes not-so-secretly agreed with the future president. The unexpressed irony of this movie is that the president, a serial non-respecter of women, detonated his own explosion of cynical bigotry. The rubble has yet to be cleared away.",Bombshell

Of course, the stars of the show here are Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie. Each actress does an admirable job trying to adopt the mantras and mannerisms of their characters, with Theron perhaps upstaging the other two just a bit (although the performances earned both Theron and Robbie nominations for best supporting actress).The film plays an unmistakable homage to another ripped from the headlines film - 'The Big Short' - thanks to the talents of writer Charles Randolph. It's as fast paced as a yellow cab and has plenty of drama, including some uncomfortable moments that are hard to watch, but 'Bombshell' cannot be written off as a Fox News hit piece. It tells a real, raw story that encapsulates the reality of the #MeToo movement within the media - an experience that was shared by too many women who worked for so many companies and networks across the industry who had to tolerate mistreatment for way too long.While it's not a fun or feel-good story, 'Bombshell' should be viewed as a commentary on this difficult yet important moment in our society.",Bombshell

120,jayjaycee,Narratively flawed but extremely important statement,7,4 February 2021,"""Bombshell"" is a 2019 biopic and political drama directed by Jay Roach starring Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman.
⚪
All in all, Jay Roach's political drama detonates with an enormous explosiveness and appropriate cynicism, as it exposes the vicious power plays, the shocking male dominance in the news television business, as well as the problematics of sexual allegations from women unreservedly, not shying away from depicting the uncomfortable truths and tragic side-effects of the topic at all, and thanks to powerful performances by its three leading ladies (especially by Robbie) it becomes a solid yet lacklustre, and at times narratively unexciting and shallow statement about the #metoo debate, but an extremely necessary wake-up call for the world to realise that sexual harassment indeed exists.
⚪
After a long observation of my recently purchased films, I thought it would be great to kick off the month with a newer and important title. The only thing I knew about this movie was that it was nominated for three Oscars last year and won one of them for best make-up, but after that my knowledge about the subject matter ended. ""Trumbo"" director Jay Roach took on a comparatively new scandal that occurred only a few years back and fictionalised the disgraceful downfall of the prominent CEO of the conservative network, Roger Ailes, after he was accused of sexual harassment by a number of women who have worked for him. Altogether, I can already say at this point that is an undeniably solid film with lots of aspects that make it great, but on the other hand there are also a few ones that keep it from reaching its full potential. First of all, as someone from central Europe and hence an outsider, it was slightly confusing to fully understand the entire film at first. Yes, of course, the gist of what was happening was more than clear, but on the other hand the entire situation wasn't constructed as perfectly as it could have been. Like, I don't know much about liberal and conservative politics in America, especially not which TV network belongs to which camp. It feels extremely muddled in the beginning and becomes even more confusing when it introduces characters at minute intervals, and thinks it is enough when they show their names and what role they play. For Americans that are actually able to make use of all those names, it might be sufficient, but as an onlooker, I wish there was been a little more explanation than that. Furthermore, I am of the opinion that the narration is solid yet at the same time very flawed, as it could have been a lot more packing than it eventually turned out to be. The film depicts its major events in a modest and not thoroughly exciting way and basically moves from plot point to plot without seriously reaching the emotional depth it could have reached. Yes, it scratches on the surface most of the time and hence prevents it from being as shocking as it could have been. Don't get me wrong, it still is upsetting in many sequences, but there is still much left to be desired, and almost frustratingly, it could have been perfect. However, the screenplay rather focusses on processing its key events quickly, and thus the pacing of the film suffers from it a lot - but what is there to expect from a biopic about one of the greatest scandals of the twenty-first century that runs for less than two hours? Sufficient exploration and a decent pace? No, not really, because instead it spends its little time to touch a raw nerve and mercilessly point out the horror of the entire topic - and that is also the main reason why I still don't hate this film. What it lacks in craftsmanship, this film makes up with the message it conveys - and it achieves this almost only with its three leading actresses. Charlize Theron plays the prominent TV show hostess Megyn Kelly superbly and, seriously, looks exactly like her. Next to her, we have Nicole Kidman as her colleague Gretchen Carlson, and last but not least, Margot Robbie as the ambitious Kayla Pospisil. The story behind them goes as follows: After Carlson refused to defer to the disgusting seductions of Roger Ailes, she is at first transferred to a less important show and eventually fired by the network, and since she was no part of FOX anymore, she subsequently sues Ailes for sexual harassment. While it appears that she is the only one at first, more and more women begin to speak up and stand with her, famous hostess Kelly included. In the end, Ailes is fired by the network. However, what initially sounds like a way too simple story is exactly what happened a few years ago - and it depicts the ugliness of this whole situation superbly. It is irrefutably one-sided, but how in the hell are you supposed to depict such a delicate thing from both sides? Anyways, it shows all facets of what happens when a rich and powerful man faces sexual allegations: negations of the accusations, pathetic power plays and assertations of innocence. I know that the law says ""in dubio pro reo"", so the benefit of the doubt, but why do people tend to believe one man and insult one woman when she finally has the courage to speak up and want to seek justice for the traumatising events she has experienced? This is exactly what this film tries to point out. At first, Carlson was ridiculed, called a ""man-hater"", because people said she only sued after being fired, as a part of vengeance or something, but soon after, many other women spoke up as well, one of them being Megyn Kelly herself. This film also illuminates the objectionable procedures of powerful men like Ailes: ""I you want to get ahead, you gotta give a little head."", as the CEO said himself (at least, in this movie). It points out the unfairness and male dominance perfectly: If you want to be successful in the television business as a woman, you have to do what men tell you to do - it is absolutely sick, but it is what really happened. In an uncompromising way, this film points out this hideous dilemma many women in fact face in this business and shows that they are abused if they want to make a career. Exactly this problem led the defenders of Ailes to say that it was always consensual, but let me say at this point, hell no, not in the slightest. Women are tricked into thinking that this is the only way of succeeding, and it is nothing short of deplorable - and this film depicts this problem, emphasising the ugly and unvarnished truth. In scenes in which it is shown that Ailes is harassing females it is downright uncomfortable to watch - but guess what the women in those exact situations must have felt like? Remember, this film is a biopic that, as far as I can judge it, sticks to the truth ... at least for one point. The character of Kayla, outstandingly portrayed by Margot Robbie, is in fact fictional. Wait, a fictional character in a true story? At first, it sounds kind of stupid, I admit it, but later on I realized that Kayla was probably one of the most important characters of the film. Surely, she wasn't real, but what she experiences is real, and that leads me to think that she is some sort of a metaphor. Kayla represents all women that have ever been through such atrocities, and furthermore, her character is one of many - the plot eventually works out without her, Kelly and Carlson are the ones who seal the deal on the case. Does it leave out the Bill O'Reilly scandal and the Kell racism éclat that happened shortly after? Yes, it does, but even if that is definitely not less important, it still would have disturbed the main focus of the film. This isn't a film about Megyn Kelly. This is also no film about Gretchen Carlson. And as crazy as it sounds, this is no film about Roger Ailes either. In the first place, this is a film about women seeking and eventually getting justice. It is a survivor story, and it is so utterly important I cannot even put it in words. The reason this film was made wasn't just to entertain audiences, no, it was made to inspire women who have been through the same and encourage them to speak up, made perfectly clear when Nicole Kidman looks directly into the camera and motivates women to do what is necessary - and that is why I think it's a phenomenal film. In the end, however, I don't celebrate this film for its technical brilliance, because honestly, there is very much to be desired, but I do love it for its powerful message, the acting and the ideas behind it. Those two factors even up each other, and only imagine what would have been if it were better crafted. Anyway, this film is utterly important, nevertheless.",Bombshell
121,zeekwunlau,real and plot,7,1 April 2020,"This is a feminist movie where women are upset by dissatisfaction with sexism and unfair treatment. But with deeper and deeper thinking, this is actually a movie that defends its legitimate rights and interests and challenges high-level people. At first sight, I completely overturned the impression. I even felt a little sorry because I felt that shouting feminism was true. Discrimination-we are all people first, then men and women, and protecting our rights and interests has nothing to do with gender.
Let's talk about the content of the story: media tycoons, sexual harassment, expulsion, litigation, gathering evidence, women's solidarity, victory, the general storyline is the case. When one of the fictional characters, Kayla, came to Megyn's door to verify it, a line he spoke was very interesting:
K-Did you think your silence would mean?
M-Roger is not my fault.
K-It would'd been nice if somebody told us that he 's after more than legs.
M-It 's nobody 's job to protect you, Kayla.
K-That 's all of our job... ..I do n't get you... You have power.Why are you still playing by old rules? You 're Megyn Kelly.
The complaints of young people in the workplace against their predecessors are more extreme. The transparent person in the victim party accuses the celebrity of inaction, which shows in disguise that the injuries suffered by the young people are the superposition of all the victims who chose to remain silent.

Director: Jay Roach
Starring: Charlize Theron, Margot Robbie, Nicole Kidman, Kate McKinnon, John Lithgow, Allison Janney etc.
Overall rating 56/100Bombshell is based on a real-life story of women in fox news standing up against the boss who has sexually harassed many female employees to prove their loyalty, and they work together to destroy him. Bombshell had the potential to be a great movie, but sadly for me was a massive let down and conveyed the complete opposite message to the audience that it was supposed to do. There were some good moments but lets talk about why this movie was such a disappointment for me.First of I must commend the pretty good performances from Charlize, Nicole and Margot. Everyone despite not being given the best material to work with, did a good job with that they had, with Charlize transforming into Megyn Kelly and Margot displaying a very emotional performance further solidifying her acting ability and versatility, and Nicole also portraying these qualities as well.However, my first negative linked to the previous paragraph would be that all three lead actresses were unlikeable. Margot Robbie's character played the stereotypical dumb blonde with no noticeable personality or likeable qualities about her, both Nicole and Charlize's characters were very one dimensional and bland, and just unapproachable making them characters that you didn't support throughout. They were also always contradicting what they were saying making them incredibly irritating.
My next positives would be that there was a good uncomfortable tone set and there was some decent character development. Nicole's character had a decent amount of development within her job of trying to make a difference to her programme by promoting gun safety and women not having to wear makeup, only to be told its not the right thing to be telling women, which only motivated her more to do the show with more of these messages. So this was an interesting little development with her character. And also Charlize's character had the most interesting development within the film, as she stood for what she believed in and wanted to help women everywhere by trying to take down the boss and go against the extreme sexism that Donald Trump was displaying in his presidential campaign, but it was nice to see the development and conflict of her character when her and her family was receiving death threats giving her the debate about whether to protect her family or fight for what she believes in. Bombshell also managed to achieve a very good uncomfortable tone with the boss of fox news Roger Ailes, he consistently asked women to pull up their dresses to show off there legs in order to get jobs in his company leading to you feeling very uncomfortable and his character getting under your skin, but this was the desired passive response that the director wanted so this was executed very well.My next negatives would be that the film didn't want any of the characters to be perceived as feminists, and the films direct narrative and dialogue to the audience was not needed. Throughout the whole film when all the female characters were asked if they were feminists or had a feminist agenda with what they were doing, they all said no. This was a stupid decision, as it was clear throughout the film that the whole reason for the women speaking up was because of feminism and equal rights. So for the film to contradict this was a big turn off for me and a odd decision, as this makes it more difficult for the director to portray the desired message of the film which was not executed well anyway which we will further discuss later. And also, the film had random direct dialogue to the audience with Charlize Theron directly talking to the audience. I did not like this whatsoever, it added nothing to the film, it made the pacing and narrative really clunky and really took you out of the movie.Next the film was fairly funny in places, I will always praise Kate McKinnon's humour in whatever film she is in. As I connect with her funny wit and she always brings a breath of fresh air into whatever movie she is in. And her appearance in this film gave it the much-needed comedic tone it needed.My final two positives would be the films good messages and tackling modern issues of women in the workforce very well. The films message about people with different opinions being toxic was a good message to spread, as everyone has different opinions, and everyone should respect each other's opinions which Bombshell expressed very well. And the political messages about women not wearing make-up was also a fresh message for women and needs to be used more. And the film tackled sexual harassment within the workforce very sensitively and respectfully which was great. Going into detail about different women's experiences that sadly still happen today.However, my final negative for bombshell would be that it completely lost its female empowerment message by displaying so many stereotypes for women. The film either portrayed women as weak or not being able to stand up for themselves, pitting women against each other instead of them all working together as a team. And the unlikeable lead characters made women appear bitter and petty.Overall bombshell had its moments and had the potential to be a great movie. But sadly, it became a big disappoint, with its odd decisions with its narrative and script, and giving the complete opposite message about women then perhaps it intended.",Bombshell
123,gavinp9,Solid biopic with great cast,7,5 February 2020,"'Bombshell' is a 'based on a (recent) true story' film, along the lines of 'The Big Short' (not too surprising, since it has the same writer) or 'Spotlight'. But oddly, it's from the director of 'Austin Powers', 'Meet The Parents' and 'The Campaign'! Given the subject matter, it's not really funny, but is still a gripping story. Megyn Kelly (Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Kidman) and Kayla Pospisil (Robbie) all work for Fox News in 2016, a workplace ripe with sexism, discrimination and harassment.As the saying goes, ""the fish rots from the head down"" - in this case, Roger Ailes (Lithgow) is the head of Fox News and is initially accused by Gretchen for sexual harassment, setting in motion a chain of events which could go either way, as no other women initially come forward with similar stories. The scene with Ailes and Kayla is truly disturbing and hard to watch. Credit to Lithgow for making Ailes an almost-sympathetic character at times and not just an evil caricature. Robbie's great as the naïve Kayla, Kidman's good in her limited scenes, McKinnon is funny and nuanced as Kayla's friend and Theron carries the film, especially as she grapples with what to do with her career on the line.An exceptional group of supporting actors make it interesting and fast-paced - Delany as Megyn's producer, Britton as Ailes' wife, Janney as the lawyer, Duplass as Megyn's husband, Kind as Giuliani, Root as the other lawyer, McDowell as Rupert Murdoch, and Josh/Ben Lawson as James/Lachlan Murdoch. Certainly not a 'fun' film, but it's well acted, filmed and put together. Ending could've used a little work, but is arguably still a work in progress even today.",Bombshell
124,themadmovieman,"Struggles to find its voice early on, but develops into a compelling and fiery contemporary drama",8,8 January 2020,"As contemporary as things get, Bombshell is a gripping and energetic exposé on a horrifyingly pervasive issue in modern society, providing captivating and fiery drama along with well-tempered social commentary and historical intrigue. The film does struggle to find its voice early on, but with real passion and immense talent in all corners, it ultimately proves to be a powerful and attention-grabbing watch.If there's one thing to know about Bombshell, it's that it doesn't hold its punches. And that's what really makes it soar. It's by no means a hysterical or melodramatic take on real issues, and it impresses throughout with well-balanced and level-headed drama, but its passion and fire are what really turn it from an average film into something both more memorable and worth your while.There's no getting away from the main topic at play here, sexual harassment and institutional pressure on women to stay quiet about it. Bombshell details the high-profile scandal surrounding Fox News CEO Roger Ailes' fall from grace, and does so in an unapologetically direct and passionate manner.In its early stages, however, Bombshell doesn't get off to the best of starts, misguidedly focusing on a number of topics that frustratingly dilute the real impact of what's really at stake. Set sparingly against the initial stages of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, the film starts off with too much emphasis on the conservative-liberal divide, Trump's campaign and the cutthroat world of news media.Both of those topics are certainly a key part in the history of institutional sexual harassment in the modern day, but in terms of telling this story, Bombshell spends far too long on wider topics without linking into its strongest suit, where the real ire and intensity lies.What's more is that the first act tries to play the same sharp and witty fourth-wall breaking game of The Big Short. But, in tandem with its misguided thematic focus at first, Bombshell just doesn't have the same spark or even humour to be another Big Short, and really struggles to find its voice for the best part of the first forty minutes.All of that changes, however, when the story takes a marked shift in tone and focus. The contemporary political background is left to one side (and not really picked up again), but it's all for the better, as the film begins to deliver a powerful exposé on sexual harassment, all the while getting you fired up as its reveals the disgusting realities of how executives pressure and silence those trying to show the truth to the world.From there on in, Bombshell is far less of a rehash of The Big Short, but more reminiscent of a revelatory news report, much like the excellent Spotlight. And with that more serious and assured tone, there comes real dramatic gravitas, shocking political themes, and most of all an infuriating portrayal of revolting and medieval behaviour by a respected and successful media magnate.And beneath all of that beats a fiery heart of righteous fury, just waiting to be given the chance to speak out and show the real truth. The film's opening act never feels passionate enough, but its latter stages are the exact opposite, working both as a level-headed political drama and an impassioned call to arms on exposing the pervading institutional terrors of sexual harassment.It's a film that really gets you fired up for its cause, and that speaks volumes about just how gripping it is come the finish. That fire and emotion is delivered brilliantly on screen by a whole host of great performances, particularly from the enthralling Charlize Theron and the villainous Jon Lithgow, and it all comes together to make Bombshell a compelling and genuinely powerful watch in the end.Overall, I was really impressed by Bombshell. While it misses the mark in its early stages, attempting to grab your attention with sharp wit and a range of subject matters, it improves enormously later on. Feeling like an entirely different film after its first act, it provides an enthralling and infuriating exposé on institutionalised sexual harassment, complete with riveting depth and immense passion both in front of and behind the camera.",Bombshell

The film is about the biography of the American journalist Megyn Kelly a woman who went against wrong sexist remarks made by leading men such as Donald Trump.In the film, Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) works at Fox News of which Roger Alies (John Lithgow) is the boss. He does this in a corrupt way and uses his power to sexually intimidate women. If he also abuses his power against Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie), he advises her not to mention this if she wants to keep her job. Despite this threat, Kayla seeks help from her colleagues and hears that something similar has happened to Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman). The three women decide to work together and engage in political struggle against their corrupt boss.This film responds well to the topicality of the MeToo movement where women stand up for their rights and oppose the sexual cross-border behavior of men who are above them. Megyn Kelly was one of the most important women who supported and appealed to other women to report sexual misconduct. Megyn Kelly dared to go against someone like Donald Trump and managed to make followers and fans, but due to other comments from her that she had about Santa not only having a white version, she lost supporters again. Gretchen Carlson actually tried to play a greater role in the MeToo movement. For this film they have adjusted the roles a bit and make Megyn Kelly look more like a hero, because they don't play much on her lesser sides. Margot Robbie plays a fiction character in the film, which is meant to symbolize all women who have been sexually intimidated by men who are above them. Despite the changes and additions they have made to the film, the message from the film still sounds good. Charlize Theron and Margot Robbie are also justly nominated for the Oscar for best female head and supporting role. In addition to these Oscars, the film is rightly nominated for the Oscar for best makeup and hairstyles, because they have managed to change Charlize Theron and John Lithgow in such a way that they look more like the characters they play and can hardly be recognized. to be.",Bombshell

132,Bertaut,A well-acted film about the human cost of bullying and sexual harassment,8,4 February 2020,"Although it lacks subtlety and factual insight, Bombshell is entertaining, brilliantly acted, and paints a horrifying picture of workplace bullying and sexual harassment. Sure, it'll be yet more evidence for the right that leftist Hollywood is incapable of partiality, but really, if you're the type of person prone to believing the propaganda machine that is Fox News, what are you even doing watching this film in the first place?The story begins in August 2015 during the first Republican presidential debate when Fox New host Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) asks candidate Donald Trump about his history of misogynistic comments. In a CNN interview the following day, Trump claims ""you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever"". And so, much to her chagrin, Kelly finds herself the focus of the headlines. Initially, Fox News president Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), supports her, but as time goes on, he begins to grow concerned about her attitude. Meanwhile, in June 2016, Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), is fired from the channel, having already complained about sexist treatment in 2013. Hiring a legal team, she intends to sue not Fox, but Ailes personally, who she claims sexually harassed her for years. However, the suit can only be successful if others are willing to corroborate her claims. Elsewhere, ""millennial evangelical"" Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie playing a composite character) is hired as a research assistant, and is horrified when she discovers exactly what Ailes means when he says he will need evidence of her ""loyalty"".Written by Charles Randolph and directed by Jay Roach, Bombshell is the third major retelling of the Ailes saga in the last couple of years, following Divide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailes (2018) and The Loudest Voice (2019). The events of the film preceded the first accusations against Harvey Weinstein (October 2017) and the birth of the #MeToo movement by over a year, and the depiction of the nature of sexual harassment in a corporate arena that's male-dominated and female-enabled (many of the female employees of Fox proudly wear ""I stand with Roger"" t-shirts) is chillingly effective, with the film depicting an environment in which women are victims whether they resist or submit to sexual advances - resist, and they risk their job; submit, and they lose their self-respect.At the same time, Roach is not trying to examine the monolithic political ideology of Fox News itself. Sure, it features lines such as Ailes claiming, ""news is like a ship, you take your hands off the wheel and it pulls hard to the left"", whilst Pospisil is told the main goal of the channel is to ""frighten and titillate"", but these are the exceptions. Roach knows that 99% of his audience will already agree that Fox News is a hate-filled, xenophobic, propaganda machine, so he makes little effort to depict the network's political leanings. Instead, the film is about self-loathing, fear, and anxiety - it's about workplace bullying and the human cost of sexual harassment.This is a crucial point, because the three women at the film's centre (Kelly, Carlson, and Pospisil) are not a rebellious group of bra-burning feminists, they not even friends (the trio share only a single scene, and it's without dialogue). They're right-wing conservatives who helped create the system under which they now find themselves oppressed. However, part of the film's point is that politics are irrelevant - sexual harassment is sexual harassment, and your politics, religious beliefs, race, and gender are all beside the point. This is not an anti-Republican diatribe. It's the exposé of a man who was a Republican.Aesthetically, Bombshell is a strange creature. The rapidly edited, stylistically hyperactive first half-hour or so is more akin to Adam McKay's dramas or 90s Oliver Stone. For example, one of the earliest scenes sees Theron break the fourth wall and address the audience as she gives us a tour of Fox News. Another moment sees Pospisil being told that some people watch the channel so much, the logo has burnt onto their TV screens, at which point the Fox logo appears in the corner of the screen. However, once the groundwork has been laid, Roach shifts tones completely and moves into fairly standard factual drama territory, which has the effect of making the first act feel somewhat isolated and incongruous.Something that works well, however, is the triptych narrative structure. It's not an even divide (this is Kelly's film before it is Carlson's or Pospisil's), but it does allow Roach to dramatise just how much Ailes looks on his female staff as commodities. Carlson is the washed-up former beauty queen who no longer holds his interest; Kelly is the current flavour of the month, still beautiful, still popular; Pospisil is the future, young, vital, keen, and in awe of the man himself, as all women should be - for every Carlson, there's a Kelly to replace her, and for every Kelly, there's a Pospisil ready for grooming.From an acting perspective, there's not a weak link, with Theron especially impressive. Normally, she looks nothing like Kelly, but through posture, mannerisms, wardrobe, voice, and the subtle prosthetic genius of Kazu Hiro, the actress disappears into the character, who she plays as steely and often remote, but fiercely passionate and intelligent. It's still a deeply impressive performance that transcends mere imitation.The other standout is Lithgow, whose performance is fascinatingly modulated. Introduced in a scene designed to show his fatherly protective side, he initially portrays Ailes as a flawed human being, and it's only later that he lets the monster out of the box. One particular scene, which is the dark heart of the film, sees him asking an increasingly uncomfortable Pospisil to hike her skirt higher and higher, to the point where her underwear becomes visible, as he becomes increasingly aroused, indicated by nothing but his breathing. It's an exceptionally nauseating scene which gets to the film's core - Ailes knows that if women like Pospisil value their job, they'll submit, just as they have done for men like him throughout history. As he sees it, ambitious women will always need powerful men, and he behaves as he deems appropriate within such a paradigm.As for problems, the film is probably too silent on some of Kelly's history. I understand where Roach is coming from on this; to feature scenes which seem designed to depict her in a less than favourable light could run perilously close to victim-blaming. But whilst I agree in principle, I think that in practice, Roach errs in the other direction. If you knew nothing about these events, you'd be forgiven for thinking the only controversy Kelly ever encountered at Fox was asking Trump about misogyny. There's no mention, for example, of her infamous ""Jesus was a white man"" comment from 2013. Granted, it doesn't have much to do with the story at hand, but my point is a general one. The film's Kelly is almost virginal, without blemish. Making her character more rounded, more flawed, would have served both the character and the story, and actually helped rather than hindered Roach's argument that politics don't matter in relation to sexual harassment. Interestingly, the film does address that Kelly knew about Ailes for years before Carlson was fired, and it takes her to task for not doing anything with that knowledge. However, after she watched the film, the real Kelly cited this scene as an example of victim-blaming - make of that what you will.Ultimately, Bombshell argues that just because people like Kelly and Carlson elected not to rock the boat earlier in their careers doesn't mean they don't deserve sympathy. Certainly, in the case of Kelly, the opportunity for her to explain why she stayed silent for so long is available, but is never availed of. But is that a fault of the filmmakers or a reflection on the actual person's reluctance to take that particular journey inward? Sure, the film is at pains to avoid showing either Carlson or Kelly as in any way complicit in creating the hideously outdated patriarchy at Fox. But this is by design. Were Bombshell a story about Fox News, such things ought to be examined. But it isn't. It's a story about humiliation and bullying, a story that says people do not deserve such treatment, no matter their race, religion, or politics.",Bombshell

135,Lewis_Heather787,Three Terrific Performances !,7,29 December 2019,"I can tell already that this film is gonna be controversial, due to the nature of the subject matter. Politics these days is extremely tribal so depending on your political beliefs and your opinion of the women coming out..........that is probably going to determine your view on the film. Unfortunately I can see a scenario where some people will either not watch this outright because of those reasons or go into watching it hating it before they've seen it. Sad but true !Now viewing this from a far, I'm not an American and I don't live in the US, there was a little research or catching up I had to do before viewing this. So I was a bit more familiar with Fox News and the personalities portrayed in the film........some of who I already knew about and had seen/heard their opinions on news in recent years. I would implore anyone out there to do the same before seeing this because I think it would benefit your viewing experience of the film. The film just shoves you straight into the story basically assuming you know or have heard of everyone in the film.............so it could be confusing if you don't know much.For me overall I really enjoyed the film, I think the directing and pace of the film are really good, the film definitely has a nice flow to it. Surprisingly even though the film is dealing with a truly horrifying and dark subject matter, the film is not a drag or overly dark all the time. Nice uses of levity to balance the film, which is definitely needed. Personally though the reasons that anyone should watch this film is firstly, to understand and to be exposed to the horror of the sexual misconduct allegations against Roger Ailes. There are a lot of surprising and detailed elements that are uncovered which are shocking and truly disturbing, you don't quiet realise how much of it was either covered up or normalised behaviour at the time. It was the secret that pretty much everyone working there knew about but never spoke about............it was an environment of pressure, power and intimidation.......to think this is very recent is even more gut wrenching.The other reason to see this film are the three main performances which all three of them are just fantastic. Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie all are unbelievably good in the film. All of the characters have similar attributes and goals they want to achieve but definitely have their own problems they are dealing with or are hiding. It only takes one small fire or one person to come out and that starts the wildfire..............it is truly fascinating to watch the rise and fall in each of the characters relationship with Fox News the company.Overall I think the film was really intriguing to see the lid lifted on what really went on behind closed doors...................well at least what the film depicts, how much of it is accurate??? how much of it did happen??? what did the film not show?? They are all genuine questions that people have to bare in mind not matter your political or personal opinion on the film. Can any political film be neutral??? I'm pretty positive the film is truthful. 75% out of 100 its good.......almost really good but not quite.",Bombshell

The message it delivers is important and it's fairly well-paced and captivating, albeit horrifying (once you think about how all of this is based on real stories).Most of the negative reviews for this movie are sexist old men or incels who are weirdly infuriated at a movie being made about sexual assault.

I thought this was going to be one of those films that the Oscars love, but after watching it I can't say that. The major thing that took that away was the cinematography. The characters would like right at the camera and talk like in Parks And Recreation. It was just annoying because they really only did it at the start if the film. The acting was really good I thought. Margot Robbie gave a great performance along with Nicole Kidman. Charlize Theron tried taken on an accent. I thought she sounded like garbage. She sounded like Siri on an Apple Phone. Her words meant nothing to you even when she was giving a big statement. I don't know why she was nominated for an Oscar. She could walk around fine. That isn't worthy of an Oscar though. Besides her everybody else did good. John Lithgow did pretty good in this movie. It was hard to dislike his character because most of the time he is the charming guy that you feel bad for. In this film he was the main bad guy but it was hard not to like him. A thing that is worth mentioning and something they should and did win an Oscar for, is the makeup work. You couldn't tell that the main character was Charlize Theron. I didn't know John Lithgow was going to be in this film, but the only way I could tell it was him was by his voice.

151,bastille-852-731547,Disappointing exposé of a truly toxic work culture,5,16 December 2019,"I was hoping that this drama about the sexual harassment that brought down Fox News CEO Roger Ailes would be well-acted and timely. While it contains some solid performances and outstanding makeup work (Theron, Kidman and Lithgow) are unrecognizable,) it is unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. While it's not outright bad like the somewhat-similar-in-tone-and-style ""Vice"" was, it tragically succumbs to many of the same flaws that plagued that film last year.The film uses a lot of choppy editing and often-bizarre narrative techniques, making the story relatively disjointed. Despite these problems, however, the actual presentation of the circumstances behind Ailes' downfall and the prominent women in his inner circle is very paint by the numbers. The script is unfortunately very basic in terms of its attempts at political commentary, and feels just simply like preaching to a choir rather than creating incisive and sharp critiques of Fox News. I was also disappointed that the film didn't really give much thought to critiquing Fox as a cable ""news"" (legally, it is classified as an entertainment channel in the United States and many of its programs are highly ideological) channel. It tries to make some vague connections to how Fox News contributed to now-President Trump's electoral victory in 2016, but does not really connect the dots to show some of the clear ramifications of this in the present day--such as, for example, the slanted views presented on Fox these days over Trump's Ukraine scandal and the current effort in the House of Representatives to impeach him. In order to really understand the ways that Fox has affected civic discourse in the United States, it is necessary to draw at least some parallels. The film also does not know how to fully depict its protagonists, and I also thought that adding a fictional main character to the mix was a bit odd since it is otherwise supposed to be a very true-life story. As a result, this film feels serviceable at times but ultimately very forgettable and bland. Not recommended. 5/10",Bombshell
152,eelen-seth,"Energetic, entertaining and important.",8,14 December 2019,"This bombshell couldn't have dropped at a better time. The #MeToo movement has been in full force for a couple of years now, with victims coming forward and sharing their horrific experiences around sexual harassment. What happened in 2016 at Fox News, gets dramatised to make it more appealing for moviegoing audiences, but at the core of the story is nothing but truth. The horrendous events surrounding the allegations against CEO and Chairman of Fox News, Roger Ailes, are astounding but not surprising after more and more highly regarded and powerful men have been uncovered as sexual predators in the workforce.Jay Roach's (Trumbo) newest drama follows Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Karlson (Nicole Kidman) and Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) at Fox News. When Megyn prepares for the Fox News Debate, where she'll go head to head with the person who'll end up winning the presidential election, Donald Trump, she doesn't shy away from confronting him with his outrageous tweets, in which he objectifies women over and over again. The film almost feels like as if you're watching a documentary, while Megyn takes us on a tour of the Fox News building.A confidently composed Gretchen meets with her lawyers, fed up with the comments here male co-anchors have made over the past couple of years and being demoted by her boss, Roger Ailes (John Lithgow). Her thoughts run through the speakers, while her lawyers ask her to hold on until they have a case to sue Roger and get ready to take down the ""Loudest Voice"" in the room. Kayla, who's been working as an associate producer, is a conservative Christian who believes in a fair and balanced America. But when she gets to visit the infamous second floor, things get uncomfortably disdainful. Many of these women seem to be happy working for Fox News, but the truth is being muzzled. Thriving in a toxic environment seems to be the biggest excuse to stay, but others just can't wait to prepare for the war that results in the ousting of Roger Ailes from the network.The acting ensemble alone is worth the admission. Charlize Theron (Long Shot) transforms into Megyn Kelly, you'd think she's a clone. Her characteristics, facial expressions, the voice, are perfectly under control - it's uncanny. Margot Robbie (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) as Kayla, captures the America the way non-Americans think all US-citizens are. To see her character truly evolve through a traumatic experience, will leave you sympathising for her. She gives one of the finest and delicate performances of her career. When it comes to Nicole Kidman, it seems like Big Little Lies co-star Meryl Streep has rubbed off on her in a way. Her acting is nuanced, as she brings an energetic confidence to the film, many people should applaud.Although the script and direction of Bombshell are somehow a bit basic, the film as a whole gets carried by our main trio of actors and a ton of extras - what a cast. There's some goofy make-up work to resemble some unexpected faces you'll recognise from the news and Australian media magnates Murdoch and sons, are as menacing and cut-through as you'd expect. Bombshell is a must-see for every woman, in any field. Sexual harassment is not a new phenomenon, it's something that should be eradicated and educated everywhere and this film does a phenomenal job at doing just that. Don't worry, it's still entertaining and definitely one of those films that will make people talk for long after.Originally published on intoscreens",Bombshell

Truth is, there are no victims portrayed in this film!Think of a circle of millionaires, who played a game of hustle to grab the brass ring, knowing entirely what they were entering into, and at the end, wanting to keep their cash from the swindle, and then cash in once more by revealing the swindle to a world they presumed was ignorant of the game.Truth is, the idea of the casting couch is as old as Hollywood, and the news media is just another form of Hollywood that reads words from teleprompters. Those casting couches were made in the 1920's and onward to today. Most people long knew that to get ahead in the media world, one had to play favors in various forms.The reason why the acting in this movie can be solid, but the movie fall flat, is because the characters lack empathy due to their real counterparts being willing participants in a scam to make personal fortunes. It's like trying to feel sorry for a pool hustler who himself gets out hustled.Amid this weak premise lies another undeniable purpose, to strike an all too predictable political angle. Blunt truth is that every newsroom in the world is populated by the same people working the same formula. If the message is altered, then it's only to feed a paying audience that lines up for its daily double.This movie fails to satisfy because it tries to portray dishonest people as being honest. The few who actually were honest remain the ones we rarely hear about, who have even more actual news talent, but labor in comparative obscurity because they didn't care enough about wealth and celebrity to peddle their bodies to the highest bidders, Nor, for that matter, would they agree to peddle away the truth, and substitute it with some political messaging masquerading as news reporting.Had the movie the courage to delve into those actual people of integrity, and make them well known names, by showing how they refused to sell out, then we'd have a movie worth seeing. But, the same star power from focusing on household media names, like Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson, simply reminds us that the entire industry operates by the same formula.Ultimately, it's a movie about one group of weasels abusing another group by the same name and pattern. And that reality is why so many walk away from this film thinking the experience empty and shallow in substance.",Bombshell

But every so often we will get one of these good looking women that can actually act. Which is ironic because it is literally what the movie is about, strong women who want to be judged by their character and what they do and not by their looks. A message that can't be repeated enough.
Robbie again steals the show leaving Theron and Kidman in her rear-view mirror even though this in not a competition. There is a certain scene with her and you will know it when you see it where you could hear a needle drop in the audience. After creating the iconic Harley Quinn and her performance in I, Tonya she again and again continues to amaze the audience.Bombshell sends a strong message of standing up against sexual harassment for standing up for yourself and against objectifying women.

171,cappiethadog,An unnatural woman,5,6 January 2020,"""A Woman's Place"", Episode 6 from Season 2 of ""The Handmaid's Tale"", adapted from the Margaret Atwood novel, puts the First Amendment to the United States Constitution under a microscope. ""A Woman's Place"" is highlighted by flashbacks, scenes from a hegemonic shift in the makings. Serena Joy Waterford(Yvonne Strahovski), the commander's wife, grapples with an angry mob of college students unwilling to give the Gilead movement a platform at their campus. These boisterous protesters, and others like them, saw democracy in its death throes before everybody else, and knew that by mainstreaming ultra-conservative advocates such as Serena would only expedite the change in political ideologies. To be fair and balanced, the emcee at the liberal college fights for Serena's constitutional right to share her vision of a fascist theocracy that sanctions systemic rape as a higher calling for potential neo-nuns, the fertile women who are designated to be handmaids. Serena, an extrapolated pro-lifer, saddles lesbians with the appellation ""gender traitor"" without any awareness of the inherent hypocrisy of women like herself subjugating other women to aid men in their devaluation. Color-coded green, as wife to The Commander(Joseph Fiennes), Serena played a part in conceiving the ""ceremony"", a ritualization of forced ****** congress for the greater good; an antidote to declining birth rates. Offred(Elizabeth Moss), color-coded red, lies down in Serena's lap, as The Commander, in clinical fashion, impregnates the designated *** slave without any objection from neither the handmaid herself, a gender victim, nor the architect, a gender traitor. The commander departs, without any indication of a crime having been committed. Mother and ""*****"" are left alone. The mother cries, but tears are not enough. It's the price she has to pay for pledging allegiance to Gilead. Being an accessory to the patriarchy isn't what Serena thought it would be. The mother/***** binary which her policies split in half; she misses it, not realizing at the time that *** and love are interconnected.""My loyalty is to the company."" Gretchen Carlson(Nicole Kidman) looks at Kayla(Margot Robbie), one of her staffers, as if she stabbed her in the heart with a very sharp knife. The ex-""Fox and Friends"" co-host, recently demoted to the less-desirable afternoon time-slot, impresses upon Kayla that she can be her mentor, when Bill O'Reilly's people woos the starry-eyed young woman away. This defection should not come as a surprise to Gretchen. Fox News CEO Roger Ailes(John Lithgow), her boss, prevents the formation of a sisterhood by playing women against each other; a competition he created to see which female touches the glass ceiling first. Working for Bill O'Reilly(Kevin Dorff) in Kayla's estimation, gets her closer to Roger, more so than a woman approaching middle-age whose star at the network is in decline. When the cable news network fires Gretchen Carlson, the ousted anchorwoman looks for other women to come forward and help bolster her sexual harassment lawsuit against Ailes. Megyn Kelly(Charlize Theron), to Gretchen's surprise, would lend this potentially career-killing case the credibility it needed by the host of the Fox's top-rated show coming out with her own allegations. The women were virtual strangers to each other. The deafening silence throughout the elevator scene involving Megyn, Gretchen, and Kayla, is the white noise of patriarchal slavery. ""Wings"", the bonnet that completes a handmaid's regulation uniform, hinders the woman's peripheral vision, in which she sees only what's in front of her. Instead of wings, the female on-air talent have legs, exposed by short skirts, and can relate to each other only as ""jezebels"", competing for the attention of male bosses, colleagues, and viewership. Gretchen rebels, going on-air without makeup, and emancipates herself from within, and then without Fox, when she gets fired and files her class-action lawsuit against Roger Ailes, her commander, who oversees the meat market. Without wings, Gretchen sees Megyn Kelly for the first time as an ally, instead of foe. Although Jay Roach's ""Bombshell"" may not be the film about the controversial cable news network the public wants, it'll have to do in the interim. The filmmaker only half-addresses the elephant in the room, and the zookeepers who defend this mammal from beltway poachers. ""Bombshell"" is about a cable news network whose frat house environment desensitizes its executives to the misogyny that our future president displayed so often on the campaign trail. He's one of us, they thought. They couldn't see the forest for the trees.The ladies get out on the same floor, the second floor; Roger's lair. They disperse in three different directions, predictably, since they're not friends, or even on speaking terms. Faye(Holland Taylor), Roger's administrative assistant, first deals with Gretchen, who bemoans about the time that passed since their last lunch date. This pleasantry lingers in the dead office air for a sister-in-arms-like response, but the amiable utterance dies, turning into ghost words by the time it reaches the pasted-on smile of a real-life gender traitor. Faye doesn't have to say: ""My loyalty is to the company,"" like Kayla, especially when Gretchen sees her former staffer going into Roger's office. The grey-haired secretary not only enables the Fox CEO, she scouts potential ""talent"" for her septuagenarian boss with the walker to sexually harass. ""Doesn't it ever stop?"" Gretchen asks, before she makes her exit. A chance meeting brought the aspiring television personality to Faye's attention. She sized Kayla up, and was deemed pretty enough for a private meeting with her boss. Like Roz(Elizabeth Wilson), Mr. Hart's ""eyes and ears"" in Colin Higgins' ""9 to 5"", Roger Ailes' own eyes and ears, who is old enough to be Kayla's mother, prefers being close to corporeal power over female power, which falls on the side of abstractness at a place where women are regularly objectified on- and off-camera without any consequences. Roz is out of the game. She could care less if Mr. Hart(Dabney Coleman) and Doralee(Dolly Parton) are having an extramarital affair. Being a topical, but ultimately, routine comedy, the 1980 film about secretaries in revolt(Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, and the aforementioned Parton), who orchestrate their male chauvinist boss' removal from his seat of power, lacks the gravitas to label the cartoonish toadie as a bonafide gender traitor. Faye, on the other hand, is evil; she knows what her boss puts these women through behind closed doors. Like the commanders' wives in ""The Handmaid's Tale"", the audience wonders how a woman would allow herself to be complicit in a systemic operation so diabolical.""Compliance"", directed by Craig Zobel, is a 2012 thriller based on a real-life incident, in which a middle-age female restaurant manager, under the spell of a male authority figure; a bank manager impersonating a cop on the phone, conducts an illegal strip-search of her employee, a nubile. Serena, in ""The Handmaid's Tale"", resents June(Offred's real name) because of her baby-making capabilities. The institutionalization of rape that the denizens of Gilead practice can be read as state-sanctioned revenge exacted by the menopausal over the menopausing. Cruelty is the point. Sandra Frum(Ann Dowd). the manager of a franchised fast-food joint, wants to be one of the girls, but gets laughed at by Becky(Dreama Walker), an actual girl, who thinks her boss is out of earshot after the older woman overshares about her love-life. This humiliation, although not explicitly addressed, arguably, plays a part when the voice on the other end of the line urges Sandra to be his surrogate, a dirty cop. Since Becky rejects the restaurant manager as one of the girls, Sandra becomes one of the guys instead, chatting amiably with ""Officer Daniels""(Pat Healy), the fake policeman, soaking in his praise for a job well-done. Faye, similarly, because she is a woman of a certain age working at Fox News, where youth and beauty are hot commodities in such a highly-sexualized workplace atmosphere, the old-timer can't help but feel a little resentful towards the long-legged beauties that march through the organization's doors and inevitably co-opts her boss' anti-feminist ideology. Faye knows that Roger's casting couch is still fully operational. The cable news network needs a mother figure, not a stepmother type who puts women in harm's way; a stepmother is less likely to care about the victimization of somebody like Kayla, and her ilk. Cynical and ironically misogynistic, Ailes' enabler is something akin to a cultist; a true believer in the wrongheaded notion that all high-profile hirings are transactional affairs. ""Bombshell"", however, sends the audience a mixed message, suggestive of Faye being a starmaker instead of a madam. Sure, the filmmaker defends Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly, but Kayla, a nobody, reinforces a stereotype about successful women in the entertainment/news industry when she excitedly tells Jess(Kate McKinnon) about an upcoming screen test for ""Fox Business"", inspiring her cubicle mate to remark on the seemingly untouched woman's ""Anchorwoman Barbie"" outfit. Later on, presumably, after Kayla doesn't land her dream job, she calls Jess and recounts in graphic detail the sleazy encounter with Roger, causing the closeted lesbian to widen her eyes, symbolic of the audience's eyes, because we're all wondering the same thing: ""What if 'Fox Business' hired her?""""The Word"", Episode 13 from Season 2 of ""The Handmaid's Tale"", Emily(Alexis Bledel) stabs Aunt Lydia(Ann Dowd) in the back as part of her escape from Gilead. Lydia, clearly, enjoys the power she holds over the handmaids. Being an unnatural woman holds more currency than being a natural woman. That's not the case for Roger Ailes' administrative assistant or the fast-food restaurant owner, for now.",Bombshell

That's the message behind the message.There is an undeserved righteousness to this story.

174,Dello_,Powerful in its message despite some rhythm issues,7,19 April 2020,"""Bombshell"" is not a masterpiece and I have some problems with it that are mostly about the direction, the editing and the lack of a proper score. The camera movements are good but I personally don't like the when there's a zoom on a speaking character and this movie has a lot of them. This one is only a personal taste but I feel that the editing is a real objective issue because it's too fast, there are a lot of people and names thrown in with fast scenes and is a bit confusing at times. Furthermore I have preferred two or three slower scenes in which it could have been depicted some extra internal struggles of the main characters.
The fact is that even with these problems ""Bombshell"" is able to convey convincingly its message about sexual harassment. Indeed it shows a bunch of different stories and they all have in common that due to the power of the harasser the women didn't have much choice. On the other hand there are the different answers to the situation: some are more rational, others are fearful and there were also the ones that tried to have benefits from it.
The ending of the movie was great and it induces you to reflect about it. The worst part is that the story didn't take place in 1960s' but in 2016 and we all have to do a better job. If you have the chance try to give a look to ""Bombshell"", it won't be a waste of time.",Bombshell

176,JackCerf,Lie Down With Dogs Get Up With Fleas,5,20 January 2020,"Since this is a political movie, I'm going to comment on it from a political perspective. Carlson, Kelly and the fictitious Kayla were all fine with short skirts and glass top desks. They all wanted to work for an enterprise that advocated all day every day that a toad like Roger Ailes or his master Rupert Murdoch is the highest type of humanity, who had earned the right to do as he pleased with his inferiors. Their employer disapproved of the laws prohibiting sexual extortion on principle, and they knew it and went along for as long as they could. They were all good, loyal servants of the patriarchy until it asked for 110% loyalty. What happened to them then resembles what happened to all of those good, true-believing Communists who Stalin shot or sent to the Gulag in 1937-39 because they were loyal to the idea and the system but not quite loyal enough to him personally.Of all the real, as opposed to fictional characters in the movie,the only one I had any sympathy for is Nancy Erika Smith, a hard nosed plaintiff's lawyer who has spent her whole life fighting and beating people like Ailes. Without Smith or an equally skilled employment lawyer, Carlson would have been rolled over by the Fox News litigatin machine. But then, there's nothing glamourous about her, so she got very little room, or credit, in a story about right wing blondes who supposedly saw the light.Ailes deserved what he got, and worse. Like Cardinal Wolsey or Thomas Cromwell, he served a capricious, egotistical absolute monarch to the best of his malignant ability and thought he deserved gratitude. Instead, when he was no longer useful to the king, off with his head. Only metaphroically, though.",Bombshell

It is not so much the interweaving of documentary and feature film techniques as the integration of the rhythm, form, and documentary of news reporting into the feature film. The subject matter is taken from famous events, reflecting the phenomenon of workplace sexual harassment in the TV media field in the Me too era. Various people and other people have appeared in the stream like water to restore the real ecology. To the extent that it is uncomfortable, no female audience who pay attention to the topic of me too Would complain that it is ""boring"" and easy to cut? I just think it's ""exciting"" and ""very exciting."" Queen Theron!

178,garethvk,From The Headlines To The Big Screen,8,19 December 2019,"It was an event that sent shockwaves throughout the News industry as allegations of harassment brought down Roger Ailes and fueled the growing ""Me Too"" movement.In the new film ""Bombshell"" we learn how Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), had so much power and influence that he helped elect several politicians and rose to the head of Fox News. He ran Media Empire to great success and made those around him celebrities.The film follows Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) who opts to fight her ouster from the company claiming that her career was marked by frequent harassment often by Aisles himself.At the same time; Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), is dealing with backlash from Candidate Donald Trump and is being forced to endure what she sees as verbal attacks for the good of their audience and ratings.As this story unfolds, the audience is introduced to Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie), a young journalist eager to make her way up the corporate ladder. She is introduced to Aisles who asks her to ""model"" for him claiming that since they work in a visual medium; he cannot just let anyone on the air and needs to ensure ""loyalty"" amongst his staff.Carlson eventually files a lawsuit but due to the power that Aisles and the Network holds; nobody is willing to come forward to back her and she is faced with taking on the media giant alone. The movie then centers on the key players and their day to day lives which enables them to find the strength to come forward and do what they believe is right.The film is powerful and all of the leads do amazing work. Lithgow is especially good in his role as he is as captivating as his is loathsome in the part.The film is sure to spark some discussion as despite the events portrayed in the film it appears that many of those who acted improperly managed to financially win from their downfall but it at least set a precedent for those looking to come forward knowing they are not alone.My only issue was that knowing how the story came out and that fact that it was very recent undermined any real drama but the performances and engaging and topical subject matter held my attention throughout.4 stars out of 5",Bombshell

A time that was so crazy, to the point of Donals Trump becoming president. No doubt there will be many more movies to come that share stories of what actually went down in this time and allowed things like Trump being in power to happen. I'm glad there wasnt actually a lesbian scene with Margot Robbie, that wouldve just been unnecessary and take away from the story.

He advises them that their dress should be well above the knees. And all this in the background of cut throat competition among the TV corporates to be the best. Tensions are faced by three lady employees Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie. All three have put up stellar award worthy performances.

And they were met.Every once in a while a film comes along in order to take advantage of a real-life event. The films immediately following 9/11 for instance.And like those films, this one fails.And the reason it fails is precisely because it is 'real'; concerns actual people. In this case two former TV personalities from FOX News. Neither of whom (Charlie Theron as Megyn Kelly, Nicole Kidman as Grechyn Carlson) tugs at our heart. They are privileged women. And yes, they were taken advantage of by a sexist man in charge of a sexist company. Even so (1) we never see either of them harassed and (2) they are, despite it, living the good life. Their houses, their vacations, their children; they are people of the Top 1%'.Which leaves us Margot Robbie's character, fictional news producer who is charged with evoking sympathy and anger from the viewer. We want to know enough about her to feel the shame, the 'self-revulsion' she must feel following each instance of harassment. But while there is one scene depictingv thiz situation, and though her character says she is a 'millenial evangelical', there is not enough shown of her to have us believe in her past, or feel what she feels.Charlize Theron is great as Ms. Kelly. Nicole Kidman is 'lost at sea' as Ms,. Carlson; she is a non-character if ever there was one. I enjoyed Margot Robbie but wish there was more of her and her character's back story.

189,Benslie,An important and powerful movie,9,23 December 2019,"First of all, the cast in this movie is incredible. From the main three actresses to the side characters everybody is a stand out in this movie. You mainly follow Megyn Kelly, played by Charlize Theron, Gretchen Carlson, played by Nicole Kidman, and Kayla Pospisil, played by Margot Robbie, and everybody gives it their all that you care for each one of them. For me I feel like the real stand out of this movie is Margot Robbie. She gives it her all in this performance and it deserves recognition at the Oscars because she represents all of the women in that kind of industry. Sure, a majority of the women in this film, the characters not the actual actresses, probably went through what she did but we, the audience, get to experience it with her, you don't see what happens okay just watch the movie to figure out what I mean. Margot Robbie just brings everything she's got to this role and I just wanted to help her out in this movie. One thing that I love about this movie is the story. If you've seen the trailer for this movie or have looked into it you know that it's about a sexual harassment case and this movie does an incredible job of showing the struggles a woman goes throw when this happens to them especially at a place like Fox news. The movie does a great job setting up the stakes early on in the movie so us the audience members know what's at stake for all of these women. I will say this the pacing in this film is kind of weird. At the beginning of the movie where there wasn't any focus on the sexual harassment, the story was kind of slow but once the case starts that's where it picks up.

There are five main characters, Kate McKinnon being less prominent but stunning in her performance nonetheless. John Lithgow, Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron and Margot (I Tonya )Robbie all deliver bang up performances, one no better than the other. But when you see Charlize Theron you'll believe you're looking at Megyn Kelly on the screen. The script is taut and well crafted, never tedious or boring. The production design becomes tiresome when shaky cam, war reporting camera technique is employed . But then that never makes for good film making. The film would be a solid 8 or 9 stars if the film making was as good as the script and the acting. So what do we have here ? A film that lays bare in lurid detail the sexual escapades of Roger Ailes and to a much lesser degree Bill O'Reilly that cost Fox News , say , $100,000,000. The women to one extent or another may have fallen prey to their own ambitions but it is clear who the victims are.

Harassment at work is the premise and in this context, FOX is the platform. Excellent performance by each of the actresses who developed their role perfectly. Besides, the negative appearance of Donald Trump sheds light on a social problem in the mentality of many people regarding these issues.",Bombshell
193,tstudstrup,"This movie is incredibly boring, incredibly staged and just pointless.",1,8 July 2020,"It takes place in 2016 during the presidential campaign. Its very political and its clearly released now, to keep Trump from getting another 4 years in the white house. I hate Trump and he is the worst president ever. However this feminist movie wont make a damn bit of difference. Trump will most likely be re-elected, because the American public are morons and because of electoral college and the whole corrupt political system in America.
But that's another story. Lets get back to the crap that is ""Bombshell""*SPOILERS AHEAD*It takes place on Trumps favorite news station: Fox News. Back then Roger Ailes (an over the top disgusting John Lithgow in a fat-suit) ran Fox News. He offered attractive women on Fox promotions in exchange for sexual favors. In the end he was fired for sexual harassment, based on a lawsuit from a fired woman, who wouldn't have sex with him and won the lawsuit and 20 million dollars.
You have these two annoying leads played by CharlizeTheron and Nicole Kidman (both have had their faces ruined by botox) who wants to take down Roger Ailes. And a very attractive Margot Robbie who is the only one that is actually showsn being harassed by Aisles. And a bunch of other very unattractive women including the ugly Kate McKinnon, known from SNL, playing Hilary Clinton as well as starring in the awful SJW remake of Ghostbusters from 2016.John Lithgow and Margot Robbie are the only ones giving good performances. The rest are a bunch of angry and swearing women who hates Aisles for giving them good jobs and for giving him sexual favors, they themselves agreed to in exchange for those jobs. Nobody forced these women to have sex with Aisles.Therons character who never actually had sex with aisles 10 years ago (she just did the twirl for him) decides to bring him down. After working for the man for 10 years in a highpaid prestigious job. The rest of the men in the movie are pretty much just pushovers, only there, to agree with these angry women.Most ridiculous scene. Therons husband plays tennis and he loses to another guy. The guy walks up to Theron and says ""Trump 2016"". Her husband then threatens to kick his ass iif he ever talks to his wife again. As they leave Theron says to her husband he is getting some action for standing up for her. This is an actual scene. The guy just said he will vote for Trump. He wasnt even threatening Theron.Another ridiculous scene, also with Theron. She reads something in a binder about Trumps opinion about women. She immediately gets sick and runs to the bathroom to throw up. Give me a freakin' break!!Other annoying things: peoples names and titles appear next to them on the screen, Trumps tweets appear on the screen and sometimes these angry women looks directly into the camera in the middle of the scene. This makes the movie feel staged and its hard to tell how much f it is made up, even though its based on a true story.I recommend avoiding this movie unless youre a whipped boyfriend that wants to get some action from your bossy angry girlfriend and then youre forced to suffer through this metoo znooze-fest. If youre a single man just don't watch this. Simply because your balls are still intact.I cant even imagine most women would even enjoy this. Probably only man-hating feminists.And like others have pointed out: if they wanted to do a metoo movie, why didn't they make one about Harvey Weinstein or Jeffrey Epstein? Much much worse predators!!Me and my friend, who struggled to stay awake in the cinema, during bombshell, had not heard much about Roger Aisles and FoxNews. But again this movie is also very political. And maybe they don't have the guts to make a movie about Harvey Weinstein, because that would make Hollywood itself look bad. Which makes them a bunch of hypocrits.",Bombshell
194,TheCasualReviewer,A solid depiction of a disturbing story,6,6 January 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Inspired by the true and disturbing scandal of the man who created Fox News, Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), and the women who spoke out against his horrible acts.REVIEW SUMMARY:
I really like the way this film is shot. The sort of narrative/meta/4th-wall-breaking style of direction is an amusing way to tell a story. I can't speak on how accurate this film is as it even begins saying some of the film is dramatized as most of these type of stories should be in my opinion. Not to create more drama than there actually was, but in most cases it makes it a better feature film and the better a film is the more likely these stories are to be seen by more people. Contrary to what I just said, I've heard more negative about this film than positive, but I thought Bombshell was better than what most people thought. A couple scenes that left me speechless in disgust and you could just feel the tension in the filled auditorium. That's definitely a strong sign and the acting was stellar. Not in my top 10, but solid nonetheless. 6.5/10.-------------BREAKDOWN-------------DIRECTION:
As I mentioned in my review summary, I love the style of direction this is. You can see clear inspiration from ""The Big Short"" and a little bit of ""VICE."" The pace kept the movie going and kept the same speed throughout the film. Quick shots of a variety of close-ups adds a bit of tension and really makes you feel the spotlight of whoever the newsroom is focused on. I have to give it up to Jay Roach on this one.WRITING:
The dialogue was strong throughout and once again I'm not sure how accurate of a depiction the script is, but regardless it was a strong screenplay. The writing does what it was supposed to and told in a stylistic way that made it easy to stay engaged.ACTING:
There's not much to say just because everyone in this is as good as you'd ever see them. I thought Kate McKinnon did a wonderful job in her small supporting role where she's more dramatic than I've ever seen her and for me the biggest standouts were Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman. I thought John Lithgow was fabulous as well and especially in the scenes she shared with John Lithgow were hard to watch, but VERY well acted. Nicole Kidman gave me a very grounded and real performance. If you know me, you know how important that is for me. I know of all three women, Charlize Theron is getting the most buzz and she was great, but I feel Nicole Kidman is unfortunately being overlooked. Either way, great acting all around.",Bombshell

197,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Bombshell Goes Bust,6,7 January 2020,"The Stream: Nothing new that you didn't already know or suspect.The Big Screen: Charlize Theron's uncanny resemblance to Megyn Kelly is a remarkable feat.The Final Bill: A star-studded TV movie on the big screen.-Trip FontaineIn the colloquial sense, people and things can be described as a bombshell. Catastrophic news can be a bombshell; or, an attractive woman may be characterized as a bombshell. Most likely, you have heard the term ""blonde bombshell"" - get it? Whatever. Okay, Jay Roach's Bombshell plays with those connotations in alluding to the revelation of rampant sexual harassment at Fox News as well as the numerous, mostly blonde employees of the network. The titular bombshell was reported in 2016 when Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson exposes then CEO Roger Ailes and the toxic culture at the network, so the history is very recent. I would suspect anyone going to see Bombshell will mostly be curious about the star-studded cast because they would already know the basics of the story. There really isn't much more to it.Nicole Kidman plays a fierce and steadfast, Gretchen Carlson. She's tired of the ""boy's club"" antics of her co-anchors and the disregard she is shown by Roger Ailes, who is played by John Lithgow under layers of makeup. I think Kidman is made up to resemble Carlson, and it's a good job because she looks like herself but not unrecognizable. Carlson is out on a limb when she goes against Ailes by exposing him and Fox News, but she needs allies.The remainder of the film is basically grappling with whether any other women related to Fox News will tell their stories. The primary focus is on Megyn Kelly played by Charlize Theron and a composite character, Kayla Pospisil, played by Margot Robbie. Theron is unrecognizable. She looks so much like Megyn Kelly and sounds like her too that it is mindboggling. Her performance is really good although it doesn't seem like there's much at stake for Kelly. She seems pretty insulated from any potential fallout whether she supports Carlson or not. Robbie is very good as well. Because her character is fictionalized, she doesn't come with the baggage of Megyn Kelly or Gretchen Carlson and gets to be the ambitious, young wide-eyed fool who wants to work at Fox News and naively trusts these people she idolizes. Robbie gets to be tender and devastating in her own right.It is hard to be spoiler free on Bombshell because we lived these events so recently or you can just go to your trusty internet search engine and read the articles for yourself. I ask, does the film justify its existence? The cast does a good job. There are a lot of cameos throughout of the other Fox News personalities - Geraldo, Judge Jeanine, Greta, etc. The make-up is great - just look at Theron in one clip. The film as a whole feels like the other political retellings that have come out as of late, mostly on HBO, Recount, Game Change and last year's theatrical release, Vice, but there's really no deeper point of view about any of these characters or the situation. I do not know that this movie is necessary now - aside from depicting that women working in the conservative news field endured their #MeToo moments as well.The only real reason to see Bombshell is to watch Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie in these performances. They are all great, but the first teaser for Bombshell (the 3 women in the elevator and that suspenseful music) was the most impactful part of the film. If you really want to know what happened, read the articles from only 3 years ago. Save the viewing of the movie to when it premieres on HBO next year or whenever, if you must see it.",Bombshell
198,helenbassett,"Bombshell Film Review - Jay Roach Directs The Popsicle News Girls To Strap On The Spanx Pants, Slip Into The Heels & Keep Your Salty Mouth Shut",10,26 January 2020,"Bombshell directed by Jay Roach depicts and dramatises events that came to a head in 2016, when Donald Trump was on the campaign trail, although to be honest but for the film publicity I had no idea here in the UK who the identikit (ie. replaceable!) women depicted are. First World problems for the beautiful people of American TV. But strap on the Spanx, slip into those vertiginous heels Tv is visual and you need good legs, with trowels of make-up. And to get ahead girls you need to give a little head. And if you want to play with the big boys you have to lay with the big boys. Toxic for the audience to hear this in the MeToo era. But it all seems so long ago. 4 years that's all!Like The Big Short the film employs the fourth-wall to let us eavesdrop on the action. Oscar nominated Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly sets the scene for us. John Lithgow is Roger Ailes, the then CEO of Fox News, although the real power behind the throne is the Murdoch family. But they don't get their hands dirty here, while Roger's hands are full, and his trousers are bursting. With his assistant, Holland Taylor's Faye, pimping for him in their office suite.Nicole Kidman plays an ace as Fox News's Gretchen Carlson. She did her homework as she sweats her way through menopause with no make-up live on air. Nice one Roger. And while Gretchen was happily playing along with the guys everything was fine, nice boobs!, but when she's had enough with the sexist comments, she is effectively demoted down the schedule of Anchor, and her hackles rise. Her firing over assault rifles!, naturally she's against them, is the touch paper that sees her file a sexual harassment claim against Roger.And surrounding himself with his wife played by Connie Britton, lawyer played by Allison Janney, and Gotham's Richard Kind as Rudy Giuliani (I knew him), Gretchen gives Roger just enough rope. And when she presses play, it's all over.While Megyn is the Anchor who takes on Trump during the Republican presidential debate, using the real TV footage, and wins plaudits from Roger, but is then sidelined for the bigger story that is Donald Trump himself, in right-wing Fox News. Of course they provide protection for her against the assault rifle carrying haters. But she still has $15 million reasons not to join Gretchen's action. Although she is undoubtedly the star witness. Interesting to see Mark Duplass as her husband. Giving the newsroom a wide berth after The Morning Show!And Margot Robbie, also Oscar nominated, plays Katya Pospisil - are they kidding here? She's from a good Fox watching Christian family, a Jesus Influencer (whatever that is), a Republican naturally, and the writers must have had a field day riffing on popsicle and creating this wide eyed ingenue. Honestly I'm surprised they could keep a straight face. And as she gets more popsicle, the dresses get shorter and the make-up gets thicker. And the office notices. She's Anchor Barbie, Kate McKinnon's colleague Jess suggests. But Katya's not feeling comfortable about it. For a keen young woman her first meeting with Roger makes the skin crawl.Jess is the only one who comes out well in the office. It's a given that everyone at Fox is a Republican. And as a smart journalist she knows her best chance of survival is to keep quiet when you're a lesbian Democrat supporter. Imagine the horror.And there is complicity in the office, the women who came before and kept quiet, like Gretchen and Megyn themselves, and the men who knew. But that's the way it worked for women to get ahead.  He's upfront about his likes and dislikes. No orange, but he would have looked good in that colour!, and no trousers.I'll believe all the plaudits for the hair and make-up, you cannot imagine Charlize Theron in the prosthetics or Nicole with wrinkles, all created by the Oscar Nominated Kazu Hiro, Anne Morgan and Vivian Baker. Although the costumes by the great Colleen Atwood were also spot on. The Roland Mouret Galaxy dress is perfect. But why do women who already look like that feel they need control pants?For the viewer Bombshell sounds like a heavy subject but Jay Roach balances it with lighter moments. John Lithgow seems a sweet guy so his portly sleaze ball must have been tough, but what a role. And all kudos to the three leading ladies characters; Charlize plays her smart operator at the height of her power but afraid to use it, Nicole didn't have many of the lighter lines being the chief accuser, but she caught every word of Roger's come-ons. While Margot Robbie at the start of her Fox career was the one we see on her knees, metaphorically speaking. And as I said I didn't know most of the characters, but the story was gut wrenching. And no doubt will always go on. Discretion versus ambition. Until the balance of power changes.",Bombshell

201,a-78738,Fantastic film,7,7 June 2020,"As far as I'm concerned, ""breaking news"" the front is very good, first to several characters to break the fourth wall opening to introduce myself, although many are not used to this kind of narrative may make the audience get confused about, but it is a lot of dialogue, tie-in rhythmic clips and scenes scheduling, me completely sucked into the movie, like a deep afraid carelessly miss key lines, in news work need nerves, competition is intense, at any time will be the others don't know when to replace the atmosphere, in this environment will lead to film the subsequent event would not be so strange.
It is interesting to note that ""breaking news"" in the ""public news"" this position has towards the conservative republican camp, and loved by the President of the United States trump TV media, since 2016 after the outbreak of sexual harassment, Roger to deduct the subject itself has a great development space, generally liberal and democratic Hollywood didn't give up the beaten opponent an opportunity, so efficient is the movie made, I think will be the operation of the ideological and political intentions, so we can see in the first film the picture.",Bombshell

We live in a world where body shaming is a real problem, where not one female superhero is represented by a regular female. All people deserve to be treated as equals but do they realize that equal means more women of races other than white, representation of all body types, representation of all age groups. The world also needs to wake up to the fact that breast are not a sex organ any more than is a mans chest. Lastly equality will never happen as long as Donald Trump is president, Trump being president says that most are okay with discrimination of all types, okay with bullying, okay with sexual discrimination!Look how much money google spent at the direction of Sundar Pichai to cover up the discretions of Andy Rubin and what the agency's in Hollywood that were supposed to be their to represent Actors and Actresses did to cover up for years of sexual harassment at the hands of Harvey Weinstein. The things that have come to light over the past few years are probably just the tip of the iceberg of what has been going on and probably is still going on in corporate America.",Bombshell
204,Vivkon,Support Your Whistleblowers,10,20 December 2019,"Encouraging, persuasive, outstanding storytelling. The film encourages people to expose the truth. If you keep silent it will hurt others and it will also hurt the holder of that silence. The underlying factual background for this story makes this drama persuasive in most details: feeling the pressure of peers; the sense of an insecure unstable environment; sadness of victim of harassment. The cast and music score help to deliver a message about resistance against improprieties within the work environment. 📚 🎥The make-up Department is paramount. The likeness of the real people to the movie characters is fantastic. However, the make up of certain actors looks a comedic. An absolutely unexpected transformation happened with Charlise Theron, who adopted Megan Kelly's voice, posture and facial movements. Sharliz Theron is famous actress with the ability create characters that transform her identity. The make up team has taken the technical aspects of the craft and turned at into an artistic achievement. 💄 💇The movie expresses a powerful maxim: ""Whistleblowers save the World"". ""See something - say something"" - this is the final point of this movie. Although it is a additional head ache for the HR department to verify complaints but without testimonies of the victims of harassment, the job environment could be still be a wide field for predators for many years. So, the movie shows how whistle-blowers can break down the wall of silence and cover-ups in the work environment (P.S. make home work and do right things). 🌎",Bombshell
205,Jackblyth8,The Perfect Cast,8,8 February 2021,"Empowering women and supporting feminism, 'Bombshell' explains in detail the exposed truths of Robert Ailes and Bill O'Reilly and their unjust, misogynistic ways of running and being involved in a company. Fox News is a very republican, and Robert himself had a strong friendship with Donald Trump, who in 2015 was running for president. Charlize Theron plays Megyn Kelly, a ruthless news anchor who doesn't hold back in asking Trump the 'big' questions. After questioning Trump over his sexist remarks and misogynistic comments, Kelly experiences backlash, Trump himself and his supporters target her on social media. Rather than backing Kelly's views, Ailes, mastered by John Lithgow, advises her to keep a low profile and allow the protests to quiet down. Nicole Kidman also stars in the 2019 film as Gretchen Carlson, also a news anchor who shares the same ideologies to Megyn; she takes a stand and chooses not to wear make up on her segment 'The Real Story', leaving Roger furious. We see Roger Ailes offer jobs to attractive women, on the basis of them showing off their figure to him alone, almost as if he was examining them in the purest form of objectification. He intends his cameras to focus on the women's legs and that dresses should be tight and well above the knee. Margot Robbie plays young, aspiring news producer Kayla Pospisil, who is oblivious to Roger's management techniques. Kayla learns the hard way about the chief's misconduct and callous nature, as the pair share a meeting in his office. She also forms a friendship with Kate McKinnon's Jess Carr, who is a democratic lesbian, two things she hides whilst working at Fox. Gretchen is fired by Roger for her stand against his policy, giving her a reason to file a lawsuit and sue Ailes and expose him for sexual harassment. Ailes convinced all in the office to support him, encouraging them that if 'he goes they go'. Megyn Kelly returns from her absence to confront Trump once again in the hope for answers, her questions dismissed. Shortly after, Theron's character joined Gretchen's campaign, speaking openly about how Ailes tried to kiss her during a discussion. Megyn then stimulated other women to speak out about Roger's actions. Rob Delaney's cameo as Gil Norman points out to Kelly that there will be no future for he and many others, taking Ailes' side for the sake of his job, but, following her passionate feelings, Megyn encourages 23 women to step forward and admit they were assaulted previously by Ailes. Being CEO and chairman of Fox News, Ailes was under increased pressure to act upon the allegations, at first denying it alongside his wife Beth, the pair decides to file a lawsuit of their own, their attorney (Allison Janney) states she can't run the case because Gretchen cleverly recorded every conversation involving herself and Roger. In a formal meeting with chairman and CEO of 21st Century Fox Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch forces Ailes resignation, the capitalist receiving $40 million with Murdoch succeeding him as chairman and as interim CEO until the naming of a permanent replacement. Gretchen, Megyn and Kayla were 3 of the 23 strong and integral women who helped bring down Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly for their inappropriate behaviour and chauvinistic opinions. During a welcoming for Rupert, Kayla leaves the office, choosing not to work in a place where she was personally affected and violated. Ailes ultimately avoided financial ramifications and didn't contribute to the $20 million payed to Carlson, just one of the three accusers Fox News had to settle with. The film is centred around a true scandal, however, Kayla Pospisil is a dramatised fictional character, used to emphasise the strain caused by Ailes. Megyn Kelly - pictured with Donald Trump - plays the pivotal role in fighting back against Ailes and Fox's overall sexism. Manifesting equality, the watch is at-times difficult and uncomfortable, purposely to represent the realistic situations many women faced, not just at Fox News.",Bombshell

Incredible acting from the three female leads: Charlize Therone, Nicole Kidman, and Margo Robbie... plus supporting cast like Kate McKinnon (of SNL) and all the others. McKinnon is known for comedy, but she's far more than a comedian, and it shows in her acting skills! And John Lithgow as Roger Ailes was incredible (and truly hate-able as Ailes!) The acting on behalf of every actor in this movie was incredible!This really makes you hope that the events that occurred in Fox News (and revealed) dampen ANY possibility for this to continue there or anywhere else.. and a great reminder that we should never tolerate sexism or any discrimination in the work place or anywhere else.On a 1-10 star scale, I'd give this a very respectable 7.5!

Unfortunately, the women who exposed him were horrible in other ways so it was difficult to find any merit in any of these women. Megyn Kelly eventually went on to NBC but was ultimately fired because of her outlandish political views. As an expose film it provided little new information that wasn't already known. The biggest tragedy was the fact that so many were afraid to come forward because of the fear of being fired and not being able to find other employment because of the power of Ailes and Murdoch (even though that was conveniently left out of the film).",Bombshell

The presumed purpose of the film is undermined by the addition of a fictional character who seems to be the only woman at Fox News actually to acquiesce to Roger Ailes' sexual demands. While much care was taken to transform the leads into their real-life counterparts, many supporting roles are poor resemblances of their real-life counterparts.

That is no real choice and is no more of a choice than those who slept with Weinstein. This is an abhorrent, powerful and fantastically acted movie with Theron absolutely fantastic with Kidman, lithgow and Robbie not far behind. I think it's telling this movie starts with trump harassing the female anchor but it's a shame murdoch comes out as some sort of hero which loses a star (and it's lucky it didn't lose more) and I would have liked a more negative slant on Fox as a whole but i will be patient in waiting for that movie.",Bombshell

The three ladies Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) personally file lawsuits against Fox News creator Roger Ailes (John Kithgow). The first thirty minutes cover the backstory narrated by Theron and the rest of the story thought us what not to do at the workplace. The seven part mini series The Loudest Voice is much better than this movie. All this one had was an all star cast from Allison Janney to Kate McKinnon to Connie Britton and Malcolm McDowell. I mean there were so many that it seemed they were fighting for on screen time. Overall it was an okay movie just to see the beautiful ladies. It should have been more political but it was portraying the seemingly uneasy workable environment at the Fox Network. I would say skip this and watch Crowe on The Loudest Voice, it is the same storyline but better plot.",Bombshell

For the reviews I read a lot of people are looking at this in a political side and saying that all the bad reviews are from Trump supporters and stuff like that, but I don't think that's the case, I hate Trump and I condemn sexual harassment or sexism towards women but the movie wasn't good at all, one thing is the information and the story another separate thing is the movie itself, you can have a mediocre story and a great movie and a good story and a mediocre movie and this is the case. For example, a movie about racism or prejudice isn't automatically good just because that's the main theme, the cinematography it's a art that in some cases doesn't match the story, sometimes for the best others for the worst. The cast was great and was another huge capitalizer of this but with a cast like this and this story I just think they could've done it better, more intense, more interesting, more memorable, and they could've gone deeper, this felt short and very superficial.",Bombshell

An inside look at the official state propaganda organ of Trumpistan was as unpleasant as I'd expected and I left the cinema in need of a Silkwood shower. Roger Ailes was the most disgusting blob of human flesh that ever existed, and the world is better off that he's dead. (John Lithgow melted into pounds of prosthetics.)As entertainment, it was satisfactory. It was a weaker film that I was expecting, and I'm just not a big fan of the Adam McKay-style of filmmaking, with the cutesy call-outs and fourth-wall-breaking to explain concepts or fill in history. Not knowing much of the story, nothing came as a big surprise, and it's as fetid an environment as I'd expected. They really gave short shrift to Gretchen Carlson, as I barely learned anything about her, but I did leave the movie with more empathy towards Megyn Kelly, even with all the harm she's caused over the years. (White Jesus?! Please.)Most importantly though, Charlize Theron is still our queen. She absolutely disappeared into the role and became Megyn Kelly. I continue to love Margot Robbie, and it was great to see Allison Janney and Holland Taylor in small roles (both playing awful women aiding and abetting the vile Ailes).",Bombshell

To be a face on a prominient network such as Fox News requires something above the ordinary. However, this is not the case of that network. The film shows how power and authority can shape one's personality, views and even appearance. Roger Ailes, head of the network wants something more than what his female workers bring on board this creates that fierce competition. However, the film did not impress by not showing how fiercely the competition was. How do you manage this competition? Well Roger is smart, loyalty is all he needs and his ability to play that cat and mouse game on his victims was direct, bold and manipulative, due to great script and directing. Surely, his cup was full as Carlson, a fired employee sues him for harassment. As ready stated, the wind of power and authority kept victims including Kelly and the young ambitious Kayla in their shell, with all three actresses performance being fantastic. Cats are let out of the bag and Roger sees the end of his once idolized firm within the industry becoming a syndicate of sexual harassment.

It is a matter of principle. You can be the change that you want the world to be. We will back you all the way. So you take the difficult first step. You bite the bullet, stand through the embarrassment, convincing yourself that you are doing it for the greater good. You persevere, you fight a good fight and find yourself drained of your finances. The friends who promised you to stay through thick and thin now become sparse.You proved your case. Your victimisation is proven. You should be happy, but then you have a bitter after-taste. Your image is tarnished. You will forever be frowned upon as a trouble rouser. You are a liability for peaceful coexistence. Somehow you get a feeling that others (read the purveyor of law and order, it seems) who benefitted most. They screamed for justice even though their methods remained much to be desired.You stand alone, but you soldier on telling yourself that your action may rub and alert others in the same shoe.This film, based on actual events, tells about a time in 2016 when an anchorwoman with Fox TV, Gretchen Carlson, decided to spill the beans on her Head, Roger Ailes. Soon many other female presenters came forward with accusations of sexual harassment against Ailes. Events like these spread like wildfire to other parts of the world. Many up and coming artistes came out with their bad experiences as part of the #Metoo movement.Sometimes, I wonder if this is the proper way to expose overt discriminations. It leads to animosity, negativity, and it creates a toxic paranoid working environment. Sexual harassment, even though allegations may be proven, it is enough to tarnish the image of the alleged perpetrator. Any publicity is good publicity for the accuser.
I know a lawyer who once advised his client to sue his doctor. It was not because he had a strong case against the medical management of the client.

Almost all of the reviews with low ratings were made by Fox News lovers - as is obvious by their remarks.This is a really good movie, one that I didn't know much about since I avoid the anger-inducing newscasts for the most part. One of the biggest complaints seems to be that Margot Robbie's character was a composite and therefore not truthful...but almost everything that happened to her was based on the facts from real testimony.It's isn't just Roger Ailes and Fox News that have toxic environments where women are degraded, it's widespread in business even today - and I think that's one of the reasons this story is so powerful.One of the things that hooked me immediately was the amazing and convincing performance by Charlize Theron.

228,bobzmcishl,Intense and Chilling,10,9 January 2020,"Ignore the one star reviews. They go with the territory when Hollywood makes a political movie. This is one of the best. It will be compared to The Loudest Voice, but it is a movie made from the perspective of the accusers and not the accused as Loudest Voice was. Bombshell doesn't pull any punches whereas Loudest Voice took their foot off the accelerator with Ailes at times. Bombshell doesn't. It shows Ailes in all his evilness from his treatment of women, to his extreme conservative views, and coziness with the Republican party. They way they covered Donald Trump is particularly disturbing. But the intense core of the movie is the three leads, playing Kelly, Carlson, and a composite character, played by Margot Robbie. Kidmann is excellent as Carlson, and Theron is outstanding as Kelly. They are riveting on screen, and they capture the ambition of the three characters as well as their humanity, and pressure to do the ugly in order to land a prime time slot. It paints a very ugly picture of Fox News as well as Ailes. The movie reminds us that not only arewe are living in very chilling times, but speaking truth to power can have enormous consequences. The big screen treatment of this story makes a much bigger impact than for example watching The Loudest Voice on television. Roger Ailes was a brilliant but very flawed man, but what he did to women comes across so devastatingly it left this viewer with a very horrible feeling at the end. Theron becomes Kelly and that gives the movie a dramatic wallop. Because we are seeing three very ambitious women played out on the screen, it was initially hard to feel sympathetic toward them but at the end, we realize the enormity of what they had to endure and the lifelong scars left.",Bombshell

The voice is perfect(although I did notice it being shaky at times) and she comes extremely close to looking the part.I'm curious about the tv show. It looks like they took an approach with this film almost similar to Oscar winner 'Spotlight' a few years ago but they missed the boat by 77 miles.

This true story magnifies the abusive story of sexual harassment & women discrimination which both need to be addressed to the audience as to how corrupt and dirty the workplace can be.Bombshell approaches its ideas with full throttle by flooding gallons of the controversial contents without meeting its ends. The better thing is that those contents which are presented do not seem to pull the punches. The transparency is out in the air at all times, letting viewers with very sensitive info.Powerful performances by the femme fatales but the one who steals the spotlight is Margot Robbie. Her acting is miles better than Theron & Kidman especially the on-the-phone scene near the end.With a triple threat of female leads, Bombshell is an undeniably good feminism film. This is a movie that gets it right to show its support for the prevalent political movement without forcing the agenda too much of a slap to the viewers watching.Bombshell has unique transitions since its beginning. They opt for many powerful filmmaking techniques to entice the audience as much as possible.The tension is placed in the gray area. The elevator scene is the highlight of heightening its raw tension masterfully. However, the movie overall lacks this aspect mainly due to its pacing.Pacing is the main problem Bombshell is facing. The middle part addresses one of its sub-storytelling in a painfully slow build-up. The final 20 mins opposes it by rushing the plot promptly.Another problem it faces is the connection those three leads have. They don't establish a good interconnected relationship resulting in each of the character's story feels disjointed from one another. Only the third act that the connection starts to develop well.Throughout, there is no background song being played except for two or three scenes. This is the problem, the movie has it so good without no song but when they do, they emerge this bizarre atmosphere because it feels forced to just put the song so suddenly.Verdict: Though Bombshell has its problems to light up its incendiary, it manages to drop the bomb very hard to deal with its worthy subject, its terrific cast who magnify the subject and its enticing story which ticks off better than expected.",Bombshell

She put up with the snide and overly complimentary comments by her co-hosts and Ailes himself. As an integral part of the FOX News team, Carlson wanted to be seen as a peer and not a sexual object to be ridiculed. Her desire was to have her own show where she could call the shots. Over the years, she'd had many encounters with Ailes, many of them sexually charged and suggestive, but as a good reporter, she documented their meetings.As she got older, Ailes wanted fresher and younger faces on the morning program, so he gave her a much-desired show of her own. However, it was placed it in the small audience afternoon time slot. However, that did not shy her away from doing some controversial stories, like older women without makeup show. This show, in particular, struck Ailes the wrong way, and we see him railing at Carlson and ended up not renewing her contract.Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) was an up and comer in the news organization. And we slowly begin to learn, she also had sexually charged encounters with Ailes. However, Ailes did support her challenging Donald Trump on the campaign trail and at the debate. She hated becoming the story. The story shows how becoming the story opened her up to changing how she needed to work.Then there is the story about the young woman, a conservative FOX employee, who wanted to be on air. Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) was a charger and aggressively sought out a way to speak to the man in charge, Ailes. The film shows their one on one meetings and Ailes propositioning her about how she could get to the top. The scene when Ailes asks her to stand, twirl, and hike up her skirt so he could see her legs were incredibly humiliating.The movie cuts quickly from scene to scene and assaults you just as the news stories on television do from time to time. Scenes do not languish in this movie but are weaved together to create an account about how one woman Carlson decided to stand up to Ailes by suing him personally in hopes that others would join her.Kidman was terrific as Carlson. Her internal strength to bring on a lawsuit was well presented. Theron was Megyn Kelly. The use of archival footage of Kelly and then segueing into scenes with Theron was seamless. It was a dominant performance. Robbie, as Pospisil, was sublime. I loved how she was able to show wide-eyed wonder, wanting to please, and desire to be noticed by senior management, then turn on a dime and show complete humiliation. Robbie's ability to explain all this in one scene and still give the audience a cohesive character was flawless. Lithgow was perfect as the angry slimeball Ailes. His displays of anger and indignancy were well-founded in his being caught being a predator. Allison Janney as Susan Estrich, Ailes's lawyer, was excellent. Kate McKinnon as Jess Carr, a co-worker of Pospisil on ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" was perfect. She hid that she was a gay liberal working for Fox because it was the only job she could get. Charles Randolph wrote a pointed and robust script. Jay Roach did an excellent job of portraying the slow shifting tide at Fox News.Overall: The event documented in this story helped to give wings to the ""me too"" movement.",Bombshell

It's a powerful story that needs to be shared for how woman can be treated in the workplace and hopefully spreads the message that inappropriate sexual behaviour is never acceptable and should be spoken up about.Nicole, Charlize and Margot were all so damn good in this film.

Sort of like all the 1/10 negative reviews, that have right-wing dilatantes bleeding out of their wherevers themselves; the reviews almost seem as if they could have been mass produced out of some sort of strange machine, for they almost uniformly start off by calling the film a hit piece, followed by a complete absence of any substance to back that up. The rest of these typical reviews are a complete word-salad where it seems a game is being played to see how many buzz-words can be crammed in while still remaining vacuous and uninformative.There certainly are an incredible amount of poor reviews referencing ""The Loudest Voice"" which is strange, 1/10 for a fantastic, relevant and biting drama because it couldn't go into as much detail as a TV mini-series? Odd criticism.But enough about the crazies, bots, and trolls; the three main female leads are all fantastic, with a script that really pops and keeps you guessing even though the broad strokes are a well-known part of the public record, no mean feat, and shows the really bizarre culture at Fox News for what it was, and still is, mastabatory fantasy of a bygone era that never really existed for its viewers, a toxic mess of highly unattractive old white men whose behavior would be viewed as reprehensible even by the men of ""Mad Men"", and walking through an emotional and mental minefield for female staff every single day.Bravo especially to Theron, I forgot that she wasn't Kelly more than once during the film it's that immersive and her character that engrossing, though I can see why fans of Donny Bonespurs are so upset with the film, for the only thing needed to damn him are his own tweets, and own TV appearances, so there is no one for them to rage against, save perhaps the reflection in the mirror.Very emotionally engaging, very effective as well as evidenced by the lunatic fringe of reviews that say nothing about the film itself and instead climb aboard a platform of logically fallacious what-about-isms and false equivalencies, and what better metaphor for Fox News and the toxic culture of abuse it fostered than that?

This is a movie for allies and females in general. Like Hustlers (2019), but in a whole'nother way, I feel like it needs to be watched. Partially because of how interesting it is and mostly because of how important it is. Bombshell does a great job of balancing many topics focusing on a central theme-women's issues in the workplace. Most are smoothly handled over time (like warming up buttered bread) while others are blatantly laid out (like deep frying meat) as if to avoid anyone missing the point of it all. But like any fry cook can tell you, dat meat gon' come out just right.
While the 4th wall breaking presentation of matters effectively (and damn near stylishly) blurred the line of documentary and drama/thriller, I must say it worked well, especially with how long the movie went without.
The reason why I say this is for allies is partially because of the reviews I read on Letterboxd beforehand and mostly because a female I saw the movie with called its entirety ""nothing new.""

Comment:
There's something very depressing and ""somewhat"" infuriating about the thought of this kind of crap being common in the workplace. Instead of getting too controversial, I'mma just say one thing. If you treat people poorly enough long enough, it's only just for it to bite you in some way. The unfortunate part is that bystanders will probably get caught in the crossfire.
Question:
I'm wondering. Would this story be atleast moderately different if the perspectives weren't of European descent? This question comes to mind because of two things:
1) A conversation I had with a sista during a group discussion about This Changes Everything (2018). She explained to me that the documentary was mostly about ""White women.""
2) Queering the Script's (2019) conversations on the lack of non-European-American LGBTQ+ representation in television and web series. This topic was also briefly brought up during the post-Q&A with Stephanie Ouaknine (producer). For some reason, almost no one wanted to be on record saying why it was the case.
Disclosure:
I attended the 30min cast Q&A ""The Conversation - Live Simulcast Q&A with Charlize Theron & John Lithgow"" immediately before seeing the movie, so I appreciated the portrayals and cosmetics far more than I probably would have otherwise.
Also, as previously mentioned, I watched and discussed the movie with a female.",Bombshell
246,OlgaGorelik,Surprisingly gripping even though I knew most of the story,7,9 February 2020,"Bombshell is the definition of a movie ripped from the headlines. In fact, it ripped some of the actual headlines along. Some scenes also look like they've been ripped from sexual harassment training videos. Yet, the movie works. I found it gripping even though I knew pretty much everything that was going to happen, just not the details. I think part of it is pacing and editing. But I give the most credit to the acting. Whether it is Charlize Theron who is not recognizable or Nicole Kidman who is, I saw Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson. Whether the real life person was someone whose appearance I was familiar with, like Rupert Murdoch (Malcolm McDowell), or not really, like Roger Ailes (John Lithgow, talk about unrecognizable!), they came across as human. Too human maybe, you actually feel sorry for Ailes. Perhaps they should have shown a bit more of what it was that got him sacked, beyond the scene where he made Kayla (Margot Robbie) pull her already short skirt so high up, much of her underwear was exposed. The scene was fantastic and his heavy breathing - definitely disgusting, but I still think they may have left a little too much to imagination. Or maybe that was the point - you look at that old man and it's hard to imagine he still does these things, yet it's true. Margot Robbie did a fantastic job playing Kayla, but the character may be a bit too much of a composite - it's inconsistent. Her bedroom scene with her new friend Jess (scene stealing Kate McKinnon), twice-closeted as a lesbian and a Democrat, seemed especially odd. Their banter was great, but why exactly were they in bed when Kayla said she was not gay? Were we supposed to think that she is? For a moment it gave an impression that she was the type who would sleep her way up, with men or women, but she is clearly not meant to be that way. All in all Bombshell may not be a great movie, but for the story it was telling - it's pretty darn good.",Bombshell

There is a lot of walking around & shuffling within the film, there are some more interesting parts where the women have to actually show there legs more & are subject to awkward situations which does set a tone for the film, then how it is all covered up & that no one wants to speak up.Apart from that it just wasn't good, i certainly won't be talking about This film in the years to come, as i say it would of been better as a TV doc.But at least we get to See Margot Robbie :)Age - 25

They made me feel sorry for Fox News employees.,8,10 July 2020,"A talented cast and a great script makes Bombshell an entertaining blend of a girl power trip and 'power to the press' polemics. Even if it is still Fox News.The three main leads (Theron, Kidman, and Robbie) are all very good. I always thought that Elizabeth Banks should had played Megyn Kelly but Charlize Theron was good. Nicole Kidman is immediately sympathetic as the beleaguered and weary Gretchen Carlson. Margot Robbie of course is as charming as ever in a pivotal role as the one fictional character Kayla.John Lithgow is well cast as the powerful, paranoid, and perverse media boss Roger Ailes. He's literally a mountain of flesh but politically savvy if morally repugnant. Lithgow embodies the old school sexism and social Darwinist attitude one would expect from the guy who founded Fox News.The movie flows at a good pace and dispenses key information about journalism better than similar films like The Big Short did about economics.

252,dungeonstudio,The Slippery Slope Of Selling Sex...,8,9 October 2020,"At first, I was biased to this movie. Having grown up in the 70's and 'the me decade', John Travolta and disco, and the 3 Wise Men - Hugh Hefner, Bob Guccione, and Larry Flynt. Women were sexual, women WANTED to be sexual, women know sex can control men - whether we get it, or not. And that there was ALWAYS going to be conflict between the sexes personally, economically, and historically. What turns women on...? Honesty, communication, and respect. What turns women off...? Desperation, dominance, and threats. And as we all should know by now - ""power corrupts"". Hugh, Bob, and Larry respected women, and respected their businesses. Women that wished to contribute were more than welcomed. Women that got uncomfortable, defiant, or disgusted - the exits right over there, and better luck elsewhere. Simple as that. But how to sell sex where sex 'shouldn't' sell? How does one separate 'appearance' over 'attractiveness'? Men are essentially ""Wear a nice suit, shave, and keep a nice hairstyle"". Women are a lot more to handle. Most women are very good at how they want to look, and what works best for them. Wardrobe, make up, hairstyle, jewellery, poise. BUT - some may overdo it, or not do enough. They may like 'floral patterns' on their clothing - but conflicts with the office environment or TV cameras. Some may think a lot of mascara or very little brings out their eyes best - and are wrong. Tight fitting clothing vs. loose fittings. To conceal or reveal imperfections, moles, scars, tattoos. And if a women is up for getting a make over to 'fit in' better, I think there's always going to be 3 reactions from different men. ""You look very professional now"", ""a much more attractive appearance"", and ""Wow! SEXY!"" And somewhere in all this 'political correctness', feminism, anonymous communication, and mental health awareness, women are really loosing themselves in the muck and mire of it all. And I have to give credit to Bombshell now, as it shows those levels. What is acceptable and/or tolerable. What is touchy and emotional. And what is downright crude, disrespectful, and threatening. Megan Kelly is aware she has to have an attractive appearance, to please producers, cameras, audience, and Roger Ailies. She's hip to selling a little sex to help sell the news. But what of the women like Gretchen Wilson that dare to defy that unwritten rule? The really cute office staffer that is uncontrollably cute and attractive? Should they be addressed? Should they be comprised? Should they be taken advantage of by any means necessary? And I have to give it to this movie as it covers all the levels, without really accusing anyone of outright conscious harassment. Yes, a questionable moment where a hopeful promotion turned into termination because she wouldn't accept the mans advances. Which he supposedly apologized for. But even for Roger Ailies, and the accusations - the movie doesn't paint him as the predator most people came to see him as. He knew what works for TV, he respected the women that worked for him, and he was attracted to them in some cases. But he knew his position, his power, and his protection. Did he let it get the best of him? For the amount of testimonies - apparently so. Were the women right to out him, and expose his history? Yes. And is all of this going to make things better for women and toxicity in workplaces from now on. NO! But, it does give all a good framework of the boundaries and lines that can and cannot be crossed. And a little more open honesty during the fact, than after is the best way for both sexes to get along for the future.",Bombshell

To be fair if you really want to know what happened in a slower development of the case just go and watch the far superior Fox/showtime mini series The loudest voice starring Russell Crowe.

254,jditch,The ONLY actual film review here:,8,8 January 2020,"There are four fantastic acting performances in this film, Theron, Robbie, Kidman and Lithgow. Lithgow is so good, that only at the end of the film did I remember, that it was an actor at all. It reminded me of Christian Bale in Vice, so good, so convincing, you forget there is another person under the make up. Meanwhile, Robbie is such an incredibly versatile actress, her body acting is outstanding. Kidman was strong, and Theron is Megyn Kelly. She's so similar I actually forgot what Kelly looked like in real life for the duration of the film.The plot is strong, well formulated and fairly easy to follow. There is a fair bit of law lingo, but it should be reasonably easy to follow. I've seen some reviewers complain they struggled to follow the plot, which in all honesty, is bizarre. Watching this film and not knowing names like Bill O'Reilly and Rupert Murdoch is like going to watch Jurassic Park and complaining you don't recognise the dinosaurs, it's up to you to understand the basics. You can't expect a mature film with a complex story to spoon feed you everything.I don't remember a soundtrack, so I assume it fitted well and was used in all the right places.The CGI editing was really strong. A bunch of times you find the actors pasted in to existing Fox footage and it's very impressive.I really enjoyed the film. It was objectively good, with very strong acting and a shocking story. There is nothing major for anyone that isn't an angry or sad to complain about. It's just a solid film.So try to ignore the silly scores of 1-4, this isn't one of the worst films ever made, by any stretch of the imagination.I knew reasonably little of the ""Fox News Scandal"" before my viewing of Bombshell. So I was really surprised to find such a moving and compelling story focussing on house hold names from the states.",Bombshell

258,WillsFilms,Breaking News: Bombshell's Decent.,7,26 January 2020,"Bombshell is a good movie, with solid acting and a powerful message. Charlise Theron and Margot Robbie deliver absolutely stellar performances. Theron dominates her every scene with an exceptional stage presence fitting of her role as powerful news anchor; Megyn Kelly, while Robbie portrays the ignorance, vulnerability and discomfort towards her superiors fantastically, completely selling the more uncomfortable scenes and making the viewer fully sympathise with her character. John Lithgow is also fantastic as the CEO of Fox News; Roger Ailes, presenting a truly hateable man in a phenomenal performance. The movie is exceptional at presenting the corruption at Fox News and how the public's devotion to the media they enjoy causes them to turn a blind eye to or dissmiss claims of what's truly going on behind the scenes. However, if there was one large problem with the movie, it would have to be the pacing. During the middle of the movie, the pacing really drags and not enough is accomplished to hold the attention of the viewer. Therefore, Bombshell ends up being a movie that feels much longer than it actually is. However, I still do recommend it as it's message of standing up against sexual harassment in large companies is gradually becoming more important. Bombshell is a good movie, deserving of the Oscar nominations received by Theron and Robbie, while tackling an increasly relevant subject.",Bombshell

The makeup and hair styling is also fantastic and Oscar Worthy making the actors look very similar to their real life counterparts. This movie also had a few moments that were powerful to watch at times and showed some of the awful things that happened at fox news when Roger Ailes was CEO.However I found this film to be quite disappointing, as it showed glimpses of being powerful and really reinforcing the message its trying to send us about the me too movement, it doesn't do it enough and overall feels like a very surface level retelling. I would have liked to have seen more about Roger Ailes and why he decided to sexually harass these women, as well as explored all the characters deeper and how they have dealt with the trauma they have experienced, the only character that did this was Margot Robbie's who was made up. But I found the scenes that explored it deeper the most compelling of the film. Also the film decides to slam Donald Trump a little too much at times which is frustrating to see because it doesn't feel too relevant to the events of the film. The implementation of Nicole Kidman's character was also frustrating as we are supposed to sympathise with her but she doesn't really do anything to win us over.Overall I can't help but feel disappointed in Bombshell it kept me at arms length the whole film and showed me a surface level retelling of these events, that makes me wonder what was the point of the movie. The message it is trying to tell us just doesn't quite hit home because it feels like it is afraid of exploring these horrible events further.

To begin, the performances were all great. I thought Nicole Kidman was the best of the three leading ladies-her performance and character was the most like able and relatable. John Lithgow as Roger Ailes was quite superb-dunno why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this. The makeup was phenomenal, it was great to watch. The story and overall message however falls flat. For a film that tries to convey the #metoo and speak up message, it doesn't really add much to it. Sure, Gretchen Carlson and several women spoke up about their abuse which led to the ousting of Ailes and other big names. But it only begs the question, why didn't they do this before?

277,ArmenPandolaITSJUSTAMOVIECOM,IT TAKES A COMPANY LIKE FOX TO MAKE A SERIEL ABUSER,7,25 December 2019,"BOMBSHELLBy Armen PandolaIn Graham Greene's The Third Man, directed by Carol Reed, an American writer of westerns with the improbable name Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) travels to post-WWII Vienna to work with his childhood friend, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). When he arrives, he discovers that Lime is dead and the police think Lime committed heinous crimes. Martins tells a book club audience that he is writing a new book based on his late friend's adventures. A shadowy business associate of the late Lime tells him that he is doing something very dangerous - mixing fact with fiction. He threatens Martins by advising him to stick to fiction, pure fiction.In Bombshell, screenwriter Charles Randolph (The Big Short) dangeruously combines the story of two actual victims of sexual harassment by Fox News creator and CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) with fictional characters who are victims of Ailes' scabrous sexual appetite. Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) is a star at Fox but her unwillingness to continue to succumb to Ailes' advances leaves her without a friend at Fox and she is demoted to an afternoon show and then to the door. Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) is the rising star at Fox who has been similarly 'Ailesed' and makes the mistake of asking Ailes' other creation, Donald Trump, some embarrassing questions about his demeaning of women. The third member of this trio of graces is Kayla Popisil (Margot Robbie), a fictional character who, the author claims, is a composite of many women at Fox who were forced to kneel at the altar of Ailes.For those who have not drunk the Kool Aid, sympathizing with Carlson and Kelly is a tough sell. Sure, no matter what your politics, you have a right to be free of licentious bosses, but - and this is a big BUT - It is difficult to work up a lot of indignation for women who made their careers spouting right-wing/religious prattle while kow-towing to the sexual fantasies of men who ran Fox.Bombshell director Jay Roach (Meet the Fockers, Austin Powers) tries to keep things light and fast. The only scene of actual sexual harassment that is shown is Ailes forcing Popisil to lift her already short skirt up to reveal her panty. But this scene occurs only after Popisil has followed Ailes' pimp/secretary into the elevator with the intention of getting noticed and sent into the liars' den, Ailes' office. Of course, she didn't know what was going to be expected of her, but she was already in an organization that exploited its women and made no secret of the fact that it wished the feminist movement ill. So, in a movie about work-place sexual harassment, the most powerful scene in the movie is a phone call that Popisil has with her cubicle partner, Jess Carr (Kate Mckinnon) in which she reveals that she has succumbed to Ailes' advances and had sex with him. I cannot imagine that this would have been the case if a woman was hired to direct or write the script. Why are we still allowing Hollywood men to tell these stories?Bombshell wants to tell this powerful story of sex and TV, but without too much politics. It follows on the heels of Showtimes' The Loudest Voice with a bravura performance by Russell Crowe as Ailes. While TLV concentrated on Carlson (Naomi Watts), Bombshell focuses on Kelly and fictional Popisil. Kelly's husband (Mark Duplass) is in a few scenes in which he tries to protect his wife from right-wing bullies, but, ultimately, he is disappointed in how his wife deals with the blowback from her confrontation with Trump - but that is the point! Kelly got where she was at Fox because she knew how to play that game.Carlson is fired at the beginning of the movie and her quest to get other harassed Fox female employees to come forward is the driving force of the movie. The performances are pitch-perfect and, as opposed to The Irishman, the accents and make-up match the acting. As they use to say in movie publicity ads, Charlize Theron IS Megyn Kelly!Bombshell ends with Ailes getting the boot from the boss, Rupert Murdoch (Malcolm Mcdowell), Carlson gets her humongous settlement, Kelly does the right thing and the fictional Popisil rides off into the fictional horizon. A blurb tells us that Fox paid $50 million to various women to settle harassment claims, but $65 to Ailes as a parting kiss.I liked Bombshell, but it could have been better. Ailes did not exist in a vacuum - it takes an entire company to make a serial sexual predator. The entire Fox phenomenon and culture was to blame. There was and is nothing that Fox will not do to feed and grow its audience of right-wing, conspiracy-loving, women-hating, war-mongering red-state viewers. Sure, a lot of very good people watch Fox, but these very good people have to ignore a whole lot of nasty behavior by Fox men, just as the female Trumpsters have to ignore almost every tweet, speech and diatribe by the Predator-in-Chief. That is the real story - not what happened, but how and why it happened. We're still waiting for that movie.",Bombshell

In this movie it shows how you can be alone even when you are powerful in your fight against other powerful adversary especially when the system is siding with your adversary.It is interesting to note that after a few years would you classify these women as winners and Roger Ailes as loser. I leave it up to you to decide.Cast in this movie was well chosen and they delivered stellar performance. It is not easy to portray a character that is alive and has been on TV on daily basis.

Even Charlize Theron, one of the best actors on earth seems ridiculous. It's a too over the top impersonation. But the way the movie starts gives you a warning of what is to come. I think they were going for a ""To Die For"" sort of feel and it all went horrible wrong. I was interested enough in the story to be moderately entertained watching it, I just had to block out all the cringe. John Lithgow is terrific though as is Margot Robbie. Theron looks so much like Meghan Kelly it's freaky but I would have preferred more realistic acting. Surely Kelly is human-like sometimes. And Nicole Kidman and that ridiculous makeup job don't even get me started. When actresses who are as talented as Nicole Kidman and Charlize Theron seem bad, that's the fault of the director. I couldn't wait for this movie but what a disappointment.",Bombshell

283,chiefjournalist,It's Charlize's Movie ... and nobody else's,6,13 January 2020,"I hear the movie ""Bombshell"" might contain at least one Oscar Nomination. After watching it with Suzette tonight I think it will only get one.Charlize Theron's Portrayal of Megyn Kelly is absolutely uncanny. I could see her catching a nomination on that basis.The film is written an produced mostly from Megyn's point of view and it focus on the final year of Roger Ailes at Fox News and the Sexual Harassment charges that eventually brought him down.In this regard... the movie was serviceable. Nicole Kidman and John Lithgow characters ""Gretchen Carlson"" & ""Roger Ailes"" were given much less screen time and treated as accessories to Kelly's story.Margot Robbie's ""Kayla Pospisal"" was explained on talk shows as a composite of several actual women who submitted evidence against Ailes supporting Carlson's lawsuit.All in all the movie didn't resonate the truth. The script wasn't compelling enough to allow fines actors to inhabit their characters on screen.Everything about this story is serviceable. There's enough truth in it with decent performances I can see some enjoying this film. (Lots of great cameos by good actors).What may have helped spoil ""Bombshell"" for me was the Showtime Mini-Series ""The Loudest Voice."" This was a brilliant extended look at Ailes career stretching from his departure at MSNBC through his death. Russell Crowe performance was brilliant and the series left you with a deep understanding of Ailes, his impact on American Politics and American life. I left with a deeper understanding and appreciation for women who sued Ailes and sparked the #MeToo movement.BTW; I just Checked Charlize Theron is one of the film's producers.",Bombshell
284,PStyles,A Solid Film About Fox with Excellent Costumes/Makeup,7,9 February 2020,"I thought this was a really interesting film. The topic of Roger Ailes is always a polarizing one, and this film does a pretty good job of capturing that animosity.The costumes and makeup in this movie were absolutely on point. Both Nicole Kidman and Charlize Theron looked the part, and had some striking resemblances to Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly, respectively. In some films, these transformations can be distracting rather than immersing, but I am happy to say that is not an issue with Bombshell. The only person who didn't feel 100% authentic was John Lithgow as Roger Ailes, but that's tough to pull off and they did a convincing job nonetheless.The acting was mostly good throughout. Nicole Kidman was fantastic, and Margot Robbie did a good job as well. Charlie Theron was....about 75% excellent in my rough estimation. There were times when I felt that her acting slipped a bit in wake of the Kelly impersonation, and it distracted me from what was being said (I felt this way a lot in the beginning of the film, and it improved as things progressed). With that being said, she did get nominated for an Oscar so what the hell do I know?My biggest issue with the film was its continuity and directing. The plot seemed to really speed up in certain parts, which was a bit jarring. There were also some strange editing choices which I did not like. Lastly, the film used some fourth wall monologues which felt ""cheap"" in my opinion (also poorly edited), and I generally love that medium of storytelling.Overall this is a good movie with an important message. The acting, makeup, and costume design provide a level of verisimilitude which feels very authentic. I did have some issues with the film, but they weren't distracting enough to really hurt things. I did not feel incredibly impressed after watching Bombshell, but I definitely enjoyed it and will most likely watch it again.",Bombshell

I went into this only being a fan and supporter of Jay Roach, and went in thinking I was going to hate it or goin for a sleep. Boy was I wrong.The story really sucks you in, and makes you question how these sexual accusation's even happen. John Lithgow gives a great performance, a really creepy, scary type Roger Alies really was.Jay Roach and the Casting Director found great actor's for the supportive roles (Hannity, Guliani etc.) Go in with low expectations and you'll love it just as well as I did!A+",Bombshell
286,Oliveraandreasson,An important and well acted film but not fantastic by any means,7,16 January 2020,"This is not the type of movie I would typically enjoy but all things considered, it's an interesting, powerful and, weirdly enough, very fun movie.Seeing as it tackles the important issue of female objectification and sexual harassment it might be hard to imagine it being a funny film, but it really is. There's a very good balance between fun character moments and hilarious jokes that had the whole theatre laughing, and the serious and frankly quote disgusting scenes that had us all sitting silent and reflecting. Speaking of the strong message, the film handles it very well and although the characters achieve minor victories, it never gives us the satisfaction of victory and that really goes to show the magnitude of this dangerous issue.Moving on, the costume and set designs are fantastic and suit the mood and narrative of the film perfectly. I'm not at all surprised that it has been nominated for an academy award in hairstyling and make-up, best actress in a leading role and best supporting actress. As one might expect from this, the acting is great and on Kidman's and Robbie's part sometimes quite remarkable.One thing I'm not particularly fond of is the odd camera work in some scenes and how the zooming and certain camera movements make it look like something straight out of the office. It's obviously intentional and must serve some purpose but I don't get it, and to me it just seems a bit unprofessional.As I stated at the beginning this is not the type of film I usually watch or enjoy but taking that into consideration I quite like it. Some parts of it are fantastic but all around it's a bit slow and uninteresting.",Bombshell
287,drawnsupreme,"Excellent acting, exposes how dumb some women really are and how manipulative some men can be.",6,18 April 2020,"Let's keep things nice and simple. The story revolves around the Roger Ailes sexual harassment scandal at Fox News, sprinkled with some politics. On one hand, it magnifies issues that some women face at the workplace, and the silly choices they make, consent to, or go along with - for whatever reason - but it also exposes how some men use their position of power to take advantage of weak-minded women. This is a EXCELLENT balance to the story.Now, in my opinion, this isn't exactly an exciting story to make a whole entire movie out of. Maybe a documentary would've sufficed, but overall, this was an okay movie. I kinda liked it. I'm not into politics nor do I follow scandals, but I appreciate the filmmakers bringing attention to an issue that plagues our society today.The acting here is phenomenal - Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, and Margot Robbie bring their A-game... and in my opinion, Margot Robbie steals the show with her performance. Charlize Theron is awesomely spot-on with her performance as well. But the story isn't something that will have much replay value for me.

But the movie is not upto the mark..The screenplay is flat not so intriguing..you feel disconnected when you watch it..for a political thriller it must be engaging but here's not..last 30-40 minutes you can say better than the 1st 60-70 minutes part which is definitely boring..Charlize and Nicole's acting is good and Margot is ok in this movie..John Lithgow is better as Roger Ailes and I appreciate the work of make up team they had done a great job..at last this movie is mediocre to below average maybe you can watch one time that's it,Bombshell
289,cmelaniesenf,1 1/2 hours are too short,6,8 August 2020,I'm not an US citizen so I watched the film without having prejudices or knowledge of the actual story and THAT was my mistake! The movie is so complex that I had to push the reverse button a million times which was annoying as I actually like real life stories. This back and forth in time and the storylines of 3 women put into just 1 1/2 hours is ridiculous. Plus me lacking information on the actual event. I shouldn't have watched it.,Bombshell
290,barrynewblood,"Complicated Characters, Great Performances",8,26 December 2019,"As a die hard liberal, I must admit that Bombshell was going to be a tough sell for me besides the triple power team of Theron, Kidman, and Robbie - three stellar actresses known for their fascinating, brave choices in roles and ability to create empathy for even the biggest monsters out there.Sure enough, Theron and Kidman managed to do the impossible - make me root for two women who contributed to the popularity of Fox News. In Theron and Kidman's hands, these are problematic, but complicated and not entire unsympathetic women. Do they say and do bad things? Yes, but did they deserve what happened to them? Absolutely not and no woman does.Robbie's job might be a little easier since she's playing somone who never really existed, so there's not as much baggage to take it with it. Still, the film does put a few strikes against her - she's a huge Fox News fan so we know she probably believes a lot of the propaganda Fox is known for, she's an Evangelical with all the baggage that comes with, and she's potentially bisexual conservative, which always confuse liberals. Why would someone in the LGBT spectrum ever fight for politicians who don't really care about their rights? It's to Robbie's credit that she makes this person a realistically complicated and interesting woman as well.Color me surprised that, some flaws aside, Bombshell is one of the most empathetic and nuanced movies of the past 5 years. Would I like to have heard a little more about Carlson and Kelly's own race baiting and bigoted comments? Yes, it would have helped and made them even more complicated and flawed, but there's only so much one can put in a 2 hour film, so I get it. It's still an incredibly well written, acted film and one that is well worth your time.",Bombshell

I'm no so attached with the real-life political issues being addressed in the film but ""Bombshell"" did a good job in presenting women's strength and movement against sexual harassment.
This film could be more engaging without the documentary-like script and some important scenes seemingly lacking a little touch of drama.

293,cineastFGD,Superb Acting and Story on a very disturbing topic,9,18 September 2020,"It's about time such movies are made, so congratulations on a true masterpiece. The cast is superb, Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman are surpassing themselves in portraying Meghan Kelly and Gretchen Carlson. Although they are some of the most famous actresses in Hollywood, they vanished completely behind their characters, in part also because of the incredible make-up artistry and costumes.I was skeptical at first because this movie looked just like another stupid Hollywood flick, but boy was I wrong. This movie mercilessly exposes the mechanism of white men's power, it dissects all the facets of how the patriarchy still keeps women (and minorities) literately and figuratively on their knees. It masterfully portrays the personal risk and the struggles that woman face when standing up to the oppression and exploitation they face daily by male superiors. It hammers the viewer with the fact that women still are objectified and degraded to mere eye candy. And it just shows that women still are a world away to get a fair chance in life. Sorry to say, but if you don't like this movie, you are part of the problem.As a woman who was severely sexually harassed at several work places, this movie means the world to me. It is about time that women learn that they need to speak up, that they do not need to settle, that there is no reason to degrade yourself in order to get a chance in life that is fully deserved. Movies like these are such an important contribution to this development, they are a necessity to advance the discourse, and in the end change.",Bombshell
294,treborquest,"Mixed feelings, the intentions of the characters were off",6,12 January 2020,"First of all. This movie is about a subject that is very delicate and I think it's very good that a story like this one, so quick after the events is released. It shows the story of women being treated like objects and as a man I think we should learn from this. So bravo to that.However,
Besides the fact that the story was based on true events, but enhanced with fictional scenes, which the story in itself did not need, I was very confused at times.
I think they wanted to portray Roger as a likable person at first. 'Trust nobody, because they can be a wolf in sheeps skin'. But for the first half, this made me feel that Gretchen only came out because she didn't get what she wanted.
And that's where I have a problem with this movie. The second half is all about getting the truth out, getting heard, making a point and fight for justice.
But it felt like they wanted me as a viewer to forget that it started with Gretchen, who kept silent for years, until the moment she was fired, who had taped all the conversations for a year, but kept them to use them until the moment she was fired and who opened an attack on Roger, because he was the one to target best at that time.This is all so calculated, because, lets face it, some of these women, including Gretchen, thought they had to do it to make a career. (it doesn't make it right for men to force them, but for the sake of making a point here)
And then, when Kayla starts to blame Megyn, my first response was: 'this shows what kind of person you are as well. Sure those guys are bad, but you had the time to think about it, you did it after all and smiled when you got what you wanted and then, bam, when you see someone you can blame, you blame them.'Again, the movie itself was entertaining. Some of the acting was really good, although Charlize sometimes loses the Megyn and struggles to find her back. Nicole Kidman also had her weak moments, but she wasn't whispering her lines this time.Again, as a man, I think in this day and age, it's good that women in these situations get their stories told and their voices heard. Equality above all. But, even though the movie probably didn't intended me to feel this way, I had a hard time feeling sympathy for some of the characters and I think that's a missed opportunity.
But I also think the ratings should be about the movie itself and not just about the subject. so therefor 6 stars in total.",Bombshell

We know it may be easy to point that now but I think that' what you have made movies for .. not to just get the story out but also to make money ..For me, this movie has ""just"" covered an event and has not inspired anything significant that leaves audience with a strong message .. hence frankly between a 4-5 rated.I am very happy that I watched The Loudest Voice before this movie because not just because it was a better coverage of the event, characters and life' but also left a more lasting impression on me to think about.Would definitely like to mention, loved Margot Robbie for her acting and Nicole for how she played her character.

299,nrabond007,"Nearly perfect, too bad they forgot the plot",7,8 January 2020,"""Bombshell""
or
""We missed the plot somewhere along the way""Political statements in film can be very powerful, and if they are done right in film, they can carry a lot of weight. ""Bombshell"" features an excellent cast, great acting, a true story, and a plot that gets lost in sensationalism, kinda like the media.From Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly to Margot Robbie as Kayla Popisil, and Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson as well as John Lithgow as Roger Ailes, the performances do not miss a beat. Ailes (Lithgow) is creepy with his demeanor and charisma, and that's more of what this film should have focused on. The weakness of the film was in the greed of both the Kelly (Theron) and Carlson (Kidman) characters. The acting, again, was top notch, as they played the greedy victim to a tee. Theron and Kidman should have been written more like Popisil (Robbie), the character we actually felt sorry for, and a lot more scenes that included flashbacks of the goings-on in Ailes' office should have been utilized. Roger Ailes was a disgusting human being who was both exposed for and paid for everything he did before passing on, but the film should have focused more on his acts of quid pro quo and perversion to get the point across. If we could be more sympathetic towards the Kidman and Theron roles, this film would have certainly been somewhere in my top 10, and perhaps Best Picture.7/10",Bombshell

In my theory, Mr. Ailes was not more dishonour than the other bosses. Most probably he received a discrediting trap from politicians. I am sure that who had set up this trap also who organized and promoted two faced, fake presenters. They clearly can be seen did that for much reputation money. Film reflected them as victim but Who silly can beleive that. They lived with these relations for many years, we watched their happiness and swanky behaves.

There are some very powerful and uncomfortable scenes in this film which alone warrants the film at least 7/10. The reason it doesn't rate higher for me is because there are far too many characters introduced throughout the film which makes the narrative disjointed. It has that modern approach where characters talk really fast at each other expecting the viewer to just pick things up, when in actual fact it takes time for my brain to process the context of what they are talking about, by which stage they have breezed on to another character / situation.
The questions at the end were quite pertinent and I certainly don't see anyone being 'let off the hook' in terms of their real life actions. As someone who has a HR background and who has had to put an entire organisation through mandatory harassment training (legally request by a court!)

The cast is star-strudded and actually in my opinion John Lithgow really did an amazing job portraying Ailes. It may be not accurately portrayed how Ailes in real life but it really sends the message based on his performance on screen. Out of the 3 ladies, Margot Robbie had a wonderful performance even as a supporting cast with Nicole and Charlize was a little bit limited but had done a good job in the end.

Under the patriarchal social class power, almost every woman obtains the right to survive by exchanging her gender rights and interests.",Bombshell
319,cgcastanedo-75966,"""The Tip of the Iceberg""",7,8 April 2020,"Revealing film that documents the complaint of sexual abuse, made by Gretchen Carlson TV host, against Fox News CEO Roger Ailes in 2016 and which is gradually adding more women victims of the deplorable behavior of the powerful executive.
With this story ""bomb"" of real life, plus the spectacular cast that integrates Bombshell, the director had the main ingredients to make it a great work, however the film never exceeds the anecdotal level of its history.
We know nothing about Ailes, his friends, accomplices, interests, or his relationship with his wife; she continues to support him, but has she never known or sensed something in so long?
The film is slowly blurred with unnecessary information and insinuations, such as the Republican convention, Trump, Giuliani, the power, the lawyers, the media shock, Kayla's intimacies, etc.
Suddenly, confusion, gossip, speculation reigns, the plot, the rhythm, the tension, and the interest are lost, until the end that we all already assumed comes.
In the absence of further analysis of the key characters in the film, their behaviors seem unpredictable and whimsical.
Megyn's puzzling monologue when she decides to report is the climax of the film.
Incomprehensible that the 3 protagonists do not have a rapprochement when they fight for a common cause, is it ego or is there more?
Insulting, that the epilogue reports what it cost Fox News, to liquidate its executives and what it paid in economic compensation to its victims, it seems that the moral damage committed to women is not the important thing, the significant thing is: the millionaire figures that loses the company.
It is the type of film that, although it seems to be very brave in its complaint, also seems to shield a lot of background information. We only see ""The Tip of the Iceberg""

322,heyitskeane,"""Ready to go to war?"" Not exactly.",6,2 February 2020,"Bombshell by Jay Roach and Charles Randolph, starring Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie is...alright, it's okay.Arguably the best aspect of the film are the performances. Theron absolutely shines in the movie with her portrayal of Megyn Kelly which carries the whole movie. It's very worth mentioning that Margot Robbie is also great as Kayla.Nicole Kidman's performance however, felt rather held back. And that's probably the biggest (and most talked about) issue of this movie. It's very held back and instead substitutes for dramatisation and suspense. It's not a completely terrible decision, there are some scenes which benefited from the drama and suspense. However, it just didn't feel completely appropriate for a film that's supposed to be 'revealing'.Another flaw I had with the movie was the lack of any real connection with any of the characters. The main characters (Megyn, Gretchen and Kayla) had little time to properly build a connection between them and the audience. There are moments where you sympathise with the characters and their experiences, but the film doesn't actually build on any of it. And not to mention that other than them, the rest of the characters just feel like complete extras in the background of a film. That's probably how I feel about this movie. Just being an observer, witnessing this 'big' revelation happening but just waiting to get to the point.Bombshell has got a few things going for it.

The women they salivated on were intensely attractive in real life and as played by Nicole Kidman, Charleze Theron and Margot Robbie. Some gave into Jabba the Hutt Ailes. Some resisted. Eventually they all found the courage to expose the sexual harassment machine at FOX News. It becomes even more twisted, when you realize how Republicans and Evangelicals constantly virtue signal about how wonderful they are and how disgusting liberal Democrats and the mainstream media is. But, as Megyn Kelly is reminded, FOX News IS the Establishment media today.If you're a Republican, conservative evangelical or if you voted for Trump, you will reject the entire premise of the film just like you accept the flat earth or Jesus walking with dinosaurs like Fred Flintstone.

Living as we do in Australia, we were not privy to the antecedents of this picture therefore, we can but judge the screen activity in isolation to the other media productions regarding these events. Furthermore, Diane remembers the circumstances which the film encapsulates, but my poor memory has nothing of these screen events.The screen awards already given to the leading actors speak beyond anything that I could type in these comments. The trio of female actors about which the film is fashioned is superb in all respects. Their impact on the framework of the Network, it's operating philosophy, the male personnel who formulate the news behind that philosophy and, mainly the one male who controls it all is nothing less than a Bombshell.There can be little doubt that people watching this movie, Bombshell will immediately see the terrible relationship between the events scripted in this movie and the events being played out in a New York courtroom involving a no less powerful man who seems unlikely ever to survive the allegations against his reputation.",Bombshell

CT's usually a fine actress, but in this instance her performance was more analogous to Alec Baldwin's SNL Trump impersonation than a serious portrayal of a real human being. Politically, I'm center-right, but I was willing to give the movie a chance (on VOD, at least) because I was an am a big fan of Megyn Kelly and was interested in the story. That said, this isn't a serious movie, a la ""Spotlight"" or ""All The President's Men."" This is cotton candy for people to watch on the weekend when ""Maddow"" is off the air. No nutritional value. If you hate FOX, just follow ""media matters"" on social media or watch Brian Steltzer on CNN and save the rental fee.",Bombshell
345,ewanfortune,Quality,9,19 January 2020,"This was a risky film to make. It's taking a sensitive topic and basing the story around true events that happened within the last 5 years, including stuff around Donald Trump. As well as this, the movie isn't strictly drama with a 'Vice' type vibe around it. However, at least in my opinion, they pulled it off. It balances the almost comic feel it has with serious moments and intentionally uncomfortable ones. It's a scathing look inside mega corporations and how sex is sold.There's very strong performances all round, from Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly and Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson to John Lithgow as Roger Ailes and Margot Robbie as the made up Kayla Pospisil (although the scenarios she's placed in are no doubt based on fact). Perhaps the single most uncomfortable scene in the film involves Kayla as Roger insists she lifts her dress to show him her legs, urging her to go higher and higher as television is a ""visual medium."" It's the type of scene that would be uncomfortable in and of itself but Robbie portrays Kayla's clear distress masterfully and the feeling is heightened once again when you consider that this sort of stuff has happened in real life to real people. The film also spotlights casual sexism and objectification as the women working for Fox are told to wear short dresses and aren't allowed to wear pants. Most of the 'compliments' they receive are about how sexy they are rather than their skills as a journalist.As well as a commentary on the sleaziness of higher ups in corporations, it also celebrates the courage shown by people like Carlson who speak up even when they know it could cost them everything. Theron displays her characters inner conflict brilliantly, working up to the stage where she's ready to speak out too. There's tension in the air and the camera-work adds to this with rapid cuts and dramatic zooms throughout.Bombshell is a great movie standing alone but a movie that also feels relevant in this #MeToo era. It reinforces that the most powerful figures aren't invincible and, though not easily, can be brought down too.",Bombshell
346,kathiklein,A fable - about a truth,3,19 March 2020,"Why not write a great script about sexual harassment in the workplace and not mislead people into thinking that you are documenting the truth about one specific horrific situation?
I followed the actual story as it was happening. Yes two of the 3 stars portray real women. Yes Roger was exposed and dethroned and made millions for leaving.But it annoyed me that it was painted in the light of ""all conservatives are creeps and think and do terrible things""... I think many young women will watch this thinking it was how it actually happened. I watch both Fox news and CNN and they are like two
different worlds. However Politically the left and the right have both had sexual scandals. It's in business wherever you look.You find out in opening credits that although based on a real story we made up most of it - after you've paid your money. It was such an agenda driven smear.However Robbie was great , as well as Megyns two assistants who showed some semblance of mixed emotions .. Yes the harassment must stop and all must speak up. But I find The Morning Show on Apple's tv much more interesting, provocative. Especially in showing the compliance of so many people, along with the ignorance of many men who think they're having consensual sex and ignore the intimidation they impose and the conflict Much more complex storytelling there. This was kind of a cheap shot at targets the writers did not like. And I'm not speaking of Roger because he should have gone to jail instead of to the bank with a fat check.

353,zenmilos,"from ""iQ-filmovi"" at blogspot",7,17 January 2020,"As I have been already commented on the 2020 Oscar-nominated films, it's time to look back at Jay Roach's interesting filmmaking about the true events of 2016 TV Fox, just before Trump was elected for president, when Fox News chief Roger Ailes was fired on a base of sexual harassment charges.It should be noted first of all the excellent acting, but with this kind of casting (Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie), we did not expect anything less. It was also nice to see Malcolm McDowell at the end of the movie as well, after a long time acting in something that is not a third-grade accomplishment.The movie is fast, measured, not boring at any time. Skillfully composed with broadcasts to support the story. Some of the official critics' notes, that it ""shows only one side"", ""does not touch deeply on the subject"", ""is not as clever as it claims to be"", and that it was ""filmed in Hollywood, for Hollywood"", simply they don't stand. Each movie essentially is one vision and one version of the events. The others, who would like to see different side, can watch some other movies, or wait for them to be shot.The events were reportedly credibly described, rather than dealing with the deeper analysis, and lamenting of what was shown, the viewers were left to develop their own thinking. As far as ""smart"" is concerned, there is nothing ""smart"" about sexually assaulting employees, whether physical or mental, things could simply have been happened as they were presented. And for filming in Hollywood, it literally is (although it is the location of TV Fox where the events took place in New York), but far from being for local purposes only, the movie is very interesting and for non-US audiences because it is full of information that the rest of us would not otherwise know.To summarize, the film properly documents the events described, without false pretensions, and without flattering the establishment. Highly recommended for viewing.And finally, another small note: women's legs are still seen in Fox programs.",Bombshell

Women are far from being free from that kind of behaviour towards them. It still happens every day.Some of the women in the movie are unrecognisable because of plastic surgery. Hence they are caught in the same net. Getting pestered for being beautiful when they were young but keep wanting that attention when they get old. That way they reduce themselves to the one thing they despise men for. Their Looks. That's why I gave this brilliant movie only 5 stars.
Men have to learn that women are more than their looks and women it seems as well. That's the one fault of the movie. Or maybe not? I am sorry for hurting some women with this review but I felt it had to be said. We are much more than our looks.",Bombshell

The performances by the 3 main actors are top notch, especially Theron who gives a Monster performance, disappearing completely into character.
I think the pacing was good as could be for a movie based on what was essentially a months long legal battle. The human element needed for fill was well done and the supporting cast hit it out of the park.
For me the only weakness was that the devastating impact of submission to quid pro quo sexual harassment was left completely to Margot Robbie, and it was only really a single scene. The film makers probably didn't want to go overboard, but they could have done, I think.

But The Loudest Voice is the better in depth look at how Fox News beat out CNN and MSNBC by just sticking with we are right and you are wrong for the analyzing and posturing of what the news is really saying. When I first saw Bombshell it all seemed meaningless except when John Lithgow says "" they're calling me 'Juba the Hut."" After the first watch, I watched again and got it. I liked the acting and the difference between the three main woman, especially Megyn Kelly's actress. She did a great job playing her part. I don't know if the fictional character from SNL, who played the lesbian was needed. But maybe there was a real person at Fox that said she was there to keep a close tab on her enemies or maybe they wanted someone from SNL because of its stale anti Trump jabs for the last 5 years. In The Loudest Voice there is a good showing of how Rupert Murdoch was trying to get Ailes under his thump because Murdoch was more in line with not taking risk and just showing the sensational side of the news and not the political. I've never had or watched cable news. But I did watch Chris Wallace on Sundays and he became much worse and more long winded after Trump started debating for president. I'm not liberal but I've always voted Democrat, sometimes just to block the Republican.

It was well directed, the acting was fabulous and the makeup out of this world! Charlize Theron was outstanding. I'm not a Nicole Kidman fan but she was great in this role.
Other reviews are comparing it to the tv show The Loudest Voice. So I started watching it. They are completely different and the two cannot be compared. The tv series has more of a political angle. The movie is a little politically themed but primarily focuses on the sexual harrassment of women at Fox News.
If you thought it didn't happen in this day and age, you are very mistaken! I am shocked and outraged! Ladies make your husbands and sons watch this movie so they get a little understanding of the issues women still face in this world... Even all these years after burning of the bras!",Bombshell

Far from the political aspect of the movie, this film managed in one way or another to tell these events excellently, and we all know that many women around the world not only in the United States or in TV companies have suffered or suffer from harassment at work or even in the streets, and not all women can take their rights away. It is truly sad, if a woman has ambition and seeks to achieve her goals, then she must sell her body to some foolish men, who take advantage of their positions and power, for the sake of their lusts.
Positives
The director Jay Roach did a good job of choosing this directing method, although it was not quite successful, the editing was also excellent, and splitting the scenes between the great cast, in an excellent way, starting with the actress Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly, which was the best in my view, And also the wonderful Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson, and Margot Robbie as Kayla Pospisil that will be of great importance in the coming years, also John Lithgow as Roger Ailes, all of them did a very amazing job, the music was good for the purpose, the choice of colors, costumes, and makeup was very successful.

396,LiamFriedman,Consistently disengaging,5,27 January 2020,"BOMBSHELL 5 out of 10
Consistently disengaging.Charles Randolph, co-writer of best adapted screenplay Oscar winner The Big Short (with Adam McKay, based on the book by Micheal Lewis), wrote Bombshell. He should not be allowed to write alone.The material he had to work with in bombshell had every opportunity to be engaging, however it was horribly executed with maybe 1 good scene of tension and drama.
There is a cautionary foremessage about the presence of dramatisation in the movie. There is no way the movie is less boring than the real events that occurred.No character was given any depth, with the only distinguishing feature being the A-list actor in the part. Randolph could not choose a focus for the story, not any of the characters or even the main issue was followed to any significant degree; instead, the movie diverts to unnecessary tangents about what our characters are up to in their personal lives in what I can only assume was an attempt to humanise the cardboard cutouts. I couldn't care for any of the characters.By an acting standpoint, I managed to spot 3 good actors, Charlize Theron, Margot Robbie and John Lithgow. Lithgow's performance was genuinely engaging as was most of Theron's.
The few Australian accents in the movie from the Murdoch family were laughable as they parkoured between British, American and have-heard-of-Australia levels of accuracy.Maybe in an earlier draft of the script Kate McKinnon served a purpose, Bill O'Reilly was more than a name or Margot Robbie wasn't reduced to an extended cameo, but these are only some of the useless elements that made this movie feel an hour longer than it was.Thematically, the story is hollow, with the only thing the movie says is 'sexual harassment bad', delivering a message beyond safe, that it barely registers as a message. Randolph was unable to even fully commit to any political view on such a significant event, with certain scenes trying to be apolitical and political, displaying anti-trump notions whilst emphasising the reliability and integrity of Fox News, with only a slight left lean, leaving the story forgettable. (The Trump sections were played as cute references?) However, seeing how it reflects my political ideology, it must be good 10/10.But wait. Isn't it hypocritical for such a big Hollywood movie to condemn sexual harassment whilst also practicing a far more toxic culture than a Fox News office? No because the movie is anti-sexual-harassment, so I think they learnt their lesson.There were very few scenes of significant CGI use, but boy were those 2 scenes very distracting. An actor on a roof looked like they were floating, with surrounding buildings and rooftop antennae looking less real than their wigs, and an actor was not well composited into archive footage.Consider me thoroughly disappointed. Should this win any of the 3 Oscars it was nominated for? Probably not.",Bombshell

398,denisefig,I was able to be much better,7,29 January 2020,"The film has a great make-up job and a powerful story that could make the film great, but the direction by the vision of a man and the editing a little too agile leaves the film with little weight, emotion and even a little confused.
The performances are great as you would expect, you feel the weight that the actions had on them, but at the same time there is an extra touch of drama, something that makes you feel a real emotion, you just feel that situation is disgusting and very wrong, nothing more. Perhaps with the direction of a woman the film could have gained more weight.
I also feel that the film ends up taking a little too long to reach the point that ""matters"" and when it arrives it runs too far with the situations, some things could have been dried and better used. There is also a lack of a good soundtrack to accompany the film.

All the leading stars deliver a super powerful performance and two hours are intense and gratifying because of great editing. What I liked most about the movie is that it has a voice and takes a stand - a scene where Meghan is listing all good qualities of Roger and then she looks at her daughter who is sleeping in the backseat of the car; her face face says it all. Most of the movies these days stand on neutral ground and end diplomatically, but not this one. I also love how how the movie finishes with Gretchen having multiple thoughts - what will happen to her career, was the fight worth it, will she always carry the stigma of a victim etc. These are some legit thoughts an individual has when they are subjected to workplace harassment and decide to fight back. Also, an amazing take on how an entitled person who truly believes that they made people, careers and organization feel betrayed when confronted for what they think is a minor mistake. Showcasing both the sides without much melodrama while siding with the correct stance is immensely satisfying. It is a reflection of water tight script and a brilliant vision of the director. I would call this equivalent to a Steven Spielberg direction. Totally recommend watching.",Bombshell

Okay, so they were harassed, bad yes, but then again Meghan seemed fine with race baiting even in her career after fox, so one can be excused to not feel as sorry for her opportunist persona as compared to another. The movie took the whole,""these women did fox cause they had to"" Incorrect, that's life, it's not like everyone else has it easy, you live with your decisions. Also, the environment was clearly ""dramatized"" to the point of resembling Hollywood like atmospheres, so funny cause pretty sure Harvey Weinstein was a thing so it's just a cluster of people with planks in their eyes pointing at others.

Nicole Kidman is mostly relegated to a supporting role, and Margot Robbie is always great to look at, but may actually invoke empathy from her audience in this turn.

Also because not only the leading roles are good, but actually all the smaller parts are believable. Only thing is that I am not American so I don't know the real persons behind the characters, have no idea if the actors portray them well, and don't know the actual story. The film is not perfect, has some stereotypes, some cheesy scènes near the end and a clear message instead of letting the audience think and feel for themselves. But even so, for me they also somewhat show the 'other side' of the story and it makes me feel empathy with the role of Litgow (not sure I am typing this right) by times, which I think is powerfull because it gets the discussion going. Plus; I think the movie has some funny moments as well. Which is nice in a film about such a serious subject. So not a 10 or a 9. Also definitely not a 1,2 or 3 (come on you guys!!!

She didn't add much to the story aside from the ""LGBT person at very conservative news network"" and falters in a scene where's she is supposed to be a emotional rock for Kayla.

I was terrified for these women, enraged at their situation and appalled at the culture that was allowed to form and thrive. How anyone could call this a ""left wing"" movie is beyond me, unless sexual harassment and abuse can be considered ""right wing "" values. It has nothing to do with it being about Fox News. We could have climbed into many corporate climates. It just so happens that Fox News prides itself with being ""fair and equal"" and the fall from grace was so very far and so very loud. An empowering and extremely important film. I have to note that the showing I went to had a small audience of 10 people,only two were men. Both men walked out before the film ended. The women stayed and applauded the film. Perhaps too much truth? Maybe they were expecting a film where 3 blond hotties got into cat fights? Oh, well. They should have stayed.

426,Timburrr,It's okay,7,16 January 2020,"After watching ""The Loudest Voice"", I was rather interested to see how a big-screen adaptation might work - for the most part, ""Bombshell"" centres around the last 7 months of Roger's tenure whilst TLV gives you the entire story and shows just what a disgusting, unrepentant egomaniac he was - from bullying Brian Lewis out of Fox News (and the broadcast industry entirely)to using his power in order to strong-arm his way into small town media outlets. He was Archie Bunker incarnate.In terms of acting, ""Bombshell"" brings the goods - Margot's character is a brilliant allegory for all the women at Fox who were simply too terrified to come forward (who could blame them?), Nicole and Charlize deliver as Gretchen and Megyn while John proves no slouch in playing Ailes.Story-wise, it was like watching on fast forward - difficult to follow and understand since it moves so rapidly. If you've already seen ""The Loudest Voice"" then most of
this story will be pointless and redundant.",Bombshell
427,eccentrickris,A great place to start a conversation and further research,8,28 January 2020,"Bombshell tells the story about the sexual harassment case filed by Gretchen Carlson against the then Fox News CEO Roger Ailes.The film is a dramatization of true events and like all biopics does take some liberties of it's own to create additional drama for cinematic purposes. This film could have gone much further with the actual truth without the need for making up story points, however that most likely would have left the audience feeling more disgusted and angry than where this film already went!I really enjoyed the film and to me the message it was looking to send did land (maybe not as hard as some would have liked). I do remember some of these events happening at the time but living in Australia didn't get to follow the whole story and certainly don't know much about the actual women being represented in this film. I will be doing some more research in the days to come.My take aways from this film would be:1. The performances -
Charlize Theron's performance of Megyn Kelly was phenomenal (Oscar worthy) and Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie also amazing in their supporting roles. All three women, while not often in scenes concurrently held this film together really well.2. Powerful scenes that really drive home the message -
There are a handful of potent scenes in this film but that one I'd like to single out is the scene with Kayla (Margot Robbie) doing the 'twirl' for Ailes and slowly lifting her dress hem up to show more leg. It was uncomfortable and gross, made more so with John Lithgow's performance of the subtle groans which makes it even more not okay. One can only imagine how women in that situation must have felt.3. Give it more credit -
I feel with some films like this that we have a tenancy to think they are not as great as they are because we didn't like the way things turned out. In this film corporate America doesn't loose - it's still going on but is being called out upon more often, especially following this case. But you can't judge the film worse off because of what happened in reality.There are some things that could have made this a better film but I really enjoyed it and would recommend if you liked films like Vice. Give it a go.",Bombshell

But the pedigree involved ensures it's above average.Structurally, this film is a mess. Rudolph's screenplay is scattered, but if you liked The Big Short, it's got similar quirks and dialogue. Still, I don't understand the point of the first act conflict against Trump. Could've just gone straight to the sexual assault. The direction is fine, but this isn't a director's movie. Thankfully, THE ENTIRE CAST kills. Production design, makeup, and editing are all top notch IMO.So, Oscar pedigree + worthy subject + uneven script = above average film. Solid 7/10.

John Lithgow was excellent and played the repellant and paranoid Roger Ailes to a tee.

436,imdb-17220,A character study about the abuse of power,8,16 August 2021,"First of all, I'm an old white guy who spent my life in low-level office computer jobs. In my experience, women and men were treated equally. A programmer is a programmer. So my comments are just about the movie.I really enjoyed Bombshell. To me, it's a character study about people handling situations where others have influence over them, either though a job or whatever. Other than working at FOX, the three ladies don't really have a significant relationship with each other, but they all have the same issue. I thought the journey of the three ladies was well done and was presented as more than just a ""he's a bad guy"". Each lady had their own background story, goals, and approach to life, and shared the oppressive situation of working with Mr. Ailes.I did find the movie a bit difficult to follow in the beginning, but it all worked out.Lastly, my wife and I rented the DVD from Netflix so we were able to watch the many Special Features, which I would highly recommend.Summary - while it's difficult for me to relate to having someone demand sexual favors for job opportunities, the concept of others having (and exercising) power over me is something I can relate to. How far can an individual be pushed before they reach their ""I can't take it anymore"" point? What are the consequences of pushing back? Have you ever experienced the ""I know it's wrong, but it's easier to just go along with it, rather than create a bunch of trouble""? That's the message I got from watching this movie.",Bombshell

I haven't seen a lot of movies where the story in the movie, I actually was alive for, which is pretty great. Movies can't be as specific as the actual event, so on that front they did quite well. A lot of people are saying it's not as accurate as it could be, and It could be more accurate, but then it would be really, really long.Something I really enjoyed about this film was Kate McKinnon's Performance. Even though she want one of the main characters, I haven't yet seen McKinnon do more serious acting, so I thought it was nice to see a new side to her.

463,abhilash-1,Compelling story but bends the knee to the prejudices of our time,7,29 January 2020,"Compelling story but bends the knee to the prejudices of our time. A good movie should inform us about reality while keeping us entertained. While this movie has done a good job in that respect, it caters too much to deeply held prejudices of our day. Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly are the only ones who supposedly broke the law, but the movie might lead one to believe that this climate of harassment is unique to Fox News. It does not explicitly say that of course, but that is how the movie bends to the prejudice of the liberal audience.And then of course there is the whole attempt to tie President Trump to this through a guild by association technique. And the general mockery of Fox's popular anchors like Neil Cavuto and Sean Hannity, the comical portrayal of Rudi Gulliani, 'the women are to be believed no matter what' undertone, the idea that men will put up a defense only because they are guilty. All that are hinted at and given voice.Just a simple story might prove to be too boring, I suppose. The facts have to be used to anchor and promote a certain political agenda. Gives the impression that Fox News is an outlier, perhaps CNN, ABC or NBC might be safer for women. Except that is not true - Amy Robach on the hot mic; George Stephanopoulos covering up for the Clintons and Matt Lauer's behavior tells us that there is more systemic issue here. Smearing Fox is a good opportunity to make money while not addressing the issue. But still, it is a step in the right direction. So go ahead and see it.

It's predominantly focuses on Megyn Kelly who basically even at the end of the film feels like a stranger to the audience. The initial complaint by Gretchen Carlson who again I literally had to google after the film because it ended and I had no information other than she worked at Fox, was harassed and got fired. Then there's a third character played by Margot Robbie who is basically somebody trying to move up at Fox who also get sexually harassed. It's just interesting to me that a film about how women are reduced to nothing but people to harass in this work environment basically didn't warrant further character extrapolation in the film.

485,earthgirl-54214,WATCH IF YOU LIKE POLITICS,8,19 December 2019,"This film is quite good, but I think you HAVE to like politics and know Fox News to enjoy it. The best part of this movie are the performances. The way the story is structured seems to lack some coherence, but it almost feels like chaos, which it makes it really feel like a newsroom. The story is based on real events, but the dialogue is made up, so keep that in mind. What I appreciated about the film is how it didn't seem to insult Republicans, rather the toxic culture of the news network. The audience is intended to sympathize with the women. The critique is mainly of Fox News, not conservatism. The tension built around Interactions with Roger Ailes is nauseating. Again, watch it if you know fox and like politics. Otherwise, you're probably not going to enjoy it.",Bombshell
486,susanmurray-34058,Bombshell,4,15 February 2020,Dont bother!Better spend your time with Loudest voice.Russell Crowes mini series.Sets story up with much more content.The whole story is told in detail.The movie version absolute waste of your time to watch!,Bombshell
487,cindyloupas,Fantastic,10,31 December 2019,The movie was well done and the world needed to see and hear how powerful men have been getting away with sexual-harassment forever. It's time that it stops.,Bombshell
488,rockingkanthi,Not perfect but a Must Watch..!!!,10,7 May 2020,The movie really tried to portray each women's questions and worries before coming out and did it without over dramatising it and boring u but kept it short and to the point. It is a Bomb 💣I don't understand why it has a such a low rating though.,Bombshell
489,kmcdonald-93055,Amazing acting,9,23 December 2019,I just saw this with my daughter and my mother in law.... the acting was BRILLIANT. I remember when all this was happening and in the news. These ladies all did a great job telling the story and the men did a great acting job as well.,Bombshell
490,emmalabarre,ignore all negative reviews - bombshell was amazing!!,10,3 January 2020,"This movie was amazing. my mom and I almost didn't go see it because it hasn't been doing too well in theaters, but I convinced her and I could not have been more impressed by the movie. I honestly do not understand why it has not been doing well (my only guess is that it has to do with the politics of the movie). bombshell has a star studded cast, a great plot, moving performances (I cried), and overall is extremely well done. one thing that I appreciated was that whenever a new character was introduced their name and position would appear. I did not know all of the details about ailes and fox before watching this movie, so this was very helpful. I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. ignore all negative reviews - this was amazing!!!!!",Bombshell
491,nickfarf-99674,spot on and timely,9,13 January 2020,"I just retired as a video technician and have worked at every Network for 42 years. This movie is spot on with the surroundings at a network. The acting was terrific is this film. The makeup made you forget that it is not the real person. With the exception of Margot's character which was created, one has to wonder at what point do employees say enough is enough. Working in the background and observing the interactions of Anchors and their underlings, one takes the message of this film with a grain of salt. Spanning many decades from the 70s to now, one has seen it all. First the reality, then the movie. Alcohol, drugs, sex was the norm. It also wasn't exclusive to only Fox or just men on women. The women on men, women on women and mem on men all were guilty. The backstabbing was all day ,all night, 7 days a week, 365. Now the movie, I I said before ,the acting was great across the board. Now in the movie ,we must understand it's the point of view from certain person position. Right or wrong, the support from fellow employees depended on how it would affect their position. The movie did play it fair as many workers were willing to look the other way or accept sexual harassment to improve their career. One must remember, that immorality is no problem for many workers, as they use it for their benefit as others fall by the wayside. The overall message if one is to believe the story is that employers can't use their power to sexually take advantage of employees and rightfully so. Was their a political swipe in this movie? One would say yes, but hey life is tough. As a conservative, I enjoyed this movie and snickered many times, as I said to myself "" Oh that is so true "". The movie is fast and always gets to the point. Go see it.",Bombshell
492,jaquirungay,Almost walked out,3,20 January 2020,"The first half of the film is VERY bland and dull. I assumed that because the actors were top standard that the film would match, but it unfortunately didn't. It picked up a little in the middle and got a bit better, but there wasn't a climax as such, and no major build up. Also didn't manage to connect with the main actresses.. Wish I'd saved my money on this one.",Bombshell
493,jasonhall-87460,Solid performances,8,22 January 2020,"Well written with characters as complex as they are flawed and a central theme that connects well with both liberal and conservative viewers.For me the true standouts include Margot and Lithgow, Margot in her ability to portray emotion (even with a fictional character a strong contender for best supporting actress). And the incomparable Lithgow in his portrayal of someone who is equally as vile as they are disgusting.Worth the wait.",Bombshell

497,antoniovillasboas,Surprising,10,26 April 2020,"I expected a overly feminist and partial movie attacking men and making them look like pigs. Instead, it's a brilliant movie that correctly shows how there still are unacceptable behaviors from a group of men that fail to recognize women as equals and Treat them with respect. Exploiting other human beings should have consequences, men or women.",Bombshell

499,bill-1640,"Rated 10 for acting, rated 8 for composition.",10,1 January 2020,"Great movie. Love the story, but it is hard to tell the total story in 1 1/2 hours. Acting was phenomenal. I will watch ""The Loudest Voice"" for more detailed content. It is a fascinating story, told very well and well worth seeing.",Bombshell
500,mugs-7,Poor attempt in comparison to The Loudest Voice,4,12 January 2020,"The TV series The Loudest Voice did a much better, and much more hard hitting attempt at really encompassing the depth of this. The movie was really disappointing!",Bombshell
501,saihanis,Truly the bomb,6,6 February 2021,"In a good way though. All the leading ladies are outstanding actresses. Hard to believe it was Charlize Theron at first, she looked so different but still gorgeous yet scary. Total girl power. Nicole nailed her character well. I would like to see more of Margot Robbie, but her short screentime still made a big impact. Great movie.* just read the trivia. Charlize had makeup to closely resembled her to the real life character.",Bombshell
502,mczgnzn,I've seen more African-Americans in an all white neighborhood.,5,18 May 2021,Great story based on true events. Well portrayed and a good movie to watch while munching on popcorn.However. I counted at least 5 black people in the whole movie. Usually I don't notice these kinds of things but 3/4 into the movie and I realized the movie was about women but I had only seen me African American woman. Crazy but true.A good movie nonetheless.,Bombshell
503,sbobad,Good movie and interesting source material,9,30 November 2020,"The acting was amazing and it does really well with the pacing of the characters and writing!

504,hoffkaitlynn,Powerful movie for women,10,22 August 2021,This movie opens the eyes to women and men everywhere to see how women are treated in the workforce. This 100% is not just in the news world but many other career paths. Dealerships it is a complete match how the men treat women.,Bombshell
505,shrinkwrap-2,"Just watched this 'coz it was the only thing here to see, and.....",7,4 February 2020,"I was amazed at the makeup. Truly, I kept looking for Charleze Theron...She was right there the whole time. This could have gone either way. I felt it fell more on the good side. I was pleasantly surprised, tho' there WERE a lot of great actors in the cast. Same movie, diff. cast and it would have gone hell. Well, that's my tiny take on the movie. Sorry for the short review. It's late and my eyes have raster burn......another night at the movies...Everyone stay safe out there.",Bombshell

508,rdemasse,Very Low Viewer Ratings Deceiving,9,24 December 2019,"The overall user rating is dramatically lower than more objective professional critics' ratings due to laughingly-low ratings written by the type of person who actually believes the tripe put forth by the sickeningly corporate-driven alt-right media and lobbyist-bought actor-pols like Trump, McConnell and Graham. Superb acting by Theron, Robbie and Lithgow, excellent portrayal of the inner struggle of victims and enablers leave the viewer with a sense of win/lose. The win is that one strong person can empower other victims to speak out, but the sad loss is that creeps like Ailes and O'Reilly get awarded with $40 million settlements and liars like Hannity and Carlson still pollute airwaves and the minds of easily-influenced non-analytical sheeplike viewers.",Bombshell
509,doegsmith,A sow's ear from a silk purse,1,24 January 2020,Just because you throw some top level actors into a film (documentary?) about something so toxic and topical does not mean you end up with a great movie. Far from it.,Bombshell

511,funner_than_tofu,A woman should have written this story,3,24 November 2020,"Too bad as the talent was exceptional- what a lineup! however, the script and storytelling was awful. A woman should have taken the lead to write this story. The Loudest Voice was way more compelling and thought provoking.",Bombshell
512,davedleblanc,Important. Oscar-Worthy Docudrama,10,28 December 2019,"From start to finish, this film accomplished what it set out to do. Victims of sexual harassment and abuse by people in position of power are put in impossible positions having to decide if their desire to speak out is worth forsaking their career- which is the thesis of the film. Bombshell captures perfectly the inflection point we have reached where truth is being brought to power, and gives a firsthand account of well-known figures who have been in those positions of having to choose between being an ally to women and their own careers.The movie revolves around Fox News, yes. There was no dialogue, thematic element, or any other factor that gives this film a political slant. What we get however, is an exploration of power dynamics in office politics and power. This is not a crucifixion of conservatism or an anointing of liberalism, but a biting and uncomfortable dive into sexual harassment that shows the wrongness and complexity its victims face. Absolutely brilliant.",Bombshell
513,busrakesci,Great topic which can't be told enough,8,13 October 2020,"I watched this movie after watching the series the Morning Show. Sure that a TV Show can easily tell a story in 10 Episodes but in a great Movie it should can be told also great. Some Parts in the Movie were confusing, characters are not described deeply, it is difficult to feel into the emotions of the women. All in all it has a great message and story. The movie is definetely recommended.",Bombshell
514,desleygmartin,The not-so-silent dilemna .,10,26 January 2020,"This movie could be a celebration of Gretchen Carlsen's victory, a soundly placed right hook from the #metoo movement. However, its power lies in its deployment of the inner conflict of the three main characters, Roger Ailes' chosen ones. His sexual puppetry makes him the master over the women in the Fox Newroom. Carlsen outplays him at his own game and these women take one for their team.",Bombshell
515,rahtrip,An engaging political film,9,21 December 2019,Don't usually leave reviews but had to for this one because of all the fake BS reviews by conservatives. It's an important film highlighting the toxic culture and environment at one of the biggest news outlets.,Bombshell
516,dipesh-patel-london,First time for me... But subject matter is relevant.,9,25 September 2020,"Corporate life should never be this way. Shame on people who should know better. Charlize Theron again a chameleon and others well played. Hope this and Russell Crowes rendition, will start to snowball and out stamp the the horrific situations that women find themselves in a predominantly male world. Well done ladies. I hope whistleblowing will continue what I know is the tip of iceberg at the moment.",Bombshell
517,jcook-85496,Powerful movie about a toxic environment that should never happen,10,20 December 2019,The only thing that's disappointing is that this story even needed to be told. It's disgusting that this kind of thing happens in America. I applaud the people who stood up and spoke out to stop what was going on. It's only a tiny dent in the changes that need to be made in workplace culture. So many people still don't see the problem. Great movie.,Bombshell
518,beanhead-65442,Fantastic Acting,9,29 December 2019,Theron & Kidman deliver! I thought the story was told well from multiple points of view and really showed how workplace harassment happens.,Bombshell
519,kmqods,Great movie about a saddening reality,9,5 January 2020,"While this is a saddening reality, I like this movie as it brings out the problems that women all too often face in the workplace into light. I was surprised to see the movie has got an average rating on imdb which can be because some people see it as a political rivalry. While this movie does focus on Fox news, I do not consider it political. This is not about revisiting/scandalizing Fox. This is about women finding their voice for the first time, no matter how powerful the person they are facing is. In fact, I find the movie very impartial and respectful to either sides of the politics. Bombshell is a stamp for a start of a new era helping women and men feel safer in their workplace.",Bombshell
520,kyra-32379,The movie was great,9,19 December 2019,"For those writing bad reviews because they are Trump supporters, you knew what movie was going to be about. This movie was fantastic. Charlize Theron definitely deserves an Oscar for her portrayal of Megyn.",Bombshell
521,brainyflanders,See it!,8,15 March 2020,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I was spoilt for choice at the cinema so I read the viewers reviews here on IMDB before deciding to see BOMBSHELL, they ranged from absolutely terrible to brilliant. This intrigued me and I decided to go with my hunch that with such a talented cast the film really can't miss. It didn't. I don't agree you need to know all about American politics or FOX news to enjoy it (as I am Australian and didn't know any of the lead characters except of course the Murdoch's- which leads me to a negative point why was Rupert player by an Englishman ? Terrible Australian accent).
BOMBSHELL is a strong enjoyable film that is inspiring and topical and exceedingly well acted. What's not to like?",Bombshell
