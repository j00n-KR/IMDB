0,TheLittleSongbird,"""I think you are a sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War""",9,18 August 2010,"One of my favourite quotes from this film you know. As for GoldenEye, I consider it the best of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films. Pierce Brosnan makes for a great and likable title character, and Judi Dench is rock-solid as always as M. Izabella Scorupco is a splendid Natalya and I loved feisty Xenia, marvellously played by Famke Janssen, who kills her victims by crushing them between her thighs, while Janus is wonderfully mysterious as a villain. Technically, GoldenEye can't be faulted either. The cinematography is beautiful, while the locations are superb and the stunts perfectly done especially the car chase through the streets of St Petersburg. The music and theme song are very memorable too, the pacing is brisk and the script and plot are well intact. GoldenEye mayn't be the best Bond film ever, but it is for me one of the more enjoyable ones. 9/10 Bethany Cox",GoldenEye
1,bkoganbing,A Belated Debut,7,30 August 2009,"GoldenEye marked the debut finally of Pierce Brosnan as 007. Brosnan who wanted the part, but couldn't do it back in the Eighties because he was committed to Remington Steele finally got to play the part that his fans said he was born for. After GoldenEye it was more than just Pierce Brosnan fans saying it.The title refers to a Russian satellite with nuclear capabilities that any number of folks would like to get their hands on. The ones who do are the Russian Mafia, in league with a traitorous Russian general played by Gottfried John.Some others that James Bond has to face here are Russian pilot Famke Janssen a girl dedicated to her mission who resists Bondification and a traitor within the ranks of the British MI5 itself. Not the least of Bond's problems are a new ""M"" in the person of Judy Dench who also resists Bondification.Another milestone and a tribute to new relations with Russia is the filming of large portions of the story in St. Petersburg and I'm not talking about the Florida retirement city. It's hardly a first, the film Gorky Park with William Hurt and Lee Marvin was shot in Moscow during the Eighties while a thawing Soviet Union was still in control.Izabella Scorupco plays a Russian computer programmer who embraces Bondification gladly as she aids 007 in his efforts. She is the only survivor of a massacre at a Russian tracking station instituted by the Russian Mafia and the traitorous general.My favorite in the film however is another Russian traitor, Alan Cummming playing a nerd Russian computer programmer who defects to the bad guys. He steals every scene he's in.Brosnan acquits himself well after the most popular of Bonds, Sean Connery and Roger Moore have passed from the scene. He would do three more films and unlike Connery was able to do other roles and well and still be accepted for them as well.Still Brosnan's 007 does have the style needed to carry off the part and carry it off he does.",GoldenEye
2,Leofwine_draca,Overrated,5,27 February 2011,"I remember that a big fuss was made about this film when it first came out in 1995. It was supposed to usher in a whole new era of Bond adventures and Pierce Brosnan was much lauded as the best Bond of all time. But the years have not been kind to this film. After the admittedly impressive stunt-scene opening on the gigantic dam, it lapses into crudity and chaos, with an embarrassingly bad car chase thrown in for no reason, a cringeworthy script and a distinct lack of scene-setting for both our hero and his motivations. I admit it, I've been spoiled by Daniel Craig's outing CASINO ROYALE, which is at least three times as good as this effort.The good news is that the film improves somewhere after the outset, although it still feels disjointed and the plot doesn't make a great deal of sense. I appreciated the Russian villains, but the double-crossing plot is a bit lacklustre and Bond just seems to be in the right place at the right time all the while. I suppose you could say that believability is lacking. In the end, all the things that were wrong with Hollywood in the 1990s – lame humour, an emphasis on computer effects and spectacle over intricacy and tension, bloated running times and seen-it-all-before fatigue – are present here.Still, there are a few halfway decent action sequences to enjoy along the way. The big tank chase that occurs halfway through is the film's highlight, a masterpiece of technical skill, even if the tone varies wildly with unwelcome comedy popping up all the while. The movie also boasts a great villain in Sean Bean, sadly beginning his typecasting as a Hollywood bad guy that continues to this day. He's certainly better than the smarmy Brosnan, whose Bond is and will always be my least favourite of the various actors who've played the iconic spy over the years.I didn't really like Famke Janssen's wildly over-the-top femme fatale here. She's featured in an explicit sex scene that has no place in a Bond film and her mannerisms are completely over the top, cartoonish even. Still, there are some welcome faces in minor roles here, from larger-than-life Robbie Coltrane as a sinister contact and Tceky Karyo as a politician to Michael Kitchen as a nervous spy chief and Joe Don Baker as an ally. Desmond Llewelyn gets some genuine laughs in his appearance as Q and Judi Dench is excellent here as the ball-busting M. The less said about Alan Cumming, embarrassingly bad in one of those geeky hacker type roles, the better.",GoldenEye
3,SnoopyStyle,Good start to the Brosnan era,7,2 January 2014,"Russian Janus group has hijack a Eurocopter and use it to steal the access chip to a Soviet era satellite named Goldeneye. It emits an EMP that would destroy all electronics at the target. James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) must team up with a surviving programmer from the attack on the Goldeneye base to battle a Russian general, a former 00 (Sean Bean), and crazed assassin Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen).This is the standard Bond fare of convoluted story, improbable escapes, and crazy action. It is what a Brosnan Bond will represent. In this one, he even gets to drive a tank in St. Petersburg. Alan Cumming is probably the most memorable character as the sexist Russian programmer. This is the first Bond movie of the Brosnan era. And it's a pretty good start.",GoldenEye
4,Horst_In_Translation,An alright introduction for Brosnan's 007,6,21 May 2020,"""GoldenEye"" is a British/American co-production from 1995 that is mostly in the English language. So this film that runs for over two hours has its 25th anniversary this year. Quite a jubilee! I see this was released on my 11th birthday back then. Man, that's been a while. As you can see on the poster, this is a 007 movie that stars Pierce Brosnan and actually as you can see from the title of my review, this is his very first outing. And looking at the rating here on imdb, it was maybe also his most successful because critics as well as audiences really gave it a positive reception. Brosnan was already in his early 40s when he appeared in here, so not really a very young Bond. I must say I kinda like the actor, but at the same time I feel he is maybe my least favorite Bond. There is nothing that really distinguishes him from the rest. He has a bit of everything and that won't win me over. A touch of Connery's grit. A touch of Moore's humor. A touch of Craig's pain. That is pretty ironic because I have a feeling that if you show a group of 1,000 females one pictures of each Bond actor to have them decide who their favorite is, I feel that maybe most will say Brosnan. At least in terms of looks. Oh well, it is not that important though. He is definitely not a weak selection for 007 either. I am looking forward to (re)watching his other 007 films in the coming weeks. And there were other new aspects in here. For example, Judi Dench took over as M. Quite a thing with recent talk that there could be a female Bond (not just a female Dr. Who) at some point in the near future that they went for Bond's boss here to be not a male any longer. It was over five years since Dalton's second and final Bond movie, so maybe it was time. As for Dench, the mid-90s were really the time during which she had her big breakthrough in Hollyood, even if she was already 60 years old. She racked up Oscar nominations from that moment on. And you can see that the aforementioned ""female liberation"" in 007 movies moved forward here, not only with Bond receiving instructions from Dench's character, but also Moneypenny (the actress' name is Bond) is a lot more emancipated in her one mentionable scene with Brosnan's character. I am not sure I like it though. But it's good nonetheless that the character is in. It is pretty telling that she sort of stood up to him and also let him step out of the elevator first. There are a handful interesting female performances in here. My absolute favorite comes from Famke Janssen, around the age of 30 then, who plays one of the most interesting henchmen in Bond history. Or should I say ""henchwomen""? Maybe. If so, then she is maybe even my number one favorite. Close call between her and Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb. These two could not be any more different, even if they have the same political background and regional origin. As for Janssen, her character is as lethal as hot. Her technique how she kills people, like the guy on the boat, and also later on attempts to murder Bond the same way is pretty unique, just like the idea that she draws strength from other people being in physical pain, almost in a sexual way. It is not explicitly said she does, but it seems that way. Pretty sexy for sure. As long as you are not her victim, that is.The Bond girl, i.e. the one female character who is almost always the most crucial in other Bond movies, did not have a sufficient impact here in my opinion. It is fitting she has to share the screen with Janssen/Onatopp on the poster because hardly anybody remembers Izabella Scorupco these days although there are still many people who love this movie. Scorupco had not one moment as good as Janssen's ""Not yet."" scene for examle. (You will know immediately which one I mean when seeing it.) I am not a fan of hers or her Simonova character either. Her looks are fine, but also physically she is nowhere near my favorite Bond girls. However, her story also did very little for me. The problem is not that it took really, really long for her to actually truly meet Bond, way over half the movie, but it definitely did not help in their attempts to convince me that they have a great connection immediately and that they fall in love. Or maybe it is just sexual attraction. Then it is alright. The first meeting was in the car I think when Bond was unconscious, but has to make sure immediately that they get out of the vehicle alive. This situation results in a bit of a running gag with how she keeps saying that every vehicle Bond enters eventually explodes. That was alright. Certainly one of the better moments including her. But almost everything else was just clumsy, most of all how she is unconscious and then all of a sudden jumps Onatopp in the jungle out of nowhere. Also for example another running gag is about how she playfully complains that Bond does not ask if she is fine every time something explodes. And those were quite a few times. Maybe to make her seem a bit on the tough side too? Not sure, but my biggest complaint is linked closely to that. Sometimes she is really whiny and helpless and sometimes she almost acts on the same level as Bond when it comes to getting stuff done, non-physical stuff obviously. Let's keep in mind: She is a scientist. She is not an agent, not a spy, not even an investigator and yet she manages stuff that felt really way above her talent like how she does not get caught immediately at the main villain's headquarter. How she gives the nerd the pen etc. Okay, enough about her. You see I'm not a fan. However, I pretty much enjoyed her science buddy, who eventually turns out as another bad guy, which surprised me a bit. But it was a fairly hilarious portrayal by Alan Cumming (yep, the young Eli Gold from ""The Good Wife""). Extremely interesting and he brought some solid comedy here and there, also with how after another megalomaniac statement he gets killed in a really bizarre fashion. With how the bad guys were killed, they did a decent job. This also refers to Onatopp (when Bond hears her name, it is one of Brosnan's Bond's rare comedic moments, Bond sure has it with plays on words), but most of all to Sean Bean's character. It is quite a revelation when we find out he is alive and I think when Bond realizes by hearing his voice, Brosnan's face expression of disbelief was maybe the film's best acting moment. Sadly, the fact that Bean is credited second here is a bit of a spoiler for sure. Also look how his first and last name are almost the same. Just one letter difference. Sorry, very random. Anyway, he was a good villain I thought and like I said, his ""For England, James?"" and Bond's response were a highlight of the movie. Also with the first scenes a decade in the past, there was somethhing really unusual: Often Bond has help from a large group of people (he frees for example), often he is completely on his own, maybe with a Bond girl helping him, but that he is on a mission with just one other agent is a true rarity. Also a rarity is that we find out what happened to Bond's parents. Equally unlucky as Batman there. Also on board here is German actor Gottfried John (from my city, rip), who does not have a lot to work with, but continues alright in the tradition of German actors being cast as antagonists in Bond films. Still, strangely enough, to me he looked younger in the film's now than in the introduction ten years ago. Probably just me.I have not yet talked about the men in charge behind the camera. Director is Martin Campbell and the funny thing about him is that he made this film and then returned for Craig's first Bond film a decade later. It will be interesting to see if he also directs the first film for Craig's successor, but this is gonna take quite a while still. Would be a nice idea actually. The characters are of course based on Ian Fleming's work again and one of the script writers is Bruce Feirstein, who has worked on many Bond films (all starring Brosnan), but really nothing else. Not much more to say there. I think as for the plot, it was nice they took the franchise to the age of digital technology, mostly with the hacker guy. Still as for the key plot and idea and purpose of GoldenEye, it was all a bit messy honestly. All you really need to know is that the bad guy wants to basically turn London into dust. Bean's character, that is. His 00 background was a smart inclusion too, especially with what he had to say about Moneypenny, M and also Q. The latter is in it too again and his plastered leg as well as the air bag phone booth are much more interesting this time than the stuff he gives to Bond. And always funny how he is not amused about Bond destroying his stuff. Even without Q's gadgets the amount of hopeless situations that Bond somehow gets out of is ridiculously high again, but let's have him get away with it. 006 should know better though and simply have pulled the trigger when he had the chance to. Finally, Tina Turner's Bond song is one I like as well, actually the chorus not so much, but the rest in fact. A rarity for me, usually I prefer the chorus. And that one was written by the U2 guys. I had no idea. Interesting. Not nominated for an Oscar this time though, but two BAFTA nominations for special effects and sound make for decent compensation, even if I must say I did not like the special effects that much here. Especially in the lengthy sequence when Bond is driving around in that tank, it was uninteresting to me and I wanted more story development. They can live with my criticism there I am sure. The relatively long break after the previous film definitely had audiences curious and this film was also a big commercial success, probably not only here in Germany where it was honored with the prestigious Golden Screen. I can see why. The viewers definitely did not have too much to complain afterwards. I give this movie a thumbs-up with virtually no hesitation. Unless you despise Bond, go see it if you haven't already.",GoldenEye
5,classicsoncall,"""Ready to save the world again?""",7,14 January 2019,"I don't know if there's a poll concerning the most insane stunts that ever appeared in a Bond film, but the one that opens this picture has to rank right up there. Who in their right mind would ever think it's a good idea to plunge off a cliff in an arcing free fall to catch up to a pilot-less airplane, in order to escape the bad guys? No trepidation at all, Pierce Brosnan makes an impressive debut as James Bond and that opening sequence is one that's hard to forget.I have to say, actor Sean Bean in the role of Alec Trevelyan/Agent 006 had me contemplating whether he might have made a good Bond actor as well. He looked the part and matched Brosnan pretty well in appearance and stature. Of course he went to the other sider in this story, so that greatly reduced his chances. I got a kick out of Famke Janssen's character, Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp. (How is it all these Russian characters have three names?) It would be another five years before she would appear in a super-hero flick, but it looked like she might have been auditioning for a role in the ""X-Men"" here. It was a very physical performance, even if her method of dealing death was somewhat exaggerated.The GoldenEye of the title turns out to be the name of a Russian space based weapons program, which eventually leads Bond to the Soviet city of St. Petersburg, where he manages to commandeer a Russian tank and run rough shod through the city. You have to wonder why Western/Soviet relations aren't left worse off after one of these excursions, but it's all in the name of stopping the bad guys before taking the world hostage.With this viewing, I've now completed watching all the James Bond films. I tried to see them in order of release but sometimes availability worked against me. If you take a look at their favorability ranking here on IMDb, the top two in order are ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"", with ""GoldenEye coming in a respectable sixth place as I write this. So it was an auspicious debut for Pierce Brosnan, who's remining Bond appearances didn't fare as well, with all three of his remaining pictures showing up at the bottom of the list. (#20 ""Tomorrow Never Dies""; #21 ""The World Is Not Enough"", #25 ""Die Another Day""). But on the flip side, and I know it's a matter of personal preference, I think Brosnan made for the most appealing Bond overall.",GoldenEye
6,gavin6942,An Enjoyable Bond,7,27 June 2017,"James Bond teams up with the lone survivor of a destroyed Russian research center to stop the hijacking of a nuclear space weapon by a fellow agent formerly believed to be dead.This film brings James Bond into the post-Soviet era, so the old balance of power is not quite the same. But, in many ways, it has not changed at all, and the Russians are still key adversaries. It's complicated.Brosnan is a good Bond. I didn't grow up watching the series, but if I did he would have been my generation's Bond. And, frankly, he's pretty good. Maybe not as iconic as Connery or Moore, but it's hard to step into the shoes of giants. With ll due respect to Daniel Craig, I think Brosnan was (as of 2017) the last great Bond.",GoldenEye
7,lee_eisenberg,"By this time, the franchise had overstayed its welcome mat.",5,16 May 2006,"If you ask me, they should have just stopped making the ""James Bond"" movies after Sean Connery left. None of the other people who played Bond were ever able to equal Connery's appeal. Pierce Brosnan has done many good roles (namely ""Mars Attacks!""), and he's clearly a good guy in real life, but in my opinion, he's just not the right person to play Bond; no one except Sean Connery ever was.Anyway, the plot - or whatever it is - in ""GoldenEye"" involves Bond trying to stop a renegade Russian general from using nukes to attack England. That's the official story, but it's really an excuse for a series of gimmicks. There's the whole opening sequence, plus the whole end sequence. These sorts of things would work in a Jackie Chan movie, but here they look ridiculous.Are there any redeeming qualities? Well, the women are pretty hot (as the Bond girls always are). Here, there's Natalya Semyonova (Izabella Scorupco) and Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen, aka Jean Grey in ""X Men""). Judi Dench gets her first spin as M, and she's really the most interesting character in the whole movie. Desmond Llewellyn returns as Q. As for the rest of the cast, they're what we expect: the Russians are suspicion-inducing, the Brits are hoity-toity, and the Americans are dimwits. I guess that the world is always going to believe that.Anyway, my advice is to avoid this abomination and stick with the early Bond flicks. I can't understand why they're now remaking ""Casino Royale""; John Huston's version was very well done. But avoid ""GoldenEye"". Also starring Sean Bean, Joe Don Baker, Robbie Coltrane (aka Hagrid in the ""Harry Potter"" movies), Alan Cumming and Tcheky Karyo.",GoldenEye
8,jboothmillard,GoldenEye,9,4 March 2005,"The last time we saw James Bond was 1989 with Timothy Dalton. Six years later 007 finally returned with another new face, the great Irishman Pierce Brosnan. Bond is out of the cold war and now lives in the real 20th century and faces today's world filled with terrorism, tanks, bombs and missiles. He faces the nasty and well played villain Sean Bean as Alec Travalian, the big twist that he used to be his partner, hence the name Janis. Travalian has stolen a weapon called the GoldenEye (which was the name of Ian Fleming's house), capable of destructing a whole country. Bond later meets the gorgeous Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova (Polish actress Izabella Scorupco) who assists him in finding this weapon. Also starring Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp, Joe Don Baker as Jack Wade (who returned in Tomorrow Never Dies), Robbie Coltrane as Valentin Zukovsky (who returned in The World Is Not Enough), Alan Cumming as Boris Grishenko, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Samantha Bond as the new Miss Moneypenny, Michael Kitchen as Bill Tanner and Dame Judi Dench as the new female M. Filled with marvellous stunts, the Aston Martin DB5, and very good action sequences this is a very good start for the new Bond. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Effects and Best Sound. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Dame Judi Dench was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, she was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actresses, and she was number 8 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 11 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for Tina Turner's (written by Bono and The Edge) title song.

9,ccthemovieman-1,"Wow, What An Opening.....But After That?",6,2 March 2006,"Perhaps the best part of this 130-minute film is the first 10.5 minutes. It's so spectacular that the rest of the film almost becomes a letdown.When I first saw this 10 years ago, I thought that opening action scene, capped by the most outrageous stunt I had seen to that point in film - Bond falling off a cliff and catching up in mid-flight to a falling airplane, landing in the cockpit and righting the plane - was, of course, ridiculous but great fun to watch.The rest of the film is more typical Bond silliness with far less spectacular scenes. When it comes to gadgets, sexual innuendos, unrealistic action with Bond escaping from impossible situations, lots of pretty women and exotic scenery to ogle, these James Bond films always give plenty of the above. Sad to say, in this film, the dialog is much dumber than usual and the fake Russian accents are hard to decipher which is very annoying.One good point: there is almost no profanity in this film, even minor stuff....but overall, it's just a ""fair"" Bond flick. decent but nothing to write home about, except to note that it was Pierce Brosnan's debut as Bond and he is fine in that role.",GoldenEye
10,Tweekums,Brosnan's best Bond film,8,16 October 2012,"A lot has happened since 'Licence to Kill'; not only has Timothy Dolton been replaced by Pierce Brosnan but the Soviet Union is no more; but this doesn't mean you can't have villainous Russians any more. The prologue took place six years previously when the Soviet Union still existed; it featured Bond dramatically breaking into a Soviet installation where he is joined by 006, his friend Alex Trevelyan; the mission is a success but before he escapes Bond sees 006 being shot in the head by General Ourumov.Once the action has switched to the present Bond has a run in with Xenia Onnatopp, a member of the criminal Janus group. She steals a prototype advanced helicopter; it is special because unlike other aircraft it is shielded from EM radiation. The next time the helicopter is seen it is at a remote Russian facility; the home of the GoldenEye satellite based EM pulse weapon. When it lands Onnatopp and Ourumov get out and kill the people working there; with two exceptions; Boris Grishenko, the inside man and Natalya Simonova a programmer who just got lucky and survived. Before departing with the weapon's control unit they use one of the satellites to destroy the facility. Bond heads to St. Petersburg to meet the leader of the Janus group and when he finds him he has quite a surprise! Meanwhile Natalya has made her way to St. Petersburg and met her 'friend' Boris... this leads to Bond and Natalya meeting each other... just before they going to be killed! Needless to say they escape and after a series of spectacular incidents they confront Janus again; this time in Cuba.After the light-hearted Roger Moore era things got more serious for Timothy Dalton's two films; clearly they have gone someway back again although this still more serious than the Moore era films. There is a lot of impressive action including dramatic shootouts, explosions and a chase through St. Petersburg where Bond is driving a tank... and it was actually filmed in St. Petersburg... growing up I certainly never thought I'd see a Bond film made in Russia! The story is standard Bond fare but there is nothing wrong with that; it is after all a winning formula. Brosnan makes a good Bond and this is probably his best outing in the role. Izabella Scorupco and Famke Janssen were good as Natalya and Onnatopp although the latter's character was a bit too over the top; it looked liked she was about to climax as she gunned people down let alone when she killed somebody in bed! There was a nice twist midway through when we learn who Janus was so to avoid spoiling it I won't say who played Janus but will say I thought he did a decent job. There were some silly moments I could have done without but they weren't enough to really detract from this fine romp of a film.",GoldenEye

12,BA_Harrison,They make us wait 6-and-a-half years and what do we get?,5,9 December 2012,"Remington Steele vs Sharpe, that's what!Worse still, we get a dumb opening that hints at the kind of horrors still to come (Bond free-falling faster than a plane almost rivalling Die Another Day's wave-riding and invisible car for stupidity), a lifeless rendition of the 007 theme, Bond swapping his Aston Martin for a BMW (and a crap one at that), a bland Bond woman in the form of Isabella Scorupco, shocking product placement (Perrier anyone?), Bond blowing away innocent Russians left, right and centre; and an ending even more daft than the beginning, Bond's survival resting on the click of a pen by one of the series' most irritating characters, computer nerd Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming).There are a few compensations—a truly breath-taking 700+ft bungee jump from a dam kicks proceedings off in fine style; Famke Janssen is awesome as Xenia Onatopp, a sexy killer with thighs to die for; and the film's action highlight, a tank chase scene through the streets (and buildings) of St.Petersburg, is a brilliantly orchestrated orgy of destruction—but overall I can't but feel terribly underwhelmed and more than a bit disappointed by Goldeneye.",GoldenEye
13,blanche-2,Brosnan's Debut as Bond,7,19 March 2010,"Some years after the end of his hit series, ""Remington Steele,"" Pierce Brosnan finally got the chance to play Bond and utter those immortal words, ""Bond. James Bond."" His first attempt was subverted by the producers of ""Steele."" The Bond series had been on a hiatus.The film begins in the '80s, when Bond and Agent 006 are found within a chemical weapons plant in the Soviet Union. 006 is murdered. Nine years later, Bond plays chicken with a woman driving near Monte Carlo. Her name is, in true Bond fashion, Xenia Onatopp, and she is connected to a crime syndicate in St. Petersburg. He's assigned to watch her, but she manages to steal the Tiger, a helicopter impervious to any attack. But Onatopp's and her cohorts' real goal is GoldenEye, a satellite weapon, which is responsible for some awesome special effects in the film.Brosnan stars with Famke Janssen, Sean Bean, Judi Dench, Alan Cumming, and Robbie Coltrane. Brosnan is at the height of his Black Irish handsomeness here. He looks great but doesn't exhibit much in the way of personality. I'm not an expert on James Bonds, but I'm guessing there was no one like Sean Connery. As Steele, Brosnan had great charm and a wonderful sense of comedy. With better direction, he might have been able to strike a better balance in the role.Even back in 1995, James Bond was a franchise that had probably seen better days. However, it goes on now with Daniel Craig, so audiences still like it.As a bit of trivia, Pierce Brosnan was both the slimmest James Bond and the heaviest, going from 164 to 211 pounds in the 7 years he played Bond. This is possibly because he quit smoking in the late '90s.",GoldenEye
14,edwagreen,**1/2,6,21 March 2015,"Our Bond films always work under the theme that there is someone or some organization seeking to create a catastrophe in the world and this film falls right into that traditional way of thinking.We get a chance to meet 006 here and would never imagine that a colleague and friend of 007 is such a villain.I just love the slick dialogue in this film and all other Bond flicks. When the female villain in dead on a tree, James states that ""she always loved a tight squeeze,"" and Moneypenny's thought that while Bond is in his usual comfort position with the opposite sex, that he is on top of the situation.There are endless crises scenes of explosions and other mayhem, but we've come to expect that in these kinds of films.",GoldenEye
15,BandSAboutMovies,Good return!,7,17 April 2020,"After Licence to Kill was released, pre-production work for the seventeenth James Bond film - the third to star Timothy Dalton - began. There was even a poster shown at Cannes. But soon, producer Albert R.

MGM/UA was sold to Pathé Entertainment, who attempted to sell off the broadcast rights to the studios films to pay for the buy out. The problem was that they were selling them for firesale prices and were denying Danjaq any of the profits.By the time the legal issues were settled, six years had passed. While Dalton was still Broccoli's choice to play Bond, the star's original three-movie, seven-year contract expired in 1993. That means that Pierce Brosnan could finally be Bond.John Woo was originally selected to direct, but Martin Campbell - who directed two Zorro films, two Bond films and, perhaps not so successfully, the Green Lantern movie - finally took over.This is the first Bond film to be made after the fall of Communism. One of the movie's big changes was to cast Judi Dench as the new female M, who refers to Bond as a ""sexist, misogynist dinosaur"" and a ""relic of the Cold War."" The fall of Russian is also shown in the opening titles, which upset plenty of people in those countries to see the symbols of their past decimated by girls in bikinis.GoldenEye begins with James Bond and Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean) infiltrating a chemical weapons facility in Russia. Trevelyan is caught and presumably killed by Colonel Ourumov. While Bond manages to destroy the site before escaping, the truth is that Trevelyan and Ourumov come together to create the Janus crime syndicate.Famke Janssen makes for a great henchwoman as Xenia Onatopp, a fighter pilot and killer who loves to crush men between her thighs. She's awesome in this and even did all of her own driving stunts. There are also great turns by Joe Don Baker, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Cumming.So what is GoldenEye, other than Ian Fleming's estate? It's a satellite that the Russians are using to destroy targets with a nuclear electromagnetic pulse.Perhaps more people in the U.S. know this movie as the inspiration for the Nintendo 64 game, which was a huge multiplayer game.This is a film of many firsts and lasts. The first Bond film to use CGI. The first to switch the roles of Moneypenny, M and Bond all in the same film. And the last that Albert Broccoli would live to see. Luckily, with Brosnan, the series was in stable hands.",GoldenEye

19,hitchcockthelegend,"James Bond. Charming, sophisticated secret agent. ""Shaken, but not disturbed.""",8,17 July 2012,"GoldenEye is directed by Martin Campbell and adapted to screenplay by Jeffrey Caine and Bruce Feirstein from a Michael France story that uses characters created by Ian Fleming. It stars Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, Sean Bean, Izabella Scorupco and Famke Jansen. Music is scored by Eric Serra and cinematography by Phil Meheux.Bond 17, 007 and his friend Alec Trevelyan (006) are assigned to destroy a Soviet chemical weapons installation but the mission goes awry and 006 is executed. Forward 9 years later and Bond is sent by M to locate a weapons system called GoldenEye that may have fallen into dangerous hands. Travelling into new Russia, Bond unearths a fiendish plot involving the GoldenEye and a face from the past threatens to usurp his efforts.With the lengthy litigation issues between Eon and MGM/UA finally resolved, a new Bond went into production 6 years after Licence to Kill was released. By now Timothy Dalton had moved on to other things and had amicably left the role he so respected. This let in Pierce Brosnan, finally, someone who had long courted the role and was agonised to miss out on it back in 1986. A very popular choice, Brosnan would be the spearhead of a new strategy to update Bond for the 1990s. Michael France came up with a story involving new Russia since the Cold War had ended, the new M was to be played by a woman (Dench) and a dynamite cast assembled for the picture. Even a new studio was built at Leavesden, this because Pinewood had been taken over by another production-Sean Connery's First Knight! Press conferences went well, hopes were high that Bond could remain a viable action franchise in the mid to late 1990s.""I might as well ask you if all those vodka martinis ever silence the screams of all the men you've killed... or if you find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women for all the dead ones you failed to protect.""GoldenEye proved to be a great Bond film because the makers got most of the key elements right. They managed to freshen up things by way of the astute casting of Dench, the new Moneypenny (Samantha Bond) was appealingly feisty and they gave Brosnan a script perfectly tailored to his talents. Crucially the classic elements of previous Bond productions are deftly incorporated as well, exotic locations (Monte Carlo, Puerto Rico), tough and sexy Bond girls, gadgets, many different vehicles, strongly played villains and Bond also has to use brain and brawn at times. There are many who love the gadget side of Bond, and many who prefer him as an intelligent and tough human being, GoldenEye caters for both sides of the fence. One minute he's using a headbut to escape from a perilous cockpit situation, the next he's got a laser watch to get out of another deathtrap. Something for all here. There's also some edginess in the script, a truly great passage as Bond and M drink Bourbon, you can cut the atmosphere with a knife, a dialogue exchange about Cossacks where an acknowledgement comes from Bond that carries real weight and the barbed observations that Trevelyan throws Bond's way. While it's great to see a ruthless Bond in the final showdown. This is often mature and potent stuff.Brosnan does great work, handsome, athletic and a magnetic screen presence, hell he even managed to carry off the witty one-liners that so many Bond fans seem to love. He is helped immensely by the cast put around him. Bean plays off of Brosnan very well and their interactions sparkle, while Dench wonderfully brings back the tension and respect aspects of M and Bond confrontations not seen since the Bernard Lee years. Scorupco gives Natalya Simonova great courage and cynical bite, nice to note that she never once glams up, she's always in her standard clothes as she tags along with Bond amongst the carnage. The stunningly sexy Jansen gets a villainess role of a lifetime as Xenia Onatop, a complete bad ass who gets sexual pleasure from death and destruction, she smokes cigars and dresses with an erotic kink. Gottfried John (General Ourumov), Robbie Coltrane (Valentin Zukovsky) and Tcheky Karyo (Dimitri Mishkin) skillfully act out their respective roles. While Desmond Llewelyn as Q engages in only the way he can.Problems? Yes. Trevelyan's motives are a bit weak, nigh on unbelievable in fact. Alan Cumming's nerdy computer geek is annoying and at odds with the strong characters around him, and a couple of ludicrous deaths hark back to the cartoon parts of Roger Moore's era. While we definitely could have done with more Coltrane! Major problem is the score from Serra, as part of the ""refreshing"" process for a new Bond era, the makers brought in Serra to provide an experimental score, it doesn't work, the themes are out of sync with a Bond movie. Even his end credit song is wrong, he sings it himself and closes down a great action movie with puffy romantic strains. A shame since the title song is a strong one, belted out by Tina Turner and written by Bono & The Edge of U2 fame. No matter, GoldenEye survives the missteps to become a part of the upper echelons of Bond movies. Crammed with high energy action (Martin Campbell proving adept in this department, tank chaos a pure delight) and amazing stunts (oh my that leap off the dam), rich Bondian characters and top end production value, all sit nicely alongside a new and popular James Bond actor.The worldwide box office sang to the tune of an incredible £351 million, proving once again that when Bond's viability as a box office draw is called into question, nobody actually does it better. 8.5/10",GoldenEye
20,Theo Robertson,The Irony Is Enjoyable,7,15 January 2003,"Say what you like about the Bond franchise ( And in my opinion I don`t have a lot of good things to say ) but the series never came out with the old cliche of having those nasty pinko commies as the bad guys . Bond`s enemies where always the fictional SPECTRE or mad scientist types , not that this was always successful of course . But I did enjoy the ironic fact that this new Bond starts his first filmed mission with an attack on a secret USSR base . Even better in this respect is the title sequence where we see the demise of communist icons and as the story progresses we find out the bad guys are ex-communists turned quasi mafia , and the motivation of the main baddie involves a cold war betrayal . All this gives GOLDENEYE a sense of time and place , something that can`t be said for most - If any - Bond films.GOLDENEYE is a very good Bond film even if it`s not up to classics like DR NO or GOLDFINGER . The production values are certainly a million times better than what we saw in the 80s . Brosnan is fairly good but lacks that serious touch that Dalton and Connery had . The only other complaint I have is that tank sequence which is very silly and interferes with the pace of the film . The one thing that puzzled me though is the main villain . He`s played by an actor far too young to have born in the 1940s . I know Anthony Hopkins was to have been originally cast in this role but if that was the case would he have been required to have a really brutal punch up with Bond at the climax ?",GoldenEye

24,Boba_Fett1138,Not just one of the best Bond's but also one of the best action movies of all time.,10,22 May 2005,"I absolutely adore this movie. What a comeback for Bond, after the Timothy Dalton Bond's the franchise had been officially declared death by many and no one expected another Bond movie. This movie perfectly sets the mood for the future Bond movies for the 90's and this decade. The action is what makes this movie in a way more of this time. In a way the Bond franchise matured and became a competitor at the box office's again. Still all the 'old' Bond elements are all present once more in this movie and it still stays loyal to the franchise so many grew up with watching.The villains are the best ever in a Bond movie since ""Goldfinger"". Funny because this movie is also the in my opinion the best Bond movie since ""Goldfinger"". I think that tells something about how important the Bond villains always are for Bond movies. Sean Bean is a memorable and worthy nemesis for Bond and Alan Cumming is an excellent and fun 'villain'. But most memorable is Famke Janssen with literally the most deathliest hips to hit the screen. The movie really launched the career for those three actors, which is no coincidence I think...Pierce Brosnan simply is Bond, from the moment you first see him. He's got the charms and humor, the two most important elements for the Bond character to me.The movie introduces some nice new characters that would later return in other Bond movies. Judi Dench plays the new M, Joe Don Baker plays the fun character Jack Wade and Robbie Coltrane plays the highly enjoyable 'villain' Valentin Zukovsky. Izabella Scorupco isn't exactly the most memorable Bond girl or actress but still she is likable in this movie.I now it is criticized a lot but I really like Eric Serra's musical score. I wouldn't had mind him scoring more Bond movie.The pace is action-movie like high and features some extremely good action sequence's. From the spectacular opening to the just as spectacular ending, this movie provides non-stop entertainment, action and a great story that never gets complex but still is compelling and exciting.

25,oscaralbert,If being water-boarded at Guantanamo is his idea of fun . . .,7,5 September 2014,". . . then James Bond is in for a jolly time as GOLDENEYE closes. Of course, a comeuppance is past due for this inept womanizer, who's seen here playing ""boys with toys"" for 130 minutes. Yep, when he should be nipping Osama bin Laden in the bud (remember, this flick is set in 1995), Agent 007 is driving tanks through Russian apartment buildings and crushing rush hour commuters instead. The theme of GOLDENEYE, as was the case for most of the previous Bond film outings, is that you can never trust a Russian. (Since it's common knowledge that these bozos never have been capable of getting a warhead close to the U.S. mainland, the fact that we've not yet nuked them suggests that it's the Americans who are riddled with traitors; we even are ignoring our promise to the Ukraine from the 1900s when we bamboozled them into giving up their own hundreds of nukes that we would reduce Moscow to rubble with the U.S. nuclear umbrella if any unwanted Russian ever set foot in their homeland!) While some of the stunt work--such as the opening bungee jump off the dam--continues to impress in GOLDENEYE, many of the cheap explosive ""special"" effects seem like throwbacks to the 1960s. With its writing and plotting also clearly targeted at Pre-teen boys, it's a wonder that there have been SIX MORE Bond flicks produced since the release of GOLDENEYE.",GoldenEye
26,Uriah43,First James Bond Film to Feature Pierce Brosnan,6,23 June 2016,"This is the first film to feature Pierce Brosnan in the role of ""James Bond"" and I must say that he was an excellent choice for the role. Now, that's not to suggest anything negative about any of his predecessors as I thought they all did quite well too. In any case, this film begins with James Bond (as ""Agent 007"") and his colleague ""Alec Trevelyan-Agent 006"" (Sean Bean) infiltrating a Russian chemical munitions plant with orders to destroy it. Unfortunately, Agent 006 is killed in the process and James Bond barely manages to escape from certain death. Nine years later, James Bond has orders to investigate a Russian crime syndicate called ""Janus"" which MI-6 believes has had some involvement with a Canadian admiral. Sure enough, a female assassin named ""Xenia Onatopp"" (Famke Janssen) kills the admiral in order to acquire his identity card. Once this is done she then kills a couple of pilots and steals a state-of-the-art helicopter and flies it to Siberia. The reason for doing all of this is in order to obtain a top-secret electro-magnetic satellite weapons system known as ""Goldeneye"" which is maintained at a small station in Severnaya, Siberia. Upon obtaining the equipment needed for Goldeneye it is then revealed that this crime syndicate now has the ability to wipe out all electronic equipment and data for any metropolitan area in the world. Needless to say, this is a serious concern for MI-6 and ""M"" (Judi Dench) puts all of the resources available to her on the case. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film features quite a bit of action, stunts and pyrotechnics. So those who enjoy movies of this type will probably love this particular picture. On the flip side though, while it had a lot of sparkle it lacked the necessary realism and depth that would have made it so much better. For example, one specific scene had an unmanned airplane in flight with James Bond descending toward it from a cliff. Not only does he manage to get inside but he also finds a way to avert an inevitable crash and then simply fly away. It was all so preposterous. And this is just one example. Again, those viewers who require lots of action will love this movie. Although I liked it to a certain degree, I still feel it could have been better had it had a more coherent plot and a sense of realism. For those reasons I have rated this movie accordingly.

29,HotToastyRag,Best Bond movie ever,10,14 February 2021,"It's sentimental favorite time here at Hot Toasty Rag. GoldenEye is the best James Bond movie ever. I excuse my sentimental statement for two reasons: One, because everyone believes the actor who portrayed James Bond when they were kids was the best and will never be equaled. Two, because I really haven't seen another 007 movie that was better than the first I watched. I'll never forget going to the movie theaters on Thanksgiving weekend to see it with my family. Since my previous movie theater outings were Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, going to see a real-people movie was a big deal. I thought Pierce Brosnan was so handsome, he wasn't a real person: he must be a Ken doll brought to life and put up on the big screen.With no knowledge that the 007 movies were a series, the opening credits and classic theme were magical. The first ""Bond, James Bond"", the first martini, the introduction of each spy gadget... Pierce Brosnan was the perfect Bond; even those who grew up with someone else and feel obliged to name him as their favorite readily admit to the '90s Bond as the second-best. Even though I've seen him in a million other movies, he'll always be James Bond. He's just too classy, handsome, charming, and perfect to be anybody else. And, to this day, whenever I see Sean Bean in the opening credits of a movie I say, ""Oo, it's 006!"" I'm sure it's not how these fine actors wish to be remembered, but that's what sentimentality does.From an un-sentimental perspective, GoldenEye is pretty hilarious. And James Bond movies are supposed to be charmingly humorous, aren't they? The Russians are the bad guys, the click of a pen can destroy the world, and the villainess finds beating people up an aphrodisiac. But when you're not chuckling, you can appreciate the awesome action sequences, the introduction of Judi Dench as M, and the adorable Izabella Scorupco as the Bond girl. How adorable is her haircut (and how '90s)? Ever since I saw this movie, I wanted to cut my hair; but I had to wait ten years before my parents let me.

This one has lots of action and lots of good characters.  Sean Bean is great as the Bond villain in this one and so is Famke Jannsen also a baddie.  The story revolves around a Russian weapon called goldeneye, which has the ability to knock out anything with an electrical circuit in a 30-mile radius.  Bond has to do a lot to get this weapon back including infiltrating the base of the Bond bad guy.  There is also a great scene where Bond uses a tank to chase the bad guys and demolishes downtown Moscow in the process.

32,The_Void,A golden start for Pierce Brosnan!,8,2 January 2007,"GoldenEye is often reputed to be the best of Pierce Brosnan's outings as Bond, and one of the best of the series period. There is a reason for this. Brosnan and director Martin Campbell had a big job on their hands - reinventing Bond for the nineties while still retaining that classic Bond atmosphere can't be easy, but it's safe to say that they achieved this aim admirably. Brosnan would actually go on to become one of my least favourite Bonds with subsequent outings, but here he fits the lead role like a glove. The plot is typically overblown, but I'm sure nobody would want it any other way. The plot focuses on a rumoured nuclear weapon named 'GoldenEye', and, as always, it is up to James Bond to sort it out. He teams up with a female survivor of an attack on a Russian research centre by Russian agent Xenia Onatopp, under the orders of General Ourumov. Together Bond and the girl discover the location of the nuclear device, but it soon becomes apparent that there's more than just a terrorist plot at work as the man behind the plot wants revenge on Great Britain.The thing that sets GoldenEye apart from later Brosnan Bonds is that it features a plot line that is interesting throughout, and one that doesn't ever become silly. Director Martin Campbell excellently fuses this plot with a barrage of special effect sequences, the majority of which are spectacular and engaging. The support characters on display are strong this time round, with Alan Cumming providing entertainment as a Russian researcher, while fellow Brits Sean Bean, Judi Dench and Robbie Coltrane jump on the Bond bandwagon with gusto. The female talent comes in the form of the lovelies Famke Janssen and Izabella Scorupco, both of which provide enough in the way of eye-candy. The way that most of the Russian roles have been cast with British actors works better than you would think too, as all the talented performers do well in their respective roles. The plot of GoldenEye may not hold much weight in terms of substance or emotion, but the Bond series isn't meant to - and Martin Campbell has successfully captured that fun, over the top and entertaining style that James Bond needs, and made it work for a nineties audience.",GoldenEye
33,mm-39,Looks better second time around,7,16 January 2002,"I was in a stressful mood, while watching this film.  It may affect my review, but I found the movie not that bad.  Bronson's performance was much better then Daltons, and creates a upward movement for Jame Bond.  M is a women now, and the series shows signs of change with out being too politically correct.  Bond is called a dinasor by the new M, but is a likable one.  The story jells well, and the action scene with the tank is interesting, but I believe they had to retake the ending of this film because its ending was to simular to True Lies.  I could see this with the ending, and it took away from the film.  One we do not see if the Russian generial was killed,(a bad guy) and M showed the stinger missiles in his car which is never used.  Bond movies never leave these holes in them.  Well a good first start out.",GoldenEye
34,Mr-Fusion,A high point for the lead and the series,9,14 October 2013,"""GoldenEye"" -my favorite of the Brosnan era- is the movie that made me a James Bond fan to begin with. It successfully reignited the franchise with new blood, a new star, and that they set it against the backdrop of post-Cold War Russia lends the movie a distinct sense of character. The film hits all the right notes on big action setpieces: an awesome cold open, the tank chase, Severnaya's destruction and the fight on the satellite dish. Great stunts, and Serra's atmospheric score sets this apart from the other Brosnan entries. And Pierce plays the icon with cold assassin's eyes, yet with self- deprecating ease (the guy also wears the hell outta those suits). And he's backed by a pretty great cast: the smokin' Izabella Scorupco, Sean Bean, Alan Cumming, Famke Janssen, Joe Don Baker, Robbie Coltrane (Zukovsky's a great character) and the marvelously ball-busting Judi Dench. The only disappointment in the movie is the underuse of the Z3 . . . or maybe Q was just jerking Bond's chain and never actually installed those stinger missiles. This movie's an A effort, and although it lacks the hard-hitting magic of ""Casino Royale"", Martin Campbell really did bring Bond roaring back to the big screen. Some of the techno thriller angle is quaint for today (oh man, 14.4 modems!), but on the whole, ""GoldenEye"" wears its time well. 9/10",GoldenEye
35,SimonJack,Brosnan and Russian plot give a lift to the James Bond series,9,24 January 2018,"With each of the major changes in actors for the James Bond roll, the producers have made one or two other notable changes as well. One that seems to be consistent is a stepping up of action. That seems to keep pace with the shift in the industry overall. Fewer dramatic films are being made, and fewer real life stories are made into movies, in favor of fast-paced, action-packed films to entertain the senses of sight and sound. So it is with ""GoldenEye,"" and the introduction of Pierce Brosnan as Double-0-Seven secret agent James Bond. But another change is here as well. It has a return to more subtle comedy, in the form of quips, witty metaphors, and clever innuendo. This had been lacking in some of the recent 007 movies. In Brosnan, we still have a Bond who is a ladies man, who can think and who is tough on his feet. And, ""GoldenEye"" has a most interesting plot. With the fall of the Soviet Union five years before, movies made about and after the Cold War have intrigue and more appeal as realistic, compared to the fictional comic book or fantasy stories. Thus, this film scores high for more realistic possibilities, however far out. Altogether, this makes for a very entertaining film. It's the best of the Bond films in a long time. One other significant change with this film is the introduction of Judi Dench as M. Dench is a superb actress, whom I enjoy in a number of films. But having a hard as nails tough woman as head of MI6 doesn't work well. The push for political correctness was peaking around 1995. Dench seems to make the woman in the traditional male role harder than any man, and that opens a door to viewing women as monsters. Instead of the overly dour Dench, Helen Mirren would have brought a sense of stern no-nonsense with great intelligence and insight. Or, Vanessa Redgrave would have given the role a sense of intelligence and ability.For action, this film has a long tank chase scene in which Bond wreaks havoc on the streets of St. Petersburg behind the wheel of a huge Russian tank. A big chunk of the budget for this film must have been for the large number of cars crunched and other vehicles and building walls destroyed. Brosnan held the role of James Bond for four films over seven years. The next three would be ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" in 1997, ""The World is Not Enough"" in 1999, and ""Die Another Day"" in 2002. Here are some favorite lines from this film. For more funny dialog, see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page for the movie.

36,JamesHitchcock,Post-Soviet Bond,7,15 May 2009,"The producers of the Bond films had originally intended that Timothy Dalton should star in three films, but the third, provisionally titled ""The Property of a Lady"" was never made, for a number of reasons including legal disputes and the lack of success of the second Dalton episode, ""Licence to Kill"", at the box office. The result was a six-year hiatus, the longest ever gap in the series.During those six years after ""Licence to Kill"" opened in the summer of 1989, the world had seen many changes. The Cold War had ended, the Berlin Wall had fallen and the Soviet Union had collapsed. ""Goldeneye"" was therefore the first post-Soviet Bond. Yet these changes were not necessarily a disadvantage for the film-makers. While the works of more realistic spy writers such as John Le Carre and Len Deighton were mostly rooted in the espionage battles of the Cold War, Ian Fleming's hero had always done battle against a wide spectrum of villains, most of whom were neither Russian nor Eastern European, nor even Communist. Indeed, the makers of ""Goldeneye"" were able to turn the changes in the international political order to their advantage, setting the film in a post-Communist Russia. Even the opening titles depict the destruction of Soviet symbols such as the red star and hammer and sickle.In real life a goldeneye is a species of duck, but it was also the name of Fleming's Jamaican estate, which is doubtless the reason it was used as the title. (Its similarity to ""Goldfinger"" may also have been a factor). In the film ""Goldeneye"" is the name of a secret satellite weapon which has fallen into the hands of a Russian crime syndicate who intend to use it to blackmail the West. It falls, of course, to Bond to thwart this scheme.The six year gap between ""Goldeneye"" and its predecessor provided the producers with a chance to rethink the way in which the series was developing. It was the first Bond film to be based on an entirely original story; all previous episodes had had at least a nominal connection with a Fleming novel or short story. Only one actor, Desmond Llewelyn, returned from earlier episodes. Bond's superior M was played for the first time by a woman, Judi Dench, a development possibly inspired by the real-life appointment of Stella Rimington as the first female head of MI5. The most important change in casting was, of course, the appointment of Pierce Brosnan to succeed Dalton as Bond.The film also varies two important elements of the Bond formula, the villain and the Bond girl. Traditional Bond villains, like Gerd Frobe's Goldfinger or Michael Lonsdale's Drax, were mostly gloating megalomaniacs bent on world domination, surrounded by wicked henchmen and, occasionally, by glamorous but equally wicked henchwomen. Here we have not one main villain but a quartet. Colonel Ourumov is a rogue Russian officer reminiscent of Orlov in ""Octopussy"". Boris Grishenko is a brilliant but childish and sex-obsessed computer nerd. Alec Trevelyan is a renegade British intelligence officer of Cossack descent and a former friend of Bond, now heading a Russian crime syndicate. And finally there is Xenia Onatopp, the sexiest Bond villainess since Caroline Munro's Naomi in ""The Spy who Loved Me"". Onatopp is a beautiful but sadistic former KGB operative; her speciality is crushing men to death with her thighs while having sex with them.In the early films, although there were exceptions like Pussy Galore in ""Goldfinger"", Bond girls were normally bikini-clad bimbos like Ursula Andress' Honey Ryder. To try and make the films rather less sexist, during the Moore/Dalton era this characterisation was altered somewhat and the typical Bond girl became a bimbo actress trying to pass herself off as either a tough secret agent (Barbara Bach, Carey Lowell) or as a brainy scientist (Lois Chiles, Tania Roberts). In ""Goldfinger"" the heroine is an ordinary woman; Natalya Simonova is a relatively junior technician who is the only survivor when Ourumov's men attack and destroy the Goldeneye command centre. Realising that she is still in danger from them, Natalya makes common cause with Bond against the villains. Although Izabella Scorupco was very attractive, Natalya is one of the less glamorous heroines in the Bond canon, and this may explain why Scorupco has not gone on to become a major star, unlike Famke Janssen who played Onatopp and has since starred in films like ""X-Men"" and ""Don't Say a Word"". Something similar happened in ""The Spy who Loved Me"", where it was Munro rather than the film's ostensible heroine Bach who went on to greater success.Incidentally, in the later Brosnan films the scriptwriters returned to a more traditional conception of what a Bond villain or heroine should be; Jonathan Pryce in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and Toby Stephens in ""Die Another Day"" are both monstrous tycoons in the Goldfinger mode, and Denise Richards in ""The World Is Not Enough"" represented an unwelcome return to the bimbo-as-nuclear-physicist style of heroine.Although ""Die Another Day"" represented a falling-away of standards, Pierce Brosnan's first three episodes were considerably better than either of Dalton's or most of Roger Moore's later efforts. Much of the credit for this belongs to Brosnan himself, a stylish hero and neither too serious like Dalton nor too jokey as Moore could be at his worst. ""Goldeneye"", perhaps surprisingly, showed that the series, conceived in the early sixties, could still flourish in the very different world of the mid nineties. 7/10",GoldenEye

39,KineticSeoul,The Bond film that got me into the Bond films,8,11 February 2016,"This is my personal most nostalgic Bond movie in the franchise. Mainly because this is the film that got me interested in the Bond franchise. And because of the N64 video game which was a huge hit at the time. Martin Campbell the director of this film, really has got it down when it comes to directing ""007"" films. When this film first came out, it just had the right balance of everything when it comes to a Bond film. Honestly, I really don't get why some viewers of this franchise or even fans don't particularly give that much credit to Pierce Brosnan as 007. Some even rank him pretty low when it comes to ranking their favorite Bonds. To be very honest, Pierce Brosnan to me is the iconic Bond. Sure Daniel Craig portrayed it more closer to how Bond is in the novels. But Brosnan just seems to have the Bond look all around. Follow that with the Bond like charisma that is shown in the ""007"" films. And you got yourself a very entertaining and badass Bond to watch on screen. He really has that aura of confidence and alpha male type vibe that makes you pay attention when he is on screen. I personally think he is probably the best James Bond to hit the screen so far. Seriously, his screen presence is terrific as James Bond. ""GoldenEye"" is also the film that introduced the new female ""M"" played by Judi Dench. Who is portrayed as an ""M"" that doesn't take any crap from Bond and is tough, professional and likable. Mix that in with a pretty entertaining plot with a good build up and characters such as the villains that are memorable and stand out. I think they made a smart decision at the time making computers and hacking a big part of the story. Since when this film came out it was a point in time where computers were becoming necessities. Overall with everything together you got yourself a top class Bond film. This isn't just a great Bond film, but it's a excellent action movie that I would recommend checking out. Also play the game if you haven't yet, it's a true classic as well.8.5/10",GoldenEye
40,OllieSuave-007,Pierce Brosnan's 007 first.,7,11 March 2014,"This is Pierce Brosnan's first movie as James Bond 007. Here, after a deadly satellite weapon system falls into the wrong hands, Bond races to Russia to search for the stolen access codes to the space weapon ""Goldeneye,"" which can fire an electromagnetic pulse toward Earth. At the same time Bond is pitted against colleague-turned-enemy Alec Trevelyan.There are some nice action sequences and thrilling stunt scenes, and Alex Trevelyan (Sean Bean) and Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) make a pretty notorious team of villains, deviously depicted who will have you rooting against. However, I thought the Russian formula in the plot is a little overused in the series by this time. And, while Brosnan makes a good action hero, he didn't quite have the charm, class and suaveness as Connery and Moore had as Bond. The one-liners and wit that defines Bond were few in this film.Overall, it is not a bad Bond entry. It's an OK action film, but minus some of the classic 007 flavor.Grade B-",GoldenEye
41,FeastMode,my notes,4,26 June 2019,"I used to absolutely LOVE this movie and played the video game like crazy. After watching it again, it does not stand the test of time. There was a LOT in this movie that was outdated and it had some old-movie-qualities. The action was still pretty good and the acting and directing was pretty good. But there was a lot of dumb stuff, and it just didn't impress me at all. this was my first time watching it in probably over ten years. I always thought the old Bond's were better than the newer Daniel Craig ones but I was completely wrong (about 5 viewings)",GoldenEye
42,Lejink,Piercing guy,6,26 March 2014,"Enter Brosnan. I remember having my doubts at the time regarding the latest new Bond, not imagining how TV's rather effete Remington Steele could transform into the all-conquering 007. But fair play to Irishman Brosnan, he does an excellent job, he has the looks, charm and devil-meant the character needs and is clearly up to the physical challenges (in more ways than one) of the job.Judi Dench also makes her first appearance as M, but I'm less keen on her. I get the modernising gender-busting update of her character but it feels contrived to me and I don't sense her engagement with the role. Sean Bean, probably a candidate at the time for the lead, obviously harbours no grudge at coming up 001 short with a strong performance as rogue agent Alex Trevelyan. Robbie Coltrane delivers a nice cameo as an old rival Russian agent.The action sequences are suitably over-the-top, Bond's bungee jump at the start getting there long before Tom Cruise's ""M. I."" team, plus there are lots of boy's toys for James to indulge himself with, including a gravity-defying plane manoeuvre, a hair-raising race outside Monaco and of course he gets to cause mayhem in of all things a tank in yet another death-defying escape. Yes, product placement is everywhere you look, but that's the name of the game these days, I suppose.Both Bond-girls are Russian too, with the sex scenes now more adult and rougher than before, indeed an aged American admiral is literally squeezed to death between the legs of his seductress although James naturally extricates himself from a similar fate later in the film. The wise-cracks could have been better and as usual with Bond, the movie runs on too long but with first- class special effects not to mention one of the better theme tunes, as U2's Bono and Edge do a Shirley Bassey make-over on Tina Turner, this was a strong re-entry by the franchise, just when it needed it most.",GoldenEye
43,bowmanblue,Bond – the Next Generation,8,7 August 2017,"For whatever reason, and despite Ian Flemming himself stating that Timothy Dalton was the closest interpretation to Bond that he'd seen, Dalton left the iconic role after only two films (which weren't as bad as some people like to make out!). And, the role of the super-spy went to the man producers had been trying to attract for some time – Pierce Brosnan. And, although it's probably fair to say that when people look back on the history of Bond, he too wouldn't be described as many people's 'favourite' Bond, he did make advances in bringing the franchise right up to date.Right from the beginning we meet our new Bond bungee jumping into a Russian base. Now, I know these days most people know what bungee jumping looks like, but, back in 1995, it was actually quite an event seeing it done on the big screen. Yes, the plot isn't anything we haven't seen before, i.e. a Russian presence trying to exact revenge on the West, but it's just so new seeing such a 'modern' Bond. Gone are the days of blatantly 'blue-screening' the action behind the actors and now Bond can happily sky-dive into a falling plane and make it look real (well, as real as jumping into a falling plane and piloting it to safety can look!). I feel like I have to dwell on this 'modern feel' because it is this film's major change from previous incarnations. The action looks better, the chases are more fantastical (the 'tank chase' being the highlight!) – it's just totally Bond for the new nineties generation.The ever-wonderful 'Q' is on hand to smooth over the transition of old to new Bond, but the modern feel is not just helped by (another) new Moneypenny, but also having a female M, brilliantly played by Judi Dench, who states much of the criticism that's been levelled at Bond throughout the franchise, i.e. he's a misogynistic relic of a bygone age! Add great supporting performances from Sean Bean, Robbie Coltrane and Famke Jannsen (a henchwoman who likes to crush her victims between her thighs in the heat of – er – 'passion' and you have an action-spy movie that really roles along nice. As I mentioned, the plot isn't anything spectacular, but the overall look, feel, cast and a wonderfully-snarling rendition of the title song 'Goldeneye' by a Tina Turner at her best, really elevates what – by rights – is nothing more than an average movie to one that really feels like the Bond franchise has been given a shot in the arm.'Goldeneye' may not be technically the greatest of the long-running saga, but it certainly cements its place in the franchise by being the most different from what came before it. It's definitely worth a watch if you're a fan and should even entertain casual fans of the action genre. Oh, and did I mention that Pierce Brosnan is also pretty damn good as the lead? He keeps the wry charm of Roger Moore and the ability to add just the right amount of humour to the role without it becoming a parody of itself. Plus he's believable enough as an action hero when he's gunning down hordes of faceless Russian hoods. Overall, a damn fine ride.",GoldenEye
44,ThomasDrufke,Betrayal,6,31 October 2015,"If the Timothy Dalton films weren't convincing enough, the tongue and cheek tone is seemingly gone from the franchise, and that's probably for the best. But GoldenEye suffers at times because of it's lack of fun at all. Pierce Brosnan finally gets his chance at playing 007 after two separate close encounters previously. This was also the longest gap in between Bond films, 1989-1995, to date. GoldenEye attempts to modernize and boost the stakes to the series after two very serious films with Dalton.Brosnan brings charm but surprisingly not a ton of charisma, or at least not compared to Connery or Moore. But then again, not many do. We also have performances from Famke Janssen, Sean Bean, and the newcomer to the series Judi Dench. Out of everyone, Dench is by far the most notable in that she's the first 'M' to really put Bond in his place. She's the only 'M' that I actually believed was his boss. You can't pull one over on the dame herself. But although I like Janssen in most roles, I was kind of annoyed by her for most of the film. She didn't seem to fit in with the tone of the rest of the film so therefore not a very good villain. Her killing technique is one of the strangest things I have ever seen. It's a shame because the potential was all there.Sean Bean on the other-hand, is always fun to watch. His turn from being 006 and Bond's friend to the leader of a nuclear space weapon seemed both original and familiar. I liked that a villain came from somewhere personal to Bond, but I also feel like it could have had more build up within their friendship instead of hiding him for half the film. That way, the gut punch will hurt more if we would have cared about these two working together. Plus, how many times have we seen a nuclear motivated villain in this series anyway? I also don't believe the 9 year time jump was in any way necessary. Considering that both of these two are MI6 agents, I would have liked more than a few minutes of hand to hand combat.This film is beloved by many people, but I hardly believe it's one of the best Bond films. It's action is marvelous though so unrealistic at times i.e. the spectacular pre-credits sequence. The acting with exception of Janssen is very good. There's just a few too many mishaps with the pacing and lack of interesting female characters (with the exception of Dench of course) among other things. it's a formidable spy film, it's just nothing special, especially among the greatness of this franchise.+Dench brings needed gravitas+Bean is so fun to watch+Personal villain+Action-Janssen is out of place-Story never takes the next step into greatness-Some unbelievable moments6.1/10",GoldenEye

47,CuriosityKilledShawn,I was never impressed,6,8 December 2012,"A lot people would claim that the Daniel Craig era Bond movies are the most hyped, especially Casino Royale and Skyfall, but back in November 1995, as a 15-year-old, I felt more hype and anticipation building around the release of GoldenEye. It was the first Bond movie in 6 years, the longest gap in the series, after audiences were turned off by the dark, angry License to Kill (still my favorite Bond movie). The old crew was gone, and a new star, M, Moneypenny, headquarters, and director were brought on board.While many of the people in the cinema that Saturday evening were thrilled by GoldenEye, I wasn't so smitten. After a summer of Die Hard 3, Waterworld, and Under Siege 2 the poor effects and model-work of this Bond movie failed to impress. But not only that, the script is also poor, the villain is weak, and there are grating contrivances. 17 years on, the mid-90s tech on show and exposition that a 5-year-old could now follow date the film badly.It begins in 1986 with 007 and 006 (an unconvincing Sean Bean, then 35, playing a 50-year-old for the most part) infiltrating a Russian base. Mr. Bean doesn't make it. Nine years later Bond is on leave, with a psychiatrist evaluating if he's still fit for the job. Meanwhile the Ruskie General he crossed years earlier is now in cahoots with Mr. Bean (you didn't really think they'd hire an actor of that caliber to be killed in the first scene did you?) and plans to rob the Bank of England and reset the balance with the help of a special satellite. You see 006 is actually a Cossack descended from blah...blah...blah. Yeah, that's the villain's motivation.The harsh, realistic tone of LTK is gone. The annoying fantasy of Moore-era 007 is back. Why the producers thought this was the way to go is beyond me. Thankfully, Tomorrow Never Dies was better. But GoldenEye is quite overrated and I can't find any justification for its popularity.",GoldenEye

What this one has going for it is a couple of fine looking Bond babes: Scorupco is the good girl while Janssen is the evil one.

50,The-Sarkologist,Trying to bring Bond into the 90s,5,3 March 2012,"This is the first James Bond movie starring Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. Brosnan is a little better than was Timothy Dalton (he plays a much better bad guy) but I don't think he can equal the excellence that were the original Bonds. They have returned to nasty Russians, but with the end of the Cold War it is not as good as it previously was. Bond is a character from the Cold War and he doesn't seem to work as well in the post Cold War era. In fact this idea is brought forth numerous times. In the Cold War such ideas that exist today cold have been suppressed by claiming them to be communist, but now it has changed. Without such an enemy we cannot suppress them anymore (though it still happens). The movie describes Bond as being a relic from the Cold War that holds onto attitudes that are no longer relevant. This theme runs through the movie but the fact is that he is still needed because the bad guys are still around; Russia is now open but it still has the army and the government that was dominant through the communist era.Bond's life has gone and he is not really needed anymore and this flaw is dragged out. Further things are emphasised with his Vodka Martini's shown to drown out the cries of those he has killed and the women that he embraces to throw away the betrayals that he has made. He is a man seeking forgiveness, yet this does not seem to come out of his character. The bad guy in this movie makes some awesome points about the character of James Bond but this is not drawn out in the character. If they were then the character of Bond would be far better. The flaws are also emphasized with Bond entering the 90's with the new M as a woman who is described as the evil queen of numbers.What pulls the movie down are a number of stupid things. The first stunt I just cannot believe. He leaps off a cliff after an airplane that is diving into a chasm, climbs aboard and pulls up just in time. It is supposed to be a spectacular stunt but seriously does not impress me. Also in this movie, Bond uses a lot of Machine Guns, which I feel that is inappropriate for his character. Then there is the tank chase through the streets of St. Petersburg and even more so with the marines hiding in Cuba. If US marines entered Cuba then there would be very big trouble. The movie tries to return from the old Bond but the old Bond is gone with the close of the Cold War and is now basically obsolete.",GoldenEye

52,slightlymad22,"A Mixed Bag, Brosnan Is Charming As Hell, But Plenty Of Flaws",6,24 March 2020,"GoldeneyeGoldeneye is not a perfect film, but it succeeds in updating 007 for a new millennium, it also retains all the classic elements of the series: it's exotic locations, glamorous wardrobes, women with suggested names and hi tech gadgetry. The chief asset of this film is clearly Pierce Brosnan, the best thing that could happen to him was not getting the part in 1986. He is a far more suitable as Bond in 1995. Brosnan has a very commanding screen presence and a unique ability to deliver witticism. If there is one criticism he doesn't bring anything new to the role he seems a mix of Connery and Moore. That said, he delivers the one liners well (even the bad ones like ""I'm a bit tied up at the moment"" urgghhh) is believable seducing the women, he looks great during the action scenes and is in fantastic shape. He brings back the ""I want to be that guy"" feeling of watching Bond.A big weak point for me is Sean Bean. Even back in 1995, I spotted his name is after Brosnan's in the credits (it's no surprise when he turns back up, though that scene is great) his characters motivation for treason is very shallow. The script (which had contribution from numerous writers) is often erratic, with individual scenes more engrossing than the main scheme, the musical score by Eric Senna is a bit muddled too. it's great at times, others (the race with Onatopp) are out of place. The Tina Turner title track is brilliant, I love it, but the song over the title track is one of the worst to feature in a Bond movie.It's clearly a movie of its time with how M (now brilliantly played by Dame Judy Dench) calls him a ""sexist, misogynist dinosaur - a relic of the Cold War"" and Moneypenny is a liberated woman of the 90's too. Refreshingly flying in the face of political correctness the character of Xenia Onatopp though. She harkens back to the glory days of Bond villainesses. Larger-than-life and played with enormous zeal by Famke Janssen. She stands out in every aspect. it's great to see Desmond Llewelyn, telling off his 5th Bond.Whilst we get to see Bond drive his Aston Martin DB5, disappointingly, his main Bond car is a BMW, Q talks him through all elaborate gadgets and then none of them are used. In fact, the BMW is barely used at all.And the fact that Bond (an agent who has saved the world countless times) was submitted to being evaluated by a junior bureaucrat is ridiculous.Goldeneye was a return to form at the box office for Bond, as it grossed $91 million at the domestic box office, to end the year as the 9th highest grossing movie of the year.",GoldenEye

55,zkonedog,A Little Bit Of Everything,9,8 March 2017,"When it comes to James Bond cinema, there is always a fine balance between ""camp"" and ""seriousness"". Too much goofy stuff (like the later years of the Roger Moore reign) and the films turn completely farcical. Too much seriousness (like ""Quantum of Solace"" and ""Skyfall"" under Daniel Craig) and the films lack that fun quality that a 007 picture so desperately needs. ""Goldeneye"" gets the balance just right, providing a film that is both engaging and fun at the same time.For a basic plot summary, ""Goldeneye"" introduces Pierce Brosnan as Bond, who is sent by the new female M (Judi Dench) into the former Soviet Union to foil a spy satellite plot set up by a nefarious Russian general (Gottfried John). Along the way, Bond meets ""good girl"" Natalya (Izabella Scorupco), ""bad girl"" Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and we are even introduced to a fellow MI6 agent in Alec (Sean Bean).One of the primary reasons that ""Goldeneye"" works so well is that it introduces a new Bond actor (in Brosnan) into the equation, and those movies (think ""Casino Royale"" and ""Live and Let Die"") tend me to just a notch above the rest as the intensity level is set a bit higher. I have to give director Martin Campbell a ton of credit here, as he knows how to create an intriguing-enough plot line around such an already established character.Of course, all the ""usual suspects"" (M's briefing, Q's weapons, the girls, etc.) are back in force, but nothing is too over-the-top or eye-rollingly bad. Again, that delicate balance between fun & engaging is achieved in spades.Finally, I would be remiss not to mention that the legacy of ""Goldeneye"" will (going forward) always be partially paved by the extraordinary success of the Nintendo '64 video game of the same name. This movie will always hold a special, nostalgic place in the hearts of 90s kids who played that epic game.Overall, ""Goldeneye"" is a tremendous Bond effort that has to (on any ranking) be very near if not the top of the list.",GoldenEye
56,johnnyboyz,"Smart and involving thriller which, aside from anything, revitalised the series.",7,30 April 2010,"I suppose hindsight tells us that ""Goldeneye"" bridges a kind of gap in history between Cold War era espionage and, what exactly, international terrorism? The likes of which hits you from out of nowhere - perpetrated by someone who used to be your ally, or at the very least behaved as if they were... If this is the case, you might say these components are epitomised by either of the film's villains - the suited Ourumov, who is titled; officious and still seems to dress like a Soviet despite the new epoch, and the other one, whose identity I will not reveal, but is mysterious; elusive and looks like he might be from anywhere. I always thought it interesting this particular character was introduced in a graveyard of Soviet relics, old and decrepit; pointing in no particular direction. They are the past and he is the future.With events both within and beyond the control of those responsible for ""Goldeneye"" conspiring against them, it is a miracle, in some ways, that the film was even made, never mind that it is as good as it is. The franchise had dabbled its toe in the water of moving away from what the James Bond brand is synonymous with in ""Licence to Kill"", a revenge piece about Latin American narcotic gangs, but, in spite of how good it was, audiences stayed away. Russia's relatively bloodless abandonment of its communist system in 1991, coinciding with then-Bond actor Timothy Dalton's, I think, reluctance to return to the role, placed the series in a no-man's-land. What did it do next? Nevertheless, everything worked out - this 1995 effort resembling something of some stature and an existential crisis of sorts averted.The film's pre-credits sequence, probably one of the best in the series, begins with an ambitious shot of a plane flying over a large dam, casting a slow shadow as it goes over, something which juxtaposes with the following sequence of a character bungee jumping off the top of it and so sailing down the face - the opposite directions of either body a physical representation of the two sides. The character is revealed to be Bond, played by Pierce Brosnan, whose reveal is playfully segmented: the penetrating eyes; the gloved hands; the back of the head; as a silhouette in a vent, etc.Therein infiltrating the dam, actually a chemical weapons facility, he meets, and is ambushed, a teasing foreshadower, by Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean), who is another MI6 agent with whom he is supposed to complete the mission. A point is made to depict Bond as seemingly reluctant to shoot guards if he does not need to, whereas Trevelyan seems all too happy to plug away, even at unarmed scientists if they are in the way, which again seems to foreshadow something. Eventually overwhelmed, Trevelyan is ambushed and seemingly killed, whereas Bond escapes with his life with probably one of the stunts of the series.It is to the credit of director Michael Campbell that the rest of the film matches this early high-bar. He unfolds ""Goldeneye"" at a tempo which is both about slow enough for an espionage thriller to work effectively and fast enough for a blockbuster to do so too, though it slips into the latter once or twice too often. When we move on to Monaco, we sense the film is feeling its way back into what it used to do with a series of scenes depicting sports cars; car chases; stunning localities; beautiful women; some gambling and one or two double-entendres, but we don't mind. The Monacan chapter is, in fact, in itself a strong segment whereby the unveiling of a state-of-the-art military helicopter looms in the background; we wonder what a certain Xenia Onatopp sees in a balding Canadian admiral twice her age and a fight sequence on board a yacht is impressively low-key.In the blizzard-swept Siberian town of Severnaya, an inconspicuous weapons outpost houses Boris, your more stereotypical 1990's hacker, and Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), as well as the eponymous Goldeneye weapon, which is stolen by the aforementioned Ourumov, for reasons tantalisingly yet unknown. Just prior, the film makes a point to depict Boris' cigarette lighter flame being extinguished by the force of the vessel Ourumov arrives in, inferring his place in the chain of command and foreshadowing the wipe-out which is about to be induced. Having seen what the weapon is capable of, there is a palpable sense of urgency when it falls into the hands of a later villain. Natalya, escaping said wipe-out, becomes a target of both those responsible and of those who want to know who's responsible.The film is kept on a steady rein for the rest of its duration, Brosnan managing to find a healthy place between the brutality which comes with the job and the funnier, more innuendo driven material. There are some really effective moments prior to the final act where Bond contemplatively looks out to sea from the confines of a beach and contemplates both of the past and the future. Simonova and Bond's relationship seems to intensify during these scenes; more than, perhaps, any other in previous entries, and I was impressed by the attention paid to Scorupco's character, who talks of how she's 'always wanted to see the Caribbean' - recall the postcards of tropical islands she had on her monitor back in Siberia, which gives her dimension.The narrative is much more interesting, I think, than Campbell realises, and it would be fair to say that there is too much second unit material where hundreds of bullets miss their mark. Suffering through the token 90's political correctness and the horrid BMW product-placement, a car barely used, is a price we have to pay for an entry which is actually difficult not to like.",GoldenEye
57,filipemanuelneto,A new life for Bond,6,2 April 2016,"Directed by Martin Campbell and produced by Barbara Broccoli (daughter of Albert Broccoli, who stepped down for health reasons), has screenplay by Jeffrey Caine and Bruce Feirstein, and is the seventeenth film in the franchise. It was produced after a long gap of six years, due to legal problems involving firms that had rights to the franchise. And it's very different from what was in the eighties, beginning with the cast: a veteran Judi Dench gave life to M, and for the first time the role was assigned to a woman; the role of Miss Moneypenny was awarded to Samantha Bond and 007 was assigned to Pierce Brosnan. From the list of previous films only survived Desmond Llewelyn, the eternal Q. In the film goes even Izabella Scorupco in the role of Bond-girl Natalya, Joe Don Baker in the role of Jack Wade, Robbie Coltrane in the role of Valentin Zukovsky, Alan Cumming in the role of Boris, Famke Janssen in the role of Xenia Gottfried John in the role of General Ourumov and Sean Bean in the role of villain Alec Trevelyan.In this film, James Bond seeks to combat Janus, a powerful criminal who stole a Russian mass destruction weapon, Goldeneye. To stop the villain that threatens to destroy London, he will ally Natalya, a Russian expert computer working on the Goldeneye project before it being stolen.This is the first Bond film to be released after the end of the Soviet Union, when the film industry had questioned the appropriateness of continuing the franchise. Despite the doubts, Pierce Brosnan took the role and the task of bringing his character to a new era of ""invisible enemies"" (using the words that M will say in ""Skyfall"", ten years later, when faced with precisely the same doubts). Although not one of the best films of the franchise, ""Goldeneye"" knew, in fact, update it. Brosnan is not surprising in his role but can be up to the challenge. Surprising is Judi Dench, in the role of M, achieving a remarkable performance. Its the first time that MI6 boss assumes a major role in the plot, and shows even little appreciation for Bond, considering him a relic of the past and something to be discarded, as to seem a form of play with the criticisms made to the franchise before the film's release. The chosen locations are excellent and some of the film's scenes are worthy of memory. This is the case of the tank sequence in St. Peterburg's streets, or the final fight in the antenna. The script is also well thought out, despite having decided to completely ignore the novels of Ian Flemming. The story revolves around the end of the USSR and the ""remains"" that were all this past: we do not speak only of weaponry but also of people, as Bond and Alec, were marked by decades of cold war. The theft of Russian weapons may be the introduction of the new Bond world of terrorism? Perhaps. The opening theme of this film, sung by Tina Turner and consists of Bono, in my opinion, one of the best of the entire franchise.",GoldenEye
58,leplatypus,Golden Touch (screen) (vhs) (dvd),10,25 August 2011,"I am not a Bond fan: see my 400+ reviews, in six years, i saw only one Bond movie (""Quantum"") and it was the choice of the kids. Bond isn't my favorite because i laugh at the villain and it's always the same recipe: the girls and the high-life, all the more than it's contradictory to have Bond in casinos because the terrorists don't hide there.But i make an exception for this one because at least, the reason to have spies is put in the plot: politics.I think it was a great choice to have Bond finally tackle soviets and the time of ending the cold war. Next, the movie has the best villain of all franchise: Famke is a vicious soldier who literally eats the screen. From Monaco to Saint Petersburg to Cuba, it has the best locations and newcomer Brosnan is the perfect pick for the job.

62,Anonymous_Maxine,"Yeah, Pierce!!",9,9 August 2001,"With the excellent performance that Pierce Brosnan puts into this excellent, excellent Bond film, it comes as a shock that he followed it up with two consecutive 007 crapfests. GoldenEye starts off with one of the best opening sequences of the entire Bond series. Who cares that the plane that he skydived after was way beyond saving, or that there was no possible way that he could have held himself at the bottom of that bungee cord? This impossibility is standard with James Bond, and in my opinion, it always makes the movies impossible to take seriously at all, but there was something about all of GoldenEye that made it more fun than usual and also much better than many of the other Bond films. The opening theme song is just awful (as usual), but it's probably one of the best bad ones of the series (I'm not sure if the excellent theme song for The World Is Not Enough will ever be surpassed, by the way).GoldenEye also has some great action, particularly the chases. We almost immediately get a great car chase on mountain roads, although every red-blooded male (the film's target audience) who sees this film will groan in almost physical pain when he sees how they mistreated a Ferrari Testarossa in that chase. I almost couldn't watch. And then later there is a spectacular chase through the streets in which Bond pilots a TANK! HELL yeah. This chase, by the way, was just awesome, although there was a dubious portion of it in which Bond drives the tank through some sort of parking garage beneath a building, literally tearing out the first floor, and not only does the poor building not collapse, but he is followed by a squadron of jeeps that are magically able to climb right over all of the huge chunks of fallen concrete left by the destruction of the tank. And I won't even mention the way that this chase was almost rendered completely ineffective by the way completely moronic things were thrown in, like this tank's unique ability to spin its tracks like a race car. Have you ever seen the skid marks left by a tank as it accelerates too fast for the tracks to grip the road? You haven't? You know why, right?Oh yeah, the GoldenEye. That's some weapon located on an orbiting satellite that is able to shoot a laser to the surface of the earth and disable every electronic device within a radius of like, 30 miles or something. So there's the traditional super villain threat (evidently operated by the Russians), now back to the interesting stuff.  Judi Dench gives the Bond series probably more of a boost than Brosnan's excellent performance as the latest Bond (at least in comparison to the sorry performances from Timothy Dalton and Roger Moore). She is the new M, and her scene in which she calls Bond a `sexist misogynist dinosaur' is some of the best stuff ever uttered in a Bond film. Q's traditional scene where he introduces all of Bond's newest gadgets has made a tremendous leap from License To Kill, even though the vast majority of those gadgets were hardly, if ever, used in the film, and that includes the BMW (which effectively turned this and the next two Bond films into two-hour BMW commercials).(spoilers) And how about those villains? Not only do we get to actually meet another double-O, but it turns out that he becomes the main villain in this installment in the 007 series. His reasons for rebelling against her majesty's secret service were not exactly very creative, though. They should have just had him say, `Who ever heard of 006?!' That would have been funnier AND better. And then there was the laughable female villain, Xenia Onatopp (nyuk nyuk), who is into some seriously rough sex and also seems to have orgasmic episodes when cutting dozens of people in half with a machine gun. Oh yeah, she likes to get people into scissor locks and squeeze them to death after sex, although I didn't even have any sympathy when she did that to Bond, because in my opinion, even the most rib-shattering scissor lock is nothing that a good punch in the head couldn't solve right quick. She did have a pretty good death scene, though, followed by Bond's usual one-liner (`She always did enjoy a good squeeze'). Speaking of one-liners, they went a little overboard with them in GoldenEye, even more than usual. Even the villains had these goofy one-liners, and I still can't figure out why they keep putting them in these movies, because maybe every fifteenth one is anything but ridiculous.And, of course, how could I leave out the usual easily escapable near death-scenes for our hero 007? The scene where he is tied and unconscious in a helicopter in which the missiles are programmed to fire and then return to blow it up was actually a pretty good scene, but the intelligence of the villains is effectively illustrated by the fact that they didn't bother to disable the ejection seat. If they were REALLY smart, they would have disabled the parachutes and then purposely tied Bond so that he could just reach the ejection button. Evidently those boneheads don't realize that that would be an almost funny way to kill Bond. At any rate, even though the villains were a little overly obnoxious and unintelligent in this installment, the movie comes off way above average for a 007 film. The ending is excellent (despite the ridiculous notion that 006 could have survived a fall like that), and that gigantic underwater satellite was a cool idea, too. The Bond girl is definitely one of the most beautiful of the entire series, and there is even a hint of meaningful direction (which is unheard of in a Bond film), after the plane crash. Despite many of the usual weaknesses, GoldenEye is definitely one of the top Bond films.",GoldenEye
63,jzappa,Bond's Beautiful Return For A New Generation,8,6 February 2007,"In 1995, I was seven years old and had no idea who James Bond really was. My dad, my older brother, and his girlfriend all suddenly swept me up one day, taking me to see Goldeneye. I was dazzled. As a seven-year-old boy who was already into superheroes and action figures at the time, you can imagine how a good, large-scale James Bond movie would sweep me off my feet. This is one person's perspective of James Bond's return to the next generation after a six-year absence. I'm now eighteen years old and revisiting the Bond films, and though I bought it on VHS the first day it was available over a decade ago and watching it so many times, GoldenEye could be considered the gateway to the modern action movie. It's definitely one of the best of the best in the Bond series, and the high-tech thrillers of the following years could be considered its spawning.Pierce Brosnan is the side of James Bond that my age group knows best, and though he brings a sort of laid back arrogance to the character, he is among the best to have ever played Bond. What's interesting about Pierce Brosnan's version, especially after watching those of the other actors whose careers have been blessed with the curse of being one of the many faces James Bond, is that he brings an almost surreal cockiness and emotional invincibility to the hero. No matter what happens to him in this film, no matter how cataclysmal a human or objectified nemesis may be, he never breaks the facial expression he wears, which is that of a person who has just had a wonderful massage. He is completely assured of himself to the point where he knows as sure as he's born that he could never even trip and fall, for that would make him imperfect, the thought of which he would laugh at. We are surely so used to this brand of action hero now that it's a surprise after watching Connery's cold yet quietly intense suavity or Dalton's aggressive, vindictive boldness.Whether you are one of the many that enjoy the fantasy of such a character or one of the many that can hardly stand such delusion in an important means of artistic communication like film, or someone who's torn between both views, GoldenEye's plot is genuinely exciting, as if the 007 franchise had a battery that needed to be recharged. Even though Dalton's two Bond films were an improvement over the slump that Roger Moore's overlong stint put the series through, they ran on atmosphere and dark romantic undertones rather than good plot or substantial wit. GoldenEye is a refreshment, the best Bond film for years.It's ending is purely a formulaic wrap-up just as most 007 endings are, and the action sequences run beyond the normal lack of practicality or realism, the tank chase having a few points of hilarity because of this, but the Bond women of the new age are very strong characters as opposed to the helpless bimbos of the series' chauvinistic history, and the opening title sequence and theme song are tremendously impressive. The film is directed extremely well and there are no bad actresses in this one.",GoldenEye
64,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,3 November 2020,"Well, it was nice to see Bond back on the screen, and just in time for me to get my Drivers License, so this isn't the 1st 007 film I ever saw on the big screen, but it's the first that I got to drive myself to.And I remember that the media kept asking ""who will be 007's villain now that the USSR has fallen?"" By then I had seen all the Bond films to date, by then I was a 007 fanatic, and that is when I first realized that the media really has the memory of a Goldfish... a lesson that would serve me well later in life and still does to this day.Anyway, it was pretty classy fun how you only got glimpses of Brosnan for the first few moments of the introduction... it WOULD have been better if, you know, the entire world didn't know he was 007 already, but I guess it was a happy surprise for the few people that were living under a rock for the year or so leading up to the film's release. The few people that missed all of the nonstop hype.Tina Turner did one of the better 007 songs, Brosnan had a heck of a showing as 007... Onatop was probably the last of the 007 suggestive name tropes to make an appearance in film (unless you count Christmas who was only named so for a closing joke), and for the most part it was a great showing.I mean, the tank chase alone should sell you on it. As should 006.But, at the end, it was just a competent and decent showing that is beloved primarily because of relief. Relief that Brosnan was 007, relief that they were making 007 movies again, relief that some fun was brought back to the world.",GoldenEye
65,ebiros2,Good production but ....,5,25 April 2011,"James Bond movies have jumped the shark several times before coming to this point, and this is just a pat James Bond formula done with people going through the formalities of making a movie look like a James Bond movie.The usual Bond and Q's quibble over the new gadget, the utterly characterless antagonists (except Xenia was an interesting character but bit over the edge), Bond's over involvement with the chic, and a story that has no focus all marks the woe of newer Bond movies. You can tell that the movie is lavishly produced, and no efforts are spared, but if that's not enough to make an exceptional movie, then this movie is the prime example. Characters are weak (again except Xenia), and that's what annoying about the entire movie. Since there's at least one actress who's carrying her presence through the movie, I'd have to put the blame squarely on the cast. We have a series of B list actors in position where you need better actors and supporting characters in the role. Even Brosnan just mumbles his way through the entire movie.Stronger cast would have made a better movie, and better directing would have made a difference.

67,dee.reid,"Bond is back in his greatest outing during the '90s, ""GoldenEye""",10,22 May 2009,"After a six-year hiatus, Ian Fleming's James Bond returned to the big screen in a big way in ""GoldenEye."" When it was released in 1995, the Cold War was over, so a new enemy was needed to rise from the ashes of the conflict. And a new James Bond was needed, since ""License to Kill"" in 1989 was both a critical and commercial disappointment. The man chosen to fill the shoes of James Bond this time out was Welshman Pierce Brosnan, who is my personal favorite Bond. This time out, Agent 007 squares off against his former ally Agent 006 Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean), now a terrorist-for-hire after being believed killed on their last mission in the former Soviet Union. Trevelyan's plan involves the theft of the top-secret Russian military satellite GoldenEye, and with it he's going execute his own personal vengeance against Bond and MI6. Bond girls here include sexy-but-deadly Xenia Zirgavna Onatopp (Famke Janssen), the Russian helicopter pilot who can literally crush a man to death with her legs, and the sexy-but-sexy Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), the Russian computer programmer who survives the initial theft of the GoldenEye satellite. Martin Campbell directs this picture. Brosnan was always my personal favorite Bond character, after the departure Timothy Dalton. He's more vulnerable and human than past Bonds, but he's still the hip, suave, and witty British secret service agent with a license to kill and a penchant for bedding beautiful women. As a ""Bond"" picture, it has everything a ""James Bond"" movie should have: a globe-spanning odyssey through exotic locales, over-the-top villains, spectacular action sequences (including a tank chase through the streets of St. Petersburg, Russia) and beautiful women. ""GoldenEye"" was a marvelous return for a series that some thought had gone the way of the Cold War and into the annals of history. Thankfully, the changed political environment of the post-Cold War era of the 1990s proved that James Bond still has what it takes to save the world, and not just be the prototypical Commie-killer of years past.10/10",GoldenEye

69,drqshadow-reviews,"Bond is Rejuvenated with a Fresh Sense of Rich, Playful Vigor",8,28 January 2020,"Pierce Brosnan's debut behind the martini glass is easily the best Bond movie since Sean Connery first quit the role, nearly thirty years prior. Everything just seems to click for Brosnan, who deftly balances the tricky contrast between suave, romantic espionage and blunt, campy excess while still, somehow, seeming cool and in-command. He's familiar but replenished, a character we've grown to appreciate over the course of sixteen preceding films, cast in a new light. No growing pains whatsoever - this agent hits the ground running.The plot's emphasis on post-Soviet decay provides a long-sought modern backdrop to the series (at the time of its release, at least), while opening the door for all sorts of fresh concepts, unique characters and fascinating set pieces. Bond's fleeting showdown with an ex-comrade (Sean Bean, in a fantastic villainous turn) amid a cluster of stylish, discarded Russian monuments is a particular standout in that respect.It's not perfect, by any means - the tech bits are laughable, the timeline's a mess, it's overly long - but it's undeniably fun to watch, colorful and edgy and hip, and a decided return to form for a series that had been floating, directionless, for quite a while.

Rankings are subjective, but what I will say about Brosnan is that he blends many of the best traits of the Bond actors before him. He's lighter than Dalton, but never as campy as Moore at his worst. He straddles the line rather deftly here, and the result is a Bond that is capable but w/a twinkle and bounce the razor sharp Dalton--who I love--never quite pulled off.The story is reasonably strong, w/a villain who has personal motivations beyond ""ruling the world"" and it acts as the sinew for a couple of fun action scenes.Overall 'GoldenEye' is a very strong outing, bringing together the best of what people have always loved about the character and the series.",GoldenEye

The plot of bond movies are majorly similar and this movie also has little exception regarding the plot. The execution is great and will keep you engaged to the movie.Screenplay of the movie is fast paced and keeps you glued to the screen. Direction of the movie is good. Acting is great and Brosnan looks fantastic in the portray of Bond.

Good start, certainly better than average.Coming into watching this film series for the first time, Brosnan is the only lead actor that I'm more than familiar with - so therefore I am expecting top things from his stint. 'GoldenEye' is a solid start.007 has seen more entertaining plots, but this one makes for fun enough viewing.

75,barnabyrudge,"The return of James Bond after a six-year hiatus - not vintage Bond, but good fun.",6,22 March 2006,"The James Bond franchise, in cinematic terms, began in 1962 with Dr No. There followed a Bond movie every couple of years or so (the longest gap between two 007 films was the three-year-hiatus separating The Man With The Golden Gun - 1974 - and The Spy Who Loved Me - 1977). Then, in 1989, with the release of Licence To Kill the series seemed to die. The box office returns of that film were disappointing; the then-Bond actor Timothy Dalton was axed; the film itself was presented in a grittier, more adult style than fans were accustomed to; and various legal wranglings put the Bond character into limbo. Six long years went by without a Bond movie and many insiders predicted an end for the British super-spy and his outrageous screen adventures. Too much time had gone by, they said, no-one was interested any longer in the character or the stories. But then Goldeneye came along, with Pierce Brosnan as Bond - it went on to become a commercial hit, propelling its star into the A-list and reinvigorating the entire series.James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) and his secret agent colleague Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean) infiltrate a Russian military installation on a sabotage mission. During the mission, Alec is apparently killed by the enemy forces but Bond manages a miraculous escape. Several years later, a state-of-the-art helicopter is stolen from the West by some Russian spies and used to destroy a Siberian satellite station. When Bond investigates, he discovers to his surprise that the plot involves his old colleague Alec - who is very much alive, having faked his death in the earlier exchange. Trevelyan's plan is to get control of a powerful satellite called the Goldeneye and to use it to destroy a designated target on Earth - in this case, London. It emerges that his parents were Liensk Cossacks, brutally killed by the British when he was a boy, and he has long plotted a way to have his revenge. Bond teams up with a Russian computer programmer, Natalya Semyonova (Isabella Scorupco) and pursues Trevelyan around the globe in an effort to stop his sinister scheme. The trail leads to Cuba, where Trevelyan has a secret lair from which he is on the very brink of unleashing chaos upon the world.... unless 007 can find a way to thwart him.Goldeneye begins with a truly outrageous stunt involving Bond freefalling in pursuit of an unpiloted, plummeting airplane. This dumb but enjoyable scene sets the tone for the rest of the film - very much a tongue-in-cheek, improbable, action-orientated romp. Brosnan is OK as Bond, though I still feel Sean Connery and Roger Moore were slightly better suited to the role. Tina Turner's powerful theme song is very good, but the incidental scoring by Eric Serra has a tinny, tacky feel to it that makes one long for John Barry! As the bad guy, Sean Bean is effective enough even if he never quite matches the memorableness of the all-time great Bond villains (eg Dr No, Oddjob, Blofeld, Francisco Scaramanga). The Bond girls are very good in this one - Scorupco plays a pleasingly resourceful character, while Famke Janssen has great fun as a female baddie who crushes victims between her thighs. Goldeneye is by no means the best of the Bond series, but one has to be thankful to it for getting the dormant series up and running once more. And, in its pacy, breakneck way, it is undeniably a lot of fun.",GoldenEye
76,NateWatchesCoolMovies,One of the best Bond films,8,11 May 2016,"GoldenEye is the very finest hour that Pierce Brosnan had as James Bond, both as a film and in terms of what he gets to do as the character. It's my third favourite Bond film of all time and stands as one of the most exciting ventures the series has seen to this day. It definitely falls into a campy style, but one that's removed from that of the original Bond films from way back when, one that's all its own and decidedly 90's. It's also got one of the strongest and classiest villains of the series, a man who is in fact an ex agent himself which was a neat switch up. Brosnan is so photogenic it's ridiculous, whether dolled up in the tux or careening through a valley in a fighter jet. He just looks so damn good as Bond, and I sometimes wish he'd gotten a fifth crack at the character. Here we join up with 007 on a mission gone wrong, where he is ambushed and his partner Agent Alec Trevelyan a.k.a. 006 (Sean Bean) is killed, or so he thinks. 006 is in fact alive and well, with a few gnarly facial scars and a new nasty attitude. He puts Bond through a wringer with a diabolical scheme to hijack a Russian nuclear space weapon and do all kinds of lovely things with it. Bond teams up with the survivor of a decimated Russian research centre, a beautiful scientist named Natalya (Isabella Scorupco) who inevitably ends up in his bed. It's slick, it's stylish, it's sexy and everything a Bond flick needs to be. 006 has a dangerous asset in Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), a lethal assassin whose weapon of choice are her thighs which she employs with the crushing power of two Amazonian pythons. Janssen plays the role with ferocious relish and the kind of enthusiasm that hadn't been seen in a Bond villainess since Barbara Carrera in Never Say Never Again. Bean plays it ice cold, letting restraint and calculated malice steal the scenes as opposed to flagrant mustache twirling. I always thought he would have made a cracking good 007 as he has so much residual danger to his vibe from playing many heartless bastards in his career, but perhaps in another life. One of my favourite characters to ever hang out in a Bond flick shows up here, a cranky but lovable Russian general named Valentin Zukofsky, played by the awesome Robbie Coltrane, an actor who really, really needs to be in more stuff. His few short scenes are the stuff that makes a piece timeless, and I wish we'd gotten to see more Valentin and more Hagrid elsewhere in the franchise. There's the usual suspects like Judi Dench as M and Desmond Llewellyn as a crusty Q, and a host of other actors including Joe Don Baker, Tchecky Karyo, Minnie Driver and the irritating Alan Cumming who singlehandedly ruins scenes with his hammy preening. The film thunders along with furious energy and nicely paced action sequences, including a chaotic tank chase through the streets of Moscow and a stunner of a climax set atop a giant satellite dish. As Bond films go, you can never go wrong with this one.",GoldenEye
77,Kdosda_Hegen,Alright action flick.,5,28 December 2020,"This film doesn't shine much. It's heavily sexual and most of the action choreography is poor. The only great action scene is the one with the tank, that scene is truly awesome, but for the most part it's a forgettable action film.",GoldenEye
78,slokes,"Swell Looking Bond, Wrong Feel",5,15 December 2009,"Pierce Brosnan was the best looking and least likable of the six actors to play 007 for the Eon production team. No film demonstrates this better than this, his first.It's a new decade for James Bond. Now he works for a woman, has to be evaluated for mental fitness, and with the fall of the Soviet Union must rely on the friendship of old enemies not to mention the enmity of old friends. All this comes into play when he is sent to discover the reason for an explosion at a Russian satellite monitoring station.When ""GoldenEye"" came out, more than six years had passed since the last Bond movie. Many wondered if time had passed James by. The movie plays this up when Bond is called a ""sexist, misogynistic dinosaur"" by his new M (Judi Dench). Bond seems unfazed by this, and everything else.""Trick is to quit while you're still ahead,"" says his most charming adversary in this adventure, Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen).""That's one trick I've never learned,"" Bond replies.Brosnan looks fantastic in the action sequences, better than any Bond before him, and his James Coburn-like grin rivals Connery's smirk and Moore's raised eyebrow for a facial signature. Too bad his overall smugness gets in the way. Here's one Bond you actually root against, especially when pitted against Onatopp. Employing missionary zeal if not position in her quest for the perfect kill, Onatopp is one of Bond's most memorable adversaries, and a riot as played by the brave Janssen.Also helping matters a lot is the film's other Bond girl, Izabella Scorupco, and a nifty title song from Tina Turner written by Bono and The Edge that captures the spirit if not the sound of 1960s Bond movies. Q (Desmond Llewelyn) gets off some good lines.What loses me about this movie most is the second half, where a once-taut and plausible story (well, except for Bond jumping off a cliff and into an airplane) gives way to a lot of nonsense where Bond drives a tank through St. Petersburg and outraces a speeding train. Crazy visuals are one thing, but Bond kills more Russians in this movie than he did in the whole series up to this point, and many of them are innocent patriots who merely get in his way. So much for the end of the Cold War!Director Martin Campbell, who would go on to unretire Bond more effectively a second time in the later ""Casino Royale"", fashions a clean visual look that gives the action sequences added oomph. There's some wheat among the chaff in terms of dialogue, though the writers overdo the humor probably trying to compensate for the previous Bond, Timothy Dalton, whose sober mien was (unfairly) criticized by many. Let's just say that our first image of Brosnan as Bond shouldn't be of him hanging upside down in a toilet stall, but it is.The Brosnan of ""GoldenEye"" presents us with a good actor and an electric screen presence, but he lacks the occasional deferential quality other Bond actors had; the ability to look at his situation with an encouraging shrug or wink that allowed you to feel some kind of bond with him. Brosnan's about coolness and distance, which detract somewhat from the generally decent ""GoldenEye"", and would become more of a problem in time.",GoldenEye
79,questl-18592,"Brosnan, James Brosnan",8,24 December 2020,"This movie fully deserves it's status as a classic in the action/thriller/spy/drama category. It's so much fun, well written, solid dialogue and yet it finds that sweet spot with just the right amount of classic Bond ridiculousness. Famke Jensenn playing Onatopp, a soviet assassin who kills men by riding them to death in bed? Yup, sounds like a Bond movie. Judi Dench absolutely kills it as M, I love the gravitas and complexity she brings to the role. Even back in 1995 calling out Bond, what some would consider to be the fictional epitome of toxic masculinity and chauvinism, and saying he's a dinosaur and that she has no problem sending him off to die if she has to. Love her so much in this. As for Bond himself, this may be because I grew up in this period but I have always loved Brosnan in the role. Yes, the later films get exponentially more absurd and the quality absolutely goes down but he is so perfectly cast as the suave, charming and devilish-at-times international man of mystery. That man wears the hell out of those suits, drinks a martini with the best of them and looks just right in that Aston Martin.Definite recommend for people interested in a solid action flick. The plot is a little crazy, but that was perfectly in line with when it was made and the style of film it's going for. Easily worth a rent.",GoldenEye
80,davidmvining,Brosnan kicks off his tenure as Bond in great style,10,2 March 2020,"There's a seeming effortlessness to the action scenes here, lent from the fluid camera work and excellent choreography, that I don't think I've seen from a Bond film. Yes, there have been great stunts for a long time, but the action filmmaking here feels just so much more graceful, in a way. At the same time, this is the first film that embraces a grungier aesthetic, using dirt and dust in great amount to create a great visual texture. There's a great antagonist, and a new Bond in Pierce Brosnan who fits so easily into the role in his first outing.I didn't think the franchise needed a major retooling after the Dalton years. Things were actually going pretty well, but with Dalton gone and the end of the USSR there had to be some kind of changeup. What's fun about how the movie, led by Brosnan and director Martin Campbell bring everything around Bond into the 90s, but they knowingly keep Bond exactly as he was (to a degree). The new M, played coldly well by Judi Dench, calls him a sexist, misogynistic pig, and Bond doesn't bat an eye. He doesn't change, he's still going to sleep with any attractive woman that he can. The USSR is gone, but Bond still finds those who look like Soviets to fight. When he meets Jack Wade, the CIA operative in St. Petersburg, Bond demands the old Cold War way of identifying fellow operatives through code phrases. The world may have changed with a greater look at sexual politics and the ""end of history"", but Bond is going to keep being Bond.So, the movie begins with what might be the best pre-credits opening sequence in the franchise. The bungie jump down the side of the dam, the break in, the capture, the killing of Alec Trevelyan, the explosions, Bond's tense escape followed by his exciting escape. It's all just so exciting, cleanly filmed, and easy to understand as it unfolds. The stunts that fit in it are thrilling on their own as well.Skipping ahead nine years, Bond is still very much Bond, having fun with women and cars. His entry into the plot of the movie is really based almost purely on the coincidence of driving along the same road as Xenia Onatopp and then happening to meet her in a casino later that night. Whether it's through lust or simple gut instinct, he follows her just enough to figure out her underworld ties and watch her steal a prototype helicopter that can survive an EMP blast.The movie approaches the mystery of Xenia's and General Ourumov really well. When Xenia steals the helicopter, we barely notice the other person with her (who is not Ourumov). When the pair show up at Severnaya in Siberia, the center for testing and operation of the Goldeneye EMP weapon, and steal it, blowing up the facility in the process. What are their plans at this point? We're not sure. In fact, we don't even know who's actually in charge.We only find out later after Bond goes to St. Petersburg and gets a meeting set up with Janus, the mysterious figure behind all the actions so far, and it turns out to be Trevelyan, 006 from nine years before. There's a bit of a data dump about the Lienz Cossacks, their treatment by the British government after World War II, and how Alec is the son of some Cossacks. I've read that Alec was originally supposed to be played by an older actor like Anthony Hopkins, making him a former Cossack himself. I think that would have made the character's motives make a bit more sense and made it more immediate, but the late dump of information may actually be my problem with sorting out his motives. Outside of that, though, Trevelyan is a great villain. His plan is expansive, and intricate. He ends up using his motives as an excuse to steal all the money in the financial markets of London before blowing the country to the Stone Age with Goldeneye.Through it all, Bond deals with two women, Xenia and her thighs of death, and Natalya Simonova, a programmer who worked on Goldeneye. Xenia reminds me of Christopher Walken's character in A View to a Kill. They're both thin psychopaths, but Xenia is a supporting antagonist while Walken was the main antagonist. Xenia works a lot better because of that supporting nature. The entire plot doesn't hinge on her motives. Natalya is a modern Bond girl to a point. She challenges Bond's violent tendencies (calling him a boy with toys), but ends up falling for him anyway. You see, Bond, the dinosaur, still gets things done in the 90s, and he doesn't sacrifice his way of doing things in the process. A gun and a smooch is all he needs (and a few gadgets here and there).This is the reboot Bond didn't need, but it delivered so incredibly well. Brosnan makes his appearance as Bond in the best first outing of a Bond, ever. The action is dynamic and exciting. The mystery around the plot and villain works really well. The supporting cast is great including Alan Cumming as Boris, the computer programmer who gives Trevelyan all the technical support he needs. They work great in contrast with each other, by the way. Alec is physical and lowkey. Boris is mental and loudly boastful, and when we finally see them together in a scene, Alec shuts him down with just a look.The film embraces the nature of Bond while providing Brosnan enough space for him to make his mark. It's the best Bond film since Goldfinger.",GoldenEye
81,Kamurai25,YellowEye: Pass the saline,6,9 July 2020,"Boring watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend unless you're just a Bond fan.I remember liking this movie, I loved the video game, and even had some nostalgia in the first action scene as I watch people tumble about as realistically as N64 ragdoll physics, but I was honestly yawning and just wondering why I actually wanted to watch this again.It's not that Sean Bean and Pierce Brosnon don't make for good Bond's, it's that Bond is a poor character archetype: it's the same reason as why Superman is boring, he is the solution, his presence reduces accomplishment. It's not impressive to be perfect because you aren't trying.This is the mentally that some people actually aspire too, they want to watch this and pretend to be some effortless persona, and those are the people that would enjoy this, it's just not me.The one thing I like from this movie (and it's not even the computer nerd), is (my favorite role of) Famke Janssen where she is embodying a complete and true psychopath. Onatopp was clearly a cheap attempt at a ""venus flytrap"", but there is a deeper femme fatale character there. Give me a movie about her killing her way through Europe, or put her in a Black Widow movie.",GoldenEye

84,brando647,Pierce Brosnan's Best (and First) Run as 007...,8,30 November 2008,"For me, this was the film that started it all. It was my first exposure to the James Bond films and the one that spurred me to see all the rest. This film is Pierce Brosnan's first portrayal of the iconic character and, when I first saw the film, I was blown away. Since then, it seems to have lost some of its magic but I still rank it as one of my favorite Bond films. In this installment, 007 must track down a stolen satellite that has the ability to release an EMP and cripple a nation; the trail leads him to a criminal organization known as Janus, run by a spectre from Bond's past. The film is directed by Martin Campbell (who also directed the more recent ""Casino Royale"") and would become Brosnan's best outing in the role.In my opinion, this was the last Bond film to utilize all of the normal 007 film elements without going over-the-top. Bond continues with the one-liners and innuendo but it's never groan-inducing (though some of the supporting cast do have a couple lame ones...I'm lookin' at you, Xenia...). The action has the usual outlandish stunts, including an awesome chase through the streets of St. Petersburg, Russia with Bond driving a tank...still one of the best 007 chase scenes. Brosnan does a great job of taking of the character, bringing the usual suaveness with realistic tones that never cross over into camp.This film also boasts one of the hottest (and most talented) Bond girls from the series, Izabella Scorupco as computer programmer Natalya Simonova. She's got beauty and brains, adding a nice counter to Brosnan's Bond. Sean Bean's been an actor I've respected in everything I've seen him in, and he plays a perfect antagonist in the role of a former MI6 agent...the guy's talented and would've made a great 007 himself. Throw in the gorgeous Famke Janssen and Judi Dench's debut as M and you've got a great cast. Really, there isn't a lot to complain about with this film. At points, it may drag a bit but it's a well-rounded film that does it's job...it entertains.",GoldenEye
85,Gislef,Psycho-Bond,4,14 January 1999,"Psych 101!  Sean Bean's Alex is hugely over-analyzed and comes with (mildly contradictory) motives to spare.  Geez, did we need to know in this kind of detail (for instance) _why_ Goldfinger lusts after gold, or why Kananga and Sanchez are trying to make money through drugs, or why Scaramanga likes killing people?  But everybody gets into the psychoanalysis garbage in this one:  Alex and Bond exchange witty psychoanalytic bon mots (ooh), Natalya decides to take her own look at Bond's psyche - sheesh, if this is Bond for the 90's spare us.  As for Xenia and the rudimentary ""violence=sex"" psych motive, ehh.  They do remember to throw in an impressive action sequence occasionally, though, and there's a plot of sorts.  Another lacking element is the locale:  sorry, but Siberia, St. Petersburg and outdoor Cuba (I forget - why does Alex have a secret base in Cuba?!?) are not the exotic locales of a Tokyo, or San Monique, or Bangkok, or even Kentucky.  As for Pierce Brosnan, he tries his best but saddled with the psychology script from hell, he seems to be confused exactly what he's supposed to be doing on those couches.  There are some nice performances all around, really (except for Joe Don Baker - great, his character from the movie Mitchell becomes a CIA agent *sigh*).  Overall, though, it adds up to a below-average entry into the series.",GoldenEye
86,Luigi Di Pilla,EXPLOSIVE,8,8 March 2003,"As every James Bond movie this one is another example of a masterpiece of action, suspense and thrills. Congratulations to director Martin Campbell and of course to all the actors and stuff. I liked very much the performance of the bad girl, bad boy Sean Bean and Pierce Brosnan as the agent 007. Very nice pictures and once more MGM created a top action thriller. If you liked this don´t miss the other James Bond in TOMORROW NEVER DIES or THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH. I highly recommend also VERTICAL LIMIT from the same director. 8/10.",GoldenEye
87,mjw2305,Brilliant,9,20 January 2007,"Since Connery gave up his licence to kill, we've seen Roger Moore's tongue-in-cheek portrayal, that wasn't without it's charm, but always seemed a little more humorous than in previous outings. Timothy Dalton brought a serious and gritty take on the character, which reflected Ian Fleming's original vision very well, but he still lacked the charisma of Connery's Bond.In Goldeneye, we see Pierce Brosnan take on the role of our favourite spy, and being the gifted actor that his is, he re-captures a lot of what made Connery so special, while imposing himself on the character of Bond really well. The movie itself it simply brilliant, it has a fine plot (one of the best in the series) and its packed with great action and stunts that are believable and very impressive. The introduction of Judi Dench as 'M' was also a inspired move, she slips into the role effortlessly. Everything in this thrilling instalment adds up in the tradition of the genre, definitely one of the best Bond movies.9/10",GoldenEye
88,Howlin Wolf,The one to watch if you weren't impressed with the previous 007 outings...,7,9 April 2001,"They had something like a 6 year gap between making ""Licence to Kill"" and this, and it shows - in a positive way. This is Bond modernised, serious, as he should be, but not without the odd moment of levity to lighten the mood. Perhaps the reason I disliked Bond before I came to this was that by the time I'd gotten old enough to properly appreciate the series it had disappeared. ""The Living Daylights"" was the first Bond film I saw that I thought was halfway decent and I haven't seen ""Licence to Kill"" to this day.I really liked Dalton as Bond, and can't understand all the flak he received. Perhaps it was because he had the temerity to try and 'act' the role after the shameless mugging of Roger Moore and his eyebrows. This was Bond as Ian Fleming supposedly WANTED him played, why was everybody complaining? I have to say that in my opinion all those people who would rank Moore above Dalton are nothing more than philistines...So; ""Goldeneye"" gets rid of the bad taste that Moore's 80's outings left in the mouth without making things so dark as to turn audiences away. I have never seen a Connery Bond film (I know: shameful) but in all the short clips and photographs I've seen he looks like he makes the definitive James Bond. Brosnan must surely tie with Dalton though; not QUITE as good an actor but definitely looks the part. Ironically, this is the film in which he looks most comfortable in the role, despite it being his first installment. Perhaps it's because the script is the best of the 3, despite ""TND"" being marginally the more entertaining film.The rest of the cast all fit perfectly into their roles as well. Sean Bean makes the best Bond villain in ages, rivaled only by Sophie Marceau's Elektra King in ""T.W.I.N.E"". The whole 'vengeance' plot isn't the most originally conceptualised or written, but Brosnan and Bean perform it with gusto. Isabella Scorupco is unremarkable as Natalya (apart from the fact that she's given a bit to do - shock!) while Robbie Coltrane and Alan Cumming are both superb in two very different comic tinged roles.I saved Famke Janssen till last for us guys. She pulls off gorgeous and evil effortlessly. I do believe (although I haven't seen it in awhile) that as Bond brings her to justice he quips ""What a waste!"". I for one would heartily echo that sentiment. Also look out for a Minnie Driver cameo.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Director Campbell is to be applauded for not approaching this as a 'conventional' Bond film, but instead as a slick thriller that happens to have Bond in it. This film contributed a number of classic scenes to the Bond canon, including the 'jump' at the beginning, the tank sequence and the rendezvous in the sauna. If, like me, you abhorred the cheesy air of Moore's outings, this is the one to prove that it can be done with the sort of elan and charm that Bond himself would approve of. As 'M' might say: ""Welcome back, 007"".",GoldenEye
89,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,The Strongest Pierce Brosnan Bond Film!,9,13 July 2017,"Goldeneye not only resulted in the finest game ever based on a film, but the film itself is also pretty fun. Brosnan is the ideal 90s Bond, where the series was teetering between rejuvenating the good old stuff with newer themes and characters. This was the film that helped Daniel Craig's foray on the character become possible. Whereas Craig does a more modernised take on 007, Brosnan was revising the character's long established traits and his performance can be seen as a critique and breakdown of the James Bond character; and he helped bring Bond to the modern filmgoing crowd and made the transition between Cold-War-paranoia and modern terrorism seem like an easy thing to do.Goldeneye is not the best film of the series, but it's definitely a standout in the overall Bond film canon.",GoldenEye
90,coltras35,Bond returns with a bang ( quite literally),10,15 March 2021,"After a long hiatus the Bond franchise returned with a new actor. Timothy Dalton didn't want to star in many Bond films from Goldeneye as Cubby wanted him to star in more than three, so the role eventually went to Pierce Brosnan, who had, like Roger Moore, been on the verge of donning the famed tux but a TV contract came in the way. And does he fit the role like a glove; from his first appearance upside down above a bog you just buy him in the role, and he plays with a stiff, yet boyishly charming style. Elegant, yet no-nonsense when needed, and is really great with the one-liners ( ""What, no small-talk? No chit-chat? That's the trouble with the world today. No one takes the time to do a really sinister interrogation anymore. It's a lost art."")
The film itself is an extravaganza, plenty of action, well-choreographed ( tank scene) and the plot just flows with no boring bits. But there's some depth, especially when centred around the tragic tone regarding the duplicity of Sean Bean's character. Famke Jansen almost steals the scene as a villain who likes a tight squeeze. That pen twirling bloke who chimes on being invincible is really suitably annoying ( as he is meant to be) and the Bond lead actress was great. Everything is working in this 007 classic.",GoldenEye
91,pyrocitor,Bond... only Bond... and Bond at his very best too!,10,30 April 2006,"After a rather lengthy leave of absence, after what was widely considered to be a less than favourable run from Timothy Dalton in the late 80s, everyone's favourite martini sipping secret agent was given a glorious revival in 1995 with the addition of new Bond Pierce Brosnan. And after such a wonderfully satisfying debut, one starts to wonder what's been keeping him so long - Brosnan seems born to play Bond, effortlessly mastering the panache and charisma that truly make 007 who he is, and he is without a doubt the second best Bond ever, other than Sean Connery. And what gives Brosnan a slight edge is that even though Connery was nothing less than class personified, one always sees him as Sean Connery playing James Bond... whereas we see Brosnan simply as James Bond, he inhabits the role so fully. But Goldeneye is a wonderful film for so many more reasons other than its new lead - a clever and intelligent script most Bond movies simply lacked, with a few genuine surprises and plot twists thrown in later. This intelligent screenplay helps to counterbalance the necessary frequent action sequences, again, not only among the best ever seen in a Bond movie, but among the best in the 90s at all. There are sequences here of the kind that stick with one forever, such as the car/tank chase through St. Petersburg, and Bond leaping from the top of a Russian dam (with his stuntman breaking the world record for highest bungee jump at the same time) and one of the most energetic and satisfying fight scenes of recent movie history at the end. The entire movie is also beautifully shot, with wonderful cinematography which is also mostly unseen in the Bond movies. Even performance-wise, Goldeneye stands far above the average Bond film, with Izabella Scorupco making an intelligent and capable Bond girl, as well as Famke Janssen (soon to be Jean Grey in the X-Men movies) as a truly creepy femme-fatale style dominatrix assassin, specialising in asphyxiating men between her thighs. Hmm... Sean Bean is also a genuinely believable and menacing villain, with none of the camp the average Bond villain displays, and it comes as a genuine surprise when he turns out to be not only back from the dead but also a traitor to MI6 and his country, despite the fact that logically, we know that his role was far too short early on to be completely inconsequential. Judi Dench also makes a strong impression as the new M, Bond's boss, who will take none of his nonsense and has ""no compunctions with sending him to his death. But she won't do it on a whim"". There's also some highly enjoyable little roles from Robbie Coltrane as Russian mobster Valentin Zukovski, a welcome and particularly entertaining scene with Desmond Llewelyn as Q, the MI6 gadgets guru, and Alan Cumming who comes close to stealing the show as incredibly enjoyable computer nerd Boris Grishenko. Overall, Goldeneye is not only essentially the strongest and best made Bond movie since Goldfinger, but a very strong and ridiculously enjoyable and entertaining movie in its own right, surpassing most other 90s action movies in terms of quality and enjoyment factor. Even if you aren't exactly a fan of 007 movies, Goldeneye would be worth checking out - if only to get a sense of Bond at his very best.-10/10",GoldenEye
92,Sirus_the_Virus,Famke Jansen.,10,28 August 2009,"To me, Famke Jansen is the sexiest Bond girl. Not only do I think of her as Jean Grey or his bitch ex-wife in Taken. I think of her as the sexy seductress Xania Onnatopp in Goldeneye. Peirce Brosnan's first and best entry as Bond. Goldeneye is a fantastic Bond film with tons of great action sequences form start to finish. It's such a badass movie also. The film seems like this sexy, stylish action thriller. Because that's what it is. I still have one question about this film though. Is Xania Onnatop squeezing their penis's during sex or what. Because when she's having sex with the captain of the ship he says""Xania...I...can't...breathe""! I've always wondered what she is actually doing to the poor old fart. Goldeneye is a sexy Bond film that deserves the PG-13 rating. Goldeneye is an awesome Bond film that has a great cast and good acting. Goldeneye is one of my favorite Bond film for many reasons. The action sequences are great, I very much like Sean Bean as the villain. Goldenye is an exciting thrill ride form start to finish. The film is just so cool and it's definitely Peirce Brosnan's best performance and Famke Jansen's best performance. Xania Onnatopp isn't the only Bond girl. Izabelle Scorupco plays the other Bond girl. Of course she's not as hot as Xania but she's not as much as a sexy bitch as Xania is. Goldeneye is a fantastic Bond film, and I definitely think you should see it, if you haven't already.The Plot:James Bond teams up with a lone survivor of a Russian research center that was destroyed to stop a seductress and a spy that Bond believed was dead.",GoldenEye
93,jeremycrimsonfox,Pierce Brosnan Makes Bond's Return A Blast,10,17 January 2020,"After failing to stop the theft of the prototype Tiger helicopter, which leads to an abandoned radar station in Severnaya being attacked, the newly-appointed M sends him to investigate, as the Janus Syndicate has control of GoldenEye, an EMP weapon orbiting the earth. Now James must stop their leader, a man who was once an MI6 agent and thought killed during a mission nine years ago, from using GoldenEye to enact his revenge on Britain.This movie came after a six year battle for the distribution rights between MGM and Danjaq. Because of this, the contract of Timothy Dalton (who played Bond in the last film before this) expired, and he declined to a new deal. As a result, 007 here is played by Pierce Brosnan (this being the first of four movies where he played the secret agent). Also replaced is M, who is now a woman played by Judi Dench, and Moneypenny is also recast.The film's plot also takes advantage of the change in the political climate at the time. The first scene is a flashback that takes place in 1986, during the time of the Soviet Union, and the rest of the movie takes place in preset times, where it was dissolved. Thankfully, Bond is still as he is, not affected by the political correctness at the time (even when M calls him out for his behavior), which is good. Also, this is the first Bond film to use CGI, which is used in some places, and it looks so life-like, even if the technique was new at the time. With a good story, action, and the actors doing a good job, this is the Bond film that gave the franchise the revitalization it needed.",GoldenEye
94,Joxerlives,Brosnan's first and (unfortunately) his best,10,13 May 2014,"Really Pierce Brosnan suffered from a great disadvantage with this film. Sean's films got better as they went along, most people agreeing that Goldfinger was his masterpiece. Equally Roger started slow but reached his peak with The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker and Dalton's second effort Licence to Kill was far better than his first, such a shame he wasn't able to continue. Brosnan started brilliantly but then just couldn't keep up the freshness and energy. So we should really value Goldeneye for the mini masterpiece it is. So much good stuff, Pierce is excellent in the role, he just seems to fit in effortlessly to the character and delivers some Moore style humour just as well as the Dalton style toughness. We have a new female M and Judi Dench brings some true class to the part (as she does to virtually everything else she does). The action sequences are terrific, especially the tank chase and the magnificent opening, you're just urging him to run faster as he tries to catch the bike/plane. Wonderful music too both the thumping incidental stuff and Tina Turner's bombastic main theme tune. Nice pair of Bond girls although interesting that the actress who plays the villainess is the one who goes on to huge success rather than the heroine. Joe Don Baker is good as the Felix Leiter replacement and Robbie Coltrane intriguing as Bond's old KGB nemesis, demonstrating how the old certainties have changed in a post Cold War world. Best of all though is the relationship between Bond and Trevalyn, we have a villain with no need for the usual hulking, Oddjob style henchman, he's a match for Bond in every way (and just as sexy, even with his scarred face). He also has a genuine motivation for his actions for once although a rather biased reading of history, Britain never promised the Coassacks anything when they surrendered, it was wishful thinking on their part to think they wouldn't be repatriated to Britain's wartime ally.All told a truly brilliant Bond film and in my top 5.",GoldenEye
95,hnt_dnl,"Not only the best Brosnan as Bond, but one of the top 5!",10,28 July 2012,"I grew up watching the Roger Moore ""Bond"" movies in the 70s and 80s, and watched the Sean Connery ones in repeats. While Connery's Bond was dashing, cheeky, and pompous, Moore's Bond was lusty, quick-witted, and funny, but I still like both actor's interpretations. I do understand why most fans prefer Connery, since he was the first Bond and overall in the better Bond films, but I don't think Moore should be fully persecuted for being stuck in a sequence of rather campy, light 70s flicks that are more attributable to the filmmakers and times. Moore was simply acting with the movie style. All this said, I don't think even all the Connery movies are classics (From Russia with Love and Goldfinger are the best, with the rest being so-so); and Moore starred in one of my all-time favorite Bond movies (The Spy Who Loved Me, with my all-time favorite Bond girl Barbara Bach!); so I feel like Connery and Moore are closer than people think. Sorry for the long rant, but this is actually the FIRST Bond movie that I'm reviewing on this site, so I wanted to provide some perspective! While for differing reasons, I liked both Connery and Moore as Bond, I also really like Pierce Brosnan as well. I actually think (unlike some) that Brosnan got better in each of the 4 Bond movies he starred in. Yet many fans seem to think that Brosnan peaked with this movie, Goldeneye (1995). I think that's partially true. Definitely the best Bond film starring Brosnan, I still think Brosnan was solid Bond in the other 3 as well, successfully carrying on the Bond mantle. I just think Brosnan's later films were grounded somewhat with either dull villains (e.g., Jonathan Pryce in Tomorrow Never Dies, a title which I always manage to forget), unsexy Bond girls (e.g., Michelle Yeoh in, ironically, Tomorrow Never Dies), terrible actresses (e.g., Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough, an actual good Bond movie in spite of her; Halle Berry in Die Another Day, yeah I know Berry has an Oscar, but other than the movie she won for, she's been terrible in every OTHER movie she's been in),or weak/retreaded/overused plots and set pieces (2 of the later Bond movie finales take place in a freakin submarine!).Thankfully, Brosnan's first Bond exercise Goldeneye avoids all the problems with the future ones he starred in. Brosnan himself makes for a great casting choice. He was supposed to be Moore's immediate successor in the late 80s, but he was still starring in the NBC series Remington Steele, which obligated him to finish out the floundering series with a 5-ep finale arc due to the cult fanbase that wanted a proper conclusion to the show. Timothy Dalton stepped in to do 2 Bond movies in the late 80s that weren't very successful and although Dalton performed well for certain circles, the universal desire to see what Brosnan could do with the role won out and eventually, he got his chance with this movie.Brosnan imbibes Bond with a solid mix of dashing, cool, machismo, but has a serious, professional attitude and approach that were kind of lacking in many an earlier Bond flick. While earlier Bond films were a bit too focused on parading hot new actresses in skimpy outfits and the plots were so convoluted to be laughable at times, Goldeneye is the first Bond in an eternity where the main villain's plan made some sense and had a cohesive plot.Sean Bean is exceptional as the main villain, giving a strong acting performance and giving his Bond villain a depth, complexity, and panache that frankly many lacked even in the older, more ""classic"" Bond films. Most of the villains in the early Bonds look very silly and comical in retrospect and it's hard to be captivated by such nonsense. Also, Judi Dench (before she became an Oscar-winning Dame) is rock solid as Bond's superior M (upgraded to female for the 90s), delivering a dignified, convincing performance as the head of MI-6. Now, even though I complained previously about the sexism in earlier Bond movies, a Bond Movie wouldn't be that without beautiful Bond girls! The ones in this are pretty hot and I dare say the sexiest of any of the Bond women that Brosnan had the fortune to work with. Famke Janssen is luscious as the sexy and lethal ""bad"" Bond lady Xenio Onatopp (hilarious name) and Izabella Scorupco is subtle as the genius computer hacker ""good"" Bond lady Natalya Simonova. Although both actresses were fashion models in real life at the time and this was their first big break, both are really excellent in their respective roles and deliver convincing performances and don't just seem like cookie-cutter Bond bimbos as many a previous Bond girl. Their characters just happen to be gorgeous women with true smarts and ability, but the model-actresses really sell their roles.The rest of the cast is great, too, a big reason this is one of the best Bond films ever. Then-newcomer Alan Cumming is infectiously appealing as cocky Russian hacker Boris; Robbie Coltrane is deftly good as Bond frenemy Valentin; and the now-iconic Joe Don Baker (star of all those campy, crappy, so-bad-they're good 70s-80s low-budget ""action"" movies) is used to great effect as Bond's CIA ally. Also, even with the 2 gorgeous women above, Samanth Bond (yeah, I know) is no slouch in the sex appeal department as the new Moneypenny.Also, not only is this a great Bond flick, but one of the better action flicks of the 90s. It's a rare Bond movie that's actually a GOOD movie! Goldeneye moves at a brisk pace, with snappy, humorous, tongue-in-cheek dialog, and has great action scenes. A very fluid action-adventure film from the 90s that happens to be a ""Bond"" movie.",GoldenEye
96,Beta_Gallinger,Perhaps better than any Bond film from the 80's,8,1 November 2008,"After a six year gap, the longest so far in the James Bond movie franchise, they finally returned with a new Bond, Pierce Brosnan, the fifth actor to play the main character in the franchise, starting with the seventeenth installment. Unfortunately, by the 1980's, Roger Moore's best Bond material was behind him. That was the decade when he starred in his last three films in the franchise, and was then replaced by Timothy Dalton for the next two. Personally, I think the best 007 film of the 80's is ""The Living Daylights"", the first of Dalton's two, but this first 90's film in the franchise, ""GoldenEye"", the first of four starring Brosnan, is slightly superior.James Bond is assigned to follow Xenia Onatopp, a former Soviet fighter pilot who now works for a crime syndicate known as Janus. The British agent unfortunately fails to stop her from stealing a powerful Tiger helicopter! She and Russian General Ourumov then go on a killing spree in a bunker in Severnaya, and manage to escape with the control disk for the GoldenEye satellite weapon, which they can cause a lot of damage with (and will if nobody stops them), along with a backstabbing computer programmer named Boris Grishenko! The only other survivor of the attack, and the only one left in the crew who is not on Ourumov and Onatopp's side, is a computer programmer named Natalya Simonova! Bond must now set out on a mission to retrieve the key to Goldeneye before the evil plan is carried out! He is joined on this mission by Natalya, but discovers that Alec Trevelyan, agent 006, who was thought to be killed on a mission in the presence of 007 nine years ago, is still alive, and is now his enemy, no longer his ally! I remember seeing some of this film in the late 90's (I didn't remember its title), but had to see it again in order to see how Pierce Brosnan was as Bond. Now that I've seen the entire thing, after watching all of its predecessors, I can say he is a bit different. I guess he's one of the less serious Bonds, like Roger Moore. One difference I sometimes found was the accent. For example, Brosnan can't seem to say, ""My name is Bond, James Bond,"" like his predecessors could. However, despite his differences, I think his portrayal of the character is decent. He still has his charm. In a Bond film, one would likely hope for suspense, and if you ask me, there's definitely a good amount of that in ""GoldenEye"", including the opening sequence (set nine years before the rest of the movie), and many others that follow during the main course of the movie. One also might hope for some humour, and there's some of that here as well, such as the driving sequence after the opening theme, and sometimes the antics of Boris Grishenko, played by Alan Cumming. The movie may stumble at times, but has enough action, suspense, and humour to make it impressive for the most part.Watching the films in order, 8/10 is the highest I've rated any of them since 1977's ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", which I think is Roger Moore's best. Some would disagree, but many would agree that Pierce Brosnan started well in the role of James Bond with this 1995 spy thriller. While it's no ""Goldfinger"" (it may not even be QUITE as good as ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", though if not, it comes very close), I would say it's one of the stronger films is the franchise, quite intriguing for the most part, unlike some of them. So, after a six year hiatus, they still managed to make a decent Bond film, even though the franchise had been going for over thirty years after starting with Sean Connery, and some believe that no one has managed to match him in the role. If you want a long but thrilling spy film, ""GoldenEye"" could be what you're looking for, and watching it could be quite an experience.",GoldenEye
97,vip_ebriega,"Extending the Plot Possibilities, but still Carries the Classic Bond with it.",8,8 May 2007,"My Take: Brosnan's first performance as Bond is a thrilling spy adventure.""Goldenenye"" marks the new age of Bond. Irish-born Pierce Brosnan gives yet another dimension of character to Her Majesty's best super spy, a tough, yet suave characteristics. The plot, as well, have changed. Instead of throwing back the basics, the writers coped for a more advance plot involving a Russian foe planning to use an advance Soviet helicopter and a space weapon, Goldeneye, to obliterate the western world. This plot is hardly different from all those Cold-War era Bonds, but it just comes to show that even outside his own era, we can always rely on Bond to be a memorable screen hero. The film may have made major changes with the plot, but it still carries the much-loved formula of the original series, and not just carrying it, it reaches it into new heights. Most of the clichés are ignore, in favor of moments with pure excitement. Director Martin Campbell gives a top-notch direction, giving us cliffhangers, suspense, action, and also combining some interesting dialog and fantastic moments were it states ""You don't need CGI to do it."" GOLDENEYE is a most satisfying return for 007, and for the record, it's just as great as some of the the better entries in the series. Rating: **** out of 5.",GoldenEye
98,one9eighty,Ready to save the world again?,8,3 September 2020,"Bond 17 welcomes Pierce Brosnan as the tuxedo wearing MI6 secret agent. Besides Brosnan, a lot has changed since the last outing for Bond in the film franchise, and this film sees an almost re-birth of the franchise for the 1990'sReleased in 1995 this film was directed by Martin Campbell, who would later go on to direct Daniel Craig in ""Casino Royal"" too. Campbell replaced John Glen who worked on 5 Bond films and reinvigorated the franchise during the 80's. Michael France steps in as writer replacing Richard Maibaum (who worked on 14 Bond films) and Michael G. Wilson (who stepped into a Production role), with Jeffrey Caine and Bruce Feirstein writing the screenplay. Ian Fleming of course is the mastermind behind the main characters in this, although the story is not based on any of his books - which is the first time that a completely original version of Bond has hit the screen. Eric Serra steps up into music department which John Barry previously monopolised. While some of Barry's original scoring is present still, Serra brings an updated score to a fresh new generation of Bond. The theme song to accompany the open credits was ""Goldeneye"" which was sung by Tina Turner. Previously the production team for the film would work with the musical artists so that themes of the film were incorporated into the song, but not this time. This time the song was written by Bono and The Edge from the band U2. Also, noteworthy, Albert R. Broccoli took a step away due to ill health and was mainly a consultant, his daughter Barbara took up his production role with his stepson Michael G. Wilson. Unfortunately, Albert would die 7 months after the release of this film. Running at 130 minutes this film had a budget of $60 million and grossed a whopping $352 million - which makes Bond's relaunch a massive success.The most obvious refresh is in the title character, Pierce Brosnan replaces Timothy Dalton. Dalton was due to come back, but due to legal wrangling this production of this film did not start for 4-5 years, by which time Dalton's contract had expired. He initially agreed he would come back for a single film, but Broccoli wanted him to sign on for 4-6 films which Dalton did not want to do. So rather than renewing Dalton at all, Broccoli turned to Irishman Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan had been considered for the role prior to Dalton, but he was committed to an NBC contract to play ""Remmington Steele"". The writers did adapt the version of Bond for Brosnan as best as they could, but the fact of the matter remains, the film was written with Dalton in mind for the title role, which is why there is still a darkness to the character. It's amusing to look back at other people considered for the role, the studio considered Mel Gibson (they considered him before choosing Dalton in the 80's too), Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and even Paul McGann were considered. In his role, Brosnan is brilliant, he manages to combine the approach other Bond actors gave; he manages to be as dark as Dalton, as witty and charming as Moore, and as direct and professional as Connery (sorry Lazenby, you didn't get a mention because in one film you didn't manage to stamp your mark on the franchise). Not only does he manage to combine other Bond performances, but he also manages to put his own classy stamp on the film, he is cool, stylish, and savvy. His Bond is every part an action hero but dressed down in comfortable clothes.As well as Bond being recast, some of the regular reoccurring characters were recast too. Judi Dench replaces Robert Brown as Bond's MI6 boss ""M"". This was a bold move but was not the first time a female boss was considered. When Lois Maxwell was about to step away from playing Miss Moneypenny she suggested a female ""M"" which was actually considered, but the eventual decision was that the world wasn't ready yet. In the 1990's the world was a little more ready for a female boss, but regardless of is it was ready or not, Judi Dench absolutely commanded the role and stole the attention when she was in frame. Miss Moneypenny was recast with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond. She does not appear for a long time, but she is witty and charming for her time on screen. The only actor from the reoccurring characters to survive the refresh was Desmond Llewelyn as Q. There are some new reoccurring characters that are introduced here, which I can mention with the benefit of hindsight. Joe Don Baker is CIA operative Jack Wade, replacing the Felix Leiter character that came before him. The character is portrayed as a bumbling loud, chubby American which is in complete contrast to the mannerisms of Bond. Choosing this stereotype of a character seems like it's very tongue in cheek, but because Wade doesn't get a lot of screen time it works well. Robbie Coltrane's Valentin Zukovsky is also a character that you will see again in the next Bond film. Coltrane's portray is decent but not absolutely necessary. It feels like he is shoehorned in for a little bit of comedic relief - which is further backed up by his on-screen girlfriend (played by Minnie Driver) and her terrible singing.There are three main villains in this film, General Ourumov (Gottfried John), Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) and Alec Treveluyan (Sean Bean). All three of which give varying but great performances that are different from other villains that Bond has faced before. Ourumov is the maniacal Russian general with a hidden agenda, he is menacing and dangerous. Onatopp is a very over the top henchwoman but she is unmistakably a powerful female in a Bond film who poses as much as threat as 007. Famke Janssen does well in the role and brings to life a performance which I feel could have been a lot cheesier. Sean Bean sits at the top of the bad guy pyramid and he is great. The character is supposed to the decedent of Lienz Cossacks, who worked with MI6 for a long time to cover up his plot for revenge. He does great to play a charming character that is extremely dangerous. I am not too keen on Bean's quintessential English accent in this film, I prefer it when he's true to his Yorkshire roots, but ignoring his accent his performance is very strong. Sean Bean's role could have been played by Alan Rickman or Anthony Hopkins but they turned it down. Hopkins would again be approached for a role in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" only to turn it down again then. The use of a former MI6 agent as the lead protagonist in the film was a change from using archetypal bad guys such as Nazi's, drug lords, or mad scientists. This was partly down to the changing times of the era. Worldwide politics had changed dramatically since ""License to Kill"", this was actually the first Bond film after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and after the end of the Cold War; the Berlin wall in Germany had also come down too. The new bad guys were the ones sat at the end of a computer who had the power to bring down nations with the press of a keyboard button. It was important that Bond changed with the times and it did that by having Alan Cumming's Boris character as the computer whizz, controlled by the former intelligence agent that Sean Bean portrayed.Izabella Scorupco as Natalya is the typical Bond girl of the film, but with her computer knowledge she is more than just eye-candy. At different times she allows the plot to continue advancing with the information and solutions she puts in front of Bond. It is fair to say without this character the film would not advance the way it does. Scorupco does a lovely job in the role demonstrates a wide range of emotions that she puts on plate for the audience to empathise with her. Alan Cumming is her technical counterpart then nemesis in the role. I found this character to be slightly annoying at times but again he is integral to the plot. The fact that I considered the character to be annoying is testament to Cumming's performance, if he invokes emotion then he has done well.So, there were a lot of firsts in the film, more firsts came in the studio used. This was the inaugural film to be shot at Leavesden Studios. It was also the first Bond film to use CGI too. Add to that the casting changes and the production team changes, and you have a Bond film that on the surface may look familiar, but the parts are all new. Like a classic car that has had a new engine added, an approach that seemed to work as audiences loved this Bond film and it won plenty of plaudits and awards. The name Goldeneye comes from a manoeuvre that Ian Fleming took part in while with the Naval Intelligence Division, it is also the name of his estate in Jamaica.All in all, I really enjoyed the film. I consider it to be a fantastic rebirth of the franchise and all the players from cast and the production team do a great job. Its family friendly enough that kids or grandparents can watch it without being upset or offended, but it is equally able to be a grown-up film with lots of action and intelligence in it too. The film is everything that you would expect or want from a Bond film and with Brosnan able to combine all the other Bond performances in his portrayal in this film, it should make fans new and old happy. I am happy to recommend this film and I am certain you'll have fun watching it too.In terms of Bond films this is a 9 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 8 out of 10.",GoldenEye

100,adamscastlevania2,Brosnan's best Bond movie,7,29 August 2014,"(66%) A fine rebirth after a 6 year hiatus between 89's ""Licence to kill"" featuring the very charismatic Brosnan, some great action set pieces, and a more grown-up feel. Scourupco's character is quite unique in that she has a decent level of screen time without Bond present, and she's also given important things to do rather than just looking pretty and helping out in quite minor ways, which is quite refreshing. Bean is great, and Janssen plays sadistic beauty very well. And although the movie was an update, it still subtlety looked back on both the series and on history in general. This is a good Bond movie, that also can boast the all-time greatest video game tie-ins ever.",GoldenEye
101,Holt344,"One of my personal favorite Bond movies, it's the best with Pierce Brosnan",10,15 February 2019,"From the intro sequence to the climax of the mivus movie we get to go on a ride so awesome, entertaining and epic. That's probably one of the most iconic scenes in movie history. Martin Campbell directed the first Bond movie in the modern days of the Bond movies and he succeeds with creating a original story with two villains, Alec (006) and Xenia Onatopp which is played perfectly by Sean Bean and Famke Janssen. Their performances and the writing for the characters are what make them unique and superb villains. Pierce Brosnan is James Bond, one of my favorite Bond actors and he plays the part a lot like Sean Connery but bringing his own to the character in a perfect way. The rest of the ensemble cast is perfect. The story and plot flows well with the action sequences, making sense and with fresh take of Bond we get a more darker and realistic James Bond which fits the tone and vision that Martin Campbell wanted for the movie.The fight sequences is top notch, focusing more on realistic fight choreography and showing off the skills that James Bond has. That tank sequence is always entertaining to watch and the final showdown between 007 and 006 goes down for one of the best and most epic showdown of Bond villains.",GoldenEye
102,stamper,"Beaches, Babes and BMW's",9,16 October 2001,"This film marked the return of James Bond, 007 to the big screen. And I must say it was quite the big bang. It brought into the cash register about 350 Million Dollars (Tomorrow Never Dies did slightly worse and The World is not Enough did (very) slightly better). Still, having seen all three 007 movies I must say that it is the best Bond of the 1990's. That might be strange, regarding the fact that it was the first offering since 1989 when Timothy Dalton lead the famous character into a deep, black hole. I'd never dare to say that Dalton was the worst Bond ever (thank god for him there's George Lazenby!) but I must say he kind of brought the series to a low point for me. Pierce Brosnan though, miraculously came shooting out of that black hole, flying sky  high towards the stars. He immediately formed the best original Bond (Connery) substitute ever (in my opinion), by making this film.
This one has everything that defines a classic, though none of the names to do so. Then (back in 1995) every actor that starred in this film was pretty much a blank to the average audience member. Something that didn't remain like that for long and rightly so. Famke Janssen (Xenia Onatopp) came to star in X  Men (and the sequel next year I guess), Minnie Driver (Irina) made Sleepers, Good Will Hunting and gave her voice to Jane in Tarzan, Sean Bean (006) will make himself immortal this and the next few years in J.R.R. Tolkiens The Fellowship of the Ring, Judi Dench (M) made Shakespeare in Love (apart from the other Bond films that is), Izabella Scorupco (Natalya Simonova) made The Vertical Limit, Martin Campbell (the Director) made The Mask of Zorro and The Vertical Limit and Brosnan, well he (of course) became the most successful Bond EVER!
Back to this film though. I must say this one has everything a Bond film should have. A great story, exotic locations, action, beautiful women, fast cars and a lot of gags. It are of course these typical Bond things that make this film what it is. But it is the great direction, acting and script that make this a dream come true for filmfreaks. Every character is cast brilliantly, beginning (of course) with Pierce Brosnan and ending with Minnie Driver, who is in only one scene but still makes me laugh. And so does almost every character in this film. Bond's famous innuendo's are (again) brilliant and funny, but so are some the comments Miss Simonova makes. Whereas Miss Onatopps can even make me laugh just by means of facial expression. I mean the character Famke Janssen portrays is just plain and simple cool. She is just this sexy sadist who can crush people with her thighs. Which brings me to another good thing about this installment. There are by no means even hints or suggestions to why Miss Onatopp is enabled to kill people by breaking their backs with her thighs. They don't even try to explain, she just can do that. That I think is great, because if you are honest you must say ever attempt to explain this phenomenon would have been laughable.
The direction is splendid as well and focuses on the most important things a bond movie has to offer: shiny new vehicles, action, exotic locations and babes. These things are all captured very well by Martin Campbell and I must say that my favorite scene in the whole move (direction  wise) is the beach scene' with Miss Scorupco and Mister Brosnan.  Not only does Martin Campbell capture the beauty of the surroundings and Izabella Scorupco here, but he also captures the dilemma of being James Bond. It is just a wonderful scene and I think show Bonds weak spot for the first time in the series. All in all I cannot do anything else as to highly recommend this film to you. Even if you don't like James Bond or maybe even just if you do not like that character. Because let's face it, everyone who likes him has already seen this movie.

103,ivo-cobra8,GoldenEye is my number 1 favorite James Bond 007 action film of all time - the best one,10,30 October 2017,"GoldenEye (1995) is my number 1 personal favorite movie of all time! James Bond 007 action film the best one that was ever made. In my opinion it is the best one I love this movie to death! I grew up watching it as a child and Pierce Brosnan is my number 1 favorite James Bond. GoldenEye is the first film to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.I'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that Pierce Brosnan is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. The reason because it is my favorite it is because I feel it is just action, action , action and more action. I never feel bored with it, or it is too over long like some Bond movies are it is fast paced, entertaining and hard core action. The plot is simply and the story never get's bored. It is a beautiful movie, with beautiful direction from Martin Campbell. The stunts are completely insane in scale in this movie and really dangerous.Music score is by Éric Serra, the title song is GoldenEye performed by Tina Turner. GoldenEye was released in 1995 after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast, with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond: Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise his role, as Q. GoldenEye was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot.Style and sophistication are in abundance - - ""The name's Bond. James Bond."" Goldeneye's female characters are honestly beautiful with particular techniques. The bad one is Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), an ex-Soviet fighter pilot who tranquilly smokes big cigars and knocks off her victims with her 'killer thighs.' In one scene, she challenges Bond's legendary Aston Martin DB5 to a wild road race outside Monte Carlo with her red Ferrari: in another she was so smart that she snatches a top-secret helicopter from under the noses of the French navy. Izabella Scorupco is a great and the finest Bond girl, the irresistible Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) who 'tastes like strawberries.' Natalya possesses all the technical ability to neutralize Janus' scheme or to destroy all computer records with the GoldenEye As one who survived a mass murder, this lovely beauty is suddenly a marked woman.James Bond investigates the theft of the control disk for the GoldenEye satellite. His investigation leads to an organization of arms dealers Janus and the reappearance of someone from Bond's past. James Bond must deal with betrayal of his old friend Alec Trevelyan (006) gone rogue, from using a satellite GoldenEye against London to cause a global financial meltdownWhy I also love this movie to death beside the action is because of the great villains who created evil characters. Such as: Sean Bean as Alec Trevelyan (006), Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp: A Georgian lust murderer, Gottfried John as General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov and Alan Cumming as Boris Grishenko: A computer programmer.It was filmed in beautiful locations in Puerto Rico, Russia, England, UK and in the France.The movie has a lot of insane hard-core action (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), The stunts are completely insane in scale (bungee jumping in - Arkangel Chemical Weapons Facility a stunt man performed that stunt in the opening scene.) Bond with a motorcycle jumps on a plane and catches it. Bond drives a tank in Russia for the first time and he demolishes even police cars that was excellent scene. Bond a stuntman jumps out of the window in Russia. Alec Trevelyan's train depot - exploding train. The epic climatic fight on the end of the movie between Bond and Trevelyan in his secret Goldeneye satellite control dish in Cuba in which Bond drops Trevelyan out of dish beautiful and really crazy stunt performance.I love the soundtracks in this movie: Goldeneye by Tina Turner and The Experience of Love by Éric Serra. I just love everything about this movie from the actions, to the heroes, to the villains from acting everything abut this movie I just love so much.GoldenEye (1995) is the seventeenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.10/10 my favorite James Bond number 1 movie. This film is amazing Totally mind-blowing I love it.",GoldenEye
104,juliankennedy23,The one where he drives the tank.,8,13 March 2019,"GoldenEye: 8 out of 10: Pierce Brosnan takes over as Bond in the superspy's first post-cold war outing as he takes revenge for the death of Sean Bean by driving a tank through King's Landing.The Good: There are some things that GoldenEye does better than most bond outings.1. First off are the bond girls: Izabella Scorupco is perfect as the Damsel in Distress/ Girl next Door love interest while Famke Janssen isn't just one of the best femme fatales in the Bond series she is easily one of the best henchman (Henchwoman?).2. The stunts and action beats are downright excellent all across the board. For a rather long film, it doesn't feel it with a good pace that takes a breather every once in a while.3. In addition, Pierce Brosnan is a breath of fresh air in the role and acts as if he had been playing it for years.
The Bad: There also some Bond tropes that are particularly painful in this one.1. Whoever wrote Bonds one-liners in this film needs to be shaken as well as stirred. The snarky quotes manage to both take one out of the scene and appear desperate.2. Look I know that ""I don't want you to talk Mr. Bond I want you to die"" is clearly a lie in these films as no one seems willing to just shoot Bond once captured. Goldeneye takes this to an extreme where an unconscious Bond is left in a puzzle box with all his gadgets over and over again. (Leaving him in a jet cockpit was particularly pathetic) Even by the weighted scale of a Bond villain, these are some pretty bad efforts.The Ugly: Pierce Brosnan attacks Minnie Driver's off-key singing. Look Brosnon I saw Mama Mia you have no right to ever criticize anyone's singing ever.
In Conclusion: While Goldeneye is better remembered for the videogame it spun off than the movie itself it remains Pierce Brosnan's strongest outing and a very entertaining film in its own right.",GoldenEye
105,eminkl,"A new cornerstone, just where one was most desperately needed",8,17 April 2020,"Pierce Brosnan's debut behind the martini glass is easily the best Bond movie since Sean Connery first quit the role, nearly thirty years prior. Everything just seems to click for Brosnan, who deftly balances the tricky contrast between suave, romantic espionage and blunt, campy excess while still, somehow, seeming cool and in-command. He's familiar but replenished, a character we've grown to appreciate over the course of sixteen preceding films, cast in a new light. No growing pains whatsoever - this agent hits the ground running. The plot's emphasis on post-Soviet decay provides a long-sought modern backdrop to the series (at the time of its release, at least), while opening the door for all sorts of fresh concepts, unique characters and fascinating set pieces. Bond's fleeting showdown with an ex-comrade (Sean Bean, in a fantastic villainous turn) amid a cluster of stylish, discarded Russian monuments is a particular standout in that respect. It's not perfect, by any means - the tech bits are laughable, the timeline's a mess, it's overly long - but it's undeniably fun to watch, colorful and edgy and hip, and a decided return to form for a series that had been floating, directionless, for quite a while. A new cornerstone, just where one was most desperately needed.",GoldenEye

107,Angry_Arguer,Return to Form,10,14 July 2003,"The James Bond series is never about clever plots or inventive dialogue. They cannot be considered either high art for obvious reasons or inventive due to their lack of developement.  Yet we are consistently reminded of them because of their time-tested formula that, until lately, seemed invincible.GoldenEye brought agent OO7 into the post-Cold War and brought the best production values to the series ever.  The plot itself acts like a cross between John Badham's WarGames and Blue Thunder with the typical Bond hook. Throw in some political correctness and rather brutal gunfights and voila! Instant blockbuster in a can.  While some of the set-piece battles seemed absurd to the point of criminal insanity, I couldn't help but marvel at how the producers make us buy it all with a smile.  Thankfully, the movie contains decent effects, but doesn't let the effects overwhelm the attempt at storytelling unlike Tomorrow Never Dies and Die Another Day.  This was when the studio still had to fret about their budget.While on the technical level everything feels fine, the acting is surprisingly good.  Not great and certainly nowhere near the level of, say, Silence of the Lambs, but it is better than Weekend at Bernie's.  Brosnan proves he has the Bond wit and charm, so sad that the rest of his films are all downhill from here.  While it does run rather long, you can be assured that GoldenEye can provide some thrills every few minutes to hold your attention without relying on the MTV effect of the later films.  I dig the ""darker"" nature of this film, much in the same vein as Batman Returns, but not as gothic.Overall, enjoyable, yet dense, entertainment that ranks in my Top 5 Bond movies.  3 out of 5 stars.",GoldenEye

111,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,No Bond movie does it better,9,8 December 2007,"After being out of action for over five years with his future uncertain Bond, James Bond, leaped back into action with this exciting spy thriller. In his first outing as the famous spy (oxymoron?) Pierce Brosnan flawlessly captures the suave, cool, and handsome secret agent. He is arguably the best since Sean Connery. Main reason being that this Bond is not afraid to get down and dirty with our hero taking more than a convincing beating during the course of his mission. Yet, despite this edge, the boyish factor of unreality that Bond has come to portray is still here. The opening sequence ranks as one of the best of the series with a bungee jump, infiltration, shootout and finally a jump off of a huge cliff to get into a falling empty plane. No kidding. It's not just the open scene though. The rest of the movie has spectacular action sequences including a breakneck tank/car chase through St. Petersburg that's packed with fireworks and grade-A vehicular destruction.The plot is also a nice update. It keeps much of the series Cold War based roots, but brings them into a new and fresh field. For once the Russians aren't just simply bad and end of story. There is a little more intricately designed plot with betrayals and some interesting revelations. The old cat stroking millionaire villain with his own private army was fun at first, but it was growing stale. With this reworked formula there is serious room for espionage. The plot is more reminiscent of a Robert Ludlum novel than the previous Bond plots. It is more rooted in our real world. Looking back at previous Bond films, you can see that slowly manifesting itself such as the Silicon Valley plot in ""A View to a Kill"" and the drug-lord villain in ""Licence to Kill."" Now with with ""Goldeneye"" Bond hasn't necessarily made himself more believable, that would ridiculous, but certainly more credible. His goals seem more real than before. The danger seems more real. There also isn't a heavy use of gadgetry with only a few relatively basic devices - a detonator in a watch, a laser in a watch, an explosive pen and a handy belt. That is ultimately the movies only letdown, but given that also makes Bond rely on his own brain and brawn and not some computer.Last year's ""Casino Royale"" tried to take Bond even a step further with its grittiness, but that was simply overkill. Bond is not and cannot be gritty to be enjoyed. Brosnan played the part perfectly while Craig made him a macho tough guy that hits harder than he thinks. Surprisingly Martin Campbell directed both ""Goldeneye"" and ""Casino Royale"" so maybe it was he he took it that unnecessary step further. Either way, he is forgiven for delivering ""Goldeneye"" - the best Bond movie thus far and probably ever. --- 9/10Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action. Ages 13+",GoldenEye

Pierce Brosnan's first appearance as James Bond made audiences realize that he WAS James Bond. The acting is great. Sean Bean, Izabella Scorupco, Alan Cumming, Famke Janssen, Joe Don Baker and Judi Dench are all wonderful. This is indeed one of the greatest action films ever made, other than being just the greatest Bond film.The action sequences are intense and it follows the later Nintendo 64 game pretty closely (or the game follows the movie rather). There are some notable and memorable quotes and comebacks. I love how Bond takes the numerous enemies in this film and slowly justifies their wrongs, one by one. The film is filled with narrow escapes, close calls and tons of gun violence. But, hey, that's what spy movies are all about. This is a total must-see for every Bond fan and for every action fan.

The movie is also excellent. Although Brosnan looks somewhat slight (he bulked up for his later outings), he nevertheless made a convincing Bond amalgamating much of what his predecessors have done with the role. His nemesis, 006 played by Sean Bean was a very interesting villain (the concept of a fellow agent gone bad was borrowed by Woo and Cruise for MI:2) and their familiarity made their eventual confrontations all the more intriguing. Boris as the nerdy computer hacker henchman was a welcome departure from the brawny baddies of Bonds past. Gottfried John as Orumov was very good as well, his main job being to nail that Russian accent. As for the Bond girls Natalya had a nice girl next door look and Xenia, almost played over the top by Jansen certainly got viewers' attentions. The stunts (especially the bungee jump off the dam and the tank chase) and set pieces (notably the antenna cradle and base) also added to the splendor of the picture.

This installment certainly returned with a bang—rightfully so—after a five-and-a-half year hiatus from 1989's LICENSE TO KILL. Bond is assigned by M (Judi Dench) to prevent an arms syndicate from using a satellite weapon (the GoldenEye; titled as an homage to series creator Ian Fleming's Jamaican estate) to cause worldwide financial destruction. Despite not focusing too long on development, the cast does an excellent job bringing to life extremely interesting characters—which is quite a feat for an episodic spy film—such as: Brosnan, Bean, a sadistic Janssen, Dench, John, an underused Coltrane, Llewelyn (of course), and especially Cumming even Billy J. Mitchell's death-face is classic. Éric Serra's score is untouchable (save the ridiculous car-racing scene immediately following the amazing opening sequence).

Year in year out, the Bond franchise was growing enough cash to dare be a little more creative. But after a 6-year break the producers understood they'd better stop quarreling, so they were eager to switch on the cash machine again.I prefer to think Goldeneye became the biggest 007 success thanks to the 6-year break. Audiences have had time to breathe and after a 6-year leave it's a real comeback not just a periodical show/nuisance. Because to me Goldeneye is a reel nuisance. A James Bond movie is not top art -ok- that is just meant to be entertaining. But imagine a fast entertainment theme park: you got a 3 min credit to get entertained here, 2 1/2 min there, 1 min for a pee stop and so on for every attraction. This is Goldeneye: everything is fake and jerky. First, Pierce Brosnan is dull. The storyline is heavy-handed yet not so heavy as the PP shots (Product Placement) for BMW, Omega or Perrier (did Eurocopter pay?). Tina Turner has been called as a substitute for Shirley Bassey and her memorable Goldfinger song. Eventually continuity makes as much sense as in a video game. This blinker clinging flick starts with Bond jumping down a dry and warm valley only to emerge a little latter at the top of a snowy mountain, and the end is a shameless carbon copy of 'You Only Live Twice (1967)' (qv).Before Goldeneye I had seen the whole series on TV.

The movie is basically the cut scenes from the video game except with the movie you never get to play the game.

Also in the game you could unlock new characters, guns, levels and outfits, but in the movie you cant unlock anything.

Pierce Brosnan is a solid James Bond.Pierce Brosnan delivers a fun and suave James Bond in his portrayal. The only criticism I have is that it often seems like Pierce Brosnan is not trying. Much of the problems that James Bond encounters are life threatening. Pierce Brosnan makes these scenes appear as though he has no struggle or he has seen it before. Sean Bean as Alec Trevelyan has an understandable motivation and his performance by Sean Bean is one of the best parts of the movie.

But soon legal issues would overtake the series, delaying work on the seventeenth Bond film for years. By the time work would begin again in earnest, the Cold War that had dominated the first three decades of the series had ended. This, combined with Timothy Dalton departing the role of 007 left many fan to wonder if 007 had indeed fought his last battle. 1995's Goldeneye was a result touted as the film that would make or break the series for the 1990s. Thankfully for Bond fans, Goldeneye succeeded.Goldeneye's successful re-launch was in no part thanks to Pierce Brosnan's debut as 007. Having barely missed out on playing the part in The Living Daylights, Brosnan had long been considered for the role and in Goldeneye, Brosnan shows why. His characterization is, to a certain extent, an amalgamation of what others had brought to the role previously. He has the sleek and dangerous shark quality of Connery, the charm of Moore (whom he outshines without problem) and yet also brings the sensitive and coldblooded elements that Dalton brought to the role as seen, respectively, in the scene between Bond and Natalya on the beach and in the final line he delivers before dispatching his enemy to his death. Brosnan's Bond may be an amalgamation of his predecessors but it is certainly a successful one.Izabella Scorupco as Natalya Simonova is an interesting character to say the least. Clearly, the filmmakers were trying to bring the role of the Bond girl into the 1990s by making her a more independent and well-rounded character. Natalya Simonova does this, but with mixed results. Even in individual scenes, like the entire section set at Severnaya, the character fluctuates between Bond girl extremes. Thankfully, Izabella Scorupco plays the role well though at times it's clear that even the actress is struggling between the extremes the character keeps bouncing between.More successful is Sean Bean as Alec Trevelyan, 006 and later Bond's adversary. The character's introduction is the film's teaser sequence sets up the character as a good guy, a friend of Bond lost in the line of duty. That scene though is only setting the audience up for one of the best plot twists in the history of the Bond films: 006 has turned traitor. While Bean is clearly too young for the reasoning to be 100% believable, Bean makes the successful transition from ally to villain in one incredible scene. Bean is just as importantly believable in the climatic fight that bits two former friends against each other with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. While lacking all the three-dimensional characterization of his immediate predecessor, Alec Trevelyan comes across as one of the better villains of the series and a true threat to Bond.The supporting cast also serves the film well for the most part. Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp has become one of the film's most iconic elements though sadly the character rides the thin line between good and cringe worthy a bit too much with Onatopp, like Natalya, being all over the place in terms of quality. The rest of the supporting cast suit the film much better including Joe Don Baker as CIA agent Jack Wade, Gottfried John as General Ourumov, Robbie Coltrane as Valentin Zukovsky and Alan Cumming as Boris Grishenko. The film also introduces several new members to the MI6 staff including a female M played to perfection by Judi Dench, a more combative Miss Moneypenny in the form of Samantha Bond and MI6 chief of staff Bill Tanner played by Michael Kitchen as well as the ever welcomed return of Desmond Llewelyn as Q.Goldeneye also boasts some of the best action sequences of the series, something that was all important for it to bring Bond into the 1990s. The teaser sequence features not one but two impressive stunts as well as gun play. The film's most impressive action sequences though come in its back half from the running gun battle through a government archive and the iconic (and surprisingly still incredible impressive) tank chase through St Petersburg while the film's climax hearkens back to the Bob Simmons staged fights of the early Connery films. The results are impressive, even seventeen years on.Perhaps the biggest problem that affects Goldeneye is that it has become oddly dated. The plot hinges heavily on the computer technology of the early/mid-1990s which looks oddly out of place when viewed from a perspective of seventeen years later. It isn't just technology though that has dated the film but certain aspects of its plot as well. The reveal of Alec Trevelyan being a Lienz Cossack and the film's setting in the early post-Soviet era Russia have also dated the film significantly. While this can be to the detriment of films as they age (see the space race elements of You Only Live Twice), Goldeneye manages to fall into the same category as For Your Eyes Only in that those elements date the film but don't detract too much from enjoying it.As the vehicle to bring 007 into the 1990s, Goldeneye is an unqualified success. When viewed from seventeen years later, it has its elements which work better than others while it has oddly dated in some ways. Goldeneye though remains one of the better Bond films thanks to Brosnan's excellent debut as Bond, memorable characters and action sequences that stand up years later. Bond was back in action and here to stay.",GoldenEye
122,redkiwi,Monsiuer Bond est BACK!,8,14 December 2000,"Ah, the renaissance of James Bond under Pierce Brosnan after the awful non-appearances of Timothy Dalton.Point of interest: Pierce Brosnan's Christian name is an anagram of Recipe.The Goldeneye, a former Soviet piece of technology that can render any electronic equipment harmless falls into the wrong hands, those of Sean Bean - formerly 006 and friend of Bond.This plays excellently on the paranoia of some in the West about former Soviet technologies falling into the wrong hands, and is Bond back to his best.  Despite being a little predictable at times, this was very good and worth watching throughout.Famke Janssen as Onatopp was worth watching it for alone, she was hilarious!",GoldenEye
123,Bogmeister,BOND#17: Eye on the New 007 for the Nineties,8,28 July 2007,"MASTER PLAN: utilize the new Goldeneye device to destroy all electronic banking records, throwing England into a dark age. After an absence of six years (since ""License to Kill""), a new era in Bondism dawns; everything, out of necessity, is new: a new Bond, a new M, a new Moneypenny and a whole new world, without the Soviet Iron Curtain which dominated the Bonders in the eighties. Well, Q is still here - the same old Q; he shows up in a wheelchair and we think, oh my - he's not doing well; but, it's all part of the sleight-of-hand during the gadget-facility scene. The teaser starts things off right, beginning with a spectacular bungee-cord jump and ending with a stunt that attempts to surpass the best teaser of all time - the one from ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" The only way to beat that one was to show something unbelievable and this does, but so what? It's Bond. It's also interesting that the teaser takes place nine years earlier, which would place it around the time of the first Dalton Bonder. Tina Turner sings over the strange and even, at the time, controversial credits, which depict Bond girls smashing symbols of the Soviet regime - oh-oh, a subversive, subliminal message here? Probably without meaning to, the filmmakers gave the new Bonder some edge for the nineties.Six years doesn't really sound like a long time but it almost looks like we've entered a new century since the previous Bonder. There's a heavy emphasis on computer technology and both the white hats & the evildoers seem to rely on these new advances, most of which did not exist in the eighties. Some of the dialog reflects this passage of time, such as when M, a female successor to the post, voices her negative overview of what Bond represents - or, what he used to represent. There's also a decidedly different flavor to the relationship between Bond and MI6 HQ, including Bond's bond with Moneypenny - certainly not the warm relationship we'd seen between Connery & Maxwell, for example. Ironically, there's a coldness here even though the Cold War is over, maybe because they're not teamed against the Soviets any longer. We kind of expect M (the always effective Dench) to criticize Bond, but nice Moneypenny? However, the scene where they all watch an electronic map as the pulse goes off is excellent, suggesting close teamwork. Brosnan does well as the new Bond and it's fortunate he didn't get the part earlier as planned - he's just the right age here. He doesn't have Connery's power but he also doesn't indulge in as much awful smirking as Moore, creating a well-balanced interpretation. He's a bit more emotional than those two old-timers, letting loose with a great big smile more than once, but he's also very serious when he needs to be, sometimes switching to a grim outlook almost abruptly. The tension is there, unlike the Moore version, but he also has a nearly superhuman competency, which is what 007 needs.The mission begins in beautiful Monte Carlo (cards, anyone?), featuring the return of the Aston Martin, a spiffy auto race and the theft of a special helicopter. Bond then visits the new Russia in St.Petersburg, where there's a prolonged chase with a tank. He ends up somewhere in Cuba, searching for a huge satellite dish - this reminds of the fake lake from the humongous ""You Only Live Twice"" days. The villain ends up being former agent 006, whose closest parallel among past Bond villains is the assassin of ""The Man With the Golden Gun,"" who was presented as Bond's opposite number, like an evil brother. Alec, 006, is the scarred, twisted version of 007 and makes a great opponent simply by virtue of his backstory. He's certainly not two-dimensional and you wonder just how bad can this guy really be if he was such good friends with Bond? Since he thinks like Bond and can perhaps out-think him, their final battle has that extra punch. The super-henchwoman, Onatopp, made quite an impression on me when I first saw this; when I viewed this again, her repeated orgasms during all her action/kill scenes became a bit silly and tiresome by the 3rd or 4th time. But, her final fight with Bond is also well done. Jack Wade replaces the crippled Leiter as Bond's CIA liaison; actor Baker hams it up. The femme fatale (gorgeous volatile Scorupco), the secondary villain (a Russian general) and a couple of other amusing characters (Boris, Valentin) are well drawn, adding to the overall adventure. This was a pretty intelligent and exciting restart for the series, though individual stand-out scenes are better than the overall uneven structure. Bond would return in ""Tomorrow Never Dies.""

124,moviesleuth2,The Perfect Bond Movie,10,23 May 2009,"I'm not going to lie and say that I've seen every James Bond movie ever made. But I will say that of the ones that I have seen, ""GoldenEye"" remains my favorite. And that's not just because it spawned off one of the best video games ever created.This is Pierce Brosnan's first outing as the tuxedo-wearing and martini (""Shaken, not stirred"")-drinking superspy, and as usual for franchises, it's the best of his outings. He brings a clever wit to the proceedings that makes him instantly likable, and his charm is irresistible. Yet Brosnan doesn't allow Bond to become a one-note character. He gets angry, and feels pain (lots of it). But Brosnan is talented enough to handle it all. The producers made a great decision by picking Brosnan to reinvigorate the 007 franchise.Now to the plot...James Bond is back. After a mission left another 00-agent dead, Bond become embroiled in a mission that forces him to face his old demons. A new, top-secret satellite called GoldenEye has been stolen by a renegade Russian general (Gottfried John) and his psychotic femme fatale partner (Famke Janssen). Now, he has to team up with a mousy computer programmer (Isabella Scorupco) to find out where they're going to use it next.Apart from Brosnan, another recurring character has been replaced. That is M, now being played by Judi Dench. Like Brosnan, she brings an element of wit to her character, and few British ladies have the acid tongue that Dench gives to her character.There are three things that James Bond movies are known for (apart from Bond himself): over-the-top action sequences, exotic locales, and gorgeous babes. ""GoldenEye"" does not disappoint.The film boasts two women, and both of them are very easy on the eyes. They are also played by capable actresses. Natalya, played by Scorupco, is not drop-dead gorgeous in the traditional sense, but she is sympathetic, and alternately tough and vulnerable. Most importantly, she has terrific chemistry with Brosnan. The other, Xenia Onatopp, as played by Jannsen, is completely opposite. While she is a knockout, she's a complete psychopath. She kills everyone in sight with evident delight, and uses her body as a weapon (literally). For comparison, she makes Mona Demarkov in ""Romeo is Bleeding"" look like a nun! In true Bond fashion, ""GoldenEye"" traverses all across the globe, standing still mainly in Russia and Cuba. Russia never looked so intimidating (the scene with the statues is genuinely creepy), and Cuba never looked so good! The action sequences come at us one after the other (although there is plenty of time to further the story). Each one tops the next. The opening sequence is breathtaking, and all the action sequences get the adrenaline running very fast.James Bond would be nowhere without a dastardly villain trying to wreak havoc on the world. Of all the Bond movies I have seen, no one is more unforgettable than Alec Trevelyan (played by Sean Bean). If he doesn't creep you out, nothing will. This is Hannibal Lecter creepy. His cool, almost soft demeanor belies his cunning mind. Alec Trevelyan will chill you to the bone!Even if you're not a Bond fanatic, don't dare miss this one!",GoldenEye
125,Maniac-9,Brosnan saved the Bond franchise,9,22 February 2012,"After what was a bad turn of Bond's after Sean Connery gave up the role with lackluster performances by Roger Moore, George Lazenby and Timothy Dalton it didn't look like the Bond 007 series would go on much longer. There was a 6 year gap between License to Kill and GoldenEye, which is an astronomically long period between Bond films. Pierce Brosnan was who they originally wanted to play Bond years earlier instead of Dalton anyways but his TV deal playing Remington Steele didn't allow for him to take the role. But I guess things were meant to be this way since he may been stuck in a bad script like Dalton had for his first Bond film in The Living Daylights. I would rank the Bonds as 1. Connery, 2. Brosnan, 3. Craig(still could jump higher with more time in the role).",GoldenEye

If the objective is to kill Bond, then why send an unarmed female? It's the stupidest plot-device ever, and needless to say, they end up lip-locked.Another plot-hole is when Bond has the chance to kill the main bad-guy in the movie, yet he doesn't... he literally has a fully loaded AK47 in his hands and is face-to-face with him, yet he rather chooses to run out of the room instead. Makes zero sense.Overall it's an OK action film, but the fact that Bond literally refused to kill the bad-guy and let the bad-guy go triggered me so bad that I have to deduct points for that.",GoldenEye

128,nicholls_les,Brilliant Brosnan,9,23 November 2015,"GoldenEye is one of the best Bond film made in many, many years. Pierce Brosnan's debut as Bond is brilliant and I felt about time we had a real James Bond unlike the previous incarnations with the over comedic Roger Moore and the overly serious Timothy Daulton. Brosnan has the perfect attitude and character to play Bond. A mix of sophistication ( that Craig lacks) and a ruthlessness that makes the action believable. GoldenEye brings back Bond to what it should be, it is like an up to date Sean Connery with in my opinion an even better Bond in Brosnan.We have a deadly satellite weapon system falling into the wrong hands, and only Agent 007 can save the world. Yes Bond IS back at last!Bond races to Russia in search of the stolen access codes for ""Goldeneye,"" an awesome space weapon that can fire a devastating electromagnetic pulse toward Earth.

129,Horror-yo,Amazingly awful caricature of a Bond flick,3,20 July 2017,"Answer this: what merit is there in creating a cardboard-deep narrative with totally interchangeable components in every possible facet of the movie ? Like a cliché villain, cliché lines, cliché everything. The entire thing is a disposable piece of commercial rubbish that could've been made any two thousand or whatever other ways and landed exactly the same caliber.The intro scene is beyond risible, I really can't imagine anyone taking it seriously in any potential way. The theme song is horrendous.The entire film is almost literally 5 minutes of headache-enducing line delivery, then an explosion, then 5 minutes of dialog again, then an explosion. There are buildings exploding, there are people exploding, there are guns being fired full blast, there are trains catching fire (like, on the outside), there are tanks exploding, there are buildings collapsing... and then there's Famke Janssen's absolutely ridiculous role and pretty face, Pierce Brosnan's pseudo-smarty pants frown for about two hours straight...Amazingly, it's over two hours. Two hours of this.It got a good press at the time it came out, because mind you between the last of Dalton's Bond in the late 80's and this, 6 years went by without a Bond. Surely a record. But besides that fact of cinema, good Lord, this thing is a whole bunch of nothing.",GoldenEye
130,grendelkhan,A brilliant debut and a return to form.,8,3 December 2012,"After a long gap, Bond returned in Goldeneye and Pierce Brosnan finally got to play the role he was meant to play. Brosnan lost out on the role in Living Daylights when NBC, which had essentially canceled Remington Steele, decided they were going to hold him to his contract, after the attention Brosnan received as the next Bond. The series limped along with a few more episodes then was canceled for good. meanwhile, Timothy Dalton took over as Bond. While his first outing was great, apart from a weak villain and shaky middle section; his second outing was a very mixed bag. Ensuing legal issues and various rejected scripts kept the series in limbo. Dalton moved on and Brosnan finally got his chance.The film sets the tone right away, putting Brosnan in some Connery-era situations, as we take a trip into the past, with Bond and 006 infiltrating a Soviet nerve gas factory. Things smash right along and Brosnan proves he was meant to be Bond. next, we move back to the present, where we are introduced to a new generation of assassins in Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp (a very Flemingesque name). We also get Alan Cumming as a Russian computer expert, in a memorable character part. And we meet our love interest. Well, two out of three ain't bad. Along the way, we are introduced to new supporting characters, all filled with outstanding actors, including Judi Dench as the new M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Colin Salmon, Robbie Coltrane, Tcheky Karyo, and Sean Bean as 006 and out villain. By this point, Bean had made a name for himself in the Sharpe series and in Patriot Games and he is well suited as a turncoat 00. This adds a nice touch to the series, as we always wondered about Bond going up against an equal. meanwhile, we have a real global threat, something missing from the series for quite a while. We even get the return of Joe Don Bake, in a more suitable role. Everything is firing here.The stunts are great here, with the tank chase through the city a memorable set piece, as well as our teaser scenes and our climactic battle. We get plenty of exotic scenery, including Russia. The characters are good and the plot chugs right along. This is a Bond film in the classic mold, while updating things for a new generation. Tina Turner gives us a memorable theme song, and we have titles that harken back to Maurice Binder, if even more sexually charged. With everything working, it becomes a shame that this is Brosnan's highpoint, as his series would begin to suffer from the problems that plagued late era Moore and Dalton Bonds (convoluted plots, weak villains, committee scripts). This is one to savor, though.",GoldenEye

Judi Dench brings us a wonderful M who feels very strict and feels like a female version of Bernard Lee.The villains are also interesting with some wonderful Russian accents. Sean Bean although doesn't look the part of a Bond villain, really fits the part for this movie as he looks very much like an ex-spy. Famke Jannsen gives us a very interesting character that feels different to the franchise.The action as always is very impressive with the tank chase in st.

136,jhaggardjr,Terrific Bond movie,9,14 May 2000,"After a six year hiatus, the James Bond franchise made a triumphant return with ""Goldeneye"", the 17th Bond film (that does not include Sean Connery's 1983 non-Albert Broccoli produced Bond film ""Never Say Never Again""). After Timothy Dalton decided not to return as 007 after two films, Pierce Brosnan took over the role that he originally won in 1986 after Roger Moore retired from the role. But due to his contract dispute with his '80s TV series ""Remington Steele"", Brosnan lost the part and Dalton was hired. After the so-so box office response to Dalton's first Bond film ""The Living Daylights"" and the disappointing box office performance of his second film ""Licence to Kill"", Dalton quit the role and the series went in limbo. Then after a couple of years, Brosnan got the role of 007 right back and in 1995 his first Bond film ""Goldeneye"" was released. This is a terrific Bond film. It's much better than Dalton's two Bond films. It has good action scenes, sexy women, and a nice sense of humor. ""Goldeneye"" also features the series debuts of Dame Judi Dench as ""M"", and Samantha Bond as ""Miss Moneypenny"". Desmond Llewelyn returns as gadgetmeister ""Q"", the only holdover from the old days of 007. Sean Bean and Famke Janssen are the villains, Izabella Scorupco is the love interest, and Joe Don Baker (who played a villain in ""The Living Daylights"") is the assistant and sidekick. All the actors do a good job in the movie. But the standout performance comes from Famke Janssen as the villainess Xenia Onatopp. She's one of the best female villains the Bond series has ever had. Since this movie she has gone on to appear in many more movies (including ""The Faculty"", and this summer's upcoming ""X-Men"".) This movie went on to become the highest grossing Bond movie in franchise history, and it brought the series back from near death. I'm glad.

137,dfle3,Has the greatest fight scene in the franchise to this point. 75/100,7,8 September 2010,"18th of 23 Bond movies (17th of 22 official Bond movies) Pierce Brosnan assumes the role of James Bond in this movie. There was a time when this really would have been exciting to me...i.e. when I was a fan of his action series ""Remington Steele"". However, by the time Brosnan did become available for the role, I think a lot of the excitement had ebbed away. It was his role in ""Remington Steele"" which did in fact prevent him from taking on the role as Bond for so long. As a much younger person at the time, it's also possible that Timothy Dalton's time in the role may have lessened my enjoyment of the franchise too. Having recently re-seen - or perhaps seen, in one instance - Dalton's movies again, I have to say that I appreciate him much better now, even though those comic book elements appeal to me less now.In the opening sequence Pierce comes across as a coiled spring action hero...veritably panther-like. However, with Pierce, he is like an ice-berg...the character is mostly beneath the surface. Whereas Roger Moore in the role was one for eye-brow raising, with Pierce he maintains a poker face...giving nothing away. Maybe that's not such a good thing. This movie does have moments where it plays things for laughs and we see Bond in a new light...as someone who revels in his extraordinary masculine abilities. Anyway...Exotic locations: The 'new' Russia (after the break up of the Soviet Union and the Cold War that came with it); The Caribbean...Puerto Rico.Plot: Takes place 9 years after the pre-title sequence. In the Space Weapons Control Centre in Russia, a rogue military group seizes control of GoldenEye, an armed Russian satellite in space which can send cities and countries back into the Stone Age.Franchise clichés: Pre-title sequence - Gun barrel sequence with techno type music playing. Pierce's Bond has a no nonsense approach and a narrow stance. Some of these sequences in the earliest Bond movies were quite fruity...e.g. Sean Connery's Bond did have some wobbly gaits and back legs in these movies.The PTS proper has Bond in Russia working to disarm a chemical weapons lab. He has the assistance of 006 - Alec Trevelyan - on the mission. Things don't go quite according to plan. The end of the sequence has one of the great action sequences in any Bond movie...it's right up there with the one for Moonraker...it's fantastic - in the literal sense. If you found the PTS in Moonraker unbelievable, well, this is Unbelievable...on stilts.Theme song - Tina Turner sings. Surprised that it was written by Bono and The Edge of rock band U2. It's a slow, Broadway show type tune. Nothing special...apart from the names involved. End credits seem to be getting more theme songs now too...here it's ""The experience of love"", sung by Eric Serra and written by Eric Serra and Rupert Hine. I think that this may be Hine's 2nd end theme song in the franchise. Interestingly, the end credits reveal Minnie Driver to be the singer of ""Stand by your man"" in the movie proper. The name rang a bell which is why I'm noting it here.Q - Played by the same actor - Desmond Llewelyn - unlike numerous other regulars who have been 'rebooted', so to speak. It's casting like this which makes taking the franchise as chronological and consistent impossible.M - The new guy is...a woman. Played by Judi Dench. This is the first Bond movie to recognise/acknowledge the dated attitudes of the franchise...at one point she says to Bond ""You're a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War"". Not exactly sure what she's getting at here! Moneypenny - Another reboot here. This is only the second time in a Bond movie where she is not a vacuous character. The first time was in the greatest Bond movie of them all, ""On her majesty's secret service"". On this level, it's the perfect follow up to that movie, as far as Moneypenny's minimal character 'arc' goes. Like M, she has some good meta-comments about their relationship.Silly female character names -They're back! Xenia Zirgauna Onatopp!Wine buffery - One of the few if not the first time Bond has uttered the phrase ""Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred"". Trivia: Bond tells the new M that the old M had cognac in his top drawer. New M prefers bourbon...she offers one to him and asks if he wants ice with it. Yes.Sexism/misogyny - Made no notes on this...like I said, there's a consciousness in this movie about this element of the franchise in the past. In other words, this element is being left behind in the 1960s.End teaser - ""James Bond will return"". No specific title given.Watch for: * Bond also speaks French. Is there nothing this man cannot do? * Bond plays baccarat...not sure how many card games Bond is proficient in to this point...or whether we've seen him play this game in earlier movies.* Jack Wade of the C.I.A is introduced. Presumably he plays the role that Felix Leiter did in previous movies. See ""Licence to kill"" for Leiter's last outing with Bond. Jack mentions Guantanamo Bay to Bond...this was filmed before that place had nasty connotations, due to US practices there.* a history lesson on the Lensk Cossacks and their relationship with Britain during World War 2. It's an unhappy one, which casts Britain in a poor light...perhaps a first for this franchise...Britain isn't squeaky clean.* Revelations on how Bond's family died (a climbing accident) and how 006's parents died.",GoldenEye

This time around, newcomer Izabella Scorupco and Famke Janssen (X-Men) are the ever beautiful and always infamous ""Bond girls"". It's been 6 years since the last Bond film, License to Kill, and I think it's been worth the wait.  Let's just hope that we wont have to wait that long between the next films.",GoldenEye
139,bsinc,Good,7,17 April 2002,"This movie gets better with each viewing. The opening scene is one of my personal favorites and is arguably the most memorable of all Bond opening scenes. Pierce Brosnan is a great new age Bond, although his next two Bond movie really blow and ""The world is not enough"" is probably the worst 007 movie ever. The downside to this movie is definitely the music which is really bad, a kind of early 80's crappy beat that really spoils the car chase in the early part of the movie. And don't get me started on that whole BMW thing. Are we supposed to watch a different BMW model in every upcoming Bond Movie? Looks like it. Cheap propaganda. Well, al least the women are gorgeous, especially Famke Janssen who played her character to the max. The villain was a disappointing and so was the ending. But altogether the movie is a nice step forward, actually it was the only step forward,because the next two sucked.Hope the 20th Bond adventure is at least as good as this one. 7/10",GoldenEye

I dont know why so many people liked this film, maybe because we had not seen a Bond film in almost 7 years.  I found this movie to be all style and no substance, like most action films these days.  The only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the beautiful Famke Janseen, who made the movie almost watchable.  I dont know, I guess I just dont enjoy 90's action movies.  ** out of *****.",GoldenEye
141,domino1003,"Thank you, Pierce!",9,9 July 2005,"The first James Bond film that I had ever seen in theaters was ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" I use to think that Roger Moore was cool.Then I noticed things.Moore's portrayal of 007 became laughable, a joke.Then he left, only to be replaced by Timothy Dalton, who turned Bond into a very cold individual.I became rather disappointed when the series seemed to have died, believing that it was completely gone.Then came Pierce Brosnan.My faith is now restored, thanks to ""GoldenEye,"" the first of the Brosnan 007 films.007 is sent on a mission by the new M (Judi Dench) to find out why a top-secret weapon known as ""GoldenEye was stolen and by whom. His mission leads him to Russia and to his supposedly dead friend (And fellow agent) Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean), who has stolen the device, which is capable of wiping out all electronic equipment. And Alec is going to use it on London.Sure, the old formula is still there: the villain(or villainies)with the interesting name and gimmick. In this case, you have Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), who has (literally)killer legs. And you have the Bond Girl. In this case, Natalya (Izabella Scorupco), who is the lone survivor of the GoldenEye theft (And in which you see Xenia REALLY enjoy her job as she's wiping out Natalya's team members). Q(Desmond Llewelyn)is giving Bond his new gadgets, telling him to bring them back (Which never happens), and Miss. Moneypenny (Now played by Samantha Bond), trading innuendos with Bond.But the difference is that even though the formula is still old, there's new life in it. Bond is suave, but he has human frailties as well: His friendship with Alec becomes a bit of a hindrance and he is at odds with the fact that he will have to kill him in order to save the world.It was nice that Mr. Brosnan brought 007 back to life, and to make Bond a human being.",GoldenEye
142,willcundallreview,Brosnan's first is firmly good,7,12 May 2014,"Rating-7/10Goldeneye is a Bond that see's Pierce Brosnan take the reigns, and my does he ride it well. With a great build up and a film that wasn't afraid to lack action to make the plot much more mysterious and good, Goldeneye really is one of the higher rated Bonds in the entire series. It took off where Dalton left off with it's dark tones and a more realistic special agent, I felt that the film was a firmly good movie, and here is why.The story as said lacks maybe the whole action element we so often see with Bond although still manages to have big car chases and villains who are just plain evil to fill that hole. The plot intertwines together nicely and with some shocks we haven't seen the like of for quite a while In Bond, it really does make a good job of it all. One more good thing about this story Is that it makes it more of a drama here and doesn't just go full throttle with fighting and chases, some personal conversations take place.Brosnan in his first role does very well indeed to say this is the start, he has the charm of previous but also with a little side of skills in fighting and driving etc and this is what Bond is all about. The rest of the cast who I won't mention or it could ruin it for the reader of this are fine well on the villain side I mean, Judi Dench's debut as M is done well and she gives off a much more aggressive M than we have seen before meaning we know she will have much more major roles than M ever has.Martin Campbell directs very well and truly casts the blanket the past Bond directors have had with a firm piece that he manages to see through very well, I imagine he had a hand in coordinating the car chases. The script is stronger than usual and you actually focus possibly more on what they are saying for the first time in years as previous Bond's have occasionally had very weak dialogue. I loved the explosions, this movie has so many massive explosions and if you catch on early you will just think why are so many things blowing up, good fun though.As a criticism you could say this film lacks the thrills and action we usually see and instead just talks a lot and safely drops Brosnan in on the role, I disagree but I would understand if someone said that. They don't do away with the ridiculous stunts we so often see, fun to see happening but to some watching it could hit a nerve that you thought had gone away when Moore left the role. Not much else wrong, a bit of a mixed story really but it works out well in the end.Bond fans should really like this and I wouldn't b surprised if this were there favourite or in the top 10 because this is what Bond is all about and actually is a good special agent. For those who aren't such big fans of Bond well you may like it too as it contains all the elements that an action movie needs and brings them all to the forefront making for fun action which also seems serious enough.Overall I give this a 7/10, it is Firmly a Good movie and although not near to being Very Good, it is also much better than just being Kind of Good. Many people will tell you to savour this if your watching Bond in order because Brosnan never quite lived up to this again, I could agree but Goldeneye is one to savour as one of the better Bonds around, and to be fair it most probably is Brosnans best. Look out for the explosions as I said and enjoy them, this doesn't have a lot of humour but it's a great plot and makes for a good film.",GoldenEye
143,Cinemaniac1984,Pierce Brosnan strikes gold as he smoothly takes over the coveted role in one of the best movies in the James Bond series.,8,10 January 2021,"GoldenEye marked Pierce Brosnan's debut in his first outing as James Bond. Full of non-stop action packed excitement from start to finish, GoldenEye would be one of the biggest box office hits of 1995 and would resurrect the James Bond franchise after being in limbo for several years following a number of legal issues. It would also spell the end of Timothy Dalton's brief stint as James Bond following The Living Daylights (1987) and Licence to Kill (1989).When a powerful satellite electromagnetic weapons system known as ""GoldenEye"" is stolen, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is assigned to stop a Russian crime syndicate known as Janus from using the weapon. Initially thought to be spearheaded by corrupt Soviet General Ourumov (Gottfried John) and deadly assassin and henchwoman Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), the real mastermind is former 00 agent Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean) having faked his death while on an infiltration mission with Bond on a chemical weapons facility in Russia 9 years ago. Aided by Russian computer programmer Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), Bond must stop his former friend turned foe from using the satellite on London to cause a global financial disaster.Pierce Brosnan smoothly takes over the coveted role as James Bond from Timothy Dalton and he proves to be as memorable as his previous predecessors. Sean Bean was terrific as rogue 00 agent Alec Trevelyan. I really liked Izabella Scorupco as the newest Bond girl. Famke Janssen was great fun to watch as the crazed henchwoman Xenia Onatopp. Director Martin Campbell did an amazing job bringing James Bond back to life on the big screen.25 years on, GoldenEye is still an entertaining James Bond movie and certainly injected new life into the Bond franchise. Without a doubt, this was Pierce Brosnan's best Bond movie. And the Nintendo 64 game GoldenEye 007 based on the movie of the same name would become one of the biggest and best console games of all time.8/10",GoldenEye
144,majikstl,"""See him move through smoke and mirrors.""",8,30 November 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how GOLDENEYE rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: GOLDENEYE: Goldenfingereye. For Your Golden Eye Only. The GoldenSpy Who Loved me. Live and Let Golden-die. Or maybe it is just a reference to the producers' accountant. Whatever, it works. 7 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: Inexplicably James bungee jumps off a huge dam in order to break into a Russian installation on the top of a mountain. Then when making his escape he hops on a motorcycle and chases a runaway airplane off a cliff, where he skydives to catch up with the power-diving plane so he can climb aboard and fly to safety. Exciting, hilarious and totally unbelievable, Good stuff! 8 points.Opening Credits: With the passing of Maurice Binder, whose title sequences weren't always great, but nonetheless distinctive, the torch goes to Daniel Kleinman. Inspired by Binder's iconic work, but not imitative, Kleinman brings a fresh eye -- and CGI gimmicks -- to the project with great success. The fall of the Soviet empire is commemorated by a selection of barely-clad beauties taking sledgehammers to the fallen statues of Lenin and his ilk. Clever, stylish, sexy and most of all puckishly funny. 10 points.Theme Song: Other than alphabetically, one would not expect see the name Bono anywhere near Bond, but the U2 rocker and his partner The Edge have contributed a slinky, pounding tune that nicely accentuates Kleinman's wonderful title images. Unfortunately, they can't seem to lick the continuing problem with lyrics -- why is it that no one seems to be able to come up with a Bond song with catchy lyrics anymore? Even the distinctive voice of Tina Turner doesn't help. 7 point.""Bond, James Bond"": Certainly the best looking of all the Bonds, Pierce Brosnan makes his long-awaited debut as 007 and the results are pleasing, if not overwhelming. Falling somewhere between Roger Moore's broad comic strokes and Sean Connery's tongue-in-check sarcasm, Brosnan's low-key comic approach to the character is certainly a vast improvement over Timothy Dalton's sour-puss attitude. The change alone is worth 8 points.Bond Babes: The two new Bond Girls are an interesting picture of contrasts. Dressed in comfortable clothes and a frumpy sweater, Izabella Scorupco as Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova, a Russian computer programmer, has a girl-next-door wholesomeness, but proves quite resourceful in a pinch. On the other hand, Framke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp joins Fatima Blush and May Day as assassins who are as stylishly over the top as fashion plates as they are as killers. If Natalya is a symbol of Bond's new honest approach to women, Xenia is a welcome flashback to the day when the series reveled in excess. Add Samantha Bond's debut as the prim but sardonic Miss Moneypenny; Serena Gordon as Caroline, a Fergie-esquire bureaucrat; and Minnie Driver in a funny cameo and you have the best ensemble of Bond Girls ever. 10 points.Bond Villain: Two for the price of one: A traitorous Russian general teams with an equally traitorous British agent. Gottfried John is something of a cliché -- cold, stiff and humorless -- as the corrupt general. He is especially disappointing coming on the heels of Jeroen Krabbé's cheerfully duplicitous Russian general in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. Meanwhile, 007 wannabe Sean Bean is down graded a notch to become the evil 006. It is easy to he why he didn't make the Bondian grade, but he makes for an okay bad guy. 7 points.Bond Baddies: Before he became a ubiquitous fixture of 1990's film, television and theatre, Alan Cummings made an impact as ""invincible"" Boris Grishenko a computer geek with delusions of grandeur. He's proof that you don't have to go to comic book extremes to create a villain who is colorfully unforgettable. Never underestimate a nerd with a god complex. 8 points.Sinister Plot: The evil Russian and the evil Brit team up to harness the use of a secret Soviet satellite to rob a bank. Well, rob a bank, totally destroy England's power systems with a nuclear blast and cause total world economic chaos. Just another day at work. 8 points.Production values: The rather small stories of recent Bond adventures have been put aside in favor of the ""save the world"" mentality that made the series so popular in the first place. They even make a joke about it. Though Brosnan boasted about returning a sense of reality to the character and to the films, fortunately that was not the case and a larger-than-life sense of fun has returned. 8 points.Bonus Points: No doubt as a belated response to feminism, 007 gets a female boss in the form of Judi Dench as the new ""M"" -- though portraying the character as a dried up, petty, condescending old prune with a chip on her shoulder hardly makes some sort of bold feminist statement. They probably wanted to show that even a woman can be a tough boss, but instead the character becomes an ugly cliché of feminist as man-hating shrew. And it is a bit late in the game to try to establish Bond as an anti-establishment anti-hero by placing him at odds with his own government. Minus 5 points.Summary: Having lumbered through Timothy Dalton's two downbeat adventures, Bond comes back in style with a flashy, stylish and inventive adventure. And most of all, it restores a sense of fun to the series.Bond-o-meter Rating: 76 points out of 100.",GoldenEye
145,michaelarmer,Goldenshag,9,5 April 2020,"The 6 year wait because of legal action did this new release a world of good, they abandoned the too serious tones from the last 2, and the too many glib tones from Roger Moore's tenure, returning to the style of the originals with Sean Connery, serious with just a few glib remarks and sexual innuendo, and it worked, with Pierce Brosnan, who is a little similar to Connery in looks and more like the look of Bond than either Moore or Dalton, he really did look the part. With Brosnan, Irish, they managed to have Bond played by the four nations of the British Isles, Connery was Scottish, Moore - English and Dalton is Welsh (although English Heritage), with only Lazonby from elsewhere - Australia but with English Heritage. They also had an almost entirely new cast.The film was great, with several good actors who got too play characters, not just elements in the movie, it was well directed, great action, particularly the tank chase, the intro and on the observatory, many realistic items added to the quality, although some locations were not true, Switzerland was used for the Soviet intro and Puerto Rico for Cuba, but both places looked right anyway, the photography and scenery were very good, the music was good with a great title song sung by Tina Turner, however the end song was poor, some of the Russian dialogue was in English, it would have been better for them to speak Russian and add sub-titles for realism and Irina's singing was dubbed, Minnie Driver could sing so why not let her do it? Also all the Russian characters, although played well were played by other nationalities and Alan Cumming (Boris) did not look at all like a Russian.Bond Themes:- Casino scene, train scenes, Helicopters (modern ones), a new M played by a great Judi Dench, a new Moneypenny played by the appropriately named Samantha Bond and with more spirit, Q with the only continuing role by Desmond Llewelyn, no Felix Leiter, he had his legs chewed off by a shark in the last so the CIA character is now Jack Wade played well by Joe Don Baker (he was in the last as a baddie), the KGB is in it but no Walter Gotell as Gogol, no Festivals/Belly Dancer/Ski Scenes (although the intro had snow scenes)/Spectre or Cable Car, there were a few Gadgets though. Cars: - Aston Martin DB5, Ferrari Spider (both good), BMW Z3 (idiot/boy racer car - not good). Henchwoman:- no henchmen and continuing the theme of Hench Women is Xenia Onatopp played very well by Famke Janssen.
Bond Girls:- just 2 again, first up is Caroline the evaluating officer (no.53) played by Brit Serena Gordon, and then it's the main one Natalya Simonova (no. 54) played by Polish Actor Izabella Scorupco, neither are the most beautiful Bond Girls but not bad, Izabella just shades it for good looks. Some might count Xenia (Famke Janssen -Dutch, the most beautiful in the film) as a Bond Girl, she is one baddie woman who he didn't get to shag, they come close though, but the sexy fight scenes are not done in the name of attraction, just a bit of snogging leading up to trying to kill each other, so I don't count her.Despite a few inaccuracies, it is a great film, great acting, great action and well paced, the only reason I don't give it a 10 is because of the inaccuracies.",GoldenEye

The final fight between Bond and Alec is one of the best of the entire franchise. The film manages to be exciting and full of action, while not becoming too over the top or straying too far from the actual plot. That's the mistake they made with the rest of Brosnan's endeavor into the franchise. They made it all about the action. It's a shame that this is the only Brosnan that was any good, seeing as it's one of the five best of the franchise.

148,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,25 January 2005,"Brosnan's first outing as Bond is easily his best, but also one of the best of an actor yet. It has the perfect mix of humour and darkness, not overly serious like Dalton's films, not overly funny like Moore's. Not only is it a new Bond, but of course it is a new era, Cold War over, girl power starting etc. All of these themes are covered- we have a villain who simply wants revenge, while surrounded by the fading images of the Soviet Union, and several strong female characters who make Bond earn his money rather than simply making them do what he tells them to. M is dead-long live M- as Judi Dench takes over as Bond's boss, making sure he knows exactly who is in charge. Natalya, a computer programmer is feisty and capable of surviving many fights on her own, while Xenia Onotopp is like nothing Bond has faced before, and probably the best female Bond villain so far. No, definitely the best.Anyway, the story begins a few years in the past, with Bond and his fellow agent and friend Alec Trevelyn tackling the evil General Oromov in Russia. However, Trevelyn is killed and Oromov escapes, leaving Bond with another lost friend. Flash forward a few years, and Bond is investigating Oromov's whereabouts, and his involvement with a new uprising in Russia. Bond investigates, finding Natalya along the way, as her Satellite base was destroyed in a missile attack by Oromov and Onotopp, leaving her the only survivor. Bond hears that Oromov's boss wishes to meet with him, and in a shock revelation, we see that it is Trevelyn! He wants revenge for his family's treatment by Britian, as he was a Lienz Cossack. Bond is horrified. The race begins to stop Trevelyn as his new warhead becomes functional, and Bond has to decide whether he can kill his friend. 'For England James?' Trevelyn asks, leading Bond to question his part in Britain's game- he, like all the agents are after all, simply pawns, no matter what they might think or achieve.The chemistry between Bond and Bean is excellent, making Goldeneye one of the most emotional films to date. He genuinely seems to like Natalya, and the scene where she tells him he will always be alone is both stark and beautiful, and one of the best scenes in the Bond series. Oromov is a great villain also, and the audience hates him, Onotopp is so good we almost want her to kill Bond, and Alan Cummings as Boris adds some comic relief. In the game, everyone loves killing Boris. The song is OK, the revamped Bond theme is not as good as the original, but the incidental music is the best since You Only Live Twice.There are many memorable set pieces and stunts including the Dam jump, the plan jump, the Tank chase, and the final fight, and makes you wonder how Die another Day could have been so awful. The film is almost flawless, as the game was, and should be considered as one of the best films of the nineties. 9 out of 10.",GoldenEye

Along his mission, Bond receives help from the joyful CIA agent Jack Wade and the beautiful Severnaya operative Natalya Simonova(Izabella Scorupco). Throughout the movie Bond fights in a library and drives a tank through Moscow. The story for a Bond movie was solid and Goldeneye brought my favorite villain in Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean).

The code keys to a diabolical weapon called Goldeneye are stolen from the Russians. Bond travels to newly capitalist Russia to track down mysterious criminal mastermind Janus, an old foe with a particularly ambitious use in mind for the weapon.Brosnan's first outing as Bond made the world greet him as the second coming of Connery, and while a touch too flattering, this compliment is not entirely unfounded. Brosnan reaches a near-perfect balance of charm, humour and danger to be one of the better Bonds. In fact, the whole film benefits immensely from a serious artistic kick up the backside. The action stays physically believable (no sci-fi overreaching or Looney Toons stupidity) while remaining fun and wild in a uniquely James Bond manner, the girls aren't just pretty faces and become relevant to the plot and (gasp) memorable (Xenia Onatop is the craziest Bond girl ever put to film)...Tina Turner's hit title song might well be the best ever heard in the series, and Eric Serra (Léon, the 5th Element) gives the score a unique flavour. The villain is also interesting in a way that was surprisingly never previously developed in the franchise.Oddly enough, Goldeneye suffers sometimes from being a tad too knowing, even though this sometimes makes for sparking dialog (especially with new M, Judie Dench, a masterstroke of writing and casting).

155,mnpollio,Brosnan follows the trend of an underwhelming debut,4,2 April 2007,"There seems to an unspoken rule that, barring Connery, every subsequent Bond actor must have an underwhelming debut film. After a lengthy hiatus, Pierce Brosnan takes on the role (after an earlier near-casting) of 007. Ironically, many cite this film as the best of his run, but I find it both the stodgiest and the most unenthralling of his run.Bond: Brosnan has the right combination of polish and sophistication for the part, but his initial outing finds him downright stiff and uncharismatic. I am hard-pressed to remember him changing expressions for the duration of the film and he seems a bit uncomfortable with the role at this point.The villains: Sean Bean, who has made it a profitable sideline playing villains, is one of the more dull Bond villains. As a corrupt former double-0, the story tries to humanize him and provide him with a a bit of a back story. The end result is a forgettable, uncharismatic villain. Alan Cumming is merely irritating utilizing every nerdy cliché as a turn-coat Russian computer geek.The women: Izabella Scorupco is quite appealing and manages to carry her own subplot until the mid-point, at which time the screenwriters hook her up with Bond and promptly forget to give her anything further to do. Famke Jansen, an actress I normally enjoy, is dreadful here playing a murderous assassin who enjoys crushing her victims with her thighs during sex. Both her performance and the character are so over-the-top that they seem more suited to a Zucker Brothers parody than a straight action film. Watching her lick her lips lasciviously as she guns down whole roomfuls of people is ludicrous and she never seems much of an obstacle for Brosnan's Bond. Perhaps the reason why Jansen's performance sticks out like a sore thumb and seems so buffoonish is because the remainder of the film is so slow-moving and ponderous, nearly bereft of any humor whatsoever, that she seems to have walked in from another production. The action sequences are flat, the villains uninteresting and Bond seems a bit lifeless himself. The normally reliable Tina Turner contributes the second in a series of godawful ""wailing diva"" title tracks. Not the most auspicious beginning for Brosnan.",GoldenEye

He balances the gritty and humor of the character while making it his own. Judi dench in her first of 8 performances in the films, plays m as one who is tougher than the previous m while bringing a sense of balance and resistance toward 007 charms.

The plots were too confusing for a seven year old kid and they would always be boring and be the same thing every movie but I can't say that about this one.The film is about James Bond played by Pierce Brosnan who is on his latest mission: to retrieve back an American satellite from Soviet Russia. And thats basically all there is to it.The films story is confusing but Pierce Brosnan while not the best is still a great choice to play Bond(Daniel Craig in my opinion is the best) and the action is quite nice. But some of the characters are not very fun to watch like for example the love interest and the film is too long by a half hour.

159,dasa108,Bond's new decline,5,20 September 2021,"Barbara Broccoli begins her role as producer and interesting things happen: M is now a woman, Famke Janssen is a Russian assassin with an unlikely technique of deadly suffocation, and there is a whole spiel about M's leadership that could put Bond's poor life in trouble. With that, we can see that feminism got under its nose in a saga that was reeling until now the decline of the films began definitively. The exploits of the character are not credible without good Brosnan brings charisma to the matter, becoming the fourth best Bond after Connery, Lazemby and Moore (in that order).The movie is full of unlikely situations which detracts from the hero; villains can't be that idiotic, their shots can't be that bad, their motivations can't be cowardly. The film may perhaps be entertaining but it worries in multiple ways in its historical context.",GoldenEye
160,williampsamuel,Brosnon's Best Bond Offering,8,7 December 2014,"After six years of apprehension and uncertainty about the series' future, Goldeneye was everything fans had hoped for and come to expect. Larger than life villains, exotic locals, death defying stunts, and the world's most sophisticated spy. There was no doubt about it, Bond was back.Goldeneye begins with the best pre-title sequence of any bond film. Bond is joined by agent 006, Alec Trevalen (Sean Bean), in sabotaging a Soviet chemical weapons facility. Things go south fast, Trevalen is killed, and Bond makes his escape in one of the most astonishing action sequences ever filmed. Fast forward six years. The cold war is over, and the red menace vanquished. But the Soviets' demise has brought on a plethora of new threats. Agents of the mysterious Janus syndicate have hijacked the Russian Goldeneye satellite weapon, destroying its control center and killing all but one of the operations crew in the process. Bond must locate the massacre's lone survivor and unmask Janus before the weapon's power can be unleashed.I think we can all agree that the producers made the right choice in casting Pierce Bronson as the new Bond. He might not be the equal of Connery, but he is the most stylish man to ever play the role. Between his looks and his natural charm, it's understandable that his contract forbids him from wearing a tuxedo in any other movie. He's also suitably physical and handy with a gun.More brilliant than the choice of Bonds was the choice of villain. The real genius of this movie was to make to make Janus someone that Bond has had a long personal history with, someone he saw as a friend and mentor. When they meet, there's going to be a lot of bad blood, and those who haven't seen the film or played the video game will be surprised. And it's somewhat refreshing that the villain's big speech lays out not his plans, but his motivations.And Janus isn't working alone. His right hand man is the corrupt general Ouromov (Gottfried John), head of Russia's space weapons division, and the man who killed 006. There's also Boris Greshvinko (Alan Cumming), a brilliant hacker with the maturity of a fifth grader. But the most fearsome- and alluring- villain is Xenia Onatapp (Famke Jassen). She's combat trained, built like an Amazon, and takes great pleasure from every death she inflicts- especially using her own unique and especially brutal method, which I will allow to discover for yourself.This film's bond girl is Natalia Simonova (Izabella Scorupco). She's quite pretty, and what she lacks in toughness she makes up for in smarts and programming skills. But Bond doesn't meet her until halfway into the movie, and there are almost no scenes where the two of them are alone, so we never get to see their relationship develop.This movie is of course action driven, and there are several striking action sequences besides the opener. Both of Bond's encounters with Onatapp are suitably physical, and one of the film's high points comes when he chases Ouromov through downtown Saint Petersburg- in a tank! The effects, though usually recognizable as such, are quite good, and the bad guy's hideout is the most impressive since Moonraker. Goldeneye may not be without its flaws, but it's still a solid thriller, and one of my favorite Bond movies.",GoldenEye
161,stormhawk2021,Impressive debut of Pierce Brosnan; the third best movie of the series.,10,14 August 2018,"I could not wait for the appearance of the new James Bond. The Bond of the 90's. And it was only a matter of time before Pierce Brosnan took over the role of 007. Since the Irish actor was accompanying his wife Cassandra Harris to the filming of ""For Your Eyes Only"" (1981), and playing as a secret agent in the TV show ""Remington Steele"" (1982-1987); the idea of wearing the shoes of the British agent. Goldeneye only meets the appearance of the new 007.
The performances are adequate, especially Izabella Scorupco, who is Natalia, on of my favorite Bond girls; and Famke Janssen who is Xenia Onatopp, one of my favorite villains. Judi Dench, is very well in her role as head of the M16. The parliaments are not bad and leave us feeling a certain longing for the changing world, especially the Bond world. The landscapes are very beautiful and suitable for a James Bond movie, as well as the interiors.
The repeated custom of Ian Fleming to use the name related to gold, we see from ""Goldfinger"", like this, his house in Jamaica and from where he takes the name of the movie ""Goldeneye"", serves as inspiration to give a name to the adventure that gives us back to the mythical James Bond. In the movie, ""Goldeneye"" is the name of a satellite weapon.
When the boss of James Bond says in her face her truths to the agent, it seems like a funny scene. The jump from the top of the dam is impressive. When Bond and Onatopp fight in the sauna, it seems like a very sensual and well-worked scene to avoid censorship. The dialogue held by Alec Trevelyan with Bond, when the first is already head of the Russian mafia, I think it is very successful and if at that moment we see the face of Pierce Brosnan, we know that the new 007 has liked the masses.",GoldenEye
162,jonathanruano,Video Game fair -- Take a pass,4,11 September 2011,"""Goldeneye"" is not without its charms. There is a fantastic scene where James Bond (Pierce Brosnon) appears to jump off a cliff, land in a plane, and then fly off to safety. Then there is a humorous scene where Bond meets Russian mafioso Valentin Zukovsky (played by the great comic actor Robbie Coltrane).Yet the rest of the movie was surprisingly dull and witless. Pierce Brosnan lacks the physical presence and charisma to be Bond, even though he is an improvement over Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton. Secondly, ""Goldeneye"" fails at the screenplay stage. The 1990s, unfortunately, continued the trend of dumbing down James Bond films by replacing characters and dialogue with special effects, gun fire, explosions, and mindless chases. ""Goldeneye"" exemplifies this trend, because it features the explosion of the ""Goldeneye"" facility and then a helicopter, bad guys firing at James Bond and yet never appearing to hit their target, dull chases (involving Bond in a tank) through Moscow, and then more gun fights and explosions at the end. To the extent that there is a plot (one involving yet another plan to conquer the world), it merely serves as a clothes line to hang all of these action sequences and deny Pierce Brosnan's James Bond any screen time to show any personality, engage in a battle of wits with his adversary, or even charm women. Lastly, the villains are nothing special. Sean Bean probably would have done better playing James Bond than the villain Alex Trevelyan. As for Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp, she is a stock character. All in all, a big disappointment.4/10",GoldenEye
163,filmalamosa,when will they let you pick different outcomes,4,22 November 2012,Golden Eye was not bad for a Bond film. I rate movies relative to the pretensions of the work so lets give it 5 stars. All Bond movies for me are fun for about the first hour and terribly boring and anticlimactic during the final 20 minutes when the bad guy is routed by battling armies of scuba divers or whatever and the timer on the bomb stopped at 1 second. I guess I secretly like the bad guys! Gee I wonder how many people there are like me? Probably millions. It seems to me that the technology is already here where by you could have multiple endings to the same movienow there is a good idea. I could then select the ending where SPECTER wins.This Bond movie is good for the realistic props...the tank scene is too long. And the evil woman was too rough..I prefer them to use poisonous needles rather than slug it out physically,GoldenEye
164,TheHande,Brosnan's Best,9,2 December 2005,"Pierce Brosnan fits Golden Eye like glove. I guess that each Bond has their own thing and while Brosnan's were quite colorless the man definitely has the right qualities to play 007. I like just about everything in this film. The plot, the characters, the settings. I always find a reference to the Cold War adds a bizarre element of nostalgia, no matter when the movie was made.Action-scenes are excellent and fortunately not too repetitive.While Brosnan is not the ""dark Bond"" I like, he does seem to simultaneously carry qualities of Connery, Moore and Dalton. The soundtrack is also one of my favorites and though I am a little more than an occasional listener of Tina Turner I think the theme is one of her best works.",GoldenEye
165,shadowman123,"Oh yes , it was good .",8,9 January 2006,"Pierce Brosnan played Bond with so much style it was truly a pleasure watching him on screen . The whole plot of this new James Bond film was an excellent one as well which kept it glued to your seat considering that the USSR and issues with the cold war ended a while back ago . As I said the acting was to notch , Sean Bean was a really impressive almost psycho bad guy , FAMKE JANSEEN - WE GOT TO HANG OUT !!! Q was still as impressive as always . The film maintained a very good pace that required you to pay attention so I really had no reason to look the other way . The action sequences were like nothing that I have seen in a 007 movie , they reminded me of more like a Schwartznegger flick but still it was mixed in nicely and it worked really well , the car chases were also something to talk about I mean I could just stay here and talk about the opening car chase all day long and not to mention that action packed chase involving the tank . Pierce Brosnan also pulls out Bonds cheeky one-liners with style that it makes you laugh at the right moment . All in all , the only thing I can say is that Pierce Brosnan has made one hell of an impact with this newest Bond outing winning winning a whole wave of new fans ! Well done Pierce !!! what can i say apart from DIFFERENT STYLE , SAME BOND !! BROIS - YESSSS , I AM INVINCIBLE !!",GoldenEye
166,gareth-75442,"How do you parody a Bond movie? Simple, Just make another Bond movie",4,29 August 2020,"I have never been a fan of the goofy Bond movies, the majority of the stories/plots are just cringeworthy awful or plain stupid, upto & including the rebooted Bond with Daniel Craig, arguably the worst incarnation of Bond played by the least charismatic actor of the lot.
Goldeneye is as silly as any of the Bond movies but it does have some excellent actors & the crucial comedic Q scene but as with the typical bond movie it's littered with awful unfunny jokes & terrible double entendre, but what gives this film its extra cringe is the addition of Famke Janssen as an OTT psycho nymphomaniac killer, literally moaning with orgasmic delight with each kill.

Coming from an Alex Cross stare down fan, I'll take the leeway.In the casino, Onatopp smokes, and also lights her cigar as a non-demonstration: she should be smoking as a demonstration, but, alas, she doesn't, because she's being stared down at.This is perhaps where the word double-Cross gets its/their very own Bond.",GoldenEye
169,general-melchett,"A good debut for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, but not perfect.",7,20 January 2007,"Goldeneye was a better Bond outing - the opening scenes of the film certainly deliver on the epic scale and action, even if the dialogue between Alec and Bond was dull at best and cr*p at worst. But who wasn't overwhelmed when Bond leaped off that dam? I sure was - it felt like one of those Sky adverts we get in cinemas nowadays. But despite the fact this film was a financial success, it is far from perfect. The script isn't great - certain scenes feel more important than the plot as a whole, and though the tank chase through the Russian city was good, it had no real use in the plot. Even though the film has a nice dark side and it is improved by a shocking revelation and betrayal, the plot is ultimately derived and the Goldeneye isn't exactly a very original idea. And the quality of the outer space shots of Earth wasn't hot. The film's most beautiful lady, Xenia Onatopp, was an interesting character but not a complex one - merely eye candy and nothing else. I may be an avid hater of romance in any form, but Elektra King's seductive torture of Bond in The World Is Not Enough was far more effective than Onatopp's constant grunting and groaning in dark settings. It makes for a laugh, but also a pointless femme fatale character. And the villains aren't great either. I hardly even knew who Colonel Ourumov was, and Boris must be one of the least menacing villains either - he defines the word ""geek"" in every way. His death may be interesting and his character is somewhat amusing, but he is no Bond villain. This film managed to bring Bond out of the Cold War well and proved that the ending of this long, hard conflict didn't mean the end for 007 - the action scenes are great and won't be feeling dated for years now. Bits of paper flying through the air in the indoor battle before the tank chase show great attention to detail which all films should strive for. And the stunts are also good. Abandoning cr*p CG for great real action is what makes the Bond films great - and Goldeneye is no exception. But it comes with its problems as well. 7/10",GoldenEye

But, of course, there's always the good old TV, and that is where i have seen almost all of the James Bond movies. So, to me, GoldenEye is a very special movie. It is the first modern Bond movie. All the other ones sucked compared to this one, i thought when i saw 4 years ago. You'd probably think i've become wiser now, and may be true, but GoldenEye is, in my eyes, still the best Bond movie. Although i agree Sean Connery makes for the best bond interpreter, none of his movies (this is MY opinion)can top this one. I had a great time watching this, and it is a movie anyone can enjoy. It is so full of action, humor and beautiful, it gives anything you'd wish for in a bond film. If you haven't seen it, you really should.",GoldenEye
171,Hancock_the_Superb,"""No - No - No more foreplay!"" - James Bond **spoilers**",8,9 January 2003,"This is the best of all of Pierce Brosnan's Bond installments, hands down - I know elsewhere I said ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", but after thinking it over I realized that this one had the edge in everything - plot, acting, believable characters, casting, and definitely humor - this is the only of Brosnan's films so far that's made me laugh out loud - and it did that many times.The plot? A mysterious explosion wipes out a supposedly shutdown Russian computer base in the middle of Siberia. 007 (Brosnan) is sent to investigate, and finds out that a cabal of ex-Soviet soldiers/agents, led by his old colleague 006 Alec Trevalyan (Sean Bean) (who Bond had left for dead in a mission nine years earlier), are planning to use a satellite-based weapon called GoldenEye to nuke London and numerous other major cities. It's up to Bond and the lone survivor of the missile-base, a second-level programmer named Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) to defeat Trevalyan and his minions.The casting and acting is arguably the greatest in any of Brosnan's Bond films, just edging out ""The World Is Not Enough"". Brosnan, of course, is great. Sean Bean, as the villain, was very good, and his portrayal of a betrayed man (and the secert from his childhood - but see the film) is superb. Pollack-Swede Scorupco is very good - she is not the most beautiful Bond girl ever (IMO), but she is still a relative rarity - she isn't a kickass sidekick a la Wai Lin or Jinx Johnson, but she's not a helpless bimbo either. Her Natalya is surprisingly realistic, and she gives a good portrayal. Famke Janssen, as Xenia Onatopp, one of Trevalyan's henchmen, is great - though I personally prefer Sophie Merceau's more layered performance in TWINE, the very sexy Janssen handles her role quite well. German character actor Gottfried John is another henchman of Trevalyan (and also a former nemesis of Bond), General Orumoff. John's performance is superb and subtly humorous (I like how, during the tank chase, he kept taking shots of whiskey while watching Bond's pursuit).The other actors are just as good. Robbie Coltraine as ex-KGB Agent and victim of Bond Valentin Zukovsky - save perhaps Rowan Atkinson, Coltraine is my favorite actor, and though he has only a bit role, he is still much funnier than in his extended role in TWINE. Alan Cumming, as yet another Trevalyan henchman, Natalya's friend Boris Grishenko, is hilarious (""I AM INVINCIBLE!"") and goes out in an indescribably funny way. Joe Don Baker, as CIA Agent Jack Wade, proves he can be a good actor when he wants to be - though he has only a comic bit part as well. The regular MI6 staff (including Judi Dench as the new M) appears, and Desmond Llewelyn (sp.?) has his only really funny scene in a Brosnan film (""Don't touch that - that's my lunch!""). Turkish actor Tchéky Karyo (""1492"", ""The Patriot"", ""Wing Commander"") is good in a cameo as the Russian defense minister.The action scenes are all well put together (though the St. Petersburg tank chase wasn't my favorite scene). For once, the humor is funny, though most of it goes to the supporting players (esp. Boris, Zukovski, and Wade). Special effects are very good, and the action scenes don't go too over-the-top.Eight stars for ""GoldenEye"".",GoldenEye

174,buzznzipp1995,"A new, exciting chapter, that makes 'Bond' History",10,12 September 2006,"Enter Pierce Brosnan. I was floored at what I thought this would be, verses what this played-out like on the big screen. From the first scene, this was a brand new and exquisite 007. A shining 'Freshman' in the chain, but, an experienced veteran to the screen. Brosnan was amazing! Even Connery was interviewed in regard to the newest entry of the 'Bonds'. He said he thought that Pierce did an outstanding job, he just thought that 'they' (the Production co.) should have let Tarrintino direct it. Whoa! Now there's a strange adventure waiting to happened. The 'Dam' scene that was in the beginning along with the breath-taking original soundtrack was a wider dimension than I had thought it would be. The 'THX' in the theater I saw this in, rocked!! My heart pounded. The pace was just what it should be, and the storyline was right on top. The entanglement of Bond however with the Russian Villianis, was a little different this time around however, she was quite a bit more on the controlling side of strength and power, than I can remember from the decades past...Brosnan to me has always been a winner, from the 'Remmington Steele' days to 'Detonator I' and 'II'. He always seems to bring a certain dignified respect and style to the roles he plays. This was no exception. From the Russian Satellite communications station to the beach, the scenery was wondrous. This Bond was a solid addition to the 'Broccoli' cereal. The new characters and the changing of the Mi-6 guard was interesting to me too. except for 'Q' good olé' Desmond, now late. I was, well not ready for the Judi Dench, 'M' but she turned it around from seeming like an irritated mother figure to a respectable boss. And what can you say about Sean Bean as the switch-over agent, he is a grand villain. Bravo to the cast and the director.The music the action, and the performances, were fresh and worth waiting for. After all I had been waiting for a good return to Bond. This, without a doubt, is one if not the most 'suave' James yet.I had heard some years back in the eighties that Brosnan was looking to come up for the role of 00, but that he was beat out. But I am glad he made it and it was the right story for him and the perfect timing. In addition they sold a ton of those new BMW two seater convertibles mainly due to this one. Funnier thing is, that as for the sophomore Bond, Tomorrow Never Dies was good fun and at times gritty action, then along came the third installment, The World is not enough, which for me was a little better than the preceding (1997) but then came, ""Die Another Day"" (2002) This had the cheesy- effects, and one of the lamest plots, after the first scenes of the film, were outstanding it quickly dropped, just like the Titanic setting sail. In closing for me, good Ole' ""GoldenEye"", is Brosnan's seminal straight-up action, spy-role Masterwork.I say, 'Good show'. Long live Bond, James Bond.",GoldenEye

177,David_Frames,All that glitters...,7,30 March 2005,"GoldenEye is a bit like kissing your beautiful teenage second cousin - exciting but you're not sure it was right and wonder if you'll be vilified in the future for enjoying it. The first and most important thing to say about Brosnan's debut and the first Bond in 6 years is that its the first Postmodern/Revisonist Bond adventure- that is to say its the first film in the series to consciously appropriate its predecessors for commercial reasons as opposed to the laziness of those behind the camera. This is very much a reflection of the time it was made because the 90's was officially the decade that it became impossible to enjoy anything without in jokes, self-referential asides and the spectre of a lot of tired eyes from winking at the audience ad nauseam. This is a clever way of doing something new without doing something new. Who needs original ideas when you can appropriate old ones with an enlightened sense of irony? With so many clever, media literate people out there we should be enjoying a Golden age for cinema and T.V but strangely this isn't the case. Could GoldenEye offer a clue as what's gone wrong? Timothy Dalton had taken the brave decision to take the character back to its literary roots but Bond's legions of fans didn't like it, not that many SAW it of course, after all when you bring back any popular character after a long absence the last people you worry about are the core fan base. They're great at telling you all the Bond girls in alphabetical order or which University Bond went to but there aren't enough of them to make box office gravy. For that Bond's producers had to appeal to a wide audience who would have a very general idea of how Bond should look and sound. These people keep Eon's producers in lunches so if they think that Bond films are about girls, guns and puns then that's what they'll get. Substance would be wasted on them and its with this idea firmly entrenched in the minds of all concerned that GoldenEye made it to the screen. Though it became tired thereafter one of the things the producers got right was the casting of Brosnan who manages to come across as relaxed (if a little smug) and gets to reel off some fairly descent one-liners. His presence certainly helps the thing move along engagingly as does the highly kinetic direction from Martin Campbell who certainly is a tonic coming after the point and click era of John Glen. Campbell imbues the film with energy and keeps the pace and the camera moving along nicely. The combination of good director and a lead throwing his all in push GoldenEye up a notch or two and almost papers over the cracks but there's a few rotten elements here which undo some of their good work. First and foremost the script: The whole Russian Mafia plot minus the cold war setting feels a little forced and any attempt to get under Bond's skin falls flat. Sean Bean's fallen 00 as lead villain is dreadful and spends the moving looking like he's sucking a boiled sweet while spouting lines that wouldn't have been out of place in the original Casino Royale. Also the budgetary constraints are highly conspicuous and a little embarrassing for all concerned. Bond's budgets had been eye wateringly tight for a little while and more money was pumped into this revival after Cameron's True Lies (1994) showed what was possible with the format in your injected it with a lot of hard cash. However, GoldenEye looks positively cheap in some places. Derek Meddings may have been a miniatures genius of old but his effects have always looked to me staggeringly unrealistic - like something I'd piece together using an old Hornby train set. In a big-budget action movie it jolts you out of the illusion completely leaving you with shots that look instantly dated. As a result GoldenEye has scenes that look as though they were shot in the Seventies. Not the kind of nostalgia they were looking for, though it was nice to see that a villains enormous industrial complex can still be destroyed by a pen and a bit of pipe. The budget limitations also mean that the film feels unfinished. You're introduced to Bond's new car and protocol suggests you'll see it in use at some stage but the promised set-piece never materialises. I've also never been able to get over the feeling that those gunships should have fired on the ship as they took off either. I'm not alone there surely? Then there's Eric Serra's score - a metallic sounding, electronic effort that I originally hated but now sounds refreshing offset against David Arnold's sub-Barry efforts. So on balance its a watchable entry in the series but the death knell for anybody who hoped that Brosnan's era would deepen and challenge the existing formula. GoldenEye had to be a hit and for that reason it was always going to be safe, well trodden territory. The inhibited approach characterises all of Brosnan's entries culminating in Die Another Day which is nothing more than a highlights package. GoldenEye at least isn't a complete waste of time but its not exactly Bond Mecca either.",GoldenEye

It isn't a pretty sight! I always wondered how Ronald Reagan could have been telling a story from a movie as though it had really happened. Now, I understand the process.I have to say that I really liked this movie quite a bit. I had just seen the latest Bond installment and it compares favorably. I had also forgotten that it had been 6 years between Dalton's last effort and Brosnan's first. You would think I would remember the first Brosnan movie since I have always liked him - even back to his TV days. And, as a Bond fan, you would think the first Brosnan Bond would be quite memorable. But, nooo. I can't blame the movie though.Everything you want in a Bond movie was here. Romance, suspense, action, stunts, danger. The villans were better than average, Brosnan is excellent, and it is always nice to see the battle take place between the west and east - even if the east is a renegade general.

However, with the release of this film, they showed that James Bond lives on forever. This movie was an outstanding way to modernize the Bond concept.This is the first Bond movie to star Pierce Brosnan in the role. Brosnan proves to be a very worthy James Bond. In a way, he kind of combines Connery's manliness with Moore's wit and charm and Dalton's grittiness. He also looks how most people would imagine Bond looks.Sean Bean great as Alec Trevelyan. He is one of the most charismatic Bond villains and probably the most personal, having been an old ally of 007. Boris, played by Alan Cumming, is also pretty entertaining, and I loved how he was put away, but I won't spoil it.This film has a lot of the qualities and staples of the old Bond films. The script is witty and the film still has a really nice look to it over 20 years after its release.The action scenes will give you the bang for your buck. The stunt sequences in the pre-credits are spectacular, but the true stand out in this film is the tank chase through the streets of St. Petersburg. It was pure mayhem, and it was simply awesome.Natalya is a pretty good Bond girl, and the theme song by Tina Turner is also really good.The film does have its flaws. I really didn't like Xenia Onatop. She was way too creepy for my tastes; she ranks alongside May Day in ""A View To A Kill."" The film also has some pacing issues here and there.This is bar far the best of the Pierce Brosnan films, even though the next two aren't bad at all.

180,Ibuk,Goldeneye-The only great Brosnan Bond,9,13 May 2008,"This Bond entry is very special for me because it was the first Bond movie I saw in the cinema. As many Bond fans know there was a six year hiatus between LTK and Goldeneye but it was well worth the wait. In a way the six year delay worked in its favour because Goldeneye comes across as one of the freshest Bond in the series. Brosnan took over the role of Bond from Dalton but he wasn't the only one to get replaced. Judi Dench took over the role of M and Samantha Bond was the new Moneypenny. Thankfully Q didn't get replaced and he's there to remind the audience that they are watching a Bond movie.The opening sequence, which is reminiscent of TSWLM was simply breathtaking. Sean Bean as Alex Trevalyn was pretty good, in fact one of the better recent Bond villains. The plot was good but the action scenes were remarkable, the tank sequence was outstanding.One interesting aspect of GE is the interaction between Moneypenny and Bond. In almost all the Bond movies Bond would enter M's office and the first thing he does is start flirting with Moneypenny. In Goldeneye when Bond tries flirting with her she playfully starts accusing Bond of sexual harassment. This shows that Bond movies are willing to support women's right because for the first time since Bond's debut in 62 it shows that Moneypenny is strong enough to reject Bond's flirtations. The times had changed since Bond's debut, in 1962 Women were generally housewives but by 95 trends had changed and women had well paid jobs and supporting themselves instead of relying on men to bring home the bacon. M also calls Bond a sexist mysogniist dinosour. It was a brave move for the Bond producers,it could have ended up alienating the fans but it worked in the producers favour. Gone are the days when Bond girls were shown as insecure dim women who would just jump into bed with Bond at the drop of a hat. The director of Goldeneye has recently revived the series with Casino Royale, which was nothing sort of brilliant.Goldeneye is a classic Bond and like CR will be fondly remembered for years and years to come.",GoldenEye
181,MrDeWinters,Good start,10,12 October 2021,Leaving the awful 80s behind this is a breath of fresh air. Pierce did a great job but his demeanor is more of a banker or lawyer. Otherwise it has a great pace and all ingredients of a good Bond. Shame about the title song. Tina hasn't got the range.,GoldenEye
182,extravaluejotter,"Welcome back, Mr Bond,,,",7,23 April 2006,"This was my re-introduction to the Bond film franchise and I've been to the cinema to see every one since Pierce Brosnan took on the 007 role.Brosnan has real screen presence, important for a role in a movie that is basically a reprise of those before it. The last Bond, Timothy Dalton, is a fine actor but his Bond was a humourless automaton compared to Brosnan's. The Brosnan Bond has a twinkle in his eye and the definite feeling that the only time he's not enjoying the ride is when he really thinks he's going to die (or have to make a commitment to one of his many female conquests.)""Goldeneye"" ticks all the Bond Boxes. The girls, guns and gadgets are all there, along with a creditably megalomaniacal villain (Sean Bean's creepy Alec Trevelyan/Janus.) There are also some well-cast supporting roles for Judi Dench as the redoubtable ""M"", Joe Don Baker as CIA liaison Jack Wade (Felix Leiter having had his legs chewed off in ""Licence to Kill"") and Robbie Coltrane as Russian gangster Valentin Zukovsky. Alan Cumming also deserves a mention for almost but not quite acting everyone else off the screen as Boris Grishenko. His role as the uber-geek evil genius is one of his finest.You can complain that the plot is formulaic and riddled with inconsistencies, but that's the same for all Bond films. Before ""Jaws"" came along, the Bond films were what we now refer to as Summer Blockbusters. We knew what we were going to get with a Bond film and the studio rarely tinkered with 007's trusty format. ""Goldeneye"" harks back to the Connery Era, with a Flemingesque storyline and a charismatic actor as our favourite super-spy. Welcome back Mr Bond!",GoldenEye
183,TheFilmGuy1,Classic Bond,8,15 September 2014,"I really do love Goldeneye. Perhaps it's because Pierce Brosnan was the first person to play Bond that I saw in theaters? Maybe it's because of the awesome N64 game that I played as a kid? Whatever the reason, I find Goldeneye to be a lot of fun.Pierce Brosnan really does play Bond well. He has that charm and swagger and over all badass-ness that Bond should have. He becomes Bond. Izabella Scorupco plays Natalya, the Bond girl, who I think really is gorgeous in this movie. She's got that exotic Russian girl thing going on. Even Famke Janssen who plays Xenia Onatopp does a great job playing a very evil and very weird villain. She seems to be sexually aroused by violence... but trust me, that's not a complaint. There are lots of other great performances, such as Sean Bean as the main bad guy, and even a bunch of other smaller characters do a great job. The cast is full of interesting characters. The movie really blends that mix of drama, action and humour that I think the Bond movies do so well. It can be extremely cheesy at times and may require you to really suspend your belief when it comes to certain things, such as the dive to grab the plane, or the fact that the thugs cant seem to hit Bond when he is five feet away. Regardless, it's a fun popcorn flick and a memorable Bond movie that really showed just how awesome Brosnan was in the role.",GoldenEye
184,C22Man,Ready to save the world again,8,20 July 2015,"Bond Review. Title: A Bond title always sounds good when gold is involved.Pre-Titles: Bond and fellow agent Alec Trevelyan infiltrate a Soviet chemical facility to plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is apparently killed, but Bond manages to escape as the place blows up. This is a fantastic opening, throwing us straight into some intense action and it has Bond at his physical best. The famous dam bungee- jump is spectacular and Bond's escape where he free falls after a plane is ridiculous but extremely enjoyable.Theme Song: Tina Turner croons through a decent theme. It's nothing out of the ordinary and Turner's vocals are a little dull, but it is a nice call back to Shirley Bassey's themes and the bombastic arrangement carries it well.Plot: A deadly satellite weapon named the 'Goldeneye' is stolen and Bond is sent to Russia to locate it. Bond soon learns that the organisation behind the theft is fronted by his former ally Trevelyan who has sinister plans for the Goldeneye. This is a great plot with a smart and rather unique twist as we see Bond battling against somebody from his past. Trevelyan's scheme is suitably extravagant for a Bond villain, while there is plenty of action and character driven scenes throughout. The film is extremely successful at blending its grounded tone with some classic excessive moments.James Bond: Pierce Brosnan makes an assured debut as Bond. Dalton's tough edge is missed, but Brosnan is extremely charming and delivers his lines perfectly. He also looks just as you would imagine Bond to. I'd say this is his best performance in the role, his Bond seems most humane here and he handles the action well.Bond Girls: Izabella Scorupco is excellent as computer expert Natalya. She pretty much has the perfect balance as she is sweet and vulnerable, but tough and fully able to hold her own. She is just a really likable presence and has great chemistry with Brosnan. Villains: Sean Bean is superb as Trevelyan. As said it's great to see a villain who knows Bond and Bean is effectively the evil side of the character. He's the perfect physical opponent as Bean is subtly charismatic in the role and has an intense presence. Famke Janssen is also wonderful as Xenia. She's incredibly attractive, has the characters seductive nature down perfectly and is involved in plenty of the action. Not to mention using her thighs as a killing method. Gottfried John is very good as treacherous Soviet Ourumov. He uses his expressive face and intimidating presence tremendously.Support: Judi Dench is brilliant in her debut as M. She retains the characters no-nonsense approach and has some enjoyable lines, but has a more understanding side. Joe Don Baker brings some humour as CIA operative Jack Wade and Robbie Coltrane is good fun as Russian mobster Zukovsky.Action: The action here is outstanding with some great set-pieces. The car chase with Xenia in Monte Carlo is great fun, the stealing of the Goldeneye is intense and we get to see Brosnan bang a few heads together with is always great. The tank chase around Moscow is an incredibly entertaining set-piece. The climax is brilliant and builds the tension well. The fight between Bond and Trevelyan is truly superb, it is extremely rough and looks like a fight to the death should. The action doesn't shy away from the more vicious aspects and its blends the tough with the fun terrifically.Score: Eric Serra provides the series most experimental score. It's very synth heavy and has a lot of ambient arrangements, but it is unique and fits in seamlessly. Many of the compositions are memorable and they do create tension well, whilst there are some really soothing slower pieces.Production Values: Martin Campbell does a solid directing job. He knows how to make dialogue seem important and his grounded style always keeps the film focused. The cinematography is impressive, it looks a lot slicker without completely losing its grittier side either. For the most part the dialogue is pretty good too. Most of the lines and conversations do sound realistic, but when lines come along that are suitably big or exaggerated they don't feel out of place. The editing is solid as the film slows and quickens at exactly the right points, though it does slow a little too much before the climax. The lack of gadgets and downplayed one-liners might disappoint some, but this was a clear attempt to make Bond more real and it works fine here. The sets are great, especially with the cradle in the climax, and there's some great miniature work too. The locations are excellent as usual, with an interesting look post-Cold War Russia and the tropics of Cuba used well. Conclusion: GoldenEye was a fantastic return for Bond after 6 years in the cold. It is easily one of the best balanced films of the series, it is a serious film with plenty of serious moments but it never forgets to have fun or to give the audience some pure entertainment. Pierce Brosnan makes a confident debut, Sean Bean is a very memorable villain, both the female leads are great, the score is interesting and the action is absolutely stunning. The writing and visual stylings are both on form here too, whilst it gives you time to get wrapped up in the tension or to simply enjoy what's on screen. GoldenEye is very much a classic Bond film with a smart modern twist.",GoldenEye
185,riggo-73503,The worse bond on record,2,23 August 2020,"Brosnan out done by bean... his acting is as convincing as his singing
Mama mia its bad",GoldenEye
186,bushtony,"GoldenEye - Hollow Praise, Hollow Movie",1,8 May 2009,"In a telling scene in Goldeneye, Judy Dench (M) accuses Brosnan (Bond) thus: ""You're a sexist, misogynist dinosaur - a relic of the cold war."" Excellent lines, barbed, insulting; great scene, accentuating the fact that despite his background, Bond is a timeless, transcendent character. Most of the rest of the film doesn't live up to the sentiments, the edge, the focus and quality of it, sadly. It's almost like an intrusion from another, better, more creatively realised movie (The Third Man, for instance, from which it cribs some of its' plot). This, along with the haunting night-time meeting in a ""graveyard"" for monuments of Soviet Russian icons (a smartly allegorical instance) are perhaps the only truly inspired facets of this film.There is a sort of fragmented schizophrenic quality about GE that relates to tone, content and pacing. From the outset, with the breathtaking bungee jump off the dam, a real stunt by a real guy that manages to be both visually exciting and believable, my first impression was – if they're going to stick with this sort of approach; we're in for something special.Next, we meet the new James Bond, complete with floppy bouffant hair, hanging upside down in a toilet stall whilst a Russian guard has a bowel action. ""Sorry, forgot to knock,"" quips Bond - before cold cocking the defecating Soviet. What? Sorry, forgot to knock? How lame is that? What an awful, misplaced, miscalculated line. It's void and meaningless, ineffectual and completely lacking any sort of wit or contextual relevance. Now suddenly we're in sub-par Roger Moore territory. Even something like: ""Just dropped in,"" would have at least referenced how Bond got there in the first place. Radio Station Bond suddenly tuned out here, signal lost.Then, for a while, we're back on track with Bond meeting up with 006 and the planting of the bombs, Trevelyan's convincing ""execution"" by Orumov and Bond's escape. Great – a return to action- thriller mode once more.Only, instead of Bond making it to the plane on the motorbike at the last instant, wrestling for control as it slips over the edge of the cliff and flying triumphantly away, what happens? Bond has to fall over the cliff after the plane has fallen before him, skydive to catch it up – defying the laws of physics – and then fly away. What for, exactly, and why did they do this? It ruined what could have been a perfectly good conclusion to the PCS. It's as if they just had to add that bit of complete stupidity, as though driven by some irresistible instinct, unable to help themselves. Additionally, has anyone ever noticed that the Russian chemical facility is at the base of a dam and that both are supposed to be situated on a very high mountain where it's possibly a trifle unusual to find a massive dam? And when you see the mountain base from above, where's the dam suddenly gone? Any ideas?As for Brosnan, a prize cheese if ever, he cosmetically smarmed and smirked through the movie with the clumsy over-confidence of an actor who thinks he's extending his range, when he's really showing off his limitations against the backdrop of a more skilled supporting cast who unfortunately looked like they were outshining him even when underplaying. He should always be steered clear of real actors - for his own sake. And was it just my imagination, but didn't I see his right eyebrow strain to rise in an instinctive Moore homage a few times? I'm pretty sure about this.The scene on the beach is jarring, horribly manufactured. The Broz doesn't do emoting in any way convincingly and should never be encouraged to try. Robert Mitchum's advice for non-actors of ""Just walk around and try not to bump into the furniture"" is the level he's pitched and stranded at. All that staring off into the middle distance whilst the breeze tickles the bouffant is truly embarrassing. Campbell's attempts at injecting ""real"" drama into this sometimes ill-rendered hack-cartoon reality fails to gel, adding to the episodic feel of the film and further to a lack of singular vision.The pacing in GE feels all wrong - it speeds up, slows down, speeds up, like a Ford Cortina with the clutch burning out. And although some of the set-pieces are impressive, it doesn't seem to be able to sustain optimum thrust for long, as others seem painfully dragged out. Not helping in the least is the score which, it has to be said, is a truly dreadful thing of epic proportions. The worst and most offensive example takes place when Bond has a car race with Onatop. What were they thinking? Was it purposely intended for use in screenings only for the deaf? Those notes meant to signify car horns are crushingly ugly and horribly grating. A musical travesty capable of inducing suicidal inclinations in hyenas and hypomanics.What never ceases to puzzle and amuse on a personal level is when this film is rated highly by Bond ""fans."" Ultimately, it provides little more than a flashy, over-hyped, vapid, MTV-influenced pot-pourri of greatest hits moments which don't add up to a satisfying whole. It's like one of those mediocre compilation albums where you simply flick through to the songs you like, enjoying the few good bits, and arbitrarily disregarding the rest. Fleeting surface flash and gloss with no real heart or soul. A hollow Bond movie garnering hollow praise.",GoldenEye

Pierce Brosnan was perfect for it, and an excellent story, and the villains were okay. I like that Boris guy a lot, especially his famous line ""I'm invincible!"" I'll never forget that! This movie is everything you would expect in a Bond movie, the gadgets that are hi-tech and kept discreetly, the prologue with Bond shooting, a smooth soundtrack, fast cars, a lot of guns, and the women who are all over Bond. And Bond is as shrewed and suave, Pierce did a very good job! This proves that a very old franchise and series can live on and catch up to today, and attract a whole new audience.

In some ways, it had all the makings of a trademark James Bond movie, but it started to lose me after awhile. For one thing, it got PC on us and made M a woman. I found that a little hard to take. She seemed too much like someone with an ax to grind. She had no sense of humor at all, and her hair was so tight, I could hear her brain screaming.Another way this movie strained credibility was the tank chase scene in Moscow. I could be wrong, but I don't think Russian tanks can go eighty miles an hour. Dad and I both thought that was a little ridiculous. There were a lot of good chase scenes that are typical Bond fare, but I think they started to slip with this one. 6 out of 10.",GoldenEye
191,Zoooma,"Out with the 2-timer, in with the new guy!",8,5 June 2014,"A 007 makeover. A bunch of greatness in this movie but some not so good. It was 6 years between Bond movies, the longest break ever, and by far. Gone is Timothy Dalton who brought a real and flawed and emotional James Bond to the screen, a darker Bond. In is Roger Moore style action in the form of one Mr. Steele, Remington Steele... errr, I mean Pierce Brosnan. The stunts are great, most of them, but comic, too, such as freefalling to the side of a nosediving airplane. Give me a break! But we do have a return to action and that's a wonderful thing for the thrill seeking Bond viewer. Unfortunately, we have lame music and a lame opening Gun Barrel sequence. The main song, written by Bono and The Edge, is great, but where's the Bond Theme throughout the film? Yes, music can help make a movie and here it helps break it. Ugh. Terrible! But overall I am impressed. Brosnan is going to take some time to get used to. He's the third Bond in four films but he might do. We shall see! Oh, and interestingly to me, this is the first James Bond film (chronologically) that I never previously saw. For the life of me, I cannot remember seeing any of it ever so this was the first time. I know I've seen clips and I have seen other Brosnan 007 movies, but never this one. In any case, it's not amazing but still great and so very welcomed.

193,rjsf96,Brosnan Stays Onatopp of Things,9,29 October 2015,"Six years. That's the time it took for Bond to find a way back onto the big screen. After 1989, Bond had hit a dead end. Fast forward to 1995 and Pierce Brosnan was the new face of 007 with enough charm to give Sean Connery a run for his money.After a less than successful mission was accomplished by 007 in 1986 on a Soviet base; Bond is tasked with retrieving the Goldeneye weapon, which when activated causes an electromagnetic pulse destroying all electrical equipment in its nearby vicinity. Bond must destroy it before it sets England back to the Stone Age. Although when 007 comes face to face with the ghosts of his past, this becomes a far more personal mission than previously thought.Martin Campbell is one of a couple of Directors to actually bring substance and style to the series. Not just for Goldeneye but Casino Royale as well. Bond has personal enemies to confront this time. One of the best. Sean Bean as the long thought dead 006 agent Alec Trevelyan. He attacks Bond on not just a physical but psychological level. It makes their encounters all the more gut wrenching and palpable. There is even Russian General Ourumov a relic of the Cold War days. He manages to outdo all of the usual clichés and that's because his character is more than a Russian accent. He will carry out his ways by any means necessary, with or without the help of his own people.There is a tech savvy Bond girl Natasha Simonova who chastises 007 with ease ""Well don't just stand there get us out of here"". She is also much smarter than she lets on and actually plays a part in the action that takes place on a regular basis. The femme fatale Xenia Onatopp is frighteningly fearsome and frisky. Bond finally meets a woman that is almost a match for him and her method of dispatch could not be any more gruesome than it already is; leading Bond to quip ""She always did enjoy a good squeeze"". All of which culminates in one of the best climaxes in a Bond film; atop a huge satellite dish holding onto for dear life, whilst fighting against the twisted 006.Goldeneye effectively went back to basics for Bond. The approach needless to say paid off. Martin Campbell delivers an astonishing Bond entry that this witty, smart, sexy and tense practically non- stop. When it comes to Bond nobody does it better than Campbell.",GoldenEye

195,stp43,The Best Of The Brosnan Bonds,8,23 November 2002,"Goldeneye returned James Bond to film theaters after a six-year hiatus, and Pierce Brosnan takes over the role of the world's most famous secret agent. Brosnan successfully combines the suaveness of Sean Connery with the hard-nosed cynicism of Timothy Dalton.Officially this is the first post-Cold War Bond film (and the first to be shot in Russia itself), but in reality it is the second, with Dalton's License To Kill being the true first such.  Though the Cold War is over, the risks from it are still in existence, as the Russian mafia jockeys for position to control as much as it can.  Bond must tail an ex-Red Air Force jet jockey, Xenia Onatopp, who is having a torrid affair with the test pilot of a new high-technology gunship - an affair that proves deadly and which leads to an even bigger threat to the West.  The new head of Her Majesty's Secret Service is an obtuse bean-counter, and neither she nor the ticked-off HMSS bureaucrats she commands get along well, but at least she is willing to send Bond to correct a mistake she has made, the mistake in underestimating the importance of the chopper theft.It leads to James' encounter with an old friend, and one of the few instances in the entire Bond series of a truly gripping encounter with what turns out to be an adversary.  That it is so effective can be put to the strength of Sean Bean's performance as well as that of Brosnan. 
The inevitable fireworks erupt, beginning with the destruction of the gunship and a terrific firefight in a Red Army base, before James tracks down his power-mad adversary and learns the full extent of his plan for vengeance.",GoldenEye
196,TankGuy,"""Walther PPK 7.65 mm, Only Three Men I Know Use Such A Gun, I Believe I've Killed Two Of Them""",8,3 April 2016,"During the Cold War James Bond 007 and Alec Trevelyan 006 infiltrate a Soviet chemical weapons facility. However as the detonators are set to destroy the facility, alarms sound and Trevelyan is killed by Soviet troops as Bond narrowly escapes with the entire complex exploding. Nine years pass and the Cold War has ended, although MI6 learns that a devastating satellite weapon known as the GoldenEye has fallen into the hands of a notorious crime syndicate known as Janus. 007 is sent to St. Petersburg to investigate and to his horror discovers not only that his old compatriot Alec Trevelyan is very much alive and the chief of Janus, but has stolen the codes of the GoldenEye and now controls it. Bond learns that the vengeful Trevelyan aims to use the GoldenEye to fire a destructive electromagnetic pulse at the UK, thus allowing him to hack into every bank account in the country and erase any trace of theft...GoldenEye heralded a new beginning for the Bond franchise. The original creative team was almost entirely replaced and the producers began pushing the franchise in the direction of the modern action flick. With the culmination of the Cold War the world began advancing rapidly in terms of technology and various political ideologies would be completely changed. It was with things like these that the Bond movies would have to compete, therefore the series underwent a serious rejuvenation as the filmmakers sought a fresher approach. Timothy Dalton resigned from the franchise after playing Bond only twice as legal disputes threatened to kill the series. However setbacks were professionally overcome and GoldenEye was released after a bleak six year gap, this time with Pierce Brosnan in the role of agent 007. GoldenEye really was a spectacular comeback for the franchise, although I think that the 80s Bond movies are among the best in the entire series!. The Pierce Brosnan era is my least favourite(I always have and always will prefer the pre 1990s ""classic"" era)but GoldenEye is by far Brosnan's greatest. His second and third outings were fun, but lacked the elements which made the older Bond movies so great and his fourth was just downright awful. Exploding with rollicking action sequences and boasting some terrific dialogue, GoldenEye gets off to a cracking start with an enthralling shootout and chase which ends with an extremely impressive motorcycle cliff-dive!. It also has some of the craziest stunts of the series and the bodycount is higher than that of your average Bond movie. Then we have an anarchic shoot-em-up in a Russian military archive directly followed by an awesomely chaotic pursuit which sees Bond hijacking a Russian tank and wreaking destruction on the streets of St. Petersburg!. The exhilarating chase and fistfight between Bond and Trevelyan which precedes their taut confrontation atop a huge satellite antenna was just as spectacular!. This was the first Bond movie to use CGI which is fortunately kept to a bearable minimum. The other realistic special effects, such as the fiery destruction of Trevelyan's armoured train as well as the aforementioned satellite antenna, look amazing!.Whilst Pierce Brosnan is decent in the role of 007, Timothy Dalton is greatly missed here and I would have much preferred to see him return to the role a third time. I thought he was fantastic in the previous two films(especially Licence To kill)and the dark premise of GoldenEye was much better suited to him rather than Brosnan. Game Of Thrones' Sean Bean made for a superbly jaded Alec Trevelyan and the gorgeous Famke Janssen was also brilliant as the sex-loving, thrill-seeking assassin Xenia Onatopp. Eric Serra's score was decent enough, but he's no John Barry.An immensely fun actioner with riotous proportions of chaos on show. 8/10",GoldenEye

198,darin-wissbaum,Bond....James Super Human Bond!!,3,28 July 2009,"Have you ever gone to the movies and no more than 10 minutes in the film you realized this film is going to suck? Well, with me that film was Golden Eye. As I have said before in other film reviews there needs to be some sense of realism in a movie (unless you are watching a cartoon)for me to accept it. Well, no more than 10 minutes in this film Bond (played by Peirce Brosnan)is trying to escape from a mountain stronghold and is fighting to get to a plane that is going down the runway to take off. Bond manages to fight off his attacker and go for the plane. At this point I was expecting him to climb into the plane and fly it off the mountain, which would have made sense. Well, instead the plane goes off the mountain and Bond goes after it. It is now in a zero dive with no one in the cockpit heading to the bottom of the canyon. But wait!! Bond dives after it and catches it, then manages to climb in and take the controls and pull the plane out of that zero dive and fly it away. Here are the problems with realism: 1) He could never have caught that plane being it weighed more, and it would have fell away much faster.2) once in a zero dive there would have been no way he could have pulled it out of the dive and level it out and fly it away.Talk about showing a contempt for the audience. What were the film makers thinking? I know its James Bond but its not suppose to be Super Man. I miss the days of Roger Moore and Sean Connery as Bond where they did things that where a little hard to believe (but was not out of the realm of possibility)but it was fun. I am done with Bond.",GoldenEye
199,eamon-hennedy,Great Debut for Brosnan.,8,10 November 2003,"Pierce Brosnan's first Bond film is huge success succeeding as both a great Bond film and a great spy thriller about the world after the Cold War. As first films go, Brosnan has an ease and a level of security here that works very well. You would never know watching it that this was his first Bond film, he is fantastic. It helps, though, that he is corresponded with a great supporting cast and a fantastic script that, despite a huge plot hole, works very well.The best part of the script is seeing how Bond is now interacting with the world now that not only the Cold War is over,  but that the world has gone and become a more politically correct one. His interaction with a modern Moneypenny a female M (who refers to him as a sexist misogynistic dinosaur) are all wonderfully done, but it is the more familiar Bond elements that make this the must see that it is. The far fetched plot, insane villain and two beautiful Bond girls all ensure a classic entrance for Brosnan and a brilliant reintroduction for the character.The plot is also quite strong as Bond deals with the death of a friend, only to learn that he has been betrayed. It all leads to a fantastic moment where 006, played with great aplomb by Sean Bean, is revealed to be the actual villain, having faked his death in the pre-title sequence. The scene features some wonderful music by Eric Serra and a wonderful scene where he reveals to Bond why he has done what he has done. The fantastic performances from Bean and Brosnan ensure that the film has a wonderful dynamic for hero and villain to play against. Trevelyn is not just another super villain looking to destroy the world, although that is something he is wanting to do, of course, but the fact that Bond is fighting against a man he believed to be his friend gives the film a mighty emotional punch, especially in the final moments that mark it out as something else. Add to this wonderful elements the shape of two beautiful Bond girls in the shape of Izabella Scoropco as Natalya Seminova and (my personal favorite) Famke Janssen as Xenia Onattop and some fantastic action sequences, such as the tank chase through St Petersburg and we have an all time classic Bond film, the beginning of a new era and one to rival the Connery dynasty.",GoldenEye

Dalton carried the mantle for 9 years through two mediocre films and was done.Enter Peirce Brosnan... one more time. This time, though, Brosnan was the man.Not to say Goldeneye didn't present some growing pains, as it was originally written for a grittier Dalton type Bond to play... it kicked off the Brosnan era no questions asked.Ultimately, it would be Cubby Broccoli's final production at the helm, but he got the 007 he wanted and left the franchise secure for those who he'd selected to carry on.Though not the best Brosnan Bond vehicle, it was an excellent start, and served as the blueprint for the sequels which set the franchise off like a rocket for the next decade.Gadgets guns and girls, Brosnan helped return James Bond to the relic Judy Dench's new M accused him of being; just plain cool.",GoldenEye
202,charlessmith702210,"Basically, a stolen EMP space weapon goes into the wrong hands and Bond needs to stop it",9,8 February 2014,"One of the things I did not like about the flick was the opening car chase scene that may have nothing to do with GoldenEye, and Bond inside a Russian military depot trying to find something related to GoldenEye before he makes his very bold escape. But when the space station scene at Severnaya, Russia, happens, we are introduced to a new way of creating nuclear war. Not by heat blasts, thermal winds, or radioactive fallout. The new threat was realized in another movie called ""The Day After"", where a first simulated nuclear blast was an airburst that set off an EMP pulse wave. Car engines die, lights go off, LED displays go black. In short, an EMP used as a weapon can knock out anything run by electricity. So in ""GoldenEye"", this title refers to an EMP space weapon that, when fired, threads the needle in about a 10-20km radius...a surgical EMP strike that cripples and knocks out all electricity from everything like computers and televisions and similar devices. 2 such weapons already appeared in space for the simulated test firing on the space station, and the one that was fired was called Petya (the other was Misha). So, a space station general and Xenia enter the station, arms the weapon to target Severnaya, and then Xenia surprisingly shoots and kills 15-20 station facility members. One member who was alive after being shot did press the panic button just before being shot dead by Xenia. Then they make their escape out of the space station by their chopper before the EMP weapon fires, and steals the GoldenEye. 2 fighter jets were scrambled as well as a Tiger battle helicopter to the space weapons site, but they were no match for the GoldenEye's EMP when the strike hit. The jets and the chopper all went down and crashed due to the pulse. Natalya, who works at the station, was the lone survivor who was able to evade the mass killing but could only watch the first-hand damage to the station when the space weapon was fired and she could not stop it. The other part of the movie I liked was the army tank chase across the streets of St. Petersburg. You never seen such chases like that in most movies. I was able to see Bond overwhelm several Russian squad cars with the brute size and strength of the tank. Then, the final scene, where a secret plan to use GoldenEye in Cuba was launched, reveals the character Natalya at her best. Even though she was a 2nd-level programmer, she was able to change the access code to the Misha EMP space weapon, so that it re-enters the atmosphere to burn up over the Atlantic so the weapon is no longer a threat to the world anymore. How can she do that when her enemies who was about to kill her and James Bond tried so hard to make sure that GoldenEye would be shot over London and bring London totally out of business...but regrettably, could not do it?",GoldenEye
203,freewillyfan,Goldeneye,8,2 November 2019,Goldeneye is the first Pierce Brosnan bind film and in my opinion his only great one. Brosnan is really good in the role and the villain in this is great and has a really good motivation. The henchwoman was good but some of her scenes I thought were a little weird. The Bond girl was pretty good. It had a really good plot and the action was amazing. I really loved the tank scene and the opening was great. In my opinion one of the best Bond films.8.5/10,GoldenEye
204,TimBoHannon,"Brosnan helps resurrect Bond in an ""A"" effort",9,13 August 2004,"Much had changed for James Bond since Sean Connery first took the role in 1962. The series had taken a turn for the worse in the seventies, when five films were made but zero good ones were. Still, the public was willing to grant Bond limitless amnesty that decade, even as his escapades grew less and less exciting and more and more campy with each new film. The 70s came and went, ushering in the 80s, which kicked off well with 1981's ""For Your Eyes Only."" However, it went all downhill from there as the public finally stopped tolerating the bad movies and his popularity tanked in favor of superior competition. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger became mega stars during that time, and the emergence Indiana Jones was making Bond look dull and decrepit by comparison. Tim Burton's summer sweep of the cinemas with ""Batman"" in 1989 exacerbated Bond's woes, and when legal disputes arose between the production company and the studio shortly thereafter, it appeared that Bond had finally died his horrible but well deserved death.When the legal issues were finally put to rest in 1994, it was announced that another Bond film was going to be made, but not with erstwhile incumbent Timothy Dalton. Pierce Brosnan was given the role after being forced to reject it in the late eighties, and production began. The success of the film was crucial. If it lacked spark or came across as campy, it was likely that Bond would be finished forever. With the stakes in mind, the Broccoli family (the Bond producers) hired an all-new creative team and set to work re-establishing 007 in a new era.I knew none of that when I first saw the film in 1999. It was my introduction to the world of James Bond, and was a truly an exceptional first handshake. Knowing what I know now, and seeing the Bond films I have seen now, I still find it as worthwhile as I did then, and I am forever thankful that it was made well enough to not only resuscitate Bond, but propel him into the nineties with the momentum of a blazing fastball.The film opens in the eighties, ironically, with a scene depicting the Bond and Agent 006, real name Alec Trevelyan, being detected inside a Soviet chemical weapons factory. This section also introduces the character of Ourumov (Gottfried John), who murders Alec seemingly on a whim.Nine years later, Bond meets an appealing young lady (Famke Janssen) while driving...make that playfully racing, near Monte Carlo. Suspicious, he follows her to a nearby casino where he finds out that her name is Xenia Onatopp and she carries ties to the Janus crime syndicate in St. Petersburg. He chases Xenia when he suspects an imminent crime, but is not in time to avert her theft of the Tiger--a helicopter that is hardened to all forms of electronic interference.Back at MI-6 headquarters, the Tiger is spotted via satellite at Russian satellite control facility, and it soon becomes obvious that the copter is merely part of a grander scheme to steal a scary satellite weapon called GoldenEye. What it does can be described with words, but not with as much clarity as seeing it in the movie (there are lapses in the visuals here, but the sight is so impressive that they hardly matter). Bond then departs for St. Petersburg to find the Janus head man (Sean Bean) and stop him from using GoldenEye on a more vulnerable target. Much mystery surrounds the identity of Janus, but it is in the trailer and I suspect most people know it by now.There are several reasons that ""GoldenEye"" is the best Bond film made in many, many years. The first is the tone, which has ushered out all of the giddy goofiness of Roger Moore's films and assumed one reminiscent of the earliest Bond films. The sets, the camera work and the dialogue all come across as subtle, subconscious reminders of why Bond became so beloved to begin with.I always felt there were two major problems with the Bonds of the seventies and eighties. The first is the inane tone (exception: ""For Your Eyes Only,""), a point I am driving into the ground. With the same exception, they also featured uniformly unexciting (read it: bad) action plus horrendous acting. There are light moments in ""GoldenEye,"" as there should be, but the correct tone is never compromised. The only problem is that there is a little too much padding in the middle. The story is well told, although there is a meeting with Bond and Valentin Zukovsky (reprised by Robbie Coltrane in ""The World is Not Enough"") that has no significance to the advancement of the story. It is unnecessary and causes the film to drag some. After Bond meets Janus, though, prepare for the film to take off, as there will be little rest from there on out.Just like in the early Bonds, the acting transcends the genre. Pierce Brosnan is the clear focal point, and is mostly successful. He seems too reserved at times, as if he is a little timid at acting his best for fear it might look bad. He does not lack charm, though, because there is something about Pierce that makes him the ultimate ladies man on screen and off.
More successful is Sean Bean as James's opponent. Bean brings cold, subtle intensity to the role that shows off the acting skills that got him cast in ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" General Ourumov, who is in bed with Janus, provides a second bad guy. Gottfried John portrays him as a demonstrative brute, and his style provides a fine foil to Bean's controlled anger. Alan Cumming plays an evil computer nerd who provides most the light moments I referred to earlier. Fellow X-Man Famke Janssen's character is downright demented, and will not be forgotten easily.My friends, I have just explained why ""GoldenEye"" is a most superior Bond film that brought Agent 007 back from the dead and won over a new generation of fans. The best way I can think of to conclude this review is to comment on the film's conclusion. At one point it involves a brawl between Bond and Janus (who is referred to by his real name by that time) that buries just about every other one in the series. While it does quite not take the gold from the fistfight that opens ""Thunderball,"" is does serve as a final reminder that Bond is indeed back, and that he is once again a force best not ignored.",GoldenEye
205,MadReviewer,"Brosnan Makes A Great Bond, But . . .",7,10 July 2001,"Dmitri Mishkin: ""How shall we kill you?""  Bond: ""What - no small talk? No chit-chat? That's the problem with the world these days - no one takes the time to conduct the proper sinister interrogation.""This exchange in `Goldeneye' probably best sums up the Pierce Brosnan era of 007  this isn't your father's 007 anymore.  Sure, `Goldeneye' features a lot of the obligatory trappings of every James Bond movie made since 1963's `Goldfinger': elaborate chase scenes, gadgets, a bad girl with a name laced with sexual innuendo, and a megalomaniacal villain obsessed with taking over the world.  However, there's also a new attempt to bring 007 into the modern world.  As played by Pierce Brosnan, James Bond is still the cold, calculating, womanizing spy he's always been, but the arrogance has been tempered with a bit of self-awareness . . . and even a little remorse. Brosnan is also the first Bond to even slightly recognize how absurd some of the situations he's involved in really are  hey, he couldn't chastise the villain for failing to reveal his grandiose plan for world domination if he didn't recognize this. Brosnan's Bond is a more adult, somber hero than his predecessors  while this makes for a more well-rounded, three dimensional, believable character, it's debatable as to whether or not this makes for better Bond.  More on that in a second.But as for the film `Goldeneye'  pretty darn good, if not great.  Wisely avoiding the `Thunderball' template that so many Bond films seem to blindly follow (submarines and nuclear missiles), `Goldeneye' instead starts with a vacationing James Bond (Brosnan), who meets the lovely but deadly Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen, in one of the best Bond `bad girl' performances of all time).  Xenia is part of a Russian mafia team trying to steal an experimental helicopter that is insulated against all forms of electronic jamming  Bond, of course, tries to stop her, but not before getting a little frisky with her first.  Xenia succeeds, leading Bond to investigate why she would want to steal that specific helicopter  and he uncovers a plot involving the space satellite `Goldeneye', capable of unleashing electromagnetic pulses that can completely disrupt all electronic transmissions and functions anywhere in the world.  Xenia is just part of a larger plan, one involving some rogue Russian military officers  and a rogue, evil ex-British Secret Service agent, 006 (Sean Bean).  Whoever controls the Goldeneye satellite can conceivably control the world, so once again, it's up to James Bond to save the world . . .The action contained in `Goldeneye' is admittedly spectacular.  (In fact, the action sequences of all the Brosnan Bond movies are impressive.)  The opening sequence involving a free-fall off a perilously high cliff without a parachute is simply awesome, and later segments get the adrenaline racing as well.  The story is also pretty darn good  while not exactly Shakespeare, it covers all the standard Bond elements fairly well. There's a lot of razor-sharp dialogue between the characters, the plot is fairly original, the story crackles along at a good pace, and the ludicrous plot holes are kept to a bare minimum.  The main (and only) gripe with both the story and the action . . . well, it just doesn't have the feel of a 007 film.  Take out Pierce Brosnan and the references to the British Secret Service, insert Bruce Willis, and `Goldeneye' could be a generic action film.  There's small touches missing from both action and story that keep `Goldeneye' from having the true feel of a Bond film  it's missing things like the hilarious golfing scene from `Goldfinger', or the final confrontation of `Man With the Golden Gun'.  It's not a major gripe, but `Goldeneye' is simply too generic, as if someone took a standard action screenplay, inserted a few names like 007, M, and Q, and thought that was enough to make a classic Bond movie. It's enough to make a pretty good Bond movie, I guess, but the formula falls short of being great  or being a classic.As for the cast  first rate, for the most part.  As mentioned before, Famke Janssen practically steals the film as Xenia Onatopp, a sadomasochistic sex kitten from hell.  Equal parts camp and vicious brutality, Janssen makes Xenia one of the most memorable Bond characters in quite a long time.  The `good girl' of the film  Natalya Simonova (played by Izabella Scorupco) is excellent as well  while not exactly believable as one of the world's best computer programmers, she shows enough charm, wit and style to be more than simple arm candy for 007.  Sean Bean is pretty good as the rogue agent 006, but the character is so quiet and deadly serious that he almost fades into the background at times.  A little more over-the-top outrage would've made 006 a better Bond villain.  Special mention must be made of Desmond Llewelyn, who never, ever disappointed as Q, and Dame Judi Dench as the `new' M . . . it's definitely a guilty pleasure to see an actress of her esteemed caliber slumming in a Bond flick and loving every minute of it. And Pierce Brosnan  well, he's one of the best Bonds ever (second only to Sean Connery).  Debonair, cold, and confident, Brosnan effortlessly exudes a lot of the qualities that make 007 great . . . and have been missing for quite a while.  The only issue I have with Brosnan as Bond is the change towards the introspective, fallible, `21st century' Bond  but that's not Brosnan's fault.  Still, part of the `charm' of 007 is his complete ruthlessness (and if don't think Bond is ruthless, watch the first few Sean Connery 007 films again), and the introduction of self-introspection and doubt takes away from the established character.  Change can be good at times, but this one isn't.  A minor quibble, to be sure . . . but it's there nonetheless, and it's held Brosnan back from possibly being the best 007 of all time.Overall, `Goldeneye' is a quality film that's packed with action and is also a lot of fun.  If you're a die-hard Bond fan (like myself), you'll probably walk away from it a wee bit disappointed, but for the most part, it's still undeniably entertaining.  One of the better Bond films, and to date, possibly Pierce Brosnan's best Bond film.  Grade: B+",GoldenEye
206,cartesianthought,A strong intro for Brosnan in a Bond formula done well.,7,22 December 2015,"Goldeneye modernizes the series, between the self-deprecating dialogue about Bond being a Cold War relic, the inclusion of memorable women characters. Brosnan is the perfect Bond. He's handsome like Connery, charming like Moore and a killer like Dalton. It's full of action and the industrial score adds a dark vibe.In some ways progressive, it's dated in others. The plot is the same as most other Bond movies: Bond meets people, discovers an egomaniac millionaire, gets kidnapped, escapes, discovers an evil lair and stops a giant laser that will doom humanity. I wish there were more twists.But within the formula it manages to have hilarious henchmen like Boris and Xenia, Natalya Simonova as a Bond woman with dept and character, as well as Sean Bean playing a really good villain. Overall, one of the better modern Bond films.",GoldenEye
207,because-of-him,Not at all believable...,1,5 January 2016,"The beginning is very good and typical of Bond movies. After the credits, the movie degrades quickly. There is a gratuitous porn scene shortly after Bond meets a Russian woman. The woman is shown on top of a man and she makes all the orgasm sounds while bopping up and down as he lay on his back. And, not just for a couple of seconds. Then, the movie degrades even further when the scene turns to Russia at a secret lab where not only do all the Russians speak accented English, but their computer images are all in English, their passwords are in English, their wall maps are all in English. For a movie to be good, it has to mimic reality. Had this movie used the Russian language with English sub-titles (and left out the porn), it would have been very good.

209,Pelrad,Dench has Bond walking out with his tail between his legs :-),8,30 March 1999,"Along with the Star Trek films series, Bond films are ones that I look forward to. I saw Goldeneye when it came out in the cinema and had mixed feelings because I couldn't stand Pierce B. at the time (after seeing him in Mrs. Doubtfire and interviewed). But after getting used to him in seeing him in more films, I decided he wasn't such a bad action hero, so I rented Goldeneye again.Before expressing my general feelings about the film, here's what I didn't like:Many of the films these days make use of quirky comedy - not only in the dialogue but in the characters and some people love them and some don't. For example, the Chris Tucker drag queen dj in ""The Fifth Element"" - I never laughed so much in a movie. But others couldn't stand him. Or, when Data acquired his emotions chip in ""Generations"" some people couldn't stand his humour, while I had a blast with it. But in ""Goldeneye"", I finally found myself on the ""disliking the clown character side"" - I absolutely couldn't stand the Boris character.I also didn't like the fight at the end of the film. I hate it when all the great special effects are used up and the final scene of a film is a fist fight between the hero and the villain - it is so anti-climactic.A third element I disliked was the stealing of a group of lines from ""Die Hard"". Bond insults the villain by telling him that he's nothing but a common thief - this was stolen from the film ""Die Hard"" when John McClaine's wife says the same thing to ""Hans Gruber"".I wish that Russians would stop being portrayed as the villains in just about every movie, as if they were inherently evil. Why don't the British do something with other countries, like the U.S. or China or something?Finally, I was turned off by some of the escapes that Bond made. After seeing ""Austin Powers"" in which Dr. Evil has the argument with his son about killing Powers, I have developed a bad taste for easy escapes. (""Why don't I just bump him off with right now, dad? You can't set up an elaborate trap for him, you know he'll just escape."" / ""Nonsense, son."")Well, even after all those criticisms, I liked ""Goldeneye"" a lot; in fact, I thought it was one of the better Bond films. Lots of non-stop action. I also loved the introduction of Judi Dench as ""M"" and the scene where Bond walks out of her office with his tail between his legs. The female Russian villain was great too. (8 out of 10 - Good)",GoldenEye

213,Theflyace,Bonth Month #17: Pierce Brosnan's Debut is Amazing,9,22 October 2013,"GodlenEye was touted in 1995 as the most modern Bond to date. Yes it most certainly was in that year! GoldenEye dealt with something that plagued the Bond producers, is Bond still relevant in today's world. GoldenEye is the answer to this question, and offers a fantastic debut to the Bond I grew up with, Pierce Brosnan.The story involves the theft of the GoldenEye satellite disk, which can destroy a target electronically with an EMP device, by a crime ring known as Janus. The Sovet Union has fallen by now, so the new M (played by brilliant Judi Dench) warns Bond ""the sexist, misogynist dinosaur relic from the Cold War"" to keeps his wits about him and not let prejudices and habits affect anything. Bond discovers that the villain is former 006 agent Alec Trevalyan, who wishes to destroy England and all their government lies (oh and seize their money too) Pierce Brosnan was the Bond I grew up with, and the one I actually find to be my favorite one (well next to Sean and Daniel) He is a better looking Bond than all of the rest and he has just the right amount of humor and seriousness to convey the character. He is also very calm and collected, but can get primal when he needs to.Bond finally gains the first Bond girl since Tracy in OHMSS who actually helps him in the best way possible. Natalya Simonova is the best Bond girl of the 90s. She starts out as a nerdy computer technical but eventually becomes a sexy bombshell who is still smart and helpful to James.The villain is good in Alec, but the most memorable of the film is Xenia Onatopp (hahahaha the name hahahahahah) played by the luscious Famke Janssen. She is also twisted by the fact that she is turned on by the death of people and violence. very memorable indeed.The whole movie deals with the new age of Bond and also gives way to new stunts and action scenes. Bond drives a tank through the streets of Russia after a general. AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! The rest of the action is amazing, and seems more logical than most. I really have to give credit to director Martin Campbell, who truly understood what made Bond work, but also updating it to fit his standards as well as the modern cinema-goers of the 90s.

Taking the role of the other three great actors (I do not count George Lazenby) Brosnan makes a good and modern action movie, pre-matrix, very typical and right to the face. Not taking any stupid acrobatic fights, but fights with fists and kicks, chase sequences with Tanks VS Cars, Statues and Buildings, and sexy women (Famke Janssen, that's a woman!) The way of shooting and presenting the movie to the new audience (between 13 and 25) is very well done, but the plot is not a masterpiece, really. Looks like there is another evil satellite menacing the world, this time freezing clocks and provoking malfunctions on electronic devices. The writer didn't get bold for that plot, really. Exciting parts? The Tank scene of course, and that meeting between the not so dead friend of the past, and the hero.

216,sanddragon939,"James Bond steps out of the Cold war, but not out of the Cold...",9,6 July 2009,"James Bond, the legendary fictional spy created by Ian Flemming in the 1950's was essentially a product of the Cold War. International intrigue, plots and counter-plots by the rival superpowers and their allies were as often the subject of 007's missions as the generic megalomaniacs with designs for world domination. Bond came from an era where morality was loose and accountability even looser when it came to the planning and execution of clandestine activities in the name of 'queen and country', where agents were freely permitted to kill and/or destroy if it would further the 'cause'.It is therefore no surprise that with the end of the Cold War in the early 1990's, nearly four decades after 007 sprang to life on the printed page (and three decades before his even more grandiose debut on the big screen), questions regarding the characters relevance in the new era of relative peace in Europe and the wider world inevitably sprang up. Nevertheless, Barbara Brocolli resolved to end the speculations in 1995 by continuing the 'family business' and bringing the legendary spy back to life. And hence, Pierce Brosnan was chosen to play 'Ian Flemmings James Bond 007' in 'Goldeneye'.The film begins like any Cold War-era Bond adventure (indeed because it begins in the midst of the Cold War). Bond and his fellow agent, Alec Trevelyan, 006, infiltrate a Soviet weapons facility for the purpose of destroying it, their motive as always-'for England'. Unfortunately for them, the mission goes horribly wrong, when Alec is killed by Colonel Ouromov. Bond succeeds in destroying the base and barely escapes with his life. After a visually spectacular opening credits sequence (symbollically depicting the fall of the Soviet Union) the film flashes forward by nine years, to the post-Cold War world of the mid 1990's. James Bond's world has clearly changed drastically in many regards. MI6 has a new chief, the 'Evil Queen of Numbers' who has assumed the mantle of M, who clearly does not accord Bond the same level of professional respect her predecessor did, instead considering him as merely a 'sexist, misogynist, dinosaur...a relic of the Cold War' (a view many critics of Bond in the real world had been upholding at the time). As a consequence of the new regime, Bond's trained instincts after years of active field work are largely ignored by 'statistical analysis'. Miss Moneypenny is no longer the passive creature of bygone years but an actively assertive feminist. Bond's counterparts in the CIA sneer at his seemingly childish adherence to 'secret codes' and protocols. Russia is no longer the enemy, it is now an ally to some extent. And yet, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Bond still drives his Aston Martin, drinks vodka martinis 'shaken not stirred', relies on his trusty Walther PPK, and makes a pass at every 'next girl'. He still gathers elaborate gadgets from Q (and still misuses them!). And despite her initial disapproval of him, M still requires 007 to investigate and pursue the Janus crime syndicate. So Bond travels to St. Petersburg and Cuba, discovering a deadly satellite weapon, a conspiracy within the Russian government, an old friend turned foe and two women who are more than just eye candy; one is a psychopathic femme fatale named Xenia Onatopp; the other is a skilled computer programmer named Natalya Simyonova. As always, Bond saves the day by thwarting the villains plans, but there is an added depth to the character hitherto unseen in any Bond film. We learn that Bond is not merely a hired gun for Her Majesty, he is his own man with his own feelings and motivations. And we also learn that while the Cold War may have ended, Bond is yet to completely step out of the cold, after a lifetime of treachery, violence and death. Nevertheless, by the end of the film, we can assume that Bond has at least left some of his demons behind and is prepared to embrace the new world where his services are still required...Pierce Brosnan does a fabulous job as James Bond. His Bond is a perfect blend between the rough and ruthless portrayal of Timothy Dalton and the comparatively smoother and sophisticated portrayal of Sean Connery. Bond's 'boyish charms' conceal the coldness of a professional killer, an aspect which Brosnan masterfully portrays. Sean Bean does a great job as Alec Trevelyan, a darker version of Bond who HAS embraced the new world in order to destroy it. Judi Dench does well in the first of many appearances as M, a portrayal which would go on to evolve and live on beyond Brosnan's tenure in the tuxedo. Famke Jacksen stuns the audiences with her role as the psychopathic femme fatale Xenia, while Izabella Scorpusco does okay as the ever-efficient cool as nerves Natalya.All in all, Goldeneye is in many ways the rebirth of James Bond in the post-Cold War world, much as Casino Royale went on to become the rebirth of Bond in the post 9/11 world.",GoldenEye
217,jtfsouth,Best Bond Comeback!!!!!,8,17 July 2000,"What a lot of people don't realize is that the Bond series almost died after License to Kill. This movie could not have made a better comeback. Before Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan was set to be the new Bond. I was the first to think that he would have never done a good job to uphold the Bond name. After seeing Goldeneye, I could not have been more wrong.
With the fall of the Soviet Union, the movie had a great story line to act on. With the dialog between the characters it made the movie even better. What also put a neat twist on the series was bringing in a woman to play a new ""M"", played by Judi Dench. She plays a bit of a stronger ""M"" character not intimidated by the lady killer Bond and did sweet justice to the part. Another of the better revived characters was Moneypenny, who could really dish it out to Bond.
This movie did sweet justice to the series and has revived a whole new generation of Bond lovers.",GoldenEye
218,The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Great action, great villains, classic Bond",8,5 October 2008,"I've never been fond of GoldenEye. However, I now realise that I didn't enjoy it previously because I wasn't looking at it in context. Coming off the Dalton and Moore films, I was expecting something similar and was disappointed. It was only watching it this time, after Goldfinger, that I realised GoldenEye is trying for the style of the classic 60's Bonds, not the Moore era.Literally, when I watched the scene of Brosnan dispose of a henchman with a towel, then dab his face, it clicked. That was a deliberate attempt to mimic the sophisticated, witty style of Terence Young and Guy Hamilton. Obviously, GoldenEye has to update this for the 90's, and that's the movie's other bullseye. GoldenEye feels more realistic than before, a world of genuine consequences. Subsequent Brosnan movies clearly lost this, and it's alarming to compare the almost cartoonish figure of 007 from Die Another Day with the believable government killer of GoldenEye. Did I say The World is Not Enough is Brosnan's best performance? It isn't, it's GoldenEye. He's lucky that the script was written for Dalton's more volatile portrayal, and he not only gets to play Bond's genuine hurt at his friend's betrayal, but also open up to Natalia about what makes him what he is. In some corners it is suggested Brosnan didn't live up to his potential as Bond, and this is more the fault of the scripts than the actor. They just didn't build on what was achieved in GoldenEye.The movie has great villains; an evil Bond in Alex Trevelyan's 006, perfectly played by Sean Bean (who is always great). Famke Janssen takes the classic Bond bad girl and makes her into a ferocious femme fetale. A beautiful woman who gets aroused by killing people? Is there anything more Bond than that? And the Russians are always worthy villains for Bond.One thing Campbell can do as good as any other Bond director, is action. There is a scene where Bond and Natalya escape from a Russian cell, only seconds, but really poetry in motion as far as action goes. Fast, powerful, unflinching. I'd even say GoldenEye needs more action. Some people think a good action movie simply depends on the budget. To them, I would suggest watching GoldenEye, and then The World is Not Enough or Die Another Day. Campbell is a master of the action scene, those who followed where not. Roger Spottiswoode (Tomorrow Never Dies) is good enough, but his set-pieces lack the precision of Campbell's.As for the nagative details; the locations lack the glamour of Bond. Campbell is not one for attractive visuals. Alan Cumming's character Boris is just annoying. Bond gets a bit too much criticism for being un-PC, the audience is beaten over the head with it, almost. Judi Dench's M is basically just there for that speech. The music isn't very Bond-esquire, but it is exciting enough.So to sum up; the combo of the classic Bond style, with the more real world feel, and great bad guys and action, really elevate this to one of the best of the series. There are two absolutely fantastic Bond moments in the pre-credit sequence - the bungee jump and the freefall into a falling plane - that the series has not been able to match since.So I'm now a fan of GoldenEye, and it only took thirteen years.",GoldenEye
219,hchais,One of my five favorite Bonds,8,9 June 2007,"This is an excellent Bond with lots of action, a good story, and a great cast. I really like it. The story is really good and it's original. That's why I like it so much. There is also a lot of action throughout the whole movie. And when I say that, I mean from start to finish. I think that this is my five favorite Bonds of all time (As of 2007). I think that my five favorite Bonds of all time, in order, are ""Casino Royale"", ""From Russia With Love"", ""Goldfinger"", ""Goldeneye"", and then ""A View To A Kill"". Those are my five favorite Bonds of all time. (The reason I put a view to a kill is because it takes place in San Francisco and I live in San Francisco) Anyway, one of the main reasons why I like this particular Bond so much is the fact that I think that Famke Janssen is the hottest Bond girl to date, even though she's the bad guy and not the main Bond Girl. I mean, she is hot! I love this movie for that. She is so sexy and she kills people by seducing them and having sex with them and strangling them with her legs. I would like some of that action, if you know what I mean. She is just so hot. I really this movie. 8/10.",GoldenEye

Brosnan is everything I pictured James Bond to be, and this had all the right action scenes and role playing to make it my favorite.  It had the most interesting spin in giving us a villain, a former colleague/close friend of Bond and the tension was appropriately applied.  It just all clicked!",GoldenEye
221,busstwilliam,Amazing film,9,22 April 2020,"Martin Campbell has successfully directed 2 bond films....most underrated bond director ever.

222,rchrdshelt,Probably the Best Bond Movie Ever,10,5 March 2005,"I've given this film a 10, not just because I thoroughly enjoyed it, but because I believe its the best Bond ever made. It was actually the first one I watched as well (I watched it when I was 8 and am now 16.) I have seen the rest of them since and still have this one down as my favourite. Pierce Brosnan is terrific in his first appearance as Bond and I think him and Connery are the best of them all who've stepped into the role so far. Izabella Scorupco is gorgeous as his sidekick Bond Girl, and Famke Janssen is brilliant as the sexy villain, partnering Sean Bean, whose also excellent.The plot is simple and interesting, and more importantly, the action sequences are truly outstanding. The opening 10-15 minutes is definitely right up there with the best bond openings and again, probably the best. The movie never drags like several others have before in which I wish the action would just get going after a while. Other action sequences that are decent include some good aircraft crashes and explosions into a satellite dish, a great shootout in a military archive,which leads onto the highlight of the movie- an outstanding tank chase through Russia. The climax is also great as well. Its set at the top of a strange scaffolding, and features a great, suspenseful fight between Brosnan and Penn.The film is Directed by Martin Campbell who must be one of the most underrated action filmmakers around these days. I think this was his debut or possibly his first proper Hollywood blockbuster, and he certainly makes the most of the opportunity given to him. I also liked his other film Vertical Limit, but haven't seen Mask of Zorro. I hope to though. But, this is much better than Vertical limit and I hope he comes back to do another Bond film soon. I recently heard that hes doing the next sort of Bond. A Casino Royale re-make I think. I don't know whether thats even a Bond film and whether its a good idea or not. I'll watch it anyway, and I believe with him at the helm, it has a good chance of being successful.Overall, this is not only, in my opinion, the best Bond film ever made, but also one of the best action films ever made. Its certainly right up there with my other favourites such as The Rock and the Die Hard trilogy.I had a great time watching this and I'm sure you will too, unless you don't like action or Bond of course! Otherwise, give it a rent and prepare to entertained! 10/10 and very highly recommended!",GoldenEye
223,anthonymichaelbangert,Pierce Brosnan has a Golden Eye for Bond,7,17 August 2015,"In James Bond's first appearance after the Cold War comes Pierce Brosnan's first appearance in the role. In this movie, Russian bad guys take control of a special weapon in space. This weapon is essentially a large satellite nuke controlled by a ""golden eyed"" device which can send out EMPs that take out all tech in the hit areas. Combine this with the new attack helicopters they have which are not affected by EMPs and a dangerous problem is created. James must stop the terrorists before they attack the U.K. and go on to destroy the world. This movie brings out a side of Bond that people love. Dropping countless corny one liners, an enormous sex appeal, a female villain who literally kills you with sex (and whose name is a sex pun) named Xenia Onatopp, and countless action scenes and villain monologuing are all over this film. It brings out a bit more humor to the 007 franchise, and is a fun experience. Pierce Brosnan brings an excellent take on the character, and Judi Dench as the new (and first female) M is wonderful and refreshing. Altogether, this is a fun Bond experience, and definitely one to have in your collection.7/10",GoldenEye

I gave it because it certainly has a lot of energy and well let's face it a Bond girl who gets her kicks killing by simulating sex with her victim well it was the ultimate ""OTT"" (over the top).The plot? Well it is just a the same tired old plot lifted from ""Our Man Flint"", earlier Bond flicks or Austin Powers - evil genius wants to make boatloads of money by blowing up the world, New York, or in this case London and Bond (Powers, Flint) saves the day. Substitute Dr. Evil for Alex Trevelyan and well, you get the picture.But it did have lots of energy even if it was OTT and quite often lacked any sense of credibility (plot, action - you name it).",GoldenEye
225,Workin_Man,My Favorite Bond Film Ever,10,17 April 2006,"This Bond film is in a class of its own. Goldeneye is by far the best Bond film ever. It is definitely my favorite Bond film. I have 3 reasons for that. First of all, Pierce Brosnan. He makes an amazing debut as James Bond and I think he is the best Bond yet. Second of all, Sean Bean. I have seen a lot of his previous work and I think he is an amazing actor. In this film, he is incredible!! His performance is absolutely astounding!! Last but not least, reason #3. The action. The action in this film is very impressive!! I was astounded by the car chases in this film. This film is definitely the best Bond film for action and possibly even one of the greatest action movies of all time!! Goldeneye was directed by Martin Campbell who, in my opinion, is the best director a Bond film has ever had. He has a great style that works wonders with this film. I'm just hoping that Casino Royale will be just as good or better than this film. I'm sure it will. Mr. Campbell really seems to know how to make an action movie. Let's hope he does whatever he did with this film and applies it with Casino Royale. In conclusion, Goldeneye is the best Bond film yet and I enjoyed every single minute of it. I know you will as well.",GoldenEye
226,anifanmc,"The ""First Reboot""",9,23 November 2008,"I have always argued that there have been two instances in the Bond franchise where the story and style have been rebooted in order to fit the changing needs of the time. The first was the introduction of Pierce Brosnan and Judi Dench with Goldeneye, and the second was the introduction of Daniel Craig into Casino Royale. Being the First Reboot, Goldeneye holds a special place in my heart as the film that both introduced me to Bond and also reinvigorated a dying franchise - for the first time.Pierce Brosnan, the new James Bond, is an amazing choice for the protagonist. In fact he would have won the role had Remington Steele not been renewed for another season - but then again, he would have likely been cast in the rather mediocre films that Timothy Dalton ended up starring in. Instead, Goldeneye is a well-written film with cinematography that truly took Bond to a new level, and was the first to deal with the state of the world following the Cold War.In keeping with the theme of post-Cold War problems, the movie centers around post-Soviet Russia, which is seeing a capitalist revival and the rise of a corrupt mafia and government. During an operation at a chemical weapons factory, Bond's compatriot, Agent 006, Alec Trevelyan is killed by General Arkadi Ouroumov, a Soviet general. Approximately ten years later, he returns to Russia to investigate the theft of an experimental electronically shielded helicopter capable of withstanding the most powerful electronic countermeasures. Concurrently, a Russian satellite weapon known as the GoldenEye destroys a secret complex in Siberia - the platform from which it is controlled. The sole survivor, Natalya Simonova, escapes with the knowledge that Ouroumov is behind the attack.Bond finds out that the theft of the helicopter and the detonation of the GoldenEye device was masterminded by a crime syndicate known as Janus. The organization is revealed to be led by none other than the thought-dead Alec Trevelyan, a traitor seeking revenge on England for murdering his parents, who were Lienz Cossacks, a group of Russians who sought asylum in England and were deported. His ultimate plot is to use the GoldenEye satellite to wipe out the electronics of London - and by doing so, destroy the financial market of Europe and cause the world economy to collapse as an act of revenge.The plot is beautifully Bond-like, and while from a scripted perspective seems stereotypically megalomaniacal, Trevelyan is not a typical villain. He is a vengeful, angry assassin who seeks revenge, not glory or money. His plight is understandable, not the result of some deluded fantasy, and Bond makes it his personal mission to kill him - not because of Dear England, but as he says, ""for me"". It brought out a whole new character in James Bond, a quality of pride and vengeance that had not been seen in Connery or Moore - and only touched upon by Dalton. Oddly enough, this is usually one of the criticisms of Daniel Craig's Bond, his vengeful nature, and yet Brosnan is the one who sets the precedent.Judi Dench is a completely different M from her predecessors, most of whom either were entirely antagonistic to Bond or were gruff old men who gave Bond a free reign. She is a cold, calculating, ""ice queen of numbers"" (as Tanner puts it) who considers Bond an asset outwardly, but thinks of him almost as a son. She is subtle and decisive, acting in a way that is often unexpected, and her wit is, of course, worthy of recognition.Although perhaps not the best of the Bond films, GoldenEye is considered one of the best, and Brosnan, despite all odds, proves himself as a contender for the iconic model of the super-spy. His legacy will (and has) defined that of his descendants.",GoldenEye
227,antileft,A Prescient Bond,7,5 September 2008,"The first Bond movie with P.Brosnan was a huge eye candy , action galore , stunning and breath-taking ,even in some instances simply overdoing it , against all laws of physics , specially the initial scene , where Bond jumps off a cliff into the huge ravine ,trying to save his skin by catching a diving plane no less ! , and what was so important - remaining true to the basic concept , namely , fighting a villain or an evil organization bent on taking over the control of the world , all set in the real world in real conspiracies , very possible scenarios and 'realpolitik'- geopolitical situation at that time , in this case Russia and chaotic situation there in the mid-90s. The title signifies a powerful EMP weapon satellite having been built unknown to the West during the Cold War , and the weapon's activation and its consequences are shown in one of the best scenes in the action /war genre so far. All other typical Bond elements are here : beautiful girls , especially the Russian computer programmer , brilliantly portrayed by I . Scorupco , who becomes entangled in the life and death battle against her will , car chases  Bond in a tank , original ! , and another unique gem  the arch nemesis , a former Russian woman army pilot with an elegant name - Onatopp, who gets her rocks off either by squeezing her 'lovers' to death or shooting them to little bits , and is indeed an original example of women's sadism , and , the obligatory final duel , reminiscent of one in Empire Strikes Back !

It was everywhere and when the film finally dropped, it announced very definitively that Bond was back in style!Pierce Brosnan was a great choice, bringing a lot of the menace and danger Dalton had re-instilled while blending Moore's humour with Connery's charm. It was also nice to see another fleshed out 00 as a character. The direction from Martin Campbell is slick and concise, with some stunning locations and great stunt work.The music is a little patchy in places, never quite feeling like it has an identity throughout the film but the theme song from Tina Turner is perfect. Perhaps another of Goldeneye's greatest strengths. Quite unforeseen at the time, was the videogame it would spawn.

Just look at Pierce Brosnan and tell me he does not fit the mental image of Bond.

233,DMP-2,"A Great Action Film, but not a great Bond Film",5,17 September 1999,"GoldenEye is very well done, but not as a Bond film, it was missing to many elements, such as ""Q"" gadgetry. Brosnan although far better than poor George Lazenby (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) is one of the worst Bond's atleast in this one (in the next one he tries a little harder). Joe Don Baker returns as a sidekick for Bond although played a villain against Timothy Dalton, 8 years earlier in the LIVING DAYLIGHTS (1987). Thats another thing Brosnan is a very sharp drop from Timothy Dalton's work as Bond. He had said that Connery was excellent, but would not copy him, although he wound up copying Roger Moore (as a matter a fact Moore was 46 when he start playing Bond, and Brosnan wasn't far behind at 43, although Dalton started at 43 too).

After playing the game for a while, I decided to check this out again(I had seen it three or four years ago). I loved it! It was great to watch it. Although I pretty much knew and liked most of the things in this show because of my fondness and knowledge of the game, it is very well perfect in its own right. For one, it has a cast that is spectacular. Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond ever, Judy Dench is a much better M than all of the others, and Sean Bean and Desmond Llewelyn did a good job themselves. The lady who played Natalya was terrific too. Famke Jansen was acceptable at times, but her character(Xenia Onatopp)is a little freaky. It has a very good plot too. Janus, an evil corporation that is lead by Bond's former friend and MI6 partner Alec Trevelyan, has stolen the Goldeneye satellite and plans to use it to destroy major cities. A plan to destroy the world is nothing new when it comes to James Bond, but this is the kind of pressure and danger James Bond was created to live for. It is a movie that has a nice flow and a good combination of sequences to make it a classic. And who could forget Boris? Too funny! Another big reason I am fond of this movie is that it was the show that launched me into James Bond. I give this 4 and a half out of 5.",GoldenEye
236,zanghi_james,Definitely Pierce's best James Bond performance and a nice precursor to Daniel Craig's standard Bond films,9,12 July 2019,"I grew up watching James Bond films. The original series is good times, though Roger Moore's are definitely the most comedic (save for The Spy who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only, and Octopussy), and the Daniel Craig's are definitely the definitive modern Bond experience. Pierce Brosnan's Bond films are a bit of a mix bag of swings and misses...save for the first one: GoldenEye.Pierce does a great job portraying James Bond for the first time out. He shows some great emotions as the character throughout the movie, showing pain and regret before the big reveal of the villain and anger and frustration afterwards. Sean Bean is pretty great as the villain (plus he has one of his best death scenes of his career in this film, defeated only by his performances as Boromir and Ned Stark) while Famke plays a really sexy and deranged femme fatale. Izabella Scorupco plays an okay Bond girl. She and Bond seem friendly together, but there's little attraction. For the supporting cast of characters, Joe Don Baker and Robbie Coltrane are extremely memorable and likeable, while Judi Dench gives a great portrayal as M (Though no where near as good as her swan song in Skyfall), and Alan Cumming is oddly likeable as the villainous Boris Grishenko.The film is a little dated and grainy, compared to the crisp clear feel of the Daniel Craig Bond films, but there is less CGI style explosions and more real ones. However, you can quickly tell when they used miniatures and props, most primarily in the Severnaya sequence. Eric Serra's industrial-synthesizer score is really different for a James Bond film, barely bothering to use the usual style, but it just seems to fit.All in all, definitely one of the best Bond films out there as well as Pierce Brosnan's best performance as James Bond. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a good Bond film or just a good espionage film or even just a great action film from the 90s.",GoldenEye

238,sterlinrivera-2000,The 2nd Best Bond Film,9,4 February 2020,"Goldeneye is easily the second best James Bond film ever. This was the one that introduces Pierce Brosnan, who I think is the second greatest Bond actor, and was the one where action gets really well made and makes it satisfying to watch.The film is where a very intense and powerful satellite system falls into the hands of Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean), who is also known as Agent 006. James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is the only one that can save the world from being destroyed as Trevelyan wants to use the system for evil use. Bond also has to battle Trevelyan's stunning partner, Xenia (Famke Janssen) and Bond teams up with the beautiful Natalya (Izbella Scorupco) and together must save the planet.Goldeneye is beyond fantastic. It has really awesome and kickass action that makes you want to keep watching it over and over again, and this was, again, the first Bond film to hsve that particular action.
The story is really well developed and the people behind this film really took their time with it.
Pierce Brosnan was awesome as Bond. He had an accurate personality and knew how to be a legit hero. Sean Bean was great as the villan, and the rest of the cast was really good as well.

The acting was great, but i think the factor that made this movie very good was the fact that they created a movie that is not similar to old James bond classics. They also took out a lot of cheesy bond one liners (like roger moore) and did a more real down to earth James bond. I still have a problem with the classic cheesy love story, bond girl elements the director threw in here,( which is not a lot, but still it's there) but still the action was a awesome (especially a huge improvement in hand to hand combat) then the classic bond films. The story line was also refreshing, having the villain be a agent of england itself was very clever as well as entertaining. If you want to see a new modern day James bond then this is a must see and buy movie.

Add to that the legal wrangling over the rights and a slew of other would-be action franchises, and it seemed as though Bond's days in the sun were long gone.Enter 'Goldeneye' and Pierce Brosnan.  Everything changed, as the old suave and debonair secret agent was given a 90's update, brought into the new age of action, and giving birth to a resurgence in the appeal of Fleming's timeless hero.  The success of 'Goldeneye' was key.  If it flopped, Bond really was finished, and the whole franchise was cooked.  If it succeeded, another batch of sequels would be ready to go, and the franchise would breathe new life.  It was all or nothing.  And it delivered the goods.Brosnan had been the original choice to take over as James Bond when Roger Moore retired from the role, but was contractually obligated to TV's 'Remington Steele', so Dalton got the role instead.  Eight years later, he was still the natural fit, and that helped ease the transition. 
Other changes needed to be made.  Samantha Bond came on board as the new, 90's-friendly Moneypenny, who could hold her own with James on the innuendo scale, and serves as the eternal foil to the randy secret agent.  The best change, however, was the addition of Dame Judi Dench as the new, hard-nosed M, a female authority figure to temper Bond's 'boys will be boys' mentality. She's gruff, she's decisive, and she's got attitude to spare.  One link to the past was Desmond Llewellyn as Q, back again for another round as the master of the spy gear.So there are the changes, how how is the film?  Excellent, and on par with the standards set by the older, beloved Bond films.  There are four key elements to any Bond film:  the villain, the plot, the stunts and the women. 'Goldeneye' hits solidly on at least three of the four. 
Sean Bean is a twisted shadow of the hero as 006 - Alec Trevelyan, a former associate of Bond believed killed in Russia, but secretly behind the theft of Goldeneye - a Russian orbital weapon capable of delivering a massive electromagnetic pulse to anywhere on the globe, causing catastrophe and mayhem in its wake.  As an ex-agent, he's an equal of Bond and knows all his tricks.For the women, there is one deadly and one sultry, both appealing in their own way.  Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) is an assassin who specializes in 'intimate' kills, and has a psychotic delight in physical confrontations. Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) is a programmer who had worked on Goldeneye and falls in with James Bond - she's everything feminine that appeals to the agent, as well as bringing something to the table - she knows the computer systems that can stop the weapon.The stunts work, for the most part.  There are the daring dives (bungee-jumping off the side of a dam), the vehicle chases (a tank in the streets of a small Russian town), and the climactic struggles (atop a satellite hundreds of feet off the ground).  It's well-filmed, nicely paced, and offers enough thrills without completely crossing the lines of believability (with one or two minor exceptions).The plot is the only really thin part - there's no real rationale given behind 006's plots, other than he's the Villain.  At the end, some mention is given about a theft scheme and revenge on the English for atrocities committed on the Cossacks after World War II, but there isn't the world-spanning, power-mad, fiendishly over-the-top scheme that is almost always found in a Bond film.  Alec Trevelyan is dangerous, yes, but he's not quite in the same league as Goldfinger or Dr. No.'Goldeneye' did what it set out to do - it revitalized an old franchise to the point where Brosnan's fourth go-round as Bond is about to be released, and there appears to be no slowing down.  In an ever-changing world, it's always nice to know that one thing is always constant.  Bond. James Bond.",GoldenEye
241,Serva,The weakest of Brosnan's Bonds,8,27 January 2002,"I'm a big fan of Bond movies, I think I've seen them all and I gladly watch them again as many times as I can. My favorite Bond is Sean Connery (but Roger Moore does it good too) and as such I also like the movies he was in the best, and I think that is why I think this is a pretty weak part of the series. Where films like Goldfinger and Dr. No are very unrealistic when you think about it and rely much on Bond's sly attitude, one liners of course, and how he interacts with the bad guy, Goldeneye I think is just too serious. Bond and the main evil guy Trevelyan are like best friends and then they hate each other it just doesn't work. It's not supposed to be like that. There are however good parts, some funny one liners from Bond, Izabella Scorupco is sexy as hell and I agree with the commenter who said she is probably the most good-looking Bond girl so far. So don't get me wrong, I still think Pierce Brosnan works as Bond, the next two movies with him - Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough - are *much* better and I hope he does a good job in the upcoming film. It has already been said but I just have to point it out too, the music score was very bad here. Rarely noticeable at all and I can't remember one scene where you actually hear the theme song we all know and love so much.",GoldenEye
242,Chanandler-Bong,"One of the best Bond films with one of the best Bond's,",9,3 November 2012,"I'm slowly working my way through all the Bond films, I've seen a fair few now and I was really impressed by Goldeneye. The acting was brilliant. Pierce Brosnan is by far my favourite Bond. He has it all, the witty character, the smooth-talking act that would seduce any woman, good at the action scenes and my favourite part of his role is he has good charisma. I really like his cheeky smile. The chemistry between Bond and Natayla was excellent, one of the best chemistry''s I've seen. My fav scene was where he picks her up in his arms and says ""Darling, what could possibly go wrong?"". As well as the good acting from Bond and Natayla, Sean Bean was brilliant of course. All the other actors were great. I love the flirting between Moneypenny and Bond, makes me laugh every time. As action goes it was full of it. The tank scene was just awesome. No other word could describe such a scene (Lots of things got smashed). Cinematography was good, some really great scenes. It's a shame that Brosnan didn't get better Bond films after this one. The other's just weren't as good. Plus his cars are awful until Die Another Day.I think he would be far more respected as a Bond if he'd got better films after Goldeneye. But for the 90s this wasn't too jam-packed with cheesy lines or cheesy moments, it was actually an incredibly good movie and probably my favourite Bond film (so far)...Mind you saying that, Skyfall was amazing. They're level at the moment! But anyway, he's the best Bond because he pulls off all parts of Bond's role superbly from being the lovable ladies man, to cold hard killer trying to save the world from Villains with ridiculous ideas that would never work. Pure brilliance! (Or Brosilliance.... yup there's your 90s cheese for you). I love the Bond films, all the Bonds (especially Brosnan,gorgeous hunk that he is) and I've started reading the books too and Pierce fitted the description too! Anyway, brilliant film, loved it and have re-watched MANY times.",GoldenEye

245,randy_kay,a ho-hum Bond movie,4,15 July 2012,"I'm not a big Brosnan fan. Watching him is like watching a runway model try to act. His acting seems 'flat'. He's sort of like David Bowie or Sting in that he seems overly nervous of letting down his pretentious front in fear that he will be left vulnerable. It's either that with these kinds of people or they are just plain shallow and do not have anymore depth than that, who knows, surely we never will. Anyhow, I think he's definitely the wrong person to be playing Bond.Famke Janssen was nice eye candy and a pretty good depiction of a bond woman -- obviously hot, intelligent, classy but also sensuous -- she was well cast and played her part well.The old James Bond films were the best. Not because they were old, just because they were better.I doubt producers read these IMDb comments (they should if they don't), but these modern Bond movies could really use some surf guitar for the incidental music. The reason I think surf guitar works is probably for a few reasons -- it's cool yet cheesy and gives a sense of comedic release without having something overtly comedic happening visually. Sound and music is very important yet is too often overlooked. The best modern soundtrack I have heard was for Get Smart (2008 release). That movie btw totally blew most of these 'thriller' type bond movies out of the water -- all that and it was actually a comedy -- go figure.",GoldenEye

247,prudhoeboy,From 00 to 007,10,12 October 2021,"Considering where the Bond franchise was coming out of the 1980s, basically done, this movie was nothing short of a miracle. Who would have thunk that Pierce Brosnan could go from toting Stephanie Z's bags in Remington Steele to 007 with such apparent ease and actually pull it off? I know I didn't. What's more he carried the franchise through the 1990s in a memorable way as much as Connery did in the 1960s and Moore did in the 1970s until aging out of the role. In retrospect it appears the TV show helped him hone is skills in acting, especially being spontaneous and energetic. As for Goldeneye, it perfectly captures the mid-1990s period when the internet was becoming popular and technology had advanced enough not to look hopelessly dated 25 years later. In addition to Brosnan coming through as Bond, surprising memorable performances by supporting villains, including Alan Cummings (Boris the computer geek), Famke Janssen (Xenia) and Valentne Zukovsky (Bond's Russian mafia contact) really made the movie. Joe Don Blake, who appeared in License to Kill, also helped transition from the 1980s to provide a sense of continuum. The criticisms I have of the movie are as follows:1. It didn't show any scenes of London under seige and M having to deal with the political fallout or politicians caving into demands as in classic bond movies. The movie could have been 15 minutes longer to capture all this.2. The theme song was also a bit weak albeit sung well by Tina Turner.3. Many reviews are saying the movie took the franchise out of the Cold War, yet there is still enough Russia-bashing rhetoric in the movie to satisfy the palates of aging Cold War hawks and western foreign policy, which virtually ignored the fall of the iron curtain.3. To the extent the franchise needed a re-boot, it might have been more progressive in that regard rather than pc pandering. Just a suggestion but too late to save the Craig era.Hey, this movie took the franchise out of the 80s with flying colors. Credit the writers and casting also. They obviously worked hard on this one because they knew what was at stake. For that it deserves a 10 if not a 15.",GoldenEye
248,Reef-Shark,Best Bond film of 1980-2000,9,1 April 2009,"GoldenEye is one of the best runs in the infamous James Bond franchise for many reasons. To start off, this is one of the few 007 adventures combining camp, humor, and gritty realism all in one while still providing the amazing set-pieces you would have come to expect from the original Bond films. This is a new flavor for James Bond, yet has enough home touches that it feels right at home in the series.Being the 17th entry in the never-ending series revolving around the British super agent this film had a lot of history to live up to, but under the direction of Martin Campbell (who would later comeback to direct the superb Bond film Casino Royale) this is one of the most fun and thrilling entries in the entire series. There is homage to the original Bond films, but this film also takes full liberties to make itself an entirely new, refreshing entry in the franchise.Tina Turner provides the vocals for a very classy opening song (with lyrics and music written by Bono and The Edge). As far as ""Classic Bond Songs"" go I can say that over the last fifteen years this is by far the most classic Bond song ('You Know My Name' from Casino Royale is my favorite, but it lacks the characteristics of a ""classic Bond"" song). The opening montage that goes to the song is also on of the most intricate, visually fascinating ones I have seen in ANY Bond film and really gets the audience pulled in.Okay, now that the little aspects of this film are out of the way Let's take a look at the things that really make this a special entry in the 007 Franchise. This is the film also brought in a new Bond in the form of Pierce Brosnan, who plays the part exceptionally well. Brosnan brings wit and charm to the role like a mixture of Connery and Moore with his own twist added in. This Bond is cool-headed, but when confronted with the thoughts his own actions it becomes apparent that Brosnan's Bond is a man who hides lots of feelings under his cool façade.The villain of this film is something you'd think the Bond franchise would have done before and that is the concept of a MI6 agent who is a friend of Bond going rogue. Alec Trevelyan (006) is played by actor Sean Bean and makes for a particularly cold, and coolheaded villain who being someone who knows Bond close gives dialogue that you have never heard before in any other Bond film.""I might as well ask if all those vodka martinis silence the screams of all the men you've killed...or if you've found forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women, for all the dead ones you failed to protect."" That is what Trevelyan says in this film that you have probably have never thought of before when watching James Bond. This is one of the defining aspects of GoldenEye because it is one of the few Bond films that effectively asks the question ""Who is James Bond, and why does he do what he does? How does he live with himself? Of course the villains aren't the only ones confronting Bond with this question. Even Bond's girl of the movie turns against his charm to question his attitude and his actions. Natalya (Izabella Scorupco) goes so far as to ask Bond why he's so cold, to which Bond replies with an emotionless stare: ""It's what keeps me alive."" In the days of Connery he'd never be asked that, and he would never reply in such a manner, which shows a more human aspect of Bond's humanity. It is modern and somewhat shocking to see Bond, one of the greatest icons on cinema be asked these questions and it allows the audience to actually sympathize with the lovable character who has always manages to spend time in casinos, shoot bad guys, escape from exotic traps, and make it out safe and with the girl.GoldenEye is one of the best entries in the James Bond franchise, and Peirce Brosnan makes for one of the best Bonds I have ever seen and it is really a shame that in his later films he wasn't provided the proper scripts that would have allowed him to truly leave his mark on the franchise. It is a shame that Campbell didn't do any more of the entries with Brosnan, but he did bring us the brilliant Casino Royale.",GoldenEye

I was not a Pierce Brosnan fan prior to this movie, I suspect that this is his best work, although this movie has the tightest writing for a Bond picture - Judi Dench's first appearance as well on the Bond scene adding a different nuance to the pseudonymous M. Pierce Brosnan seems to be well in action movies and there is a high degree of realism to this flick adding to the adrenaline rush of the shots and fast-paced storyline.

250,tomasg-69814,Brosnan 1st and Best.,8,13 February 2016,"At last...Pierce Brosnan got it. One of the most honorable missions a male actor could been given in the mid 90's. And he'd been in the shadows for years, just waiting to get the chance. (The ""Remington Steel""-work was put to extension in the late 80's, blocking the production team from already choose Pierce in front of Timothy Dalton as 007 in ""The Living Daylights"".) This first movie of his are still the greatest, by all means. The story, the women, the whole environment is just perfect mix for a Bond movie. Yes, loans from the past is always there, for the sharp-eyed. But that means nothing to a Bond fan like me.... Love the DB5 evaluation scene; classic 007.Sean Bean does very well as former MI6 agent, who's thirst for more got him into multi-million blackmailing business. Got the right looks, got the sense of a single-minded villain just right.Pierce Brosnan knew that this work was kind of responsibility. And GoldenEye shows it. He puts all of his efforts in it, knowing that his appearance was important.He was sadly never to make an equal 007 movie like this. Not his fault; the merchandise thing took over the movies completely after this. And the goodbye-movie Die Another Day was way out spaced, too super-natural for me. It was meant to be kind of a tribute to earlier Bond, celebrating the 50th anniversary of 007 on screen.Pierce Brosnans Bond was good, but not unforgettable. We will always remember him for his natural given ""Bond""-looks, and this great movie.",GoldenEye
251,simbrab,A modern classic of the Bond series,9,8 August 2016,"One of the biggest challenges for modern era James Bond movies has always been meeting the best possible compromise between gritty realism and old-school Bond campiness. Some ended up way too far on the gritty end (Quantum of Solace), some tried too hard to reenact classic Bond camp and turned out utterly ridiculous (Die Another Day) and some are all over the place between the two extremes (Spectre). GoldenEye is the one that hits that perfect middle ground.Martin Campbell directed both this one and Casino Royale, and there are indeed some similarities between the two movies. It starts with the score music, which is generally more contemporary than in other Bond movies (some may say generic, but it goes well with the action sequences), while the classic Bond theme music is reserved for one crowning moment of awesomeness. Both GoldenEye and Casino Royale can be regarded as a reboot of the series, in which Bond gets a makeover and generally a more modern vibe. GoldenEye often doesn't get enough credit in this respect, but it introduced the by far strongest female character this inherently sexist franchise has ever seen. Enter Judy Dench as M, Bond's new boss, who is not afraid to call Bond out on his character flaws and to raise the question if an old-school spy like him is still relevant in modern times - long before Skyfall did it, and even longer before Spectre rather lazily rehashed that plot point of the former. Then there's the theme of betrayal, a former friend and colleague who becomes an enemy to Bond, leading to a few rather serious moments that make the title character reconsider some things he used to believe in. GoldenEye did it, long before the post-Jason-Bourne reboot starring Daniel Craig popularized the theme within the series. Even the obligatory Bond girl, Izabella Scorupco as Natalya Simonova, is not just an accessory part here and more of a strong, independent woman, a computer specialist turned sole survivor of a terrorist attack, who actually contributes to the resolution of the plot in the final showdown to a great extent. Speaking of the plot, it is actually quite realistic for a Bond movie. The cold war is over, but the relics include super-weapons that have now become useless, and wherever there's an gratuitous super-weapon, there's terrorists trying to take advantage of that. Credit has to be given to Sean Bean here for his portrayal of a distinctly human Bond villain.And yet GoldenEye still has all the ingredients of a classic Bond movie. There's gadgets. There's one-liners. There's baccarat and Vodka Martinis. There's a hilariously over-the-top (or more like on-a-top) caricature of a mercenary with superhuman strength and a lust for killing that even disturbs the evil masterminds. That happens to be an extremely attractive woman with an aptly ambiguous name. Classic. There's also an iconic theme song, arguably the second-greatest one in the entire series right after Shirley Bassey's ""Goldfinger"". And, last but not least, there is THAT TANK CHASE! These ingredients alone would be enough to make GoldenEye a good Bond movie. What makes it a great one is the fact that, very much unlike Spectre, the result of all this is a coherent, well-balanced and well-paced movie. It doesn't seem out of place for this Bond to have his moment of doubt and pain and in the next scene race a tank through St. Petersburg while casually adjusting his tie. Credit has to be given to Martin Campbell, who quite frankly should have directed every Bond movie ever, if his record is anything to go by, but also to Pierce Brosnan, who does a quite formidable job absorbing all the traits of the previous portrayals of Bond. He is a snarky womanizer like Sean Connery, he is physically strong like George Lazenby, he is witty like Roger Moore, but he also masters the darker and more serious territory of his predecessor Timothy Dalton. You may call it a composite character, but that's exactly what makes this movie work so well.Obviously, there are some flaws, but compared to other Bond movies the list is relatively short. Alec Trevelyan, despite everything that's great about his evil-but-distinctly-human character, suffers a serious case of Bond villain stupidity when he carelessly wastes more than one opportunity to easily kill Bond for good. There are some outdated stereotypes, e.g. ""the Russians"", a cast of German, Dutch, French, Polish and Scottish actors who - even in private - only talk in English with a fake Russian accent. Or Jack Wade A.K.A. that American guy from the CIA, who is portrayed in such a stereotypical manner that the authors wisely decided not to (ab)use the Felix Leiter name for the character. And the Bond car is a bit disappointing. It has the usual missiles, guns and other gadgets, but they are never used. Purists might be bothered by the fact that it is not an Aston Martin or a Lotus, but a BMW Z3. And that considering it doesn't do anything cool, it seems to be in the movie just for the sake of product placement. I personally used to like the BMW Z3, but when I watch GoldenEye now, I have to admit that it is one of the few things in this movie that haven't aged well.But, seriously, who cares about Bond's car when there is a TANK CHASE?",GoldenEye
252,rh86,The Best Brosnan Bond,10,2 February 2007,"In the early 1990s there was a great deal of concern about the Bond series. Licence to Kill didn't do as well as expected while the changing world events made people ask whether Bond was relevant. But in 1995 Bond proved himself in this excellent film. Directed by Martin Campbell (who also directed Casino Royale) Goldeneye puts Bond firmly back on the map. It addresses the criticms levelled at Bond in several ways. His sexism is now countered by Judi Dench's M while the writers bought Bond back to Russia, once his enemy now a not always trustworthy ally.Pierce Brosnon never did better, not quite of the standard of Connery but comes pretty close and just manages to combine the qualities of Connery and Moore. The Bond girls also stand out in this movie. At one end of the spectrum there is the ultra realistic Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), a computer technician who is thrust into Bond's world after being betrayed by a Russian General. Unlike other Bond girls it takes her a while before she actually falls for Bond. At the other end of the spectrum there is Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp and her killer thighs, probably the most over the top Bond girl ever. As for the villains, Sean Bean does well as Alec Trevelyan, a former MI6 agent turned arms dealer.Bond purists complained about the lack of gadgets and Eric Serra's avantgarde score (which is actually pretty good aside from it being mostly taken from Leon), but ignore them and enjoy.",GoldenEye

But Xenia Onatopp is what really made it good. Over the years Bond has had many villains, but hardly any were women. Goldeneye finally came up with a good woman villainess, though Mayday was also good, Xenia was so hot. She had her unique way of killing people by suffocation between the thighs and she was sexy.

And it does so, even if the geekiness which it is regularly subjected to is rather unnecessary. Otherwise, this is well-timed and highlighted by some effective action and henchwoman Onatop's steamy scenes. Under the circumstances which demand a politically correct Bond, Brosnan delivers a smooth and refined performance without ever aspiring to counteract Connery's virtues. The film's masterstroke, however, is that it gleefully recycles Bond shenanigans with irony obliquely suggesting the character's past sell-by-date status, and yet it manages to glorify him as a timeless hero; and this can surely be defined as nothing else but a confident display of sophistication.",GoldenEye

As silly as the Evil Bond Girl is; as stunningly unbelievable as the airplane stunt before the credits is, as implausible as the Russian accent on the Computer Hacker is, this is a worthy addition to the Bond Series of films.  Maybe not the best one, but it earns it keep. Bond is once again pitted against a villain bent on destroying a major city, and again he is aided by a brainy but buxom babe.  Sound like 90% of all Bond films?  Yes... what did you expect? Good stunts, good acting (for the genre), good characters (especially the CIA agent), and good special effects.  Not too many ludicrous plot twists, some witty lines, and some of the usual titillation make this a fine film to watch Sunday night when your brain really needs some eye candy.",GoldenEye
256,ADAM-53,What's the motive,1,29 November 1998,"This is probably the weakest in the series, with a Bond (Brosnan) and a villain (Bean) who simper at one another more like girls in a convent school than two hardened secret agents. After an absence of almost eight years it is easy to see why a new generation of fans, who'd never seen Connery, Moore and some decent Bond films on the big screen, would be taken in by what looks like a TV movie. They should get some of the older films on video or DVD and find out what they're missing, because this one's got TURKEY written all over it. To start with the opening sequence: these usually create the atmosphere in which the audience is able to suspend disbelief for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, the death-defying opening stunt, where Bond parachutes over a cliff, defies the laws of gravity and catches up with a plane already in freefall simply by leaping after it, is clearly just nonsense. Compare this with the opening scene in Moonraker, in which Moore's Bond catches up with a man already in freefall by using known parachuting techniques. Sorry, guys, but even Moonraker is better able to suspend disbelief than this! At least Moonraker didn't look like it was filmed entirely with a computer graphics package. The next problem is the Bean character's motivation. He changes his reason for doing what he's doing two or three times: his family was sent back to Russia to be executed by Stalin (which must make Mr Bean at least 65 to start with); he hates Britain (well, that's not unreasonable...); he also hates Bond; he's doing it for the money! Yea Gods! Can't he just make up his mind? They've given him the scar, so he's the bad guy! And was he already a traitor at the time of the opening sequence or not? Why doesn't anyone bother to tell us? Aside from these implausibilities, there is the problem of Brosnan. He just hasn't got any screen presence; he sounds American and he looks like he would be unable to pick a fight with a packet of fried potatoes, let alone a real tough-guy. After two Bond films (The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill) in which Timothy Dalton had gone back to Fleming's books for inspiration and found a man haunted by his past, who is sometimes forced to question the sanity of what he does but who, when action is called for, does not hesitate to do what he knows to be right, Brosnan looks a trifle inadequate to say the least.",GoldenEye
257,jackhamel1987,An explosive reboot.,9,12 June 2013,"After 6 years, Bond finally made an explosive comeback with this strong entry into the franchise. Goldeneye (named after Ian Flemming's house), is easily Brosnan's best Bond, and there's no doubt that this is set Bond on a better path. This has some fabulous action scenes, some strong acting, better and believable gadgets and a very neat, tight plot. In the dying moments of the Cold War, James Bond (Brosnan)and his friend and colleague Alec, 006 (Sean Bean) are sent on a mission to destroy a dam and weapons depot in the USSR. Alec is killed, and Bond is able to escape. Years later, in Russia, a rogue General steals a secret Russian nuclear weapon that can destroy electrical circuits. Bond is sent to investigate, and soon finds that the General is working for someone else, and that someone wants revenge on Bond, and Britain. There's no doubt that Brosnan's Bond was the most complete since Connery. Whilst I thought Lazenby was hard done by, Moore was a hit and miss, and Dalton was underrated, Brosnan really does tick the boxes. He's suave, smart, good looking, and can handle the serious with the light-hearted. Even now, with Daniel Craig as Bond, Brosnan really is Connery's heir. It was just a shame that he didn't have better story lines further on. Brosnan is also complemented by a very strong supporting cast. Sean Bean is a strong villain, even if not the strongest, and gives some heart the the villain who was perhaps betrayed. Izabella Scoripco is a very strong minded Bond girl, who isn't afraid to fight, and doesn't spend all her time screaming endlessly. Robbie Coltrane is on hand to provide excellent support as the Russian Mafia, and finally Judi Dench excels as the first female 'M'And then there's the action. If you like action, you will like this. From the opening scene at the dam, to the ST Petersberg chase, to the climax. It's pretty non stop, and benefits from not being too cartoonish that you can't believe it wouldn't happen. Even if there are some moments in the plot that don't quite make sense, you just don't care. All in all, a very neat, impressive Bond film. 9/10.",GoldenEye

The plot is actually well done, the action is some of the best of the series, and even the acting is surprisingly great. The only complaint I have is the villains, or rather too many of them. At the end Bond goes up against an ex-agent, an assassin, a Russian general, and a computer hacker. Yeah, not all at the same time, but I just felt like maybe one of the characters could have been removed or eliminated before they start the last act. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this Bond film more than a lot of Bond films, and that's saying something.",GoldenEye
259,MondoMirth,Closing Time James,8,2 January 2020,"I don't understand how this movie isn't categorized as a comedy, it's much better if you think of it as so.

260,BrohmaBull007,The Modern Day Bond,9,11 March 2006,"Bond returns in this thriller of a movie. After a 6 year hiatus of big problems about ownership and rights we finally get another Bond film. Pierce Brosnan finally gets his chance to play Bond and he delivers after all the hype. Brosnan making his debut as Bond and gives some fans (like me) a fresh breath of air from the lackluster Moore and the good yet little known Dalton. Brosnan has everything down from those classic Bond lines to his slight resemblance to the previous bonds. It is a shame Brosnan couldn't play Bond earlier because he could have started a bit younger. His hair is his only problem in wardrobe but he fixes that in TWINE. Sean Bean plays an excellent villain including being able to fight Bond instead of sending a henchman. We get to take in the beautiful sights of the islands making it a perfect setting. The plot is actually pretty interesting as I feel it is new and pretty straight forward. This marks the ""first"" of many new trends of Bond films like CGI and I believe Dolby Surround was also in this one as well. This takes Bond from the 60's and we get the modern day bond. Bond tackles more challenging missions while having bigger action sequences in movies to come. I enjoyed this one. 8/10",GoldenEye
261,C.S.Wood,"One, if not the BEST, of Bonds",9,22 April 1999,"Famke Janssen was my favorite character over Bond. Natalya even gave a sort of 'innocent girl' scenario, but kicked ass when the mission called for it. Brosnan is an ok Bond for his first Bond movie. Martin Campbell did a great directing job, but it still lacked in a few ways.A great pro and con goes for the writers: good for giving Bond more of a heart (beach scene) and giving a reason why the enemy keeps Bond alive instead of killing him like we all scream at the screen, but bad in not doing anything with his car (which practically saved Tomorrow Never Dies, which I thought could've been better).Sean Bean as Trevelyan was a good Bond villain to remember.   It wasn't the best, but it wasn't near the worst of any list for me. And playing the video game for Nintendo 64 reminds me of it and makes me watch the movie again from time to time. It will always be remembered as a pretty good Bond. Not great, but pretty good.",GoldenEye
262,daryl42-1,"Goldeneye will satisfy you if you're a Bond fan, but also if you're a fan of good cinema.",9,22 July 2010,"9.1Bond films have always had a special place in my heart. There's something about that mix of British accents, suit wearing and wine drinking combined with secret agent espionage, ass kicking and world saving that calls for a response in me. At the end of a Bond film, I always want to change my career to become a 00 Agent. I sit down and realistically brain storm as to how I can achieve this. I might start a military career, then join the FBI or CIA, and then sit down with some of the higher ups and say to them, ""look, I know you guys have a 00 Agent like position, and I would really like to try out for it, if I can't make it, well, then you can kill me, since this is my dream anyway."" And then I snap out of it, of course, as the movie's charm fades away. But Bond films are always special to me, and when they get it right, everything just seems that much less silly.Goldeneye is one of the ones that got it right. It brought us both Martin Campbell's debut as a director for the Bond series, and Pierce Brosnan as Bond himself. Both are respectively great for the Bond films. Martin Campbell shows us that he knows how to direct a movie. Pierce Brosnan is who I think of when I think of James Bond. The character Bond, in my opinion, should be a tactful, yet wild fellow. A man who is soft spoken, but his actions weigh heavily on those around him. He is a man who gets the job done quietly, and when he speaks, he says a lot. Yeah, OK, maybe the guy (Bond) is kind of like my role model, but I think Brosnan did a great job in portraying him, and it's clear that he was a good choice.Bond films have always had a major problem with them: They are essentially B movies. The villains are silly, the dialogue can be cheesy, the plot is usually goofy and over the top. Goldeneye has all of these problems, but also gives us a bit more. Goldeneye offers more in the departments of direction and cinematography than you would expect out of a Bond film. There are scenes in the movie, such as a character's face being obscured by shadows just before he steps out into the light, revealing his identity. And a close-up shot where a door opens, revealing Bond's face behind it which makes it seem like a scene transitioned from side to side. For all its problems, Goldeneye more than makes up for them. In the intro scene where Bond jumps off a dam while the film's signature music is playing, you will be convinced that this Bond film seems promising.After Goldeneye, Bond films became milked and were essentially all about what we look for in Bond films on a sub-intelligent level. Women used as pornography, luxurious cars, witty gadgets, and gunfire with explosions. Bond was transformed from a one man team to a one man army. What I love about Goldeneye is that it doesn't suffer from this. It's a Bond film where the filmmakers wanted to make a good film, not just a Bond film for the sake of being one. Goldeneye will satisfy you if you're a Bond fan, but also if you're a fan of good cinema as well.",GoldenEye
263,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,"Along with Goldfinger, the most overrated Bond film (SPOILERS)",6,12 March 2005,"With 1989's ""Licence To Kill"", Albert R. Broccoli showed that he could make a dark and gritty film while keeping the necessary elements of a James Bond adventure. The audience at that time showed him that they didn't care, and LTK did not do as well as previous outings in the franchise, causing a 6 year gap between the next one, which eventually turned out to be ""GoldenEye"", a weak venture that only proves how excellent ""Licence To Kill"" actually was in comparison.I know, I know: But ""GoldenEye"" is great! It saved the series! Pierce Brosnan is the best James Bond! Blah, blah, blah. We're all entitled to our own opinion and while I appreciate what GE did to the future of James Bond, the film doesn't compare to earlier classics and doesn't know a cliché that goes unused. The entire affair is like a greatest hits package without the spark of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" or the class of ""Thunderball"".The main failing of the film is that all it does is seek to remind audiences that this is a Bond film, and while this was necessary at the time, watching it now, it's a huge distraction. Within 30 minutes, every possible trademark has been checked off: a casino scene, the Aston Martin, ""Bond, James Bond"", vodka martini, a femme fatale, a big stunt, evil Russians, and on and on and on. There might as well be a neon sign pointing everything out. At least something like ""Moonraker"" is content with the fact that it's a Bond film and doesn't need to remind anyone.The movie opens with a sequence that shows Bond in action with a fellow agent and sets up the character of Alec Trevelyan AKA 006 (Sean Bean), who's supposedly killed by Colonel Ourumov. The beginning could've been much better had it not contained so many continuity errors and a stunt at the end that is so incredibly lame and unbelievable you'll wonder if Bond has bent the laws of physics. Basically the serious tone of the Dalton era is ignored in favour of the same old Roger Moore-type nonsense.The movie continues with a good title song from Tina Turner, even though it tries to blatantly copy ""Goldfinger"" (which has, for some reason, become THE film to borrow from when one wants to be ""Bond-ish""). After the main credits, though, we get an absolutely terrible car chase between Bond and Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) that has the worst musical cue in the series, consisting of some random beeps and honks. The movie plods along and basically everything until Russia is dull, filled with atrocious dialogue, and introduces nothing new to the Bond caper.When we do find out who the villain, Janus, is and what he's planning, the movie picks up and we get the action in a wild shoot-out, an exciting tank chase, a tense stand-off in a train, and an explosive finale in Cuba that's even more interesting than most because the relationship between Bond and Trevelyan was sufficiently developed to the point that we're rooting for the both of them to win. But to get there is not worth your time, and it's ironic that these set pieces are the highlight of the film, instead of it's drama or story.Then we get some bizarre attempts to make Bond ""relevant"" to the '90's by having the new female M (Judi Dench, who is better in every other Bond film after this) and Miss Monneypenny emasculate him to the point where I wanted to puke. Not only that, Monneypenny downright rejects Bond's advances and he stands there taking everything without comment. These few scenes, along with a score that sounds like it belongs in a B-grade '80's action film, immediately makes the flick lose 2 stars.What almost makes up for all this lacklustre material is the cast. Almost. Sean Bean gives a forceful interpretation of 006, providing a match for Bond at every turn and also getting some of the best lines in the movie, if not the series. Gottfried John as Ourumov is an imposing figure and completely believable, while the Bond Girl this time around, Natalya, is attractive and smart, while holding her own. She's probably the best out of the Brosnan era and can actually act. And Robbie Coltrane shows up as Valentin Zukovsky, one of the most inspired characters in years.Unfortunately, the other two leads, Janssen and even James Bond #5, Pierce Brosnan himself, don't stack up to the other actors. Xenia is just way to over-the-top and ruins any scene she's in. And the all-to-obvious fake accent doesn't help. The complete opposite is Brosnan, who is uneasy in the role and doesn't grab our attention. Plus, his haircut is too jokey to be taken seriously.And while the film's only 2 hours and 10 minutes long, it drags and feels longer, killing any replay value. So, even with some good acting, other elements work against the movie, and the useless ""updating"" does nothing but show that James Bond is a timeless character and shouldn't be placed in any specific era. The end result is definitely a mixed bag. 6.5/10",GoldenEye
264,mafster,Bond's Greatest Adventure to Date,10,15 July 2002,"What a Bond film!  This combines fast cars, sexy women, superb villains and a great Bond.  Pierce Brosnan's first outing as the Agent is spot on.  He slides into the role and smoothly struts his stuff through the picture. Sorry Connery, you were good, but Brosnan's better.  The story line is excellent and the feeling of the East vs West gives an impression that the cold war returns.  It carries an amazing blend of superb ingredients from previous Bond outings which is why the film works.***  SPOILER ALERT START  ***Alec Trevelyan, Bonds friend and co-agent 006, fits into the villain role perfectly as a two-faced traitor.  Sean Bean is superb and although he hasn't got a metal arm or a bowler hat he feels more real than most villains.  The ending is fantastic and it literally goes down to the wire. Agent vs Agent - Spy vs Spy - 006 vs 007.  The ultimate battle.***  SPOILER ALERT FINISHED  ***One other good thing about this movie was that it inspired a game to appear on the N64 and it is just fantastic.

265,asdodge,The Long Awaited Appearance of Brosnan as Bond Does Not Disappoint,10,12 December 2008,"The Bond films had done well recently, but had lost something. Roger Moore was never fully accepted by some as Bond, though he was just as good as Connery, albeit different, and had gotten old and the stories were silly. Timothy Dalton was a great Bond, who also never got accepted and was caught in the era of a ""politically correct"" Bond, where the advent of AIDS, Reaganism, and other events forced the makers of the Bond Films to try to adapt. You can't adapt who Bond is to a politically correct world and Dalton was the scapegoat- sad, because he was good as Bond- probably the most physically accurate depiction of Bond, based on Fleming's descriptions.Anyhow, the Bond folks took a few years off, rather than the 'every 2 years"" policy that had existed since ""Thunderball."" In that time, Communism fell, which may have been a good thing, but world politics became less stable and the rise of Russian gangsters and their eastern-European counterparts occurred.At the same time, a US television show, ""Remington Steele"" made relatively unknown Pierce Brosnan a star. His character had all the charm and suave of James Bond and folks began saying ""he would make a great James Bond."" Unfortunately, TV contracts kept him from being able to take the role that went to Dalton. By 1992, ""Remington Steele"" had faded away and Brosnan was available.With 5 years to prepare, a new, already-popular Bond now available, EON productions was ready to bring Bond back with a bang. And they did. Set amidst the changing Cold War dynamics and international intrigues of the day, ""GoldenEye"" was the best anyone could hope. Brosnan was already in Bond mode (no adjustment necessary) and he proved to be a truly 50/50 split of the Connery and Moore portrayals. The confident swagger and looks of Connery with the quirkiness and humor of Moore were mixed with a solid plot (with a couple of not-possible events- once again, the Bond writers do not understand lasers)...All the elements are here... this is the full Bond Formula used to its best effect... from titles to end credits, all the elements of the stereotyped Bond are here, but re-vitalized with a more current and topical storyline, the action and intrigue one wants, and new technology for film-making that improves many of the stunts and special effects.Brosnan's Bond movies would later devolve into the world of cheap trick gizmos, poor one-liners and ridiculous plots, but here it is all to the good. There are only two weak spots in the film- the laser knowledge 9again) and while exciting, the recent ""chase scene"" is a little too weird and in reality, not even the greatest super agent in the world could have pulled it off and escaped as Bond does.The tension between Dame Judi Dench (as the new ""M"") and Brosnan (as Bond) hearkens to the old Connery-Lee days, but their interplay also suggests a temporary moving away from some of the sillier elements of the ""Bond Formula."" Women are now totally on equal footing and the love interests are not simple jiggling breasts with an empty head or overzealous hard chicks which showed up in the 80's.Sean Bean is excellent as Bonds one-time friend and partner, Alec Trevalyn, and comic Robbie Coltrane has a great appearance, too. No cheap jokes, no overtly campy stunts. ""GoldenEye"" hits with true realism that too often fades from the Bond movies in favor of shiny toys and silly gimmicks.Definitely one of the 3 best Bonds ever made.",GoldenEye
266,theonewithallthecontacts,One of the best Bond films to date!,9,4 November 2012,"After License to Kill's disappointing box office, there would pass 6 years before the next Bond film would be released. During those six years many events occurred; Dalton thought he had aged too much since License to Kill so that he refused to declined to make another Bond movie, long-time screenwriter Richard Maibaum suddenly died of old age, Albert R. Broccoli's producer's chair was passed on to his daughter Barbara. The biggest question however was if Bond was able to find his place in the new world, after the Berlin-Wall fell. Luckily, the answer was yes! Remington Steele-star Pierce Brosnan was cast as James Bond, one of the most visionary Bond directors Martin Campbell was directing, Michael France wrote the story, Jeffrey Caine and Bruce Feirstein wrote the screenplay and Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli was producing!The opening title sequence takes place in 1986 in the USSR. James Bond and Alec Trevelyan aka 006 is to infiltrate a military compound and blow it all up. One of the best Bond stunts occurs at the opening when Bond jumps from a huge dam (actually shot at the Hoover-dam)! The stunt is beautifully shot and marvelously executed by the skilled stuntman! After that a cool sequence ensues when Bond and Trevelyan silently infiltrates the compound. However, the mission goes awry, 006 is killed and then the film jumps over to a huge action sequence! The whole thing is beautifully shot and executed with Bravour! Then Tina Turners cool title song is heard and you immediately know that this film is gonna be extraordinary!Martin Campbell directs Goldeneye with finesse and professionalism, and the whole thing pays off! Martin Campbell makes everything in this movie so intense and interesting, that you probably are gonna see it more than once! The screenplay and the story is brilliant and so is the cinematography! The action and the whole film is very skillfully edited and choreographed. Gotta' love Goldeneye!Pierce Brosnan is brilliant in the role as Bond! He has both the Moore and the Connery feeling about his portrayal! Sure, he is charming and he can crack a quick joke, but he can also be a serious and calculating Bond at the same time. Brosnan is therefore a brilliant choice to the role of Bond! Sean Bean must be one of the most iconic Bond villains of all time! Not only is he a revenge-driven and calculating enemy, he is also 006! He know all of Bond's moves before he does them, and is therefore always one step ahead of Bond! Bean's performance is also very solid and memorable! Izabella Scorupko as the Bond babe is also very great. Her and Brosnan have some great chemistry, she is beautiful and a good actor. All the virtues of a true Bond girl! Famke Janssen is a brilliant sidekick to Sean Bean's character! She is ruthless, psychopathic and perverse more than any other Bond villain ever shown! She strangles people with her legs, and has some sort of orgasmic pleasure in killing people! How evil is that?! Janssen is one the most memorable and scary Bond villain ever shown! Gottfried John and Alan Cumming also portray cruel and memorable Bond villains. Robbie Coltrane is also good in this movie as Valentin Zuckovsky! Judi Dench as M is a true pleasure to watch! She owns the role. Nough' said. The film has some minor set-backs, though. After a cool tank chase through Moscow, the film slows down and therefore the pace also slows down! It seems like sometimes there are a few scenes not very important, when all you wanna see is the epic conclusion to one of the best Bond films ever! Also some lines in the movie only makes sense, if you've seen all the other Bond movies. However, these are only minor complaints to an otherwise masterpiece of a movie!Overall, Goldeneye is one of the best Bond films to date, and one of my personal top 5 Bond films! 9/10",GoldenEye

As my summary states, this film is passable as a Bond film(definately better then TND)but gets bogged down in the middle during the theft of the Goldeneye. Brosnan's performance is servicable, but we really wouldnt see his take on the character until the recent TWINE.

About 15 minutes of real story.Pathetic.(sigh) I have nothing more to add, but IMDb requires I type in 10 lines, so let me add: *Pierce Brosnan did an excellent job as Bond.* It's not his fault the script was so shallow (in fact, Brosnan recently said in an interview: ""I quit Bond... I grew tired of saying silly lines in silly scripts""). But Brosnan's acting skills are very good & remind me of the excellent Sean Connery. Watch Brosnan's performance in Die Another Day.Overall, I rate this movie Goldeneye as the one of the worst of the series (about equal to Moonraker).

270,Sabriane,Very enjoyable Bond film,7,5 January 2007,"""Goldeneye"" was the first James Bond movie I've ever seen almost ten years ago. Having rewatched it after ""Casino Royale"" had re-ignited my interest in the Britain's most famous spy, I found that the film holds up remarkably well and is heaps of fun.There are really only two things - a small one and a big one - that let this film down for me. Small one is the awful tinny score that plays during the otherwise fantastic cliff race near the beginning. Bleh, bleh, bleh. The second, I'm sorry to say, is James Bond himself. Now, I like Pierce Brosnan; he has charm and sophistication about him, looks heavenly in a dinner jacket and is smooth with quips and one-liners. But his Bond is just way too self-consciously smarmy and smug for my liking. And I feel that whenever the script tries to go beyond the polished surface and give the character some dramatic weight, Brosnan is completely lifeless and the scenes themselves are rendered emotionally flat. Mind you, I'm not sure whether it's the fault of the actor himself or whether it's just that the film tries to have it both ways and those ""character"" moments simply don't gel with the overall silly-ish, glossy vibe of the film.Thankfully, this movie also possesses a hugely entertaining ensemble of secondary characters, not the least of which is Famke Janssen's sexy and demented Xenia Onatopp, a truly outrageous, over-the-top ""bad"" Bond girl who revels in being a sensual, bloodthirsty monster. Alan Cumming is also fun in the cartoonish yet enjoyable role of Boris Grishenko, an evil uber-geek. Sean Bean is cold and ruthless as a former 00 agent turned traitor; he's also pretty much the only reason why his character's scenes with Bond have at least some measure of the intensity to them. Izabella Scorupco makes a charming and endearing ""good"" Bond girl who's actually got a brain and is relevant to the plot. Robbie Coltrane and the inimitable Dame Judi Dench have brief but memorable appearances as the former KGB agent turned crook and M, Bond's formidable boss who openly dislikes her charge.The opening scene involving a dam and a bungee jump is still pretty spectacular, as is the tank chase through the streets of St Petersburg, one of my most favourite cities in the whole world. It gives me a giggle to see Bond cheerfully destroying public property and driving with a big bronze horse on the top of the tank, :) So yeah, I still like this flick a lot and it's one of the only two Bond films I've really enjoyed.",GoldenEye

The series is updated as noticed by talk about sexual harassment. Also, the cold war is over and M lets James Bond know that by calling him a relic of the cold war and a dinosaur.  She's also quick to criticize his cavalier attitude towards life. Over the next few Bond films, M warms up a lot more to Bond.Goldeneye had a good cast of characters playing the bad guys. Sean Bean did an excellent job playing a former British agent joining a crime syndicate. The female character of Onatopp was both good and original. She likes to squeeze her victims to death in a body scissors.  Each character's personality in Goldeneye was well scripted.  Goldeneye is actually one of my favorite all time Bond films because of the cast of characters.",GoldenEye

I did watch it, twice, when it was released in theaters, and remember just loving it to the max. Brosnan was a darn near perfect bond after Connery. And the technology, gadgets, and special effects were all brought up to date by Martin Campbell. But looking at it now, what came across as cool and awesome then comes across as goofy now. Brosnan is still awesome, but everyone around him, and the storyline, brings forth unintended chuckles. The whole pun on the Onatopp word, the admiral with a stupid smile on his face, Boris spiking the DOJ and the FBI, the character of Boris itself, all seem goofy and shallow when watched now. Brosnan is a savior no doubt, and the action scenes are also awesome, so it is not entirely a dud. Still watchable, but certainly not ageless.",GoldenEye
273,mcfische,Connery-esque Bond films work in the modern era,7,4 October 2003,"May contain spoilersGOLDENEYE was the 17th production in the 007 series. Following the release of LICENCE TO KILL, MGM and United Artists became involved with legal issues that would last until 1992 and prevent another Bond film from being made for six years. During that time, Timothy Dalton, in my opinion the best actor to play James Bond, resigned. An actor who had originally been chosen to play the role in 1987 before being called back to REMINGTON STEELE, Pierce Brosnan, was selected. The stakes were high for this Bond adventure; the Cold War was over and conventional Hollywood wisdom stated James Bond was dead and that action films suffer when released in the winter. Both were defied, and GOLDENEYE remains the most successful Bond film in terms of generating revenue.The film replaces the Fleming-style dark Bond with a more Connery-esque style, harkening back to DR. NO and GOLDFINGER. Pierce Brosnan's Bond combines elements from all the previous actors; Connery's womanizing and overall style, Lazenby's compassion, Moore's reliance on gadgets and humor, and Dalton's vunerability; but it is largely Connery's style that is used. Brosnan carries the film successfully and plays a great Bond. I personally would've prefered them staying with a Fleming-esque style; in scenes where Dalton would've been nervous, tense, and anxious, Bronsan remains to calm, and for a man who lost his wife, he seems far to compassionate towards his ladies; but it works all the same. His portayl of Bond relfects that this character is from an era long since over, but finds his place in the world today. This film plays a twist on the villain. He plans to make millions, but isn't rich to start with. His main motivation is the British betraying his parents in WWII. And he is a former ally and close personal friend to 007; Alec Trevelyan, alias 006. The British felt he was too young to remember the events of WWII and Bond's changing their plan at the beginning of the film in Bond's final mission in the Cold War era results in the right half of his face scarred, hence his new name; Janus, the two-faced Roman god. Sean Bean plays the role magnificently and is completely believable. Bond's woman in this film is more a liberated woman of the 90s, but surprisingly, is less Bond's equal and less heroic then four of her predecessors; Pam Bouvier of LICENCE TO KILL, Melina Havelock of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, Pussy Galore of GOLDFINGER, and last but certainly not least, Teresa di Vicenzo of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (a brief, indirect reference to her is made by Alec). The villainess are Xenia Onatopp, played by X-MEN's Famke Janssen. She looks different in this film, but still is great for the role. Alan Cumming, also from X-MEN, appeares as the double-crossing computer geek Boris, a humorous character. The Russian general, the other villain, I found to be over-the-top and too one dimensional. Desmond Llewelyn returns as Q, but is the only veteran Bond actor; Robert Brown and Caroline Bliss resigned from their roles as M and Moneypenny. The latter is now played by Samantha Bond, in a much more modern and enjoyable style then her predecessors while still retaining Lois Maxwell's grace and charm. The M in this film is not Sir Miles Messervy, but a new superior, a woman. She is as tough as her predecessor, and Judi Dench helps return to the M/Bond scenes what was lost when Bernard Lee died. Despite her skill in the role, Nobody Does it Better then Lee. Joe Don Baker, who previously played the villainous Brad Whitaker in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS, returns as Felix Leiter's CIA replacement Jack Wade. He is another comedic character and one the audience enjoys. Rounding out the cast is Robbie Coltrane as Valentine Zukovsky, an enemy-turned ally of Bond's from the Cold War.The film has more faults then has been stated, however. At times, the special effects look rather fake, including the use of bluescreen CGI in sequences where models and miniatures would've been far more effective. The film's music is pleasant to listen to but not Bond enough and often works against the scenes. As I said before, the heroine isn't tough enough and one of the villains is over the top. And sometimes Janssen's accent is too shaky.The film's faults don't give a lot of damage and it is a very good match-up with GOLDFINGER. I give it an 8 out of 10.",GoldenEye

But if you're seeing the Bond films in a sequence, you'll realize how weak this film truly is.It feels like a ""previously on Bond"" sequence before a TV show. It is as by-the-book as it comes, a film written by a checklist or excel sheet to hit all the points and check all the boxes.Some may blame Brosnan, but it's hard to blame him for this script. What can he do with just cheesy one-liners? They're barely witty. Some of them are not even good enough for an 80's cop film action hero, much less coming from the mouth of a classy Bond.Boring action, cheesy action, random motives, spoon-feeding the audience the story, a villain with a scar to not confuse the children as to who is the bad guy.Fails in the face of both predecessors and successors.",GoldenEye
277,voxparody,Golden Eye Candy,5,21 April 2005,"Not bad for a James Bond film: The gadgets and gizmos are here, courtesy of 'Q' (God, the actor's 'teeth' are down to his knees!); the ladies are coiffed-then-mussed from all the fights and near-death explosions; the obligatory Monte Carlo Casino (or wherever else they speak lame-sounding French) wherein Bond orders his shaken-not-stirred martini; and..oh, of course... the prolonged opening sequence somewhere in a snowy country, in a remote area where our immortal hero can jump off a cliff (in this case, a 722-foot bungee-jump off a huge dam).The verbal sparring between Bond and 'M' (ably played by Judi Dench) is memorable, an eloquently funny set piece if ever there was one. ...oh, and 'Q' telling Bond to set down his Sandwich.Although I am an occasional 007 fan, I found myself getting my movie franchises a bit mixed-up. I expected Tina Turner to come out of a submarine, with poofed-up hair, stroking her diamond-stud-collared white cat... but that was another 007 sequel, and Turner only sings the 'Goldeneye' theme song. Anyway, MGM-UA should make 'Mad Max vs James Bond.' Why not?--20th Century Fox made 'Alien vs Predator!"" Anyway, I'm sure Die-Hard Bond fans will enjoy this outing immensely.I also thought Terry Hatcher was in this one (instead, it's Scorupco... or Sciroco, or whatever her name is--has she done much else since this 1995 film?)",GoldenEye

It has the awesome action sequences, the twists and turns, and a charismatic lead. The action sequences are well made and pretty cool. The cast is amazing with Pierce Brosnan perfect for the role, Sean Bean being a great villain, and Judi Dench making an ""appearance"" though she did reprise her role in the sequels. Of course this movie has Russians as villains which for some reason, from the late 80s to the mid 90s, Russians were villains for like almost every single blockbuster from Rocky 4 to Air Force One which is really awkward and I daresay stupid but we're not here to talk about that. Although this movie has great scenes it also has some awkward scenes like I don't know what the car chase scene at the start of the movie is supposed to be. It's kinda funny to me and in that scene in the background there is this WEIRD and cringy music playing which made me laugh out loud. But the best part is the song Tina Turner made which is just brilliant like I liked it even better than the movie just such a great song. And it is important to remind that there has been one of the best video games that is based on this movie. It has some flaws but I nonetheless love this movie but like what came out of it better. I also think the turn in this movie worked even though it might be kinda overdone nowadays but it was good at the time. And the toilet scene is just iconic and great.

279,dmbjam29,Pierce Brosnan's First and Best Bond Movie,8,30 January 2007,"After the 6 year lay-off from 1989 ""Licensed to Kill,"" the Bond franchise returns in 1995 with ""Goldeneye."" I believe this film proves to be not only be one of the best Pierce Brosnan film, but one of the better movies in the whole franchise.During the six year lay off, the international spectrum changed with the Berlin Wall and communism falling. The Cold War was always the force which drove the James Bond series and the filmmakers needed to transition Bond into the New World Order of the early 1990s.The movie has many great strengths, the strongest being Pierce Brosnan himself. There has not been a better Bond since Sean Connery. Both men seem to have this incredible presence on camera, and look dashing in their suits. Another strength is the plot. Unfortunately for spoiler reasons I can not disclose much information, but the movie examines a personal side of Bond in regards to his relationship with one of his former Double-0 agents. Another strength is the addition of Judi Densch as M. She is absolutely terrific in the role. She provides a perfect contrast to Bond and the franchise certainly took a tremendous leap forward in her casting.The rest of the typical Bond ingredients are there, exotic locations (Meditterean, St Petersburg and Cuba). The gadgets with Q (Desmond Llewelyn) and the action sequences are great (primarily the opening sequences, climatic fight at the end and the tank chase in Russia).The only negatives were very slight. I felt that there were too many witty one-liners, I thought Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) was a little bit less than average in the performance as Bond girl and I thought the musical score was unnecessarily bland. The music was very disappointing along with the theme song.Looking back at the four films Brosnan did this one is the best. It took the Bond franchise in a slightly new direction (however not as drastic as the Daniel Craig film would). And from top to bottom it has one of the strongest plot, action sequences and feel of a Bond film not only being the best in Brosnan's career but being one of the better films in the whole franchise. It is a must see for Bond fans and should be an enjoyable experience for movie goers alike.8 out 10!",GoldenEye
280,frostyfrog,GoldenEye,6,30 March 2020,"GoldenEye is a film directed by Martin Campbell and stars Pierce Brosnan, Sean Bean and Famke Janssen that tells the story of British Secret Agent James Bond trying to stop a Russian syndicate from unleashing a weapon known as ""GoldenEye"" on the world. Within the next week ""No Time To Die"" was scheduled for release so in the spirit of things I went back and took a look at a quintessential bond film that I had not yet seen actually. For me though Bond films all boil down to a few things in particular and those would be the man playing bond, the villain, the love interest and the music. I've long known that I can't go into most Bond films expecting fantastic writing because most entries aren't entirely focused on that aspect albeit with a few exceptions (Casino Royale and Skyfall). In this entry Pierce Brosnan dons the gadgets and tuxedo as the suave secret agent and he does a fine job. He's charming, stylish, clever and as M (wonderfully portrayed by Judi Dench) points out, a womanizer and egotistical. Izabella Scorupco does a fine albeit slightly forgettable job playing the bond girl and I actually had to go on to IMDb to find her characters name. She honestly wasn't to memorable and not too many of the bond girls are until the more recent films. Sean Bean did a great job as the villain and the way his villain was written was very interesting as Bond had to face someone with his own strengths and weaknesses. I do want to say that how Alec Trevelyan became the film's villain was easily forseeable but again the film isn't really focused on a plot that's too intricate. The music in typical bond film fashion was wonderful and despite being similar if not the exact same in this particular set of Bond films, I still enjoyed it. Overall, I'm reviewing this film more as a Bond film than am actual film because that's really what you have to do. Look at the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, I mean it has a set of tropes the way that these Bond films do and if we all knocked each film as we all got bored with those tropes, those films wouldn't have any fans but they do and so do the Bond films. Still though I do enjoy when a film in these series often subverts what you'd expect and thinks outside of the box delivering a unique idea in an otherwise predictable experience. GoldenEye didn't lack that as multiple characters pointed out what James was doing wrong and how his ego would be his downfall and he actually used that knowledge to help him and others in the final act. Overall, GoldenEye is a good bond film and even just a good film with a few unique ideas mixed in with the usual tropes and hilarious over the top moments featured in this era of Bond films.",GoldenEye
281,Walls Of Jericho,One of the best Bonds,8,29 May 2002,"After a six year hiatus, Goldeneye was the perfect return to the screen for 007. With all the women, the chases, the action and the gadgets, Bond proved he could hang with the action oriented films of the 90's.
Pierce Brosnan may be the perfect Bond. He has the coolness of Connery, the smugness of Moore, and even a dash of the harshness of Dalton. He puts it all together to make what Fleming probably had in mind as far as the look of the secret agent. Goldeneye is smart, high tech, and more slick than most of it's predecessors. It doesn't rely on the camp of the later Moore outings nor the completly cold emotionless Dalton films. It updates itself enough for the Clancy era of spy tech, while still holding on to the old fashioned sleuthing we are used to. Also the femme fatales are wonderful, especially Famke Jansen as Onatopp. Overall, Goldeneye is high on my list of Bond films, top three behind ""Thunderball"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever""",GoldenEye
282,Dehlia_,One of the Finest of 007's Career!,10,10 September 2002,"I am still trying to figure out why some Bond fans dislike this movie. I think it's nearly perfect. It has everything terrific about the franchise -- some real espionage (the plot isn't handed to Bond all at once, as in some of the inferior entries), it hangs together (no real dangling set pieces), it's great to look at, it has some dynamite explosions, some really sinister villains, an amusing ally, and very sexy women. Underneath it all, in this first post-Cold War Bond, is an examination of what the post-Soviet world of espionage and crime might really constitute, as all of the characters struggle to find their place in it. One telling scene takes place in what amounts to a Soviet graveyard -- a junkyard of old statues of Lenin and other Soviet icons.  The female lead, Izabella Scorupco, is especially notable. As computer analyst Natalya, she witnesses the mass murder of all her co-workers in a blaze of mayhem. Unlike the spy smoothies we're used to, Natalya weeps, screams, and mourns, before showing the steel she needs to rescue herself and eventually team up with our hero. I very much like how, in those early scenes, she's dressed as a computer analyst and not as a glamour girl. Her beauty shines through and later she gets a bikini.  The great cast includes Judi Dench, Robbie Coltraine, Sean Bean, Alan Cummings, Famke Jansen, and Joe Don Baker. 10/10",GoldenEye
283,msquared,Almost there,8,6 March 1999,"A nice, archetypal Bond movie with a strong performance from Brosnan and some nifty special effects.  I'm still not as enthralled by the more recent Bond films, but GoldenEye is definitely an improvement over the last three or four.",GoldenEye
284,adam_evans14,The mother of all modern bond films!,9,28 December 2008,"After a slump in the franchise, James Bond took a few years break, and knowing they'd have to produce a terrific film to get fans back on side seems to have helped. This film is superbly done.To start with it has to be said the opening sequence itself will get you hooked. The dam jump is one of the most memorable incidents in the franchise. After the theme song is over (by the way a terrific song to go with the film), A disk that operates a satellite dish is stolen, and bond is sent to relocate it. The best thing about how the film pans out is, that aside from pierce brosans obvious understanding of the suaveness of the character, the plot line itself means the audience isn't entirely sure of who the real villain is until half way through the film.The villains themselves are well acted, and its clear that all have their different purposes in the scheme, e.g Orumov is there to ensure they can penetrate the base in which the goldeneye is stolen from, and Boris is there to actually operate the disk. The point I'm making by this is that the plot is clearly well thought through.This film is a must see in the point franchise as it blends action and espionage so well, which is what a James bond film should be. The tank chase in Russia, the dam jump, and the climax of the film itself are all memorable moments in the James bond franchise. Seriously watch this. You wont be disappointed",GoldenEye
285,namideo,Bond for a new generation,8,27 November 2008,"Compared to all that came before it, GoldenEye is a vastly different film, at least in terms of style. The trademarks are all still there. The tuxedo, the martini, the ""Bond, James Bond"" delivery, and even the original Aston Martin DB5, all make an appearance, to establish the validity of it being a Bond film. I believe this film's overall motive, if it had one, was simply trying to say that, while times had changed, Bond has not changed. What seems to be emphasized through these trademarks is 007's timelessness. Outside of these aspects, however, the film takes on an identity of its own. The first thing to notice is that it is surprisingly dark. Not necessarily in terms of seriousness or violence, although there is certainly that, but more in terms of the overall atmosphere, particularly the scenes in Russia, which come off very bleak, even Gothic at times. It is a unusual style that somehow works for this film.The plot takes full advantage of a post Cold War world. Bond still has strong connections to the former Soviets, only they are not the enemies this time around. There is a subtle shout out to feminism, when the misogynistic James is forced to take orders from his recently appointed chief, the new female M, played by the marvelous Judi Dench. Both Dench and Brosnan play well off of one another and each slip smoothly into their roles.Brosnan proves his worth as Bond. He certainly looks good in a tux (I mean that in the most heterosexual way) and appears very comfortable in his own skin. He is not the kind of tough, hard hitting Bond, but he successfully pulls off an interesting combination of humor and vulnerability, along with a sheer athleticism that pays off in the action scenes. You can tell he is putting forth the effort while having fun in the role.Sean Bean (Patriot Games, The Lord of the Rings) gives us our villain, Alec Trevelyan, and in many ways, he is a shadowy reflection of Bond himself. He is one of the few villains that really mix wit with brawn. A former ally turned villain, he is one of the most formidable foes in the series, pushing our hero's limits. Bean plays the character with such relish that he makes you want to root for him at moments.The love interest in this film is Natalya Simonova, played by Izabella Scorupco (Vertical Limit, Reign of Fire). Aside from being a beautiful actress, her character is given a substantial chunk of the story all to herself. We see much of the crisis that takes place from her perspective. She has just as much stake in the overall plot as Bond does, which makes the story and their relationship ten times more interesting. The first half of the film follows each of their individual stories, and when we get to the point where their paths intersect everything falls into place, and we fully understand each character's motivation.The action is pretty spectacular. Granted, there are moments when the envelope is pushed a little far. Nevertheless, it will keep you engaged throughout the movie. On the other hand, one thing I appreciated about this film is that it did not depend on the action sequences to create excitement or suspense. There are several moments that pit our characters in hazardous situations that manage to create intensity without the use of explosions or gunfire.I consider it a must for any serious Bond fan. Although, what is also great about it is the fact that one does not necessarily have to be a Bond fan to enjoy it. Outside of a strong cast, a great script, spectacular sets and locations, it's stylish, exciting, sexy, and most importantly, it's creative. It's Bond for a new generation.",GoldenEye
286,Fred_Maxwell,Brosnan flic less camp then Moore's,8,10 September 2009,"Typical of the 007 genre this one has all the chase scenes and explosions you would expect or want including Bond chasing the bad guys through St. Petersburg in a tank destroying everything it his path. The plot is interesting and the whole thing is less camp than some of the Roger Moore flicks. That's true even with a Russian villainess who's thighs squeeze the life from her prey leaving the corpse with a smile on his face. There is a Russian computer nerd named ""Boris"" and I have to admit expecting a line about ""making big trouble for moose and squirrel"" but it never happens. There is no sign of Grace Jones in this Bond either so I'm happy on both counts. On the home front ""Q"" has become even more crotchety and impatient of 007 and ""Moneypenny"" has been replaced with a newer model more suited to the younger Bond's innuendoes.",GoldenEye
287,Drew-36,Fantastic New Beginning for Bond,10,21 March 1999,"Of course, I'm biased, but this film is fantastic - the villain, Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean), who almost had more money than God, is excellent, the women are sexy, and the inclusion of Robby Coltrane and Minnie Driver as his mistress is pure genius. All the classic Bond elements are back in place, and the film spawned an amazing N64 game. Pity about Tomorrow Never Dies, though.",GoldenEye
288,Orpington,Brosnan gets off to a great start,8,2 October 2003,"It seemed for a long while in the early 1990s that we would never see a James Bond film again, as the franchise became enmeshed in endless legal wrangles and a disillusioned Timothy Dalton decided to quit as OO7. However EON productions were eventually able to begin work on the 17th official Bond film, and GoldenEye exploded onto the big screen in 1995, six years after the release of Licence to Kill. Happily the wait was worth it, because GoldenEye is one of the best Bond films, featuring a satisfying mix of great action and memorable characters. It was a huge hit, reinventing Bond for the 90s and helping to ensure that the franchise would continue into the 21st Century.The film succeeds in part because it feels a bit like a Bond ""greatest hits,"" with such OO7 trademarks as the Aston Martin, beautiful women and big action set-pieces all playing a prominent role. Martin Campbell proves himself to be a worthy Bond director, orchestrating the impressive action scenes with great flair, particularly a memorable tank chase through St Petersburg. However, GoldenEye (named after Ian Fleming's home in the Caribbean) also acknowledges the fact that times had changed since OO7's Cold War heyday. Bond finds himself travelling to a newly capitalist Russia, and he also has to deal for the first time with a female M, played wonderfully by Judi Dench, who makes no bones about calling OO7 a ""sexist, misogynous dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War,"" although underneath she already has a sneaking affection for him. There is also a feisty new Miss Moneypenny for Bond to contend with, Samantha Bond replacing Caroline Bliss in the role and making it quite plain that her Moneypenny will be no pushover for OO7. Q, however, is still played by the ageing but sprightly Desmond Llewelyn, and although he is only in one short scene it is a good one, providing another link to Bond's past.Unlike many Bond films, GoldenEye has quite a good plot. It certainly helps that the chief villain is a fellow OO agent, who was once a close friend of Bond's. This set-up adds real spice to the scenes between Bond and Trevelyan, for in OO7's eyes Trevelyan has committed the ultimate sin of betraying both his country and his friend, giving the film a serious edge. Indeed, one of the most welcome features of the film is its lack of schoolboy humour, which the producers might have been tempted to include after the dark Licence to Kill's poor Box Office showing; thankfully they resisted the temptation, and GoldenEye is much the stronger for it. Another plus is the strength of many of the principle characters. Izabella Scorupco is one of the very best Bond girls, proving herself to be a good actress as well as a beautiful one, and her character fits in well with the serious, modern tone of the film by being both quite a realistic character and a skilled computer programmer. Sean Bean is good as Trevelyan, even if his rather forced upper-class accent prevents him from being one of the great villains. Still, he is menacing and his final showdown with Bond is gripping and effective. Stealing the show is Famke Janssen, who is gloriously OTT as the sex-mad henchwoman Xenia Onatopp. Onatopp kills men by crushing them with her legs, and she makes for a classic Bond femme fatale.Then of course there is Pierce Brosnan, who makes a strong debut as OO7. Brosnan was of course invited to become Bond a decade earlier, before his commitments to Remington Steele prevented him from taking the part. Now the Walther PPK was finally his, and he makes the most of it with a performance that nicely blends toughness with humour, and also traces of humanity. In certain scenes Brosnan does a very nice job of portraying the essential loneliness of OO7, and also his fierce loyalty to his country.  In doing so he maintains the welcome seriousness that Dalton brought to the role, but he also comes across as more relaxed and humorous than Dalton, making his Bond a more rounded character in the style of Sean Connery. Arguably, it is the most impressive debut performance of any Bond actor.Naturally, GoldenEye is not perfect. It is a bit too long, and I found Alan Cumming's Boris a rather irritating character, although his eventual comeuppance was very satisfying. Robbie Coltrane's entertaining cameo as a former KGB agent could also have been longer, and I am not a fan of Tina Turner's dreary theme song. These, however, are minor quibbles. GoldenEye is a very entertaining and action-packed film, which captures the essence of Bond and has some real substance too in its plot and characterisation. I would rank it with From Russia with Love, For Your Eyes Only and Licence to Kill as one of the top Bond films, and subsequent Brosnan outings have not yet bettered it.",GoldenEye

It managed to keep the quintessential Bond attributes yet brings the franchise bang up to date in the absence of the Cold War. Brosnan puts in a stellar performance as Bond and the supporting cast including the gritty Sean Bean as the double crossing villain and just the right amount comedy in Joe Don Baker as Jack Wade and Robbie Coltrane as Valentine Zukovsky. Nice nods to the past in the use of the Aston DB5 and mentions of M's predecessors. Even the soundtrack suits the film nicely. There is enough grit and spy content to please the Dalton fans and enough quips and craziness to please the Moore fans. Misses are few and far between - the product placement of the flaccid BMW 1.9 Z3 is poor - it so obviously Un-Bondlike that even the production crew realise and the below par motor barely features in the film at all.

290,Bel Ludovic,Bring back Martin Campbell,8,9 January 2003,"After a hiatus of six years, and with a new Bond and all-round change in personnel, Goldeneye' needed to be good. Fortunately, it succeeds brilliantly, and is far and away and without a shadow of doubt the best Bond film of the Brosnan era. I'm not really a fan of Brosnan  his facial expressions belong to an actor who seems to permanently revel in his own handsomeness, and this would later develop into his style of alternating jaw-clenching over-earnestness with smarmy, glib self-satisfaction  but, unusually given that it's his first outing, it's also his best. Everything else is top notch, too. There's a satisfactory balance between plot development, character development and action; indeed Goldeneye' crackles with sparky, absorbing dialogue, before the sorry deterioration into innuendo overdose seen in later Bond entries  as an example, the legendary `sexist, misogynist dinosaur' interchange between M and Bond is a highlight of the series. Brosnan enjoys good chemistry with Scorupco, the best Bond girl since Barbara Bach way back in '77; Sean Bean is a commendable villain as 006, and the final fight between him and 007 is superbly directed, one of the best fight scenes in the entire series, in which you can really sense the mutual contempt between Bond and his adversary. Ourumov and Onatopp are entertaining henchmen, but Alan Cummings misfires as the computer programmer Boris. Speaking of whom, Goldeneye' is also noteworthy because it marks a measured return to the humour of the 1970s and 80s Bond films after the austere Dalton outings, but  thankfully - on the whole it works well. On the minus side, Bond uses the word `yo!'  and really shouldn't. And Eric Serra's soundtrack is inconsistent, and, at times, quite appalling, although the worst is over after the first twenty minutes. All told, though, Goldeneye' is terrific, easily the most enjoyable Bond film for donkey's years. A shame this standard could not be maintained.",GoldenEye
291,South62,The End,2,4 January 2003,"This movie marks the end of Bond era. Such lack of imagination and dignity is abusive for the most famous serial in motion-picture history. Only high budget, M, Q, Moneypenny, dry Martini and Walter PPK keep the movie Bondlike. Pierce Brosnan does not have Connery charisma, Moore aristocratic charm or Dalton suggestiveness. This is bad sign. Bond has to protect our civilization and he became one of its symbols himself. This Bond is unreliable. Tank scene in St Petersburg is disgusting. (Who really thinks Russians are so so stupid?) Bond has to have comic elements but not the grotesque ones. Brosnan takes everything seriously without ironical distance where Moore was the best. You cannot play Bond seriously because it is not serious itself - it is serial made for fun! Like an old fan I am sad. Maybe I am old-fashioned, maybe this Bond is OK and just follows spirit of 90's. Something is wrong here: Bond or time. Maybe I just hate 90's too much or I have too good intuition.",GoldenEye
292,Joe S.,One of the most underrated films of the Series,9,13 December 1999,"Goldeneye was Bond at its truly edgiest.  Not because the movie has a revenge scheme to it, but because so much was riding on it.  MGM, United Artists, and everyone involved in the Bond series save Connery himself was at risk of going under.  In the words of many a secret agent, failure is not an option.  So comes probably the one of the greatest efforts of the studio in quite awhile.  Brosnan didn't act like the smug, ""I am Bond"" attitude, but did everything he could to do the job right.  And so he did.  The movie was fun, exciting.  The action sequences were bone-jarring, the characters interesting, and please, ladies and gentlemen, the plot wasn't as complicated than at first glance.  It may have been an act of desperation but it was a great one.",GoldenEye
293,loopmyworld,"The best bond movie, with the worst bond.",9,15 September 2010,"The year 1991 Timothy Dalton was making a return for his third venture as 007 for The property of a lady, but copyright issue's declined the make of property of lady. The issue lasted for 5 years, Dalton was about to return for this time, but he didn't the reason United Artist disturbed him a lot by making stupid excuses that he would return as soon possible before his contract expires. At last it ended after 5 years but Timothy's contract expired, & yet it was in the news that his contract would be renewed due to copyright issues lasted tooooo long. But Dalton was totally frustrated this time & he finally announced that he wont return as 007. Many fans were upset with his decision & even me. Pierce Brosnan try's to fit into his shoes in Goldeneye, but he doesn't.In my opinion this the best bond venture till date, strong script, best action sequences. bond girl, gadgets & most important the director Martin Campbell. The writers wrote this movie's script with Timothy Dalton as 007 in their mind, his dark, strong & deadliest part as James Bond, which Pierce toke fully advantage. Hate it!!!!!!! The movie has been directed outstandingly from the opening scene at the dam till the climax. This time 006 as villain gosh what a script, i remember i was just 8 years old when i first saw this movie in theater's actually my first bond movie in theater, didn't understood but i completely enjoyed it. The movie has the best score which is conducted by Eric Serra which many people dislikes it. Strange. Eric Serra brings the modern music with the basic touch of bond theme, specially in the opening sequence when bond is in the Russian chemical factory, the back ground score played that time grips the movie firmly & the plane jump totally thrills me till today. Pierce Brosnan gets the full advantage from the script which was Timothy's originally. It can been seen clearly the image of Timothy as 007 in this movie. The way Pierce walks his looks, the way he dresses up totally shows dark side of Timothy Dalton. If this movie would have done by Timothy Dalton i can bet that he would have done another bond venture & he would have declared the best bond which many people underrated him. The role of leading bond girl Natalya Simonova one of the best bond girls in the bond series, & Miss Onatopp play's her role wonderfully. Sean Bean as 006 does his job perfectly. General Ourumov probably the best Russian general in the entire bond series.Goldeneye was the movie which the fans were waiting for since 5 years. If we look at all the adventures of Pierce Brosnan as James bond leaving Goldeneye aside, Tomorrow never dies didn't stand upto the mark & also the movie was completely nowhere when the rival Titanic was released same time TND was released. Next The world is not enough is said the worst bond movie, lastly Die another day which was totally a remake of Moonraker & mostly Diamonds are forever, which wasn't that good movie too. So only Goldeneye kept Pierce as 007 for the next 3 movies, in which he made a complete mess. A film which belonged to Timothy Dalton will always be his but played by another one.Goldeneye bring back the real bond without the real bond, in fact the worst bond. I wanted to rate this movie 10/10 but i wont, because Timothy Dalton didn't played 007 for this movie as it was his.MY RATING 9/10",GoldenEye
294,Jason-38,An anemic lead cannot salvage a series that is running out of steam.,2,16 January 1999,"There are lite colas, lite beers, and lite cigarettes. Pierce Brosnan is ""Bond-lite."" For those of us who actually saw the early James Bond films with Sean Connery in their original release (beginning with DR. NO in my case), this is a prime example of diminishing returns. For those of us who actually read the original Ian Fleming books, this is just another distortion of Fleming's original character.This film is slickly made, but no amount of camouflage can conceal the fact that Brosnan is wildly miscast as Bond. At best he is warmed over Roger Moore. It's really regrettable that Timothy Dalton could not have continued in the role. In an ideal world, Dalton would have replaced Moore years before he actually assumed the role.Comparisons may be odious, but Dalton really resembled the character that Ian Fleming wrote. He made a concerted effort to play Bond the way that Fleming wrote the character. Brosnan is handicapped by his fundamental unsuitablity for the role. Rather than investing in what Fleming wrote, he settles for an unflappable attitude to danger that is a crashing bore. These points, and the fact that he doesn't look as if he could stand up to a twelve year old boy in a fight, sabotage the film in the last analysis.",GoldenEye
295,Virginia_Farmboy,Best of the Bonds,10,31 January 2007,"Whenever I tell people that my favorite Bond film is Goldeneye, I'm usually told it's because of the video game. That may be part of it, but I'm sure without the game, I would still consider it one of the best. Not only does it have a multitude of great action sequences and set pieces, but it also delivers some humanity into the Bond films. The true nature of 007 is revealed with lines like Natalya's ""How can you be so cold?"" (""It's what keeps me alive.""), M's ""sexist, misogynist dinosaur,"" and Alec's ""I might as well ask if all those vodka martinis silence the screams of all the men you've killed."" Goldeneye is not as explosive as the other three Bond films, perhaps because it was released in an era less populated with such films. This helps the movie. It is not as slow as Dr. No, but less overblown than Die Another Day. Complaints that it uses the Bond theme sparingly are unfounded, because I believe the soundtrack is just fine and when the Bond theme is used, it is used well (the tank chase). It all makes an excellent film. So see Casino Royale, see Goldfinger, but after those, see Goldeneye.",GoldenEye
296,imdbalopexci,The best modern bond film.,8,7 April 2003,Goldeneye had a great story line with a great new bond.  Pierce Brosnan was a great for his first time and he looked like he had been doing it for years.  This was Brosnan's best since he started.  If you don't own it you should because it might be out of print one day.  This movie also had the best girls villains and henchmen.  This would make a great addition to your bond collection and you won't be sorry for getting it.,GoldenEye
297,BNC,just horrible,3,1 September 1998,"GoldenEye is by far the worst Bond movie ever. The villain is weak, his henchmen are silly, and the supporting characters are irritating or ridiculous. The plot is basically a poorly written cross between A View to a Kill and Diamonds are Forever.  Both of those were good, but put their plots together in the same movie and you don't have much.  Don't waste your time with this one.",GoldenEye
298,Jemmy,Plotless fun!,9,19 December 1998,"Okay, so it wasn't exactly *plotless* but there were holes big enough to drive that tank through.  I've seen this movie a number of times, and I did enjoy it immensely, but that could just be because I'm a huge fan of Sean Bean.  But to return to my point, I think the original reason I saw this film so often was to figure out what *why* people did what they did--namely the villain, Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean).  Someone else already pointed out that while the writers did give *some* explanations as to his motivation, they gave both too many and contradicting ones.  And I'm very glad that someone else pointed out that while Bond, as a movie genre, is supposed to be ageless, and presumably all the agents would be, Alec Trevelyan would be in his sixties when the movie opened if he meant what he said about his parents being Cossacks being sent back to Russia.  To return to this villainy, it would also have been swell if someone had finally decided whether Trevelyan was 'evil' before or after the explosion at Arkangel in the opening of the film.  There are conflicting clues to the answer to this, and some definitive answer would be nice. (Even the novelization, which wasn't particularly good, never bothered to answer this.)However, with all those caveats, it was still a good movie.  It was a lot of fun, Natalya made a refreshing love interest, far more interesting than Teri Hatcher in Tomorrow Never Dies, and Xenia, while a bit absurd, was at least interesting enough to poke fun at.  And who could forget the computer nerd played by Alan Cumming?  As for Bond himself, Pierce Brosnan's performance was, to my mind, far more interesting and enjoyable than Timothy Dalton's two movies, or any of Roger Moore's.  All in all, a fun movie, and there is no one who can tell me that the tank ride *through* the horse statue wasn't cool.  (And is it just me and my companions, but didn't the satellite dish coming out of the water look like a giant flushing toilet?)",GoldenEye
299,Koeling,Best out of the Brosnan-Bond trilogy.,8,17 July 2000,Best Bond film and one of the best action films of all time. Brosnan played an excellent 007. Sean Bean was a great bad guy. My nationality is Dutch so I was very excited to see Famke Janssen in it as well. I really loved the end fight between Brosnan and Bean. You didn't see that in the two bond films that followed. It was a great ride. You should own it on video or DVD. 8 out of 10.,GoldenEye
300,bondfan27,"For A Bond Film, It's Pure Gold And Frankly, One Of The Most Stunning Films Ever. * * * * (Out Of Four)",10,1 February 2004,"'GoldenEye' is the perfect Bond film, and in doing so, should be the example of what a Bond film is. After a seven year hiatus from the screen, the series renewed itself in many ways with a new plot, a new beginning, and a new, and better Bond played by Pierce Brosnan. The film shouldn't be looked at as just a Bond film because it holds emotion and an essence not found in other Bond films. Looking at it feels like a sense of seeing it shot in the 50's or 60's and makes it dazzling. While this is supposed to be noticed or not is not the question, because seeing it that way makes the film experience much more accepted. The idea's and characters are so vivid in the film, you feel their pain. There is with no doubt that you will feel emotion surge through you more then once in this film. The hiatus was a good idea for the series, because being away so long built up a stronger return. The film is worth being the example of what a Bond film should be because of what it possess: mainly, everything. The Bond is Pierce Brosnan, which gives Sean a run for his money. The Bond girl is the beautiful Natalia Simonova (Played wonderfully by Izabella Scorupco), a smart, gorgeous, and talented woman. The Bond villain's are evil and unique, including Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) and Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean) who both have their naughty wicked sides to them. The action scenes are first rate, including sky diving to catch an airplane, fights above a satellite, and a car chase through Russia. The dialogue is topnotch, edgy, and fast (""How could you be like this? How could you be so cold?"" ""It's what keeps me alive."") GoldenEye is truly the most polished and creative of the series, and the title of 'Gold' is a perfect fit. For any person of film, 'GoldenEye' is a must-have.* * * * (Out Of Four)A+ (A+ Being The Highest, F Being The Lowest)10 (On The IMDB's Ratings Scale)",GoldenEye
301,Tomus7,Couldn't get past inane opening,2,11 November 2012,"Even by Bond standards, the end of the opening scene - where Bond in free- fall catches up to the plane, climbs in and flies it away to safety - is incredibly stupid.I had heard that this was one of the best Bond films, but I was so put off by this scene that I had to stop watching. This might seem extreme (and you can certainly fault me for rating a movie that I watch so little of) but doesn't this scene imply that the rest of the movie will be total void of reality too?All Bond movies require a certain suspension of disbelief, but there is a limit - past that point something snaps and the whole thing turns into a comic.",GoldenEye
302,pmov,"Pay Attention, 007",8,2 June 2002,"Whilst Sean Connery's interpretation is rightly regarded as the definitive James Bond, GOLDENEYE is worthy of recognition as the movie that dragged what was a tired, bedraggled franchise kicking and screaming into the '90s and it's one of my favourites of the series. Pierce Brosnan gets the chance to show us all why he was producer Cubby Broccolli's preferred choice to replace Roger Moore (Brosnan had to back out in 1986 due to contractual obligations for the TV show Remington Steele) and we finally get a Bond that has the dangerous glint in his eye that so endeared us to Connery in the first place. Brosnan looks good, he moves well and he can deliver those zingers. Sean Connery may not be gone completely from our minds but it's easy to forget him for a couple of hours with Brosnan on-screen.Director Martin Campbell knows exactly where to point the camera for maximum effect and the fast-moving fluidity of the editing gives the whole thing a marvelously kinetic shot in the arm. The action sequences fairly crack along and there's barely time to drawn breath. The late Maurice Binder would probably weep in sorrow if he could see how perfectly Daniel Kleinsman has produced typically Bondian lush visuals to back Tina Turner's terrific rendition of the title song (written by Bono).The story (by Michael France) has a little more depth than usual and the supporting characters are not just stock-in-trade caricatures (Robbie Coltrane's Valentin Zucovsky and Gottfried John's General Ourumov being just two examples). Famke Janssen is delicious and steals every scene she's in as sexually voracious hit-woman, Xenia Onatopp. And whoever thought of casting Judi Dench as M is definitely on to something - she's only in one scene but it's a cracker. My only slight concern is with Sean Bean as the main villain who is outshone by his hench-woman and just isn't in the same league as Blofeld or Goldfinger.It is a sad fact that, during Brosnan's tenure, many of the Bond stalwarts both behind and in front of the camera are now deceased (Cubby Broccolli, Vic Armstrong, Desmond Lewellyn, Maurice Binder to name a few). I guess this is understandable when you consider just how long these films have been going now. CASINO ROYALE (2006), directed again by Campbell and starring Daniel Craig as Bond is the 21st Bond film in a production cycle has been continuing for over 40 years. Let's hope they keep making them as good as this.",GoldenEye
303,nbarlow,by far the best Bond film since the 60s,8,19 March 2005,"From the fantastic bungee jump in the opening sequence, to Robbie Coltrane trying not to smirk as he identifies the sound of the ""Walther P.P.K."", it's obvious that everyone involved in this is having a great time. And that includes the audience.Brosnan brings the suaveness and wit that was lacking from Timothy Dalton's over-serious approach, and a believability that was even more lacking from the campy Roger Moore efforts. The action sequences (particularly the aforementioned opening sequence, the chase in the middle, and the fight at the end) bring the franchise up to the state of the art, the villain is Bond's equal, and both the girls are as hot as hell.It's just a shame that they couldn't keep up the momentum in the rest of the Brosnan films, in particular the invisible-car travesty of Die Another Day.",GoldenEye
304,karlito5,The best of the Bonds,9,12 January 2007,"In his first appearance as 007 Pierce Brosnan gives the best ever performance of James Bond. Brosnan strikes the right balance, in my opinion, between comedy and killing machine.Away from Brosnan's excellent performance Goldeneye has a lot else going from it. The opening sequence is spot on and features the best stunt of the whole series - the bungee jump of the dam.The villains are excellent too, as are the relationships between them, excellent twists ensue as the 006 emerges as the central villain who shows he has no qualms about dispatching his hench men - ensuring tension remains right through the film as you're never quite certain how 006 will react, the scene on the armoured train with Ouromov being a prime example.The quality of the supporting cast is above the usual standard for a Bond film too. Judi Dench is particularly good as the new M - ""the evil queen of numbers"" as she's so brilliantly described.Bond meanwhile seems more like a man-on-a-mission than he does in Brosnan's later efforts, i.e. there's none of that ""we're going to finish this together"" business.Special effects wise Goldeneye is no stunner although it's not really about the gadgets here, the battle between 007 and 006 is the backbone of the film and this is for the best as the intense rivalry between the two 00 agents makes Goldeneye the best of the Bonds",GoldenEye
305,mdilore,An excellent Bond film,8,5 March 2008,"I have been a James Bond fan my whole life and I was disappointed when there was a 6 year pause after License to Kill. I was afraid the Bond generation was over. But then Martin Campbell was able to bring the franchise back with not only a terrific James Bond in Pierce Brosnan, but also a great movie.This movie was terrific in many ways. It has a different plot than the other Bond films in that Bond has to eventually face the truth that his enemy is a former MI6 agent. Never done in previous films. This was truly a great idea. Sean Bean was a great choice for this evil character. There is great acting in each character, stupendous suspense, and wonderful action sequences.Does anyone realize that Martin Campbell introduced both Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig? He seems to be born to direct Bond films. I do hope he returns to direct another in the future.",GoldenEye

It was a decent popcorn flick, but it could have been so much better.The first ten minutes were full of charged, tense, dynamic action sequences and brilliant stunts. But after Bond escaped the first dangerous scenario, the plot seemed to just amble along for the next hour. By the time it finally picked up again, it was too late for it to really be a really outstanding action movie.I would recommend seeing it if you are either a Bond fan, or a really big action movie fan, but otherwise, you will probably not enjoy it all that much.",GoldenEye

You can watch this movie without caring about James Bond and probably get a lot out of it. Pierce Brosnan is great in the role of James Bond. The bond girl is decent. This movie has a great cast of villains, arguably some of the better ones in this series. The action is also great. When this movie came out, it had the fastest and most intense action in the whole series. The only aspect that seems to be a little disappointing is the music. The credits song is pretty boring and while there is plenty of good music to accompany the action, some of it just feels out of place. Overall, definitely give this movie a shot if you just want a fun action movie.",GoldenEye

It's one of my favourite games, so I had very high expectations of  the movie but I was a little bit disappointed. The acting is poor (Brosnan is obviously only able to portray two facial expressions), the story is quite unbelievable (the motives of Traveylean are implausible), the quality of the special effects, for example the aero crash of the the MiG's in Serjenawa, is very bad. Altogether, GoldenEye is not so bad, but I suppose it would have been better, if they had first made the game and then created the movie.Evaluation 6/10",GoldenEye
310,stephengward,"You Know The Name, You Know The Number....",10,24 March 2000,"Pierce Brosnan begins what I hope will be a very long association with James Bond in Martin Campbell's ""Goldeneye"". However, its good but not great. The movie is shamelessly commercial (something that increases in subsequent movies) product placement is far too high on the agenda! The pre-title sequence is spectacular but perhaps too far fetched even for a Bond movie! Brosnan combines the many great attributes of ""Connery"" with the wit and charm of ""Moore"". Here he interprets Bond with a characterisation that is both commanding and refreshing after the ""Dalton"" era. The trouble with the film is that it promised so much but delivered very little. Alright, there are some of the most stunning action scenes yet to be filmed in a Bond to be found here. Nevertheless, it lacks a certain something. In many ways it reminds me greatly of ""Dr No"" the first Bond film made in 1962. Goldeneye is the rebirth of the Bond franchise. Not since the sixties had 007 caused quite a stir. I think one of the biggest reasons I don't get that ""Bond feeling"" from Goldeneye is largely due to Eric Serra's woefully poor soundtrack. It's simply awful. Electronic sounds substitute the classy brass sound given to Bond by ""John Barry"".  Tina Turner provides an adequate title track, but not since ""A View To A Kill"" have we heard a truly great Bond song. Sean Bean dumps his heavy Yorkshire burr in favour of a typical English upper class accent in order to play baddie ""Alec Trevelyan"". Scottish born ""Robbie Coltrane"" does likewise in order to play the Russian, ""Valentin"". In fact I'm pretty sure there's not one native Russian in the film. A pity really since the Russians hadn't been the enemy for a number of films prior to this one. For me its difficult to accept such well known British actors with accents other then their own. Brosnan returns two years later in the superior ""Tomorrow Never Dies - 1997"".",GoldenEye

What a bond girl Natalya is my favorite by far not just a beautiful women but a well crafted character with brawn.

313,NS_writings,One of the greatest movies of all time,10,27 May 2021,"When I name GOLDENEYE as one of the greatest movies of all time (I said ""movies of all time"", not just ""Bond movies of all time"") I get some laughs and disapproving looks. I am supposed to say CITIZEN KANE or NORTH BY NORTHWEST or CASABLANCA or those films that were considered ""among the greatests"". Same goes with the Bond genre: is it just a passionate thing that I consider the first Bond movie I ever watched on that far and away summer of 1998 on TV with mom and dad in my top five of all the movies I ever watched? Well, probably, but that doesn't means that my preference for GOLDENEYE is not also professional and objective.It was Pierce Brosnan's debut as James Bond after a six year and a half hiatus in the series and also director Martin Campbell's first Bond movie (he and most of his talented crew came back in CASINO ROYALE). Brosnan was the Bond of my childhood, the Bond of a generation. Probably the Dalton and Craig fans consider him weak, but his ""action hero"" portrayal was not a personal decision but a production decision: after audiences didn't approve the tough LICENCE TO KILL, it was time for a fresh and more relaxed Bond adventure in which the hero would triumph and beat everyone. A Bond that could wear a three piece Brioni tuxedo in the Monte Carlo casino with the same elegance as the green combat gear he wears in the Cuban jungle during the climax. Brosnan shares the best qualities of his predecessors: Connery's toughness, Lazenby's mood for romance, Moore's humour and Dalton's dramatic antics.Famke Janssen plays the deadliest and most gorgeous assassin you'll ever see and Izabella Scorupco does the part of the good girl, who is a vital part in Bond's attempt to foil the villain's plan. Needless to say Sean Bean plays one of the best villains in the Bond's rogue gallery: evil, deadly, sarcastic, vengeful and greedy. Supporting the cast is Gottfried John as General Ourumov, a former Soviet military enemy of Bond that has found a place in the pocket of the arms dealer of the new Russia, and Alan Cumming as Boris Grishenko, a character that reminds us we are firmly in the 1990s.The movie, basically, deals with the fall of the Soviet Union and how this historical fact affects both Bond (who is still loyal to the Queen and Country) and his enemy who mocks his outdated loyalty. How friends became enemies and enemies became friends. I strongly recommend you to read John Gardner's novelization which is more detailed on this subject.Martin Campbell and his troupe make this film tidy, thrilling and visually appealing: DP Phil Méheux, editor Terry Rawlings, and veteran Bond production designer Peter Lamont - all together showcasing the beauty of the Cuban beaches (shot in Puerto Rico, actually) and the coldness of a Russian GRU cell. Not to mention the bombastic Tina Turner theme song played over Daniel Kleinman's colorful main title sequence in which beautiful girls with hammers tear down communist statues. And there's also Eric Serra's soundtrack, terribly hated by fans. But I like it. And, in my opinion, suits the film very well as his romantic end title song 'The Experience of Love'.I don't really know what the world considers a classic. Is a 26-year-old movie a classic? Is it good enough to be considered a classic Bond film, or a classic action/adventure film, or a classic film? In my book, yes, it is!",GoldenEye
314,chelb,"A mildly above average Bond movie, yet good as a movie in general...",6,16 December 2001,"This is the 19th of 22 James Bond movies (2 being unofficial Bond movies and one currently and still in production).  This was the first Bond movie that Pierce Brosnan was in as the 5th actor to play James Bond. This movie rates, for me, as a slightly above average Bond movie and I gave it a 6 out of 10 overall.  Special effects were good but the plot dragged alot throughout the movie.  The Polish female lead actress, Izabella Scorupco, plays a Russian computer programmer.  She is a good actress but her character was developed very little.  There are some long and slow pauses throughout the movie that could have been edited better.  Action was not creative alot of times and consisted of just firing alot of bullets from machine guns.  There is a terrific army tank chase in the movie, however. Some of the scenery was fantastic like the huge dam at the beginning of the movie.  The villain was good but also not developed very much and repeated his life history several times in the movie.  The movie was a bit too slow for a Bond film.  Brosnan did a great job as Bond.  Action is a 3.75, Female lead is a 4, plot is a 5, music is a 6, scenery is an 8, overall suspense is a 6.  Female villain accomplice is a 9. The teaser has Bond and agent 006 break into a Russian chemical facility which is part of a huge dam.  They blow the facility up and kill alot of Russian soldiers and 007 gets away on an aircraft that he chases off a mountain and dives to get inside of, this after throwing the pilot and himself off the aircraft earlier while it is taking off and chasing it on a motorcycle.  It is believed that 006 is killed during the teaser.The movie itself involves Bond tracking down people who stole a special helicopter and Goldeneye which is a special optic device used to fire off Soviet era Electromagnetic Pulse satellites which disable an entire city's electrical systems, electronics, and computers.  Bond must stop this from happening.  A modestly above average movie.  Kind of boring at times.",GoldenEye
315,yihdzelonh,A stylistic return to the true spirit of Bond films.,8,21 December 2016,"Goldeneye -the first Bond installment of the 90s and with newcomer Pierce Brosnan- is something of a return of the 70s-style Roger Moore James Bond films: The action and stunts and explosions are more stylistic -if not slightly more unrealistic- the plot and dialog is not overtly complicated and unintelligible, which makes for a much more 'accessible' James Bond movie than...say...Sean O' Connery and Timothy Dalton Bond movies... and a more humorous and 'cool' and likable type of Bond (Roger Moore-'esque') is introduced with Brosnan.In a previous review of Timothy Dalton's last movie, I stated that Dalton was vastly underrated and probably the 'quintessential' James Bond of all Bond actors. It is very lastimable that Dalton starred in only two films. He had a very subdued and quiet intelligence, had the 'perfect' looks and actions for a James Bond, and was just 'coming into his own' when the series took a hiatus for about 6 years or so.After a 're-visiting' of Pierce Brosnan's introduction in Goldeneye, I believe that I am still conflicted -not 100% certain- that Dalton is a more 'perfect' Bond than Brosnan: Brosnan has a humor, and extreme 'coolness,' likability, and confidence about him that is not equaled by any other Bond -be it Dalton, Moore, O'Connery, or Daniel Craig. Pierce Brosnan is -as I first remembered him- very, very cool and seems supremely confident and adept at hand-to-hand combat, running, jumping, leaping, and very quickly accurately aiming any kind of weaponry at his disposal. Perhaps the 'perfect' quintessential James Bond is a cross between Dalton and Brosnan. I believe it's a 'tie' between them both.Goldeneye is everything a James Bond movie should be like: techno-gadgetry, awesome stunts, awesome explosions, and a very cool Bond. Even the Scottish actor, Alan Cumming, gives a very realistic performance as a bona fide Russian.",GoldenEye

319,veronicapranjic,A big comeback,10,2 May 2015,"GoldenEye saved James Bond. After a six-year hiatus Bond was back. And what a comeback that was.This movie gave as a great twist in a villain- Bond's friend,agent 006 who faked his death nine year prior. The character of Alec is so cleverly constructed that he just might be the best Bond villain. His parents were Lienz kozaks and Stallin executed them in WW2 second. With that he wants to justify his plan- robbing the Bank of England and the firing secret weapon called GoldenEye that was made during the Cold War. Bond even says how he just wants to justify a common bank robbery with his trauma from childhood. This movie also analyzes the character of James Bond. From M(played brilliantly by Judi Dench) to the Bond girl Natalya Simjonova to the 006 himself. ""Oh spare me the Freud James. I could ask you if all those vodka martinis ever silence the screams of all the men you've killed. Do you find the forgivness in the arms of all those willing women-for all the dead ones you failed to protect"". It's a brilliant line spoken by a great villain played by the great Sean Bean. It's brilliant. And so is this movie. And I can't just pass this and not mention James Bond himself. Pierce Brosnan-the man who was nailed as the ideal Bond ever since Remington Steele. And rightfully so. He has everything Bond needs to have. The man IS Bond. He is the first one I ever saw and he will always be my favourite and the best for me.

From my understanding, the part was written for Timothy Dalton but it wasn't meant to be. Pierce Brosnan rejuvenates, James Bond in his first outing as the British spy, and I believe it was right time for him to take on the mantle.Sean Bean was the perfect fit for his role. His character is wicked and devious. Watching this at the time sent shivers down my spine, as I was used to seeing the cheesiness in other Bond films.If you want to see 007 at his best, you will definitely experience it here.",GoldenEye
324,tarll,best villain,9,16 November 2004,"This is probably my favorite of Brosnan's Bond work, and one of the best of the series. While it still follows the formula it is faster paced than most of the Moore films and returns Bond to a harder edge while maintaining the humor. What really makes this film, however, is the presence of Judi Dench as M, giving a whole dynamic to Bond's relationship to his superiors, and of Sean Bean, easily one of the best Bond villains. I read once that a hero is defined by the quality of his opponent, and Bean was one of the best in the series, behind only Blofeld and Goldfinger. If I have one complaint of this, or any of Brosnan's work, it's that his bond tends to be in Rambo mode a bit to often. Bond, to me, works with a pistol and his brains, not with an endless supply of machine guns.",GoldenEye

326,Yvette92,A New Bond with a New Style,9,14 September 2009,"James Bond changed for a fifth time with this, the 17th official Bond film, emulating the venerable Dr. Who once again. Fans welcomed the change from Timothy Dalton to Pierce Brosnan, and they vaulted this movie to the highest grossing Bond movie at that time. Brosnan made Bond more suave and sophisticated than Dalton's Bond, with a dash more humor, though less humor than Roger Moore's Bond. It helped that this movie featured non-stop action and a foe with malice toward England in his heart, and the ability to execute a nefarious plot. In the opening scenes of this movie we see a breath-taking stunt, as Bond, well his double actually, leaps off the side of a dam on a bungee cord. Bond is penetrating a secret Soviet chemical weapons facility. We learn that Bond is on this mission with Alec Trevelyan, Agent 006 (Sean Bean). Unfortunately it appears that Alec does not survive an encounter with General Arkady Ourumov (Gottfried John). After a daring escape involving multiple close calls, the movie forwards into the present to the Mediterranean. Bond encounters Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and she is behaving in a most unusual fashion. Of course, Bond may have been attracted to her because of her incredible beauty, but regardless of the reason, she has gained Bond's interest. We soon observe that Xenia is a most cruel person, and she is ruthless in stealing a super secret helicopter that is resistance to electromagnetic pulses, such as a nuclear weapon might cause. We now move to Severnaya, Russia, where the helicopter has been spotted by satellite. We have the benefit of going into Severnaya as General Ourumov and sadistic sidekick Onatopp enter the facility and demand an inspection of the Goldeneye system. It seems that during the cold war the Soviet Union had developed an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapon, Goldeneye, which was capable of wreaking all sorts of havoc on any electronic equipment in the weapon's aim. Unfortunately for the personnel of Severnaya, once General Ourumov obtains the control module he has Xenia eliminate the staff of Severnaya. However, one member of the staff, Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), has survived Xenia and the activation of the first of two Goldeneye satellites. M (Judi Dench) sends Bond to Russia to find out what is going on. Bond soon meets with former foe Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane), who gives him some clues that might lead Bond to the information he seeks. As a side note, Minnie Driver has a brief role as Irina, Zukovsky's tone deaf mistress. While Bond has been tracking down Ourumov, Natalya has been tracking former Severnaya associate Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming). After a surprised Bond encounters Alec, he awakes to the yells of Natalya, and quickly learns that they are in the cockpit of super secret helicopter, and missiles have been programmed to fire and destroy the helicopter. After a typically close call, Bond and Natalya soon end up in the hands of Ourumov and Alec once again. The ever-resourceful Bond escapes, of course, in one of the best chase scenes of all time. The action speeds onward to a hidden satellite dish, which looks remarkably like the observatory at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Okay, I am kidding, it really is Arecibo, except when it is a model. The action intensifies toward the exciting conclusion that takes place under, around and on the huge radio telescope facility. This Bond movie is as good as you might think it is. We hungered for a new Bond film in the six years between the release of ""License to Kill"" in 1989, and the release of this film in 1995. The world had changed a lot in that time. The Soviet Union was gone, and the nature of Bond villains changed as well. As a point of trivia, this Bond marked the first time a Bond movie actually filmed in the former Soviet Union. You can tell the style of this movie a little by the nomination for Saturn Awards this movie received for Best Action/Adventure Film and Best Actor by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films (USA). The movie was nominated for a couple of other awards, and won a BMI award for music and a Golden Screen award (Germany). Pierce Brosnan occasionally looks slightly uncomfortable as Bond, but he quickly makes Bond his own. By the end of the movie I was comfortable that Brosnan made a suitable James Bond, and was already looking forward to the next Bond film. I recommend this movie highly to fans of the James Bond series and for fans of action-adventure movies. This movie is a winner and a keeper.",GoldenEye

330,thatgingerguy88,The Best Bond!!!,9,12 December 2006,"I have seen all of the Bond films, and this one by far is the best. Goldeneye had all of the elements that made the original Bonds such compelling movies, and than a million times more action. Next to Connery, Pierce Brosnan is the best actor to have stepped into this role, and in my opinion he may even be better than Connery's Bond. Pierce Brosnan single handedly rejuvenated this franchise. The Bond girls were sexy (as they should have been), although Xenia Onnatop may have been a bit ""over the top"". Nonetheless great action movie, my favourite Bond movie of all time, and its sad that Brosnan was unable to top his debut in any of his other Bond performances.",GoldenEye

The movies is close to being a parody of Bond, unfortunately not the last time this can be said of one of the Brosnan versions - re Die Another Day.

This is probably one of two of my favorites James Bonds movie and usually I don't like James Bond movies. Goldeneye has a unique story to it, with a villain that's either insane or just driven by the need for revenge. Bronsan does a good job as Bond, pulling the charm and calmness of this 007 agent. The actress who played his love interest (am sorry for the actress thing but for the love of god I can't figure out of to spell her name) was a good character. Spunky. Famke Jensen was good as Xena, the beautiful but deadly assassin. Alan Cumming was good as the little worm, completely full of himself. Bean also pulled of a wonderful job, as the villain Alec a.k.a 006, the former agent. It was a good movie, though some of it's impossible plot twists. The thing I loved most about this movie was the song at the beginning ""Goldeneye"" by Tina Turner. What a cool song.",GoldenEye
333,acwal,"Not only my favourite James Bond film, but one of my all time favourite 90's films..",9,10 November 2017,"By the early 1990s, James Bond had been missing off the big screen since 1989's LICENCE TO KILL (which I reviewed in an early retrospective), due to legal difficulties and with films such as DIE HARD and TRUE LIES, many thought that 007 was a relic of the past, however in 1994 when it was announced that Timothy Dalton had left the role of 007 after two films, they announced the new Bond in the form of Pierce Brosnan and hype culminated into 1995's Goldeneye.The story has James Bond investigating the theft of a EMP satellite and the deaths of a Russian tech facility by a Russian crime syndicate by the codename 'Janus', teaming up with lone survivor Natalya Simonova (Played by the excellent Isabella Scorupco) He learns that the leader is presumed deceased MI6 agent Alec Trevelyan (played with relish by Sean Bean) Bond must destroy the satellite whilst trying to escape the thighs of the psychotic Xenia Onatopp (X Men's Famke Jansen)Pierce Brosnan makes a great 007, combining the humour of Roger Moore, the dryness of Connery and the vulnerability of Lazenby and Dalton, he has the right blend for the role.However the films main weakness is its infamous score composed by Eric Serra, which drives to far from the orchestral format of John Barry's score and relies on 90s synthesizers, the score is decent, Although the less said about the end credits song 'The Experience Of Love',the better Tina Turner sings the films theme song, the song is catchy and has a Shirley Bassey vibe, but is decent at best.Goldeneye brought Bond into the 1990s and spawned three more follow ups with Brosnan, as well as a fantastic game for the N64, All in all, Goldeneye is not only my favourite James Bond film, but one of my all time favourite standalone action films.",GoldenEye
334,Chris_Lacon,"Whist not quite as timeless as the classic Bond's, ""GoldenEye"" is a slick, entertaining film and an assured debut for Brosnan.",7,15 October 2017,"James Bond: The world's most adaptable secret agent. In 2006, Daniel Craig and director Martin Campbell gave us ""Casino Royale"" which resurrected the ailing franchise and made it fresh and relevant once again in the post 9/11 world. Campbell however successfully revitalised the Bond franchise once before with Pierce Brosnan's 1995 debut ""GoldenEye"". Back then, the Bond series was in a crisis. The world had changed: The Soviet Union had collapsed and audience's taste's had shifted towards big, blockbuster action movies, like the various Stallone and Schwarzenegger vehicles being produced. Bond was increasingly seen as archaic and outdated. MGM, the company that produced the franchise, was mired in financial difficulties and eventually in 1994, Timothy Dalton officially resigned from the role. It seemed increasingly that Bond's relevance and appeal had ended with the Cold War.Campbell however, managed to successfully reinvent the franchise and make it relevant again for the post Cold War world. Much like he would do eleven years later with ""Casino Royale"", Campbell took clear inspiration from the new generation of action films and applied them to the Bond franchise. As a result ""GoldenEye"" is a slicker, faster paced film than its predecessors. Boasting an impressive array of action set pieces, the opening scene, for example, which depicts Bond bungee jumping from the top of a Soviet dam, is one of the best openings to a film that I have seen and the now famous Tank chase though Saint Petersburg is now considered a classic Bond moment,. The film does retain some of the grit of Dalton's two films, whist having something of an ironic and self deprecating sense about itself. On the downside, the film has noticeably dated in the two decades since its release and several of the aspects that made the film entertaining and appealing in the 1990's, now make it look archaic, especially when compared to Craig's recent outings. The film's various jabs poking fun at Bond's post Cold War relevance can also begin to feel tiresome after a while.In his debut outing, Brosnan aquatints himself well, bringing a smooth charm and his natural charisma to the role. Brosnan's Bond has the glib charm and off the cuff humour of the late Roger Moore and occasionally shows hints of Connery and Dalton's ruthlessness. Whist Brosnan is the most emotionally expressive of the actor's who have played Bond, he plays it subtly. An example would be the beach scene in Cuba: He makes it clear to Natalya, that killing Trevelyan is part of his occupation, but he is clearly conflicted about it on the inside. Whist Brosnan does bring a youthful vigour to the role, this is a double edged sword in a way, as his baby faced features, somewhat undermine the fact he is supposed to be a ruthless assassin. In fact, I would say it wasn't until 1999's ""The World Is Not Enough"" that Brosnan grew into the role physically. Nevertheless, Bronson handles the action scenes with ease, especially the final fight with Trevelyan, which hearkens back to the train fight in ""From Russia With Love"". Regardless, I would say that aside a few minor detractors ""GoldenEye"" is overall, a strong debut from Brosnan.Sean Bean plays the main antagonist: rogue MI6 agent Alec Trevelyan. In keeping with the influence of contemporary action films on the revitalised Bond series, Bean's Trevelyan has less in common with Blofeld or Goldfinger, having a more personal and interesting motive then simple greed or lust for world domination. Making the character, a former friend of 007's also adds a layer of complexity to the film, as this makes him a considerably more personal foe for Bond. Trevelyan is something of a dark mirror to Bond himself, which allows him to, like many characters, subvert and smarmily comment on many of the tropes associated with the Bond series.The main female leads of the film, Janssen's seductive assassin, Xenia Onnatopp and Scorupco's computer programmer, Natayla Simonova, also both conform and subvert our expectation of Bond girls. Onnatop, like Trevelyan, is a dark mirror image of Bond, using his love of sex and beautiful women against him, whereas Simonova is the more straightforward love interest. Neither characters have any real predecessors in the franchise and both reflect the changing world and attitudes that Bond finds himself in. Onnatopp is by far one of the more memorable Bond villainesses due to her rather unique method of killing people, although at times, the character does seem a little too over the top. Simonova, on the other hand, is a considerably more believable Bond girl, and although certainly spunky and assertive, can come across as dowdy and bland, especially compared to Janssen's sultry henchwoman. Ample support also comes from the supporting cast, with Robbie Coltrane and Alan Cumming providing comic relief as a Russian gangster with a grudge against Bond and a sleazy treasonous computer hacker respectively.""GoldenEye"" is undoubtedly a fairly strong film, however problems with pacing, several plot holes and the fact the film is beginning to show its age, detract from it somewhat. The pacing, especially in the second act of the film, bogs the film down with heavy expositional scenes, especially the conversations between Bond and Coltrane's mobster where they discuss ""Janus's"" backstory. The model effects used in the film, only slightly convincing back in 1995, now look noticeably dated. The fact that many of the characters comment on Bonds seeming irrelevance following the Cold War doesn't help either as they place the film firmly in the mid 1990's.Overall, I would say ""GoldenEye"" is one of the better entries in the series and undoubtedly the best film of Brosnan's tenure. Whist not as timeless as the classic Bond's, ""GoldenEye"" is still, for the large part, confident enough to stand on its own merits, and is a strong debut picture for Brosnan.",GoldenEye

Having Bond face his near equal is a terrific plot, and I thoroughly enjoy it every time I watch it.  Many people say that this was a disappointing movie, and the only disappointing aspect I find is the score by Eric Serra.  He massacred the sanctity of our beloved Bond Theme.  I prefer David Arnold's score from Tomorrow Never Dies 10 times more than Goldeneye.  I think that is the only major flaw in Goldeneye.  The stunts are terrifically thought out and performed, though many call the plane stunt in the pre-credits sequence unreal or impossible, yet they forget this is James Bond.  James Bond is a fantasy, and not all of the things are real.  James Bond movies take the world we live in and twist it a bit to make a great movie.  Take for instance Moonraker.  In Moonraker, they take advantage of the new space shuttles in the movie.  There are factual inconsistencies such as the fact that NASA could not launch a space shuttle just like that.  It takes major preparation to launch just one space shuttle, which includes combing the road where the space shuttle is taken down to the launching pad, test firings and numerous hours of training.  Even with this, they require a launch window, which I doubt would just happen to be there.  My point is, many things in Bond flicks are not total reality, but based on it, and that is why we love the films.  I give this movie a 10.",GoldenEye
337,P Baker,Even action films can be improved with good acting.,7,20 February 1999,"This was one of the best 007 films in years, and one of my favorites.  The opening scenes- diving off a cliff to catch a pilotless plane, followed by the crude seduction of 007's evaluator- made me squirm, but it improved dramatically from there.  The tank chase through St. Petersburg (?) was terrific, and nearly believeable.I particularly liked the new supporting cast; Samantha Bond as a snappy Miss Moneypenny, Joe Don Baker, recycled from a villian in an earlier 007 film (The Living Daylights) as the smart-alec CIA liaison, and Judi Dench as a brass-balled (or something) M.  And they kept the best one of all, Desmond Llewelyn as the acerbic Q.  Izabella Scorupco, the female lead, almost convinced me she was Russian, and I liked the strong character she played. As for Pierce Brosnan, I think he struck about the right note as an essentially honorable and charming man who was nonetheless capable of ruthlessness, and who reveled in his political incorrectness.I like films in which the director spends as much care on the supporting actors as on the lead, and it improves even an action film no end.

The storyline and villian were the best of any Bond film to date (admit it, Blofeld was just ridiculous after a while).  Brosnan's portrayal of Bond is marvelous, the lines ""Bond, James Bond,"" and ""Vodka martini, shaken, not stirred,"" roll of his tongue like he was born to say them.  Connery's tux has been very effectively filled, though certainly not replaced.Goldeneye is like a cold breeze in the desert, its refreshing.

However the star of the show for me has to be sean bean, possibly with the best performance of a bond villain i have ever seen. Bean plays not just a megalomaniac who wants to take over the world, but plays his villain with more depth, someone who was deeply scarred in his childhood. The on screen chemistry between brosnan and bean is unbelievable, suggesting that they do indeed not only hate each other, but were also friends in the past. Watch out for the final confrontation between bond and bean on the cradle, best finale in a movie for a long timeLasty credit needs to go to the director martin campbell, who i think is a brilliant director (did zorro and casino royale)Its a shame brosnans other bond films could not keep up to this standard",GoldenEye

He had the eye of Bond producers even before that, and he fit the role better than anyone other than Connery. The rest of the cast is superb, especially Famke Janssen, my favorite actress ever.

An attack on a remote satellite outpost occurs in Russia using the stolen helicopter, and Bond soon realizes that someone from his past may be involved.There is much more to the story, and a lot less cliché than my little synopsis may appear.

I even loved the self awareness the film had of the first female M, and her character is straight up and not afraid to speak her mind (""If you think for one moment I don't have the balls to send a man out to die, your instincts are dead wrong."")The music is also something that captures my attention. I have a deep love of music and at times, people get annoyed with me for pointing out pieces of the soundtrack that I find to be interesting. Composed by Eric Serra (credits include ""Leon: The Professional"" and ""The Fifth Element""), he brings a different take to the music of 007. I've read that many people were displeased with the soundtrack, which I CAN understand as it's different, but I wholeheartedly disagree with. The music has a very strong militarism type sound which fits perfect with the tone of the film.While composers such as John Barry and David Arnold have both done a fantastic job (I own 007 soundtracks from both composers and listen to them often), I find Eric Serra's soundtrack to be my own favorite. He has a certain distinct sound that he uses, much like any composer would such as John Williams. But enough about the music, lets look at Brosnan as Bond.I feel that this film, along with Tomorrow Never Dies, is Peirce Brosnan's crowning achievement. I have always have had a somewhat controversial viewpoint of Brosnan being the one of the best actors to portray the dark and mysterious Bond, even beating out Connery as Bond (and creating even MORE controversy by believing Daniel Craig was even better, but I'll save that for my Casino Royale review). I always felt that Peirce Brosnan was MEANT as Bond, especially after seeing his performance as the titular character in the 80's TV show ""Remington Steele.""This is why the film ranks up there for me, I loved pretty much every aspect of the film and is one that I tend to watch over and over.",GoldenEye

352,f-conklin,Decent bond,6,11 February 2012,"Bond is back and better than ever. OK, he may not be better than ever but he's better than he's been in some time. GoldenEye has a great opening scene that is more entertaining than most entire movies. It involves bungee jumping, guns, motorcycles, planes, and nerve gas among other things. Pierce Brosnan's first effort as Bond is a remarkable one. The movie has good acting, good action, and humor. It's great escapism from start to finish. The women are beautiful and Famke Jannsen and Sean Bean play their roles well. GoldenEye also boasts one of the best finales of the series in which Bond must take on the villain atop a gigantic satellite dish. As stated earlier, Brosnan is terrific as Bond. He's suave, witty, charming, looks good in a suit, and has a capacity for action. In conclusion, this is a thrilling Bond from start to finish and should not be missed. Out of 4 stars - 3.5",GoldenEye
353,98nurdinm,Pretty good return,7,14 July 2004,"I have a friend who honestly believes this to be the greatest Bond movie ever made. And for the most part, i agree with him.The problem with bringing a literature character such as James Bond into the '90s is that he is a Cold War figure. With the collapse of communism, it seemed that the Bond franchise had collapsed as well.However this is where the similarities begin. The writers of 'GoldenEye' seem to have borrowed heavily from the Cold War itself. Thisproves to be a winning formula. The subtle mix of Cold War fears and the new-age fears of global terrorism are brilliantly combined to create a great storyline.Pierce Brosnan looks confident to begin with, and after a few shaky moments manages to make the character his own. Famke Janssenn is a wonderful femme fatal, while on the side of good, Issabella Scoripcuo is extremely talented, though not the most attractive of Bond girls.Good comic relief came from Robbie Coltrane, Alan Cumming ('I am invincible!') and Joe Don Baker.However, being a dedicated Bond fan, i always have to find something wrong with one of the areas. For this film the music stinks. Apart from the wicked opening theme song, with Tina Turner sounding like a new-age Shirley Bassey, Eric Serra's score is disappointing and lacking of any memorable tune.It's not the best Bond film ever, but it's a pretty good try!",GoldenEye

355,adjorgkilu,THIS is how you reboot a franchise!,9,6 July 2007,"After the (justified) flop of Timothy Dalton's License To Kill, the Bond franchise seemed to be nearing its end. Bond had become ""just another action hero"", but people looking for generic action and personal revenge plots were sticking to the Arnold, Bronson, Seagal, etc. films. So the producers wisely decided to make Bond a sophisticated spy again, and the result was a brilliant film that stands near the top of the series. The best thing about this ""reboot"" is that it looks into the future but, unlike the recent Casino Royale, also respects the past. Therefore, the film can be enjoyed equally by longtime Bond fans AND by newcomers. Pierce Brosnan makes a remarkable debut as Bond, the women - both good and bad - are very sexy, and the villains are terrific. The film is funny, exciting, romantic, glamorous, fast-paced, over-the-top and down-to-earth at the same time. In short, it's everything a Bond film needs to be.",GoldenEye

357,GoldeneyeQuinn,"The best plot, the best characters, the best BOND!",10,24 July 2006,"I remember when I first saw Goldeneye when I was just five years old or so. I remember loving it even though I didn't really understand it at all. Now I'm almost sixteen years old and I'm a hardcore James Bond fan. I've seen all the James Bond movies, and also own them all. Goldeneye to me is something special, it is the most complete James Bond movie. Even though it is Pierce Brosnan's first outing as Bond to me it is his best. The villains are all very cool, and stand out among other ones of the series. Alec is my favorite Bond villain, because he has the most depth as a person, he is so similar to Bond, and yet completely the opposite. His parents died just like Bond's, and he is a 00-agent in the beginning of the film just like Bond. The other villains are good too. Onatopp is a great female villain with a strange method of assassination ""unsafe sex."" The action in the movie is well done, and brings back memories of the past old-school style of the Bond films. There is a perfect amount of action in Goldeneye, and it does not start till the middle, like the old films. One of my favorite, and possibly the most memorable things about Goldeneye is the musical score. It is by far the most unique in the series, and has a really dark kind of mood, which fits the movie very well. The Bond girl in the film is not the best in the series, but does not do anything bad spoil the movie. She is still hot, and a good actress though. Overall I give it ten out of ten. Goldeneye is the last film to capture the old style of James Bond, that we Bond fans love to watch, and that movie makers have stopped doing. This is the kind of Bond I want Casino Royale to be.",GoldenEye

Nobody really cares who dies and who ends up in bed with our ""hero"".What do we get besides stunning unbelievable stunts? A stupid Disneyland ""hacker"" because the audience is considered too stupid to know about how real hacking works. A female Secret Service chief that makes you wanna scream or throw your remote out of the window. A disgusting Russian domina killer - at least she had a fitting death.Overall an OK film to kill some time, but certainly not a DVD that I would be too sad about if it got scratched.

360,egogo-1,Most spectacular and senseless Bond ever,6,30 August 2010,"From the opening bungee jump down a dam, through the tank chase and train collision to the finale this contains the most grandiose stunts in any Bond ever. I guess that is easy to do if the plot is untrammelled by any need to make sense. This film is full of head scratching moments which just make you say ""WTF?"" For instance, after the spectacular opening dive, Bond breaks into a secret hideout only to meet another agent who is already there, but it is not explained how. There are other anomalies in this opening which cannot be expressed here so as to not give away the plot. At another point, the tank which Bond has been driving sees a train speeding away and then we see the tank has managed to get ahead of it? These details should have been ironed out in the script.

362,MAHHockey,Best Bond movie of the Pierce Brosnan era,7,8 June 2003,"*Some mild character spoiler info*While not the best Bond movie ever, it is certainly the best one staring Pierce Brosnan.  This one has a certain style and coolness to it that the latest three are completely lacking.Sean Bean works reasonably well as the agent turned villain.  I also like the fact that Sean Bean is one of the few villains that has a computer programmer working for him instead of a muscle bound oaf henchman. Gottfried John also plays the part of General Ourumov very well
The two main female roles were well cast, another advantage over the newest three movies.  Izabella Scorupco is actually slightly believable as another computer programmer, while still being rather attractive (I can't look at Denise Richards anymore without thinking ""she was supposed to be a nuclear physicist?"").  Famke Jansen's character was a little over the top, but she still pulled it off nicely.This movie has a very sharp sense of humor, again blowing the latest three out of the water.  The brief scene where we meet Valentin still makes me laugh (interesting cameo by Minnie Driver).  Brosnan has many funny and well timed one liners throughout the movie.",GoldenEye

364,vicentekewley,The best Brosnan Bond film to date!,8,8 April 2005,"In my opinion this is the best Brosnan Bond film to date. However, this does not make it the best Bond film ever. It is a refreshing change from Moores and Daltons versions of Bond, which were not as good as Connery's in my opinion, and Brosnan in the role of Bond for the first time did great, second to that of Connery (maybe even on par). Not only this but the plot is interesting and easy to follow with a plot twist which maybe some may have expected, but I sure didn't! While not being that big it was a change and it meant that, while not being as emotional as Dalton, Brosnan did put character into the character and didn't just spout cheesy one liners like Moore all the time. As well as an interesting plot the characters livened up the film with possibly the exception of Ourumov who I didn't like much due to being rather miserable and not very menacing. The gadgets on in the film were, from what I've seen and heard of other peoples opinions, not very hi tech and not many were seen (like in Bond's car for instance). However, I think this was a welcome change compared to Brosnans last two Bond films which relied upon the excess use of gadgets. On the other hand, without giving much away, there are parts of the film which have a load of hi tech weaponry and gadgets, but this is what is required from a Bond film, what I am saying about the other two films is that it more heavily relied upon it and as a result they became boring. As for Bond women this film was the last in my opinion (apart if you count Paris Carver in Tomorrow Never Dies)to actually have a half decent reason to why Bond sees a woman instead of her being just a spy working with him for world peace. Not only that her character builds up from being a pathetic coward to being able to look after herself. To sum up, while not being the best Bond film I would say this is one of the best ones. While having bad parts the good parts weigh them out.",GoldenEye

I love all the action and shooting in it and it has all the levels just like the n64 game except silo and i think the caverns level. Pierce Brosnan was an excellent bond in this movie. The movie is just like the game like i said and i love playing the game all the time. Bond and Alec were MI6 partners and friends in the beginning of the movie when they were both in the Facility level. But on the other hand, Alec betrayed bond because pierce changed the time limit on those gas tanks. I love the scene where James and Natalya met in the library room and bond protects Natalya from the bad guys. I don't really like Xenia, Ourumov, Alec and of course Boris because Boris Actually betrayed Natalya too, which i don't understand that.I will always love this movie and watch it..",GoldenEye

367,Pietka-2,This one deserves much more credit then it has received.,10,1 November 1999,"This is by far one of the best Bond films simply because it does not try to be a Bond film.  GoldenEye demonstrates an impressive independence that separates it from the tried-and-true-but-getting-boring Bond formula.  The one liners are not that great, but the action sequences are mindblowing. The chase scene is the best I have ever seen in any movie.  Period.  Purists will complain that there is a lack of gadgetry, but let them pout and go back to MacGyver reruns.  Possibility is not permissibility.  Just because Bond has a snazzy car does not mean that he has to utilize every perk that Q has included.  It is a relief that the writers did not force a new scene just to show off the car.  The movie does not need one, which helps it to maintain its quality as not just a Bond movie, but a high quality action movie that can stand on its own.  You will even find (gasp!) . . . character building!  There is actually dialogue between Q and Bond, instead of just a briefing and some commands.  Brosnan more than holds his own against past Bonds, and offers some of that GQ gentlemen element found missing in some of the past ones.  Bond fan, action fan, any fan, check this one out.  I even made my girlfriend watch it, and even she enjoyed it.  Chances are you will too.",GoldenEye
368,djrexx,THE BEST BOND FILM EVER!,10,1 November 1999,"This is the greatest James Bond film ever in my opinion. With Pierce Brosnan as bond, this film deserves a 10/10. We haven't had a great James Bond since Sean Conery (sp), Pierce Brosnan fits the role of Bond extremley well in GoldenEye. Other then a few flaws in the movie, this movie was a classic Bond film. Involving the Russians. Unlike ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" which is more like a 90's bond movie, unlike GoldenEye which looked as though the entire thing had taken place during the cold war. This movie has done wonders for Brosnan's career. A talented actor that has finally got the credit he deserves.

The part of the Russian turncoat was played very well also. He made me laugh and yell at him at the same time. As for the theme song, well, Tina you did it again!

371,Nicolay-G,A film with a Brosnan who still doesn't fill James Bond shoes.,7,1 October 2018,"I think the love for this film is based in a lot of nostalgia. Even for me, I remember Brosnan as the first ""proper"" Bond. But after watching all Bond films one after another, I now make a less nostalgic judgement.First the good things: Q as always. The new M. Judy Dench is the best thing about this film. I'm glad she continued with Daniel Craig.Also, the new Moneypenny fits the role perfectly.All in all, this is a good film, better than most of the Roger Moore films, and a good introduction to Bond for the people who didn't see the Connery films.Now the bad things:Boris: So obnoxious he reminds me of T.J. MillerAlso, somehow it is impossible not to notice how aptly Brosnan self describes: ""James Bond, stiff-assed Brit"".Yes, Brosnan feels very stiff-assed. All the smug and not so much of the charm. He will do a much better job in later Bond films.And what about the one liners? The writers really let this one down. A classic example of ""tell, don't show"".The tell part, some characters mention the legendary Bond wits:Janus: ""What's the matter, James? No glib remark? No pithy comeback?""And what do we get?:Q: ""May I remind you 007, that you have a license to kill, not to break traffic laws.""007: ""I wouldn't think of that.""Also: - 007 : ""You first. You second.""Really? A total let down, compared with the marvellous Q and M.Verdict: This is a good film, thanks to Q and M. Not so much thanks to Bond.",GoldenEye
372,steve_fantail19,The Best Bond For The 90's,9,7 January 2007,"After Timothy Dalton stepped away from 007 Pierce Brosnan filled in the shoes. To make this film, in my opinion, the greatest Bond for the 90's it would require some great elements. The villain may not be as good as Blofeld or Goldfinger but the fact that the filmmakers attempted a double 00 betrayer was a smart and good move. I Love Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp (she has to be in my top Bond girls, along with Ursula Andress as Honey in Dr. No and Carole Boquet as Melina in For Your Eyes Only) and the insanity of her character. Making Judi Dench 'M' was a good move-she is a good actress- and its good to see Desmond Llewelyn re-attach his role as 'Q'. I didn't really warm to Isabella Scorupco or her character. She was good but not a huge most remembered Bond character. The character of Jack Wade was weird- why not have Felix Leiter as the contact?- but he was good. I liked the General and the Defense Minister- as they sort of pieced together the whole Goldeneye piece.

374,alison_sainty,Great film...but so many mistakes,10,2 August 2002,"Before I start, I'd just like to point out that I absolutely love this film to bits - I once was so obsesses with it that I watched it several times a day. Thankfully, I now don't do this, bit it still remains my favourite film.Has anyone noticed the following mistakes though:(a) When Bond is being briefed on the situation in Severnaya, the satellite is knocked out and all the computer screens aren't getting a signal. During this time Natalya is climbing up the dish to get out of the building. The satellite only comes back when Natalya is running across the snow, but when Bond and Natalya are about to be interogated by Defence Minister Mishkin he says to her 'And I'm willing to bet that you're the one that climbed up the dish to get out'. How did he know that? And how would Bond have been able to point to a person on a computer screen and assume she would know who the insider was? And the conversation in the briefing room with Michael Kitchen and Judy Dench really doesn't flow like a natural conversation - it sounds like it's being read from a script and it's far too predictable.(b) When Bond and Natalya are about to be questioned she also tells Bond 'I've never been to severnaya' but he holds up her arm and says 'Your watch has - frozen by the Goldeneye blast'. How would he have known she was wearing a watch? How would he have known it was her from the satellite when he only met her when they were captured by Mishkin's men and didn't have a chance to talk.(c) In the scene where Bond goes to the boat and opens the wardrobe door only to get the dead admiral (killed by Xenia) falling out in front of him, the film doesn't really explain who stole his ID card from his jacket the night before when he was getting a good squeeze from her. Then, at the same time Bond discovers the body Xenia and some bloke posing as the admiral are being welcomed on board the other boat displaying the Tiger helicopter. This bloke looks very much like the admiral, but who is it? Ourumov? If it isn't him in disguise then where does he come from later on to be able to steal the helicopter with Xenia?Well, that's all I can think of for now. In the scene where Natalya gets reunited with Boris at Janus Headquarters in Cuba and she attacks him, two guards pull her off him. Has anyone noticed how red one of those guard's faces gets? Maybe I'm just sad for noticing? There are also differences between the widescreen and full screen versions.By the way, the soundtrack is great. And anyone who loves the song at the end performed by Eric Serra (the man!) himself will be interested to know that in the film Leon: The Professional at one point in the film (as he does the music to that too) is an instrumental bit of that song!",GoldenEye
375,anturhan2008,So much potential but a weak ending,7,17 September 2021,Generally I liked the film. Brosnan is especially so suitable with the Bond image in the popular culture but the final confrontation is just too lame. The crazy scene with a tank in Russian streets is so remarkable.

376,JimNebuchanezzar,Best Bond movie of em all,7,26 June 2004,"Why is the best Bond movie ever?For starters, Brosnan is a welcome relief from the uptight and intense Timothy Dalton (not to say Dalton was bad, want bad, try Connery), but he delivered his funny lines with about as much charisma as a cooking oil frying, there was mess everywhere and it wasn't neat or pretty to look at, Brosnan takes it a different way, he is intense during scenes that are meant to be intense, and hes relatively funny during relatively funny scenes, and very uptight when confronting the new M about the Servenaya crisis. In a movie that goes away from the standard Bond fair of evil communists that Brtain must destroy, he delivers perfectly. He also meshes perfectly and funnily with Q in the gadget room scene, Bond touching Q's lunch always makes me laugh. His confrontation with M is also good (Judi Dench makes a very welcome entrance to the world of 007 as well, good thing to, i couldn't stand another minute of Robert Brown) the way she calls him a ""sexist masoginist dinosaur"" is brilliant, it goes in perfectly to the Bond franchise, with the Bond character use to bowling over women with his charms, its like he gets a football to his head and she knocks some sense into him. unfortunately, Samantha Bond is a poor substitute for Lois Maxwell, she is far too silly to be a Miss Moneypenny, Moneypenny is supposed to have feelings for Bond, secret feelings, the new Moneypenny shows no sign of this. Sean Bean however is the BEST bond villain ever. I don't know where i saw this comment, but my congrats go out to whoever said it, it summarises his performance perfectly "" You can feel the hatred for Bond flowing through 006 at every second"" and indeed you can, he purpose in the movie is put forward perfectly, there is no way you can be confused, and after you've seen the movie a couple of times, the lines he delivers starts making more and more sense, Ouromov is good also, the way he attacks his role is brilliant, he is evil, the first scene shows this yet everything in his mind is perfectly worked out. Famke Janseen is brilliant also, in her role, noone else could have played it so eveily sexyly.To more important Bond points such as the action scenes, they are absolutely top notch, with the Tank scene and the first scene making you laugh at their outrageousness, yet you love them every minute, the last scene on the antenna cradle is also an 'edge of your seat' scene, with the music playing perfectly, and everything happening around him at once, it is hard to believe Bond an Natalya make it off alive. It is a weird Bond movie, because it gives you reason to like the villain, in other Bond movies, you plain hate the bad guy, or like him because hes so dumb, in this one, Trevelyan has a motive, and it makes you feel as if Bond should die, because he betrayed his best friend.All in all the best Bond movie ever, for the acting, the music, and the story.",GoldenEye
377,adonis_ds,Not a great adaptation of the N64 game.,6,19 December 2019,"As most people know, this movie is based on the legendary videogame GoldenEye 007. I have to say, as a fan of the game it's cool to see many parts of it recreated in really impressive detail. They even managed to find actors that look like the game characters.What made GoldenEye 007 a landmark achievement in videogaming was not its story, it was the gameplay. So it might seem strange that they decided to make a movie out of it. But it is one of the most influential games of its time, and Hollywood correctly identified it as easy money.In order to turn the game into a movie they had to expand the story a lot and make some modifications. The result doesn't really hold up to the original. The action is good, there are some good scenes but also some awkward ones like Xenia strangling men by squeezing their hips. And story overall is a bit ridiculous.I think not including much of the first and most memorable stages was a missed opportunity. Also, the great music of the game is not used much, and when it is we just hear little snippets. It would've been great to hear more of and see more of Facility.I did enjoy the movie, I think it's passable, but I can't really recommend it unless you're a fan of the historic game.",GoldenEye

Unfortunately there is a lack of gadgets within the car and the car is rarely seen, but this is made up by incorporating the classic Aston Martin DB5 at the beginning.

It takes place during the Cold War and has a really good plot and villains. Alec travlyn is definitely one of the best bond villains in the bond series. He also is one of the best because he has a reason to turn rogue unlike other villains and has a really plot to have world domination. He wants.to use a space weapon called goldneye that will destroy England. Alex was once a mi6 agent like bond but decided to turn rogue and faked his death when they were on a mission. It also has a good Bond girl who was a survivor from the shootout the space program per company in Russia. It has a story of betrayal between bond and Alex and Boris and Natalya.

381,masltov,It's good!,9,20 March 2020,"Watching it right now after some 15 years, never realized how good it was. Always was a fan of the game and thus wanted to watch the movie again. I see many resemblances to the Indiana Jones movies and what made those movies great. It's fantastically shot and especially edited. Pure action and entertainment.",GoldenEye
382,smews1,"Not just Brosnan's best, Bond's best.",10,27 December 2006,"Put simply, this is the best Bond film ever.Both Bond girls are incredibly hot, in particular Famke Janssen's Xenia Onatopp. Seriously, if I had to choose a way to die, I'd choose the way she kills people. In case you haven't seen the movie, I won't elaborate, just watch it, you'll know what I mean.The story was amazing, and this was much more realistic than some Bond films to follow (Renard in The World Is Not Enough was a good villain, but the bullet in the brain thing was just a bit off-putting. Same goes for Gustav Graves in Die Another Day, with the gene therapy). Brosnan was great as the suave, sophisticated secret agent.Of course, I can't finish this review without mentioning the incredible performance of Sean Bean. Alec Trevelyan was the best villain in all the Bond films, and I'm not sure I'll ever see the day when someone surpasses him.",GoldenEye
383,johngrant-54201,Fantastic,9,17 July 2018,"This movie was good. I like good movies.
I wish all movies could be good.
Pierce Brosnan was good. 
Judi Dench was good.
The plot was good.
But why wasn't Jaws in it?
It could have been better if Sean Connery played the lead role. I wonder why he didn't. 
Sean Bean was going to.",GoldenEye
384,Big B,Another timeless classic,9,19 October 1998,"Yes, it had it's unrealistic edge. Perhaps the plane scene takes that much flak because it's not cutting edge technology where you have the luxury of technical leeway. Anyway, it got the movie off to the kind of start we expect from a 007 movie. I love Pierce Brosnan's version of Bond. I've heard criticism that he's not physically large enough, but I think that he has a very deceptive physique, and they scripted him to have Bond-like strength, so it didn't matter that much anyway. I did enjoy the special effects, as outlandish as they were. The plot-line was solid enough for a Bond movie. There were holes, but no gaping holes, just minor ones. I loved Joe Don Baker as Jack Wade; I was glad to see him back in Tomorrow Never Dies. All in all, a great Bond flick. If you're a Bond connoisseur, you will probably offended by this or that, but if you're just a Bond fan looking for a good Bond picture, this will more than satisfy.",GoldenEye
385,Bond-19,Amazing!,10,20 September 1998,"This has got to be the best Bond to date! There's no other movie like it, from St. Petersburg to Cuba to Severnaya it has everything in it to make it a quintessential Bond movie as well one of the best movies evermade!",GoldenEye
386,Pikachu-11,GOOD SHOW,10,22 September 1999,"Goldeneye is the best James Bond Movie I have ever seen so far. I can't wait till the new one comes out. But until the new one comes out, I will be watching Goldeneye as much as I can. If you like James Bond and you haven't see Goldeneye, then I suggest you do!",GoldenEye
387,mrbein,A Super Duper Movie,9,15 December 1999,GoldenEye is one of the best bond movies. It has great action. I loved this movie. There is never a dull moment. That is if your watching it for the first to 6th time. The opening credits can get really boring during the 10th viewing. Sean Bean is a good villain. He is evil enough. Boris is a good villain too. He can really make you laugh. Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond since Sean Connery. He has a Moore/Connery feel about him. So in closing watch this movie.  IT RULES!,GoldenEye
388,jamie.a.burns,"Wow, what a film...",8,24 May 2000,"I started watching Bond films about a year ago, when I bought the game on the N64.  I got into Bond straight away, and I can now call myself an 'expert'!!!  I have watched all Bond films at least twice, and I can safely say Goldeneye is the best.  It has everything, a great plot, fantastic actors, EVERYTHING!  It is really one to watch.",GoldenEye
389,raioknight,One of the BEST,10,27 May 2000,GoldenEye is one of the BEST bond movies ever. I think the theme is GREAT and the plot is a mix of classic Bond and new-age technology incorporated into a great storyline and the musical scores just added to it. A MUST for all Bond fans.,GoldenEye

392,sambo-26,James Bond Through Generations...,10,7 July 2006,"When I was 10, after a long day at school, I came home to find that we had rented the newest James Bond to video. Goldeneye. Until then I didn't even know who James Bond was or how my family and those around me at the time were able to state fact after fact about him. All I knew was that this film had to be something special.After I watched this film, I fell in love. It became one of my favorites, and still is today. The action, adventure and the fact that it was rated (PG), allowing me to watch made it great. Throughout the next year or two I had made it my mission to watch every Bond flick ever made, and I did. Even ""Her Majesty's Secret Service"".The James Bond series are an excellent example of how the film industry has developed over the last forty or so years and how a series, if utilized in the right way, can continue to entertain generation after generation.When I have children they will also experience the pleasure of watching the James Bond series and maybe explain to me the new plots being created in the new films of their time.",GoldenEye
393,dsauer,A very enjoyable film which every Bond fan will love,8,9 July 2001,"James Bond has returned!  Goldeneye stars Pierce Brosnon as James Bond, everyone's favourite spy.  The movie contains everything needed for a great Bond film Gadgets, Babes, Action and Guns!  A must see for any Bond fan!",GoldenEye
394,firstdoubleshot,Remarkable Debut,8,18 October 2002,"After years without a Bond, Brosnan makes a remarkable debut and immediately IS James Bond 007, child of the late and the great Mr. Ian Fleming.From the opening scene, a bungee jump off a dam that has no right to be that height, Bond is back with a vengeance.Long may he live, may he live forever!",GoldenEye
395,braddles96,Ridiculous,6,8 January 2012,"This is by far the worst Bond film to date. The amount of bullets Bond manages to dodge throughout the film is mind blowing, especially in the library scene. There must be at least 20 Russian guards shooting a full round of ammo at Bond and he still dodges them. when Bond finally has cover he shoots a couple of bullets at the guards and they die. Also it cant be the gun's fault for its inaccuracy and recoil as Bond and the Russian guards both have an AK47 (gun).Also, the scene in which Bond manages to get in front of a fast travelling train is simply inexplicable, how he manges to get in front of the train is pathetic. The only way Bond could get in front of this train is if the train was going round in circles and it wasn't!The only real positive in this film is the action scenes; they are great, but sadly within these action scenes there are a couple of blundering and annoying moments.Lastly, if you were a villain in a Bond film and you had captured 007, you would kill him at any given chance. But no, they have to give him a few minutes or moments to try and let Bond escape and within in these scenes Q's inventions are perfect for the situation in which Bond encounters, for example a exploding pen or a watch with a built in laser.I feel slightly contradictive writing this review on how ridiculous this film is as I am a 'huge' 007 fan, but this film has ruined the Bond series and it's reputation, but of course this is my opinion.",GoldenEye
396,crapat35,"""Goldeneye"" - Superb",10,3 February 2010,"James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) makes his stunning comeback in ""Goldeneye"". From the previous James Bond films this would be one I would recommend over all of the rest. For one, it stars my personal favorite Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, which I think is the best there has been since Sean Connery up to this point. The story line is rather well played out as Bond returns to prevent an old friend from taking revenge upon England in a scandal to send it back to the stone age for what they have done to his family years ago. 007 must keep a clear head and treat it as a mission like any other and prevent it from being personal, which would most likely end him up as KIA. (Killed In Action) With this in mind, it makes it an interesting film with two partners, turned enemies with the same training and skill to keep you on the edge of your seat.",GoldenEye
397,commanderb,Excellent movie,10,8 March 2004,"This was a perfect Bond film. It contains all the elements of the classic Bond-action, suspense, humor, romance, evil villains, and an excellent plot. Sean Bean plays an excellent villain as Alec Trevelyan. What made this one special is that the bad guy was from Bond's past and was a former friend. I can't help but praise this movie! After a six year hiatus Bond makes his triumphant return to the big screen. This movie is much better than Tomorrow Never Dies in which 007 is a little too trigger-happy. The World is not Enough lacks a good plot. Die Another Day lacks a good villain. This movie has everything the other films lack. My friend told me they were going to make a second Goldeneye video game. The only way I see this possible is because one Goldeneye satellite still exists. The one that fired on Servanya is still out there somewhere. That is the only con with this movie. They don't destroy both satellites. Other than that, this is a great movie!I give it a 10/10.",GoldenEye
398,matteus_acn,An excellent Bond movie,9,10 February 2015,"This is probably the best James Bond movie. I used to play the N64 game when I was a kid and when I watched this movie, years later, It was like I'm kid again, seeing all the scenarios that make this game one of the best shooters of all time.Pierce Brosnan was the best 007 actor and he was excellent in this movie. The other characters were also great. This movie has a good story and pace, with excellent action sequences, a great villain and beautiful women.9/10",GoldenEye
399,hoppimike,Pretty much a perfect action movie,10,24 June 2021,"Strange how the average review score for this film is only sitting just over 7/10.I've always thought it was great - a perfect balance of action, atmosphere and comedic touches, great gadgets, a great actor playing Bond who fits the role perfectly, memorable characters, etc!I really love this director too - his action scenes in particular are so intense and satisfying!Negatives erm... hm.I don't know! I suppose if you want a more serious or gritty Bond movie you might be happier with something like Casino Royale.I find it very hard to criticise this film which is why I give it 10/10 :)",GoldenEye
400,kinky_chris_2001uk,An Excellent Bond Film,10,11 March 2005,"After a 6 year hiatus the producers needed to make this film good enough to bring Bond back to the forefront, and in comparison to the films that followed, I believe this to be the best. Without a cold war to fuel plot lines, the story is able to step into new territories, with many great plot elements. Pierce Brosnan portrays Bond amazingly well in my opinion, and ties all the classic 007 elements together flawlessly. Although adhering to the Bond foundations, this film has a great, fresh feel to it, I think partly due to the industrial style score by Eric Serra. I think you need to see this film more than once to fully appreciate it, but it is definitely a classic!",GoldenEye
401,eisverkaufer,Worst Bond film ever,3,6 January 2006,"I hated this one. There were just too many implausibilities. (See the IMDb Goofs section.) 1. I wasn't buying the woman who kills men with her thighs. And that scene near the beginning seemed almost pornographic, too. 2. When she tries to kill Bond that way, he just seemed like a weenie. I mean her thighs are quite shapely and not at all musclebound, while he on the other hand has beat up hundreds of bad guys with his bare hands. 3. Bond not only catches up with the plane it mid-air, but he also manages to fly into it and take control. This is what I would expect of Bugs Bunny, not James Bond. 4. They link up with an enemy computer system on the train. (It's been 10 years since I saw this movie, so I don't remember the details, but I know how hard it is to get interfaces working on systems that want to talk to each other.) Bond has never been about verisimilitude, but this was ridiculous.",GoldenEye
402,davidlhorn,Golden Hole,7,6 August 2016,"1st, let me say I've seen this movie a dozen times. I'm a fan of Bond and I think this is probably the best of the Pierce Brosnan ""Bond"" movies. It's an enjoyable romp. I know, it's a bond movie. I shouldn't be so critical. Just enjoy the movie. But I do have to call out lazy script writing and giant gaping holes.The biggest one that stands out to me is the overall premise of the movie and what sets up everything else that follows.So Russia decides to build an EMP space weapon. it's controlled by a device called the ""Goldeneye"" and a pair of fail safe keys. Okay. The bad guys are somehow able to create a 2nd satellite EMP weapon without Russia or anyone else knowing about it. Okay. They are also able to build a 2nd satellite control center in Cuba without the motherland or anyone else knowing about this either. Okay. They are able to accomplish both of these multi-billion-dollar projects and staff the Cuba satellite center with bad guys sympathetic to their evil cause. Okay.I guess the problem that I have is they are able to do all of this and yet they are unable to create a 2nd ""Goldeneye"" and fail safe keys for this 2nd Cuban weapon center. That's a Herculean task to perform without either side ever finding out and yet they can't create a big jewel on a piece of plastic and a couple of brass keys.Because of this, they have to steal an EMP shielded helicopter, blowup the 1st Severnaya satellite control center all of which alerts the Russians, Americans and British to their evil plan for a world economic meltdown. What? lol.",GoldenEye
403,RufflesHaveRidges,Appeals to both die hard Bond fans and bonded Die Hard fans,9,3 July 2007,"The first Bond film to star Pierce Brosnan is the best of his reign as far as I'm concerned. I grew up with Brosnan as Bond. I remember Goldeneye 007 was one of the first games I got on N64, and is still quite possibly the best video game ever created. The film has everything thing you would want out of a Bond film, with some upgraded gadgets and a bonus with the infamous sex goddess/killer Xenia. Brosnan delivers the one liners admirably, and Sean Bean is awesome as always.Sadly, the Bond films all went slowly downhill from here on out, until Casino Royale of course. But i still think Goldeneye will always be my favorite Bond film.",GoldenEye
404,khavanov1991,great first bond for Brosnan,10,28 October 2014,"i'm reviewing the movie nearly 20 years after its release, but the movie still kick asses even today! The movie was the perfect entry for Brosnan after much issues with the james bond series, as the last bond was 6 years prior to this one, goldeneye who came out in 1995. Almost everything is good in the flick and all the bond elements are present, sexy cars, beautiful bond girls, great villain, kinda average plot but still entertaining! Last but not least the action is almost non- stop, this is a very fast-paced bond.The cast is splendid, one of the best of all bond films, especially Sean bean's impeccable job as a quite memorable villain as Alec Trevelyan.The score is nothing short of awesome just like all bond films, the end was kinda sucky though and ridiculous but it doesn't hurt the movie too much, the fight scene between the two agents was excellent and one of the best fist fight in a bond film.For me it was my first bond film in cinema, maybe thats why i rated so high but many people will agree its one of the best bond easily top5!",GoldenEye
405,kkpigpen,Am I Missing Something? Why Do People Think This Movie Is Good?,1,6 April 2020,"This movie was released the day before I was born (11/17/95), so obviously I didn't see it when it first came out. My parents and older brother used to watch this movie a lot when I was younger. I hadn't actually watched it until now. I watched it and it just felt INCREDIBLY hollow. Big bad Russian guy and suspected dead BFF team up to destroy the world, starting with London.....hmm. Not even to mention the horrible dialogue. Also, Bond & Trevelyan could've killed each other on several different occasions, but didn't for some reason? Bond has a tank while staring directly at a train filled with all the bad guys and he doesn't blow it up? Okay then... Bond kills like 50 Russian dudes while escaping from prison with ""Hot Chick #2"", but doesn't take the 3 seconds needed to kill the main Russian bad guy? This movie only needed to be like half an hour long.Another thing I found rather funny was that Dame Judy Dench calls Bond a misogynistic dinosaur, but the movie still follows all the dumbass female stereotypes anyway. Sure, Natalya is a smart, ""independent"" programmer, but she's just the same helpless Bond girl everyone is used to. Can we also talk about the crazy ass female assassin (spy?) that seemed to have an orgasm every time she tried to kill a man with her legs HAHAHAHA What? Why? How? Who thought this would be cool/sexy? I found it hilarious. It seemed like something you see in an SNL skit or in Austin Powers. Also, if they were in such a rush to get Golden Eye back, why did they take the time to get sweet new outfits, drive the convertible through Cuba, and spend the rest of the day/night in some kickass beach house instead of shutting everything down the day before the bad guys were going to launch the weapon?We all know the Bond movies are made for the dudes that just want to bro out and watch their man crush blow up some commies, so the story doesn't really need to be fantastic. But dang...I was really expecting at least some good twists or something? This movie just felt like a macho version of a Rom-Com to me. It was like a Hallmark Christmas movie with a little less romance & gingerbread, and a lot more dynamite & communists. The only thing I can say is that maybe this movie was pretty good back in 1995, but if this movie came out today, it would be perceived as a horrible spoof movie deserving of the worst ridicule late night tv has to offer.",GoldenEye
406,yugiohguy50,Goldeneye Comment,10,24 October 2005,"This movie rocked! The way Bond says ""No.......... For me."" At the end is CLASSIC! I guess Nintendo and Rareware liked it so much they made a game out of it. That game (Goldeneye 007) was second in the N64 Shooter era only to its follow-up (Perfect Dark). I own that game, and placed an order for PD. I recommend those who liked the movie to play the game. It may seem like ""Oh, I already know the damn plot, why play a game?"" but you are wrong. It is just so cool, because they added new ideas, such as, on the train, you have to battle all the way through instead of dropping in to the final car. Play the game, I promise you'll love it.--Steven",GoldenEye
407,gopalmarar,and the best Bond film is....,8,14 November 2008,"Connery was the best, but nostalgia aside, the best film is probably Golden Eye. It has a fabulous opening title sequence, the best chase scene (Bond in a tank, through the streets of St.Petersburg), one of the prettiest babes (Izabella Scorupco), the most bizarre bad-babe character (Famke Janssen, not only named Onatopp but also able to crush men between her thighs) and best of all, the most stylish and psychologically convincing villain by far in Sean Bean, back-from-the-dead agent 006.In fact Sean Bean with his great lines and superb delivery out-classes Brosnan without trying. See the movie again and be surprised, like me. Brosnan's possibly the only minus to this film. Makes you wonder, why wasn't Bean made the next Bond instead of Craig? Probably because he already played this role! Real pity.",GoldenEye
