0,SnoopyStyle,standard Disney princess,7,8 March 2021,"Kumandra was once a peaceful kingdom of people and dragons living in harmony. Some 500 years earlier, the Druun suddenly appear to turn people and dragons into stone. The last dragon Sisu (Awkwafina) created the dragon gem to defeat the Druun and return the people from stone. Non of the dragons survived and the world was divided into five warring factions. 500 years later, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) is a princess of the Heart Clan learning to be the next protector of the gem. As her father tries to reunite the clans, Raya is betrayed and the gem is broken into five pieces. The Druun is released back into the world. Six years later, Raya is on a quest to find the last dragon among the apocalyptic landscape.This is a standard modern day Disney princess. They take a local exotic culture and insert an adventure for a young girl. They do it well. In this one, there is a feel-good overall message within the adventure. One probably has different levels of appreciation depending on how one feels about Awkwafina. I do feel that Awkwafina is being too much Awkwafina. She has one voice and that voice feels too familiar. It's not a dragon's voice. It's not even a cartoon voice. It's just her voice doing Awkwafina things. That threw me off somewhat. I think I want Sisu to be someone else, maybe a little innocent girl. Awkwafina can still be one of the fellowship of the gem. The shrimp boat captain can be a sarcastic old woman. All in all, this is good family fun for everyone. I expect nothing less from a standard Disney princess movie.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1,boblipton,Disney Princesses Save The Day After Wrecking It,6,4 April 2021,"Disney animation starts up again, with the princesses in a land that used to have dragons; after her father is turned into stone and the magical artifact is busted up by the rulers of the other countries, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) goes on a hero's journey to restore the dragons, unite the lands, depetrify her father and get revenge on the other princess (Gemma Chan) who caused all the foofaraw.It all seemed a little too perky and angsty and darned complicated a mythology to have shoved down your throat in ninety minutes; Tolkien needed a huge children's book and three fat volumes of trilogy just to give you the Reader's Digest version of Middle Earth. And then the dragon shows up with a carefully skewed attitude and a creaky young-old voice (Awkwafina) that enchanted me, and the story began to turn around. And while it never lost its deliberate naivete, in the end, it was put together by professionals who know how to make me leak tears. So while it's not a great movie, it's a good one, and parents are going to get very tired of playing it for their toddlers.",Raya and the Last Dragon
2,nogodnomasters,It is all about Trust,7,23 March 2021,"The world is split into five parts named after a dragon. It is in ruins and dying as druuns (purple Death Eaters) are turning people to stone. Princess Raya must play Tomb Raider to recover the gems and save the world. But first she must find the dragon. It won't be easy as no one wants to give up their piece of the gem.The film is only mildly Asian in tradition. The language is modern English slang. Raya's eyes are almost round. Sisu (the villain) has more slanted eyes. Doesn't Disney know to end the stereotype? The ending reminded me a little of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" minus the dance off.",Raya and the Last Dragon
3,jboothmillard,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,31 May 2021,"I didn't know if I was interested in seeing this Disney movie, but then I remembered seeing the trailer for it months before the lockdown, it did look like it would be good fun. Basically, five centuries ago, the prosperous ancient land of Kumandra was ravaged by the Druun, evil spirits that attack and petrified the land's people and dragons. According to legend, the last dragon known as Sisu transferred her magic into a gem and banished the Druun, reviving Kumandra's people who were turned to stone, but the dragons were lost. A power struggle for the orb divided the people of Kumandra into tribes, based on their placement along a giant, dragon-shaped river: Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon, and Tail. 500 years later, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), the daughter of Heart tribe leader Chief Benja (Lost's Daniel Dae Kim) has been training to become a guardian of the gem, and she is delighted when her father says she is ready. Chief Benja believes that the tribes of the former Kumandra can be united once again and decides to hold a feast for the leaders of all five tribes. During the feast, Raya befriends the daughter of Chief Virana (Sandra Oh) of the Fang tribe, young Namaari (Jona Xiao), who gives Raya a dragon pendant as a gift. Trusting her, Raya shows Namaari the location of the gem. But Namaari betrays Raya, revealing that she is trying to help Fang steal the gem. Benja and the other tribes are alerted of this and arrive at the scene and start fighting for possession of the gem. During the scuffle, the orb is shattered into pieces, which reawakens the Druun. Each tribe steals a piece of the orb and flee as the Druun return and ravage Heart and its people. Chief Benja is wounded, he knows that the weakness of the Druun is water; he gives Raya his piece of the orb and throws her into the river before he is petrified and turned to stone. Six years later, Raya has grown up into a young woman, and rides on the back of her best friend and steed Tuk Tuk (Alan Tudyk) (a mix of an armadillo and a pill bug). She has been trekking across the lands and wilderness of Kumandra to find Sisu, the last dragon, to help her recover the missing orb pieces. After reaching the final river on the map, she finds a shipwreck in Tail. Raya recites a spell to summon the dragon and is surprised when Sisu the dragon (Awkwafina) appears. But Sisu admits that she did not create the orb, but only used it on behalf of her siblings and can gain her siblings' powers when she touches its pieces. Meanwhile, a grownup and hostile Namaari (Gemma Chan) has been travelling across Kumandra with her tribesmen who are after Raya's stolen portrait of Sisu. Raya and Sisu manage to recover the second piece from a booby-trapped Tail temple and the corpse of its leader. This piece of the orb grants Sisu shapeshifting powers, and she is able to transform into a human. Raya and Namaari are momentarily reunited and antagonise each other before Raya and Sisu escape the temple. They escape on the boat of young restauranteur Boun (Izaac Wang), who lost his family to the Druun. Boun comes across friendly, but Raya does not fully trust him, and insists that Sisu stays in human form. The group arrives at Talon to find the third gem piece, during which Raya encounters ""con baby"" Noi (Thalia Tran) and her trio of monkey-like companions, the Ongis, who adopted her after the Druun petrified her mother. After a chase, Raya recruits Noi and the Ongis while Sisu encounters Talon's chieftess Dang Hu (Lucille Soong), who offers her to the Druun for the other orb pieces. Raya rescues Sisu and reclaims the third piece, giving Sisu the power to spew out fog which they use to escape. The group then arrives at Spine, where they meet fearsome warrior Tong (Benedict Wong), the village's sole survivor. Namaari arrives and Raya holds her off in a fight so the others can escape. Before Namaari can defeat her, Sisu turns back into a dragon and saves Raya. The companions, realising that Sisu is a dragon, agree to help Raya, and Tong hands over Spine's gem piece, giving Sisu the power to control rain. As the group get closer to Fang, Sisu suggests allying with Namaari rather than stealing the final piece. When Raya refuses, Sisu takes her back to the remains of the Heart. She shows her the remains of her siblings, Pangu, Jagan, Pranee, and Amba, turned to stone; she says that her siblings' trust in her was what really empowered her to save Kumandra. Raya relents and decides to give Namaari the dragon pendant as a peace offering. Raya and Sisu meet privately with Namaari, who is torn what to do; she wants to save Fang's reputation, but also wants to help to defeat the Druun. Seeing the pieces of the orb, she threatens to shoot them with a crossbow. Sisu tries to calm Namaari down but is fatally shot when Raya lashes her sword on Namaari's crossbow. With the last dragon dead, the water is subsequently drained from all surrounding lakes, seas and rivers, and Fang is overrun by the Druun. Raya and Namaari viciously fight while Raya's companions rescue the people of Fang using the remaining power of the gem pieces. Raya overpowers Namaari and prepares to kill her, but seeing that she is mourning her mother who has been turned to stone, and realising that Sisu's death is her fault due to her inability to trust others, she stops. Raya and Namaari try to aid the group instead. As the Druun surround Raya's group, Raya remembers how trust allowed Sisu to save the world before and urges the others to unite and reassemble the gem. One by one, the group piece together the orb before allowing themselves to be taken by the Druun and turned to stone. Finally, Raya hands over her piece of the almost completed orb to Namaari, to show her faith, and allows herself to be petrified. Namaari finishes assembling the gem before the Druun petrify her as well. The last remnant of power in the reassembled and everybody trusting each other causes a blast to vanquish the Druun, and everyone, including the dragons, are revived. The dragons revive Sisu while everyone reunites with their lost loved ones, including Raya and her father. The dragons and the tribes gather at Heart to celebrate and finally reunite as Kumandra. Also starring Lucille Soong as Dang Hu, Dichen Lachman as General Atitaya / Spine Warrior, and Patti Harrison as Tail Chief. Tran is impeccable as the voice of the title character, but Awkwafina often steals the show with her hilarious fast-talking and snappy personality. The animation is superb, the characters are wonderful, the story set in an ancient world with dragons and other strange creatures and many dazzling backdrops is smart and engaging, the mythical and martial arts genres blend together nicely, it is often exciting and funny, and the score by James Newton Howard is rousing, a magnificent computer-animated fantasy action adventure. Very good!",Raya and the Last Dragon
4,paul_haakonsen,Wholeheartedly entertaining and visually impressive...,8,5 March 2021,"Well, I was definitely looking forward to getting to sit down to watch ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" and I must admit that I had some expectations for this 2021 animated movie, no doubt about that.And Disney definitely delivered with this animated movie. I will give them that much. Yeah, ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" was an enjoyable animated movie in many ways. First of all, the storyline was good, and it was one that was pretty straight forward and easy to follow. It wasn't cluttered down with an abundance of side plots and sub-stories, no it was straight forward and to the point. But perhaps that could be a double-edged sword, because that could also mean that the storyline didn't offer as much as it could have to some people? But hey, I was entertained.Now, if you have an interest in Asian culture and mythology, there are lots of things to life in ""Raya and the Last Dragon"".Then there were the characters. Indeed, there was an abundance of likeable and loveable characters here, from the small monkey-like creatures to the majestic dragons, and everything in between. I really liked the Raya character and also the dragon Sisu.""Raya and the Last Dragon"" has some pretty amazing and visually stunning-looking CGI animations. Wow. When you sit down to watch the 2021 ""Raya and the Last Dragon"", prepare to be bedazzled. I was in awe at the impressive CGI and art style they used for this animated movie. It looked very realistic, while still maintaining a sense of it being but an animated movie. But wow, the colors, the details, the sharpness to it all and the dynamic flow to it. Just made the entire animated world spring to life in a very believable and realistic manner. Thumb up, way, way up to the CGI department here.And with ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" being an animated movie, then of course having the right selection of voice performers is crucial. And yes, they most certainly had that here. With a majority of Asian voice performers, I must admit that I was impressed. And I am glad to see - well, hear, technically - Kelly Marie Tran back on the screen. I am not familiar with Awkwafina, but she really nailed the voice performance for Sisu.If you are just going to watch one animated feature in 2021, let it be ""Raya and the Last Dragon"", trust me. This one offers something for the entire family. I sat down to watch this with my 11 year old son and we were both loving it.My rating of ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars. I was initially going to rate it a seven, but the impressive CGI really upped the game here.",Raya and the Last Dragon
5,studioAT,Raya and the Last Dragon,3,5 June 2021,"As others have said, this looks stunning in terms of the animation, there's some lovely voice work, but the story and the themes feel like they've been done a lot, by Disney and by others recently, and it feels a bit samey.I'm sure for young women this films messages of empowerment are very uplifting, but I can't say I'd rank this amongst other Disney classics.",Raya and the Last Dragon
6,bevo-13678,Yay,10,18 September 2021,Good one. Just like Moana but in a different location.,Raya and the Last Dragon
7,CinemaSerf,Two-dimensional mythology.,6,9 June 2021,"The snag with this film is that you already expect Disney to deliver top class animation, so the fact that they certainly do here is almost a ""so-what"" when it comes to the rest of it - and sadly, that's where the film struggles a bit. The dialogue is clearly aimed a very specific age group, with popular culture references that can, on occasion, just make you wince. As ever with this studio, there is an underlying moral. This time, it is avarice, greed - something guarateed to decimate the fragile peace amongst the tribes named after the parts of a great dragon (""Sisu"") that gave it's life force to save humanity from an evil many years ago. When these nasty (think ""Dementors"") beasties return, it falls to ""Raya"" and her rather fun tortoise-esque pet that doubles up as her bike to try and track down what's left of ""Sisu"" and hope it can help save them from oblivion. The dragon - well, sadly, it looks like something from a particularly crass episode of ""My Little Pony"" and the attitudinal dialogue is pretty annoying, not to say banal. That said, it is still good looking film with plenty of action, a little (contrived) humour and some of he best animated fine-dining I've seen for ages. Not a film that we will remember seeing in five years time, but that could be said of so many from the animation factory that Disney has become now. Not terrible, but not great either...",Raya and the Last Dragon
8,view_and_review,Another Disney Princess,6,6 March 2021,"Like many Disney movies these days, I was more-or-less obligated to watch. My daughter was excited about it and wanted me to watch it too. As they say, ""If you like it, I love it."" Well, not quite. I fell asleep for a spell. I think one of the druuns got me and turned me to stone for a few scenes.""Raya and the Last Dragon"" takes place in a fictitious land called Kamundra. Without going into the detail of the hows and whys, the main character has to collect pieces of a broken crystal ball in order to bring back all the people turned to stone by the druuns (a plague based upon the discord of people that took physical shape). The main character, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), is aided by the dragon Sisu (Awkwafina),The movie was funny and upbeat, just not enough to keep me fully engaged.",Raya and the Last Dragon
9,evanston_dad,Going Through the Motions,6,25 August 2021,"The animation is absolutely dazzling, but otherwise this movie just goes through the motions. There are a lot of platitudes about trust and tolerance that we've heard a million times before -- same book, different cover.Grade: B.",Raya and the Last Dragon
10,cherold,"cute, amusing, well meaning, and forgetable",7,13 March 2021,"I enjoyed Raya and the Last Dragon, which follows a young woman's attempt to return life and dragons to a desolated world. The animation is pretty, Awkwafina is terrific as a genial dragon, the story is well paced. there are some cool action bits, and there's a nice kumbaya resolution that balances out the copious swordplay (swords have replaced crowns as the number one Disney Princess accessory).But even though I saw it yesterday, the movie is already fading from my memory. Nothing really stands out. Nothing is particularly surprising. It follows a well-worn path with well honed skill.I would recommend this, but if you don't watch it you haven't missed anything all that special. But it's cute.",Raya and the Last Dragon
11,FeastMode,I could tell it was good immediately,7,7 November 2021,"This is a great animated movie. Visually beautiful with a good story, heart, and some pretty cool action (the fight scenes were really good!). I was emotionally invested in the characters and the outcome of the story. Very funny. Awkwafina did a great job, elevating her character. I really enjoyed it and would watch it again. Oh and I liked the musical score. (1 viewing, 11/6/2021)",Raya and the Last Dragon
12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Or: How to Make a Movie in a Pandemic.,7,30 June 2021,"'Raya And The Last Dragon (2021)' has a strange tone that actually sees its comedy clash immensely with its drama, rather than compliment it. It doesn't help that the opening is pretty much played straight and that there is a rather serious undercurrent running throughout the entire affair. It also has an odd pace that kind of makes it feel like a video-game truncated into two hours, awkwardly squashed to fit its medium. These issues are particularly frustrating because there are segments in which the movie truly is great. Rather than being outright bad, its least successful moments simply pull down its most successful ones and make the overall affair less effective than it clearly could have been. Still, it's not as if the flick isn't enjoyable. For the most part, it's a solidly entertaining experience with some unique aesthetics and appropriately amazing animation. The fact that it was completed almost entirely from home due to COVID-19 is especially impressive; it looks and moves just as good as any of Disney's recent efforts, if not better. One highlight is certainly its fight scenes, which typically have quite a bit of weight to them and emulate something seen in a proper martial arts flick (though they're obviously less violent). In the end, this is a mostly fun but occasionally frustrating adventure. Despite its issues, it proves that people can pull together to create compelling no matter what the circumstances may be. 7/10.",Raya and the Last Dragon
13,ThomasDrufke,Gorgeous,9,22 October 2021,"Raya and the Last Dragon is the type of Disney animated film we'd get in the mid 90's. Heartfelt, at times heartbreaking, but most of all an achievement in animation that instantly makes you want to revisit the story shortly after. Oh, and it's also perfect for young children who want to be entertained and adults who look for life lessons hidden in these films (unlike most of Universal's animation).9.5/10.",Raya and the Last Dragon
14,Edvis-1997,7,7,14 March 2021,"It's really decent movie. I'm very surprised and shocked in a good way about Disney movies. I thought, that after releasing Soul,(which was amazing,I would consider as one of the best movie of 2020) it will take a lot of time to create something good again but nah, Disney is serving us in this Pandemic with full strength. Animation of this looked very nice, high quality, I've enjoyed actors and actresses voices. It had a lot of action, I wouldn't consider idea as something unique, because there's dragon and Raya looks a lot like Moana(at least for me).After watching ""Scooby-Doo The Sword and the Scoob"" and ""Tom&Jerry movie"" I can say that they could learn a lot from Disney how to create good animation. I've enjoyed that this is not just basic movie but it has deep message to the world.I would recommend to watch it for families and animation lovers. It's in my top10 of 2021 best movies so far.",Raya and the Last Dragon
15,cricketbat,This film will keep kids entertained and it won't annoy adults,7,7 March 2021,"Visually, Raya and the Last Dragon is a treat. The animation of this movie is engaging, and the colors & textures are enthralling. The plot isn't anything new, though. It's derivative of many stories we've seen before, so it's fairly predictable. However, this film will keep kids entertained and it won't annoy adults. It's not the best Disney has to offer, but it's still pretty good.",Raya and the Last Dragon
16,westsideschl,Fast Food Commercial Quality,4,3 June 2021,Animation quality was average; no detail. Characters were very stereotypical & bland. Storyline has been done many times before; very predictable. Voicing was also bland; very formula. Good for grade schoolers who haven't been exposed to plot either in print or video.,Raya and the Last Dragon
17,paulclaassen,So disappointing...,4,20 May 2021,"I was so looking forward to a good, new, original animated film. Unfortunately, 'Raya and the Last Dragon' is not what I was looking for.'Raya and the Last Dragon' is a great movie to keep children occupied. Kids surely will love this film. As for a mature audience, though, I have my doubts. Yes, this movie looks incredible on screen. The animation is great. The adventure element will appeal to a mature audience. But sadly the overbearing silly humor deem this a kids' movie. The most annoying part about the movie was Sisu - the dragon who supposedly saved the world. She is an idiotic, stupid character with the most annoying voicing and 'what the hell' dialogue.Furthermore, its not clear who - or what - the antagonist is. Is it the Druun? Is it Namaari? And who is the protagonist? Since the film is called ' Raya and the Last Dragon', who assume it to be Raya, but then again Raya doesn't save the day, does she? So is it Sisu? Or Namaari? Yup, again, Namaari. I'm not sure whether she's meant to be good or bad...protagonist or antagonist...There are also so many plot holes and incoherent story line. Having just met Namaari, Raya shows her where Sisu's gem is kept. What??!! She shows her one of the most guarded 'treasures' within minutes having met her!!?? Towards the end Namaari's actions are also questionable, as well as Raya's. On more than one occasion did the question arise: how did they know to do that? How did they know what the outcome of there actions would be with so much uncertainty and little knowledge of what they were up against? It simply wasn't believable. Then again - as mentioned previously - if intended for a young demographic, these issues wouldn't bother them. And then there's the baby who reminded me of Boss Baby, and her sidekicks who reminded me of Kung Fu Panda. There actually were so many references to other animated characters that this hardly felt original.The film sends out a powerful message about trust, but maybe also focuses so much on this that it feels like they're spoon feeding the audience. As much as I wanted to, I just couldn't get into this film.Would I watch it again? No.",Raya and the Last Dragon
18,briancham1994,A great new addition to the Disney Animated Canon,8,11 June 2021,"I'm surprised by the negativity of a lot of the other reviews. They relentlessly mention how typical and overdone the storyline is. While Disney was clearly sticking to their tested formula, I wouldn't accuse the entire film of being derivative. Some parts will be obvious to anyone who has seen a Disney film before - the protagonist gets orphaned, will go on a fetch quest, will have to make a sacrifice; dead characters will come back to life and everyone will learn some sort of life lesson. The execution of the film, however, adds a unique flavour and setting that more than make up for the conventional story structure. The design and animation of the world is stunning - almost on par with Kubo and the Two Strings. The characters are memorable (if a little too goofy) and contemporary in style (which turns off a lot of older viewers, but if it worked for the genie in Aladdin, it works here). The message is quite pertinent to modern times, although it was badly handled at times. Overall, while Raya and the Last Dragon clearly adheres to Disney's formula, I think there is more that sets it apart from their previous works and ultimately deserves credit for its strengths rather than being dismissed as gimmicks.",Raya and the Last Dragon
19,Thanos_Alfie,Raya...,7,15 March 2021,"""Raya and the Last Dragon"" is an Animation - Adventure movie in which we watch a young girl trying to find the last dragon and stop some creatures of destroying Earth. She has to hurry because she is not the only one who wants to locate the last dragon.I liked this animation movie because it was entertaining and it had a nice, interesting plot that did not bore me at all. The direction which was made by Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada was very good and they did a nice job on how they presented their main character (Raya) and how she tried with all of her power to find the last dragon and what this dragon represented to her. The selection of the voices of Kelly Marie Tran as Raya and Awkwafina as Sisu was a nice choice and their combination made this movie much more entertaining. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" is an interesting, different, entertaining animation movie with a simply beautiful meaning and I recommend everyone to watch it because everyone can gain and earn something by watching it.",Raya and the Last Dragon
20,cruise01,Amazing and beautiful animation with a wonderful story.,8,15 March 2021,4 out of 5 stars.Raya and the Last Dragon is a good animated fantasy film that delivers a colorful beautiful animation. With a good talented voice cast.The plot is good showing how a region groups have been divided when the dragons have all sacrificed themselves to protect them against a force of evil. Raya discovers the last dragon and is trying to reunite the regions to face against the evil.The animation is colorful. And visuals are stunning to look. Great action. Voice talent. And music score.

21,eddie_baggins,A familiar and forgettable animated adventure,5,3 October 2021,"While well animated and taking place across a brisk runtime that never outstays its welcome, Disney's newest female hero-orientated animated property Raya and the Last Dragon fails to create much in the way of its own identity as it borrows heavily from previous animated staples (with the likes of Brave, Mulan and How to Train Your Dragon all springing to mind) on its way to crafting out a colorful and energetic fantasy adventure that never captures the hearts or minds like you had wished it to do.Following Kelly Marie Tran's Raya, a nice move for the actress after the trials and tribulations of her appearance in the last two Star Wars features, a young warrior tasked with reuniting her world after year's of warring and animosity amongst various tribes following the demise of the once dragon filled lands, Raya's familiar set-up of an orphaned child turned young woman fighting for the good of her people and family legacy never does anything we haven't seen before or done better, despite the best attempts of its enthusiastic voice cast and some fun (if slight) set-pieces.Unlike some of the best Disney properties to have existed in times long past and those still fresh in the memory, Raya herself isn't the most engaging or charming of lead characters and she's often overshadowed by the antics of Awkwafina's awakened dragon Sisu or her off-sider pet companion Tuk Tuk, while the initial intrigue about the landscapes of the land of Kumandra quickly gives way to a feeling of half-explored scenarios as Raya and Sisu set off to find missing dragon stone pieces, an adventure that never quite dons wings and makes our imaginations or hearts fly.Raya is a hard film too hate, its heart is in the right place and the animation work from Disney is as high quality as you'd have expected it to be but in a world where we are given often magical experiences through Pixar films or hilariously bonkers outings from Dreamworks and the likes, Raya feels like a secondstring player in a field of competing champions as it ends up feeling like a mid-tier effort from Disney too tick off some more culturally diverse and female lead features.There's no doubt that the youngest members of the household may find short term joy in the film, but its unlikely anyone over the age of 10 will be left with much of a lasting impression of this feature that does nothing to stand out from a crowded pack.Final Say -Never capturing the magic or imagination needed to make it a special outing for the whole family, Raya and the Last Dragon is an overly familiar Disney experience that never provides the charms, heart or laughter you'd have hoped it may've delivered.2 1/2 con-babies out of 5.",Raya and the Last Dragon
22,digitalbeachbum,Not worth the $29.99 advance viewing,1,6 March 2021,"(edit)I sort of had to sit through this a second time with the kids. They had decided to watch it again, so being in the other room I decided to push myself through the agony to see if I was wrong to trash it the first time.Hint - Nothing has changed.As with my previous review, the movie is filled with Deus ex machina. This is a writing device used by terrible writers because they really don't know how to move the plot along in a logical manner. They use the device to make things happen. Such as, if a door needs to be opened, a key suddenly shows up with out any rhyme or reason. While effective and cheap, the quality of the writing is lowered when you use this device. Unfortunately, these writers used this device through out the entire movie, and I mean in every scene.Did you notice how the Druun only show up when the good guys have something to stop them? In every scene where the Druun show up, the good guys have a piece of the gemstone or they are near water. The Druun don't show up when any character is with out a gemstone or aren't surrounded by water. This is terrible writing. There is no challenge for the characters to grow from, they have no adversity. It's like having a ""pass go, collect $200"" and ""get out of jail card"" for every scene.This is the epitome of Deus ex machina.There are countless other problems with the writing and this movie has it in Spades. That is, characters straying from their normal personalities. Raya does it constantly through out the movie just to avoid conflict or because the writers want to add some looney side kick to her crew.Her crew is a hodge podge of shallow characters who provide nothing to the development of the lead characters personality. They are just there to prevent this being a solo mission. You later have them holding the stones while Raya sacrifices herself so that Namaari learns a lesson? Then each one of them sacrifice their own selves and give the stones to Namaari? Then the dragons return and suddenly everyone is happy, all the stupid people who got turned to stone suddenly desire peace and all their problems are washed away. YEAH! YIPPIE FOR DEUS EX MACHINA!!!I see a lot of people saying the ending is incredible, but it is really sloppy writing. The ending is extremely bi-polar. Who is learning what lesson? Who is the hero? What lesson are the actually trying to teach? The lines are blurred and the lesson is lost.I don't know if anyone else sees the mistakes in the writing. For me, I'm unimpressed with the superficial writing. The plot is very weak, the characters are too. This is basically an extremely expensive Saturday morning cartoon on FX/CG steroids. I'm sure that there will be adults out there that enjoy this movie, but for me, I need more to satisfy my intelligence. I WANT MORE!And on a side note. If I ever had the opportunity to make a movie, I wouldn't foreshadow the ending of the movie in the opening credits.",Raya and the Last Dragon
23,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Say hello to the First Classic of Hollywood in 2021. Undoubtedly, Disney's Best Standalone work since the The Lion King.",8,6 March 2021,"Raya And The Last Dragon (2021) :
Movie Review -Walt Disney being an ancestor and Pioneer of Animation Films since 30s decade seemed a little down in last 2 decades. Their last universal classic came in 1994 (The Lion King) while rest of the classic were either from Pixar or with collaboration. Now, one can say it without doubt that Walt Disney has found something to be proud of in their own in the form of 'Raya And The Last Dragon'. Finally, a Classic Animated Feature for Disney without the help of Pixar and certainly their best work in the last two-and-a-half decade.Raya And The Last Dragon is a fantasy film having half the character in human forms and rest in fictional dragons form. In a realm known as Kumandra, a re-imagined Earth inhabited by an ancient civilization, a warrior named Raya is determined to find the last dragon to unite the divided kingdoms again. The storyline is very cleverly written by Qui Nguyen and Adele Lim and the screenplay too doesn't bother much despite the predictability. It has a powerful message of Trusting each other blended with high emotions which certainly works like magic and leaves you teary-eyed.At the beginning, the VFX work looked quite on low standard as we have seen in 90s but fortunately in the second session it covers the advanced and great looking visuals when the dragons portion appears. The background score by is very well composed according to the emotional surroundings while the the same has been helped by terrific sound mixing. Action scenes are fine but nothing new to be considered as path breaking in spite of having potential for the same. Raya and The Last Dragon is pushed high by the soul stirring material of human emotions where these technical things doesn't matter much hence the narrative never looks dull. It is a very simple story and predictable too, so talking more about it will only help to spoil your fun.Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada's duo provides a much needed quality film to Walt Disney Animation Studios for which they were waiting since long time. Many people termed Pixar far ahead of Disney in last 25 years and deservingly so, but with Raya And The Past Dragon Disney has cracked the same formula and hopefully they will continue making such great films in future as well. Overall, a Must See for all ages. Hollywood has got its First Classic of the year 2021 from a brand like Walt Disney so don't miss it.RATING - 8/10*",Raya and the Last Dragon
24,matthewssilverhammer,Another mediocre Disney offering,6,13 March 2021,"The stuff that works in Raya is unsurprisingly great: the world-building, impressive animation, exciting action, and a climax that pushes home a fairly unique kids-movie message about cultural understanding. On the flip side, Disney just keeps getting in its own way: hackneyed dialogue, ill-advised humor (Awkwafina is a mistake here), the video-game plot...and NO SONGS??? A disappointingly average film that doesn't warrant paying extra for on Disney+, nor is it worth breaking quarantine to see in a theater.",Raya and the Last Dragon
25,southdavid,Drag-s-on a bit.,6,23 September 2021,"I've found the last few Disney Studios animated films to be a little underwhelming, ""Frozen 2"" and ""Ralph Breaks The Internet"" were both lesser than their originals. I didn't much care for ""Zootopia"" or ""Big Hero 6"". I think I found ""Moana"" to be the best of them. ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" doesn't buck that trend, I'm afraid. It's all fine, perfectly serviceable, but ultimately forgettable stuff.The Land of Kumandra is divided into five warring tribes after the Druun are confined to a magical gem by Sisu (Akwafina), the last dragon. 500 years later, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) is training to protect the gem, that is hidden in the lands of the Heart tribe. Tricked into revealing the location to the rival tribes, the gem is broken into five pieces and the evil is released. Six years later, Raya is on a quest to reunite the gem and locate Sisu, to again trap the Drunn and resurrect those that the dark force has turned to stone.The animation is really good and the vocal work is strong. It feels like it's (deliberately) vague on precisely which Eastern traditions and cultures it's taking from, so as to not accidently offend anyone, but the story of lost parents, trust and sacrifice is as standard a Disney film plot as you're ever likely to see.Unfortunately, that lack of originality is probably what makes the film so forgettable. In each of the five towns, Raya collects both a piece of the crystal and a companion - making the film feel very much like a fetch quest Role Playing Game. I'll keep my reviews spoiler free, but specific elements of the ending have been done before by Disney too.Now, that said, I'm well above the average age for a Disney film, so just like the ones I watched as a kid, they'll be a generation that grow up loving it. Personally though, I'm looking for something to hit the ""Tangled"" levels, let alone something like ""Aladdin"" before I let it in my heart.",Raya and the Last Dragon

27,Vartiainen,Disney... what are you doing?,6,21 September 2021,"I like this film on paper. South Asian cultures represented, Asian dragons, tough warrior princess(es), martial arts, no romance subplot. There's a lot to love here.Unfortunately, this is my least favourite Disney film since Ralph Breaks the Internet. And it all comes down to execution. People who made this film have no idea what used to make Disney so timeless. It feels more like a movie written by a committee.Starting with the plot. This is not a movie plot. Rather it feels like a video game. Go around this big circular map and from each place collect a shining doohickey and a new companion. You even unlock new powers with each new thingamabob. How is that not a video game!? There's no arc, no tension. It's just one very similar scene after another until the big ending battle where of course the characters have magically learned their lesson.The dialogue is also atrocious. This film, taking place in a magical fantasy realm, actually has a line that goes ""Like, you know, I'm totally like a superfan of dragons."" That's not how fantasy princesses talk! That's how someone trying to parody a modern high school student would talk.That being said, the film looks really nice. To be honest, it looks amazing. Disney has once again managed to surpass itself in terms of quality.I also like Raya as a character and I like her rivalry with Namaari, a fellow warrior princess. Had this film focused more on their rivalry and less on the countless other companions Raya picks up along the way, I could perhaps have cared a great deal more.And even though the plot more closely resembles a video game, it's not downright awful. Truth be told, the film is fine. It's simply that I expect more from Disney. I expect heart, genuine emotion, timelessness. And in that regard, this film falls woefully short.",Raya and the Last Dragon
28,lisafordeay,Gorgeous animation story not bad.,7,5 March 2021,"Raya And The Last Dragon is the latest Disney Movie featuring the voices of Kelly Marie Tran,Awkwarfina and Gemma Chan.

As well as this its not your typical princess falls for a prince throwing in songs every 15 minutes. It was all about family and independence. Is it the best film in the world no,is it original,well half the time it reminded me of Mulan 1998 meets How To Train Your Dragon mixing in Avengers Endgame where each piece of the gems were in different parts of the land.If you are looking for a typical fairytale with a bunch of songs and a handsome prince than you ain't gonna find it here.

30,stevendbeard,Great Disney Movie,8,7 March 2021,"I saw ""Raya and the Last Dragon"", starring the voices of Kelly Marie Tran-the Star Wars movies, XOXO; Awkwafina-Jumanji:The Next Level, Crazy Rich Asians; Gemma Chan-Captain Marvel, Crazy Rich Asians and Daniel Dae Kim-Hellboy_2019, Lost_tv.
This is a great Disney movie that has a short feature before the main movie begins-it's about an older couple that get their groove back. In the main story, dragons get along with humans a lot better than the humans do with other humans. About 500 years ago, the humans were divided into about 5 different clans, each fighting with each other as to who is the best clan. An evil mist like entity called the Druun pop up and start to menace the land-people would turn to stone at their touch. To protect the humans-and themselves-the dragons team up to get rid of the Druun but it cost them severely. All but one, Awkwafina, were turned to stone and Awkwafina just disappeared after the final battle. Jump to the present and the Druun resurface and Kelly goes on a quest to find Awkwafina and get her to help get rid of the menace again. Daniel plays Kelly's father and Gemma is from a rival clan that is trying to stop Kelly. The animation is top of the line. It also has some good martial arts fights-for those that are interested in the martial arts-and plenty of comedy, to boot. I liked the con baby, in particular. There is also a lesson or two to be learned.
It's rated ""PG"" for action and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes.
I really liked it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The storyline focuses on a girl whose family is responsible for protecting a stone that keeps peace in the world and has powers. Other tribes feel that the stone brings the family and their people prosperity and they are jealous. The other tribes invade the castle, break the stone and steal the pieces. Follow Raya as she sets out to right the wrongs of the jealous and restore order. This movie is directed by Don Hall (Big Hero), Carlos Lopez Estrada (Summertime) and two other directors and has voices provided by Kelly Marie Tran (The Croods: New Age), Alan Tudyk (I, Robot), Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians) and Gemma Chan (Eternals). The storyline for this picture had a lot of potential and was fun to watch unfold. I loved the depiction of the relationship between father and daughter and the coming of age and maturity of Raya throughout the picture. The settings, animation and premise ""of be careful who you trust"" and ""believe in the goodness of people"" is well delivered. I can't say I loved the dragon in this at all. I actually thought it was the worst part of the movie and the most annoying character. I went into this optimistic this would be really good based on the greatness of Moana; however, this falls way short of that masterpiece.

33,alindsay-al,A Good Formulaic Film,7,4 June 2021,"So this film has finally been put on Disney+ at no extra cost and I watched Raya and the Last Dragon today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young woman go on a hunt for the last dragon and a way to unite the kingdom of Kumandra.Main Character
Kelly Marie Tran voices Raya and she is a really good character. She is your typical Disney heroine but there is no doubt that the formula works and she is somebody that you will support and want to see succeed. She is a great action hero that has an actual character arc which is pretty well realised and makes her a cool and memorable character.Supporting Characters
This film has a legit voice cast. Awkwafina voices The Last Dragon and the dynamic between her and Raya is one of the large parts of the film, she does go a bit over the top at times and this is no Aladdin and Genie but it works well enough. Gemma Chan voices Raya's rival and she does a good job and the conflict between them is also a well done part of the film and risen up by the quality of voice actor. Daniel Dae Kim, Sandra Oh and Benedict Wong al all do good jobs in their roles and add plenty to the lore of the film and the characters.Story
The story is okay, it is cool seeing the different elements of the culture and the fun adventure quest between a likeable group of characters as they go to these places. But there is no denial that this film is pretty cliché and formulaic, there were scenes that I predicted what was going to happen before it happened and that was disappointing. I get that the Disney formula does work, but it is 2021 and maybe some risks need to be taken in order to make it stand out from the rest.Script
The script has some nice heart-warming moments and comedic elements in it that again feels like it fits the world that is being portrayed on screen. But again, some of the comedy is repetitive and dull with the drama feeling again like you have seen it before and it doesn't bring enough new to the table.Style
The film has a really good style about it, the computer graphics is mind blowing and it is amazing how animation has developed as the technology has. The action scenes are glorious and the colour pallets and design are really great to look at. I just feel like this film has a slight pacing problem, the middle act for me wasn't that great and felt like it transitioned between locations quite quickly and failed to keep me as interested as the first and last acts did.Overall
Overall, Raya and the Last Dragon is a good film. It plays itself a bit safe and you have seen the overall themes before but it is a fun family film that is a good watch for sure.",Raya and the Last Dragon
34,CubsandCulture,Awkwafina has a great turn in this.,8,9 August 2021,"There are a couple of aspects of the story that standout among the Disney canon. The characters are a little more complex; both that they are conflicted and that the characters are all have more moral nuance. The Asian cultural trappings standout but Dreamworks got there first with Kung Fu Panda. But overall the story goes exactly how you expect it to go. There's no surprise in any of the major story beats.The animation is beautiful but the design feels like Mulan rendered in 3d. There's not a lot of personality to this film visual level. It is Zen imagery and epic landscapes that we have seen before. In fact a lack of personality is a good way to explain this film-an engaging film that is missing a critical different spark to make it special.The film comes close to this spark with
Awkwafina's vocal work. She is wonderfully daft, funny and touching in this. But the character is much more of a sidekick than a protagonist and there's not enough material with the dragon.",Raya and the Last Dragon

39,aidanratesmovies,Mixed Feelings About This One,5,13 June 2021,"Far from Disney's worst, but lacking its much needed execution, Raya and the Last Dragon is a rather standard animated affair with occasional sparks of brilliance. Now let me just start off with saying that this films script is a mess. Honestly there are several moments throughout the film where I was just like, well that was pointless filler, but in terms of story there is just so much it isn't easily handled into this format. Somewhere in the heart of this film there is something great and magical, but it is just so cluttered with useless nonsense at times and trying so hard to get its message out that it completely misses its own point. I feel the film would have been much better told if it were in a different format, a tv show maybe? I know it's far past a usual budget, but it's the only way I can see the story being executed properly- considering its elements and potential. As frustrated as I am with the film though for lacking 'greatness' there are several good things about it. The music is pretty well done, and the ending wraps things up quite beautifully- if not as effective as it could have been. By far its strongest asset though is its animation, which is absolutely stunning all the way throughout. We do struggle a bt with blandness of th character designs, some even feeling a bit familiar, but there is no doubt the film is incredibly visually impressive and is some of the best animated artwork Disney has produced in quite some time. Some action scenes can be quite intense, mainly ones towards the end of the film, and the ones before are usually a generic hodgepodge of tough guy talk and cliche garbage we have seen a million times over before. The characters are quite a bit thin at times, I feel oddly enough the dragon has the most depth of any character in the film, and I would have much preferred to see this story told through her eyes rather than Raya. In the end it's far from perfect, but Raya and the Last Dragon is a technical marvel. It doesn't quite reach its potential, but it does have its strengths. If you are looking for something similar and better to watch, I suggest Laika's Kubo and the Two Strings.My Rating:5/10.",Raya and the Last Dragon

REVIEW:Disney is a studio that can bring a lot of things to the table, and Raya's adventure is another shining example of that ability. Comedy wise the movie manages to hit many right nodes for me, starting with adorable interactions with animals and our heroine to get the mood of fun started. After some darker moments, the movie then sheds the first set of scales and unleashes the comedy in many forms including slapstick, ninja babies with their humanistic monkeys, and adult sayings at the most unexpected moments. Awkwafina's ramblings work quite well in the film, and balanced with the other characters, provides balanced amusement that does not get in the way of the writing/story. The other voice actors help as well, each providing their own flavor to their characters that is fitting, fun, and surprisingly representative of the regions stereotypical personalities explained in the film. Tran did well in those intense moments, hitting those tense moments of heroism with just the right touch of pride and power, and diving deep into the despair when things hit snag. Gemma Chan's rogue edge in her voice made her character the perfect antagonist to Raya's journey, and yet had layers that peeled away with each chapter of the saga. All of the actors mix well, and it makes the characters fun to ride the boat with down the river of Kumara.
Outside of the comedy and voice acting though, Raya's tale has a lot of other powerful features within its animated cells. Music wise, the movie succeeds in representing the culture well, beautiful orchestral pieces with a Southeast Asian mix sets the setting and maximizes emotion in the sequences and helping elevate the story. It also has a few tracks for those to listen on replay for the next several weeks, and I liked them too. Transitioning to the story, Raya's tale has a lot of components that will bring excitement to families alike. The adventure as I mentioned is fun, but like so many of the House of Mouse's movies has morals that hit deep for this reviewer. Trust, faith, confidence, and unity are just some of the themes that will come to play and though a bit cheesy in some of the monologues, but manages to contain itself and with the use of other components manages to deliver the blow to hopefully inspire and teach the important lessons we all need a refresher course on. That was perhaps the strongest part of the story for me if I'm being honest.
-Finally the biggest strength of the film for me comes in the form of the animation of this film. As many people have said to me, no shock that Disney can animate, but this movie has a little more oomph to it than some of the other animated films I've seen in the last few years. On the 4K setting, the contrast pops, fluid movements getting an extra level of detail and shine that makes it feel more realistic, despite the cartoon undertones this film has. Water, grass, even the sand at points looks very realistic, a nod to the mastery of environments with computer animation compared to what we once did thirty years ago. Character wise the realism takes a step back, but the design of our main cast gets creative as the physique sort of matches the voice actors talents and again the area to which they call home. Raya's balanced body to represent the valley that lies in the center of the island, or Namaari's edges, angles and physique needed for the greatest war nation of the land. It's attentions to detail like that I like, and seeing such an odd band come together helps bring out some anime themes that help bring out the laughs. In regards to the movements of the cast... again they succeed with so much complexity added past running and talking. Sisu's movements as a dragon are beautiful, smooth like la snake, but with the magic adds sparkle and dynamic physiology I think that mirrored well. The monkey that accompany baby ninja Noi have a blend of human and monkey that are elegant to match the ninja job, but still clumsy to allow for that comedic flaw. Yet the biggest plus for me in regards to the animation is the action/fight scenes. Disney's animation studios have pulled punches in the past, choosing words and repetitive shots of the same magic, as quick bouts of conflict resolution occur. Raya has a bit of that, but takes a step back towards the 80s-90s action scenes and makes me believe they've got more adventures to come. No it's not mortal kombat, or a fight scene from the Marvel Universe, but there are times where the fights really dive into the martial arts realm, emotional tension and all. Various styles get mixed in to the scenes, and from my limited experience, several of the stances matched quite well to what I saw in this film. =It added some spice to the story, made for a better conclusion, and surprisingly led to better character development than some of the dialogue tried to force.But all the good and details I put in to the likes, there are some flaws that Disney still has not returned to in the modern era. One is the rushed plot, an opening that started out well balanced and detail, suddenly shifted to gear four and so many things happened in the blink of an eye. The adventure itself moved a bit too quickly for my tastes, and despite the potential of each land on this treasure hunt holding great potential, I felt that we moved through most of the lands faster than intended and as a result missed out on some creative magic that Disney has pulled out before, while also expanding on the world they were building up in the opening prologue. In turn this led to character development being inconsistent for me as well. Raya and Namaari get a good bit of the evolution and dive into their characters and personal beliefs, but the other members of the gang felt a bit shallower despite all the advertisements building them up. Much like Wonder Woman introducing characters net me the expectation they will be used to the full extent and I felt more could have been done with many of the characters. More action of course is going to be requested by this action junkie, who though got some good scenes, wanted more at various parts of the films. Raya has a segment describing the ferocity of the tribes and their weapons and yet... so many moments were diluted down to just showing off weapons. I'd have liked to have seen the skill set come in handy, or at least expand the world with some traps or environmental hazards that they had to overcome to collect the relics they sought. This sort of brings me to the biggest issues with the film that made me feel the time spent in the five kingdoms was wasted, the impasses or mainly lack of impasses. All the animosity and danger this world held was surprisingly tame in the movie, and the ease to which Raya and the troupe moved through these supposed guarded kingdoms was too easy for my taste. Perhaps a time constraint, perhaps censorship to kids, or maybe budget put the limitations on them, but I could envision several more exciting ordeals they could have gone through to up the challenge level and include characters into the mix. This is probably the truest for the dreaded Drunes, the evil spirits this ordeal centers on, who look like billowing clouds of purple and black gas. Yeah, you heard me right gas, and though the design is not the most sensational, the use of them is rather lacking even though the opening promised they would be a much bigger threat. Raya needed to balance these things a little more for their inclusion to be relevant, but they at least acted as the medium to get the morals out so not a total loss.The VERDICT:
Rambling done, Raya is still an impressive piece of work with a lot of soul, culture, and beauty in its design and storytelling. A heartfelt, moral driven tale, the inspirational piece has comedy, adventure, and family drama that will capture so much of the target audience to entertain them for the near 2 hour run time. With great design and fantastic animation, including some decent action scenes, you might just be impressed as I was with Walt Disney's dive back into darker territories and edgier adventures. But this dive is still in the shallow end for the movie feels very rushed with inconsistent character development given all the buildup the ads and prologue delivered. A beautiful world that needs expanding on, especially in regards to the challenge/impasses to hinder their journey, the adventure side of Raya could have been elevated to bring out the full adventure scale. The challenge feels absent, and the creativity not fully reached that I know Disney has handed out in the past. Still, this movie is well worth a watch, whether at home or theater, and I believe will hold a spot in the modern Disney hall of fame for years to come. My s",Raya and the Last Dragon
43,rannynm,"Fascinating setting and mythology, slightly faltering storyline",8,4 March 2021,"In terms of world-building, Raya and the Last Dragon is probably one of Disney's best. This animated film has a fascinating setting and mythology; however the story falters a little.This film takes place in Kumandra, a world comprising five divided nations. When an evil force known as The Druun sends Kumandra into a state of despair, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) sets out on a journey to find the last dragon, and defeat The Druun for good.First, the animation in this film is strong and very realistic; perhaps a little too realistic to the point where some shots look like photographs. This might be a pet peeve of mine, because I don't like ultra-realistic animation. Sure, it is impressive, technologically speaking, but I find stylized animation to be much more striking and memorable. Aside from that, it's very beautiful. I really like the colors, and how each location is so visually distinct.Raya and the Last Dragon feels a lot more dramatic and serious in tone than most other Disney films. On the one hand, I really enjoy this as I believe we need more serious kids' movies. However, I'm assuming the producers were concerned about this film being ""too dark for kids"" because there is a lot of really unfunny comedy in the beginning. This comedy mostly comes from Sisu (Awkwafina), the last dragon. And while I'm usually a fan of Awkwafina and her comedic timing, she's just not given any good material here. The jokes don't fit with the setting or tone, and they really bog down Sisu's first few scenes. Yet once the comedy slows down, she becomes a more dramatic character which I enjoyed.I have a few concerns with the themes of Raya and the Last Dragon. The message that, instead of being divided, we need to come together and stand united is fine. However the execution of that message is a bit questionable. No spoilers, but let's just say a certain character really deserved some repercussions for all the problems they caused. I do understand that the moral is that we should learn to trust each other, but I feel like that message is used as an excuse to not properly redeem a character.I give Raya and The Last Dragon 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18.

I honestly expected them to fight over the magic thing, but the incompetence of stealing a thing that keeps the world from ending, let alone breaking it into pieces is a bit much. It actually pushes it over into a horror movie territory, and it shows at one point.There was also the bit where they show us a movie they skipped before this one, but it may not have been the best to start a franchise.This movie feels like an old timey fable, it gets dark, and there is a lesson to be learned.I found it full of fun, adventure and action, not to mention top quality animation.

Hero goes off in search of a McGuffin and along the way meets new friends and learns a valuable lesson. First of all the animation is stunning. The action scenes were amazing. The way characters move and their surroundings was gorgeous. The production and characters designs were just spectacular. There's also a multi-purpose sword that is fantastic. The score was also really good, with moments of uplifting epicness. The voice cast is mostly great. The only voice that didn't work for me was Awkwafina as the dragon Sisu. Some of her lines were funny, but to be honest I found her slightly annoying. And the story does get a tad repetitious after a while, like a video game where we're simply going to each new place to retrieve a new part of the dragon gem. All in all, Raya and the last dragon is clearly not one of Disney's best work but great visuals, voice work and soundtrack makes it definitely worth a watch.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Everything is super predictable and there is not much originality, but the execution makes for a good final product. My only real problem with it is the blended ""southeast Asian"" feel mixing Thai, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Filipino elements rather than just representing one of the countries/cultures... it feels like one of them alone was not good enough they had to create a made up world mixing all of them (vs. Brave being clearly Irish, Mulan clearly Chinese, Coco clearly Mexican, etc.).",Raya and the Last Dragon
49,brchthethird,One of the better latter-day Disney efforts,7,27 July 2021,"I've been gradually souring on Disney for a variety of reasons, some of which colored my enjoyment here. Most pertinent is the needless complexity of something directed at children, only to cheat by giving it the same simplistic happy ending. That being said, the technical aspects are impeccable. Computer animation will always pale in comparison to hand-drawn cel animation, but it hasn't looked better than it does here. I also found the banter to be entertaining, if a little ADD (Awkwafina as Sisu being the worst offender). For latter-day Disney, this was pretty good. Certainly better than FROZEN. I also appreciate the effort to depict other (read: non-Western) cultures in a sensitive light. And despite what I said about complexity, there was a good message at its heart.",Raya and the Last Dragon
50,IonicBreezeMachine,Solid enough foundation helps overcome a mixed delivery.,7,26 July 2021,"Set in the world of Khumandra, the film follows Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) princess of the Khumandra's Heart tribe who travels the desolate landscape of Khumandra after the four other tribes (spine, fang, talon and tail) shattered the Dragon Gem unleashing the plague of the Druun that has turned much of Khumandra's populace to stone. Raya finds Sisu (Awkwafina) the last dragon to help her on her quest to reunite the shards of the Dragon Gem, wile evading Namaari (Gemma Chan) the princess of dominant Fang tribe who also wishes to acquire the shards.The newest ""Princess movie"" from Walt Disney Animation Studios, this time around the studio mines Southeast Asian mythology and culture for their latest opus. Directed by Don Hall of Winnie the Pooh and Big Hero 6 and co-directed by Carlos López Estrada of Blindspotting, the movie definitely has a more than proven creative team behind the camera, as well as a varied and proven cast. While the movie is overall quite good, it does stumble a bit in its introduction.The animation as expected is beautiful. With art direction inspired various Southeast Asian cultures (Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, etc.) the film creates a unique world that fits well within Disney's oeuvre with some absolutely gorgeous characters and environmental designs with flowing and smooth animation. The scenes with Sisu flying and swimming are particularly amazing as they show grace in both movement and design that is awe inspiring. The action beats are well paced with fluid motion and well conveyed impacts and strikes and there's some nice influence that can be traced back not only to anime and anime inspired works, but also martial arts based affairs such as Ong Bok and Chocolate.The execution of the story is where things stumble. While the broad strokes of the story are perfectly fine on paper with a well developed world and mythology, I feel like the movie does a spotty job at introducing the audience to its world. An aspect that I really didn't like was the overly modernistic dialogue that infests the film's opening act with usages of terms such as ""Dragon Nerd"" and exchanges that feels way too contemporary and self-aware. There's a large number of contemporary delivers and references that just fall completely flat, and I think to a degree these are trying to capture the appeal seen with Robin Williams' Genie in Aladdin. 30 years after the fact that Genie still haunts Disney movies with ill advised attempts to recapture it (gargoyles from Notre Dame, Mushu from Mulan, pretty much EVERYTHING in Hercules, etc.) and it's pretty clear that Disney doesn't understand why it worked in the first place and just feels the need to shoehorn it in. There's no individual element I can point to with this issue as it's basically spread across multiple characters and deliveries with Awkwafina feeling rather jarring with her choice of delivery for the Dragon Sisu. If I'm being honest I think it was the worst first impression I'd had of a movie of this type since Pixar's Brave.The movie does eventually course correct around the beginning of the 2nd act. While there are still overly contemporary exchanges that break immersion there are fewer of them as the movie does try to go for more scenes based on character and atmosphere. Some scenes still feel a touch too self-aware for my taste including a rather out of place scene referencing Ocean's Eleven style caper sequences, but it does play more to its strengths in these sequences.Raya and the Last Dragon isn't one of Disney Animations best, but it's also far from their worst. The movie's plot and design clearly had effort and care put into them, but the delivery that takes an on the nose contemporaneous bent makes itself really distracting especially in the opening. The movie does regain it's footing after its clumsy third act, and while I enjoyed it more than Brave it fell short of the mark of Moana or Tangled.",Raya and the Last Dragon

54,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Another visually stunning Disney movie that attempts to tell an Asian-inspired story.,7,20 August 2021,"For a studio that built itself on Euro-centric fairy tales and stories, I can appreciate how Disney is (finally) trying to make movies that explore other cultures of the world. While not necessarily based in any lore from Asian countries, Raya and the Last Dragon (2021) pulls enough aesthetic influence from these cultures to be a nice homage. As always, I'm stunned at the visuals Disney can produce with CGI, and Raya and the Last Dragon is no exception to this rule. Add to this the incredibly well-choreographed fight sequences, and this film certainly had its moments.However, what's weird about Raya and the Last Dragon is how parts of it felt done before. Kung Fu Panda (2008) might not have had realistic humans using martial arts techniques. Still, the choreography for this kind of animated movie was already there more than a decade before Raya came along. Similarly, the ""collect all the pieces of a thing"" storyline is such a common trope among fantasy stories that it seemed a little uninspired. This, combined with the ""unintentionally gather a rag-tag group of individuals"" flow of the story made me check out about halfway through.While most of these side characters were quirky, I found the titular ""last Dragon"" Sisu (Awkwafina) to be a bit annoying. Granted, I realize most of these characters are trying to appeal to children, but something about how her character acted made it feel like an anachronism of the era. This probably contributed to my lack of emotion at the moments that would have called for it. Then again, the predictable story beats didn't help with this either. Still, I'll watch movies like this for the visual spectacle alone, so the fact that not everything worked for me is fine.Another visually stunning Disney movie that attempts to tell an Asian-inspired story, I give Raya and the Last Dragon 3.5 stars out of 5.",Raya and the Last Dragon

56,bankofmarquis,"Strong Animation and Voice Work overcomes ""Standard"" Plot",8,25 September 2021,"One of the first films to be released (both in theaters and on-line) during the pandemic, RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON came and went quickly - certainly ignored in the movie theaters, and with very little fanfare on-line.And that's too bad for RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON is a fun, fantastical and visually rich tapestry that weaves together strong characters, a good lesson and enough action and comedy to keep young and old alike engaged throughout.RAYA tells the story of the land of Kumandra, a realm that was inspired by Southeast Asian countries (such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia) a land that is split into 5 parts that each face the same threat, but instead of banding together to fight this threat, they are splintered and selfish and look out only for their own - with little to no regard of the consequences to others.Sound familiar? While the film was imagined and realized before the pandemic, the themes of this film reverberate strongly in this post-pandemic world that we live in.Into this world drops Raya who, when betrayed by one she sees as a friend, sets out on a quest to find the last dragon and unify the 5 lands. It's a typical ""quest film"" but one that is told with such heart and charm - with strong voice characters and beautiful animation - that I was won over by it.Kelly Marie Tran (Rose Tico in the latest STAR WARS trilogy) brings Raya's voice to life and it is a one that is embodied with hope, naivete and strength and really makes you root for her character. The voice work by the likes of Gemma Chan (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS), Benedict Wong (DR. STRANGE), DANIEL DAE KIM (TV's LOST) and Sandra OH (TV's GREY'S ANATOMY) are all as equally strong and nuanced and draws you into each of their characters and the story.And then there is Awkwafina (SHANG-CHI) as the voice of The Last Dragon - she is on another level. It is not hyperbole to say that this voicework/character is on a par with David Spade's work as Kuzco in THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE and much like Spade, she ad-libbed much of her dialogue. It's not quite at the level of Robin Williams in ALADDIN, but it's in that ballpark - it is that good. This character makes or breaks this film and AWKWAFINA nails it - and makes the film.This film is a ""non-Musical"" and I think that works well here. While this choice may turn off some families from viewing, this choice makes it a stronger film and is the right selection.And then, there is the animation, which is even more impressive considering it was created from the animators in their homes during the pandemic. RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON is a visual feast, weaving imagery and beautifully animated scenes throughout - I applaud those that made this incredibly beautiful film under such adverse conditions, it is a triumph.All-in-all RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON is well worth checking out, despite the plot being rather ""standard"", the themes, characters, voice work and animation are all top notch - what one has come to expect from Disney Animation.Letter Grade: A- (did I mention that the plot is rather ""standard"")8 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Raya and the Last Dragon
57,Animany94,Tank the remakes and let's have good movies like this.,9,17 March 2021,"Raya And The Last Dragon proves that Disney is still capable of telling powerful stories with beautiful animation and lovable characters.Characters are each relatable with how the magical world of Kumandra split their families and left them either on their own, haunted by issues trusting people, stealing to survive or a combination of two or more.Main character Raya and Namari being the most compelling with their personal connection, but not much about any character seems out of place. The titular dragon can be a little awkward when Awkwafina tries to be funny, but that's minor.Action packed, heart-felt and immersive non-musical from Disney which shows that if they actually try, we can get new original content for us to cherish for years to come instead of rehashed and hollow remakes of older properties for quick bucks to be forgotten immediately afterwards.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Lots of Thailandish style architectures and character costumes. The animators did an amazing job with capturing Awkwafina's personality with the Sisu dragon, both as a dragon and a human animated character.The screenplay was a meh, seen better from Disney like Soul (2020). Raya and the Last Dragon feels sorta like an animated version of Divergent/Hunger Games meets Indiana Jones. The humor is parched. Not a whole lot of laughs, but it is what it is and this is a children's film.

64,kjproulx,A Beautifully Animated Film with Too Much Familiarity,7,9 March 2021,"Whether you're talking about great films like Zootopia, Big Hero 6, or Moana, Disney animation continues to deliver rich and fresh stories, along with gorgeous animation. If for nothing else, the fact that they still continue to put out great animated films is what keeps me interested in what comes next. Raya and the Last Dragon is their latest release, now in theatres and available on Disney+. Being an original concept, I was very eager to witness this one, but unfortunately, it seemed far too familiar in many regards. Disney's latest major animated release is rich in terms of the world surrounding the story but is lacks flare in many other areas. Here are my thoughts on Raya and the Last Dragon.The first few minutes of the film sets up that the land of Kumandra was once peaceful and prosperous, with humans and dragons living and working together. After an event shattered their livelihood, the dragons all sacrificed themselves to keep the humans alive. This in turn created a divide and the land broke off into multiple tribes. Many years later, a young woman in Raya is determined to find the last remaining dragon in hopes to restore what once was. This premise is the blueprint for many other films, so the film already had me sighing when the first act concluded.Before I dive into the main reason this film bothered me, this is a very well-done movie by all involved. The animation (as always from Disney) is utterly beautiful to look at and the score by James Newton Howard felt very inspired and elevated each scene for me. The musical cues had my heart pounding. I was, even more, looking forward to this film due to its directors. I know there was some drama surrounding the making of this film, but having Don Hall (who is very familiar with working with animation) and Carlos Lopez Estrada (who made one of my favourite films of 2018 in Blindspotting) helming the project was music to my ears.I really enjoyed watching this film, but where it slightly failed/disappointed me was in the fact that it didn't take many risks. Endangered loved ones, tribes against each other while one outstanding person wants to make everything right, and a human befriending a creature are all things that have been done time and time again. These things can all be forgiven when a film puts a fresh take on them, but in the end, it all played out exactly as I expected. By the time the credits rolled, I found myself admiring the look, feel, and overall message the film delivered for kids, but I absolutely wish it had given me more.Overall, Raya and the Last Dragon is the prime example of how truly stellar animation can look. There are times when I didn't even feel like I was watching an animated film. I can't recommend this film to kids enough, because I believe the messages are more than worth their time. In that respect, this film is terrific, but in terms of doing something new and different, it just didn't do it for me. There are a lot of positives here to write home about, but I don't think it's a must-see or anything that requires immediate attention.",Raya and the Last Dragon
65,Movi3DO,The Good ol Disney Formula Still Works Spectacularly,9,8 March 2021,"So it's Thanos's snap but everyone turned into stone. In a world where dragons are essential for life, Raya, a guardian of the dragon gem, tried to unite all the pieces of the gem as well as the people of all the nations.The movie's progression was pretty typical of a Disney animated movie. I was not too surprised at many of the plot moments throughout the movie. Also, some of the early set up point of the movie was a bit weird, but that was a bit nitpicky.That's pretty much the negative, which were minor. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie. The animation is gorgeous with so much color. Surprisingly, the sword and hand fighting scenes had amazing choreography and camera work to make each fight intense and entertaining.The comedy was on point. Awkwafina, who played a character that I didn't expect, provided the majority of the comedy with her speed talking and snappy lines. She was so amazing and I loved every scene she was in. The other supporting characters were also funny and unexpected.Not only was the movie funny, but it was quite emotional. The theme of trust and unity were heavily emphasized. The movie delivered these theme effectively using smart premises, like dividing nations into parts of a dragon, so a unified league of the nations became a complete dragon. I was surprised at how much I cared for the main characters and felt quite emotional at the end.Overall, even though the the movie used the typical Disney plot, the masterful execution of many aspects elevated the experience and entertainment for the whole runtime. Definitely watch this. For sure one of the best movies this year for me. 9/10",Raya and the Last Dragon
66,Carycomic,A commendable fable for our current times.,9,23 May 2021,"As noted elsewhere, the fantasy world of Kumondra is an amalgam of various Southeast Asian countries. Particularly, Indonesia, as the very name ""Kumondra"" seems to be a composite of ""Komodo"" and ""Sumatra."" But, like in Mel Gibson's ""Mad Max"" trilogy, the world has been ecologically devastated. Although, not by an atomic war. Rather, a race of sentient energy beings called ""The Droon"" are sucking the life out of it by literally petrifying the people who make up its five surviving kingdoms!Every single one of which is named after a draconic body part.Enter Raya, daughter of Chief Benja, petrified leader of the Kingdom of Heart. She begins her quest to eradicate the Droon by making like Mad Max (who was, himself, a sci-fi pastiche of Clint Eastwood's ""Man With No Name""). By that, I mean she's initially a bitterly cynical lone wolf. But, in bringing back to life one of the Chinese-style dragons who achieved Pyrrhic victory over the Droon five centuries earlier, she sets in motion a chain of circumstances that will gradually teach her that some problems can only be solved through a pooling of resources (a.k.a. ""working together to overcome individual differences"").Especially commendable, in light of May being Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month, is the fact that the voices of the characters are supplied by actual Asian-American actors! Although, I have to be honest; the only reason I only give this nine stars, instead of a perfect ten, is due to Awkwafina's vocal styling for Sisu.Was it purely by accident that it sounded like Fran Drescher imitating Whoopie Goldberg?

72,MrDHWong,Yet another enticing action adventure we should expect by now from such a famous company,9,18 March 2021,"""Raya and the Last Dragon"" is a 3D animated feature film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. Featuring the voices of Kelly Marie Tran and Awkwafina, it is yet another enticing action adventure we should expect by now from such a famous company.In the ancient fertile land of Kumandra, the evil Druun spirits suddenly emerge to devastate everything, turning any and all people in their path into stone. To put a stop to this, the five guardian dragons create an orb with their fading power but end up becoming stone themselves as a result. Kumandra is soon divided into five different tribes: Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon, and Tail, with each believing they are entitled to wield the orb's power, causing war and conflict among the inhabitants. Five hundred years later, the Druun have returned and Raya (voiced by Kelly Marie Tran), the brave daughter of the Heart tribe's head chief, sets out to track down the last surviving dragon and finally end the Druun's destructive ways.There's very little to say about Disney animated features that hasn't already been said many times before. They have the power to wow us with alluring visuals, endear us with likeable characters, and draw us in with interesting stories. ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" is a wonderful example of how Disney continues to follow this template to bring us one of the most entertaining 3D animated films in recent years. From the very beginning, this film brimmed with so much heart and soul that I completely forgot this is the same company that made the flavourless remake of Mulan. In fact, I found more excitement in this film's first five minutes than I did the entire duration of that 2020 reimagining. I especially enjoyed the way the film established the type of world the characters live in; a post-apocalyptic kingdom of warring tribes built on Asian mythology and core principles. It really gives off the sense that so much is a stake for everyone involved in trying to bring peace to the land. Of course, this does leave the film open for unfavourable comparisons to other similar stories, like Avatar: The Last Airbender and even Game of Thrones, and this is perhaps the film's biggest issue: a lack of originality. Although the idea of different tribes and kingdoms being at war with each other is a timeless concept, here it feels more like a throwaway plot device that adds nothing new to the film's story. However, this is the only major problem I had with the film, as just about everything else more than makes up for it.Visually, this is one of Disney's best looking 3D animated films to date, at least for one that wasn't made by Pixar. From the dark and brooding atmosphere of a Druun devastated landscape to a bright and vibrant rice field filled with healthy green grass, the attention to detail can be seen in every frame. There were even moments where I had to resist the temptation to pause the film to take a screenshot to use as my desktop wallpaper, and believe me, with a film as gorgeous to look at as this, that was easier said than done. The character animations looked great as well, with each tribe member having distinct individual quirks that set them apart, like their own unique hairstyles or the muscular build of their warriors, and this made it easier to distinguish them from all the others. Additionally, the water in this movie looked strikingly real as well, especially during scenes that required rain to fall. They reminded me of the water scenes in the recent ""Frozen II"", which was also a visual treat for the eyes, and this appears to signify that 3D animated films have reached the point where it has perfected water effects.The voice cast of primarily Asian actors all did a superb job in their respective roles. Kelly Marie Tran truly stands out the most as the titular Raya, playing her as not only headstrong and adventurous, but also as a vulnerable young woman who isn't afraid to show her sensitive side when necessary. It's nice to see that Tran now has a proper outlet to showcase her talents as an actress, albeit in voiceover form, especially after the undeserved hostile reception she received in the aftermath of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"". Awkwafina was also fun to watch as Sisu, the last remaining dragon who has a bit of a mischievous streak. In spite of her silliness, Sisu was still a character you could take seriously whenever she needed to communicate any of her backstory to Raya or anyone else who may be listening. This film has a solid balance between light-hearted amusement and sincere thematic elements, and I believe we can owe this to how well the cast handles each scene with the correct amount of emotional weight.In conclusion, if you're willing to forgive it for rehashing cliched plot elements from other movies and TV shows, this film earns its place standing alongside various other Disney greats. It still has plenty for audiences of all ages to enjoy and that has been what has helped the company endure on for so many years. The visual effects and voice acting alone make it well worth the price of admission and shows a promising future for 3D animation. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some screenshots to take.I rate it 8.5/10",Raya and the Last Dragon
73,meydiana-65242,Raya and The Last Dragon Flies By Too Fast?,8,12 March 2021,"Raya and The Last Dragon Flies By Too Fast?
After watching Raya and the Last Dragon for the first time in theaters, I felt a bit of a rush going into this film. Now take as it may, almost everything was absolutely on point. When you deal with a pretty fast pace however, it is hard to connect with the film's merits. Raya and the Last Dragon had some amazing animation. From the fluidity of the water to well-motioned action sequences. In addition, the characters were absolutely enjoyable to watch. Especially the last dragon herself, Sisu. It was certainly a great sight to see! I just wished that the movie could have presented it in a bit of a slower pace. Instead, I felt like I was playing a game of leap frog with each scene jumping into the next. Going from one location to other, introducing a new character after the other, you name it. It all happens so fast, and I really wished this whole adventure could last just a little bit longer! Now this could just be me talking and someone else might get a different experience watching. No matter though, Raya and the Last Dragon is good start to 2021 animation cinema and I encourage general audiences to watch this. Just don't snore to the movie's ending in the theater like the father that was behind me. You will surprised how this all wraps up. 8/10",Raya and the Last Dragon

As a result, it is easy to get sucked in (and even a little moved). But I did not get sucked in enough to ignore the gaping plot holes...or predictable Disney storyline...or Awkwafina's over the top presence throughout. So the movie is a mixed bag.",Raya and the Last Dragon
75,elicopperman,Disappointing Adventure with Too Much Going On,5,11 July 2021,"Back in 2020, Walt Disney Animation Studios was gearing up their first original feature film since Moana in 2016, an epic adventure based on traditional Southeast Asian cultures called Raya and the Last Dragon. Unfortunately, the film had to be delayed to March of 2021 due to the coronavirus, and was not met positively over it being for sale on Disney + for three whole months and for the Southeastern Asian audience to not even have the streaming service available. So now that it's been a few months since its disappointing release, how does it favor overall? Well, let's just say it missed the mark more times than it hit.The main premise of the film centers around a warrior princess named Raya who seeks out the fabled last dragon Sisu, all within the hopes of restoring the dragon gem that can banish the plague Druun and reunite the tribes together as Kumandra. From that logline alone, the whole film seems like the perfect setup for a truly epic adventure, and to give credit where all is needed, the story does have all the right elements in place. In addition to the whole world being built around a mystical dragon gem that can protect different regions and tribes from a horrific plague, all of the characters feel appropriately laid out based on how much they want to bring forth a better tomorrow. Every region that Raya and the people she meets along the way end up in establishes the film's main theme of knowing who to trust and who to avoid, especially within such elaborately designed buildings and landscapes. Not to mention, the needed action sequences for the kind of stakes these places would ensue are well spread out to help pick up the slack, so all the ingredients are there to make this adventure worth the while.However, the two biggest aspects of the movie that completely ruin all of its potential are the rushed pacing and overly complicated execution. Because of all the different elements that are needed to tell the story, the feature ends up wasting no time getting from one scene to the next just to course through the already overly detailed plot. As a result, the film ends up establishing way too many characters and archetypes far too soon, almost as if some sequences were fully conceived movies that got heavily edited somewhere in the production phase. Not only does Raya have to deal with the enemy tribes threatening to seize control of the dragon gem, but she also has to deal with the dragon herself and a bunch of other people affected by the Druun. One might wonder if the plot would have been suited better for a three season long TV series to allow for more fleshing out, since all of the effort that was put into the world building feels utterly wasted on a story that would rather get from point A to point B instead of allowing time for the viewers to comprehend what they just saw.Also, if there's one aspect that could easily take someone out of the movie, it's the obnoxious modern slang and relatable lingo used for some of the dialogue. Being an unfortunate common practice in so many family movies nowadays, this problem has become increasingly noticeable in movies set in time periods far behind this type of interaction. It's gotten to the point where nearly everyone beyond the wacky sidekick speaks that kind of tongue, thus leaving no contrast. Not to mention, while the voice cast are generally solid as far as their characters go, especially with Kelly Marie Tran delivering well as the titular character, Awkwafina feels incredibly miscast as the last dragon Sisu. Of course the idea of an ancient creature from mythology sounding different than the usual deep throated gravel is funny in its own right, but anyone who has ever seen the famed comedic internet personality turned actress won't find much to distinguish from her other roles, so she really sticks out like a sore thumb. Once again, trying to get with the times doesn't work in a different time period.So for all of its ambition and intriguing ingredients, Raya and the Last Dragon falls short on its potential with an overly rushed story, underdeveloped character plot lines, obnoxious dialogue and bizarre casting decisions. To anyone who has yet to see this, it wouldn't hurt to give it at least one watch, but there are far better Disney movies to check out other than this. Heck, even by big scaled CG adventure epics, you're probably better off with Frozen and Moana. At least those films knew how to keep their premises clear and concise, while Raya ends up biting off more than it could chew and ended up choking itself in the long run.",Raya and the Last Dragon

78,trinaboice,Stunning to look at but misses the mark on a few other elements,8,13 March 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Disney's newest feature film really feels like an epic adventure in Southeast Asia. It's the first of its kind that features the beauty of Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Laos, and the Philippines. The production team toured many of those areas to get a feel for designing the cultures of this part of the world. The word ""raya"" actually means ""great"" in Indonesia. Is the movie great? In some aspects, yet missing the mark in others.Can you believe that this is Walt Disney Animation Studio's first fantasy film to not be a musical since The Black Cauldron in 1985? It's also the first Disney Princess movie of the 2020s. Jennifer Lee's leadership at Disney Animation Studios seems to offer a more mature perspective. Although he's only credited as co-director of the film, this is the directorial debut of Paul Briggs, who also gets writing credits. This new film introduces us to several other new voices in animation, all welcome.THINGS I LIKED:
Gorgeous animation with rich details, striking colors, and realistic textures you can almost feel with your fingers.
Beautiful cinematography. The landscapes and environments are stunning. The character animation is stellar.
The strong cast includes some wonderful voice talent that has already been part of former Disney productions, as well as a few newbies such as Kelly Marie Tran, Awkwafina, Izaac Wang, Gemma Chan, Daniel Dae Kim, Benedict Won, and even Alan Tudyk. Much, but not all of the cast, is of Asian descent.
I thought it was cute that Raya's adventures introduce us to entertaining characters along her journey. They're not fully fleshed out, but there is something for everyone.
The villain's look reminds me of the beautiful Ruby Rose. I've always liked her look.
There are definitely some magical moments that remind you that you're watching a Disney movie. I always look for and expect that magic in Disney films.
Babies and fuzzy animals...always a good combination.
The fighting style Raya uses with the two sticks is based on the Filipino martial art Kali, also known as Arnis or Escrima. The fight scenes are fairly sophisticated that almost look like live-action sequences.
Lovely musical score by James Newton Howard.
Although the story is completely formulaic, Disney still successfully got me to tear up in the end.
I love it when adventures include traveling through various nations with distinct cultures. The worldbuilding in this film is mesmerizing.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I've seen a surprising number of negative reviews. So many people are complaining that the story is a hot mess, although they agree that the animation is extremely good. What's interesting is that critics are loving the film, yet ""regular"" viewers are less enthusiastic. Could it be audiences are resentful of the hefty $30 price tag ON TOP OF the additional Disney+ subscription fee? We heard audiences complain about that when the live-action remake of Mulan did the same thing.
Lots and lots of exposition. You kind of expect that in the beginning, but it goes on and one throughout the entire film.
The story might be confusing for kids.
Not all of the jokes and gags land. Even some of the characters won't land with audiences.
The character development wasn't as rich as it could have been. I read a review that said Disney is afraid to have villains and I thought that was an interesting comment since the main villain in this story is an ethereal blob.
Predictable. The story is intriguing, yet borrowed from other movies we've already seen.
We really don't see the theme about trust until Act 3. Do we want to teach our children to blindly trust people who have wronged us before?
The design of the dragons doesn't seem to fit with the Southeast Asian style, which has much more elegant, sophisticated, and ancient-looking motifs. These look more like fluffy toys with pastel hair that would sit on store shelves near merchandise from My Little Pony.
Poor men. This is yet another Disney female empowerment that features mostly women.
No fun surprises worth watching during the final credits.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Cartoon fighting
Your kids will be introduced to the concept of credit: getting what you want now with the promise of paying for it later. Use this as an opportunity to talk to your children about wise financial management.
No profanity. Yay!

79,dilipbts,Raya and the last dragon,8,27 May 2021,"This movie is gorgeous to look at. The visuals alone represent a masterful achievement from Disney, it's hard not to concentrate only in the amazing animation that surrounds the movie. The voice acting is also great and the basic premise of the story is incredibly creative. However the movie is far from perfect; it mainly uses the same Disney formula that everyone knows by heart, creating a story that, although creative and well presented, feels repetitive and incredibly predictable. The humor in the movie falls flat at times and it can take the viewer out of the suspension of disbelief bubble that is required from a movie like this. Overall Raya and the last dragon is a proof that the Disney formula can work, however it falls flat in comparison to other films that the studio has done in the past.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Now to restore peace, I must find the Last Dragon.""Lone warrior Raya, is determined to track down the last dragon in order to establish peace after an evil force has destroyed the land of Kumandra. Disney always has that one movie every year where I just don't know how to feel. Raya and the Last Dragon was that one for me. Due to the poor advertising, I totally forgot this was actually a movie. To me, it just looked average and felt more like one to watch when it would be free on Disney+. Me being me, I went to a theater that hardly anyone seems to go to for a discounted price and landed on this. I must say, I'm very impressed. This movie is by no means amazing, but what it accomplishes hits just right. From what I learned, the movie was made mainly over the lockdowns from last year. Knowing that, they did great for those conditions. The animation is impressive as always. It blends traditional Asian styles of art to the typical 3D animation were used to here in the states. Everything looks gorgeous and it's honestly one of Disney's best animated features, right behind Soul and Toy Story 4. Also, the voice acting is really good. Kelly Marie Tran fit well for Raya, but the best choice of casting came down to Awkwafina as Sisu. Sisu is a very comical character and has a lot to offer for story, and to have he greatness that is Awkwafina made the experience just right.The story is something we've seen before. It does become predictable throughout with that typical setup. And sometimes the dialogue feels a little forced so it can be geared toward younger audiences. Not that it needs to be smart and more mature, just that it feels that it could be not so ""dumbed-down"" at times. As a whole, though, the story is engaging where most of that is thrown out of your brain while watching. With the longer runtime than your usual animated movie, there's room for characterization and further exploring themes. The themes are something we all know, but for a younger audience it's good to focus on. James Newton Howard's score amplifies the whole experience. I believe it to be one of his bets scores yet! Overall, Raya and the Last Dragon is a fun movie that is entrancing to look at and listen to. If it's safe and you feel comfortable enough to see this in theaters, I would say it's an entertaining time. Otherwise you can purchase it for $30 on Disney+ which is totally up to you.

The theme of the movie is trust, harmony, and a sense of community, so unique and distinctive qualities can make dramatic effect when they come together as one.Raya and Namaari... strong female characters in Disney, lovely and approachable at the same time. They are so real and dynamic, and so as their relationship, not always good and not always bad just like our relationship with others in real life.

The story is a tried and true format, a person of significance finds themselves responsible for searching for a magical MacGuffin that will save the fantastical world in which they inhabit and pick up some friends along the way. I get a sort of Journey to the West vibe which is a big compliment as it is one of my favourite stories ever written. Kelly Marie Tran, Gemma Chan and Awkwafina are pitch perfect in their roles and another highlight is Benedict Wong as Tong.

IN THE BEGINNING we have this ridiculus plot explained in rapid spitfire speed.All you have to do is take one sip of the coffee and you miss It.

It doesnt give the viewer a chance to be scared or thrilled. Everything is zoomed so fast that I literally walked out of the cinema. That's Disney today. Even though my knowledge and grudge for all the franchises they laid waste, every franchise I ever loved pretty Much,. I still had respect for their animated work. Stupid me... Raya Is not art. Its an animated panic stress inducing mess. Its like watching Indiana jones with a fastforward button pushed In. The momentum, atmosphere, storytelling, the opportunity to get emotionally invested Is absolutely impossible because of the annoying storytelling and obtuse Bullcrap speed of the scenes. There's no room to feel anything of what's going on. It's like Having a bad Marvel movie on and you fall asleep couse of the terrible cgi computer lifeless and dead effects.

Interesting plot and spotless execution! Even if the story is a bit overdone, it managed to come together in a refreshing manner. No wasted scenes and you lose yourself in it if paying attention, making it feel shorter than it is.
Now, if Sisu the dragon wasn't as ""Awkwafina"" at times, this would be close to a perfect animated movie.. but she does balance the dryness of Raya, which is a good thing.It's good to see Disney doing something original that has this quality. This is what they should be spending their budget on, not poorly-remaking Aladdin.",Raya and the Last Dragon
93,DeBBss,It couldn't get any more generic,5,17 June 2021,"I don't know if Raya and the Last Dragon can be any more generic. Usually in films like these, you get something for the kids and something for the adults. But this film offers no value for the poor parents that have to watch this movie for their kid(s).It has a plot that is bland and safe. The plot is neither intelligent nor emotional (at least for me). It also has a huge pacing problem. The film was rushed beyond belief. The characters do one thing, then move on, then do another thing, then move on. For some reason, the film didn't want to spend the time to develop the characters, or give some scenes to show how they feel about the current situation. It reminds me so much of a video game, and if you've ever played a modern video game, you'd understand what I'm saying. They should've at least given an extra 20 minutes of run time, because it was short and it felt short.Since Raya and the Last Dragon did a poor job with giving the characters depth, none of the characters are really going to be that memorable. Take a character like Mike Wazowski; off the bat I remember that he struggles to accept the fact that he wouldn't be a good scarer. I remember that he struggles to get attention because of his uninteresting job. But he's also funny and quick witted, and by the end of the movie, he learns that he can use his previously undesired skills to improve his life. In Raya and the Last Dragon, there are zero characters that are like the Mike Wazowskis. All of them have the same goals for the same reasons, and for some reason, every character in this movie is either super goofy or super serious, and there's barely an in between.The only thing going for this movie are its visuals. The film is incredibly beautiful, and it's one of the best looking animated films I've ever seen. I also like the character designs, and the voice acting was overall pretty solid.Raya and the Last Dragon could've been so much more than what we got. It's one dimensional and bland with some impressive visuals, and that's about it. But, since it's free to watch on Disney+, I don't think it's so bad that it's not worth a try.",Raya and the Last Dragon

If only Disney did more of this. Of course, there were some things I could have done without, such as the baby, but I was entertained from start to finish. If you like Asian-inspired fantasies but only want a single movie make this your priority. Thank you.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Overall rating 73/100Long ago, in the fantasy world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. However, when sinister monsters known as the Druun threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, those same monsters have returned, and its up to a lone warrior called Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) to track down the last dragon and stop the Druun for good.I have to say, Raya and the last dragon was a good film, but for me a disappointment compared to previous films for Disney. I thought the animation was beautiful and creative. I loved the worldbuilding and attention to detail with the different parts of the world. I liked the character background and set up for Raya. There was a lot of likeable characters. The action was great, the chemistry between the characters was really good. There was a good set up for development with Raya that payed off well. I thought it was funny in places, and the connection between certain characters was great. I loved the Asian representation, I thought it was handled and executed incredibly well. The soundtrack was great. I liked the development to the plot and character conflict. As well as the development to the villain, some good themes about putting your trust in others. As well as a fun final act with a satisfying ending.However, it was very corny in places, which is to be expected with family movies but it was overdone slightly. There was a fair amount of on the nose dialogue which bugged me. The dragon voiced by Awkwafina was honestly really annoying most of the time which is a shame because I like her. The movie was too predictable with how it resolved situations, making it way too easy for Raya on multiple occasions. I thought there was pacing issues, and the movie really lost its way in the second act. And for me I was emotionally disconnected and the more emotive parts didn't connect.So overall, Raya and the last dragon is a fun and visually beautiful film. With loveable characters, excellent action and worldbuilding, whilst also having great messages. But is let down by the predictability and episodic structure, its over the top corniness and irritating characters, and never fully recovering from its second act slump. So its an enjoyable film, but for me isn't on par with previous Disney animations.",Raya and the Last Dragon
97,gavinp9,Visually and emotionally superb story,8,6 March 2021,"'Raya & the Last Dragon' is another excellent Disney Animation film (not Pixar), with strong female characters, a well-plotted story and some breathtaking animation. We're introduced to the fantasy world of Kumandra, which is an imitation of Thailand, Cambodia, China, Malaysia, Vietnam, where benevolent dragons once lived in harmony with humans. Raya (Tran; ""rie-a"", not ""ray-a"") is a princess in the now-divided Kumandra, as is Namaari (Chan). To restore peace and Kumandra, Raya sets out to find the last dragon - Sisu (Awkwafina) - and the gem.Awkwafina provides lots of the comedy as Sisu and works really well, as does Raya's armadillo, Tuk Tuk. Along the way, Raya & Sisu are joined and helped by Boun (Wang), Tong (Wong) and some cute monkeys. Needless to say, there's a big showdown with others that are selfishly keeping parts of the gem.The pacing is great, and there's plenty of subtle and not-so-subtle lessons laid in. Some nice character growth for Raya and Namaari. The CGI is exceptional - I don't think kids these days appreciate it how good they have it! What they're able to make happen on-screen is a joy to watch. Totally satisfying experience.",Raya and the Last Dragon

In the battle the dragons sacrifice therselves in a last stand drawing all their power into a single stone. The Last dragon Sisu(Awkwafina) uses its to contain the drun and save the Lands. However Following her disappearance the tribes all turn on each other and everyone tries to possess the last remaining dragon magic. Eventually shattering it resulting in the release of a drun once again. Now we follow Raya(Kelly Marie Tran)princess of the heartland who travels to find Sisu and reseal the stone. The Story really isn't that interesting or compelling It almost seemed as if this was going to be Disney's attempt of how to train your Dragon. Unfortunate to say this movie is nowhere near as well put together as those films. The constant message is the concept of trust and unity thrown throughout the whole movie, but it never grasp that feeling until the very end by that point it's pointless and feels unwarranted. The Drun Aren't even the real threat of the movie it's the people themselves. That the message but that's the problem everybody is a backstabbing liar, never really even trying to have any of these tribes try to communicate with each to give a reason of a doubt why they shouldn't. Raya's father tries in the beginning that goes nowhere. Resulting in a flat cast of characters, who you really don't connect to the slightest. The closest to a character there in this film is Raya. You get why she's pissed off, but even she has her faults I feel as though they really should've put more focus and time into her & Namaari seeing as it seems the real focus. The other supporting characters are flat and boring they really don't serve any purpose in the story other than try to convey the whole unity message each from different lands. A 10 year old name boun from tail, tong A kind hearted warrior from spine, baby con-artist from Talon and Raya antagonist Namaari the warrior princess of fang. Bon, tong and the baby have a few sentences that explain what's happened to them but they really don't go in depth, they're kind of just there for the end. Namaari has somewhat of an interesting subplot where she eventually finds out about Sisu and feels conflicted on the matter but it doesn't Really pace itself and is rather rushed when it starts to come around. Lastly there's Sisu The dragon creatures of renowned wealth, power and wisdom. Sisu's none of these things plenty of fans will love her just just because of Awkwafina, dragons are my personal favorite monsters the title alone and the trailers peaked my interest in the movie. I wanted to like her however the fact the matter is Sisu's annoying, she's gullible, she's naïve, she doesn't contribute much for most of the movie, She not that funny. Being completely oblivious to the fact that humans some are just overall faulty, corrupt and not perfect. It would make sense if she would acknowledge this fact that some are like that, but she just wants to hammer in the message to trust in people. She tried to explain this to Raya the whole movie with exception of one speech. That actually felt somewhat genuine for a dragon she's just making dumb decisions. With all that being said though the movie does still have some spectacle to it of course the animation looks good,a few action scenes that are in this movie are pretty decent kind of makes you wish kind of we got a few more sword fights. The cities and tribes they took inspiration from southeast Asia countries, like Cambodia ,Indonesia and Thailand. It could've been branched out more you could give them more of an identity and get more focus to all these cultures that let's be honest tend to be overlooked mainstream Compared to Chinese and Japanese. I recommend checking out Raya and the last dragon when the price is lowered. It's an average movie with a weak story and support, but it still has beautiful visual , interesting settings with some action.",Raya and the Last Dragon

105,MandalBros-5,a KNOWN STORY but full on ADVENTURE.,8,25 July 2021,"I have never reviewed any animated film before. So, don't know what the points should I include, let's try.The plot of this film is something like Infinity War. There Thanos was looking for Infinity Stones and here Raya is looking for some Gem pieces of dragon.Like most of the Disney animations, this is also fully enjoyable. There's always a cute character in every Disney animation, Tuk Tuk Played that character here. Didn't expect the character Sisu would be so funny.At the end, Disney animated films are not just an usual entertaining film, they always give some beautiful messages, Raya And The Last Dragon is not an exception in this case.Available on Disney+ Hotstar.© MandalBros.",Raya and the Last Dragon
106,chubarova,Awesome,10,16 March 2021,"Nowadays Disney studios made a lit prequels, sequeks, spin-offs and etc. They had a little number of original projects. This animation is brilliant that we as audience can catch in the big sea of similar franchise. Firstly, the plot is great, we can see the new world named Kumantra that was inspired by Southeast Asia culture. The myths looked like from our world: dragons, superpowers and so on. Also the idea of film is great too: love and trust together can solve any problem. Secondly, the animation itself is amazing, me eyes squeaked with delight when I wathed the dragon.
So, it's new outstanding animation from Disney.",Raya and the Last Dragon
107,TheVictoriousV,"Cute, beautiful, and little else",6,11 March 2021,"The latest ""OMG FINALLY"" moment for Walt Disney Studios was supposed to be the fact that, with the release of Raya and the Last Dragon, Southeast Asians can at last ""see themselves"" in the Disney Animated Canon. A lengthy Twitter thread revealed that, on the contrary, many Southeast Asians either don't yet have the Disney+ access to actually do that or just can't afford to cough up the extra 30 to watch Raya. I'm told that in Indonesia, the movie's playing in theaters; notably, this country already has pretty dismal COVID numbers.It's also a bit funny that Disney's latest attempts at portraying Asian cultures (including the one that was filmed near an Uyghur internment camp for that extra Chinese authenticity) seem to have borrowed some stylistic influences from YouTube cooking videos; both this film and Mulan have disposable food-prep sequences that bring to mind the sort of videos that led to my dad suddenly making wok and (admittedly delicious) sushi every weekend. Considering how poorly Chinese culture was reportedly understood in Mulan, browsing orientalist YouTube trends may very well be the extent of Disney's research at this point.Scenes like that might also be for the weebs in the audience, or viewers who fancy themselves cultured for simply appropriating certain East Asian aesthetics, rituals, or whatever else they've learned from snappy online tutorials, and will now praise Disney as inclusive to ""Asian viewers"". It is worth noting that Kumandra is not a real place, but a fictitious hodge-podge of Eastern countries. Quite often, this sort of thing is alarming.That being said, Raya indeed brings attention to specifically Southeast Asian mythologies, and I don't know that there is homophobia and racism in any of those countries that supposedly-woke Disney feel the need to capitulate toward (by keeping their gay romances subtle enough to be easily edited out, shrinking black characters on their MCU posters, and whatever else makes their products more marketable over there). In short, this is hardly among Disney's most offensive or falsely-woke productions.And sure, Raya is certainly good for Asian-actor representation, even if it may seem reductive to cast a Chinese-American like Awkwafina, a Korean-American like Daniel Dae-Kim, and so forth when the focus is purportedly Southeast Asian culture. Leading the cast is Kelly Marie Tran, which is also seen as a triumph after all the bullying she received from Star Wars nerds who felt she was the new Jar-Jar.As a movie, Raya is mainly cute, but it also has some of the darkest interludes of Disney's latest Animated-Canon entries (I almost believed that our heroes would die at the end, which might've been more consistent with how the McGuffins are said to work but whatever). And no matter how good CGI is getting, I will always gasp when things like water and fur look as astonishingly detailed as they do here. The story involves god-like dragons (in many Eastern mythologies, dragons are indeed closer to gods than the wyverns we have over in the West) who bring water, and evil entities that turn things into stone and ash. There's a shot where water falls onto a stone texture that made me go ""Woof"".The plot is a fairly basic fetch quest with some fairly basic critiques on humanity's proclivity for squabble and tribalism. Tran and Awkwafina are very entertaining as Raya and the last dragon, respectively, and the scenes where said dragon attempts to seem human are decently funny. Gemma Chan plays a remarkably three-dimensional antagonist and there are many other enjoyable side characters, including Benedict Wong as a massive softie and Alan Tudyk as some sort of giant pillbug. There's also a turbo baby.Overall, the film is warm and enjoyable. I preferred the character designs of Soul, which also had cooler lighting effects, but this was still a fun, beautiful watch, made even better by a blurb in the end credits that explains how this movie, due to COVID restrictions, was created in 400 different households by persons with extraordinary patience with the directors' ""inability to use the Internet (Dude you're still on mute)"".",Raya and the Last Dragon
108,bpilato-08111,Disney got this one right,7,21 September 2021,"There's a great lesson in this movie about all of us getting along no matter our cultural backgrounds. I like it.

109,jackgdemoss,Animation is becoming so consistently beautiful,7,20 March 2021,"Raya is so visually stunning that I found myself often directing my full attention to the animation details rather than the exposition or action. We are reaching a point in technological advances that every major animated film in the next 10 years is going to be awe-inspiring visually, so I am going to make a conscious effort to give less weight in my rating to that end. As much as this pains me, the alternative is me continuing to give every pixar and disney movie a 8/10 minimum even if the plot is average or just below average. Raya really has nothing special going in the plot and is even a bit boring at times. It is entirely carried by some funny jokes and 2021 animation. This is worth seeing in theatres as a spectacle.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Raya's message is that in order for peace and harmony to exist, it is necessary to put differences aside (it is not new in cinema, but it is still true!) and learn to trust others.I expected more from Raya's character, she didn't reach a certain level to make her a memorable Disney heroine from now on.Awkwafina as Sisu is the star of the show.",Raya and the Last Dragon

I just think the story needed to be fleshed out more. Raya's quest to find each stone felt too easy. Plus I felt the character relationships needed to be worked on as well. Raya and Namarii are set up to be these used to be close but now are ex friends and enemies but in reality they met each other once. Their supposed relationship in the film feels forced. The dad makes *spoiler* a sacrifice play early into the film for no good reason. I get the filmmakers needed to have the moment so it would act as a driving force to band together (because they all suffered loss) but like...literally the way it plays out makes no sense. He could have escaped with Raya.I don't think it was a bad film per se. Overall still enjoyable. It had some great action sequences, there was still a great message. It is Disney afterall so it will tug at your heartstrings. The animation was beautiful as well. And i have no complaints from the cast.

114,nidhunmoviebuff,Disney's first Southeast Asian heroine inspires and entertains!,8,8 June 2021,"Disney's first Southeast Asian heroine dazzles with an animated feature that will make you laugh and pull at your heartstringsKelly Marie Tran is a force of nature as Raya, a fierce warrior princess who must reclaim her kingdom's lost glory against a mysterious demonic plague, a theme that is scaringly apt for these pandemic times.Awkwafina defies all established stereotypes of mystical dragons, portraying 'Sisu' as a bumbling, timid and wise-cracking beast who will leave you in splits.A rag-tag and dysfuctional, but charming team is assembled under the leadership of the plucky Raya, and one can't help but fall in love with these adorable rascals as they unleash fresh hell on their enemies.Directors Don Hall and Carlos Lopez Estrada have gone into painstaking detail to illustrate the vibrant culture of South East Asia, They have paid rich tribute to each region by fashioning the five kingdoms mentioned in the plot, beautifully from the popular landmarks in these countries.The Tail is inspired by the deltas around the Mekong River, the Talon by the floating markets of Thailand, the Spine by the bamboo forests of Vietnam, the Fang by Cambodia's Angkor Wat and the Hearth takes inspiration from the Naga people of Myanmar and Northeast India.Raya and the Last Dragon is a fitting, woke tribute to the rich legacy of Disney movies gone by. A sureshot, engaging and entertaining family watch!Highly recommended!",Raya and the Last Dragon
115,AdrenalinDragon,Paint-by-numbers Dragon Chick Flick,6,6 March 2021,"Raya and the Last Dragon was very underwhelming to what Disney is when it's at top form. There's nothing really outright bad about it per se, but it plays the standard Disney formula safe and ultimately is just an Animated Movie you'll barely remember outside of a couple of scenes. It simply doesn't have that Disney magic the classics had and you wish it aimed for higher levels.Most of the characters aside from Raya and Sisu are so bland that I can't remember their names and don't really get any character development. They're there just as comic relief and backup support. You won't remember the villain or the locations all that much either. Sisu the Dragon is alright in small doses as she gets a few okay lines and gags that are standard Disney fare. I didn't find her too annoying surprisingly and her powers give her some good scenes here and there when given the chance.Raya gets a prologue that sets up her character and the main story of the film. Considering all the scenes and characters it uses, it doesn't really pay off all that well. The antagonists are so painfully obvious that I was kind of hoping something else would happen, but alas some dumb and contrived things happen to make the actual story begin. It becomes very predictable and kind of lazy for a big chunk of the film. To give the writers some credit though near the end it gets a bit better as the themes and emotional moments come together, but for the most part it's just a watchable quest fetch adventure trip.The Animation is as expected very beautiful and smooth. The fight sequences are nicely done and
locations are big and colourful. Voice work is good and the music fits well with the type of film it is. I'm sure it would look and sound great in theatres. The film's pacing is also fast and never feels like it drags, so kids will sit through this without much of a fuss easily.Overall, Raya and the Last Dragon is just there. It's neither good or bad really, it's borderline mediocre-passable. The jokes are a mixed bag, the story is safe and generic for the most part, and it doesn't leave you with a big impression after seeing it. If I wanted to rewatch a story with a Girl and Dragon in it, I'd watch the original Mulan from Disney.5.5/10",Raya and the Last Dragon

118,sirwillisiv,A gripping adventure that leaves me wanting more...,7,7 March 2021,"I went into Raya and the Last Dragon not expecting a whole lot. Lately Disney Animation hasn't left a strong impression on me, but Raya turned out to be quite a gripping and picturesque adventure. It gave me some serious Avatar: The Last Airbender vibes with its rich and imaginative mythology and swift martial arts action. It's clear as crystal that a lot of thought and passion was put into this film's worldbuilding, but where it gets complicated - for me, at least - is the story. I found the character's journey to be emotionally investing; teaching familiar but necessary lessons about trust. However, I didn't think it was entirely fulfilling. Squeezing such an epic narrative into a runtime under two hours is a tricky deal and it leaves me wondering a lot more about the characters and the world around them.I hope Raya gets expanded into a television series down the road. In fact - in the mold of Avatar - that's probably what it should've been from square one because it throws quite a lot at you in a short timeframe. With an episodic format, it would've allowed the story and mythos to sink in at a smoother pace. As for nitpicks, I feel the comedy could've used a stronger punch, and yeah, I can't unsee Elsa in that dragon's face. Despite these criticisms, I admire Raya a lot for not falling for the typical Disney checklist of recent by having exclusively Mary Sues, pretty visuals and unfocused morals. It tells an engaging fantasy with spiritual depth and the world is sure to enrapture you. It's far more than what Frozen II and Ralph Breaks the Internet had to say. Raya may not work as a complete whole but I think it could be the start of something grander in scale.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The colours and details put into the textures and subtle movements by the characters is just amazing.Raya was a well developed character with multiple layers that are shown throughout. For all intents and purposes she is Disney's version of 'Tomb Raider'. Sisu was a little too goofy for my liking, especially when the character is first introduced, but she gets better as the film goes on. Awkwafina has this raspy smoker's voice that is weird to picture belonging to a dragon Deity.The overall message of the movie is trust and the power therein.

124,arabnikita,Exactly what I expect from Disney animations,8,14 March 2021,"Since the acquisition of Pixar, Disney have seemingly lost their touch when it comes to their animation but here they finally got back on track. I was looking forward to Raya and The Last Dragon since the moment I saw the trailer and it did not disappoint. This was exactly what I expect from a Disney animated film. A simple story with likeable characters, beautiful visuals and just enough innocence for me to relax and get lost in the magic without overthinking every little detail.The story was clearly inspired by Avatar: The Last Airbender and that is something that will get a lot of positive points from me. While I definitely expected Raya to be a likeable protagonist, what took me by surprise was the Dragon voiced by Awkwafina. From the facial expressions and body language to the snappy dialogue, she was the unexpected highlight of the film. The other side characters provided plenty of comedic relief that fit in well into the overall theme.One major letdown for me was the absence of a good soundtrack which felt extremely ""Un-Disney-like"". Music serves as the heart of animation by creating emotional moments that fill the film with a soul and the mediocrity of the soundtrack could be felt throughout the experience. While the story is somewhat formulaic and childish, it is important to remember that this is a kids film which should be watched with an adequate attitude. Taking this into account, I would still definitely recommend Raya and the Last Dragon for it's charming visuals and charismatic characters who fill the film with delightful joy.Movies.shmovies on Instagram",Raya and the Last Dragon

We are all villains in this broken world.",Raya and the Last Dragon
126,MovieBuff11732,One Of The Best Looking Animated Films Out There,8,17 March 2021,"This was another movie that was delayed from the 2020 movie season because of COVID-19. It then got the death sentences of going on Disney Plus for thirty dollars.Raya And The Last Dragon is about a city called the Heart and its people wanting to invite all of the other cities over to reunite. The Heart also cary a stone that saved the world from a virus that sweeps through people turning them into stone. One of the cities gets there hand on the stone and lets the virus back out. Years later, a girl named Raya is trying to collect all of the stones to bring everybody back together and get rid of the virus.Raya And The Last Dragon was a good movie. I thought I would be calling it much more then that after I saw it. I even went to go see it in the theaters because I heard it looked amazing. And it did. The water and many colors displayed throughout the film looks like something out of a painting by Van Gogh. The problem was the story. They created this amazing world and amazing back story just to end with everybody holding hands a singing Kumbya. Not literally but it felt like they were about to break out singing. I came in expecting more of a life is tough ending and we have to work through it but instead it was just everybody should work together and nobody should dislike anybody. It was sort of disappointing. I don't know what happened with Disney stories. They used to make deep ones like the Lion King and Mulan but then just switched to making stories like this for some reason. I don't get it. It was just disappointing. They even shoved the dragon off to the side. The dragon was just used to make the message more effective, but instead for the whole movie I didn't like that dragon.The acting was on par with all of the other Disney animated movies. There was nothing bizarre. Kelly Marie Tran did pretty good as Raya and Awkwafina did a good job as the dragon. Although the dialogue was a little weird too. They would use dialogue that we would use in this world. Like the slang we use and analogy's that would only pertain to us. It made you understand the film better but the world didn't feel as much like its own because of this. It was just a weird choice I didn't get.As I was saying earlier, the animation is beautiful. Many times I was just mesmerized by how nice either the villages looked or the water going up stairs backwards. The world was also magnificently crafted. They had five different cities or clans that all did their own sort of thing. We did get a glimpse at each of them but we didn't really see much of them. That is why I think this movie would make a great video game. It could even take place during the time the first plague broke out. I just think it is a cool idea.The action isn't a key part of the film but I looked really good. This film created many different weapons for the combat and it just looked like dancing. If a fight scene is perfect, that is how it should look.Raya And The Last Dragon was an animation that had an amazing world and backstory built up around it but then didn't really deliver in the end. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes watching animated Disney films or if they just want to see a good film.",Raya and the Last Dragon
127,BabelAlexandria,"Pan Southeast Asian Epic, Starring a New Disney Warrior-Princess",9,7 November 2021,"This is very much a standard Disney Princess movie for our time: not only is Raya self-assertive, a-la-Rapunzel in Tangled, and resisting traditional societal expectations for girls, a-la-Mulan, or Merida in Brave (or even Elsa in Frozen); she seems not to need such resistance at all, but simply walks into a warrior role, leading an action-adventure, a-la-Moana, that, 30 years ago, would normally have been conducted by a boy/man. Raya's main enemy is another warrior-princess and her mother; there is no love interest (a-la-Elsa and Moana), but a strong relationship with her father, which she attempts to restore by turning him back from stone.Another interesting aspect of this movie is its marketing as Southeast Asian. From what I can tell by reading articles about it, the mythology is not strongly tied to a particular Southeast Asian country, language/tradition, or myth, but draws on many, as is also reflected in the creative team and voice actors. That is very similar to the pan-South American approach found in another animated project released this year, Maya and the Three. And both are very much like Game of Thrones, which draws on a vaguely European mythology, without being closely beholden to any particular aspect of it. And that, I think, is as it should be, even if more faithful representations of myths and traditions should have their place in entertainment too.",Raya and the Last Dragon

130,hoernkeem,"Raya and the Last Dragon (2021, Don Hall & Carlos Lopez Estrada) Stupendous animation combined with a solid Asian based fantasy makes for a high quality adventure for all ages",8,28 August 2021,"From Disney animation studios comes this fantasy fable based on Southeast Asian cultures. It has a who's who of Hollywood Asian voice talent including Kelly Marie Tran as Raya and Akwafina as the titular last dragon. This film got a simultaneous release at theaters as well as on Disney+ Premiere Access due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film has lush animation. It is probably the best I have seen outside of Pixar and may transcend more than a few of those as well. This is an interesting, engaging and family friendly story that can be easily enjoyed by viewers of any age.Long ago the land of Kumandra was beset upon by evil spirits that turned people to stone. The magical dragons came together and Sisu the dragon and her kin concentrated the dragons' magic into a single gem that banished the evil Druun spirits. The land split into factions though all wanting to possess the dragon gem for their own tribes protection and gain. Our protagonist, Raya, is the daughter of the Chief of the Heart Tribe entrusted to keep the Dragon gem safe. Chief Benja trains his daughter in the way of protecting the gem. The chief firmly believes the land can be reunited, but at a peace dinner he and his daughter are betrayed and the other tribes attempt to steal the gem. Ultimately the gem is broken into several pieces and as each tribe scuttles away with a section the Druun are released and once again bring chaos to the land petrifying everything they come into contact with. Raya is saved, but her father is turned to stone. Raya goes on a quest to find Sisu the legendary last dragon and collect the Dragon gem shards and restore the land as her father wanted. Along the way she collects a motley crew to aid her in her quest. She is initially powered by sadness, fear and vengeance but along the way learns the importance of forgiveness, trust, love and faith. It may sound overly sappy, but it truly comes together in an organic, if somewhat predicable, way.This is a very well executed, beautiful film. The animation is truly extraordinary especially in the choreographed fight sequences. The music by James Newton Howard is worth noting. The story features very well defined and strong female characters that are neither subservient or beholden to men. The overall plot reinforces some fundamental humanist values as well such as camaraderie, forgiveness and the value of working together toward a common goal in contrast to selfishness. The voice cast all do great jobs. In some respects this may hew a bit too close to a standard Disney princess template, but I thought the production did enough to distinguish itself and travel its own unique path.Eric's Grade: B+",Raya and the Last Dragon

I love burgers but this just doesnt work with movies and thats the problem here.Skip this. If you want the same exact story in a recent cartoon, watch Trolls 2. Its just as bad in terms of story and characters but at least they entertain with music. There is literally nothing entertaining in this movie. Not for anyone over 5 at least.",Raya and the Last Dragon

135,chandean-69762,Raya and the Last Dragon 2021 Review,8,7 March 2021,"This gave me major Moana and Avatar The Last Airbender vibes. Disney's animation has become amazing. This truly has to be some of the best animation that Disney's done, everything looks extraordinarily crisp and detailed, and when it comes to things like water it almost looks photorealistic. Voice acting is also pretty great. Kelly Marie Tran and Awkwafina are amazing leads and they both surprised me with how well they did voice acting wise. I also have to give credit to Benedict Wong who seemed like he was very into his character and I loved every second his character was on screen. The story, although pretty cliché when it comes to Disney films, does have little twists that make the experience pretty unique and memorable. This will without a doubt be one of Disney's best works and a lot of peoples favorite. It even has one hell of a score and i'm glad they didn't make this a musical (I personally despise most musicals). This is one of those movies I really wish I was able to see in theatres ... maybe some day.",Raya and the Last Dragon
136,Oktay_Tuna,Raya and the Last Dragon is a Missed Opportunity,4,23 March 2021,"When the film started, I was very hopeful because at first I thought that our protagonist(who is mostly a stereotypical Disney princess in these animations) was someone who was trained to steal the gem but I was wrong. The film quickly changed our perspective on the character and made her such a generic character. She is smart, strong, rich is a princess and she has a father who loves her. If you know the formula, then you probably guessed that she was going to lose her father. Then we come to our villain who is destined to turn good, I mean it is obvious. Disney can't make a girl who is a child at the start a complete villain and I am fine with that. But just imagine, imagine if she was our protagonist. Then the film would have been fresh and intriguing. She has bad influence from her mother and she believes that her mother is right. Imagine how powerful the scene where she sees Sisu would be. Then an inner conflict would start: ""Am I really on the right side?"" You probably know where I am going. The scene where Raya gives her the gem, that would be such an emotional scene. But in this version our protagonist has no inner conflict to resolve. Yes, she is enraged at Namaari but I mean who wouldn't be. The side characters and Susi are generic and add nothing to the plot other than entertaining children. I know that these characters have to be in a Disney animation, and I have no problem with that but at least take a risk Disney. I didn't hate the film though and the only reason for that is in technicals. The animation is gorgeous, especially the usage of vibrant colors is astonishing. I don't remember a Disney film which is this colorful. The music is well integrated and the usage of light is also very good. Yes, the children will have a fun time but this won't affect them like Pixar films did. It does nothing different.",Raya and the Last Dragon
137,therealjaysmoke,So predictable and uninteresting,3,14 August 2021,"From the moment the dragon started talking, everything just went southwards. The design of the dragons in itself was the worst of the entire movie. The dialogue were long, uninteresting and not funny at all, I had to skip ahead several times. And you know it's a kids movie when the worst that can happen to you is you turn to stone. Great animation and all but everything else fell flat. I'll watch something else if I have to watch something with the kids. Definitely not putting myself through this twice.",Raya and the Last Dragon
138,terrylarosa,Spectacular movie almost ruined by voice actor,8,7 June 2021,Beautiful animation with good pacing and story was almost ruined ( once again ) by Akwafina's grating voice and manner of speech. Her rap talk is awful and like nails on a chalkboard. How anyone can find this pleasing or approved it boggles the imagination and somebody apparently does because she talks like these in almost every movie she's in. Her voice is nauseating as others pointed out. Otherwise the movies a winner. Be warned.,Raya and the Last Dragon
139,jordyntsmith,Beginning of a New Disney Age?,6,7 June 2021,"The movie is a visual masterpiece and features incredible cinematography! But my praise stops there.The characters are too one dimensional. The action feels geared to young adults, but the dialogue is toned down to a child-like level. The world building is decent, but doesn't feel complete. It is a weaker movie for Disney, and may possibly mark a decline into another dark age.",Raya and the Last Dragon
140,pritol,Sensational but easy watching...,8,19 June 2021,"The animation quality in this movie is absolutely breathtaking, the best that I've seen yet! The core plot line is rather typical and predictable with the usual Disney feel good vibe in there, however that does not in any way damage the enjoyment in watching!It's great to see Disney stretching further afield culturally once again. With both Moana, and Raya And The Last Dragon being a long way from your standard Disney Princess stereotype.The main criticism is actually that the main antagonist Namaari just isn't likeable on any level, nor does she ever fully explain her anger towards Raya...you just don't feel any sympathy towards her. Which unfortunately is poor writing to be honest. (But that's my only real complaint).The contemporary themes around greed, misplaced nationalism, and the environment are quite prominent...but they're not in your face on any level. The film asks us to remember we are all one big family and to out trust in people to get the best out of them....wonderful asks and a great message for the next generation.But all in all this is an absolutely gorgeous looking animated movie which is incredibly easy to watch, with genuinely funny moments breaking up some of the sentimental ones... definitely one to watch as a family!",Raya and the Last Dragon
141,troy-daniel-bush,I haven't been this disappointed in a while.,4,25 June 2021,"I can't emphasize this enough: I was REALLY excited for this movie! I waited months for it to come out, I avoided spoilers, and I only watched one trailer. When I saw that trailer I was like, ""An animated movie that is set in this other world during a Samurai-ish time period and has a badass chick as a protagonist and a badass chick as an antagonist? And it's topped off with a score by James Newton Howard, which sounded pretty awesome from the trailer? This is right down my alley!"" Needless to say I am very disappointed.First I'm going to talk about the good things because there are only so many to address:The animation is great.There's some nice scenery.I like Sisu's design.I like the designs for each kingdom and their members.There's some good voice acting from Kelly Marie Tran. (I like to think this is Disney way of saying, ""That's right. She's not going anywhere."" And, a bit off topic, I actually liked Rose, for the most part, and Tran's performance. She's a good actress so I'm glad she's sticking around. Plus, I think she's cute. I'm a guy, get over it.)And Tuk Tuk was cute enough. Alan Tudyk is an underrated actor!That's about it for the positives.Personal preferences first:I wish the movie wasn't a fetch quest. I don't know what the story should be but I don't think it should be that. That kind of stuff doesn't interest me, at least not anymore.I would have liked it if there were more scenes between Raya and Namaari to build up their rivalry and then that could build to an emotionally satisfying conclusion. Or maybe a depressing one?Now for the real criticisms:The dialogue is bad, even cringe at points. It's either unnecessary, too modern, lame, unfunny, or it takes the form of some very heavy-handed exposition.With the exception of Raya and Namaari, I didn't really find the characters all that compelling.None of the jokes land.There's too much exposition!The sequence of events was predictable.This is the first time where I was left underwhelmed by a James Newton Howard score.Only two of the four kingdoms got any kind of exploration.Sisu was ANNOYING!!!! I like Awkwafina enough. I like her raspy voice, she has some talent, (and I also think she's attractive) but Sisu wasn't funny in the slightest and she never shut up!",Raya and the Last Dragon
142,yongkang-27205,Great southeast Asian representation,7,30 October 2021,"Through the film, there were many nods to the various aspects of southeast Asian culture such as mythical dragons, the names(Tuk Tuk, for example), pangolin, rice paddy fields etc. This all help to culminate in a unique film, a far fetch from the typical fairy tales from the likes of Disney. And it was a good one at that. Like many of the Disney films, this one focuses on the moral of the story: Trust. With lovable characters, and a decent storyline, what more can you ask for?",Raya and the Last Dragon

We need to trust each other and that what matters the most. I recommend you bring lots of tissues while watching. Disney loves to put you in to tears. It is a true emotional journey to experience. I love Raya and the Last Dragon. It is a great classic to collect for great movies like this.,Raya and the Last Dragon
144,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,"Great film promoting peace, prosperity and solidarity in the International Community.",10,4 October 2021,"Great film promoting peace and harmony, and the message that world peace can only be manifested if we trust one another. And treat each other fairly - on an emotional level, as well as an economic and financial level.This message is very much applicable in today's world, I think - as today more than ever we have to understand that International Human Solidarity is much more important than ruthless exploitation and cutthroat capitalism.As indicated by the revelations of the Pandora papers, if unchecked, inequalities between rich and poor states will increase as poverty rises in developing countries. This in turn will lead to a flood of economic migration from the poor to the rich states - a brain drain - causing further economic and social instability across the globe, and threatening to destroy the social fabric of our world.So there is a definite parallel there, between the economic situation in our world, and the picture portrayed in this film - with the sinister monsters known as the Druun, threatening the land, being very much comparable to the corrupt monsters in our world - such as billionaires, world leaders, public officials, military generals - as well as celebrities, rock stars and business leaders, who live in a shadow financial world of their own, plundering the wealth of the people; and being responsible for resource-theft; causing devaluation and leading to thousands of poverty-related deaths. So the corrupt ruling elites of our world, are basically turning everything they touch into stone, just as the Druun in the world of Kumandra.So as indicated in this fine film - where Raya and the Dragon Sisu heal the world - we need to expose the ill-gotten wealth of elites, accumulated through tax evasion and corruption and laundered out to financial ""havens"". The UN SG's Panel FACTI calculated a staggering $7 trillion in stolen assets parked in largely offshore tax havens - that enables some of the world's richest people to hide their wealth and in some cases pay little or no tax.Ruling elites in developing countries and failed states are doing the same. Unfortunately, hardly any world leaders and politicians are interested in preventing this large-scale plunder, nor in repatriating this looted money - since most of them are also part of this scam of resource-theft in our world. Therefore we call on the international community to treat this grave injustice as similar to the climate change crisis; which can only be counteracted effectively by the implementation of a Basic Income Guarantee (BIG).Hence it is imperative that the International Community - in particular lawmakers and world leaders - make a greater effort to implement a Basic Income Guarantee (BIG); so that inequality, poverty and resource-theft can be counter-acted and prevented - and decency and goodness can prevail in the world :)As indicated in this fine picture, the importance of belonging to humankind takes precedence over all the marks of distinction that may separate one person from another.The thing that matters most is not that we have any particular cultural or national identity, or that we abide by any particular religious or philosophical conviction, but that we share with all humanity the highest values of the human race: love, understanding and compassion - which means to extend ones trust and good will not only to one's political allies and family, but rather to treat each and every citizen in our global community as if he or she was your own family and friend :)",Raya and the Last Dragon

148,stermix501,This is the problem of our society...,10,6 March 2021,"...we have been growing in such different backgrounds and based on past masterpieces became so picky at anything slightly new that we cannot even appreciate a family anime. All these reviewers became such expert football managers from their tv sets, that they search any minor issue that is not exactly what they would or wouldn't expect. They expected the bad character to die, he didn't, so they see flatness. They didn't expect such good animation, they preferred something less good, so they see flatness.I have an open mind, I have seen great Chinese animes like Ne Zha or Legend of Deification that I didn't fully understand, where the ethical expectancy of a westerner is not taken into account, I have seen all Disney vintage fairy tale animes and all recent live action versions and at 46 I never remember any that hasn't been up to my satisfaction.

153,nakrugt,"Writers wanted to try something new, then Disney happened, I think.",6,7 March 2021,"The visuals, as pointed out by almost everyone, are amazing. Voice talents are great.I think, the writers wanted to try something new, but then the Disney policies intervened. Let me explain:Raya starts quite interesting actually. And then the time jump to 6 years. The team gathering points. And the finale, I think were somehow what the writers initially planned. Everything else is, though, too generic.Disney seems to try to copy/repeat every plot device they could remember.
Raya is basically Rey (from the Star Wars sequels) with the potential of Anakin in the desert. Her story takes off like Simba (from the Lion King)
Tuk tuk is basically R2D2 with transportation capabilities.Sisu is a combination of Mushu (from Mulan) and another failed attempt to imitate Genie (from Aladdin). And, I think, they might have planned to turn Sisu into different characters as Boun and Tong.(Perhaps, they had planned some kind of reincarnation for the dragons. Because no other dragons utter a single word at the end of the film.)""Unity in diversity"" might have been planned to occupy the central identity of the film. However, the introduction of each character (during the rising action of the plot) falls short. Therefore, the motivations of the characters are as vague as their personal traits.Boun is basically an attempted kid version of Han Solo, and Tong is, of course, a combination of the villains of Mulan and Chewbacca from Star Wars again.
They tried to avoid the archetype of old wise man (one of the standard Joseph Campbell elements), which resulted in characters wandering around aimlessly between the gem pieces.Animal sidekicks run in the background as usual. Comic elements, however, are not funny. Or maybe I am too grown-up to find them funny.(If I can think of other similarities, I will edit this entry in the future)Addition 1: The gem scene at the end is extremely similar to the infinity stone scene at the end of Guardians of the Galaxy.Over all, great visuals. I cannot even imagine how long it took to render the film.",Raya and the Last Dragon
154,stefstars,"Despite The Flaws, It's Good",6,9 March 2021,"I was afraid that this was going to be another 'Frozen' or 'Moana' but it's a story of it's own, which was a happy surprise. It continues on the trend of the previously mentioned films where the protagonist princess is not running after a prince but on a self discovery journey. This film focuses on the subject of friendship and they made a nice story for it. The friendship is dampened by a bad betrayal that comes with a heavy price and from there begins Raya's quest. We see that Raya's been on that journey for quite some time as she's a teenager when she returns on the screen and finds Awkwafina, The Last Dragon. More characters are met along the way but the film doesn't really give you the chance to get attached to them because I don't think the film could keep up with all the characters that were introduced. When they all get turned to stone at the end, they want to get an emotional reaction from you but you don't really feel anything cos these characters weren't explored that well, they only tell their story for like 2 minutes in the film. As for the last dragon's death, that was another one where I wasn't that affected because it happened so quick that instead I was left wondering if she was dead or not. The only ""death"" that hit me was Raya's father because the movie takes time to show you their relationship and how he's a man of peace, so his loss means something.The movie has a lot of action scenes which is a hit with little boys. My 8 year old cousin can't stand Disney Princess movies but he was entertained with this one because of the action sequences. However, one of my biggest pet peeves with this film is the dialogue. This is an issue I've had with a lot of the recent animated Disney movies. I guess Disney is hiring every ""quirky"" individual they can find on tumblr. I know all the Disney princesses are supposed to be relatable to their respectable generations in some way but I feel like the Disney renaissance princesses, hell even Rapunzel, were not as annoying in the way they speak. A lot of the characters in the film, including Raya deliver some cringe lines. For example when Raya's frienemy asks her why she's taking the gem pieces, Raya's response is somthing along the lines of ""what can I say ? I love my bling bling"" ........ yeah. The only Disney characters these type of contemporary lines worked with were The Genie and Mushu because they were played by comedians who had the right timing, people who were/are actually funny. Disney needs new writers on their staff, people who are focused on the story and are actually funny and not ""tumblr awkward, so quirky, lol.""Raya's journey is to restore the gem so Awkwafina can restore the world to the way it was; Dark forces contained and everyone's free from their statue prisons. However, the film later decides that this journey is also to work on Raya's trust issues, which developed after her friend's betrayal when they were kids. There's no way we would have known this had Awkwafina not mentioned it to Raya and that's the only way that topic is ever brought up because they talk about it, not because Raya is actually showing us that's part of what she's working on. Raya solving her trust issues and forgiving her friend is what ultimately saves their world, so for something with that much power to be so poorly presented throughout the film just further shows how poorly written this film is. You would think the only friendship that mattered was the one Raya was developing with Awkwafina since the movie is mostly focused on that than anything else, hence the title, but guess not.On a more positive note, the animation in this film is gorgeous. The water streams impressed me the most, they look so realistic but at the same time so fantasy like so that you remember you're watching an animated film. The settings they made were so beautifully rendered. The film is definitely visually pleasing, it really makes the South East Asian aesthetic pop. Awkwafina's dragon's design though, it looked too much like Frozen's Elsa as a dragon which just gave me more Frozen flashbacks and fatigue.Overall the film isn't so bad. It has a lot of flaws but if you can hang tight and look past them, it's enjoyable. An effort was made and that counts for something. It's not worth the extra $30, so I'd recommend you wait until it's available with the rest of the Disney+ catalog. But I have to ask, who is making these decisions ? A much better film like Soul was free, but they charge extra for this ?",Raya and the Last Dragon

When a threat in the form of creatures known as Druun arrives and threatens to destroy everything; the Dragons combine their power to defeat them but in doing so all but one of the Dragons remains.In the new Disney animated film ""Raya and the Last Dragon""; audiences are introduced to the narrative of the story by Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), who tells that the world has become fractured and she is to blame. A sacred relic that the Dragons used to Defeat the Druun has given her kingdom prosperity but the surrounding kingdoms all named after various parts of a Dragon are envious of their position.When Raya's father Chief Benja (Daniel Dae Kim); attempts to unite the other kingdoms, a tragic betrayal results in the relic becoming fractured with each kingdom taking a fragment. As if this situation was not bad enough; the fracturing of the relic ushers in the return of the Druun and they quickly resume turning everything not protected by a barrier of water to stone.The story then jumps years into the future where Raya and her faithful companion Tuk Tuk (Alan TudyK) are searching the rivers of the kingdoms in an effort to find the location where the last Dragon Sisu (Awkwafina) is rumored to have been sleeping for 500 years.Raya is eventually able to locate Sisu who is a very playful and animated creature and the two set off to save the day by obtaining the missing fragments through any means necessary. Naturally, their journey will be filled with dangers, adventure, and humor, as the various kingdoms have their own unique visual style and characters; some of whom join with Raya on her quest to provide much-needed support, perspective, and at times; humor.The movie is visually amazing as the artists clearly were inspired to create a world that combines elements of many Asian cultures yet has its own unique traits. I marveled at the details of the water and ripples and how the railings on a boat showed uneven discoloration and wear in just a casual scene where the characters talked. It is this attention to detail that really adds to the magic of the film as well as the immersion into fantasy.The supporting cast was great and there are some characters I do not wish to spoil who practically steals every scene in which they are in. My wife and I were captivated from the very start as Disney has created a film that embodies much of their classic themes and yet expands upon them to create a film the entire family will enjoy.The movie will be released in cinemas and via a paid option for Disney+ subscribers. We attended a press screening at a cinema; our first in almost a year and found the setup to be very safe and it was amazing to see such visual splendor on a big screen.Disney has once again created a new classic and has given audiences the magic that they are known for at a time when it is most needed.4 stars out of 5.",Raya and the Last Dragon

158,sjarja,I liked it,8,14 March 2021,"For one .. this is not just a re-imagining of a past Disney feature film .. so hurray for that; but - that does not mean it is an original story. In fact .. the story is a rather common 101 of ""coming together to overcome the odds"" plot that has been done countless times. (and also better than that..)However .. there is nice animation (expected) - and vibrant colours, a more exotic setting (which will most certainly satisfy the large Chinese audience - at which the movie seems to be aimed at the most - not in a bad way .. Frozen was mostly aimed at a cultural audience in the west) .... and most of all . it is a family film. It is mostly uncomplicated (not simple though) .. so children can understand it, along with the moral dilemma and the questions asked (as well as the answers given) .. and adults can enjoy it for pretty much the same reasons.The humor is ... alright. I would sum it up as ""fish out of water"" and ""funny faces"" humor .. nothing witty or really smart there .. but funny for young and old alike.The moral of the movie is a good one, a very optimistic one... however .. aside from the protagonist, most of the other characters are very one dimensional, very flat .. and they do not at all show ""character development"". (again, aside from the protagonists (the two))But why 8/10 still? .. because i enjoyed my time with it .. i do not think i will watch it again .. and it certainly plays in a different league than really good movies (my taste is more D. Lynch movies) .. for an evening with the family .. it is perfect though - and that is what the movie is made for.

159,valen060,Disney's Raya Is Culturally Inviting with Enthralling Fight Sequences and Heart,9,9 March 2021,"One can say Disney has outdone themselves, but that'd be repetitive. Their latest animated flick Raya and the Last Dragon is different from the usual animated feature they usually produce. The film distances itself away from the musical genre the studio is used to, but the action-adventure flair it unleashes is something that had me intrigued and convinced on where this would go. The themes of deceit and mistrust with the consequences of greed helped keep the story going. With a cultural setting that's greatly inspired by Southeast Asian countries, it's unique for them by exploring other parts of the world that's never been written before in past Disney films.Long ago, nations in the land of Kumandra had humans and dragons living together in peace. But all of that changed when the Druun attacked. Enter Raya. To restore peace, this princess and daughter of a chief leads a group of misfits, who must find any remaining dragons out there. And they do in one called Sisu. But there's more to her presence than meets the eye.I consider this film to be an interesting blend:Moana + Avatar: The Last Airbender + Legend of Korra = RayaIn terms of a ragtag band of individuals from different factions with a similar goal? I see the resemblance. However, this entire movie is not without its emotional tone as well and it had me understand what it was trying to convey. Through all the hardships these characters have faced, it's pretty understandable on why they go on this noble quest.With Kelly Marie Tran as the leading heroine Raya herself, she gave quite a performance. But the scene-stealer of it all goes to the shape-shifting dragon Sisu voiced by the humorous Awkwafina. Her design is very majestic and at times enigmatic as we don't know much about what her species had gone through for centuries. With her witty, whimsical personality, she gives off comedic vibes done before in the likes of Robin Williams' Genie from Aladdin (both are blue as well), Eddie Murphy's Mushu of Mulan, and even Dwayne Johnson's Maui of Moana. I can tell in her line delivery that it is pretty much ad-libbing, meta humor but done in her own way as these talented greats have done. I especially liked the action sequences overseen by fight consultant and co-writer Qui Nguyen. One example? The use of Philippine-style martial arts known as Kali (or Arnis) is well choreographed by the animators who brought it to life onscreen. It fills me with glee that my family's heritage is referenced in of all places a Disney movie. Also, 'Crazy Rich Asians' writer Adele Lim is reunited with stars Awkwafina and Gemma Chan to help put together this story. Having been bombarded with both action and wit, I was pleased with how it all played out.Raya's mistrust and vengeance distracted her from her main goal, but with the help of her friends and allies, they were all willing to make a sacrifice for a noble cause. I applaud them all.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Pretty much an overrated movie and might be one the worst Disney films ever. Also Raya is now on of the most boring Disney princesses that I have ever seen. Even The Last Dragon itself was kinda stupid. Don't recommend.,Raya and the Last Dragon
161,christophershobris,Frozen + Mulan = Raya and the Last Dragon,8,7 March 2021,"Although what I said above is true, it's not a knock off of this film at all. I quite enjoyed this film, not exactly what I was expecting but still followed the same wonderful character relationships and magical moments Disney has always been known for. Yes, this film does borrow many elements from both Frozen and especially Mulan, but it's done cleverly. The story isn't that original either, but what makes up for it is the direction they take with the storyline to make it engaging and ultimately interesting. The relationship between Raya and Sisu is developed quite nicely, by not rushing any scenes involving them together, and making both's dilemmas relatable. The directors, writers, and animators did a good job of not making Sisu an annoying cartoon character, instead found the balance to make her goofily charming, and at other times appealingly beautiful at others. Raya on her own is pretty special too. She had her funny moments, but her fearlessness and determination made me attach to her as a character. Both Awkwafina and Kelly Marie Tran do amazing jobs voicing their respective characters, especially Tran, who I felt delivered a powerful performance that I felt it through the screen. The animation is gorgeous, right down to the grass blades. James Newton Howard also does a fine job with the music, nothing as gratifying as something like How to Train Your Dragon, but still serviceable. And that's another thing I like when it comes to Sisu and a dragon herself. They did a good job making sure she was completely different in every aspect from her design, her color, pretty much everything is different from any other dragon in films. Although when she's a human, I'm not as engaged with her as when she is a dragon however. That is where I lead into the negatives, and there isn't much, but I must address them. Any other character that isn't Raya or Sisu I feel are forgettable. I cannot remember any of their names to save my life. And then there are the characters that only serve as merchandising opportunities, nothing more. This would include the pill bug, the monkey-looking things, the other thing I can't remember. The point is, there are a lot of forgettable characters. There really isn't much else outside of that for me. This is by far the best film I've seen by Disney, not Pixar since Zootopia in 2016. Definitely worth checking out! (8.2/10)",Raya and the Last Dragon

164,HanShotFirstGR,"Totally beautiful, great storylines but predictable, recommended for everyone!",8,19 March 2021,"Plot:In a realm known as Kumandra, a re-imagined Earth inhabited by an ancient civilization, a warrior named Raya is determined to find the last dragon.Analysis:It seems like Disney has found the formula to approach not only today's children, but also teens and adults, by giving them valuable lessons through the stories it chooses. Raya And The Last Dragon is a self-aware adventure with interesting ideas, acceptable humour and an amazing world to explore.The first thing that will catch your attention is how stunningly beautiful this is. 3D animated movies have never been this pretty except maybe when Moana came out, this film is not just gorgeous to look at, but also feels extremely real. There are moments you would swear you can feel this as real as a live-action film, the movement, the space design, the detailed artwork, the powerful colours, everything was absolutely brilliant making this such an eye-candy that will probably steal your heart from the very first scenes.But besides that, this is also a pretty mature story, you might think Disney would come out with a basic feel-good story just to have something for little kids to cheer but that isn't the case here. Through brilliant world building and a main plot with an important message, this movie wins the hearts of the audience and although it's far from Disney's best, it's heartwarming and makes you feel more optimistic and motivated. Step by step, minute by minute this one becomes more and more mature, more and more personal, more and more interesting and more and more important.The main theme of the movie is how distrust and constant fighting will never end in a good life. Trust issues is a major problem of the modern society, as the world becomes darker and darker it seems like most of the people are trying to harm you, it gets difficult to believe someone means well, to believe that people change, to give someone a chance despite your fear, but only through those actions of trust you will be really free. It's an idea that was included perfectly in a story about uniting people and stop the cycle of hatred, while it was also applied in personal relationships and interractions, giving the little kids in the audience a more clear and personal way to relate to the meaning of the overall story. It's a great attempt for a nice, meaningful story and for that, Disney deserves all the praise.There were a few misses too, but they are very settle and a kid probably wouldn't care about them but for people who watch movies frequently they will be quite visible. The first one was the secondary characters' developement. They were for the most part just comic relief, everyone except Raya, Sisu and Namaari are just random people that showed up in Raya's way, they don't have anything memorable and they end up being very uninteresting to watch. The second and most important one is how predictable the plot is. It's a heartwarming and emotional story and that's very important but it's also one you could probably guess every step, it follows the same formula as the majority of feel-good movies and never does something to surprise you.Conclusion:Raya And The Last Dragon is a nice, fresh and memorable new addition to the Disney catalog, it excells at world-building and visuals, it can entertain people of any age group and it is benefitial for everyone because of the important and beutiful message of trust it delivers. This one is definetely a Disney movie to watch again and again, fast-paced, beautiful and adventurous, a well-made movie that will probably be a classic in a few years.Rating: 8/10",Raya and the Last Dragon
165,mickdansforth,YES! YES! YES! Now give us an animated spinoff series!,10,5 March 2021,"WOW!That was totally worth the $30 3-month rental.

166,lord_cw,start with a bang but failing as it goes,3,29 April 2021,"So much promising elements at the beginning but when it goes it went downwards, what I can say when the dragon came, it went bad and losing it magic... Especially the end is making it too classic. What I can say is the good thing is that they built it off to the end of good. Element of education should shine more and show more. What I notice more of Disney what is good. Should work more on the storyline, special effects are good.",Raya and the Last Dragon
167,ijameson,Looks great,5,14 March 2021,"But they made the ""bad guys"" good again, because they are afraid to have bad guys in their movies.The weirdest part is the message - trust others even when they prove that they cannot be trusted.Kids will love it.",Raya and the Last Dragon
168,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,A Solid Fun Hero's Journey For the Family,8,29 March 2021,"Raya and the Last Dragon, Disney's latest animated film, is a solid crowd-pleasing fantasy adventure for the whole family.In keeping with Disney's new policy to promote diversity and inclusion, Raya features a predominantly Asian-American voice cast for a story that is based in Asia.Kelly Marie Tran, coming from her disappointing Twitter-quitting run with the Star Wars franchise, puts forth an earnest performance in crafting a memorable Asian female heroine. As Raya, Tran charmingly carries the piece and shows sufficient range she hasn't had the opportunity to show in her live-action roles.Things get more interesting when Akwafina enters the picture as the dragon Sisu. As the fantastical element, she brings a playful, fast-talking comic energy that sells the magical nature of being around a mythic creature. It makes for a fun banter between her and Tran's character.The animation is stunningly gorgeous. I loved gazing into all the environments. The photographic detail the animators bring to complex textures like water and hair has improved leaps and bounds. I never felt like I had the proper time to soak in all the little details.The plot does bite off more than it can chew with the copious amount of world-building and keeping up with the numerous supporting characters that populate the story. It was difficult keeping track of the five tribes. The overall myth of the story ultimately works and the heart is there, but the overall impact of Raya's own story is weakened and it falls short of being an instant classic.There are some surprisingly funny moments. The con-baby gag is my favorite gag in a 2021 movie yet. It's perversely brilliant and I laughed at the sight of him several times and now look forward to future cosplay pictures of people dressing up their babies.However, the film's verbal gags are timed too fast for a kid's ears, which is a result of the film's rapid pacing. Only adults and teenagers can keep up with Awkwafina's quick-fire comebacks as they are likely just flying over the kids' heads. This goes twofold for children who are second language English speakers.Another behind-the-scenes detail that had me chuckling was reading the cast list and realizing amongst the Asian American cast, Alan Tudyk is among them as Tuk Tuk, Raya's fantasy pet steed, which is half armadillo, half doodlebug. A tuk-tuk is what they call a motorcycle taxi in Thailand. This is a dialogue-free role that has Tudyk contributing grunts and animal noises into a mic. Is this reverse tokenism, a hilarious waste of Alan Tudyk's talents, or the easiest voice-acting gig since Vince Diesel voicing Groot for Guardians of the Galaxy? It's hilarious any way you want to look at it.There's been online backlash about Raya and the Last Dragon culturally appropriating Asian culture. The five tribes presented in the film are an amalgamation of various Asian cultures made into their own thing. I spotted pieces of Thai, Cambodia, Vietnamese, Mongolian, and various Asian cultures being combined. Admittedly, I did raise a careful eyebrow at the beginning.The film's message about achieving harmony through inclusivity, when it presented itself, ultimately won me over and justified how the film handled the five Asian-like tribes in the story. Think about it. If a particular country was identified and used as a geographical setting from our reality, like China, Korea, or Japan, it would automatically contextualize itself and take a political stand by default.The story works on a Joseph Campbell mono-mythic level. There's nothing to get offended about here. People can get the film's message free of any real-world politics and any Asian American child can see Raya as a female Asian hero all the same. It actually worked quite well. Its message of inclusivity, which is especially relevant to the state of the world now, is what counts.",Raya and the Last Dragon
169,panta-4,Brainwashing?,5,9 March 2021,"Even the dragon became female! Amazing... how far will Disney go to brainwash all of us? OK, I understand that they stopped using male heroes for a long time, but everything and everyone in the movie with a little bit of strength and brain is now female! Males are presented as tools, except the father figure!The other thing is the story... fantasy land or the kingdom of Kumandra is made up of five different areas that together form the shape of a dragon taking inspiration from a number of different countries in Southeast Asia, including Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. Let me guess, that the bad plague (Druun) would be China?If I can go over those subliminal messages, there is lots of colourful cinematography, and average, almost mediocre, directing which tried to copy some of the Chinese recent animations! Obviously, Disney is not a leader anymore... just another follower.",Raya and the Last Dragon
170,TheMysteriousReviewer,One Epic Disney Animation Studios Movie,9,4 June 2021,"Raya and the Last Dragon is the most epic movie Disney Animation has ever done since Mulan. I have never seen how they would be able to get this intense with stunning action and a very epic story. The animation is breathtaking. The characters have a lot of engaging personalities we would see when introducing each of them throughout the film. And the message is very powerful. It's about trust. My only criticism I'll give is the comedy. It's not terrible, but it can sometimes be out of place. But everything truly makes up for it with a lot of surprises. I definitely recommend this film for those that are in for a action Disney Animation film. This would be on Disney's level of being the most intense movie they have done.",Raya and the Last Dragon
171,quiqueperezsoler,Missed chance for a Series. Too ambitious for the runtime it had. Couldn't finish it due to the cringe dialogue and too much exposition,6,12 June 2021,"I don't want to be mean or hate on the movie because, when released, you had to pay extra to watch it (when PIXAR's Soul didn't). I'd like to address the problems the movie has and why it felt underwhelming from a story perspective.The movie has gorgeous animation, there's no denying it's the department at Disney that never ceases to impress. Each movie makes leaps towards that realistically cartoonized wondrous worlds while staying true to the cultures it is drawing inspiration from both visually and musically.However, the story unfortunately left too much to be desired. I've been reading comic books since I was a kid, and when I started I chose the ones I thought would be great just by looking at the artwork in both the cover and the strips. But when I bought it and began to read it.... The story ruined a beautifully drawn piece of work. This is how Raya felt, it had this incredible animation, character designs, worldbuilding, action scenes... Everything technical and artistically related was top notch, yet, in the end, the story carries the movie.I wanted to like this movie, but the amibition they had for this story was beyond the minutes it had to explain it. So everything felt rushed, from the introduction of the towns and new characters to the landscapes and plot devices. Not to mention, the dialogue was this mix of modern talk and ancient ""epic"" eloquency that clashed in tone. I understand Disney wanted to make it accesible for kids today but that only broke the immersion of feeling transported to this magical world.And that's just it, Disney wanted to make this movie accesible for EVERYONE. It wanted to have modern talk for fear the kids wouldn't ""tune out"", it had a over-explained story that in essence was simple enough to not have to have these sequences of exposition and backstory blabbering instead of showing us visually or simply leaving it to the imagination of the audience. The plot and worldbuilding felt ""chewed up"" for an audience the movie didn't think capable of following.And because it tried so hard on the emotionally heavy scenes, these felt weightless. Because the evil felt generic and predictable, just like the plot. The endless exposition and character introduction on the first act revealed ALL the beats the movie was going to follow. I was able to guess every single decision and plot turn without doubt, rendering the movie boring and unengaging.I happen to love Animation and Computer Graphics, so I was able to draw enjoyment from the absolutely awe-inspiring visuals. And the other reason I could find enjoyment was thanks to those things that weren't explained to me by a given character or that happen to develop naturally during the story, which essentially were the magical creatures and the characters that join Raya during her journey. By allowing them to ""present"" themselves and have sort of a journey of their own in this story, it felt engaging and realised.Everything in this movie would have been much more engaging, enriching and meaningful if it had had time to slow down and recreate itself in the beautiful landscapes and lands they travel. Also, some characters were never used or were taken out of the picture because there were so many to follow during the movie. And this detracted from Raya's own personal growth. Because the writters had to flesh out other characters in the story. In a ""coloquial way"" they ""half-assed"" many characters instead of ""full-assing"" the few that were more relevant.IN CONCLUSION, I wish the movie would have ""trusted"" (get it?) the audience more in every aspect. We don't need a dumbed down, modernly-mixed dialogue; we don't need a lot of oral exposition if this can be explain visually; we don't prefer one dimensional characters whose lack of layers unintentionally make them cliche; we don't hate the fact that this world feels unique, creative, wondrous and immense, with a rich and potentially engaging backstory if you are going to simply glance over it robbing it of its importance. Perhaps in the minds of the creative minds behind the movie, lied a brainstorm of interconnected ideas for this reimagined earth and each of this characters. So don't settle for an hour and a half runtime, go for a series treatment, let us rejoice in the world you have created. I have a feeling Disney would make a show out of this movie, and if they don't that's a shame because it definitely has the grounds and seeds to do so.",Raya and the Last Dragon
172,nouyrigatantoine,a good moment,7,25 May 2021,"Despite a bombastic start and a few scenes graphically similar to a video game cinematic, the film is likable and gripping, with adventure humor and good feelings.",Raya and the Last Dragon
173,greggman,Disney's worst animated movie since the mid 80s,3,14 March 2021,"Disney needs to find some new directors (and just guessing, pull out the marketing committees)As nearly all the other reviews have pointed out the writing here just didn't work and personally I wasn't impressed by the animation or the visuals. They aren't at some amazing level above other things out there. CGI and animated movies are mostly trivial (technically) to make in 2021. I'm not trying to down play all the effort required to make all the assets and animation but you can no longer just wow us with computer graphics. That ship sailed. Story is what matters and it's missing here.As for the writing, the main conflict made absolutely zero sense. Raya wants to find the last dragon. Okay, no one would be trying to stop her. They're only trying to stop her from stealing gem shards that protect, or they believe protect, their cities. Of course no one would want their piece stolen.No reason is given to hide Sisu except ""trust me, you should stay hidden"". The most obvious reaction to anyone seeing Sisu is the same reaction they get when they actually see her. They all want in on saving the world. Duh! So why the conflict? Oh, bad writing.Even at the end either Raya has all the pieces or Namaari it doesn't matter. All that matters is, at least as far as they know at the time, is that all the pieces come together with Sisu. Raya could have handed all the pieces to Namaari and her same goal up to that point would have been achieved. I get the ultimate goal is about trust but the characters to that point believe if all the pieces are together and there's a living dragon everything will be fine. Good writing would have let that happen (given the story to that point) and then had it not be fine and then find a way to show that trust was the important thing. Instead, for absolutely no reason whatsoever, Raya and Namaari have a big fight with absolutely zero reason. What was Raya's goal in that fight? Zero sense. Ridiculously bad writing.I know they aren't the same ""studio"" but last night I happened to re-watch ""Ratatouille"" . They are light night and day in terms of writing and emotional impact. And, what really sucks, at least for me, I liked that this was loosely inspired by South East Asian culture. But, the fact the writing was so bad will have the added consequence of this movie probably not doing as well as a well written one and instead of blaming the bad writing the execs in charge will blame the theme and pressure will be on to stick things they've done before :(",Raya and the Last Dragon
174,MovieWarfare,"amazing visuals, great characters, exhilarating action sequences, a beautiful score and terrific performances",8,7 March 2021,"Raya and the Last Dragon is an original (oh thank god) Disney animation movie that was overshadowed because it's $30 on Disney+ and it came out the same day as the WandaVision finale. I was intrigued to watch this because of it being focused on Asian culture and the fact that it wasn't going to be a musical like Frozen. It felt like the Disney Animation Studios were going to do something different and I liked that. The premise ""Long ago, in the fantasy world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. However, when sinister monsters known as the Druun threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, those same monsters have returned, and it's up to a lone warrior, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), to track down the last dragon and stop the Druun for good"". So is this a great surprise or a very unwelcomed one?I want to get this straight off my chest but I love that this focuses on Southeast Asia culture. It's nice to see it get more representation in mainstream movies. I also really love the world-building with the Dragons, the overpowering evil force the Druun and the 5 tribes. It feels familiar such as in Avatar: The Last Airbender but in Raya, the world is still different enough to set it apart from others. It is such an interesting world that I wouldn't mind more movies or shows set in this universe.The animation is very breathtaking and gorgeous. It's very colorful and there are different variety of locations from the bustling city of Talon and the snowy plains of Spine but all of them are visually stunning. I also have to praise James Newton Howard for the score is as there is some rapid music for the more intense scenes and some uplifting scores for the more hopeful moments. The entire score feels like it represents the world of Raya and southeast Asia perfectly and it elevates the movie to another level. It also has a great song in the credit ""Lead the Way"" by Jhené Aiko. There are also some surprisingly great hand to hand combat and swordplay that would put a fair amount of action movies to shame. It's genuinely got some exciting action sequences!The titular character herself Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) is also excellent. She's a fierce and courageous warrior princess with some swagger but is flawed in not trusting people and not believing the world can become united again. She never gets to the point of unlikeable and to a certain extent the movie shows she's right in some ways. I thought the dragon Sisu (Awkwafina) might be unbearably annoying from the trailers but she is pretty fun to watch. Raya's developing friendship with the contrasting view of Sisu is enjoyable and Sisu encouraging Raya to change is convincing. Namaari (Gemma Chan) the ""villain"" is also wonderful and her rivalry with Raya are some of the best parts of the movie. What makes Namaari work as a character is that she is not evil but also flawed like Raya but both have common ground with each other. Throughout the movie instead of wanting Raya to win, you want her and Namaari to solve their conflict and trust one another. The other supporting characters are hilarious and loveable as well. Boun (Izaac Wang) is funny as the owner of a shrimp boat restaurant, Tong (Benedict Wong) is a scary warrior giant with a heart of gold and there is a toddler con artist, need I say more? Every voice actor in this movie does a phenomenal job in their role, especially Kelly Marie Tran as Raya which is just perfect casting.However, I do wish it explored the supporting cast a little bit more through something like a flashback because they just feel like they're along for the ride than significantly important. Furthermore, the story is very predictable and there is genuinely no surprises as it hits a lot of the clichés which is slightly disappointing. The movie also has a surprising amount of exposition throughout the movie instead of just at the beginning which slows the pacing.Overall, Raya and the Last Dragon is one of the best original Disney Animation movies in a long time. It's filled with amazing visuals, great characters, exhilarating action sequences, a beautiful score and terrific performance from the voice actors. It just does a lot right. I loved the movie and hope Disney does more movies like Raya and The Last Dragon. Just don't do a $30 premium service and just make it free with Disney+ like Soul okay?",Raya and the Last Dragon

177,pronitmallick,The 'g' in the dragon is good not great,7,8 March 2021,Raya and the Last Dragon is a film that starts with lots of elements which intrigue our interest. The presentation of the film is good from start to finish and direction is good also. All the characters are enjoyable as well as adorable including the main. The pacing may seem a little bit fast but considering the length of the movie it seems ok. In terms of story the movie is quite predictable with nothing out of the box but it can still soothe your mind with the flow of elements.

Blending imagery and mythology from several Southeast Asian cultures into its own vision. It's a good and entertaining classic movie that focuses on themes of trust and the importance of finding a support system of friends and family. In the final act they could have done something bolder and different. Nevertheless Raya and the Last Dragon is a beautifully animated, action-packed hero's journey.

180,Clank_Zoka,"A Very Epic and Entertaining Disney Flick, But Feels Familiar",8,6 March 2021,"About time we got a new 3-D animated Disney, obviously during this heck hole, it'd be on Disney Plus, for now through Premier Access, so for those who don't want to pay for it, you'll have to wait another 3 or 4 months, I know it sucks but hey what can ya do?, this seems to be a little different from their usual stuff, no singing and... not that many celebrity voices?, it has a rather epic concept and looks like the film itself could be epic, with dragons, big battles, creativity and the usual Disney stuff, this could be great!, I was really looking forward to this!, besides the teaser, I avoided watching the other trailers so nothing is spoiled and just going in knowing little as possible, it was originally supposed to come out in cinemas but knowing what's going on, that wasn't case, so it did make sense for it to be come to Disney Plus, so I quickly brought it yesterday and watched it which felt weird watching it at home and..... yeah as expected I really liked it, although it doesn't quite leave the biggest impact on me and it has familiar elements, it's still entertaining enough, so let's talk about it!In the land Kumandra, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) is out looking for all these gem pieces across these other nations, Fang, Talon, Tail & Spine to try and bring peace and restore Kumandra after some evil spirits known as Drunn has turned people across the land into stone, including Raya's own father, she summons the last luckdragon named Sisu (Awkwafina) and they both set out to find all the pieces while other nations are out to look for them while also looking for the last dragon coincidentally, now a lot of the Disney 3-D animated films have been rather formulaic and very repeated too, like even though most of them are different films concept wise, but story and structure is basically kind of the same, this one is also applies which unfortunately means if you know the Disney formula, you know what will happen in this film, but to the film's credit, it still keeps the audience engaged and interested at the very least, the story may not be all that original but it's still rather interesting within the events of the film and the world building, the first 15 minutes felt like your run of the mill Disney 3-D animated film and it plays by the books in the most average and basic way, but still fascinating, after that the film gets legit better, it gives us a good reason as to why we should care about what's going on, it's get even more epic and emotional and... even funnier, like the opening, it does feel rather familiar in terms of humour and where the gang goes to, but I don't mind a bit of repeating, hence why most of the 3-D animated films from Disney and Pixar are always very formulaic and derivative, but still keep the story interesting and events more on the edge of your seats and this film also does that.., but other times, you know what will happen, there are many great scenes in how emotional and epic it is and a lot of the scenes really stand out, others are been there done that, I like the message of the movie too, it really packs a punch, along with a satisfying ending, the idea of the film sounds cool and it is well presented and done justice too, so overall the story has good pacing, mostly decent comedy, great epic action and also nicely done emotional bits, but what keeps this away from being great is just how familiar and formulaic the whole story is, it's just too cliched and repeated, but still well presented with great world building and it is very entertaining, so at least it's trying and it does success for the most part, but I'd be lying if I said it's been done better before.The animation is wonderful as always, lots of awesome details in this wonderful world!, the characters are great especially in how they look in that traditional Disney way, I love the look of Sisu and what she can do, she might be the biggest highlight of the animation, but everything else is really outstanding, including the world of Krumandra, the epic battles, the speed and movement, along with excellent realistic textures in the water and rain, it's just another really fantastic looking Disney film, it's really cool how Disney put so much effort into their animated flicks, this one is no exception, however despite how great this film looks, just like it's story, this film looks also very familiar, the characters look like characters you'd see in like Overwatch with some of the human characters and Raya looks like Moana a little bit, that and there are so areas that look like they were entirely ripped off from other stuff like games and movies, it just looks like something you'd see while playing a game or in a live action film, but none the less, the animation is still a pleasing sight to view and another wonderful looking film from Disney!.The characters are mostly entertaining and quite memorable, but not all of them are all that much of a stand out, Raya is a good main character, she's pleasant and very likeable, but is another warrior hero trying to restore peace and harmony, not much interesting things to her but she is likeable and endearing enough to be a good main character, I just wish there was a bit more to her to be honest, Sisu is the best character in the film, she's really funny, she's has great purpose and can be very creative and enjoyable, the other side characters are also very memorable, like Tong (Benedict Wong), Boun (Izaac Wang), Little Noi (Thalia Tran) and Raya's pet companion Tuk Tuk (Alan Tudyk), they all play a big part and are all just great supporting characters!, Namaari (Gemma Chan) is a decent villainous character, she can be intimidating and rather interesting as a emotional character, but is mostly just a villain with a goal, not much else to say about her, the voice acting is pretty great, Kelly Marie Tran is pretty good as Raya, Awkwafina is fantastic as Sisu, Benedict Wong is wonderful, same with Sandra Oh, Gemma Chan, Alan Tudyk and so much more, so despite some a rather good basic hero and a okay average villain, the characters offer lots of great entertainment and unique comedy to the big screen, along with great heart and emotion, but the voice acting really brings some life to even all the the characters!James Newton-Howard's score is just as great to as his other scores, but this one feels the most atmospheric I heard so far!, love the music!, really captures the feel and world of this filmIt's not quite as imaginative or original as most previous Disney 3-D animated films, but it's still an epic and grand film to watch!, Raya and the Last Dragon isn't anything new or groundbreaking, but very enjoyable and offers so much to please any viewer, with stunning animation, fantastic voice acting, fun and enjoyable characters, satisfying humour, decent story, good message, nice music with pretty good world building along with good heart, although it does feel too familiar with it's predictable story and even it's cliches and very basic opening, along with a rather okay hero and villain, there could of been so much more to these two characters but they are fine for what they are, but other then that, it's another mostly solid Disney film, better then what was on Premier Access before, even though I haven't seen it, but anyways, if you are a big Disney fan, give it a watch, but maybe wait until it's free on Disney Plus then pay £20 for it, but if you or anyone is desperate to watch it, it wouldn't hurt to spend a bit of money on it, I'm excited for what Disney has next on their 3-D animated film list, this may not be perfect but it's certainly on the right path!.I'm going to give Raya and the Last Dragon a 8/10",Raya and the Last Dragon

182,blackoutH,"Stunning animation, solid story",8,1 August 2021,"I still can't shake the negative feelings towards Disney with the recent controversies with the Mulan movie and in a way it seems somehow they are trying to get rid of the bad image with the cast on this one (which was brilliant don't get me wrong) but no one can deny they it's a good artistic work.From a technical perspective as always the animation is brilliant, the movements of the characters and specially the landscapes are simply incredible. From the story perspective it's not a ground breaking one but it's still engaging and fresh, specially with the Asian culture elements and cultural background coming from multiple Asian countries, it feels like something new.Of course it is still a Disney flick so it has some predictable moments (these are targeted mostly to kids after all) however, the lesson it's far from simple, sure it feels like it if you narrow your mindset but isn't lack of trust the root of a lot of the evil we are surrounded these days? It's an extremely relevant message, which I believe might seem over simplified on the context of the movie but it can serve as a wider lesson.Fresh, visually beautiful, great acting voice and a solid story with a nice pace to it.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Lighting was amazing. The character designs & world designs were fantastic & really brought the Southeast Asian flare. I freaked out a lot from the world design, i wanted to explore every city & learn about every culture of every clan. Honestly, nothing I say will do the movie justice, you just have to see it for yourself. It's visually stunning.Story wise, I don't think I'd put it above Mulan, which is probably what others could compare it to. Raya was a great character & i loved her story arc. The little boy was cute too. However the balance between character development with the adventure was.... I'd say this movie would have benefited from being a little longer. The lore was really cool, & the happy ending was satisfying. Besides pacing, it was really an enjoyable story.This is honestly going in my top 20 Disney films. I would say the animation & world building was the highlight of the film, which is why I loved it so much. And Raya as this warrior princess is a great addition to the Disney princess roster.

192,NotMoreMovies,"Great movie, but confusing message (VERY minor spoilers)",7,3 June 2021,"First off, I'd like to say that Disney has done it again. This movie was well written, edited, and executed.Dragons are the ""harmony"" of the world, but because of something humans did, they slowly lost their power and dumped the last of their energy into saving humanity, but they were too late to save themselves. Hoping to restore harmony, the main character's father called for a diplomatic meeting in hopes of restoring the world to its former glory. All looked to be going well until one of the factions betrayed him, throwing the world into further darkness. In response, the daughter (the main character) went in search of the legend of the last dragon hoping that it could help her restore the world. After finding that dragon, she tried to convince the humans that they should trust each other more and that that was the reason the world plunged into darkness.(Here's the minor spoiler) The dragon convinced her to trust the daughter of the queen that betrayed her. Taking the dragon's advice, she convinced a peaceful meeting where it appeared the other daughter was going to be cooperative and all would be well. SURPRISE! That daughter pulled a weapon for some reason (albeit hesitantly) showing that you can't ever trust anyone.So what's really the point of this movie? Can we trust? Can't we? Beats me.Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and it's a must-see, but I still don't get the point. It's actually realistic in my opinion. NO, you can never trust your enemy, but sometimes coordinating with them is necessary.(7/10) Just for the confusion, otherwise 9/10.",Raya and the Last Dragon
193,cristinalinderman,A straightforward enjoyable animated film.,6,9 March 2021,"(Rating 6.5/10)
* There are images during the end credits *The directors' Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada plus crew brought a straightforward enjoyable animated film. The story is about a warrior named Raya and to save humanity she seeks the last dragon. A film that shows the struggle of trust while putting the hardest issue of being betrayed to the test. I found it very clever the way they were uniting the clans during the journey. It was a good film though the unfolding of the journey was so simple and rushed, there were so many things that could have been done during the journey, I still liked it but it had the potential for so much more. I thought this one would make it to my top list, and I had high expectations of Raya but it couldn't achieve what the others had. My favorites are Brave, Frozen, and Moana, I'm still looking forward to a Raya sequel although it looks like a film that doesn't give space for another one.The characters were incredible especially the kid Boun and the baby Noi. They were so much fun and the movie was entertaining due to their hilarious moments. I can't forget about the main character Raya, she was such an interesting strong character but I felt that they could have shown more to her storyline. Maybe a little bit of adventure of her with her adorable pet Tuk Tuk before finding the last dragon. I felt how the tone changed when Sisu, the last dragon, made her appearance hence how everything was falling so easily in place. The significance of the antagonist the Druun, was well thought of it goes hand in hand with the theme of the film and it reveals at the beginning who the real antagonists are but it was represented in a standard way. Being that said Raya and Namaari's short confrontations needed more depth or more scenes between them to value more their struggle.The composer James Newton Howard set rightfully the atmosphere. One can feel the essence of a beautiful culture through his music.",Raya and the Last Dragon

After watching Moana, which we all thought was great, we were looking forward our movie night.The SPX are fantastic as you would expect from Disney. The idea is great but it simply doesn't deliver. The dragon is just annoying in dragon and human form. A baby? Come on, even my 8 year old was confused and laughed at how silly it was and not in a good way.The story is just boring with the pacing all over the place.It should have been great, it really should have but it's just Meh...",Raya and the Last Dragon
195,ksdouglas-23618,I can't remember any of their names...,6,9 March 2021,"Obviously, the animation is outstanding per usual with a Disney property. I mean this thing looks unreal on a 4K display and for the most part, that was a good 90% of the reason why I watched this thing.I'm not saying the movie is bad, or isn't worth your time. It is worth a look, really. It's just at the same time, the story itself is typical. The characters are bog standard High Fantasy D&D starter pack level typical. You can predict every characters' arc the moment you meet them. I'm nowhere near the target audience, and this film is clearly geared towards children 13 years old and younger. Here's the thing , just because your target audience is mostly children, this doesn't give you an excuse to oversimplify your plot.Here's the deal: Raya: And the Last Dragon is an all right movie, full stop. It's an all right movie sitting on a top mountain of unused potential.For one, I enjoy the Southeast Asian inspired world. It's amazing, though at times I feel this influence was on a cosmetic level and didn't dwell to deep into that cultural treasure trove. At times the world felt no different than any other high fantasy setting in popular culture.Moving on from that, the characters themselves lacked a huge chunk of development. Raya felt stagnate throughout the narrative and her character growth didn't change much at all from start to finish. The same could be said with all the other characters in this story. The fact that I can't remember any of their names says a lot. Besides Con-Baby, the other characters (even the dragon) are just.... there, mostly.These characters embark on a (rather easy) quest for a magic McGuffin crystal ball that can save the world and simultaneously banish all the evil from the world. In other words: a super convenient plot device to end the story with.Did this story need this McGuffin to work? No, it did not. It just erases all the complexity that this story should have had.Namaari (I had to look up her name) was tic-for-tac reskinned Prince Zuko from 'Avatar: The Last Airbender.' This made her character extremely predictable and I knew exactly how her arc was going to end the moment she was introduced.The dragon character wasn't that much interesting either. Just your run-on-the-mill chatter box comic relief character.In the end, the story ends exactly how you thought it would. There was also a lack of memorable musical scores.At the end of the day, 'Raya: And the Last Dragon' is an easy, fun movie to watch with the family. Where it lacks in complexity it dominates in its highly detailed and excellent animation.",Raya and the Last Dragon

To me, it feels that the main idea behind this movie was to ""do something with asian people"".

The graphic details in the movie - the world created beautifully rendered. While the characters' proportions are typically Disney cartoonic, the way the hair and fur moves, all looks very realistic. The animators did an outstanding job.SUMMARY: A beautifully created movie that oozes with likeable characters which are superbly voiced (One of my favourite character is ""Boun"").

Probably one of the better animated movies that Disney has put out in a while(excluding Pixar). The animation was great. The comedy was great. This 35 year old dude was laughing throughout. Between the armadillo and monkeys with baby... lol.The only thing I didn't like about the film was the dust turning people to stone tie in. That seemed very... Avengerish. I still loved it though. Disney really fleshed out brainstorming notes for an entire universe. They could easily focus on each of the areas/tribes and bring this world to life in the future. I'm here for it.One other side note: I'm surprised that I haven't seen anyone mention anything about the credit/debt scene. This isn't a spoiler really but there is a scene where the characters bring up credit being a wonderful thing and debt. And then nothing else was ever said about it. It seemed weird and somewhat subliminal to me. Is Disney going to give us a storyline in the future about debt and how credit should be used responsibly? ... I mean, the schools don't teach kids about personal finance so if Disney is going down that rabbit hole, I hope they do it in a good way.",Raya and the Last Dragon

209,andrewtisler,"A fantastic Disney animated feature with a powerful message about trust, gorgeous visuals, and a well-paced story",10,9 November 2021,"Walt Disney Animation Studios, since the release of ""Tangled"" in 2010, has been getting very intense with their later productions, going for epic, grand features with breathtaking visuals and fantastic environments, as well as memorable, entertaining characters and big action sequences. ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" continues Disney's streak of powerful, stunning animated productions, featuring a well-paced narrative about trust, enjoyable characters, gorgeous animation, and surprisingly a lot of honest emotion to make it a highlight for the 2020s.Set in a fictional, reimagined Earth known as ""Kumandra"", the story follows Raya, the title character who is the warrior princess of Kumandra's Heart Land, as she ventures out to find the last dragon Sisu to revive the Dragon Gem and bring her people back together again. Along the way, she learns a little bit about trust and builds relationships with other Kumandra citizens whose families were attacked by a plague known as the ""Druun"". The story is very well-done and properly handled, and is full of fast-paced action and world-building momentum, as well as honest emotion and a tiny bit of humor, particularly from Sisu's character arc.Raya is a very relatable heroine because of her incapability to trust anyone, which stems from a childhood experience where she foolishly trusted Namaari, the princess of Kumandra's Fang Land, which resulted in the Dragon Gem getting broken into pieces and scattered across the world. I love how over the course of the movie, she develops relationships with others who, like her, have become orphaned because of the Druun, such as Tong from Spine and Boun from Tail Land, and becomes Sisu's best friend in the process. Sisu herself is a very scene-stealing character, and the real reason this movie is so moving, powerful, and action-packed. Her wacky and insecure but spiritual nature makes her the most entertaining heroine in the entire movie.Like with all Disney movies, ""Raya and the Last Dragon""'s animation is beautiful, well-crafted, and stunningly realistic. This is perhaps Disney's best visual style yet, showing how much has come since the start of the studio's animation styles with ""Snow White"" back in 1937. It's very breathtaking and full of cool character designs, and is heavily influenced by Anime-style animation used primarily in the works of Hayao Miyazaki, which also helped to influence Disney/Pixar's ""Luca"".And last but not least, James Newton Howard's musical score provides enough instrumentation to help push the story and action forward, so as to help with the momentum and tone of the script. This is definitely his best score on a Disney animated feature since ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" in 2001. It's grand, epic, and bombastic. Surprisingly, there are no songs in this movie. But that's a good thing, as the story and action is entertaining enough on its own.""Raya and the Last Dragon"" is definitely a new Disney classic, filled with gorgeous, breathtaking animation, strong characters, a well-paced story, and an epic musical score, as well as a positive message about the importance of trust. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to see an animated movie that tells you who you should and shouldn't trust and features some of the most breathtaking animation ever made in history.",Raya and the Last Dragon

218,TruView,...was a condensed version of 'Avatar: The Legend of Korra',6,18 March 2021,"This story represents a clear break from the Disney classic in terms of striving for an even balance between that male and female dynamic we love so much - a difficult task in the best of times; Even so, producers had decidedly taken the nuclear option off the table. Many of the tertiary characters representing extended family or members of the collective lacked a certain kind of cohesion, despite their proximity to each other and to the main cast of characters. This was so apparent that the plot literally had to justify and explain it away at the cost of that special intangible magic that brings the story to life for so many. Fortunately, it's something only adults will notice as younger minds still yet lack the complexity of strong analysis.The one caution prospective patrons of this film might consider as Christian parents or just parents is a hint of the potential budding of an amorous relationship between two female characters - again, still very much below the radar of most younger minds (although subconsciously???). Secondarily, while a strong female cast was indeed welcome, it certainly felt like they overshot the mark by having virtually all the females seeming either excessively ruthless, violent, cutthroat, or untrusting.For anyone familiar with Nickelodean's Avatar franchise -particularly the second arc, about an airbender named Korra- you will recognize so many of the same features here in this story. It is essentially a super condensed version of that entire series packed into about two hours. The signature brand of innocence Disney has sported for so long is fastly slipping away. Already, many of the trappings of modernity can be seen in this picture but enjoyment is still within reach of most.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Oh also ninja-thief baby.. Why? Just no. Stop.Voiceovers (english) are bad. Someone didn't even bother to edit the voice of main character when she was a kid to when she's an adult. But that's not even it. Obviously this movie was made for asian folks first and foremost. The thing is.. They didn't even bother to make a proper dub for english version.The movie is bad overall, a carnaval of mediocrity. And considering that came from Disney is just insulting. Yes. They can make a mistake or 2. But this is just a cumulation of wrongs that should never have came from Disney.Looks like Disney's looking for a way to sneak in into asian movie market, which isn't wrong, or bad.. But I wish they did some (serious) quality control beforehand.",Raya and the Last Dragon
226,insatiableaskeri,Unequivocally good one,10,27 September 2021,"I was baffled by all those bad reviews and low scores that this movie received. What's wrong with you ppl? I was crying out loud while watching...
I felt ineffable satisfaction with the animation and depth of the story. It was shown how humans are by nature greedy, ferocious and devious. However, the moral is a mutual respect and trust! Throughout the film we can notice how Raya's character was changing. Firstly, she was deeply saddened by her father's death. Then, she happened to completely plunge into the pursuit of the chunks of magic stone. Next, the rage and fury overwhelmed her after a sudden demise of Sisu. Finally, there came pride and peace after long-lasting struggles and fightings.It seems to me that this movie would be helpful for everyone as it really brings this idea of unity and mutual support.",Raya and the Last Dragon

I like Disney movies (I have a soft corner for them) and I try to watch all of them and this one is a good, just not great. The story does have a message and while the characters are not entirely unique, they get the point across. And it feels like the movie takes a different view of things, like no, dragons are not all big, serious and scary and all burly people are not scary.

233,DrDarkness,One of the easily forgettable Disney movies,3,6 March 2021,"When I first saw the trailers, they didn't strike any emotion in me. Maybe, because the protagonist looks too generic, even for Disney. She has almost exactly the same face as Elsa/Anna/Rapunzel/Moana/any CGI Disney princess.But, I still wanted to see the movie myself. I assured myself that it would be more probable to find it better than expected, as I didn't really have any expectations.Whelp, I was wrong. Aside from the animation, which is gorgeous, the movie comes through as a luke-warm experience. The characters are two-dimensional, the plot is unimaginative, the jokes aren't funny (I didn't chuckle even once) and the world itself is just ""meh"". The dragon looks like the animators modeled it after characters from My Little Pony and - I never, EVER expected to say this - I thought it was just an awkward character altogether. Like a watered-down version of Mushu from Mulan.Did I enjoy the movie? No. I constantly glanced at my phone to see how much time was left.Will I watch it again? I will not. It's been 24 hours since I saw the movie and I barely remember half of it.Do I recommend it?

Some of the character development is weak and there are some other quibbles that make it much weaker than other movies, but it ended strong and was funny through the middle (thank you awkwafina). The start is the weakest part which is a compliment in itself i think. It will entertain at the least, but it wont measure up to tangled or the first frozen in my opinion. it's more second frozen territory as far as story telling goes. The end is really solid though.",Raya and the Last Dragon
239,Aria_Athena,I despised the dragon,4,27 June 2021,"I'll try to put my bias aside for the sake of this review, but I personally hated the film. There are many things to appreciate, but the movie managed to piss me off in every turn and if it wasn't for writing this, I would give it the ace that I think it truly deserves. Now that I got some hate out of my chest:The animation is beautiful, I really enjoyed the music and the movies has some moving moments. By far my favourite aspect was the directing. It's ""shot"" very well and I find that it's rare to see this in an animated film.I'll try to go over the parts that bothered me the most. The movie starts with the main character, Raya, narrating what happened 500 years ago. I've grown to not be a fun of that, but I understand sometimes it helps to introduce the audience to the world and get thing going. Not here though, since we get more exposition 3 minutes later, a lot of that information is being repeated throughout the film and we even get a flashback where we see what the dragons did. Not only that, but the information we get is wrong. She says everyone lived in harmony alongside dragons, until the Druun appeared. The dragons managed to push it back, but all that remained of them was a gem infused with their magic and that gem was what created infighting and split the people into five lands. Sisu though, the dragon, says later on that the Druun was born from human discord, has always been around and waited for a moment of weakness to attack. So thanks for the narration that provided no insight on how the world was before the Druun.I fully know this is a nitpick, but that's what happens when I'm not enjoying the story. Raya starts the movie around the age of 12 I think, yet is voiced by the same 30 years old actress. It sounds very wrong. She befriends the princess of another land, Namaari, who is around her age and who 5 minutes later betrays her trust and starts the sequence of events that leads to the gem shattering and the Druun once again laying waste to the land and petrifying most of the world's population. The premise is that Raya must bring all the pieces together, stop the Druun and thus unpetrify everyone, including her father.Now we skip to 6 years later, when Namaari is the antagonist and these two have it out for each other. I'm assuming something else happened during those 6 year? Their rivalry is crucial to the story, yet the motivations are so weak. I would understand Raya still holding some ill feelings towards Namaari, but she now has deep trust issues and seriously dislikes her. She was tricked by another 12 year old she had just met, who was following her mother's instructions, not exactly the deepest of betrayals. As for Namaari, hell if I know what her problem is and why she is giving her so much sass every time she comes across her.I'm going to mostly skip over the middle of the movie and talk about the theme the movie slaps you in the face with every time it gets a chance: trust. Raya is very distrustful of people, while Sisu believes in them too much. That is supposed to be Raya's flaw. The thing is, she is proven right most of the time. The first piece they collect is on the corpse of one of the leaders who let most of her people die, hid herself in boobytrapped tomb, got stuck and then knowing she would die, boobytrapped her body too. The person who had the second piece tricked Sisu and threatened to feed her to the Druun unless she relinquished the gems. The holder of the third one, while he proved to be harmless, had still laid a trap and then they needed to be rescued. With the fourth one, Sisu convinces Raya to trust Namaari and contact her. Well, Namaari pulled a crossbow on them and started making demands. While Raya did mishandle the situation, which led to the temporary death of Sisu, it wasn't really due to lack of trust, since Namaari was really close to shooting them.During the end, Raya comes to the realisation that it is all about trust. The dragons may be all gone, but it was trust that made the gem work before and it is trust what will make it work again. Like, literally. It wasn't just the dragon's magic, it was also the fact that they trusted Sisu, which filled her heart with conviction and drove the Druun away. I thought that was absolutely terrible. She didn't bring the lands together, as it was her father's dream, she just made friends with random people from each land and then they ""trusted"" each other. I'm putting the word trust in quotations, because all the above happened when Raya, her friends and Namaari had all the 5 pieces, were completely surrounded by Druun and the gems were losing power. It's easy to ""trust"" when it's the end of the line and you have literally no other choice. All of them were friends and trusted each other, except for Namaari, so Raya takes the first step, gives her her piece and turns into stone. Then the rest follow. Namaari saw a way to escape, but didn't, making the only meaningful decision in the movie and redeeming herself. She puts the pieces together, stands next to the rest and gets petrified. Here is another nitpick, throughout the whole film, whenever anyone turns into stone, they first take a certain pose. It's not subtle at all, the movie makes a point out of it. Raya did too, yet the rest of them somehow took their own pose. Anyway, it works, the dragons come back this time, Sisu gets resurrected for some reason and everyone comes together. I assumed the dragons unpetrified because this time it was humans that trusted each other. There was a line earlier, ""maybe the dragons didn't come back because we don't deserve them"". Really unsure about that, either way, I didn't like the ending at all.Enough with the story, voice acting was meh at best. Raya was the definition of average, Namaari I liked and the kid was good. Sisu was the worst, I found Awkwafina to be a terrible miscast, she got on my nerves with almost every line. Didn't help that the dialog was rather bad, in her case bloody awful. By far the worst aspect of the film and the main reason this movie left me with such a sour taste.Overall the animation was great, the directing was great, I liked the music, the voice acting was mediocre, the story was bad, the characters were weak and Sisu was absolutely terrible. Also, while it has nothing to do with the movie, I noticed most of the voice actors were of Asian decent, yet the voices had the most American accents ever and I just found that funny.",Raya and the Last Dragon
240,pierreolivier-21287,Good but blockbuster feeling,8,28 June 2021,"A blockbuster like Disney!I get a feeling of Kung Fu panda, beautiful colors and energy from How to train your dragon.

Some darkness and light. Some cute characters and animals.The humour was on point.It's a good mixture from many inspirations.It's good but I got one station...

The story is exactly what you would expect with no surprises at all. The characters are just okay; They're not particularly funny or unique or deep in any way. The message is the same old kind of milquetoast from Disney and doesn't really say anything profound or new....My point is this film takes no chances at all, and unfortunately that refusal to depart from the formula for success established in countless movies like this before makes this one ultimately forgettable.",Raya and the Last Dragon

248,watcher101,Would have been much better as a series,5,15 March 2021,"It was pretty good, but it suffered from a major flaw, and that was not enough time to establish everything. Raya literally jumps from one location to the next, quickly accomplishing her goal, and gaining a new party member. But the problem with this is that everything happened too fast, and the relationship and the bonds of the characters don't really develop enough for them to really be that meaningful. We don't get enough time to get to know anyone or feel much for them, yet they're supposed to be the heart and soul of the movie. The characters' arcs are rushed too and we don't get enough development on them, instead they just shove each of them into their roles without really having any story and are told they're super close, but we don't see or feel it. It kind of reminded me of what they did for the Avatar: The Last Airbender live-action movie and how quickly everything was just mashed together. Even Raya, the main character, doesn't really have enough time to develop. I mean, don't get me wrong, the story was good and it was a decent movie, they just didn't have enough time to do things the way they needed to be done or explore the land, the lore, or get to know the characters. This would have worked so much better as a TV series where they actually had the time to explore the characters and the places, and get to know everyone and establish a connection and get us invested, but instead it was just quickly mashed together into something that, while enjoyable, is ultimately forgettable. Maybe someday they'll remake it as a series where they can do things properly, it would definitely come out a lot better.",Raya and the Last Dragon
249,infoalwaysacritic,The uplifting story for this time,9,11 March 2021,"In a time rife with division over ideology and morality, there is a need for a story of hope and that is where Raya comes in.Raya is a guardian, raised to protect the heart of the land, both literally and figuratively speaking. When the heart is broken, it then falls to her to bring back the source of that heart to overcome the blight that has befallen everything around her.Raya and the Last Dragon attempts to tell a story that is difficult to do successfully and while there are plenty of opportunities for technical criticism around the plot, pacing and even some animation issues, it is the heart that shines through and brings enough to overcome those hurdles for those looking for an uplifting tale.Turn on Raya and you're encouraged to forget the real world long enough to find messages of hope through unity and trust for one another. These themes permeate the dialogue, the music and even the artistic style of the film. It is in a word: beautiful to look at. Bright colours bring life in contrast to the sinister dark purple orbs that represent the scourge that steals life, freezing people as stone statues in its wake. In keeping with asian influences, the story has many shades of grey in the characters, leaving room for redemption and weakness in the heroes and protagonists.Of course, there are criticisms to be levelled, in particular in the realm of disjointed transitions for a few scenes with awkward fade outs or lack of attention to background animation. In one case a large number of cats use what appears to be the same animation script, creating the unnatural appearance of them all moving at exactly the same speed and with too much similarity.The plot follows a video game trope, and the story itself isn't all that original, borrowing from many other genres, but in Disney's case, this is not without precedent or without its merit. It was refreshing to see major characters engage in all out mortal physical battle. This is rare for Disney, even if there are some convenient issues around the end of the film that if dwelt on too closely, you might lose the whimsical joy of the film's message.Apart from the heavy handed moral ideology, which is common for Disney films to begin with, Raya doesn't address many of the social issues in political debate today. Diversity doesn't feel forced, and other issues aren't shoe-horned in with pretentious and unnecessary scenes. As a result, it does its job well of presenting a heart-warming and uplifting tale.",Raya and the Last Dragon
250,AllanSmitheee,Animation and voice talent barely save formulaic Disney,6,19 March 2021,"Disney has always been good for gorgeous animation and talented voice acting. However, they lack in the story department, often relying on the predictable formula and finding ways to switch it up, but it all comes down to: Here's our protagonist, they hail from a happy if not somewhat dysfunctional family, the parents are endangered (usually they're killed in some standard situation), and our hero/heroine must rise up, round up a band of misfits, have some kind of disagreement in the process, and save the day. The latest from the Disney Animated Canon, Raya and the Last Dragon, finds its loopholes but boils down to that.Once upon a time, in a thriving magical Southeast Asian land called Kumandra (which, from a distance, forms the shape of a dragon), four dragons used their remaining magic to create a gem that drives off evil spirits called the Druun. However, because of their sacrifice, they're all rendered to stone. Over the next 500 years, the people of Kumandra squabble over possession of the orb and the discord breaks them into five tribes: Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon and Tail.In the present, Heart Chief Benja guards the jewel, and trains his young daughter Raya to do the same. Benja believes that the other colonies can come together and reform Kumandra, but all anyone wants is the magic for their own selfish purposes. At a feast in attempt to harmonize, Raya befriends Naamari, daughter of Fang's chief, and, while bonding over their mutual love of dragons, Raya brings her new friend to see the gem. But Naamari, influenced by her mother's desires, deceives Raya and a fight for control breaks out, which shatters the orb and resummons the Druun, turning thousands - including Benja - to stone.Six years later, Raya has been out to find Sisu, said to be the gem's creator and the remaining of her kind, to restore the lost lives and peace to the land. Those aforementioned tropes form the rest of it. A lot of the film feels disjointed and the humor has a couple bright spots but I, who doesn't mind a bit of juvenile humor, wasn't all that invested with it. Raya's newfound friends have all but one character trait.It's our apparently flawless heroine that takes the cake. She's rarely singled out for her bad decisions and her Freudian excuse is trust issues. The different territories all have a fragment of the jewel and Raya travels to each place, picking up not only a friend for her journey but also a piece; Raya, despite knowing a problem is inevitable, carries what segments she has on her person. Think leaving the pieces with your dragon friend isn't good enough?And her newfound friends? They function on their sole character trait, which are all too familiar, even in a movie like this one. A young boy with cooking skills and some snark? Okay, sure. It's Disney, why complain? A giant scary-looking warrior with a heart? Typical. An infant con artist with simian-esque companions? You're reaching a little deep into fantasy there.Quality animation and talent aside, except perhaps Awkwafina, Sisu's voice, who spends at least half of her onscreen time going on anachronistic tirades, leading one to believe she may have been given the go-ahead to improv. The film's script is credited to television scribe Qui Nguyen and Crazy Rich Asians screenwriter Adele Lim, the latter of which may explain Awkwafina's dialogue. Overall, it's fine family fare but if you're digging for something with coherence and character development, it might be time to cancel your Disney+ subscription. 6/10.",Raya and the Last Dragon
251,akunwafor13,At least Disney tried.,6,6 March 2021,"Raya and the last dragon is refreshing, not because it's something you've never seen before, but with Disney's trend of remakes and sequels, it feels somewhat original.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The film is beautiful and portrays some absolutely stunning landscapes. However, praise for the film quickly runs out beyond that. The whole thing felt very formulaic and I couldn't escape this very video game feel of it all. The story progresses from one quest and treasure hunt to another, culminating in a boss fight, ultimately leading to the biggest boss fight of all toward the end. Also there were many attempts at humour that really just didn't land.Disney films used to have a major central theme that maybe wasn't as subtle as you would like but here they can't help but bash you over the head with it repeatedly - IT'S ABOUT TRUST.Really it's a perfectly fine effort that is a treat to look at, but it won't live long in the memory.",Raya and the Last Dragon

While the voice acting is great, the script struggles to balance the world building, characters and plot all within the run time.

263,azeezsmith-61542,Raya And the Last Dragon Review- An Instant DISNEY CLASSIC,10,9 October 2021,"Raya And The Last Dragon is filled with top notch fighting, an adventure worth seeing, spunky characters and its BREATHTAKING ANIMATION. Kelly Marie Tran and Awkwafina made me laugh hard in this and the perfect Disney duo that I just adored through this film. Raya And The Last Dragon pumped me up with lots of laughs and the story and way they handled the Asian culture and food is genious. Congrats to Kelly Marie Tran being the new Disney Asian Princess. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Raya And The Last Dragon is just a breathing taking movie to enjoy with your family. I blame Awkwafina 100%for laughing me up soo hard and this is the most incredible animation Disney movie that I enjoyed out of soo many other Disney movies. Raya And The Last Dragon made my list of 2021 and I loved the music called Lead The Way is out now for you to listen and This Disney Animation movie just really and proudly proves how much I love Disney throughout my life and to see it all be soo Gorgeous and beautiful even now. Raya And The Last Dragon is a must watch on Disney+",Raya and the Last Dragon
264,dr-cornelius-119-743806,There are better Disney films,8,13 June 2021,"I think that we are a bit spoiled after receiving Frozen, Brave and Moana. It think Raya and the last dragon was a bit hasty. I love the concept but something was off. It was also a bit strange having the dragons talk, I think It would be better if they were mute.I enjoyed it, and would love the see a follow up, but it wasn't as good as some other Disney.",Raya and the Last Dragon
265,samog-98289,Best Disney Princess movie since Mulan and not the rubbish remake from last year,7,21 May 2021,"There are some similar story elements from Avatar: The Last Airbender which I think is better than this movie. Anyway, it's nice to see Kelly Marie in a Disney movie outside of Star Wars this is her second animated movie after The Croods 2: A New Age, Benedict Wong is a cool addition to the cast, Alan Tudyk has done so many animated movies now and Awkwafina has another movie coming out this year called; Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Overall I can't recommend this enough.",Raya and the Last Dragon
266,cjenkinson-66190,Outstanding!!,10,11 March 2021,"Just loved this movie, an absolute must see! Beautifully illustrated and a really beautiful story! One of my fave Disney's movies for a little while.. gorgeous!!",Raya and the Last Dragon
267,moov_e_c_er,Don't believe bad reviews,9,8 April 2021,"Animation was great except the dragon looks more like a unicorn/horse and odd colors. Love the voices. Story overall fair and sometimes cheesy. I laughed out loud a few times. Some movement symbols looked like some respect to ""Moana"". Love it was Asian actors of well regard. Good music choices. Watch with the kids of course.",Raya and the Last Dragon
268,anuraagti,Won me over,10,16 June 2021,"Maybe it's just the fact that this comes in the middle of the covid pandemic (for most of us, with just a few countries where things are returning to normal), but Raya's naively optimistic message is somehow really welcome and not just Hollywood tinsel.I guess I mean the movie worked for me, despite all the bits about it that were just ridiculous, or too over the top politically correct / strident Hollywood. I actually spent about 45 minutes fighting the movie and really disliking it, but it totally got me somewhere along the way. Hence the 10/10, suspension of disbelief happened at about the midway mark.And it's got some seriously memorable characters and characterisations that are really arresting and imaginative. Visually lush, beautifully made technically, just a great visual spectacle. A mature sort of technical style that's nice to see on screen. The dragon's great as well, such a lovely character.So yeah. It's flawed, but it's got a heart, for this viewer at least, and is definitely something people should watch in the midst of the pandemic for its heartwarming optimism. Welcome indeed.",Raya and the Last Dragon
269,Avalala,1/10 seriously?,8,17 April 2021,"I'm sorry if you gave this movie a 1/10 you have a problem. No Disney animated feature is a 1/10. If this movie came out pre or post Covid-19 there would be zero bad reviews. Really good fun movie and story, seriously fantastic animation. Missed opportunity for the turnout it deserved in theaters but that doesn't change its value.",Raya and the Last Dragon
270,joostkale,Sometimes Disney just gets it right,8,8 March 2021,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought: 'Oh god not another generic Disney storyline'. To be fair, the movie does start of like that. The opening is very predictable and cliché. But then something happens. Disney starts actually caring about character development. Every single character gets a solid backstory and good reasoning for their actions. This makes the movie so compelling to watch. From the antagonist to the side characters, everything makes sense. Yeah, the story isn't the most original, but it all works really well. It does take a long time to set up the plot, but ones we get going, it never stops. Also, the movie is stunningly beautiful. All the different parts of the world have their own distinct feel and charm. I must admit, the first act is a bit of a drag, but after all, its one of the best Disney animated movies we've seen in a while.",Raya and the Last Dragon
271,energy_ucoz,Predictable,10,5 March 2021,"Very predictable, not very likeable characters. Except for Sisu and Raya. Also wanted some kind of plotwist. Visuals stunning. Big bonus for originality, atleast not live action remake. . But overall movie is not that bad to watch with ur family atleast once. I don't like musicals, but wanted like 2 good songs in it. There was good background music, but wanted some really good music, like in Muana.",Raya and the Last Dragon
272,rajitecture,Good Disney movie for a year that lacked new content.,8,7 March 2021,"The beginning could have been cut back 3-5 minutes to get it going. I also don't care for the treatment of the dragon. Besides all that, I think the story is good and it gets better as it goes on. Good Disney movie for a year that lacked new content.",Raya and the Last Dragon
273,ryanwesthamfan,Fun for the family yet still playing it safe Disney,8,12 March 2021,"Raya And The Last Dragon is the latest Disney Animated Classic. I enjoyed it.The voice cast is great. In particularly I enjoyed Awkwafina, I thought she had a really great performance. The one difference between this film compared to other modern Disney films is the lack of musical numbers. But this film like Wreck It Ralph is able to get away with it. My issue with this film is that it sticks too much to the Disney formula by playing it safe and not really adding anything new to the genre in a way that the film just feels all to familiar. I liked the landscape of the film and this sort of post apocalyptic world that we are shown. We also have some of the best action scenes we have seen in a Disney animated film. It is one of the more mature Disney films but still one to watch with the whole family.Overall I'm going to give ""Raya And The Last Dragon"" a 8/10.",Raya and the Last Dragon
274,runcap,Dragon voice was like scratching a school chalkboard with my teeth,4,17 May 2021,"That goofy Ellen DeGeneres voice worked for a fish but not for a Dragon.Raya seemed irritated by the smart-alecky Dragon,the Yin & Yang of angst Raya and goony Dragon just didn't mesh, it's was like watching two different movies, the sympathetic Raya was jarringly upstaged by a day glow, hyperactive Dragon with the attention span of Scrat Squirrel.The Dragon was more bearable when she turned human, I really enjoyed those short breaks before she turned back into My Little Dragon & Equestria Girls discover the magic blue bowling ball.Boring!.. sidekick characters were plucked from other Pixar movies, I just rolled my eyes and thought I might just nap my way through this plagiarized video game ,but the gorgeous visuals always sucked me back in...actually the movie could be turned into an Xbox One game$$$Also Raya's facial expressions were very well done, but the bad girl cage fighter/ tomboy seemed constipated.What's really disappointing ,the story and one or two characters had the makings of greatness.But it all was wasted .What was great, the theater had two hundred empty seats and only fifteen taken up by the post Covid audience ( online reservations only)...sweet!",Raya and the Last Dragon

277,pruz-55801,MUCH better then expected pleseantly surprised,7,14 March 2021,Raya and the last dragon is a great family film with beautiful visuals superb acting and a very good storyline that if it wasnt disney couldve been amazing let me clarify rhats not to say Disney makes bad movies its just that they make very FOTMULATIC movis but the system works if this was live a ction and free of the Disney formula it would have been amazing! Great world building and storylines and possible outcome. But that doesnt take away from the beauty if it the film is heartwarming and cute see it on disney plus its worth the $$ or go with the family or friends to theater for the first time in a year (at least in ny where i live)Overall i do nnit fell that this was a waste of time or a trashy film quite thw contrary go see it you'll enjoy it,Raya and the Last Dragon

279,a-clinch1,Standard routine fare,6,6 March 2021,"Kids will still enjoy the film due to the incredible animation. Tens and over may struggle as the story is a by the numbers unoriginal tale. Actors voices are well suited to the characters. I found the film to be relatively average, not particularly funny, no connection with the characters. A real shame, especially when the end scene was actually very good, but could have been so much more powerful if we had an emotional connection to the characters. A real shame as the animation and the disney name deserve much better.",Raya and the Last Dragon

281,sinahaase-960-743497,Disappointed but not regretful,6,5 March 2021,"I'm not sure why I was disappointed after watching this film. I couldn't wait to see it with my daughter at home and we just finished it, but for some reason I felt some unexplained disappointment. It here was no, ""WOW! That was amazing!.."" sort of thing once the credits rolled. I kinda felt like the ""Disney magic"" (even though there is clearly magic in this film) was missing? I'm not sure. I thought I wouldn't mind missing a bunch of musical numbers but I wasn't even impressed with the score either. It didn't feel ""Disney."" There was so much I still loved though about the film, just not enough to give it a 7-10 (which is my usual reviewing scale for movies I LOVE and have been captivated by etc. but with minor issues of my own opinion) but I couldn't give Raya that review. Maybe because I saw it at home? I'm really not sure what I'm missing because I honestly usually LOVE movies like this...full of magic, a badass protagonist, some crazy evil that gets defeated, and of course a lovely theme at the end that melts you a little...Raya had ALL of these! And yet still I felt it missed something of my own taste in the content. Maybe someone could let me know some ideas. I read the other reviews and maybe it is the plot/content that was lackluster in all. I will say this, I'm very excited to see the new Pixar movie set in Italy (I think) and I really hope it does not disappoint! I watched Raya twice before I made this review and I don't think I'll be coming back to edit it. I think that's it on my official opinion :/ thanks for reading :)

283,evrivali,You've seen it all before but for some reason you'll still enjoy this,8,7 March 2021,"When I first heard about this movie I wasn't very excited. The premise wasn't interesting enough for me and there was just something about it that made me go: ""nah"". Still I decided to give it a shot because it is a Disney movie after all and I was curious to see what they came up with this time. And I'm very glad I did. I went in with low expectations and negativity expecting the worst since I read a bunch of reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes it's the good ol Disney formula that we all know. Sometimes it's even laughable how much it felt like watching Moana again BUT apart from the cliche storyline the movie is amazing. It's more visualy pleasing than any other animation I have seen recently and the voice acting is flawless (how couldn't it be with such a wonderful cast involved). It delivers a nice message to the younger audience (yes Disney is great I'm an adult and I still get excited over Disney releases but the target audience is children and we should judge the movie based on that) and the action is decent enough to keep you pumped throughout its duration. Personally I was not bored at all. Not a big fan of the comedy but still pretty decent for a children's movie. All in all you'll have a fun time watching it and there's no doubt that we have a new addition to the Disney hall of fame here. I really hope it will come out in theaters when it's possible since I would really enjoy watching it again under different circumstances AND I'll make sure to never doubt Disney again since these guys rarely disappoint. Totally recommended!",Raya and the Last Dragon

289,passan-80670,"Good movie, awful ""humor""",5,7 March 2021,"This movie did many things right. The landscape, the story, the choreography, cinematography at points and the main character. I think I fell in love with Raya.The music is often times really good, but sometimes they use instruments or genres (like dubstep) that are really unfitting for this time period or region.Many sequences and character actions/thoughts do not make a lot of sense. Felt more like the script wanted to do them something. Lazy writing.The 3rd act makes barely any sense. I realize, that the makers wanted a happy end, but many sequences just happened without any real reason.What dragged this movie down was the terrible TERRIBLE ""humor"".
The tone of this move was great, until they introduced the dragon. Everyone but the ""bad"" guys is a joke dispenser. The ""jokes"" are not even funny.
The film makers often times even stopped the movie to make a ""funny"" thing.
This ruined the flow of the movie and since not a single thing was funny, it just wasted time.In the end, I still would recommend it, Just alone for the awesome animation.",Raya and the Last Dragon

293,corneliusroz,Best movie from Disney after Coco,10,12 March 2021,The story is very similar to Avatar the last Airbender. With that note i would say it has a beautiful ending and visuals were fantastic. Story was great had a well progression at first but i think before the ending something happened. Maybe the Disney studios messed with the original script or something but there was definitely twist and felt forced but there's definitely some elements here and there which awes you. The last fight scene the backstabbing friend being converted due to the power of trust and her amending her past mistakes was such a powerful scene brought me to tears. I'd watch it everyone should watch it. People who thinks this plot is repetitive while they still love submissive princesses who needs a man for her saving should just watch those instead of ranting over here in review section saying it's a bad film.,Raya and the Last Dragon

The premise is original, but the story is more of the same in Disney. Which is not exactly bad, but predictable and a bit boring.",Raya and the Last Dragon
295,Paradroid78,Don't pay for this!,6,5 March 2021,"6/10 because of amazing visuals, a great main character, and a good final act.The bad news is the rest of the movie tries to cram way too much in, and as a result moves along at such breakneck speed, that it sacrifices most character development and never lets the viewer get properly immersed in the various parts of its world.I honestly wonder if it was actually meant to be a mini-series. It jumps between adventures in lots of really elaborately detailed locations, just as it would if it were split into episodes. Because it's a movie though, it only ever spends about 5 minutes in each before travelling off to the next part of the world.The first act setting up the plot and characters is preposterously fast. Imagine if in Frozen the build up to Anna and Elsa's parents dying and Elsa being coronated queen happened in the space of 5 minutes.As the movie progresses, the titular main character (who is actually very good), assembles a rag tag little gang of people, but again because things are moving so quickly all the time, we spend so little time with any of them and they end up feeling like they were assembled from some archive of stock Disney sidekick characters.The movie is so rushed, that at one point towards the end, the plot jumped forward so quickly from planning a heist to meeting with an important character I was convinced it must be a dream sequence.And just when you think the middle act is getting properly going and an antagonist announces that she is hatching an evil plan to force Raya to give her something important, that is literally the last thing we ever hear her say. After that she is completely forgotten about while the movie jumps straight into its (admittedly very good) finale. It's like half an hour of movie is simply missing.I really wish this was twice the length that it is, as it would be totally awesome with more time spent just not rushing through the plot so quickly. Sadly unless there's a directors cut laying around somewhere with a ton of cut content, this is just too all over the place.To be fair, the ending is actually quite good and it's probably fair to say that the animation is Disney's best so far. It's really not a bad family movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's just a crying shame that the whole thing feels so rushed.I would say it's not worth paying the premium to see early on Disney Plus. Wait until it gets included in the normal subscription.",Raya and the Last Dragon

-Voiceovers by everyone fit in very well with the characters specially Awkwafina as sisu as her husky voice fits in so well.What's not so good about it?
-The ending is a typical affair with plenty of cliches.
-The duration was short resulting in a restricted environment where we could not see the depth and richness that's required to truly celebrate this world of cute dragons.In the end, I had plenty of fun watching Raya and her dragons in 3D at a movie hall so, go ahead and watch it right now.(Do check out @madovermoveez on insta to enjoy more reviews and content regarding cinema)",Raya and the Last Dragon

304,sebastianschlicht,Unfortunately a very trivial Disney epic with terrible humor!,2,22 August 2021,"""Raya and the Last Dragon"" was released in 2021 on the ""Disney +"" streaming platform with payment of the stupid VIP ticket, but is now available for free or as Blu-Ray and DVD.The new original Disney-film created great expectations for me, after all, the trailers looked quite impressive. And then there were very positive reviews. I was really looking forward to the film, I thought, ""Finally another great animated Disney- film, that isn´t a sequel or a remake!""
And even if ""Raya"" seems to be enjoyed by many others, it has disappointed me very much and that on many levels. The two directors Don Hall (""Baymax"") and Carlos López Estrada wanted to create an epic fantasy adventure with emotions and humor, just like in the old days, but in my eyes ""Raya"" suffers from the same problem that almost every Disney-movie suffers from (I'm excluding a lot of Marvel's MCU films here) since ""Moana"": discouragement!In the world of Kumandra, people have divided into several clans through years of quarrels and wars. Dragons once lived among the people, but the evil Druun-creatures petrified all remaining creatures. One of the clans has the last remain of these dragons and the only protection against the return of the Druun, a dragon stone. The young Raya protects this jewel with her father, but through a betrayal outside, the sacred relic is broken and a dark age dawns ...Unfortunately, in my opinion, ""Raya"" offers too much material for just one film. The whole thing would have worked so much better as a TV-show, because the world here is huge. There are also other positive aspects, such as the look. The animation is strong as always and above all the style and the design of the world is great (except for the dragons, they look to me like a mixture of Elsa and ""My little Pony"" ...). The colors are powerful and everything looks magical and impressive. But what Disney can no longer do with its classic animated films is to write good scripts. As I said, there is too much going on here for such a short run time of 107 minutes. And despite the many characters, events and locations, I was often just bored.Unfortunately, ""Raya"" fulfills so many typical clichés, and not just the Disney clichés. For example, two characters meet and become friends in the next scene without any structure. The motivations of the characters changing all the time and sometimes make no sense. I like that the film deals with the theme of trust, especially in these times, but then it should be implemented well and not shoved into our faces. And that's what it felt like sometimes. Sure, Disney wants to appeal to and entertain younger viewers, but kids aren't stupid either. You don't always have to tell them everything and explain every detail. But Disney is too scared that someone in the audience will suddenly ask, ""What's going on now?"" So, in the end extremely unimaginative dialogue emerge, which unfortunately rob the characters any humanity.The action is ok, but also relatively unspectacular, although the music by James Newton Howard is really great. The main theme stayed in my ear for a long time after the film was over. I'm looking forward to the soundtrack!My biggest problem with the movie is actually the humor. Rarely has misplaced humor annoyed me as much as in ""Raya"". The story takes place in a fantasy world and what do the characters do? They knock out modern references and adolescent jokes ... Especially the dragon Sisu annoyed the heck out of me with her forced, ""funny"" manner. ""Frozen 2"" already had the same problem and also ""Moana"", but here I was really shocked. Some of the jokes were actually solid, but most of the time I cringed of embarrassment. And so ""Raya"" becomes not a timeless story, but rather an unimaginative product of its time.Conclusion: In my opinion, Disney is in a qualitative crisis with its films! The countless remakes are becoming a joke anyway, but also the classic animation works slowly but surely suffer from a discouragement, which in the end results in trivial mass taste. I'm sure that hardly anyone will remember ""Raya"" in ten years' time. Disney is more concerned with keeping everything culturally accurate and detailed, but forgets a gripping story. For children an admittedly entertaining adventure, but for me the movie lacks real emotions and an identity. Money can be earned with it, but no recognition!",Raya and the Last Dragon

311,samuellickiss,"A fun, middle-of-the-road adventure",7,7 June 2021,"Southeast Asia and dragons is a pretty good hook for a film as far as I'm concerned, and Raya mostly delivers. Visually, the film is beautiful, even if the character models do look a little plastic against the lush environmental details. There are some striking 2D sequences that I really enjoyed, in a similar vein to Kung Fu Panda.The music is...good? I think? It's a bit odd. I ordinarily love James Newton Howard's scores, but this one goes all over the place. The use of traditional Southeast Asian instruments like the gamelan is there, but often buried deep in the score. Instead, there's liberal use of synth and an overall very digital sound, plus electric guitar in places. It's just quite strange and doesn't quite mesh together as a whole, even though there are some lovely pieces of orchestration.The story and writing is a cookie-cutter, revolving around the theme of trust and healing of deeply engrained divisions. It's certainly topical and relevant to the time. It's not subtle. There's a persistent problem in a lot of children's/family films that writers can't let their themes express themselves through their visuals and plot; instead, it needs spelling out. Children can infer these things without needing the sledgehammer. A cookie-clutter plot doesn't mean that it's bad, just it doesn't really add anything new or provide anything especially compelling.For me, the performances, while very good by any reasonable measurement, just weren't to my taste. Awkwafina as Sisu, especially, has an energetic goofiness in her performance that clashed with the idea that she's a wise dragon. It feels extremely American, rather than being rooted in Southeast Asian culture.Ultimately, I enjoyed Raya. I have no particular desire to watch it again any time soon and I am glad I waited for it to come onto general access to Disney+ rather than paying extra. It's been a little while since Disney Pixar released a really top tier film - the last one in my view was Coco (Soul was good, just a shame that the first Black-led Pixar film consigned the main character to being a cat for most of it; Onward was average, The Incredibles 2 disappointing, Toy Story 4 better than expected but still average). Disney seem to be concentrating on live-action remakes/prequels/sequels that I have no interest in. I think Raya could have benefited from being a traditional Disney musical rather than a Pixar-style film.Still, enjoyable.",Raya and the Last Dragon
312,MAGALUV,BORING ZZZZZZZZZZZ,1,8 March 2021,I was so bored watching this. The voice actors sounded all sounded like they were half asleep.

315,sweetcypress777,Beautiful animation and lasting story,8,7 June 2021,"This movie has wonderful visuals, strong and complex female and male characters, and excellent messages of cooperation, trust, and not to assume you know a person because of where they come from. It also has strong messages of the things people will do out of fear and the sometimes terrible consequences. Characters are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and opportunity to change and grow. It's quite beautiful. Also nobody's Mom or Dad dies so, kudos Disney! I loved Sifu the Dragon, her voice work was fantastic. All the voice work is very well done. I watched this two nights in a row, I did enjoy it that much. I think even with its flaws it will still become a childhood favorite, especially inspirational for girls. I love how the characters got to have their own opinions and personal responsibility. They got to have their own unique voice and make their own mistakes and choices including correcting mistakes.That said it's pretty obvious a lot of this movie was set up for video game and Merch sales (like the unnecessary final fight scenes and super cute fuzzy dragons) and that detracts quite a bit. I wish more Asian and East Asians had been involved in the directing and production. They also get around using specific southeast Asian character design by setting it in a fictional land. While this allows for a broad range of SEA design elements that are really neat and often beautiful, I wish they had an Asian composer to lend more cohesion and authenticity to the score. The movie goes with pretty generic ""tribal"" music. At least the characters are a variety of browns and facial features so that was cool to see. Try to look past the obvious cash grabs (bad Disney!) and the beauty of this movie shines through.",Raya and the Last Dragon
316,GBMpersonal,"Pixar's work with less emotions, except for the ending",6,21 May 2021,"I only felt fascinated with the animation during the fight scenes between Raya and Namaari, which are very well choreographed and worked on. There is still a lack of metaphors that this producer always brings, because this time they focused only on the idea of betrayal and forgiveness, with no scope for symbolism or other related issues. Comedy within a serious argument is something that bothers me, but I prefer more a joke to break the tension than the exaggerated cartoonist of the ""Mitchell Family"". Disney's standard elements, like good animals always being too cute, are tired.A very predictable work that is worth it just for the beautiful argument.",Raya and the Last Dragon

319,KaiOlaf,Maybe the best Disney movie of all times,10,31 May 2021,"First: What is going on about that many negative ratings?Of course nobody needs to share my following enthusiasm, but to make this movie that down as it happens here seems to be a campagne or something, because even if somebody don't give eight or more stars for this it never ever is THAT bad as you write.Now to my opinion that is quite the opposite:
I just saw this movie today, and even as a hugh Disney fan I am so flashed that I need to cool down for a few days before I call Raya and the last dragon the best Disney film of all times.The detailed storytelling and its message is that mindblowing that I can't remember if any animation film was ever close to that.Of course the animation and the humour is excellent as well, but it stands in the shadow of the great story. And it is okay and fits to the rest that there are no songs in this movie.A little part of me even hopes that this might be the first oscar for the best film for an animation movie.

Yes, it's a repetitive concept, ""Oh, the world was changed because everyone got greedy etc etc..."" but that's the point, kids are dumb, they don't understand the concept of what is better as much as we do. 8/10 not bad, would watch with my nephew again.",Raya and the Last Dragon

327,thecanadian-23317,"Better than the sum of its parts, but not without issue",7,21 June 2021,"I finally got around to seeing the movie, and overall I enjoyed it a lot. The animation work is obviously incredible, I really love the Asian aesthetic/design of the movie, and I really love the overall message that the movie sends. The biggest issues come from some of the story decisions though.I think that Raya is a good character - you know her goal from the beginning of the movie and that's what drives her. But most of the characters that end up joining her group end up feeling very one note. It felt like the writers just wanted to have a ""band of silly characters"", but didn't put in the time to really develop them. Also, I am not an Awkwafina fan at all and she plays a very prevalent character in the movie. The character that she played was good, but having to listen to Awkwafina for an hour and a half was a bit grating.The other story issue that I had dealt with the structure of the movie. Without getting into spoilers, the movie is largely split to into 5 different sections, but they weren't really equal. Some of the sections went a lot quicker than others, sometimes the characters had to work for their goals and other times they were just kind of handed to them, so it felt a little uneven.Overall though I really enjoyed the movie. It's a really fascinating world and it made me laugh quite a bit. It also has really gorgeous fight sequences. It's definitely worth at least one watch.",Raya and the Last Dragon
328,letande,Inspiring.,9,6 March 2021,"OK, I... loved it. And not only because I'm a huge fan of Disney Princess family. Even though yes, I am. But also because... I really, REALLY love Disney's vision. I mean, the guys are fighters. They have all of those dedicated people who believe in better world and try to make it possible by telling us all of those beautiful and incredibly inspiring stories. The stories that make us all open our hearts and become better. The stories that give us hope. And that's the thing about this movie. It's very, VERY inspiring. So far, it's the most deep and society-oriented movie of this kind and... it's a good thing. The way Raya and the Last Dragon depicts the broken imaginary world and makes us all feel like we can change our real one by trusting in each other and working together? Like I said, loved it.Also, animation, while being far from groundbreaking, is very solid, while the design is... kinda awesome, really, and would probably remind you of good old Studio Ghibli quite a lot. Seriously, it's pretty hard not to think of works like Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Laputa: Castle in the Sky and even Spirited Away here. Not in a bad way, of course, this movie is anything but a rip-off (Lion King anyone?) but that certain atmosphere is totally here at times. Even though our usual comedy reliefs from Disney are still here too and you'll totally get some laughs.What surprised me in a bad way, though, is a complete lack of songs. It's pretty hard to imagine this kind of a movie without those. And even though I can see why they did that, why they've decided not to add songs this time and focus on that certain Ghibli-like atmosphere, I still can't help but feel like something is... missing. Something very important. Especially in the long term. I mean, you don't re-watch your favorite movies every day, right? But those awesome songs help you to stay connected with your favorite scenes and characters all the time. Being refused to that is... kinda sad. Music does make everything better and I missed it here. A lot.Also, while overall writing is very good, some action parts don't make any sense. Like... at all. I won't spoil it to you but honestly, sometimes there's literally no logic here. And it's impossible not to notice. Not like this kind of entertainment is supposed to be logical and I actually hate it when people complain about logic a lot, but this time there's just no way to ignore that. Because really, it makes some parts to feel pretty stupid and you can't just say ""because dragons, that's why!"". Not like it ruins your experience with Raya completely, but... OK, I'm shutting up.Anyway, like I said, I loved the movie. It's charming, it's funny (Awkwafina does surprisingly good in Eddie Murphy's shoes) and it comes with a pretty strong impact. It's far from being what I was expecting (still hope we'll get another one of those perfect princess movies like Tangled and Moana one day), but it's absolutely great in its own way. The message here is so beautiful that it's hard not to feel anything. There are animated movies in this world that treat kids like bad parents. Like ""go watch some stuff, little brat, because I don't really care!"". And there are movies that treat kids as treasures. As people who'll be shaping our world in the future. You can easily guess which kind of a movie Raya and the Last Dragon is. And it's awesome.",Raya and the Last Dragon

To summarise, the movie looks amazing, and the story starts out okay, but then it just becomes a hodge-podge mish-mash of old stories from other movies, suspiciously similar to what a committee in a board-room would come up with.And therein lies the problem. It would have been a good movie but everything is so predictable and you feel like you have seen it all before, which, unfortunately is true.

Really beautiful movie.And maybe that is what made this movie so painful to watch. A boring cliched story, with the same beats over and over. It is even structured as different levels in a video game, with the different stages clearly stated from the beginning: Get a piece from each of the 5 kingdoms.And then watch the same fights, between the same characters, telling the same jokes (the 10th time that the beef jerky joke was told, I rolled my eyes in disbelief), with the same moral of the story repeated again and again at nauseam.None of the characters leaves a lasting impression, and nothing funny, amusing or exciting happens to them in their journey.Watching the trailers and the story premise I wasn't expecting much, but even with low expectations it managed to be a disappointment.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Ending was too fast, left with some unsolved problems.I understand the lesson about trust and believe, but the way they added in the story sound very reluctantly some times. And I particularly don't like the idea of trusting people blindly after they keep repeatedly done you wrong. But hey, she is the dragon, not human. So.....

346,spidermonkeycoleman,A predictable movie with a weak story and weaker characters,6,14 July 2021,"Note: Spoilers are in the 2nd and 5th paragraphsRaya and the Last Dragon starts off strong with an amazing opening prologue, but after that? Not really..The pacing was pretty bad, especially in the beginning. The prologue ends and then literally the next scene is Raya finding Sisu. We have no clue how she got there at all so it feels like you missed 10 minutes of the movie when it was just never in the movie to begin with. Certain key scenes felt way too short and unnecessary scenes take too long to end. The fights were way too short as well, except for the final fight/finale which I enjoyed.It's very predictable as well, even for a Disney movie. You always know where things are headed in a kids movie, but with RATLD, I knew every single story bit that was going to happen before it actually happened. That caused me to have no interest in seeing how things would play out because I already knew what would happen.The characters are mostly dull. Raya, Namaari, and Sisu are good, but other than that I didn't care about any of the other characters. This is mostly due to the fact that they have literally nothing interesting about then whatsoever except for cliche backstories.I also had a few issues with the story. They go through all the trouble of showing Sisu get her siblings' powers but never show her use them. Like they have 1 scene with her discovering the power then after that it's like the writers forgot to make her use them. A few things go unexplained as well, such as why at the end of the movie, Namaari's mother suddenly is fine with uniting the tribes once she sees the dragons.The world created in the movie is very cool. I loved seeing the different tribes and the background of the world's culture. However I do feel like the world building was drowned out by other elements in the film.Overall, there are a lot of Disney films I would choose over this one, and to be honest, I'm not sure how long I'll even be thinking about it after today.",Raya and the Last Dragon

363,mohammedalawami-10948,"A bit rushed but it's beautifully animated, funny and has great characters",8,6 March 2021,"So, finally, after 5 years, we get our first ever original computer animated movie and is it great? I'm happy to say yes. To start with the flaws, the movie did feel kind of rushed in some areas. Getting the gems was just a bit too easy at times and I wish those segments were stretched out to provide some more challenge. Same with the ending in a way. The movie told us in the beginning that Kumandra was split into 5 parts after disagreeing about the dragon gem so shouldn't it be one again, physcially and mentally? I do wish the movie showed us that.But, anyhow, let's get on with why this movie is amazing. First, the characters. Raya is a really enjoyable protagonist with a fun personality, a bad ass warrior, funny with a great voice performance from Kelly Marie Tran but also a flawed individual who understandably doesn't have trust in people due to a consequential past experience and grows eventually to trust her friend-turned enemy Namarri and speaking of Namarri, she's another great character with understandable motivations and I love that she's the one who is trusted to put the orb together, which ties in with the messgae brillantly. The other side characters are also pretty fun and funny with also their own motivations the baby got annoying at times. Awakfina as Sisu was surprisingly funny mostly and enjoyable and is the sense of optimisn in this world and her 'death' was pretty unexpected even if it was obvious she'd come back.There's also a huge sense of scale and consequences with this massive world of Kamundra that's creative, distinct, large and doesn't feel too similar to other works and there's actual consequences for people's action. All the fighting and lack of trust leads to consequences like the lack of dragons, characters not achieving what they want and the world crumbling apart and the story itself is a suitable adventure story. I don't get why people say it's a bad story. Disney has never ever been original with their ideas and it's an adventure movie. What did you expect? Do people forget animation is a genre? And I'm sorry but if you think Moana and movies like Indiana Jones have amazing stories but this doesn't, you're being hypocritical.And the fight choreography and action is simply remarkable, similar to the levels of Kung Fu Panda and even though the fights are similar, they feel spaced out so it does not become tiresome and we also get some fun Indiana Jones trotting adventure and chases.Comparable to Disney movies that came out last decade, this is definitely in the top half. Out of the 10 movies, it's probably 3rd or 4th behind Tangled and Zootopia and I'm still deciding if it's better than Wreck it Ralph. Overall, despite it being rushed in some areas, it's still a really well done Disney movie and I hope we get more original movies like this. Hopefully Encanto is as good.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The voice cast is outstanding and I don't understand all the hate for Awkwafina I thought she was terrific. The humous is wonderful, I laughed many times throughout the film and I loved the writing. The message of trust and forgiveness in this film comes across beautifully without feeling heavy handed and I loved the relationship between the characters.

369,ekimmichael,Great kinda new concept,7,5 July 2021,"Raya was fun to watch I would totally recommend to watch with the family. For the new generation being raised by Disney's classical this is the perfect story great storyline, screenplay you can really be satisfied with the plot from the beginning to the end. Not to mention the pseudo LGBTQ+ support implied between the 2 characters but i think kids would most likely to get the feminist message being served on a silver platter extracting themselves in that classical stereotype that woman need to be saved and ruled by man which is a great example of independence for young girl growing up.But I'm afraid it could be unoriginal for young adults( like me 23) or even more for the older generation but once again we're not the target audience but the story started out to be too predictable and ended up being more predictable, even know we can see some orignal ideas but I'm afraid it's a bit too technical( great animation) cause no one can argue it's a good story that exactly the problem it has everything a story needs to be good but that's just it, just good nothing to spark like Spider-Man into the verse world and others.Enjoyable fun to watch with kids.The Mitchells would totally take the Oscar for me next year...",Raya and the Last Dragon

The story of wanting peace, trust, love, growth and etc are universal. Learning opportunity to teach tolerance and to challenge assumptions. Right off the bat, as a native English speaker Raya is pronounced ""Riya"" or ""Reye-ah"" teaching my kid that letters mean different things or sound different depending on language and that we pronounce as people give us and not always what we see (phonetically or otherwise.)

376,samsmiler-91682,"It's no Moana, nor Frozen. And Disney, hello, soundtrack?! What happened?!",7,8 March 2021,"One of these times where the trailer is so much better than the movie. It's fun for kids to watch, lots of giggles and sometimes just the right amount of excitement, but it's not like Moana or Kung Fu Panda where both the kids and the parents could actually enjoy the movie.
This is a kids movie, and one that tries too hard to teach the importance of trust and cooperation.
Raya is beautifully done, Sisu with Aquafina's voice is fun, but the characters are flat and the entire story is most of the time either too obvious and flat, or too.
Also... SOUNDTRACK? Usually Disney wins big in this area and creates songs that really amplify the feelings the movie elicits, but in this case, I can't recall one song that accomplished that. Heck, I'm a 40 year old man and I laughed my ass of when Olaf in Frozen II was singing ""This will all make sense when I am older"". I felt the longing for the sea when Moana was singing about the line the light meets the sea. Does Raya even have a soundtrack? I can't remember.
Bring your kids to watch it, sure, but Disney can do so much better. Feels a bit like they were more worried about inadvertently offending someone or committing some culture mishaps than they cared about telling a good story.",Raya and the Last Dragon

There fantasy worlds are very similar.The only negative, or this could be a positive for you, is - the film is very female centric, with all the main characters and villains being female. However, unlike films like Mulan (2020) and Star Wars E7-9, Raya isn't some super invincible Mary Sue. Raya is a fantastic character and was a pleasure to watch on screen. I only mention this because I like to watch films that are more balanced between male and female characters.

381,jorge-30143,"This such a wonderfully delightful, visually stunning animated movie.",8,19 May 2021,"First of all, there are some really daft and rather silly people leaving the most ridiculous and incredibly delusional,
negative reviews. And they are (thankfully) only a relative minority group of people that, appear to be proud of
the fact that they've created a whole next category for themselves, ""The Negative One-Star Reviewers"".And these ""One-Star Reviewers"" are somehow under the false pretence that their opinions count. They don't.They actually have zero influence. But, even though these ""Negative One-Star Reviewers"" also appear to
have the loudest and most provocative voices - all over social media. However they do not represent either
the general public, or the real movie-going fans. Their aim is to desperately try to hijack anything or anyone
that, they deem to be culturally diverse and representative - far reaching and greater, Transglobal community.Furthermore....
The minority of people leaving one-star reviews of Raya and the Last Dragon, are most probably the same-said
people whom begrudgingly paid the £30 to watch Raya on Disney Plus's premium - where they would have had some ridiculously high expectations of what is effectively an animated PG-rated, family orientated movie.Raya and the Last Dragon is not specifically aimed at, adult audiences. But it most definitely reaches it's
target audiences which is families and very young children. But it is also a movie that can be universally liked
and enjoyed by one and all.For me....
Raya and the Last Dragon, is a visually stunning animated movie.And there are several thought-provoking, mindful moments, scattered all through this film fantasy.And I also enjoyed the film soundtrack. Plus there are some very good voice acting.There were also some well-choreographed martial arts, action set-pieces.And I really enjoyed the whole ancient mythical beings, dystopian, fantasy drama of it all.Raya and the Last Dragon is a solid 8/10 fantasy adventure.Message for all of the numptees leaving one-star reviews for Disney/Pixar/Sony/Netflix and Dreamworks -
animated movies. Nobody is actually taking either you or your one-star reviews seriously, ok.Even when 'Soul', 'Onwards', and 'Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse', that have received high praise and
fantastic reviews, and are now all deemed to be animated classics - even when these movies have
received some quite ridiculous comments - the general public are far more savvy, very wise and intelligent
enough to see through all of the petty and insignificant foolishness, of anyone that's felt compelled to
leave the most stupidly negative review.I've just bought the 4K Blu-ray version of Raya and the Last Dragon, and it does not disappoint.Watching it at home and in 4K, it just looks gloriously lush. This is far from being a very boring movie,
as some of these dimwits are claiming it out to be. Also there are some people whom just take
themselves far too seriously. And they will never ever get the whole point of the
animated/anime fantasy genre. Plus if you really didn't like a particular film or tv show -
then, you really do not need to constantly complain, whinge, moan about the reasons why.Especially when everyone is more than capable of judging a movie for themselves, ok.",Raya and the Last Dragon

386,solid-rock800,Not bad,6,21 June 2021,"I thought this was a decent movie. It's definitely not the best I've seen; I feel like the story seems a little bit just-so, like everything gets wrapped up with a nice little bow, probably in order to make it fit the format and a reasonable amount of time. It's not enough that it makes it a bad movie or anything, and I wonder if any kids would notice these little holes and dangling questions, but as an adult I definitely notice them. Also, it had some kind of cringey moments in it, and I wasn't a fan of the baby thing (I won't say much more than that to avoid spoilers).But that said, it's got a lot of good qualities too. The animation's nice to look at - I didn't care much for the dragon design from the trailer, but it was better than I expected when you watch the whole thing. I really liked the environments and cultural touches of the different tribes. The music is actually really quite good, minus the cliche initial end-credits song, but otherwise I just think the music is actually of a much higher calibre than the movie overall, haha. The story itself is pretty interesting, even if a little predictable, and has a really nice message to it. I got a little misty-eyed here and there (keeping in mind that I cry easily and was home sick when I watched it).So yeah, it's a decent movie overall. Not a bad choice to entertain yourself and/or your family with.Oh also, for the record, I *really* don't get the comparisons to Avatar: the Last Airbender or Legend of Korra. About the only thing they have in common is Asian inspiration for the aesthetics & world-building, and that a group is built up for their quest as the movie goes along.

It feels fresh and quite entertaining as well, despite being bogged down a few times. The characters are well constructed and you can sense a real conflict between them. With the gorgeous animation, the world it presents is really beautiful to look at. When it comes to action, and there are a few, I think it shines there as well. The sword fighting and hand to hand combats are impressive which kind of surprised me a bit, as I can't remember the last time when there's a sense of intensity in a fight sequence of a Disney animated movie. Well, the plot is nothing new. I mean, they've used every trope you could think of in the narrative, but that doesn't necessarily a bad thing if they're done right, and I think they've achieved just that quite efficiently. All around, it's a really good movie with enjoyable characters and appreciable coming from a studio that's immersed itself in taking the easiest route these days.

391,kemal-44877,Sad that I can't see it in theaters,4,12 March 2021,"The movie looks amazing, the quality of animation is mesmerizing with all the skins and shadows and camera depth and everything else. The animators tackled the hardships of putting this movie together with the pandemic going on and we have to thank them, producers, and all the cast and crew for that hard work. Having said that, the story... The one thing that kept me from investing in this story was Raya's decision to hide the dragon from the rest of the world. I get the fact that she doesn't trust anyone, but it is clear that if people knew about the dragon, they would be cooperative on the quest to save the world. The side characters learn about the dragon around the midpoint and it doesn't change anything in the story, even the main opponent stands mesmerized. So, the story team added an antagonist with the most illogical motivation and plan, which creates even more confusion. There is absolutely no reason for Raya to keep the dragon hidden. Also, they could have given the dragon a character arc by having the most cliche problem of her getting trapped in the human form. From there, Raya could try to convince people that this peculiar friend is the dragon, but no one would believe her, and so she would have to collect (steal) all the gems to show everyone that the dragon is back to save the world. Meanwhile, dragon, who was previously trapped in an alternate universe I guess, I didn't quite get that part, would learn to be selfless, as she wouldn't want to get trapped again, and with her selflessness and self-confidence, she'd not only save the world but also bring her family and friends back. By doing so, the theme of trust can be shown through the antagonist and deflectors, while persistence and selflessness would be shouldered by the protagonist and friends, making the story richer. On a final note, I'm sad that I can't watch this awesome animation in the theaters. The animation quality is really nice.",Raya and the Last Dragon

395,Tuefer_Benz,Otherwise Excellent Movie With A Serious Flaw,7,11 June 2021,"The final act of the movie is effectively an abuser enabler manifesto. The message of the movie seems to be that if a betrayer repeatedly lies and manipulates in order to hurt you and others (the whole world in this case) you need to redouble your trust - the very trust they rewarded with treachery - in order to set an example for them. That you should be so trusting and serene that even when they have a weapon aimed at your friend with their twitchy finger on the trigger you should do nothing, and if you act and your friend dies it is equally your fault - that is, it is not entirely their fault for causing the situation. Even after killing Sisu, Namaari did not accept full responsibility for her actions. Namaari did not even do what she should have done all along until Raya was dead (turned to stone) and presumably the whole world, including her mother, was dead and so she had nothing to lose.

What happened to the depth of your characters and the richness of your stories? This is the most haphazard ""princess"" movie ever made.

You can't piece together boring formulaic tv episode writing, stuff a ""theme"" of TRUST in there and expect the result to be ANYTHING other than dreadful.
I'd rather see a coming of age story about a spoiled princess living in a divided kingdom forced to save her people with the help of a just as helpless young dragon. It's cliche but at least it'd be watchable.
And WHAT WAS THAT supposedly ""emotional"" sacrifice of trust at the end where everybody just stood to the other side and turned into stone?

The fact that the relationship between Raya and her father is genuine and not just a 'you need to find a big strong man' plotline which adds extra to the story is amazing.I would say this would be better as an animated series rather than a film. Theres a lot of plot to fit into such a small space of time, such as exploring each of the lands and characrer interaction time. Everything seemed to happen in a blink of an eye which isn't a bad thing, I'd just personally love for more lands to be explored.Please don't let the negative comments fool you. These visuals are great and I really liked this film! It's a great film to sit down with the family and watch.",Raya and the Last Dragon

405,bin-carl,So much hate!😒🙄,10,28 March 2021,I see the trolls are out in force panning this movie. They must be trying to lower the score. It's typical Disney and if you went into this expecting something different then that's on you. But if you compare it to the stuff Disney usually puts out then you got what you came for. Great visuals & predictable story. But I would say better than the usual Disney fluff. Most families with children will definitely enjoy it. Maybe the critics were confused about what they were paying to see. I for one enjoyed it and so did the children I played it for.,Raya and the Last Dragon
406,bobbiwibble,Far better than the trailer,8,4 June 2021,"I wasn't bothered with the trailer - it didn't look like anything special despite the obvious excellent animation.Having watched it, I wouldn't say it would be worth premier access on Disney+ for me personally, but I'm on quite a tight budget. If you got the chance to see it at the cinema, I'm sure it was well worth it.But the trailers I saw didn't really show the degree of world building they'd bother doing, and I nearly left it for a night when I was very bored/ a bit drunk.Having watched it, I'm sad they didn't get a cinematic release here in the UK, because it would definitely have worked wonders for me on the big screen. As it was, refreshing a couple of times because of my slow laptop, it felt far too long, but it feels unfair to judge them on that. I would have paid to watch it twice at the cinema, but I don't think the enormous world they tried to show works for the small screen that well. So it doesn't hold up to rewatches as well as it otherwise might.My only real quibble is with the character development as Rayas big issue is with trust. It's also a big plot point but, while it's never shown, she is presumably happy sleeping near people she refuses to take food from. At least do the cliche of ""I keep the first watch"" or acknowledge that in this quite grounded film, ""it's not poison because I just ate it and didn't die immediately"" doesn't mean you haven't been poisoned. And if you think someone might hurt you, don't let them steer the ship without keeping an eye on them.I can see it working better as a series so they can allow for slower character development. I got the feeling scenes might have been cut.Checked to add: From the reviews here I'm getting the impression that the racial diversity was an issue? It has a fair few 1* reviews which is ridiculous because even if you didn't enjoy it or thought it was too formulaic that isn't a 1/10 problem especially considering the animation quality.",Raya and the Last Dragon

412,isabella-06097,"Worth the watch, but not perfect",6,13 August 2021,"I personally really enjoyed Raya. Was it a bit disheveled story wise? Yes. And was the humor bland at times? Yes. However it was better than a lot of the garbage Disney is throwing out left and right.For the positives - it's visually stunning, like really beautiful, I felt I could touch Sisu's fur. Gorgeous. I loved the design style for Raya, she was a piece of art to look at. I loved moral also, in this day and age, trust is important and very undervalued. The fact that you can sit and watch a movie about trust is powerful. Lastly I overall loved the way they solved everything in the end with Raya NOT actually putting the pieces together, thought that was since added bonus, and I'm always a sucker for the ""faceless"" bad guy idea, makes it all the more chilling in my opinion.The negatives - the constant trope that if a girl is a warrior, they must hate female clothing and inherently female things, no stop that. Also the pacing was problematic. Maybe if they had decided the world had split into Mind, Body and Soul not Fang, Heart, Talon and Spine, they wouldn't have had such a pacing problem. Often it seemed too easy and quick that they went through the different parts of the world, and I think had they cut it down, so there were 3 tribes, they would've had more time to explore the tribes individually. I don't know, maybe have Raya need to convince each tribe in a different way how to unite once more.Lastly, I kinda hate/love the whole ""everyone came back"" in the end, and this may be a personal preference, but I think it would've been more powerful if at least Sisu's siblings didn't return, and you kinda had more of a sacrificial scene, maybe resulting in Sisu realizing she has her sisters with her in each of the powers she carries with her from them. Again this might be a personal preference. Lastly how did the fathers leg magically get better the second he was no longer stone? He could at least limp over to Raya 😂All in all, a worth watch and all the people who are mad in the comment section, are mad cause they paid for the movie instead of waiting. Don't listen to them, way they and enjoy.",Raya and the Last Dragon
413,joshuarenealvarez,Raya and the Last Dragon (2021),8,24 March 2021,"Raya and the Last Dragon is a computer-animated action-adventure fantasy film which follows Raya,
the daughter of Chief Benja and the warrior princess of Kumandra's Heart Land. She has been in training to become the Guardian of the Dragon Gem, which has brought prosperity to the land for over 500 years. This came into fruition by the dragons of Kumandra who created the gem with their magic and sacrificed themselves to save the human race from the Druuns, evil spirits. When civilization finds itself in turmoil
once more, Raya seeks the aid of the last
remaining dragon to restore order. There was much to appreciate about this release whether it be the fascinating world-building or the interesting characters that belonged to the five different tribes, which were inspired from Southeastern Asian culture. The voice acting from the cast members was solid all-around. Especially from Golden Globe winner Awkwafina, who is one of the stand-out actresses working in the
film-industry today. She breathes life into the naive yet optimistic water dragon Sisu, who wishes to piece together the brokenness of the world through means
of unity as opposed to Raya who has become very cynical. Showcasing an amusing yin and yang relationship. My favorite character out of entire film has to be Captain Boun, a 10-year-old entrepreneur who accompanies them on their mission and delivers a great amount of comic-relief when onscreen. The action sequences embedded with
martial arts was nothing short of enthralling,
the animation headed by Amy Smeed and Malcon Pierce was visually alluring and the score composed by James Newton Howard was mesmerizing. This was another memorable experience that I've had
with a Disney film. It leaves the viewer with an heartfelt message about how we can make the world a better place by first learning how to trust and
connect with one another. Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez @theflowerhuman.",Raya and the Last Dragon

415,kariba_damn,Meh,7,23 June 2021,"Disney played this fairly safe, a kinda interesting story with average characters. This movie wasn't particularly fascinating but it wasn't bad either, it definitely had some great moments and ideas but they're not things you would remember for ages.",Raya and the Last Dragon
416,EdMatt13,Missed opportunity,6,6 June 2021,"Raya and the Last Dragon is the latest animated Disney movie, following Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) and her ragtag bunch of intrepid explorers as they seek to rid the world of an evil magic that turns people to stone.There is also, as you may have guessed, a dragon named Sisu, who, for all she is made out to be, does not actually do very much in this film.Raya and the Last Dragons plot is disappointingly cookie cutter, and some side characters sink to new comedic lows for the Disney brand, meaning that you can definitely foresee every event before it happens.The traditional 'go on a quest to get an object and then do something with the object' is not a bad plot line, shows such as Avatar The Last Airbender follow a similar narrative but turn it on its head and introduce new perspectives and ideas to the age old story.Raya and the underused dragon character fails to bring anything new to the story; none of the characters outside of Raya and Sisu are properly developed and it's moral viewpoint of 'trust' is dis-proven by so many characters that X Files' advice of 'trust no one' is looking more and more appealing the more I think about it; and it's message of greed bringing people apart feels very awkwardly written and doesn't come in with an air of subtlety. (Then again it is for children so that could've been intentional.)
The voice acting and casting however is near perfect; whilst I have admittedly not seen many Awkwafina movies outside of Jumanjii, I definitely think she was right for the role and puts her all into some pretty un-funny jokes.I'm glad to see Kelly Marie Tran get another shot after the disappointing way her character was sidelined in Star Wars, and she definitely brings an emotional and fierce voice to the character of Raya.The animation was touch and go, as a person who has had to animate water before now I have such respect for the animators who worked on the fluid effects for this movie as the water looks gorgeous.The rest of the animation was very cookie cutter standard for Disney and did not seem to improve or variate from previous movies as the characters looked very smooth and clay-like and didn't add many new techniques or styles into the mix. The paper sequence at the beginning was very well made however and I do not fault any animators who worked on this movie as everything looks very bright and well animated, if a little standard.Raya and underutilised blue talking toothless suffers from flat, underdeveloped characters, iffy dialogue and a very standard plot, however I am about ten years over it's target audience and if kids like it then it doesn't really matter what issues it may have.I recommend this film to families with young children, however this is far from a Disney best.Thanks for reading :)",Raya and the Last Dragon

419,a-73103,"I gave it a two for the visuals and awkwafina. Otherwise, I would have given it a 1",2,8 July 2021,"This movie seemed like a quick cash grab. None of the characters are original. The baby is a transfer student from boss baby, Raya is the most typical femme fatale character ever, the big gruff guy is like a dude from the ugly duckling, and so on. The whole idea of trust is very surface level. Also, doesn't it make sense for them not to trust people in this world? They literally get betrayed tons of times in the movie. Very formulaic, the gem splits in exactly 5 pieces and each tribe gets exactly one piece, they pick up a gang member in each tribe. They relied too heavily on the visuals and the fact that they had dragons and princesses.In all honesty, it wasn't a bad movie and didn't feel like a waste of my time, but my bar is so much higher than this movie in terms of Disney,",Raya and the Last Dragon

Sure the story has a common formula, that doesn't make it a bad film. It's simply gorgeous to look at. Kelly Marie Tran is wonderful as Raya. The supporting cast are great. I didn't like the dragon, at times it felt very JaJa Binks and when Awkwafina toned it down the dragon made a more likeable character.

A cataclysm befalls a county, warring factions and one plucky teenager has to fix everything as she assembles a ragtag band of characters from each region that becomes a family. The lead makes most of the mistakes, and so has to fix things, but needs everyones help to do so.

Though I won't call it the most creative storyline, but it is very well presented and runs at a decent pace. Characterization is very strong. I was initially surprised at the number of negative reviews for such a beautiful movie, but then I understand where some of the negative reviews are coming from. Most of the people who have followed GOT won't like the dragon presented here. I myself being a bit GOT fan initially didn't like the dragon. Dragons in GOT are strong and fierce which we have come to expect of dragons since. Seeing a dragon here which is meant to be beautiful and magical requires some unlearning. But it's their story and they can present their dragon as they want to and it fits the story and the message perfectly.

427,LunaLevina,"Enjoyable, but there are many flaws",6,6 March 2021,"I won't say it's a bad movie, I enjoyed it to watch it one time. But it lacks the former Disney magic to keep rewatching it.What bothered me the most is that this is almost a feminist movie. I am a woman and I support more female roles, but this movie... there are three male characters who play a small role. All the main characters are female and it irritated me how obvious that was. I also thought that Raya is almost the same character as Moana. I see too many resembles on how she acts. I liked the dragon, she was fun. The con-baby was funny for a moment, but in the end I didn't like it at all. The scary man looks and acts familiar (Tangled?)The story itself lacks the Disney magic. They try to be original, but the plottwist in the end is not very... wow. I didn't hate it, but it's not thought out very well. It has potential, but I had so many questions at the end.The animation is pretty good though. I can say the landscapes are beautiful.The music is fine, but it doesn't have a tune that will stick with you.",Raya and the Last Dragon

431,bcaffoe,A solid double hit,6,5 June 2021,"I read through a few reviews on this after watching this last night to see what others got from this and where the average rating lands. I think I agree with what I've seen, for the most part.Raya is a mixed bag. Some reviews have called this movie a bland, cookie-cutter Disney film that has lost potential. I would agree with the missed potential, but I also would contend that maybe a little cookie-cutter, classic Disney is needed right now.I hate to go into this on this platform, but it is relevant. Everything is so politically didactic in nature now. Disney has wholly jumped onto that train. In almost every one of their new works, you find some kind of socio-political nod, reference, or moment, and they aren't even subtle. They're quite on-the-nose. This film doesn't have anything overt of that nature. Either that or I missed it, but it's refreshing.Also, from a socio-political perspective, I believe Raya actually had a strong word to the spirit of the age, and this gets into the film's theme: Trust.I read a review that said the theme was greed. I agree greed is applicable here, but the film is more about trust, specifically rebuilding trust after betrayal.In Raya, we are introduced to a world that is fractured by covetousness, greed, and divisiveness. There are five nations that all covet the perceived prosperity of others and fight each other to get it.The opening of the film actually nails this theme. We meet Raya, her Father, and we hear his teaching on creating unity by learning to trust and taking the first step. He invites other nations to their home in an effort to show hospitality and show trust.Unfortunately, Raya is betrayed, the Drune is released, the dragon stone is broken, he dies, and the world is thrown into deep darkness. The rest of the film is about Raya's journey to get what she lost back, and along the way, she learns to trust others. She accumulated a crew of people from every nation. They all learn to trust one another and work together to save their world and everyone else.The finale is actually quite moving. Raya suffers loss twice because of Namaari, they fight, and finally Raya learns her father's lesson, to take the first step to build trust. Every character in the group follows suit, giving their piece of the gem to another. Finally, Namaari holds all the pieces and is confronted with a choice: to choose greed or sacrifice, giving both her and Raya solid arcs.This film's biggest strength is right here. I also agree that the film is visually captivating, and I also agree the film has defined weaknesses.Sisu was more goofy than majestic. The filmmakers never explained why Sisu received the gem from her siblings other than ""trust"", which actually put her out of joint with the rest of the story. In the end, Sisu is just comedic relief, which makes sense since they cast a stand-up comic for the role. It just didn't do it for me.The number of characters is also a weakness. The film is so busy taking you places and introducing people it forgets to let them have conversations. What is missed is opportunities for character development.All-in-all, I would call this a solid double.",Raya and the Last Dragon

433,chocoer,What a mess,2,11 March 2021,"Raya and the Last Dragon is a structural disaster. Thematic, character, world building, visual, and sound are all underdeveloped.The central theme of this movie is actually disturbing when you look at the whole. Clearly this movie was pushing the 'middle kingdom' narrative to satisfy certain markets, and that's... worrying. The moral messaging may be aimed at different markets, but the holes that they leave are just a mess, and not proper for all children.The characters are paper thin. Too many thrown in because they needed to satisfy a (attempted) humorous scene, rather than for story. The world developed falls apart under any kind of scrutiny, especially the placement of the characters and dragons within the world. The dragons are useless from a story perspective, they are just there for a 'cute animal' and not for any element of story. Everything 'accomplished' by them could be more clearly expressed if they were not in the film at all.The visuals are pump and dump Disney CGI. 'Villains' that look like placeholder CGI and texture packets that are low grade for the surrounding shot. There are some cute little tribute framings that are fun, but they don't live up to their source material.The audio is white noise. Hyper generic soundtrack, boring sampling, poor mix in portions of film.Very clearly Disney wanted SOMETHING coming out. They knew they weren't going to get theater take, so they wanted to use this to get some hype for their streaming service. I can't even recommend this for that.",Raya and the Last Dragon
434,ez_magdales,TRUST THE MASQUERADE,8,10 March 2021,"To be honest, I have been waiting for the movie to release since last year 'cause it was labelled with the genre of musical. Classic Disney movies with a lot of singing in it was where I was raised with but the movie didn't dissapoint me. The movie has a really good moral and reflection that kids these days should watch to. It's about: never lose a faith to someone that has betrayed you a lot. The story has a message about: to attain peace and unity, everyone should trust each other. The animation is so good! A beautiful character development between Raya and Namaari. Awkwafina rocks in this movie! she plays the funniest character. In conclusion, even though it's not musical, it still is a powerful and meaningful film.

I found the writers did a great job with character development and the zany, lovable dragon, Sisu, (played by Awkwafina) stands out above them all.

I still don't believe that this script was written by a human, I'm pretty sure it was AI generated: analyze a few movies like The Avengers and Avatar the last Air bender, add some buzzwords like Unity and Trust into the formula and voilà! You got this mess of a cartoon that costs 30 dollars.
The characters are completely one dimensional. The moral of the story is bad and unrealistic, why should anyone trust people blindly, especially their enemy who has betrayed them multiple times and wanted to do so again if it wasn't for that shooting mistake. The ending scene where they put gem pieces together and turn into stone was super cringy, there was no need for them to turn into stone (they could have connected the pieces at the same time together) so these shows that this was only added for fake sentimental values. I wanted to punch myself anytime that the repetitive jack fruit jerky joke was repeated over and over again, the characters try so hard to be funny, but they fall flat. Raya never faces any problems collecting the gems, she just enters each city and collects them with minimal issues, anything bad that happens gets fixed randomly, and we never get to know about each city very well, it's just a pass, get stuff and go. The origin of the Druum isn't clear, again they are made by a bunch of buzzwords and never attack the protagonists when they don't have any resources ready. Lazy writing. Also, no good soundtrack to sing along to. This one was a mess, do yourself a favor and watch Moana again, it was far better than this one.",Raya and the Last Dragon

It's sad that so much time and money was poured into this. Truly, the dialogue was cliche and trite from beginning to end. With all of Disney's resources, couldn't they have found a decent script?If an aspiring screenwriter had written this it would have been rejected hard.The dragon character is sillier and and more annoying than Jar Jar Binks.This movie reminds me of a really poor sequel that wasn't good enough for theaters so it goes straight to video and ends up in the bargain bin at walmart 2 months later.So tedious...will this movie ever end?I wish I had donated the $30 to charity and saved two hours of my life.In fairness, the digital animation was good, so the stars are for that.",Raya and the Last Dragon

But they could also have really used some chances to shine as heroes.The antagonist could also have used some more time in fleshing out their motivation (perfectionist Asian parenting, perhaps?).And while the world threat was incredibly menacing - instilling the most despair I've felt from a Disney movie in a long while - it was somewhat squandered at the end by some rushed art choices.Nevertheless, a solid delivery which could have been longer, and creepier.",Raya and the Last Dragon

I just wished I saw more effort like this from Disney. Couple of flaws aside, mainly on how the movie isn't afraid to beat you in the head with how important trust is and some typical Disney cliches, I'd say this is one of Disney's better movies in quite a while. I recommend this. Just wait for when you don't have to spend 30 bucks on it first.",Raya and the Last Dragon

It reminded me of Hayao Miyazaki films because instead of traditional villains it explained the various positions on the conflict. Top notch animation and an entertaining journey from start to finish. The people writing bad reviews probably didn't even watch it yet because it just came out today. Go see this on the big screen if you can! And wear a mask :),Raya and the Last Dragon
449,HanziTM,A sense of adventure and keeness to life,10,8 March 2021,"This movie looks beautiful and captures the immensity of the South-East Asian plethora of background. The movie is also immensely funny (especially with Awkwafina). Anyone who gave a bad review are obviously not viewing this as a Disney movie.The movie gives a sense of adventure, distortion and chaos. It gets you feeling the ups and lows. However, there are some logical issues with the movie so that it would work for the plot, but it is still overall a very solid movie. Kids will enjoy this immensely and adults' as well. Plus, how can you hate Tuk Tuk, he's just so cute",Raya and the Last Dragon
450,biggyofmt,Entertaining comedy with surprising heart.,8,14 March 2021,"Let's get the negatives out of the way first. It's fair to say that it's a fairly rehashed plot line. Gather the magic mcguffins and save the kingdom. Meet a zany cast of side characters who seem to be antagonists for five minutes.In spite of this, the movie rang true for me. Yhe scenery and animation is truly stunning. Cesu being played as a comedic character was unexpected and delightful.Raya works best sticking to the comedic side. It's clearly being played as an action-comedy in the vein if a Jackie Chan movie. The comedy did hit for me, but as with any comedy if the jokes fall flat, it might be rough.At the end though, the movie isn't afraid to make an emotional impact, even if the message has been seen before. The victory is won by character growth rather than magic stones saving the day.The movie does a lot of borrowing.The Druun are clearly inspired by the Mimics from Edge of Tomorrow.

I don't mind the theme and all but it's very easily confused with any other Disney movies, and not a good one either. The visuals effects were all beautiful, except for ....the Dragons. I really did not like the look they have chosen for the dragons in this one. I admit dragons are mythical creature so pretty much any interpretation are up to your imagination, however in the movie, they look like ponies or unicorns, not majestic or magical.

Her coming back kind undermines the final act but I love her and it's a Disney film. Had a very earned ending also. Characters were really strong had very believable motives and extremely likeable. Plot was very good like I said moana vibes. However I did pick up on a couple plot holes: she says don't trust anyone but trusts 3 people. Also if it's 6 years and that baby was born 6 years ago how come it looks like 1 years old.

476,kevinandrewsphoto,Disney is afraid to have villains anymore,7,6 March 2021,"Frozen 2 had no villains, just 2 groups that bonded in the end. Moana had no Villain, the lava monster was actually the mother island the whole time, it was Maui's greed that turned her. And Maui found redemption as well. And now Raya. You have a clan of people that selfishly backstab Raya and her father which results in the world ending. And yet they get redemption too?
I'm getting really tired of Disney being afraid to have true villains anymore. It feels very preachy that all of their films have a similar climax in that the villain the whole time was human greed, or not trusting one another.
Because as a viewer, it's very unsatisfying.
Animation and art direction was brilliant. The set pieces of the 5 different lands was breathtaking. But the writing left a lot to be desired.",Raya and the Last Dragon

That was not the case. Raya delivered on the Disney promise of enough entertainment to keep an adult guessing, and just enough magic to hold the attention of my 3 year old. BEAUTIFUL movie. Fun writing, great voice work (maybe a little over play Wong) but overall definitely a great edition to the universe that is Disney.

482,martletmoonlight,Nice visuals and mixed messages,6,1 May 2021,"I like that with this movie Disney continue to give us examples of strong women solving their problems without men coming to save them. This should be empowering to the little girls. I like that they made Namaari like this masculine strong warrior woman to bring the message that it's okay not to be a feminine woman. We as society definitely need more of this. The movie is very beautiful visually. I think the idea about power and equality is portrayed in a very interesting way. The people who struggled to get power and raise above the others only brought destruction and the people who wanted to bring equality brought more peaceful living to the picture. Sisu was very fun and interesting character.On the other hand the story as a whole wasn't very captivating. I didn't like the side story with the con-child. It's a bit over the top. They should've just made the joke with the kid and then continue the movie, not to bring the child with the rest of the characters and give it the characteristics of a grown-up. It's a bit too much. Also I'm not sure what was the idea behind the message to trust a person who's already wronged you twice with big consequences . Maybe that we should all be like Sisu - ""Hopeful""",Raya and the Last Dragon

They are magical, creative, their animation at best and jolly conversations. I kind of love everything about Disney, but in case of Raya and the Last Dragon there is something missing. A bit of creativity I think or a lack of good story - maybe. But I really do not feel like I used to feel after watching every Disney movie. Recently, I watched Soul and I was seriously moved. But not with that movie. I think Disney will figure out what was that.By the way, the voice cast is hilarious.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Is just beautiful to see, and you can see that people who made it had great ideas on where to take it. But the passing... Oh my, the passing. This movie doesn't stop to catch a breath. I can almost imagine this originally being a 2h30min movie and then a Disney executive came and was like: Na'ah, kids ain't gonna watch it. So they had to butcher it into just 1h40. I believe if you took the time to get to know the characters could have been a classic. Besides, It does seem a bit rushed in the editing.",Raya and the Last Dragon
487,luisafrugoli,"Enjoyable, But Wasted Potential",5,1 May 2021,"It's a enjoyable movie and I will not say that I got bored looking at it. The visuals are astoundingly well-done and the facial animation is so smooth, the fight scenes are very well-done. But there is a fundamental problem here: it doesn't seem to have a focus. It's too many characters squished into one plot and we don't have time to actually see who they are as people - it is ESPECIALLY jarring with Namaari's character since she plays such important role in the story and yet we barely see her inner conflicts.There is a climatic scene that is very useless aswell, since it gets solved very easily by the ending. I won't spoil it, of course, but it looked like it existed only to add to the fight scenes at the ending and not because it would make sense for the plot.Also the issue with Sisu's design... she looks too much like a plushie to actually resemble a dragon. She is kinda asian dragon shaped but that's all she has going for her. And she also acts very naïve-ish for a deity.I find the message of forgiveness poorly done to! Raya needs to trust someone who utterly traumatized her, and it wasn't done in such way as to even give said person enough screentime to show regret. There is no apology! Not even one!I am very interested in this movie for it's worldbuilding and it's potential in characters. Not for the actual final product. And I think that's the problem.",Raya and the Last Dragon

491,shawnman-56268,"Great world building, bad scriptwriting",6,5 June 2021,"The plot of Raya and the Last Dragon progressed far too quickly. There was a lot of potential with the beautiful, albeit avatar-esque, world that was built quickly yet thoroughly. The story, however, was just a predictable and rushed race through the world to gather MacGuffins in order to make a bigger MacGuffin to drive some vague narrative about trust and greed. This story was accompanied by a cringy, clichéd dialogue that made Raya and the Last Dragon a disappointment that was only saved by the incredible world building.My biggest gripes with the story are 1. The lack of logic behind Talon's motivations (""hey, let's steal the important items that will save the world and do it ourselves, they'll respect us after that"") and 2. As far as I could tell, there was no reason the dragons all basically died to save the world the first time, but there were no sacrifices the second time despite the method being the same. This lack of self-sacrifice made for a lazy script that discounted much of the danger the movie.But at least the world building was great!",Raya and the Last Dragon

Beautiful movie.,8,29 March 2021,"We get a lot of moralizing in animated films and thats not a bad thing, but they often csn seem all too repetitive of the same messages and ideas. Raya had to overcome this challenge and I think it succeeded.The animation is absolutely gorgeous and the voice acting is very strong. Kelly Marie Tran killed it and Akwafina was PITCH perfect for Sisu. Very memorable characters and this probably has some of the best action sequences since Kung Fu Pa da. The world building is there though it suffers a bit from the shorter runtime.The message is great and done poignantly. The films villain Nammari was very nuanced and played very well. There are pacing issues but the movie has more than enough quality content and story to overcome that drawback. Again the animation here is incredible and sets in my opinion a new standard. The music is also beautiful.There is a LOT to like here and its a shame COVID-19 crippled this films release, but I'm glad we got it. Well worth a watch.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Due to lack of character layering, I did not get attached to the cast. By far, the antagonist has the most interesting personality, but the other ones, including the main character, weren't that memorable. Also, what loses me is when they made the ending scene really emotional but really, at a scene like that, I would have cried. But no. I did not feel anything because as I said, the creators did not give you an opportunity to make the characters grow on you enough for emotional attachment.

But there are a few flaws : the characters don't have an ideal amount of room to grow and by the small synopsis on various websites ,I got the impresion that Rayas journey was about finding Sisu, not about finding the gem pieces ( I know /that is not really about the film, rather about the advertisement ) .

The animations, while bearing the Disney style, are amazing and the coloring is stunning.The story on the other hand is rather flat and predictable. It was little surprise that all the female characters in the movie are strong, while all the males are either dumb, violent, young or soft and naive. I would have loved a movie where a strong and intelligent girl teams up with a strong and intelligent boy to save the world. After all I have both a daughter and a son, and I raise them both as self confident individuals with role models to look up to.Like other reviewers, I too agree that the movie had a great feel to it before the dragon opened it's mouth.

511,girsoul,A simple story from the surface,8,9 March 2021,"An entertaining movie that is family friendly and thought provoking. An oriental inspired world full of connections to individual personalities and national pride. This film isn't going to make most people cry through direct consequence. However, this type of entertainment shows what we are missing in a modem world where we distance ourselves out of fear and mistrust. We're not all that different from our neighbor. Raya and the Last Dragon does make you think, and though there are political ideals, the underlining themes of trust, humility and humanity run deep through this story.",Raya and the Last Dragon
512,Honu-86,Visually and emotionally stunning,8,1 July 2021,"The only reason I didn't give this film a 10/10 is because of a few, rather minor technicalities and elements that drew initial critique during my viewing of the film; certain pieces of dialogue felt a bit 'too' modern and there were a couple of plot-holes. However, this was, overall, an excellent movie.The animation is amazing: the backgrounds are colorful and vibrant, textures like hair and fur are realistic, and the facial expressions feel genuine. The atmosphere of this fantastical world is, dare I say, magical and the inspirational elements from Asian countries are apparent and refreshing in their diversity. The story is a bit wanting, hence my rating, leaving a few questions to be asked, but I went into this movie knowing what it is. It's a Disney movie aimed at children. It's not meant to illicit critical and abstract thinking. The plot is easy to follow in that respect, but it also contains elements that are rather profound, like finding trust in those one would otherwise be suspicious of; looking under the skin, so to speak.I will say, the ending was pretty emotional for me and, while the overall story could be argued as predictable and clichéd, it remained consistent without jumping all over the place. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",Raya and the Last Dragon

518,martinwlicht,Beautiful Fairy Tale - and I'd like to see them as a Mortal Kombat DLC,9,31 July 2021,"117 minutes of a fantasy fairy tale with beautiful animation and action scenes, I enjoyed that movie.The setting draws inspiration from a vaguely South East Asian medieval setting, just like Frozen was obviously inspired by ancient Scandinavia. Of course, inspiration does not mean faithful representation, it's just a fantasy setting.The story follows patterns of computer games and animes. A lone adventurer tries to save the world, travels to assemble a party and collect magic items, and faces the ancient evil at the very end. The story isn't entirely predictable and has a few small surprises. The dynamic between the mistrusting Raya and the naively optimistic Sisu is fun to watch.The overarching topics of this movie are trust and mistrust. The story portrays the fallacies of naive trust in a deceitful world and the corrosive damage of universal mistrust to the whole of society; it's refreshing to see a Disney movie make such a balance. On a broader scope, the movie is a child-friendly parabola about the dangers of global hostility and the threat of nuclear annihilation.For a Disney movie, the fight scenes are quite fierce, though no blood is ever shown. It reminds me of Mortal Kombat. In fact, I'd like to see Raya and Namaari as a downloadable characters in the next Mortal Kombat. It must be fun to have them thrash each other.",Raya and the Last Dragon
519,unwhiskyetaulit,Lacks too much of what makes a good Disney,5,11 June 2021,"As a first introduction, I watched this now that it's included in the Diensye+ ""standard"" subscription. I don't agree with that ""premium access"" politics but that's another debate...So, what could we say about Raya....Disappointing is the first word.The story falls flat and after 20 minutes, you could tell what'll hapen next, how the story will unfold...
As for the story telling, this is more a succession of scenes rather than a story flowing from plot A to resolution Z.The characters are merely defined thus, you feel no connexion wiith them...Even the drawings and design are unequal.At one point, you have beautiful landscape and then you have poorly characters design...And the dragons...really pitiful.In their dragon form, they should look majestuous, that's how we usually represent dragons (think of Smaug or Draco from Dragonheart or even Maleficent).Here, the dragons are just a ""My little pony"" version. Just as ridiculous.I gave it a 5 because the ending is a bit better than 3/4 of the film, with real tension and some pretty good scenes.At first, this had to be shown in theaters but the COVID pandemy showed its nose and so Disney Co decided to put this on their Disney+ streaming service with a premium access....
But let's be honest, in othet times, this would have rather deserved a ""direct-to-video"" fate.",Raya and the Last Dragon

I mean they couldn't even bother changing the art style. The story is dumb and I've heard it a million times. The 'characters' are bland and I've seen them all a million times over. The only thing good about the movie was the humor. But even then I only laughed 1-2 times. 5/10 Luca is a better movie. Watch that instead.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Yea I know a Disney movie that feels like a Disney movie, shocked! But its a case of what my expectations were to what it became I guess I wanted to see something a little more but I really could not stand Sisu the dragon. Not a fan. The movie was doing fine until it got to that part. Also the story has that typical cliché message and cliché storytelling, its nothing too special but still does have those emotional moments that Disney tends to bring. But while I seem negative its still a lot of fun, plus its for kids, so I cannot complain too much, the other characters are all good the acting is superb and I am invested in most of the character. As a Disney movie its good though. After all of the horrible live action remakes at least this is something that attempts to be new and I kind of appreciate it.",Raya and the Last Dragon

I could definitely feel that the pacing is fast, but that only meant that every bit of the movie was really enticing and I was not bored for a single moment. The visuals are gorgeous. The score is also REALLY beautiful and enhances the experience. The best thing about this movie for me was the satisfaction the ending brings.I really liked Sisu's personality. I didn't really have a problem with the modern jokes they used in the movie. The moral of the story is amazing (one of the best morals I have ever seen in a movie, and is relevant to the real world). There were some parts that were unnecessary, but they didn't really drop the experience. Representation was a bit questionable, as they didn't directly represent Southeast Asia, but it was refreshing seeing a part of my culture in this movie (I am Southeast Asian).Great movie. Totally worth watching.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The actors performed wonderfully. The plot was okay for the initial viewing, but will be bad for subsequent viewings.While going for the comedic appeal for mainstream attention, Raya fails to build empathy and connection for the characters we spent time with. The characters comes from diverse backgrounds with threats of similarities. They had potential to become inspiring and deep. Instead, they were writted to appeal to the lowest common denominator, forfeiting the intricacies that makes and breaks Disney Princesses and her companions that people should be able to relate to.Disney needs to up their game. For a multi-billion dollar corporation, they are doing poorly from a creative standpoint. The strong Princess stereotype is barely working, and it will break in the next decade without proper innovation and progression.",Raya and the Last Dragon

540,ol-11,Great spectacle - and yet ...,8,4 June 2021,"After having seen the trailers for this movie, I was really looking forward to see it, like to no other Disney movie since ""Aladin"". By now I have seen it twice in the theater (actually, as the first movie after the pandemic over here in Vienna) and once on Blu Ray. While I have some critical comments - see below, ""Raya ..."" for sure was no disappointment for me. Therefore, all these negative comments here are quite a surprise for me.First about the positive aspects in my view: Obviously, the optics of ""Raya ..."" are just gorgeous. The landscapes, the costumes, the architecture, the people, the animals ... Just gorgeous, and what a variety! The animation is flawless; the fighting sequences looked more real like in some live-action move, and the design of the humans were not as exaggerated as in many other 'cartoons'. With a length of close to 2 h, the movie has the epic feeling, which, for example, was missing in ""Mulan"". (And I still hope, someday I might be able to see it in 3D!) The characters are multifaceted; nobody is just good, just evil. The plot is well-constructed, it has suspense and wit.Yet, that brings me already to the not-that-great aspects of this movie. Well, the plot ... Obviously, it's a fantasy story, inspired by many influences from Southeast Asia, which is a nice alternation to all these pseudo-European-middle-age-fantasy-stories. I am not a big expert on fantasy, yet even I was able to see parallels to other fantasy stories, like ""The dark crystal"", ""The last unicorn"", or, of course ""The lord of the rings"". Regarding originality, ""Zootopia"" or ""Coco"" (to stay within the Disney-company) were superior. But this is acceptable; not every movie can define a new genre! More irritating to me was the just too obvious attempt of the filmmakers to fulfill every single dictate of political correctness. Okay, it is not as bad as in ""Everest"" (not a Disney movie; I know!), where the good guys are all Chinese and the evil guys are all Westerners. But in ""Raya"", the woman's quota is obviously overfulfilled, and, as far as I can see, all main characters are voiced by actors with ancestors from Asia. But what's the point? What we hear is always American English! Would have, let's say, Scarlett Johannsen made a worse job of voicing Raya than Kelly Marie Tran? I don't think so! (Don't get me wrong: I liked Trans job on this movie!) The ancestry of the actors would have been relevant for a live-action movie, but for a CGI movie? Not at all! And the attempt of the filmmakers to avoid any scandalization is that obvious, it's just embarrassing. It's a pity; the movie doesn't need this overcautiousness.",Raya and the Last Dragon

I've never seen such utter rubbish.The overall message of the film is nasty and for some reason is very obsessed with knives. What with current events as they are, this is a dreadful misstep for Disney. Encouraging and glorifying this kind of behaviour is not acceptable.6+ is NOT an appropriate rating and I'm appalled that Disney has even allowed this to get off the starting blocks.There is no story! There are no laughs, nothing to engage with at all. It's message is a horrible, nasty one.The dragon was cute until it opened its mouth and my last nerve snapped! I would be very upset if my culture had been ripped to shreds like the ones represented in this film. DO BETTER DISNEY! This is a shocking film and Disney needs to start reading the reviews and act on what they are being told. Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to seriously rethink the medium they are in.

It would've been better as a 13 episode series or something but as a movie, everything is rushed and theres very little sense of urgency or importance as its just all incredibly predictable in the way it plans out.

felt like a dungeon crawler , too many many characters .The characters werent very relatable they were so messed up in weird ways.I have to say that when i watched this movie i frequently saw places of the plot that could have being a little done better , maybe cause i have seen better stories .This is not hate i would see this movie if it is done better.",Raya and the Last Dragon

553,patskatsy,Pretty good but some key elements were lacking,7,5 March 2021,"Raya and the last dragon is a pretty good story with adventure and of course perfect for kids. However some key elements were missing. The lack of music is really obvious, in some scenes it is amazing, in other scenes, you just see a moving image. It feels a bit too rushed and that's bad because we don't have enough time to explore more the environment around Raya, her story etc. We just see her out of nowhere training, some scenes where she is a child, some fighting scenes and that's pretty much it. The plot needed to be more deep. Animation is good, nothing to add here. Raya's personality at the beginning is not that good but it gets better. Side characters are really good and they somehow found a way to impress me with the baby even though I thought it was going to be really annoying. In fact, the side characters had a more interesting story than Raya. That's where it loses a lot of points for me. The dragons' design is a ""love it or hate it"" situation and I'm on the hate it side. However, Sisu's character is amazing giving you some really important life lessons. A big minus is that they almost spoiled the whole movie in the trailers. In the end it's a good movie but for me it was still missing something that all the new Disney movies haven't. I still expected more but the final result was pretty good and I give them that. Maybe it doesn't deserve a re-watch but totally worth to watch it at least once.

When I heard it was Raya and something about a dragon I thought I would have to miserably sit through some boring kids animation. Although it started off painfully cliche, I walked out of the theatre pleasantly surprised. I haven't been able to sit through an entire movie-let alone kids animation-for a while. As one user said about it being formulaic-perhaps-however, I still felt I was watched something fresh and new. It made me laugh and cry. I felt a whole range of emotions watching it. I felt the sense of community among the passengers on the boat who all slowly began to trust eachother. After the opening, there wasnt a single dull moment. I feel the creators of this movie were really smart in how they presented this movie and the characters. I cringe at the word diversity, but this was really well done on that end. I loved their use of geography and how the map looked like a dragon instead of a distinct part of Asia so no one can claim innacuracies. None of the characters looked particularly chinese either. Everyone looked like a mixture of sorts. Raya had redeeming qualities and made you root for her despite being the cause of the main conflict. I especially lived Sisu. I immediately recognized her voice as Awkafina from Crazy Rich Asians. I couldn't see anyone else better fitting the role. The whole time I was thinking to myself how much I loved the human version of Sisu's hair. Which brings me to the last part of this review-the animation quality is to the moon. I never really liked cgi but this made me love it a lot. Overall, I would have given it a ten if it wasn't for the cringey opening. Even if it was needed for the rest of the story, it almost made me want to leave.",Raya and the Last Dragon
559,zyppy,Visuals are stunning but,6,5 June 2021,"The story is flat, unintresting charackters
And despite the many action scenes its boring.Unlike frozen it doesnt pull you in or swep you away.",Raya and the Last Dragon
560,fahmy-hady,Reviews are right but too harsh,8,7 March 2021,"This is a visual masterpiece, animations, colors, hair simulation. It's so fun to watch. Characters are really funny and the script is good.While it is incredibly entertaining, the story is very shallow and doesn't really try anything new or impactful. Great movie for kids and for adults who want to enjoy some action and visuals.My rating is because I'm blown away by the soundtracks and visuals but yea story is very vanilla",Raya and the Last Dragon
561,happyismoho,Decent but overall forgettable,5,6 March 2021,"Firstly the visuals were fantastic, as you'd expect. The story, characters and voice overs were not.Story is the same premise Disney have been churning out for years, absent parents, rise above yourself, save the world by using some moral keynote.The voice of the dragon needed to be a recognised comedian, think Eddie Murphy's Mushu, the voice they used didn't work. There was also no songs which was a disappointment, so overall it was ok, but forgettable",Raya and the Last Dragon
562,FritzRolle732,Raya and The Last Dragon Flies By Too Fast?,8,6 March 2021,"After watching Raya and the Last Dragon for the first time in theaters, I felt a bit of a rush going into this film. Now take as it may, almost everything was absolutely on point. When you deal with a pretty fast pace however, it is hard to connect with the film's merits. Raya and the Last Dragon had some amazing animation. From the fluidity of the water to well-motioned action sequences. In addition, the characters were absolutely enjoyable to watch. Especially the last dragon herself, Sisu. It was certainly a great sight to see! I just wished that the movie could have presented it in a bit of a slower pace. Instead, I felt like I was playing a game of leap frog with each scene jumping into the next. Going from one location to other, introducing a new character after the other, you name it. It all happens so fast, and I really wished this whole adventure could last just a little bit longer! Now this could just be me talking and someone else might get a different experience watching. No matter though, Raya and the Last Dragon is good start to 2021 animation cinema and I encourage general audiences to watch this. Just don't snore to the movie's ending in the theater like the father that was behind me. You will surprised how this all wraps up. 8/10",Raya and the Last Dragon

Unfortunately I have to agree with some of the people on here the voice of the dragon was awful and really really annoying, they really could have found someone who didn't sound so American!! Kinda spoilt the movie for me.Also the plot was very run of the mill Disney fair....but it did look Amazing.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The animation is spectacular, the characters are excellent, the message is universal and more relevant than ever, the action choreography is jaw-dropping, the comedy is hilarious, the story is incredibly strong, the world building is fantastic, and the music is perfect!People who bash it just don't get the movie's message or just outright don't like the comedy, which they're wrong on both accounts bc this movie is perfect!I'd give it an 11/10 if I could and this is Disney's best film to date!

575,regwebber,Disgusted,3,25 August 2021,"My 6 year old insisted on watching this movie because the dragon resembles chinese dragon which is our heritage. After watching the movie, researched the casts and trivia, I can't help feeling disgusted by the culture inappropriateness and the unspoken sino phobia.The type of dragon portrayed was originated in China. Once it was introduced to India, it was incorporated in Buddhism and demoted to a less impressive animal. The whole movie was set in an imaginary land, but full of culture references. The creative team spent time visiting all the places adopted or heavily influenced by Chinese culture and some are part of sino sphere, but they do not bother to mention anything remotely connected to China. This is just sooooooo annoying. China has existed for thousands of years, long before CCP took over. Hollywood has no problem using culture elements originated from China, but painted it over and mislead the unfamiliar audience with Asian culture. This is so dispectful. Just because other nations adopted chinese culture and customized to their traditions, it doesn't make them the origin of the civilianzation. We all know what most famous ancient civilianzations are. When can Hollywood put political agenda aside and probably present chinese culture nd civilianzation unbiased? Before they can do that, I have to stear my children away from any Asian fusion movies make by the west. I don't need these junks to silently undermine my kids' sense of pride in their heritage. I don't want my kids seeing a Chinese character and automatically think that's Japanese. I don't want them to watch Mulan and think it was a story about feminism and self realization. The past few years of hypened waves of marginize and demonize China really showed the true color ofany people. Situating.",Raya and the Last Dragon
576,freyix,A beautifully animated Disney movie that warmed my heart,10,7 March 2021,"I would best describe this movie as an action movie. Yes, it does have quite some comedy and deepness surrounding themes of trust, but the general feeling of the movie is action. And i feel like the fast pacing is an advantage in this instance. The fighting scenes where great! They felt exciting and very well done and every fighting sequence had its own characteristic.The characters are all very well thought out and the chemistry between Raya and Sisu is spectacular. All of the cast did an extremely well done job!It was overall a visually extremely beautiful movie, with stellar animated fluidity in both characters and elements of nature (like the water, which looked wonderful!).
The jokes suited both kids and adults, and in my family of all grown adults we all enjoyed the movie very much. The music was amazingly fantastic, and helped bring a deeper emotionality to the movie. In all honesty their decision of not making this a movie with singing-along parts was great!The movie felt fresh with the elements of Disney needed :)",Raya and the Last Dragon
577,ronwindy,"Beautiful Movie, I must emphasize it makes for CHILDREN",9,8 May 2021,"Some comments here are about how predictable this movie is, but, you know, it's a DISNEY's princess movie and I couldn't expect more about that.

591,farkins,Better than Frozen 2,9,11 June 2021,"If you like Moana and then was extremely disappointed with Frozen 2, you should watch Raya. The movie takes the beautiful animations of Moana and has an interesting story full of humor and heart. Unlike Frozen 2's excessive and awful music numbers, there is barely any singing in this. They don't sing just cause, the plot calls for it and it lasts maybe 30 seconds. Not saying I hate musicals, Sleeping Beauty is my favorite Princess Movie, but Raya felt new and fun like Tangled and beautifully animated like Moana. I'm sorry if your child is stuck watching Frozen 1 or 2, you should try this instead. My only downside was the baby and the monkeys seemed a little much at first, but they grew on me.",Raya and the Last Dragon

There was no moral depth, no emotional attachment to any of the characters, plot holes farther than the eye could see.

It seemed extremely unoriginal, didn't make sense in places and slightly came across as a rip off of the story from Moana.All in all It seems like Disney have hit a roadblock and should take a step back before releasing more movies, this is now their third film in a row that unfortunately didn't meet expectation",Raya and the Last Dragon

Absolutely zero mystique - which is what I suspect most of us hoped for with a story like this. And then.... the dragon spoke. I get it, she's the comic relief, but it just didn't fit. Nonetheless, it was good for the kids. Simple to understand absolutely beautiful to look at.",Raya and the Last Dragon

601,meangorilla07,My 3 year old liked it,5,24 May 2021,"Not one of Disney's best. The entire plot is meh. They don't go into much character development, so it's hard to love and enjoy the characters. It's very rushed. The animation is beautiful, minus the design of the dragons. Why does Sisu have Elsa's face?? I also couldn't get over all the pop culture references and stupid jokes. I get it's a kid's movie but come on... it was almost cringey. It feels like there should be much more to this movie but instead it got jammed into 90 minutes of nothing that interesting.",Raya and the Last Dragon
602,Frixcon,"It has it's moments, but it's kind of a rushed mess.",6,7 March 2021,"Don't get me wrong; this is by no means a 'bad' movie, and it's gorgeous to look at. That being said, the movie itself is kind of all over the place and leaves a lot to be desired.The main thing this movie is lacking is runtime.We have these factions, but they go through them so fast and show so little of each of them that they're barely significant. It's like having Avatar the last Airbender, but they only stay in every faction/element for about 5-10 minutes. It just doesn't really work.There's also just a lot of questions that never get answered, like why the rest of the dragons didn't come back when Sisu's brothers and sisters sacrificed themselves to beat the Druun the first time, or why (almost) everyone that gets turned into a statue takes on the exact same pose.While already being too short for the story and world this movie wants to show and tell; they also decide to bring along nearly every character they get in touch with, resulting in even less screentime for anyone and anything important. Especially the baby with the three monkeys felt unnecessary.Sisu is.. well, you either love her or hate her. I personally felt like she was a little too annoying and modern for a 500-year old dragon. She didn't need to talk to be funny/relatable. That was never an issue for Toothless from the How to train your Dragon franchise either. They were trying to hard with her.I truly wanted to love this movie and was quite excited to see it, but sadly it's really just nothing special. I think it would've been a more interesting adventure if it had just been Raya and her Tuk Tuk looking for the 'last dragon', not finding Sisu until around the end, because the movie was just the most interesting when Sisu wasn't there yet. 6/10 for me.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The animation was superb but the writing was really poor. The plot was bad and all over the place, the characters didn't make sense at all.

607,chipmonkey75,Beautiful and flawed,5,21 March 2021,"Sometimes I think I set my standards too high for Disney, but in this case, Raya just did not hit the mark for me.It's a cute movie, with a fine moral, standard storytelling, a few interesting if under-developed characters, but too many ""why?"" moments. A few spoilers follow...Why, when fleeing the Drunn, was Raya the only one to go into the water? Why doesn't anyone comment on Sisu's name -- being, you know, named after the most famous dragon ever. When the Druun walk through trees and grass, why doesn't it die instantly, the way people turn to stone?Why was the scroll so important... it wasn't a map; it showed the rivers, but they all connected to the same body of water so the hint about being at the end of a river didn't get much benefit from the map. How did it seem so obvious to Raya and Sisu that putting the stone back together would wake the dragons, when it didn't do that the first time around? Why did it, after all?How did the baby get their pants back?Why tell everyone that they can't help with the quest once they know what it is, when it didn't seem to be a problem letting them help when they DIDN'T know about the danger?What happened to the ""bad"" leaders of the tribes, once they weren't stone any more? I suppose they all become nice happy people, but some story there would be nice.Who are we supposed to root for later on... Raya doesn't trust Sisu when she says that she can trust Namaari, but every time Sisu has trusted someone so far in this movie it has gone wrong (she brought gifts to the old lady who fed her to the Druun, and sprung a trap trying to be nice at Spine); so when Raya reacts to Sisu appearing to pull the trigger, it's hard to disagree with her. Why, with her love of Dragons Namaari wasn't pointing the crossbow at Raya instead is a mystery.Anyway, I've gone on long enough.I can let some mistakes go by, but the best Disney films don't suffer this much from storytelling gaffes.The animation is exceptional, the colors are lovely; it is easy to find some brief comic relief, and I hope it did a good job being true to the culture it represented (I'm not a capable judge), but it just didn't hold any particular movie magic.",Raya and the Last Dragon

However, the story and characters just aren't that appealing or interesting. Normally with Disney films, I could relate to at least one of the characters but with Raya, I found none relatable.

Design of each nation is distinctive and beautiful, but it's unfortunate that each one only gets a few minutes of screen time. I wish this movie was a show so that the world building could have been explored in depth.My problem with this movie lies in the super weird design choice of the dragons. Why in the world do they look like My Little Ponies? And why fur? Why giant Elsa eyes? They literally look like Elsa's fursonas and it's disturbing. I also disliked Awkwafina's casting. I've watched other movies and videos with her in them, and it's undeniable that she has a unique voice that is easily heard. Unfortunately, my opinion is that it felt jarringly out of place when paired with the obnoxious dragon design and set against a fantasy backdrop.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Plus, I very much appreciated a movie where the main characters were women and not once did the movie make a big deal about it. That was cool.

624,abhishekarmarkar,Amazing,10,5 March 2021,This film is for both children and adults. You can enjoy watching it with family. This movie imparts education of organization and unity. The visual effects are very good. The animation is very good,Raya and the Last Dragon
625,bunbunlynn,The movie equivalent of trash. Turned it off after 20 minutes.,1,3 April 2021,"As a SE Asian, I find it uninspired and lazy. Seeing as how the other/previous films tried to stay somewhat true to the folklore, it's almost insulting to call this SE Asian. Couldn't they at least explore SE Asia or consult one to ask for folklore from our region?SE Asia comprises so many countries, this film is the equivalent of saying Mulan represents China, Japan, Korea and India. 15 minutes into the film and it was already a tragedy. 15 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. Add another 5 minutes which I took to construct this haphazardly written review. You might enjoy it as is for a cartoon if you ignore how poorly researched the film is with regards to actual SE Asian representation. Not even going to discuss at length how they didn't bother to hire a SE Asian cast. Great for kids if you're trying to placate a bunch of toddlers perhaps, absolutely nothing for adults.",Raya and the Last Dragon
626,jeannewoodman,Subpar movie with great animation,5,6 March 2021,"I get it. No new movies are coming out so anything is something. That sadly seemed clear in the creation of this movie. You can't deny the animation is great, but that's not enough. This movie follows typical Disney patterns. Absence of parents. Rise above your circumstance. Save your people. It's been done so many times. This one never seems to capture that emotional connection that others have. It feels like it stays surface deep. The lack of music was noticeable. Not sure where they would have added it, but it was missing. The character development could have been much stronger. The voice of the dragon was cringy and kept me from connecting with it. Overall, not a memorable movie either way and wouldn't suggest prepaying for it. Also, total ""My Little Ponies meet Care Bears"" vibe when the dragons are in a circle pushing energy out their chest. Talk about 80's throwback moment. Given how much Disney charges for everything, I assume their creators are well paid. Seeing what they have accomplished before it's also clear they put little effort in to this one. Working from home or not they could have done better on this one. It's like they didn't even try to make a great movie, they just knew they'd cash in with ANY movie.",Raya and the Last Dragon

629,ladnerlowery,This one was a surprise! A solid 7 and well worth a watch,7,6 September 2021,I'm not a great fan of cartoons and I usually mentally switch off when the singing and dancing starts. Thankfully no singing or dancing here!I'm surprised to read some of these reviews. My 8 year old son said it was the best Disney film he had ever seen. I thought it was a strong storyline and visually stunning! I dont think anyone is going to make a million on selling Maya T Shirts and merchandise will be in the bargain bin based solely on the fact there was less publicity. It isn't your usual shiny perfect world and contained some quite sad back stories for the characters. I would say the negative for me was the dragon character. It was meant to be funny but was as if it had been created for a totally different Disney film and dropped into this by mistake. It didn't have any actually funny dialogue and the colours were wrong for the film.If you haven't seen it I'd say give it a go! I will definitely be watching it again.,Raya and the Last Dragon

637,filipev-55792,It's an ok movie,6,12 August 2021,"I watched this movie without any expectations and the movie was exactly as I thought, it's not bad because the animation is very well done, but the story seems a mix of several other animations like Avatar and Moana (If they tell me that Moana is a mother Raya I would believe because the characters are almost identical), the dragons that were supposed to be the height of the film are ridiculous looking more like unicorns, the created universe had a lot of potential but the simple story and race does not take advantage of this universe. If you're less than 10 years old you'll love it, because the movie is very childish, as I said it's not bad just simple and too childish.",Raya and the Last Dragon

639,popitotoro,That's not how you make a good movie,3,6 March 2021,"Great animation, great visuals, good voice over for Raya, nice score, sure...
But what an abysmal lack of imagination in EVERYTHING. Same goes for the story telling and building: while watching this movie I saw Edge of tomorrow, Avatar (the anime), Indiana jones, looney tunes (baby), Spirited Away, Mulan...
Problem is, comparison only makes Raya and the Last Dragon look weaker and weaker as the references pop and you soon wish you would be watching any of those rather than this very dull tasting movie.
When the 'tributes' are all you remember at the end of a movie, it's not the sign of a new 'classic'. Or maybe that's now the definition of a Disney classic? Thank god Pixar is still making good original movies (Soul is great). Otherwise I wholeheartedly recommend Klaus from last year, to cheer you up after a disappointing viewing.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Soundtrack is okay, but falls far short of Frozen or Moana, Story is just okay. Jokes fall flat too often. Choises that characters, lead and supporting, make don't make much sense.All in all, worth a watch if you are in a good mood.

646,christian_crea,Some facts about the movie with spoilers,5,26 July 2021,"I love the movie in overall but there are a few things that made this movie suck.1. Sisu's voiceHer voice was really annoying can't stand it.2. Sisu's behaviorI know that there has to be a ""easy going"" character in a movie but Sisu is soo.. myopic. Trusting literally everyone is the dumbest thing you can teach kids...3. Sisu constantly mentioning her siblingsDoes she have to constantly mention her siblings throught out the whole movie? That was really annoying.4. The plotSoo you would think that Raya and Sisu would save everyone right? I mean that's what the trailers made you think and the posters but that's not what actually happened.So Raya wakes up Sisu from her 'slumber' because she needed her to fix the orb thing and expel those evil spirits. So they went to all the places and started collecting the pieces of the orb and by every piece added Sisu gained one of her sibling's power. So basicly a power up every time they add a piece. But before they add the last piece, Sisu gets ""shot"" and falls in the river. Later the same girl that shot her saved everyone.Long story short they didn't need Sisu. Soooo that dragon was literally ffing useless and Raya wasted 5 years to find her. 5 years where people lost a loved one every day.5. Sisu (the character)She talks soo much about her siblings and their powers/responsabilities, but what are her powers ? What can she do? Oh well... she is a great swimmer just like the rest of her species. In other words she is just a powerless debbie.6. The reason her siblings choose her.The reason they choose her is 'because' just because. She had no special powers or anything special that made all that work. They literally choose her for no reason. Anyone ( I repeat) ANYONE could've done that. They could've given that orb to a human for example.",Raya and the Last Dragon
647,hall-paige-a,Great story that they kept yanking you out of for some reason,7,10 June 2021,"As stated by many reviews, gorgeous looking movie, no debate there. Great soundtrack too. And the storyline was promising, but just when they'd start to really sink you into it, they'd yank you back out with some stupid humor (seriously, who approved the ninja baby character? Completely ridiculous) or by bashing you over the head with the theme of ""people not trusting and working together is what ruins the world"". We get it! Show don't tell. But on that note there was UTTERLY no reason the dragon had to stay hidden, their explanation was not sufficient - people worship the dragons, they would not harm her. There was no reason for Raya to steal the pieces, she literally just needed to walk up with the last dragon and they would've done anything for the dragon. Oh wait but that would end the movie too quickly, so we need some half-baked reason why that can't happen.On the whole though, if you can ignore that plot hole, the bits of childish humor, and feeling like your being jerked around by the storyline, it is still enjoyable. Certainly not a top Disney movie but still has its charm and emotion.",Raya and the Last Dragon
648,gurjitbad,Just enjoy the movie for what it is ...,9,7 March 2021,"Really don't understand the reviews less than 7 stars here clearly watched a different movie or they were expecting something else ...My simple view great animation , characters were funny ..yes the story line is simple but it's aimed at kids not anyone who is expecting a deep twisting plot ...from my perspective kids will enjoy it simple ...anyone else can turn to stone lol",Raya and the Last Dragon

650,oliveranteros,A meh story with fantastic animations,5,15 June 2021,"First of all, the animations are superb, there's no questioning that.The story on the other hand feels like if you took the story of ""Avatar: The last Airbender"" and squashed it down from 61 episodes (23min avg each) to about an hour and half. Then added on the entire conflict resolution story arc of the first season of ""Avatar: The legend of Korra"" at the very end, spanning a total of one minute. These two aspects made the story feel rushed and nothing the characters achieved felt earned nor deserved.(There's also one scene towards the end that single handily shrunk the world down from a large spanning ocean with multiple islands (the way the rest of the movie had portrayed it), to a small archipelago that can be traversed in a few minutes)If it weren't for the animation quality this would have been a 4/10 in my opinion.",Raya and the Last Dragon

652,glxsykes,NOT FOR ADULTS,8,20 June 2021,I know we've all gotten very use to Disney releasing movies for kids that young adults and adult can enjoy but this is NOT one of those ones.This movie is very clearly aimed at the younger generation and just the younger generation.If someone tells you they didn't like this movie and they are over the age of 10 then the reason is because they're too old.,Raya and the Last Dragon

654,rserowinski,A Brilliant Addition to the Disney Family,10,9 March 2021,"""Disney has hit another home run with this latest animated masterpiece and with very good reason despite having the same formula as their previous films, Raya and the Last Dragon is among the ranks of Zootopia, Fantasia, Tangled, Pinocchio, and Beauty and the Beast as among one of the studio's very best movies, and here's why?The story is very, very strong that's well told and action packed, on top of some heartfelt and emotional moments throughoutThe animation is just breathtaking, I've never seen such brilliant visuals in a Disney movie this amazing in a very long timeThe characters are just unforgettable and strongly memorable, with the lead, Raya played by Kelly Marie Tran, she's easily going to be a symbol for not just the Disney Princess franchise as she's so amazing as a main character, but also for the Disney theme parks within the next five-ten years, Sisu is the funniest Disney character since Aladdin's Genie, she's just hilarious every time she's on screen and Awkwafina did a brilliant job voicing the dragon, turned human, Tuk Tuk is such a cute animal sidekick, and the rest are easily as amazing as the two leadsOn top of a brilliant musical score composed by James Newton Howard, who scored some great music for previous Disney movies, but this is his best Disney score yet, it's so powerful and effectiveOverall, Raya and the Last Dragon is easily not just the best movie to come out in theaters during the pandemic era, but also one of the best films from Walt Disney Animation Studios, and will be remembered as a masterpiece that's a modern day classic right alongside Soul and even the likes of 1917, Parasite, Knives Out, Paddington 2, Black Panther, and Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse.So please by any means necessary, if there's a movie theater open near you, support your local movie theater and go see this latest Disney masterpiece, you won't be disappointed you will love every single minute of it, it was one heck of an experience",Raya and the Last Dragon

The visuals alone represent a masterful achievement from Disney, it's hard not to concentrate only in the amazing animation that surrounds the movie. The voice acting is also great and the basic premise of the story is incredibly creative. However the movie is far from perfect; it mainly uses the same Disney formula that everyone knows by heart, creating a story that, although creative and well presented, feels repetitive and incredibly predictable. The humor in the movie falls flat at times and it can take the viewer out of the suspension of disbelief bubble that is required from a movie like this. Overall Raya and the last dragon is a proof that the Disney formula can work, however it falls flat in comparison to other films that the studio has done in the past.",Raya and the Last Dragon

It's really not funny and the drama doesn't even really do much. The voices were fine but the story did nothing. The set up did not make you fall in love with characters and I from there on I could care less about the story. Hopefully Disney turns it around because this was terrible.",Raya and the Last Dragon
667,gavinplante,"Very Good, But Stumbles With Style",7,15 March 2021,"Disney seems to have this distinct style for every one of their movies. That's not a bad thing, since style helps distinguish one studio from another. You would have a hard time confusing a Pixar movie from a Dreamworks film. But for some reason, as much as I love Disney, that style makes this movie falter.The action is astounding; This is easily Disney's best animated action since Big Hero 6. The characters are nice, the comedy is hit or miss, it's super pretty. Basically all the basic stuff we've come to expect from the studio. Plus, the fact that we now have a Disney ""Princess"" from Southeast Asia is awesome.The plot seems a little too simple for a concept like this. Though there are a few parts that averted my expectations, I kept predicting what would happen next, and it would happen 98% of the time. Add in the constant addition of characters, leaving under developed characters in their wake, and it leaves a lot to be desired.The Disney style didn't work for me here. I, personally, didn't enjoy the design of the dragons, the monkeys, really any of the animals. With this world, I feel like if should have been less polished. Even though the human designs are alright, everything else clashes with itself. If that was the point, then it didn't make it clear enough to establish that.Overall: it's a Disney movie. It's an enjoyable time for the family, it'll tug at your heartstrings a bit, everything will end happy. I do recommend people watch this, as the animation is crisp and the fights are perfectly choreographed. Though I would suggest waiting until it's a matinee showing or public access on Disney+.",Raya and the Last Dragon

674,VinnyLSH,Raya did nothing wrong,7,5 June 2021,"""Raya and the last dragon"" may have spectacular visual, but its story writing is match with ""Avatar the last airbender"".The theme of trust is presented in an extremely inconsistent manner, especially when it comes to the dynamic between Raya and Namaari. Namaari is the embodiment of Raya's trauma and the source of her trust issues. And the way Disney wanted to push the lesson of trust and forgiveness is just so frustrating. Imagine Aang needing to trust Zuko at the end of season 2 right after his betrayal, and Zuko not having a redemption arc prior to that moment.Disney, if you want the audience to empathize with the ""bad guys who do bad things under uncontrollable circumstances"", at least give so character development to them. There is none of that for Namaari, no real person will go with Sisu's plan. The fact that Raya did already proved that she is better than most of us. Raya is a Saint, she is the Aang of her world. Disney, please don't invalidate her past experiences, emotions, and trauma.",Raya and the Last Dragon

There are plenty of those movies out there too. And yes, the dragon talks! It's a Disney/Pixar movie. Did you underrate Frozen because the snowman talked?!? I appreciated the behind the scenes clip about how much effort they put into trying to make this movie represent various Southeast Asian cultures, including all the scenery, different types of people, fighting styles, etc. I also thought the casting was good - I'm a huge Daniel Dae Kim fan.

690,rcoll-imdb,A Beautiful $100M+ After School Special,6,21 June 2021,"There's a definite theme through the reviews here both positive and negative. R&TLD has some of the most impressive visuals of any animated film ever produced, dustscapes and water a particular highlight. The art and visuals for locations and costumes are also a highlight that do a good job capturing the Southeast Asian aesthetic. The character designs and hairstyles are a little more generic, firmly placing each character in their assigned Disney archetype bucket (the doe-eyed hero, the scowling villainess, the oafish sidekick etc.)The story is the weak point, and feels more like a film designed by Disney's executive board rather than an organic story from a creative visionary. The first act is devoted to so much exposition that could have been spread out over the course of the film and been shown in creative ways as opposed to simply being told through narration. No character, even Raya, has especially strong traits or motivations. Even Sisi (the titular last Dragon) serves very little purpose in propelling the plot forward (which she does in a very literal sense at one point but otherwise she could have been written as a human character and no one would know the difference).Finally, we all get what Disney's doing here with representation. Representation is good, although I would argue that it's not particularly new for Disney who've been telling stories from all parts of the world since their 90's Golden Age, but now they're focused on making sure stories are told through the eyes and voices of people with heritage in those regions. That's good. I enjoyed Moana, and that was a widely-acclaimed celebration of Polynesian culture. But Moana was also a good film in its own right that fleshed out the main characters and gave them proper goals and motivations. Raya is far less effective on that front, which in time will probably hurt its legacy. Diversity for the sake of diversity isn't enough - you still need to be creative in your storytelling. Show, don't tell.",Raya and the Last Dragon
691,awangidaru,"This Concept, I like it",8,30 April 2021,"Well because this is an animation, so you can guess the plot. But I like the unifying concept that Disney chose for this film. And I love how the message can be conveyed clearly.",Raya and the Last Dragon

694,pearlcruzpickle,Missed Opportunities,6,4 September 2021,"As a person of South East Asian roots, I wanted to love this. But it had some very glaring issues:1. A South East Asian movie with the leads predominantly voiced by EAST ASIAN actors like Gemma Chan, Awkwafina, and Sandra Oh is a bit offensive when there are a whole lot of South East Asian actors that could have voiced these characters. Not that I have anything against these actresses, I admire them but it is misleading to champion the first South East Asian Disney movie when it is only that on the surface.2. Raya not having the usual grandiose Disney Princess treatmeants like killer songs and overall look breed of stereotyping us as a people. Which is unfortunate seeing as Lea Salonga, of South East Asian roots have been singing Disney songs for years. And here we finally had our own movie and somehow we didn't deserve all the bells and whistles.3. Seing as Disney movies have a knack for being so wonderful that you can't help watching it over and over again, surprisingly this is the one and only Disney movie that wasn't watched in our house for more than once which is ironic since as South East Asians we are the target market supposedly. And the re-watch factor just isn't there.",Raya and the Last Dragon
695,moises_tolki,excellent production but poor script,6,26 May 2021,"Raya is a very well made film, with an incredible level of animation and textures, but the script is written with little dedication and argumentative development, the antagonism and motivation of the enemies are superficial and what starts everything is even ridiculous ... in the end more or less entertaining, but it could be much more, what a shame that its creators only thought of entertaining the little ones.",Raya and the Last Dragon

It moved me to tears many times with emotions. For me this is the benchmark for the highscore.
Now what do we get? A strong young woman who fights for 6 years to fix the world that she has broken. Her crew is growing and adults might find some characters childish. These are obviously to entertain the youngest viewers. Apart from that the movie has its dark scenes and the depressing message not to trust anyone.

Simply put, a young woman goes on a quest inspired by the love of her father and discovers that all she ever needed, was within. How could anyone rate this classic hero tale so poorly? This one isn't for cynics. Is it a groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece? No. Is it a heartwarming visual feast that will keep you, your partner or your little ones entertained for a night? Absolutely! As the easy-to-follow story unfolds, it'll take you on a journey through a awe striking Asian-esque fictional kingdom that'll whimsically tickle the imagination, all while giving you a wholesome and timely reminder of what truly matters especially in such unprecedented times.

711,burtjasonr,"Kids are entertain, but not impressed",5,14 March 2021,"In the last decade or so, Disney has struggled to put together a meaningful plot, with a quality storyline. The plot here is pretty good, but the storyline and writing is lacking. Why does Namaari say that Sisu trusts her? For events that support the plot, they just flippantly throw it together. Disney has shown itself to be a Disney leadership have revealed themselves to be shallow business people doing the minimum required to make money? Don't believe me? Look up Michael Laney.

-the story is in the usual realm of predictiveness.
-i cannot bring myself to like awkwafina's voice, and probably never will, it was already irritating enough in crazy rich asians, and this time it was enough to put me off completely of her character (sisu the dragon)
-while i like the overall design of the movie, the dragons are just a joke. i can understand this is targeted at children and they want to make them as cute and likeable as possible, but they just look ridiculous in my eyes.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Firstly, the animation is fantastic and beautiful as always and they do some good design in the world and make some cool characters, that's where the positives end though.The whole film feels like the wrote one story, then watched it and decided to cut and paste things together, or add things in. There is absolutely no flow or consistency. To me, the motives of the characters just don't seem fully thought through and make little to no sense.I feel this film was incredibly rushed and many aspects are only there to sell some merch for Disney.",Raya and the Last Dragon
715,blake-74577,"SUPERFICIAL, CHILDISH, AND NONSENSICAL...BUT MOSTLY BORING. VERY UNLIKE DISNEY",4,6 March 2021,"I've seen a ton of animated movies, mostly DISNEY, and even when I was questioning whether I wanted to see them or not? Or perhaps just didn't know where they were going with the movie? The story and the plot always, ALWAYS made it memorable, had heart, and were classic.""FROZEN"", ""ZOOTOPIA"", ""TANGLED"", ""BIG HERO 6"", ""MOANA"", ""WRECK IT RALPH"", and the list goes on.This one doesn't even come close.Also, I have a daughter, a sister, a mother, and 4 nieces and they are all strong women, far stronger then me...but I am sooooooo done with female empowerment movies. Who ever said women were weak to begin with?This whole movie, almost every character or leader of a tribe is a woman, and by the end of it you're saying to yourself, ""What happened to the men?""There is little to no character development, and hardly any backstory...yet you have 5 Tribes, tons of different dragons, and a villain named the ""DRUNE"", which they literally tell you nothing about(they look like DISNEY stole them directly from ""EDGE OF TOMORROW). The DRUNE turn people to stone, BUT they never tell you how they do it or why? There is no singing, which usually covers up some weak points, and it literally feels flat, and the storytelling is horrible. The plot is superficial, childish, and nonsensical and simply put...boring. Very unlike Disney.There is no chase, no worry, no fear, no anxiety, no connection to the characters whatsoever.The movie starts out with a backstory of a young RAYA with her single father, but she's a punk, overconfident and very unlikeable. From there her father thinks all 5 tribes should be back together and invites them all for a dinner, not surprisingly they are betrayed and her father is turned to stone, but before he makes her promise to find the last dragon, and then the dragon stone they were guarding is dropped and broken into 5 pieces(big surprise every tribe gets a piece. When it breaks it rereleases the ""DRUNE"", the villains you will never know where they come from(SMH)Then fast forward to RAYA older, searching for the last dragon, and guess what?! She finds her 5 minutes into the movie! WHAT?The dragon ""SISU"" is just like donkey from ""SHREK"", comic relief, loud, silly, obnoxious, and they mention at least 50-100 modern sayings like ""GIRL WHO LIKES BLING"", and ""SISTER FROM ANOTHER MOTHER"", and so on and so on.But the combination of RAYA and SISU just doesn't work.The character development is minimal at best, and the storytelling is atrocious. You care nothing for the characters, mainly because of the lack of backstory and character development, and they fall victim to the almost 2 hour animated movie by stretching it out. You don't meet RAYAS crew right away, they make you wait throughout the whole movie, to meet each one, as she goes to each land to retrieve the 5 pieces. So her whole team doesn't get together until the end of the movie.There is no chemistry whatsoever between the characters and it shows in spades in this movie.The villain the ""DRUNE"", also due to lack of development doesn't scare anyone, and you just don't care about them or fear they will ever get to the heroes even once.So by the end of the movie when it finally gets serious, did not care whether RAYA lives or dies, nor the dragons or any of the other characters.",Raya and the Last Dragon

It's up there with Moana and Brave.It was perhaps a tad too long for our daughter because she did start getting restless towards the last 10 minutes or so and was climbing over the cinema chairs, she very much enjoyed it though and we will likely watch it many more times when it's streaming on Disney+ without the extra premium charge.Warning for parents: some younger kids might find some scenes a bit intense or scary, our daughter wasn't phased by this however.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The story is NOT predictable despite what others are saying. No one would be able to figure out the main theme of this movie. I'm Vietnamese and so I see a lot of references to food we eat a lot and the details they put into them is amazing. I like how the theme of the movie is something I hope that we people of this Earth, will try to achieve one day. I hope we find our Kumandra....

Some of them are not that developed (honestly, that is normal for a movie), but I find both Raya and Namari to be very relatable and I really like Sisu.The word-building, while not the most original, was understandable and beautiful.The plot, while not completely surprising was interesting, and I really enjoyed the message, even if it was not subtle (it is a kid's movie though, so I can forgive that). Same goes for the humour.What I adored most of all were the emotional moments. They are extremely well done, this movie had me in tears multiple times.I know people are giving the movie a hard time for being a bit derivative of Avatar the Last Airbender. I am not saying that it isn't.

The voice acting was also top notch, you could tell they were emotionally connected to their characters. So overall I would say 90 percent of the movie is enjoyable. However the 10 percent that isnt really kinda ruined the movie for me and was a big turn off for the movie. One big example is how clan Fang is constantly ruining the world over and over again and keeps getting trusted until they finally had no choice but to combine the gemstones because they literally were the last people not in stone thanks to their own dumb decision to backstab everyone (were also the main ones responsible for sisus death) and thanks to everyone stupidly trusting them again.Also hated the ending where the very chick (Namaari) who ruined the world and killed sisu was now the one responsible for saving everyone and all of a sudden everyone loves her and thinks she's awesome (not realistic at all.) That should have been given to Raya, and the whole constant trust aspect of the story bothered me, like is Disney trying to teach our kids it's okay to keep trusting people you know are going to stab you in the back until hopefully they come around because they litterally have no choice? Because that's not real life, real life you could die for trusting the wrong people even once. The morale of their story backfired because they are trying to say everyone needs to come together and trust each other to overcome trials in life and save everyone, but in their movie that doesn't happen until litterally there was no other option for Namaari to take than to trust and combine the gemstones because she was going to die and nobody was coming back if she didnt. Clan Fang even wanted to keep sisu for themselves before they screwed that up too. Idk.. the parts that I disliked about the movie really did kind of ruin the movie for me though, and I think they were trying to send the wrong message. However if none of that bothers you too much then the vast majority of the movie is really well done, entertaining and enjoyable. Plus the beautiful animation and awesome fighting scenes make it easier to ignore much of the annoying stuff.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Its better than Onward and Awkwafina is funny,9,9 March 2021,"There are no problems with film, its funny, its action packed and the animation as well as the sound are very good. It looks awesome on my OLED TV. My daughter loved it as well and its one of the few Disney movies where nobody dies at all highly recommend this movie.

This movie has it all. It's got a compelling story, awesome action scenes, hilarious original comedy and some really heart-wrenching dramatic moments. Cast was perfect for their chosen characters. Children and adults will be entertained by this movie! We saw it in IMAX which I also would recommend if it's an option for you!

Great job Disney!!",Raya and the Last Dragon
745,wcjbbt,This movie is flat out AMAZING!!!,10,8 June 2021,"This movie is so good!!!! It's plot is not predictable and caught me by surprise a couple times. It's far from boring. Some people say it's boring, predictable, the voice overs are bad (they aren't), don't listen to them. The characters are very likable. The animation is the BEST I've ever seen, it looks so real. This is one of Disney's best is not the best animated film.",Raya and the Last Dragon
746,masterpolypragmonstudios,A collection of clichés with good visuals. That's it.,4,11 March 2021,"Disney is losing its touch. They are afraid to take new steps, and they repeat all their older ones.
Despite having stunning visuals, the movie is easily forgettable. Perhaps Disney should invest in smaller studios so they can make original stories, so we can finally see something new, that we can actually discuss over it.",Raya and the Last Dragon

748,talleschaves,Incredible and innovative,10,8 March 2021,"Disney finally steps out of the box and gives us something completely new. Instead of musicals, we get amazing fight sequences. The story has a compelling and strong message as well as gorgeous visuals.",Raya and the Last Dragon
749,vanleeuwenthomas,Story was everywhere.,5,10 March 2021,The animation is beautiful but the story was poorly written. Each scene is very short and there is very little character development. However children will love this film for all of the colors and humor.,Raya and the Last Dragon

Grow up. GREAT movie!",Raya and the Last Dragon
751,doncaldwell-61611,Excellent movie for the family!!!!,9,9 March 2021,Visually beautiful!! Great martial arts scenes! Really enjoyed watching this with my family.

752,akhileshbalajiadisb,"Good, but could have been better",7,25 March 2021,"I have nothing much to say for this, I thought it was a visual delight as we expect from Disney, but some of the scenes were kinda boring and story holds it back for me",Raya and the Last Dragon
753,artpopsickle,Not quite Moana but way better than most recent Disney movies,9,7 March 2021,"Out of recent Disney and Pixar films from Frozen 1 up till now I would put this in my 2nd place just behind Moana. But definitely more entertaining than Frozen at least for me. Now maybe a kid won't feel that way or someone who is into more romantic sing songy kind of princess Disney flicks but to me this really brought a much needed breath of fresh air to the Disney animation library!! I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ACTION ANIMATION FILM BY DISNEY!For the grownups:
Pros: The message of the movie was super current to today's times, was visually stunning, the action was really entertaining and rather creative, the soundtrack was also impressive (though no musical numbers in case that's your things), and the pacing of the movie was fantastic!
Cons: Some of the jokes weren't all that funny but it's a kids movie I guess...the writing for the overlying story was fantastic and some of the dialogue that moved that story along was as well however some dialogue felt a little I don't know can't put my finger on it.
BUT OVERALL DEFINITELY WORTH A WATCH!!For the Kids:
My niece absolutely lovedddd the characters and got super invested in Raya and all of the relationships she made from beginning to end! She particularly invested in the dragon, baby, Tuktuk, AND RAYA'S FATHER! She loved all of the creative magical powers, magical creatures, DRAGONS!, and even the weapons and the creativity choreography for the action scenes and how the characters used innovative ways to get out of the pickle they were in.She is normally scared of any monsters or creatures and the monsters in this movie didn't phase her though the emotional impact they made did. She didn't cry but I could tell she was definitely feeling sad and was very invested in what was going to happen.Pros: bright colorful and visually stimulating, adorable creative new creatures you've never seen before, silly moments, important lessons in friendship and family, positive female role models, female characters that didn't need any romance or saving of by a male character.Cons: I guess if they are used to the Tangleds, Frozens, and Moanas they may feel it is lacking fun memorable songs they can learn and sing along to. However I will say this movie is something you as a parent probably wouldn't get sick of watching over and over because there aren't very many slow moments....the pacing is probably the highest points of this film along with gorgeous animation!",Raya and the Last Dragon

755,RyankAfton,Favorite movie for my daughters.,10,7 March 2021,This movie blew me away. Two daughters age 2.5 and 5.5 and they loved this movie. Best kids movie I've seen since Moanna. Strong girl heroes and a great message. Never too scary for the kids and the animation and scenery is beautiful. This is our new favorite. We loved the baby and monkeys and all of the booby traps!!! Why can't more kids movies be like this? Enjoy :-),Raya and the Last Dragon
756,jademj-15631,Basic storyline,4,28 March 2021,"Although The details and visuals were beautiful, the storyline itself was very basic and unoriginal. The dragons (sisu) voice was a bit annoying, imo, but other than that, it was a nice kids movie.",Raya and the Last Dragon

761,CarbAbsorber,Expansive Worldbuilding made the story seem rushed,8,24 May 2021,"The world was very expansive and creatively made from the Southeast Asian culture, but maybe a little too much was crammed into the story? Whenever Raya and co. Travelled to the different territories, it really felt like not much time was given to learn about each place. It also felt like certain aspects were for plot convenience or as if they were thrown in last minute.Other than that, I thought the characters were well developed despite what other people say. I know this movie cost 30 dollars to watch but I decided to look past that to give an honest rating. I don't think this followed too much of the classic formula, it had it's own unique bits. My opinion, wait until it doesn't cost 30 dollars and watch it. It's worth it.",Raya and the Last Dragon
762,romaindussotpem,Pretty cool,9,11 June 2021,"As a regular customer of Disney movies, this one was pretty enjoyable even as an adult.I think it would be really cool to see it in a cinema, but still, the film is great.

763,captainlangley,"Lazy script writing where plot was overtook and railroaded by ""message about trusting people""",1,28 May 2021,"This is probably one of Disney's worst movies. The plot was lazy and the end of the movie was rushed. Furthermore, the focus of the movie was almost just as much about the ""message of trust"" as it was about the plot.

Character's development is very linear which ain't good. The example is: This person is bad so all of their characteristics are bad. The script is quite bad so I'm shocked over those reviews. So much things didn't make sense and i understand that is a kids movie but that doesnt mean if someone took more time on perfecting those imperfections like for example: Raya of course would see at least the down part of turned into stone dragons and that for sure... or how was there water before if the dragon who couldve create rain was dead. And i saw these types of things a lot more on just one viewing. That doesn't mean i didn't enjoy it because i loved it.

Then one day, a disaster came and changed everything in the worst way. It's affect divided Kumandra into five parts, where each of the parts hated another. At that time, Raya was born, and she worked to reunite Kumandra and restore peace there.It was good to see the blending of Southeast Asian culture and mythology into the Disney world. All the characters, world building, and storytelling were strong and amazing in this old-fashioned animation. The fight scenes were wonderful as well. I love Raya and her gang work.

776,mfettema777,"Not bad, but not great.",6,6 March 2021,"Raya and the Last Dragon had the chance to be something really special, but instead devolves into the predictable very quickly.As a quick break-down:
Visuals: 8/10. The animation is great, the overall aesthetic easy on the eyes, but hardly cutting-edge any more compared to other modern fare.
Audio: 7/10. Rich in places, somewhat dull in others, the musical score is lacking somewhat, sounding far too generic in places.
Characters: 5/10. Raya is likeable enough, and shows at least some character growth over the movie. Sisou is your standard, boring ""quirky side-character"" who feels wasted being so, and could have been much stronger if played more seriously. Everyone else is forgettable, there only to support the thin plot.
Plot: 3/10. Tired, rehashed, and full of the standard tropes. Nothing new, exciting, or thought-provoking has been brought to the table.Overall: 6/10. Adults will watch it once and forget about it quickly. Children who really like cuddly, furry sass-talking dragons will likely enjoy it more.",Raya and the Last Dragon
777,magic_feet,A forced hand is not trust,5,6 June 2021,This movie message was lost on me. This movie encouraged stealing instead of using one's voice.

Story is really weak sometimes and at lots of turning points it's predictable. Almost all of characters and little stories are borrowed from other movies. A beautiful young warrior, her femme fatale nemesis, a naughty little girl and a little Know- everything sailor. What's new? Thanks God they didn't at a handsome prince to fall in love with main character.Considering characters, story, dialogue and comedy, you don't get surprised at all, everything runs as predicted.But for sure kids are going to enjoy this because of great fights between heroes, so of you are going to watch this with your kids, grab popcorn and do so.",Raya and the Last Dragon

It has to be simple. And speaking of that, simplicity is what makes this movie perfect. It's very easy to watch, but still teaches a lesson what all good family movies should do. The plot isin't just boring princes (looking at You ""Frozen"" fans). More like warrior princesses, apocalypse, betrayl, dragons! And if someone calls this boring they don't know what they're talking about and should just go back to watching well ""Frozen"" I guess. Oh and for a guy saying that Disney doesn't make villains anymore. Dud, You're kidding Me right? That's the best desicion plot wise they ever made! That's one of the main reasons why Ghibli's movies are so succesful. It's plotlines doesn't contain only bad or good characters!

787,stigiscool1,'Raya and the Last Dragon' Review,7,5 March 2021,"I was really excited to see 'Raya and the Last Dragon' as I am a South East Asian and this movie is themed to South East Asia. I am glad I watched it as it is a really good movie.The film is visually gorgeous. The locations and creature designs are vibrant and full of detail. The action sequences are also exhilarating. And the visual spectacle is well complemented by James Newton Howard's amazing score. Besides that, thanks to the excellent voice acting and writing, I got really invested in the characters and their journey throughout the film.As for flaws, there are definitely some convenience and contrivances sprinkled throughout the film. For instance, why would Raya let Namaari know the location of the orb? I get that Raya wanted show appreciation to Namaari, but that is like giving your password to your friend whom you only just knew.In sum, I really like 'Raya and the Last Dragon'. It has some plot problems, but I still like the story overall. I am glad Disney decided to make a South East Asia inspired film, and I definitely recommend seeing it.",Raya and the Last Dragon

789,leannewhelan,Too much fighting throughout entire film,1,13 April 2021,"I was so disappointed in this film. The underlying message of trust and work together is a good one. However it's marred by the entire film from start to finish being filled with impending doom and physical violence.Yes, little kids need to see strong female characters and hero's, but I think that this could have been portrayed with less fighting. It basically showed that to resolve any disagreement you can just kick someone in the face and whip out your sword to fight to the death. This wasn't just one or two scenes, it was the whole film, many scenes.The only scenes I really liked were those with the dragon in it; she brought some humour into the film.For an adult's film, fine for this much violence, darkness and doom.For a kids film, come on filmmakers, you can do better than this!If we weren't with friends, I would have walked out. My daughter (8) actually told me afterwards that she wanted to go home during the movie.",Raya and the Last Dragon

It's a nice family film and my 13 year daughter absolutely loved it but it's just missing the key elements of what makes Disney films so great. Some of the characters are unlikeable, there are no songs and it's not that funny. I know films don't need to be funny to be good but usually Disney films have an aspect of humour, but we barely laughed for the whole film. I also found the baby a very irritable character. My advice would be to wait until it's free on Disney plus or until the DVD is released and not to pay the premium price, it is worth a watch but I'd rather do it for a little cheaper",Raya and the Last Dragon

793,sharonemmanuella,It's surprisingly good,8,8 March 2021,"Honestly, at first I feel sceptical and kind of worried about this movie (especially after Mulan fiasco). But then they proved me wrong. It's surprisingly very entertaining. The story probably feel general, but I really love how they executed the story.
This movie really have a lot of action scenes, the visual also really stunning, and the soundtracks are amazing.
I know this movie is a mix of the cultures of all Southeast Asia, so it's definitely not like Coco or Moana. But honestly, I feel represented with this movie. It feels so great to watch a movie and can see your cultures in it. Some people probably won't understand how emotional it is when you grew up watching Disney and then finally can see a Disney character that have the same skin color, wearing the same fabric that you usually wear, eating the same food, living in the same environment, and so much more (I screamed when I saw the lady that makes batik).
Also, all of the voice actors and actresses are doing such a good job with this movie.
The dragon design might be too cute, but honestly this is Disney that we all talking about.
Overall, the only thing that lack is the promotion of this movie. And also the limited access especially on some country in SEA itself. Come on Disney!p.s: Sisu is really innocent and baby Noi is so cute ❤",Raya and the Last Dragon

It had potential to be a good movie but it was a bit too much packed into to small amount of time they were given, so the movie didn't have enough time to develop the characters and the plot properly. I also think they said and referenced some things that were a bit too modern, making it kinda off-putting, like ""dragon nerd"" and ""group project."" Overall, it was just okay. The animation was beautiful though.",Raya and the Last Dragon
805,isenschmidrene,Beautiful film,8,26 April 2021,"Seriously. What's wrong with humanity? All these people who give this film a 1/10 have lost their mind. Don't take a single one of these review scores seriously. That isn't a question of opinion. Those people have an agenda. They're bitter human beings, hiding in the anonymity of the internet behind their desk and post their biased, pitiful buzzwords. Review-bombing a film for kids, how pathetic and miserable are they?Seriously, I respect different kind of opinions. I respect that people perceive and rate films differently. I would accept it if people give that film a 4/10 or a 10/10 because they genuinely believe that and because that's in a range that I would see as ""plausible"". But anyone who gives this film a 1/10 is not a reviewer. These persons are totally biased and not qualified to give a proper score.The film was wonderful. Animations are top-notch. The story is clichéd, but okay. In the end, it's a movie for kids and even though I still like watching Disney films, they can't be compared to complex, non-animated films because they're targeting a different audience. So I'm not expecting a film like Memento here, but that should be obvious... Although the film lacked the typical songs, I found the soundtrack quite beautiful and atmospheric. To sum it up, it's a nice story and an overall beautiful film for everyone.",Raya and the Last Dragon

809,borsgyurki,A pile of unoriginal characters and story,3,22 September 2021,"I dont want to ruin anyones expectations, experience and fun they had while watching ""Raya and the Last Dragon"", this review only expresses my own opinions.Yes, the animation is on Disney level and makes my rating for Raya and the Last Dragon grow by 2 stars, but all the whacky designs and bad jokes slapped into your face blows the excitement of the animation away.It's not only that the dragons look terrible, trying to be cute while those lizzard like creatures still haunt my dreams. Young Raya in her backstory is basically just early concept art Katara from ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"". (Theres a lot more unoriginal characters, but telling them all would be overkill.)Watching the movie for a second and third time with my smaller brother also made me question most of the characters choices and the sense of the movie. (spoiler:) Why did the blue crystal have to be broken and put together if it was complete for a lot of years? Until it does not turn out that the ""Dragons"" can tell the future and give them kids in the future a lesson of trust, which is supposed to be the moral of the story, which is NOT the case, i dont think i will be able to believe any explanations of this problem.The Jokes. Oh boy, they were not good at all. The film is set in the unurban days. Making jokes that reference future that didn't happen in the universe the movie/series is set in, it can be done VERY well, but this movie just couldn't.What im trying to express here is that even Disney movies can be big cashgrabs. This movie had too many things for one movie, but few things for a whole series.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Sure, the design of the dragons were meh, the storyline dull, the characters bland and the voice of Sisu was annoying, but the main thing that brought this film down for me was that they hadn't bothered to cast any actor (except for the actor voicing Raya) of SE Asian descent. Don't get me wrong, it's great that it wasn't whitewashed, but also Chinese/Korean actors are often well represented in Asian inspired movies and it just had a sour taste that they couldn't give this to SE Asians like they did with Moana.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Sure, it's a pretty basic McGuffin plot and the second act is a bit redundant, but it's still a good movie. It has a unique world and characters. Sisu was really likeable for me and I had a good time whenever she was on screen.My personal favorite of the side characters is Tong, given how surprsingly tragic his story is for a side character. It's bad enough he lost his whole tribe, but he also lost his family, including his baby. And he puts on this mask of being this really tough, feared warrior to hide his pain. I was honestly really happy for him once everyone came back and he saw his village full of life again.The action scenes are done wonderfully and the music is great.

And that dragon sushi, hmm, not funny at all, so stupid, ah actually that's called smart a$$, other characters is too weak and blur, like the undercut hairstyle girl
I still enjoy to watch this movie as it's beautifully created. That's why 5/10 Just the content is not as good. You can build the characters that believe in others, but build them a bit smarter, the father let the enemies in but, AT LEAST, be more responsible by providing more guards, then okay, still can be taken down by the enemies bc they are stronger, that's still fine, the story line still go on. And the dragon, after being tricked by that old lady, should have she learnt a lesson (??) she still can trust people, but shouldn't she be more aware when coming to new land (??), the story still can go on, she didn't just brought the soup to the door, they sneak in and got trapped by that guy, still can make better sense.

But after watching the movie, I was a little disappointed. The South East Asian reference was not as I expected. The design of the character and dragon is more East Asian. Most South East Asian dragon is legless (influenced by the South Asian (India) culture). The weapon is trying to resemble the Kris but it is failed because it look like wavy sword.
Despite that, the story is typical Disney that fun to watch as family movie. Children and teenager and Disney fan will love to see it.

We watch movies every weekend, and once we picked out Raya to watch. I had no negative or positive expectation. We really enjoyed the movie, and I have to admit we get the tipical Pixar quality. The hairs are just absolutely stunning, and everything is just beautiful. Except one issue. When the dragon first appear, the whole family yelled up together, what joke is this? It looks like some bad My Little Pony reference, and also ugly. They made it professionally, really nice work on the fur and other stuff. But the design and personality of the Dragon, is just ruined the whole experience for all of us. Just like that Sonic movie, expect it wasn't repaired this time. I really appreciated that finally we get a Disney movie without those musicals, because I always hated that since the very beginning.I mean do not mistake me, the Dragons personality was cute, except her MLP be friends and magic obssession. And of course her appearence in dragon form was ugly. My problem is, I understand we have to appeal for kids and make sure they will sit over that 1 hour 45 minutes. But making an all mighty ancient dragon to this? Why? All the movie had such an interesting and serious story. We all wanted a great dragon, and then we got a pony. It was a dissapointment. Also if I may mention, this obsession is pretty agressive against history. This cliché when characters speak about some all mighty person in the history who saved the world and had so much power. And then character appears and its a silly, goofy person. I dont think it worked well in this case. Defenitely worth to watch this movie, and I strongly recommend it.",Raya and the Last Dragon

I've noticed that Raya uses a lot of filipino things such as the Arnis, the sword and hat. The colour of the skin, portions of the bodies and overall clothing shows just how much diversity the countries that it's taken it's inspiration from has and I was very glad to see that Raya has a button nose like I do.Once again, a female lead that did not need a love interest. Once again, shows just how important family is. The sword fight? Immaculate. Strong characters and examples of how much greed and selfishness can destroy the world.The theme song also has a tagalog version to it, which my family loved.The design of the dragons could have been better, though. The blue dragon looks like Elsa.",Raya and the Last Dragon

It had some humor, but it wasn't overly slapsticky.It didn't feel like I was watching a Disney movie, I finally realized it was because it wasn't a remake or a sequel or a spinoff. Disney should stop making them and make more original movies like Raya and the Last Dragon.",Raya and the Last Dragon
878,christinecambura-69277,IT'S BAD! ANNOYING!,1,24 October 2021,"I expected more from this movie and I am disappointed.The animation looked great and character designs looked fine except for the dragons. They look like toys and move like dogs instead of elegant dragons from SE Asian mythology. Also, the voice acting was very mediocre and annoying especially when Awkwafina says her lines. Another thing was that using very modern terms where this movie was set in an Ancient Civilization and also the overuse of jokes which makes everything annoying especially with Awkwafina's voice added to it and the characters were also very under-developed.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The mi yes that have come out in the past few years from other studios have not hit the mark for me. This in the other hand, was fun and entertaining to watch. There were a lot of laugh out loud moments. Sure the movie is pretty predictable. My wife and I were calling the moments the whole movie long. But what Disney / kids movie isn't predictable. It's also nice to see some diversity in these movies. Being Asian myself. It's so good to see a film with an Asian cast. More like this please.

882,Mentalfist,Falls very flat,1,5 March 2021,"It looks good, the animations are great and the world is pretty. But oh boy is the plot bad. Superficial, childish, nonsensical and simply boring - very unlike Disney. And there isn't even any music to make up for the lack of content.There is only a bunch of boring fighting, two young girls showing off, jumping around and hitting each other Kung fu style.Stay away from this one..edit: downgraded my score after letting it sink in how bad this actually was.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The characters are great, the dragon Sisu is fantastic, it is visually stunning and the story is full of soul and heart.

888,matt-petty,I hated almost everything about this.,3,19 June 2021,"I hated almost everything about this, from the bad acting to the terribly boring storyline. The CGI is hit-or-miss and swings from excellent to distractingly bad.

Honestly I really don't know what to say talk about a missed opportunity for a great mythical film with a awesome lead with martial arts skills. Tuk Tuk should get its own film the rest is just the stupid talking dragon. Disappointing.",Raya and the Last Dragon
890,larissapontez,"Color-by-numbers, condescending & lazy",2,6 March 2021,"Were there even any script writers involved in this? Because I'm pretty sure the executives just stitched this movie together with bits and pieces of every other film and then plastered ""trust"" on each and every dialogue.
Can you spell out the moral of the story one more time, Disney? A bit louder, for the slow kids in the back.
Couldn't even be bothered to hire some composers to distract us from the gaping plot holes with some catchy songs.
Laziest, most condescending Disney production in a long time.
The only reason I'm not giving it a 1 is that the animation was very well done. The poor art department deserved better.",Raya and the Last Dragon

893,c_i_grant,A lockdown marvel,8,5 June 2021,"Ok so this isn't a 10/10 film, it's a solid 7/10. It is no where near the worst Disney ever, yes the second act drags a bit but hey the visuals are stunning, the voice cast are good and there's some great one liners. Is it predictable? Yes pretty much, but it's Disney and most Disney animated films are predictable! So I said 7/10 film so why 8/10 score? The extra point (and I think I'm probably being mean here) is that a lot of the film was made in a lockdown! The cast recorded at home, the animators were at home. They made a film over Zoom, or Teams or whatever networking tool they used. Honestly has anyone had an hour meeting online without an issue? They made an entire film like that! I'm a drama teacher and spent the last lockdown (in uk) teaching online lessons, it nearly broke me having to be IT technician to 20 odd students when things went wrong, and all I wanted was a one minute monologue. They made an entire film!!! The fact this isn't the worst (and it really isn't) is AMAZING! Anyway technical issues aside, thus us a really enjoyable film give it a go.

898,Pandastic,Gorgeous movie but...,5,7 March 2021,My biggest problem with this movie was the contemporary dialogue. Characters didn't talk like you would expect them in such a fantasy setting.The other major downside of the movie are the shallow characters. Barely any characters feel fleshed out and the ones who are felt pretty much by the numbers.Positive aspects of the movies are obviously the art direction and the animation. I think the movie picked up on quality. The last third was pretty good although pretty cliché.All in all even though the director seem to be of Vietnamese descent the movie felt incredibly American with a thin paintjob of an Asian inspired movie. This is only superficial.,Raya and the Last Dragon

The main 2 female characters aged 6 years soooooo...Also movie was predictable and bang average.,Raya and the Last Dragon
901,Rhydil,A Let down for Disney's standard,2,11 April 2021,"Straight to the point why the movie is a dissapointment for a Disney standard.Raya The last Dragon is a movie about a girl who lost everything and faith decided to reward her with a big blue lizard that you wish she just shut up.Sisu a.k.a Awkfina, Sisu is like ripoff of Mushu with the add on of annoying and obnoxious voice.The plot was rushed, we jump from one place to another to get the fragments without really much that of a challenge, judging by how critical of the Raya's world state.We suppose to believe Sisu and Raya are tight close friends/sisters, while the conversation that they have and chemistry between the characters is not so believable, the rushing of the plot get in the way of the bonding which make all the characters underdeveloped""You know when you do a group assignment, and you score that subject because you group with the smart kids.."", for real?, why and how did that line was approve to be made it to the film.The jokes in the film is not so good, in comparison to some other Disney's films.Not a fan of the baby character (Noi), with the level of seriousness and urgency our heroes are dealing and characters that the movie presented to us, her existed just dont seem fitting.Noi is such a character thatdesigned so that disney can manufacture cheaply made stuffed toys to sell as Merchandise to the kids.Lastly is Raya's trust issue, her reason is solid. However, nearing at the end where she's was part of the reason for not listening to Sisu's advise. And change her mind and trust Namaari, is such awkward and out of character decision.I feel like most westerners would enjoy this film, as it's something different and new for them.The film does have a good animation but is Disney, is it worth mentioning.The plot was just okay, very forgettable, very questionable how some critics and reviewers can give the film anything higher than 4 stars.If you watch the film in a way is so bad that it's good. Laughing at the film instead of with the film. The film is actually enjoyable to watch.Suitable for age below 10 I would say.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Fun characters and a strong ensemble. It's not a musical but it does have beautiful music. Visually stunning with great messaging for children and adults. The movie has a South East Asian feel, which is a nice change for Disney. I also like that there is no central love interest, there is more focus on teamwork and trust. As a parent I'm also looking forward to the costumes because there are pants rather than dresses and summery attire.",Raya and the Last Dragon
908,nishru7,"Not a perfect one, but still very much enjoyable...",8,9 March 2021,"I really liked the movie - it's a great mythical tale of how differences broke the world and very few trying their best to mend it back together. Stunning visuals, good sound design, enjoyable story, well written characters, emotional moments and no woke BS that Disney is full of now (weird to make it a plus for production, but we are where we are these days). Of course it's not a perfect movie, nothing is, but it is an enjoyable watch, that's for sure. Sure, Awkwafina may have annoying voice for some, but in all honesty I like the actress. Haven't seen her in that many movies (Crazy Rich Asians comes to mind), so I'm not really fed up with her or her voice...and she's entertaining enough. As for the baby running scams...yeah, okay...but it looks like some forgotten this is Disney animation, stuff like this is not far from normality for their productions. The only other thing I was hoping for to be better - given the world, story was taking place in - would be a better score. I was counting on one or 2 tracks to be standing out, something very easy to remember, you know...one of those that run around your head from the moment you hear them, but that didn't happen here. It is an okay soundtrack that helps building the atmosphere of scenes, but doesn't really elevate them, just serviceable.",Raya and the Last Dragon
909,KezzDaddy,Beautiful but thats about it,3,8 March 2021,"The animations, textures, particle and characters designs are all very beautiful. The movie itself is full of inconsistent world laws, boring fight scenes and bad dialogue.

Enjoy what it is. It's a little sad not being able to watch this in the cinema, but I hope everything is fine after this. This is the right film to watch in this time of the pandemic to spread a new sense of positivity in today's day.Visually this film is very astonishing. The animations are great and very detailed. From what I found in the film, the filmmaker is very thorough in creating the background story which is inspired by Southeast Asia. Lots of references that can be found if you were born and lived in Southeast Asia. But people from other regions can still enjoy and understand this film (although Southeast Asia naming might be difficult to pronounce by the native English tongue).I was a little skeptical of the story at first. The story starts off rather weakly, but the film picks up a fast pace in the middle. And the ending is very good and can cover the weaknesses of the story at the beginning.It's a bit unfortunate that this film can't explain everything in the story, the film has a lot to explore. I guess this is the type of film that should have 3 hours of screen time. but I think the filmmakers are still doing a great job covering the most important things.",Raya and the Last Dragon
911,gvozdenbuzdovanovic,Stepping out of the common format,10,19 March 2021,"I was pleasantly surprised by this Disney cartoon, it is out of Disney's recognizable and, I must confess, tiresome format that we have seen in the last decade or so. Finally they dropped the characters ""being funny and witty"" and made them more close to realistic. Story is excellent, smooth, interesting. Characters are well developed, music is on the pitch, always present, not assertive. This is the line Disney should follow in the future. There are so many different legends and lores from the many peoples of the world that they can bring their magic upon.

It makes the movie painstakingly difficult to get through. Storyline was fine, animation was beautiful, and main character Raya was great. But I agree with others in that the dragon's voice was annoying and disappointing. I don't think I've ever been so annoyed at a Disney character aside from maybe Opaf..but that was just the character as a whole.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Believable character development. Adorable baby and funny dragon. All in all good entertainment, typical Disney style.

I thought, at the very least its something to entertain my 1 and 3 year old children. They actually aren't interested in it at all.For me it was incredibly disappointing. Its visually stunning but cliché and simple.I watched the making of Frozen 2 documentary on Disney plus. That really blew me away because the writers and creators didn't even know or understand the plot of their own story until the very last minute. And relied on the songwriters to piece together their ending and make it make sense! That opened my eyes that Disney is just pumping movies out focusing only on catchy songs and visuals. With all their budget, writing and storytelling comes last.Raya and the Last Dragon, like I suspected, is the same. Except we don't even get catchy songs. I was expecting a twist, a surprising, emotional moment at the end? Some interesting lore about the nature of the dragons and their wisdom?Nothing great came of the ending. I didn't feel any of it.Also, I am sick of watching a kids movie and always being right when I guess that their one parent is gonna die in the first 20 minutes.At least Pixar can get it right some of the time, (Coco). Disney hasn't hit it out of the park in a long time.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Give me a break people- isn't that the reason we WANT to see Disney films? It's what keeps us coming back time and time again. Plus it's a family film and made for all ages, not just adult audiences. I love the theme of good triumphing and lessons learned. There's so much negativity in the world, especially over this last year. So nice to see a film intended to uplift and bring people together in the end. It was not 100 % perfect but sure was close.",Raya and the Last Dragon
929,randyziegelman,Aesthetically pleasing Animation with incredible storytelling,8,6 March 2021,"Disney was very successful with the release of their latest film 'Raya and The Last Dragon.' This film was well worth the $30 payment to view it 3 months early. A great story of having trust in one another to make the world a better place! Taking place in an Asian culture, Raya must gather back the pieces of the Dragon Gem, with the help of some friends, to put life back into the world. This feature has so many lovable characters that it's hard to pick exactly who you enjoy the most. With an aesthetically pleasing animation style and a majority Asian cast this is set to be one of Disney's best for the foreseeable future. The story does the different parts of the nation justice as each part of the world is explored during a different part of the film. Each world greets you with a different scenic style and different creatures to keep you invested throughout the entire film. Every new part of the world Raya journeyed to kept the film feeling fresh and you never find yourself wondering when it would end. In fact, at the end of the film I wish it kept going on and now I find myself hoping for a sequel when I usually ask Disney to leave great films alone; "" Cough, Cough, "" Moana. They left the story open for an eventual sequel but this film would be fine without one as well. Awkwafina as Sisu was obviously the big star driving the ticket sales and she did a fantastic job as always however it can't go without saying that Kelly Marie Tran killed it in the lead role of Raya. Small shoutout is needed for her fellow co-star/rival Gemma Chan as Namari. This feature comes with an incredible life lesson as it pushes the notion of trust throughout. Trust is a major key ingredient in life that we all seem to be missing today. Whether it's a next door neighbor, your family, the nations leaders, or even ourselves, everyone seems to only be out for themselves nowadays and we as a nation need to trust each other and live as one to insure a more pleasing way of life. We may never achieve what Raya and The Last Dragon were teaching us as a culture to do but we can take lessons from it and grow as individuals. This movie was a home run and the only nod against it was the predictability throughout. This film gets a solid rating of 4.5/5 (8/10).",Raya and the Last Dragon
930,Amdeuxway,Isn't terrible but not good either,3,9 March 2021,"To start with the good, this movie is visually stunning and has great voice acting, however, I dislike Sisu's voice, her voice kinda annoying. The music is good, and the Plot is ok if you don't think about it too much, cuz it doesn't make too much sense, I think it's more suitable for kids. The character design looks ""okay"", not the best, I think Disney can do better. There are a few familiar scenes here and there... like from other movies. Character development wasn't that great, and the message of the movie is pretty terrible! Raya's sword, which she inherited from her dad, looks great! The sword design was cool but it wasn't utilized much in the movie. Weapons actually plays an important role in martial arts movie, they are the bread and butter of the martial artists. Maybe I've watched too many martial arts stuff and had high hopes in this one. Representation matters? Even though Raya is based on South East Asian Cultures, and I am from Malaysia, I still finding myself disliking Raya. If I need a ""role model"" to learn from, I will look up to real people doing something great, but not fictional characters, because they are from a fantasy world. However, I do enjoy watching movies with stories related to a real culture, like Coco, so I can explore new cultures thru animations. And not a mix of different cultures jammed into one movie. In Malaysia, we call this ""rojak"", a very popular dish with many different ingredients jammed into one. Conclusion: This movie isn't terrible, but it's not great either. I think the movie will be better if they get the right screenwriter, do more research from other action movies and fix the plot so it makes more sense. Not the typical it has to happen so just let it happen type of plot. The End.",Raya and the Last Dragon
931,Alenwen,The world needs more trust,8,17 July 2021,"It's a while ago already that a movie made me cry. This one got me. I didnt't like some parts (holy moly why does the dragon look like a crazy old witch in human form?, the voice was also unfitting, the baby team was over the top, lots of things predictable) but the message was beautifully delivered. Everyone should do the first step. We have so much hate in our world and some of us turned into stone aswell. I like the thought that it could be possible to do the same thing than Raya did. *dreams on*",Raya and the Last Dragon
932,the_aero23,Fun & Beautifully Animated,7,14 March 2021,"This is a good film. It's throughly entertaining & the animation is beautiful, it's probably Disney's best after Moana. This movie also works because it follows the Disney Formula well, but it's unique enough that it doesn't come off as generic.I did have one gripe with the movie though. The movie seemed to back off on showing the different unique cultures of Southeast Asia, and went for a more default version of it. I understand they did this so no one would be offended and complain about the depictions of each nation. This especially true after the backlash movies like Abominable, & even Disney's Mulan received.Overall the film is good, and has potential to be a Disney Classic.",Raya and the Last Dragon
933,fotinifofi,Better than I expected,8,7 March 2021,"This is the best Disney movie I have seen in a while. So many things could have been better of course, but there was too little time. The story was generic yes and we have seen plenty of that, but the movie still made anticipate and not want to take my eyes off of it. I would normally grade it 8 but I want to boost it so 9 it is.

The story line was compelling, the chemistry between the characters was fantastic, and there was something that both adults and kids could enjoy. A must see for any fantasy fans out there!

However, this film did exactly what I wanted it to do, it entertained me, my wife and our 8 year old daughter.There are no catchy songs but in this case I am glad as I don't think they would have worked. The film was enjoyable without the traditional sing song.It kept me engaged and entertained, it kept my wife off her phone and my daugher was hooked from start to finish.Under normal circumstances we would have probably gone to the cinema to watch it, so paying £20 to watch it on Premium view saved us money but i would have been happy to pay the cinema cost for this film.",Raya and the Last Dragon
936,gabriellenoelle,"Liked the movie, HATED the baby",6,26 June 2021,I actually liked the movie overall. It wasn't anything new but the graphics and cinematography were amazing. I also didn't mind the acting itself and liked the relationship that raya and sisu have. I felt that the characters could have been developed more so that we felt that they deserved a good ending but I didn't mind that they win in the end.My major issue with this movie is the baby. I know it's supposed to be comic relief but personally I hated it so much. They voice of the baby was really what grinder my gears. I think if it weren't for the baby I would have given this movie a higher score.Another issue I had was just a lack of depth within the story. For example why do the statues freeze in a certain way? Why did the dragons not unfreeze the first time but they do the second time. Nothing really feels earned in the movie and the whole story felt like a typical Disney plot but without the care that usually goes into the characters.,Raya and the Last Dragon

The humour isn't as cringy as I expected and actually made me laugh quite a few times. The story is alright, although not very complex, there is some good character development and the moral theme is well executed. In the end, a very good movie, I absolute loved watching it, and after all that's what I want in a good Disney movie, something that makes you feel good.",Raya and the Last Dragon

941,morenokiki,All the negative reviews are RIDICULOUS,7,24 April 2021,All the negative reviews seem like an over exaggeration as if everybody is all of a sudden an expert in storytelling or a disney animator. If you think you can do better please feel free to apply for a job at disney. The movie is beautiful visually and did a wonderful job at bringing to life to cultures and folklore that we haven't seen before. Was the storyline impeccable? No. But the exaggeration of how terrible it is just makes me think that everyone is just complaining to complain. If anything it felt like a lot of scenes were cut out maybe in order to meet the disney criteria. Watch it. Relax a little and just enjoy the movie for what it is. A visually stunning depiction of an array of SE asian cultures!,Raya and the Last Dragon

Everything from the Water Dragon (Nakara), hand-to-hand combat martial arts (MuayThai), to the culture...they even had durian (the stinky fruit you might have seen on Fear Factor).In this pandemic, I'm glad studios are still able to employ and put out great content for our enjoyment.

946,jeqcool,Fun characters but humor and emotions didn't land,7,6 June 2021,"I by no means think this is the worst Disney movie or even a bad movie at all. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, especially all the side ones and they're chemistry. The themes were praise worthy and the visuals were beautiful. However, as everyone has been saying, the humor really doesn't land and the emotional moments don't either. A lot of the times, when things went wrong, it was due to the poor decisions of the characters which never garners sympathy. I also really hated how forced the theme of ""trust"" was pushed. It was a bit too blatant which really does not land for me.However, I still had a lot of fun watching the movie and enjoyed the world building. I think children would very much enjoy it and it has a lot of redeeming qualities.",Raya and the Last Dragon
947,jag-86398,"Looks nice, but story is boring and messy",4,7 March 2021,"The movie looks great but there were so many weird decisions with the story. Humor was flat in many cases reminding me of 2010s vine humor where the joke is so on the nose its cringey and then the ""funny part"" is the person explaining the jokeCharacter development was non-existent and characters did whatever they wanted. In one scene you had a ninja baby that could sneak through an entire city and take out guards to leave a note, followed by the main character having a realistic MMA fight with the villian. No coherence between scenes but hey look cute baby face",Raya and the Last Dragon
948,robinasandhu,I loved this movie,10,21 June 2021,People saying bad stuff didn't get what the movie was trying to show. It showed that in order to trust someone you have to give trust first.

There's a story plot twist, a map, back story and etc. Ye to all gamers out there this would be an awesome ""Short story game play"". If i can see it, then all else will follow this idea soon.

951,Greensphere4049,IMPORTANT: READ BEFORE WATCHING,5,14 May 2021,"Most people on here are mad simply because of disney plus having to pay 30 bucks to see the movie. It is quite expensive, but that is ""for some reason"" The reason why people hate it. But if you really want to know what makes it good, and bad. So here is a short pro/con::Cons:The movie has some unoriginality and is predictable.The story is a little bland.The dragon could be annoying to some, but not Jar Jar Binks bad.Flat characters.Pros:It has the typical ""dream team"" of characters. But this one is actually different and creative.It has a good lesson.The protagonist has not a lot of development but you can actually care about them.The animation is beautiful and solid voice acting.Overall if you want something like Zootopia or Big hero six I don't recommend at all, but if you have nothing better to do really, and just want to watch a new movie this one could be an option.",Raya and the Last Dragon
952,hayleprincesswinter,Culturally insensitive,7,31 March 2021,"I'm southeast asian and considering the initial theme of the movie is, well, southeast asia, what they basically did was mash all southeast asian cultures together in means of ""representation"".Anyone with common sense would know that this is culturally insensitive.

953,RayBonesMiaBeach,"Fun for the whole family. Disney nailed it, yet again!",10,8 April 2021,"Another homerun by Disney.I have two daughters (10 & 5) and very much appreciate a quality cinematic experience with a young girl as the hero - especially when it's more than just a cliché of woke-speak, propaganda, nonsense.You must see the film on a big screen, in a theater with quality digital sound to truly appreciate the overall scope and production value of the film.The story is nothing revolutionary or ground-breaking. And, yes, it is fairly predictable, but that's a terribly lame critique. It's a Disney movie! How could you possibly think the good guys would NOT eventually triumph? And if you find that disappointing, that's clearly a ""you"" problem.In spite of any predictability, the story still manages to effectively incorporate action (there are great martial arts fighting scenes - I would imagine those are not easy to animate), betrayal, commitment, redemption and much more. The climactic battle delivers an emotionally powerful and satisfying conclusion to the 3rd act.I look forward to the inevitable repeated showings that my daughters will surely demand we watch (on the Disney+ app). I don't imagine growing tired of this film anytime soon.And just for clarification, that which I have written here is a review based almost entirely on observing, and then discussing with them, my daughters' reaction to the film. After all, unless I am mistaken, young children are the demographic for these films.Keep that in mind if you read any negative review of this film. It will most likely have been written by an adult, or in other words, someone who was not the primarily intended audience.

Disney broke new ground for itself producing a film focused on southeast Asian folklore that, to my white male experience, seemed really well done. Characters clashed using Muay Thai, used the traditional greeting which translates to ""have you eaten yet?"", and the story was set in a gorgeous Mekong-style world. Everything was polished to the highest standard. My one issue was that I was not surprised by any moment in the movie, which admittedly was not written to serve me. It was like a highly scored gymnastic routine, where every beat was expected but also accomplished with impeccable skill. I don't regret paying extra for my family to see this movie, and I expect to watch it again multiple times in the coming months, before it becomes available to all Disney+ subscribers.

So are they the villain of this movie? Did they get punishment for what did to people and world? Did they even mention sorry or intend to appologize?I think this is what this movie lacks of .

963,mousehugger-70425,Better than expected,9,13 March 2021,"Going into this movie I expected it to be good but not great. Relying heavily in the stunning visuals to carry the movie for critical viewers, but I was pleasantly surprised.
First thing I'm going to say is that I rate kid/family movies on a different scale. If this wasn't a family movie I would give it a 5 maybe a 6 out if 10. Visually stunning, amazing music, but not a lot of in-depth development. But the thing is it's a kids movie. Which means it gets a pass for being a bit predictable and less subtle.
Now for my full opinion. I loved this movie. It was cute and inspiring. Yes I sat and watched and was able to predict half of the stuff but there were moments that caught me off guard. Things didnt play out exactly how I was guessing (but similar). Some things were a little in your face especially the humor. The baby and the kid they meet for example, but I think that if I was a kid I would love those characters. They were cute and fun and I think they each had an important part but the movie didn't have enough time or depth to truly develope them. This movie had a strong found family based story and that's what I loved. Each one shared a loss and didn't trust one another but they found each other and became a family. That's what the movie was about. And I think for the length of this movie they did a good job. I related to a lot of the characters and found myself invested into what happened to them.
A lot of people are saying it follows the same formula as every Disney movie and I'll agree partly. Every popular movie franchise has been following a formula and it's been successful for them so they arnt going to stop. This movie though I think followed a classic formula but wasn't exactly the same. There wasn't a classic villain but instead a problem born out of negative humanity. In the beginning they set it up to have the fang as the true enemy they had to fight but instead it was a misunderstanding and distrust. Unable to see things from another perspective is why they were against each other and that's why I'm waiting it highly. This was a relatable and great part of the movie. And no one wasnt guilt of playing a part. Raya the main character assumed things and distrusted as a first instinct. She had to learn to trust and to have faith in other people.Sorry for the length. But just to sum up. This movie was great because the villain wasnt a person or a character but a part of all of them. The distrust and assumptions they had. And in order to fix the problem they had to have faith in people that had betrayed them and didn't know. To look at things from another perspective and to take the first step.It lost one star from me because there was a lot of subtle hints and implying things that didn't happen that I think would have just made this movie even greater but it would have been risky for Disney so they didn't. (My personal opinion)",Raya and the Last Dragon

Seeing how there was literally ten writers and four directors working on an hour long movie....you can kind of see how this movie got so tangled up in its own plot holes, flat characters and kung fu 'boss baby' jokes.Felt more like I was watching the writers of this film play the telephone game, as they pitched ideas back and forth than I was watching a complete, polished film.
Which is shocking to me cause... its disney! I really was hoping the film would feel sincere and epic but instead was given an elsa, my little pony -friendship is magic hybrid of a movie.Not gonna lie disney....you charging people 30 dollars up front PLUS a monthly subscription fee is pretty awful and corporate cold of you to do. And that's what this movie felt like! Just a poorly sewn elsa dragon plush doll smashed up against the glass of a crane machine in the middle of nowhere.So if your a parent who thinks 'cartoons' are just for kids and want to distract your own kid for an hour while you get the laundry done-This movies for you.

First raya searches for last dragon then she somewhat has a selfish motive to revive her ba(dad) but with the period of time she learns that she must have to protect all and develop trust on other people to save the world.Just try to watch it with ur soul in,how beautiful it is.

The writing in Raya and the last dragon is very poor, the story is predictable as it gets and the villans are bad just because, there is no background no motive, it makes me wonder what is making them act like that and the movie is not explaining or giving me any clues. The script is filled with deus ex machina, when something happens just for the convenience of the script and not because is reasonable or makes any sense. Now the dragon, one of the main characters, i expected it to be introduced late in the movie and imagined a very big moment with a explosions of color and a majestic dragon emerging from the water, none of that happened instead you get an insufrible annoying ""dragon"" with the personality of a teenager that tries to be funny and fails miserably.

987,garciajahredi,DISNEY AT ITS FINEST!!,10,5 March 2021,"Definitely an eye opener! 🌎🌍🌏Disney did a fair amount of research. Similar to Moana, Disney created what they call a ""Story Trust"" of artists, academics, and others, which they leaned on for issues of cultural accuracy. The team visited Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Screenwriters Adele Lim and Qui Nguyen are both Southeast Asian, as is Kelly Marie Tran who voices Raya. But there's the fact that most of the other voice actors - a packed roster of talent that includes Gemma Chan, Daniel Dae Kim, Awkwafina, and Sandra Oh - are East Asian. And because Kumandra is a ""fantasy"" world drawing from a number of different countries in a larger region, it risks blurring cultural references to the point where they become unrecognizable or incoherent to the people who expected to identify with the movie.",Raya and the Last Dragon
988,tudorbarratt,Boring Plot and Annoying Characters,2,4 June 2021,"This movie (as the title suggests) has an extremely boring and basic plot. At no point in this movie was I remotely captivated by what was occuring, the pacing felt extremely odd and it felt like there were a lot of missed oppurtunities for interesting events. The characters were also very uninteresting, they were extremely 2 dimensional with no interesting aspects, the only character I know by name is Raya and that is because of the films title and not any interesting aspects of her character.The most egregious part of this movie though is the dragon. The dragon is an unfunny, annoying shell of a character. It's hard to explain in words how awfully the character is written and performed. I've not even mentioned the fact that there are no original songs, this wouldn't be a problem for most films but for a Disney film this is a problem as they are a core part of the companies movies.The only positive I have for this movie is that it is visually stunning. The art direction taken is the best aspect of the film everything about the animation is beautiful and the set locations are really unique and interesting (a shame the plot wasn't the same).",Raya and the Last Dragon

992,ajpjedi,My new favriote Disney Movie.,10,16 May 2021,"Cons: A little bit of a cliche story, one joke went on for too long, whats with all the jerky hate, I love jerky, and I wish that Joauqin Pheniox's Joker was the villian. Pros: Literally evreything else! The acting is suprisingy great, I mean it's not the best I've ever heard but not evreyone can be a Heath Ledger in the acting department. All of the charictars (including the dragon and that mutant baby whom I'm convinced is related to wolverine and no one can convince me otherwise) Are all loveable or hateable depending on what their going for. I really like the ending and I will admit, it almost got a 15 year old doritos eating gamer to cry. (Okay thats a lie, I don't eat doritos). I really like the message about having faith in people. And the music, HOLY CHAD THE MUSIC!!!!! I also loved the Avatar asthetic it was going for and I really liked all of the bonds formed by the crew. Personally I found this to be a right old good time, the main complaints are valid, but I say ignore them and give this film a shot. You will hopefully love this film as much as I did. But if not, that's perfectally fine, I'm not you. OR AM I? But seriously, if Raya has never had terryaki jerky, clearly

The actions in this movie is also pretty tight like the hand to hand combat, the sword play, etc. And the what's even more impressive about this movie is that it was animated from home.

Really?Spoilers: Honestly, the blind trust was just ridiculous. The main character's father made a horrible decision in trusting the wrong people then his daughter turns around and trusts the wrong people in the end of the movie and it just... Works out? That's dumb. The Fang had a right to be worried about being tried for War Crimes because they were GUILTY of War Crimes. The leaders of Fang should have been arrested and tried. The leaders of the other villages should have paid restitution to Heart for stealing the gem and causing Heart's and the world's destruction. They brought about the apocalypse for goodness sake!

1004,joshub-96412,Beautiful and flawed,6,23 March 2021,"Raya and the last dragon is a very well paced, visually pleasing joyride that lives up to the current Disney standard of fun, but underwhelming. The best way I could describe this movie is to say that it's like moana and avatar the last air bender had a child. The world building is fascinating, but it's a little obvious how much they borrowed from the far superior tv show; not to mention the basic backstory/plot is fundamentally the same. I have to give credit to the stunning visuals and the refreshing cast of southeast Asian actors who really kill it in this movie. It's good to see Kelly Marie Tran (sorry if I spelled that wrong) play such a strong and likable character after her debut in the Star Wars franchise came out so awful. The cast is brilliant, and almost perfect... which brings me to the Achilles heel of the movie. The dragon. The primary side character of the movie played by the well known celebrity and comedian awkwafina is absolutely atrocious. First of all, the dragon design is maybe the worst thing I've ever seen. It wouldn't surprise me if they hired actual 8 year olds to do the character design on the dragons. But the main dragon, who I can't remember the name of is easily the worst part of the movie. With constant modernized and honestly cringe worthy jokes that completely take you out of the scene, it's impossible to have a meaningful moment with this character involved. I never thought I would be unironically laughing at an animated Disney original film like this. It honestly made me sad. This movie has so much potential, and choices like this are what hold it back from being an 8 or 9 out of ten. The theme of the film is really well done in some aspects, and while it does come off a little heavy handed, it really delivers in the end. By simply tweaking a couple scenes or lines of dialogue, this film would have a very powerful message about trust, forgiveness, and grief. However, without spoiling anything, it is worth mentioning that the film really lacks lasting stakes. While the film is about saving the world, you never feel that the characters are ever in any actual danger, and the ending of the movie certainly doesn't help with that. Long story short- you take the dragon out and you develop the side characters more, or you completely rework the dragon(s), and remove some of the side characters, you have yourself a moana level Disney film. I want to give it a 6.5, but I think it's safer to round down rather than up. 6/10 good potential",Raya and the Last Dragon

1013,nsvqudiq,Great new Disney princess,10,6 March 2021,"Well done, Disney.
Raya and the last dragon is a great movie, that imo kids and adults alike will be able to enjoy. The plot and jokes feel a lot like the other latest princess-movies, i.e. Frozen, Moana or Tangled. And maybe with a mix of Avatar: the Legend of Korra (especially with the baby+monkeys).The animations and graphics in general are just breathtaking. I mean - you can even see fine age lines on their faces in some sequences - and the special effects - incredible!! We really have come along way here.The story itself is kind of predictable, I will have to agree with the critics. But honestly? The plot is predictable in every Disney movie ^^ Tangled for example - she is the lost princess, main-guy falls in love with main-girl, villain/""mother"" will be mad and try to stop her, betrayal, hurt, drama, good wins, girl goes home where everything is perfect, guy gets girl.
Therefore, predictable is what you're signing up for when you're watching a traditional Disney movie. Not everything from Disney can be as story-rich as with its Marvel or StarWars movies ;)
But what makes these traditional movies great are the diverse characters, their relationships, the character-depth and -growth, the message and meaning behind it, and of course the funny jokes and situations. And that you can just relax, laugh, and enjoy 2h of not-pandemic-related drama :)Raya is a great new Disney princess. I love how strong and independent she is portrayed in the movie. Sure, she's flawed as well, but everyone is. And she does make the right call in the end.
I wish I was able to see a role-model like her in cinemas when I was a young girl. If you have a daughter, go watch Raya with her!So yeah. I can fully recommend the movie. Enjoy.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The characters didn't really touch me, the story was somehow weird and the plot not so much surprising. There was one joke that made me laugh, all the others were flat like pancakes.The graphics were indeed amazing, that's why I'm willing to give 4 stars. Except for the dragons, they appeared cheap to me, am I the only one?It seems the scriptwriters suffered from a coronaesque depression while the animation guys were peeking in performance while working from home.

It feels like they tried to cram a 5/6 episode miniseries into a 2 hour movie. Because it's so rushed you don't really get to know the characters very well, which there are too many of for a movie this short in my opinion. Now of course, it would be way too expensive to make an animated show of this visual grade, but I think it would've been better like that in this case. The first thing I thought when I was halfway through the movie was: ""This really just feels like Disney is applying for a artistic animation job and this their portfolio""But heck, even after that I loved this movie and it only gets better upon watching it multiple times.

Raya is a strong female lead, the supporting characters were likeable and fun, and although there were some holes in the story, the themes of family (the one you're born into AND the one you choose), forgiveness and trust, bravery and community were all pretty uplifting in these times. But what I loved the most is Disney (finally) featuring Asian / Southeast Asian culture in a gorgeous, colourful, and vibrant animated movie. I never thought I'd see the day when Disney could make princesses and characters that look like me, my friends, my daughter. Yes, Mulan and Moana came before Raya but somehow, the Tomb-Raider meets Indiana Jones meets Souteast Asia tropical vibe .. feels current and cool. And Asian details like congee! Loved it!

Annnnddd idk HOOWW much character development these people want. It gave us just what we needed to not be lost. Anything more would have made the movie too long and boring. As for being afraid of having a bad guy? Look, the world has had ENOUGH BAD to last us the rest of our lifetimes... please just watch the movie and enjoy the goodness that it serves..it's truly beautiful if you watch it without the intent to hate everything good left in the world...it'll only be bad if you have no hope or love left in your heart.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1041,ronygasu,After a long time I saw a satisfied movie.,10,15 March 2021,"When I started watching the movie, I felt like I was a character in that movie,The movie proved that cinema is not just a food for entertainment but also an educational subject.I don't have any bad comments about the movie, I just want to say one thing, the movie deserves an Oscar.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1042,TriggerIn3D,I enjoyed this movie. Minor flaws but overall great..,8,15 March 2021,"Beautifully shot movie. The animation was excellent. Some of the scenes just made me so happy.As far as the story goes, as an adult, I would've liked more character development but I'm sure this movie was meant for children and with that in mind the development level they used was perfect. Characters were likeable and funny. Plot made sense and I especially loved that it wasn't the cliched ""princess looking for romantic love"" story that's been overused for ages. Great moral of the story too.Accents sounded caucasian. Not a big deal just had me confused coz it was clearly an asian movie. Cast showed actors/actresses were asian.Huge plus was no annoying songs mid movie.Would definitely watch again with kids.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The locations and the dramatic cinematic movement is so good. And the spirtual story is very motivational.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1044,digrandim,"Lazy writing, even for Disney.",5,16 March 2021,"The moment you hear the trailer quote ""Our world is so divided"" you will be able to predict every single trope throughout this hot mess of a film.1.) Stop assuming we'll immediately empathize and root for the protagonist without understanding a hint of context. It's going to take more than a warrior-princess archetype, pop-culture dialogue, and special effects to instill a sense of investment in the main character.2.) So, ""division"" is the main driving conflict device. Not knightly vengeance. Not long-lost-love. Not even something as vague as ""justice"".
Just a natural delineation of different kingdoms.3.) Naturalistic monsters make for shallow antagonists.",Raya and the Last Dragon

It is a shame because it could have been a lot more.

1051,shwetamaniwade,STUPID WRITING AND STORY WITH PRETTY VISUALS,1,18 March 2021,DONT WATCH. IT HAS A REALLY STUPID STORY.Raya makes a really stupid mistake of trusting someone she just met.These movie makers nowadays think they can make a movie with pretty visuals and bad writing and people are going to still watch ?Please do not watch this movie. It should flop. Not expected from Disney.,Raya and the Last Dragon
1052,aatatroe,Disney Hater Really Enjoyed It,9,20 March 2021,"I'm not a fan of most things disney, but I really enjoyed this film. Made me cry. It was visually beautiful and the characters I found to be pretty interesting. It also didn't rely on musical numbers which was a breath of fresh air. Over all the story line was not what I expected but it was fun and full of heart. I honestly really liked this film a lot. And of course I loved tuk tuk. 20/10 for tuk tuk.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1053,deb_nona,Original and one fo the best ever made,10,20 March 2021,I say this because it for once isn't a white washed piece and focuses on a story that is completely original and unique.I feel it can't be a coincidence that all critics who are white seem to dislike the movie. This is an important piece that shows women from minority backgrounds that they can be strong and courageous. The overall moral of the story is also beautiful and I fear all critics completely missed the plot.Very memorable and admirable movie. Can't wait to watch it again.,Raya and the Last Dragon
1054,mthorne-09994,Surprised I liked it,10,21 March 2021,"I didn't expect that I would like this movie, but I watched with my wife and we loved it. The has a very Asian feel, specifically Thailand.

1056,df_snyder,"Amazing, but Disney needs new endings",9,22 March 2021,"I know when it comes to these movies it's for the younger audience, and with that being said, I still feel as if everyone being happy in the end isn't always the message needed. And straying away can still be effective and teach new lessons. The movie was stunning! Every last part of it! One thing I was really hoping for was an ending where Raya pieced the stone back together and gave a self sacrifice turning herself into stone to allow the humans and dragons to all come back. Showing ""heart"" (get it) and selflessness. And after her sacrifice it could cut to the heart village where everyone is surrounding the temple where the gem was first seen, and in its place was raya turned to stone. It pans to her father smiling and places a flower in her palms and as he does so, he proclaims ""I'm so proud of you my rain drop. Her nickname if I recall correctly. And then everyone puts their hands over their heads. And the dragons drop their heads in respects. And raya who once broke the world, has now brought it back together",Raya and the Last Dragon

And uplifting southeast asian cultures is such a plus for me, so much loveeeas a southeast Asian people I love how this movie show that Asian isn't just about japan, korean and china. also how the message is what we really need now that's about unity in diversity. its a warm movie to watch with your family. remember animation isn't always about kids.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1058,stuartjm-29714,Gorgeous Visuals!,7,23 March 2021,"Sunday I went to watch ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" with my friends. I didn't know what to expect with this movie because I hadn't seen many trailers, but, I was nevertheless excited to see Disney's latest movie (especially since Disney seemed to take a more mature path with this movie.) ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" is unlike many Disney movies out today. It is not a musical so there are no catchy songs that will get stuck in your head. It has sword fights -- you don't see many of these in Disney movies -- and it has the newer animation style and graphics that were featured in the movie ""Moana,"" just better. ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" is truly a visual masterpiece. The dragons were gorgeous and the water was realistic, the visuals were *chefs kiss* and I will definitely be watching the movie again, this time with my nieces and nephews. I only wish they designed a dragon to look like Mushu!",Raya and the Last Dragon
1059,scootesmcgootes,Nothing new,3,24 March 2021,"The movie has a good premise but falls prey to some quick corporate friendly jokes and overall shallow character development. It almost feels like they made a great movie with a rich, mature story and then were told to ""make things more relatable"". As usual though the animation is amazing from the Disney VFX team.I wouldn't recommend paying money to see this.",Raya and the Last Dragon

1062,ninsabella,We enjoyed it,8,26 March 2021,"I have to be honest--I was definitely a little disappointed in reading all the negative reviews. So much so, that it prompted me to write one myself. I really liked the movie, and so did my little girl. The visuals were outstanding. More so, I thought the message of hope was one that we all need to hear. I like that Disney is starting to incorporate the idea that there isn't really good vs evil--but different perspectives. Much of the division that we see comes from not understanding the big picture, lack of empathy or not seeing things through someone else's eyes--compounded fear and mistrust over time. I commend Disney for addressing such powerful and relevant topics in such a cute and visually appealing way.",Raya and the Last Dragon

1068,felixfelices-53581,Dreadful Movie,2,19 April 2021,"I was really excited for this movie's release and had very high hopes, but this movie did not uphold any of my expectations. In fact, it was absolutely painful to watch.The plot is bland with predictable twists, and the ending is...a really bad attempt at tear-jerking or suspense. Did not fool me for a second. The characters bend to fit the unnatural plot and lack any sort of consistency whatsoever. And the message they were trying to convey kept confusing me.The characters are awful. Even Raya, the titular character, has hurried development, acting like a surly fend-for-myself kind of girl towards the beginning, and then toward the end magically becomes trusting. I won't say there's nothing, but it definitely felt abrupt. And Sisu! Where to begin. My skin crawled every time Sisu spoke. She seems like a kind of Maui-knockoff from Moana due to her attempted ""swag"" or whatever. She spends more time cracking meaningless jokes than contributing to the story, and she looks like she's in the wrong movie.The most I can say of this is that the animation is quite nice. Very realistic. But that's the most I can say.Honestly, Disney - you need to stop making the same film over and over again with different characters. That's what Raya and the Last Dragon is - a copy of countless other movies that came before. People are going to get tired. They have gotten tired.If you're thinking about watching this movie, I won't stop you, but it's really quite bad.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1069,miketimm-24522,Great message and memorable characters,10,25 April 2021,This film captured my 5 year old daughter's imagination and kept the adults interested. Worth the preorder.,Raya and the Last Dragon
1070,mpagem-34047,"Beautiful visuals, terrible dragon.",3,25 April 2021,"The story was very predictable and gave a plot line similar to that of a marvel rip off combined with a team-gathering heist movie. However, the worst part was the dragon. Every time she talked it made my head hurt. It was a bad voice actress combined with terrible writing. The animation was awesome and I wish it was complimented by good character development and a refreshing story, but that was not the case.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1071,joeclinibida,One of the best from Disney,10,20 July 2021,This was great and I loved every moment of it. The diversity of different ages shows you are not too young or old to save yourself from doom.,Raya and the Last Dragon

My intentions were to take a nap while my children were occupied with the movie but I never dozed off. It definitely had me emotional and the cast had me laughing with the side jokes. I'm so glad I had a chance to see this!!!,Raya and the Last Dragon
1075,ninadketkar,Very Predictable,7,6 June 2021,"I had been waiting for this movie to come to Disney+ for a long time. But when I saw it, I was kind of disappointed. The start was good, but then the rest of the movie felt too rushed. It felt like Raya's mission was just too easy. And the movie was also predictable.The only thing I liked about the movie was the concept. The various kingdoms having different cultures and themes was an awseome idea. Another thing I liked was the animation. The characters felt natural and the atmosphere of the movie made it a little better to watch.So overall, I think Raya and the last dragon was good, but it could have been better.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1076,innocentiousxii,TERRIBLE story - Great visuals,2,15 May 2021,"I would rate this lower but the visuals knocked it up a star...Why such a terrible score for such a beautiful movie? Its because no matter how awesome the animation or actually in part because of the awesome animation the show just falls flat on its face from the get go from a story perspective.Within the first 5 minutes of exposition you are told what will happen in the rest of the movie. Which could be forgiven if the story line was strong enough. Seriously we all knew Odysseus was going to make it home. His tales of adventure were what kept us enthralled.BUT in this show you do not have that. The problem ( people don't trust each other ) and cause a super natural calamity to occur which threatens their continued existence and in the end can only be overcome by 'trust' and reuniting what was broken. Which ACTUALLY could have been a REALLY good story line, if not for the acting, spurious character development, flat dialog, and in general poor execution.Since you know what is going to happen just from the first 10 minutes of the movie I am going to explain WHY the show is just... Terrible which means spoilers... So stop reading here if you want to go and see this waste of an hour and forty minutes.1 ) the dragon gem is broken due to the greed of the fragmented nation.2 ) Terrible invincible monsters are unleashed that turn everyone to stone ( you cannot fight them but the shards of the dragon gem keep them at bay ) oh and they cannot travel on water - phew a way to stay safe, why water? WHO KNOWS can you say PLOT DEVICE.3 ) Raya reawakens a dragon who defeated the monsters before ( how? Unclear but she figured it out, only the dragon didn't even know it wasn't around? ) - Honestly the 6 year adventure to find the dragon would have probably been a better story line then what ended up in the movie - Oh can I smell a Disney cartoon spin off?4 ) Said dragon is a screw up, naive, but in the end wise? ""Just give gifts and others will love you!""
5 ) Journey to collect the shards of the Dragon Gem begin ( why was the dragon needed? )
6 ) First shard found - taken from a dead person who NO ONE ELSE would have thought to collect - Only Raya after 6 years of searching for the dragon thought to collect once the dragon was back.7 ) Oh the person who betrayed her and caused the calamity in the first place is coming after her - because she stole something - oh great character - P. S. She is planning to steal back the dragon heart shards from others - you know since they had taken them from her 'people' in the first place...
8 ) phew escaped on a boat with a child captain/restaurant owner? First wacky character with 1 degree of character development ( and honestly he is one of the ones WITH character development )
9 ) go to the next place - baby and monkeys who are ridiculous join next after stealing the 2 dragon shards that Raya has.10 ) Raya steals the next piece from an old woman who ironically was protecting her village from a dragon ( in human form ) who was taking peoples stuff ( out of ignorance so it is forgivable 'it was on credit' ) BUT the old woman wanted the other shards so its fine that Raya takes hers instead.11 ) Next shard - the dragon says be nice and ends up captured with Raya by a man who acts mean but is actually lonely because everyone in his village has been turned to STONE!!! But they turn the tables on him and then he joins while the original betrayer fights Raya but is enchanted and then questions everything because the Dragon appears before her - so you know - she was not bad in the first place.12 ) So now we have a group of people together and one last shard to be obtained ( the lonely guy and the others find out about the dragon and decide to join together to fix the world ) Since you know - who would want it to stay broken when you have supernatural creatures turning people to stone? BUT how to do it how to do it...
13 ) Steal or ask for the last stone... Well the dragon says ask, so they do. Dragon gets shot and ?dies/disappears? Along with all water... I mean she was a water dragon don't you know and so while the earth did not disappear when the earth dragon was turned to stone 500 years before when the water dragon goes away all water just poofs away - now nothing can hold back the monsters!!! All heck breaks lose but the various companions ( oh which just HAPPEN to ultimately be one from each 'tribe' ) join together and trust the one person who betrayed them all. WHICH FIXES EVERYTHING in the ONE and I mean ONE place where you feel any attachment to any of the characters!The acting fell flat, the dialogue was not good, the story was preachy in a way that 20 years from now when we look back will give you the heebie jeebies since the world is a little more complicated then joining together against a group of supernatural monsters that can only be kept at bay by a mystical gem - oh and water - why water - the last dragon of course?!?! Maybe.The plot holes in this movie and the required suspension of belief based on the SOTRYLINE ITSELF are SO LARGE!!!For instance! At one point in a flashback moment, it shows the dragons being on the ground and surrounded by the monsters but once the world is restored they are all flying around and carefree, why they could not have escaped into the air, found a good place ( like an island surrounded by water since the creatures cannot touch water ) to figure out the magic and then fought the creatures before with the magic gem they created? BECAUSE OF THE PLOT - DUH.I swear all the actors worked from home, I have watched a few shows where this was the case and in all of them they come away with almost the same disjointed feel of not being quite - there. It sucks.The story was disjointed - the Odyssey fell flat - the characters where shallow - the motivations poorly explained - the reactions against each other - shallow - the resolution contrived.I feel bad for the people who liked this movie, have they not seen good movies? Are they enchanted by the visuals ( which were great by the way - BUT THAT MAKES THE LACK OF STORY THAT MUCH WORSE!!! ) What was great about this? Seriously. It was so badly executed! It could have been GREAT but it needed work. It almost felt like they said - get it out! The visuals will cover up the story!",Raya and the Last Dragon
1077,TotoTats16,Another Average Princess Movie,2,26 May 2021,"An average Disney movie with pretty animation and good fight choreography. The message of the movie was poorly executed through Raya constantly telling the characters instead of showing it. It's also toxic since 2 characters acted like Raya was to blame. Sisu's design looks out of place, and her voice was unbearable at times. The humor was a hit or miss and sometimes took away the serious tone of the movie. The characters needed to be fleshed out more, but I loved Boun. This would've been better off as a tv series. The contemporary dialogue was so annoying and took the immersion out of the fantasy setting. The pacing also feels too fast since you don't get to take in the different tribes. It's like a video game where Raya has to collect MacGuffins with no problems while bringing people that tag along.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1078,markfox-23605,"Amazing Story, and meaningful message",10,20 May 2021,"When I saw a bit of this movie, at first I was uncertain, but as the movie goes is to trust one another.Was certainly different of disney movies, no sing along, not predictable. I think its good progress!,What the hero faced was different but inspiring. The ""villain"" didn't talk sure, but not all villains need to speak, including when it became a manifestation of greed and war. I felt it was very good in terms of how the enemy was not putting trust in others.I know that not everyone does that in real life, but its a disney movie for ya. Its not a dumb one. Nor does it turn it into a shut your brain off and watch. I think it is thought provoking.I give it a 10 star because I enjoyed the world of the movie. Amazing artistic inspiration. While it is a bit silly to see the map of the world be shaped into a dragon, I find it so cool that the guys who put the backs into the movie!Give this movie a chance!",Raya and the Last Dragon
1079,decdec-40424,I couldn't believe what I just watched?,2,21 May 2021,"No, seriously, this is like something I never expected from a Disney movie, far worse than Frozen. First of all, let me tell you how much hype I got for this movie, this is like first time Asian cultured foundation Disney has ever made (not Mulan, it's Chinese kind of Asian). So it's a super hype there.And then comes Raya, the main actress, with a very usual warrior background, followed by a riddiculous betrayal that ignited the main story, same as Anna from Frozen but it's WAY worse.And the main story is like when you havent eat McDonald's meal for years and you got a whole plate in front of you. You didn't really care how it brought out to you, you just always know that it's good. BUT IT'S NOT.When I watch this the first time, I can't find what's wrong and what's right here. Everything is just having their own choices without a circulation point. I can't blame ANYONE. The story is just gonna left you out blindly straight to the end. Only with a superior level of visuals. To keep you entertained. With a boring dialogues. Ewh.And the worst are the characters!Raya looks like a badass at the first encounter. But she became so irregular and unbalance as the story goes.AND BY GOODNESS, WHY BRINGING BACK BA WAS HER ONLY OBJECTIVE?? This wish of her is getting much annoying since the disaster happened to the whole world!The other characters are lame, flat, less motivated, and its more on grief than the spirit to fight.And the worse is the baby. Yeah I preferred Jack-Jack way better, and you can't redo him just because you have a toddler character. The baby fits more as a villain, i guess, i mean his agility overpassed Raya. The warrior. And he is also sent to the last palace, all by himself, while the others are just... ugh.If you wanna watch this movie, bring your toddler or at least one 10 or less aged kid to the show. So you don't have to walk out knowing you didn't get anything much than a laugh at the scene where... I don't even know what is funny here. I'm asian, I know my joke. And this movie brings nothing out of it, just a plain background.",Raya and the Last Dragon

This movie really empowered me to move on with my life.The graphic and the music are phenomena! I'm deeply surprise by the emotions I can read from eyes and face of every single person or dragon in the movie. And when Raya hug the dragon, I want to do it too to feel the fluffiness of the fur! Also when the graphics was accompanied with the epic background music, I was dragged into that world. I am so glad to view all those different landscapes when I cannot travel.The story is simple, but I do not expect to consumer too much mental power while watching these Disney movies. I was looking for fantasies in which good people and good sprites win, and I have it with Raya and the Last Dragon.",Raya and the Last Dragon

Pass--sure glad I didn't pay for premier access on this one.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1092,davenlp,Great Potential. Lacking in Execution,3,7 June 2021,"Let me start by saying when I saw the trailer for this I was ecstatic! Dragons, martial arts, and the world is torn; sign me up.The lore behind the movie is interesting however it isn't really expanded upon fully. Once you get through the first 30 minutes it's collect a gem, go to a new place and do it again. Each new character brought in has like 1 minute to explain their background and that's it. The real characters you kinda feel anything for is Raya and Namaari (could be wrong about the name). Everyone else is pretty much just a waste of space.Don't let me get started with Aqwafina as the dragon. I haven't been a fan of her in anything I've seen I've seen and at this point I doubt I ever will.This isn't your typical Disney movie with the catchy music that the kids usually love. In fact I'm 90% sure that there isn't a single song whatsoever.I got about 3/4 of the movie and fell asleep and woke up at the end. I'm glad I waited for this to come out of Disney Plus without having to pay for it, because I would've been upset.",Raya and the Last Dragon

I was so excited about it, so much so that my disappointment has led me here, to write my first IMBD review! Visually, Raya is fun, and there are a few cute moments. That said, I found myself looking out the window more than once, really ready for it to end.For parents of young children: I found there to be an unnecessary amount of violence/fighting sequences in this movie.

Beautiful scenery and animation, solid storyline, pretty good characters, but the thing that knocks this review down to 7 stars is some of the dragon's lines. Susu's a pretty good character, but she has her... moments. Like when she first turned into a human or the way she would try to say slang-like words. There were some pretty good moments with her too, though. The little boy was cute and so was the baby and the monkeys and I really liked Raya's character arc and overall character. There were definitely some bad moments, but overall pretty good movie.",Raya and the Last Dragon

1104,kyrakat-42993,"Beautiful, but a bit predictable",8,3 July 2021,"Overall, this movie was a visual masterpiece and included an eclectic group of characters with an impressive cast.The story itself was your traditional adventure and ""find the thing, get the goal"" movie. You could easily guess what was going to happen in each new location (get a new member of the team, narrowly escape with the next dragon piece) and unfortunately lacked much development or actual pacing.To me, the biggest downfall to this movie is simply its writing. I fully understand that doing movies like this WILL leave themselves susceptible to the same recycled plot, but it would have been nice to see a new spin on this type of story. In addition, the antagonists did not lend much to the plot and the ending seemed a little bit too ""easy"" and concluded very quickly.However, all of this being said for critiques, there were parts of the movie that are genuinely worth watching it for. Obviously, the movie is jaw-dropping from a visual aspect. No detail was spared and the movements of each character, environment, and effect was beyond realistic and impressed me to no end (body language when there was no dialogue was one of my favorite things from this). The soundtrack too was a major plus and added so much to scenes that felt a little dull on their own. The chemistry between the characters and the cast helped this movie flow smoother as well. Some of the characters I genuinely enjoyed and felt would've changed the whole vibe of the movie had they not been there, while others felt thrown in to make the team feel more ""ragtag"".Raya herself was a wonderfully powerful and independent character, but it's arguable that she strayed from her character's motives and personality a few times throughout the movie. Shushi's writing was one of the least impressive to me, and was almost exclusively used for comic relief - often in times that felt inappropriate for such.The last thing I would like to mention is the character design and attention to culture - both of which heavily delivered. The silhouettes of each character balanced well with one another and no scene felt clunky or crowded. The attention to detail in architecture, clothing, hair, weaponry, and more was also wonderful and it was nice to see a nice change of pace from commonly European-style landscaping (granted, this is due to the nature of many retold Brothers Grimm stories).Overall, it's enjoyable and worth the watch, but don't get your hopes up to see something completely new and groundbreaking in the movie industry. People also seem to be forgetting that this movie was created almost ENTIRELY during the COVID-19 pandemic meaning that the entire team who worked on this movie were remote from one another, which bumps the rating up a little in my opinion. Raya and the Last Dragon is certainly a glimmer of hope and turning point for a new golden age of Disney movies and I look forward to what will be produced in the future.",Raya and the Last Dragon

People need to lighten up 🤣 x As for one review about the dragons being tacky, I have to disagree! They have been created to be child friendly, colourful and happy! I wouldnt want to see a scary dragon in a family friendly movie, that would really scare children x The movie also taught a valuable lesson of being together to make a better world and forgiveness to eachothers wrong doings ❤ Whoever may be reading this, just go relax and watch this movie to see what you think x

1108,crisbolanosd,I'll give a star for the visuals,1,17 July 2021,"I am sick of people justifying how terrible this movie was by saying ""it's just a kid's movie"", I am beyond disappointed. I followed updates and news on it for weeks and was incredibly excited to see what appeared to be a beautifully animated movie with an interesting plot, rich culture and world-building, and great character design. While the visuals are stunning and the animation is generally smooth for something produced during a pandemic, it completely went to waste under the awful writing, all that work that went into scenes that were used as quick backdrops at best. All of the characters were so flat with absolutely no growth, Raya's whole personality is so repetitive and her character growth makes no sense. Most of the characters are just there to fill the quota for having one of each tribe and are otherwise completely useless, adding nothing to the movie. Their motivations are either incredibly weak or non-existent. The transitions are horrible and I'm pretty sure there's even a scene where the dialogue literally just cuts midway without so much as a fade. The plot is also incredibly repetitive and gets boring very quickly with no real consequences.I'm not even going to comment on the dragon, you already know.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1109,neverwithoutad,"Great visuals, ok story",7,22 July 2021,"I enjoyed Raya and the Last Dragon. I thought it leaned pretty heavily on the Avatar: The Last Airbender influences but not necessarily in a bad way. It's just that ATLA was a 3-season TV show and so presenting such a huge-feeling world in that context made sense. Raya's world feels a bit too big for its runtime which leaves it all feeling somewhat shallow, like a video game where you are rushing through all the levels, as another reviewer put it.I will say that I disagree with people who felt the story was totally unoriginal. I felt that the relationship between Raya and her rival was original and an interesting focus on the relationship between two young women. That was actually my favorite part of the film and I would love to see more films that do this.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1110,mrslewbo,Liked the movie!,7,9 August 2021,"The movie was good. It was pretty entertaining. At times, it was boring. Some scenes were predictable. It's a Disney movie that I can watch over and over again.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1111,tjmayes-23997,It was ok.,4,28 August 2021,The Dragons really through it off for me. Sisu looked like she was made to make merchandise. I also feel like it lacked depth within relationships across the board. What about the other dragons? They all come back and can't say anything after being gone for so long? Did we run out of money? This was definitely a movie to grab the attention of children and get them to ask for the toys and that's about it. Any film lover could see there are quite a few things that make this movie feel a bit off.,Raya and the Last Dragon
1112,christophercesarano-7,Didn't expect to be this enthralled in this story...,9,3 September 2021,"IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT HOW I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS FILM SKIP TO THE SECOND PARAGRAPHI remember seeing trailers for ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" in March, and I thought to myself: It just looks like a kids movie. There was a showing of this movie at a public park in my town. I watched about 20 mins but wasn't really that interested. A few days ago, I was on a transatlantic flight and this film was included on the video screen in the plane. So I figured I would just watch it, and I wasn't expecting much. However, maybe I should have.The first thing that impressed me with this film was the visuals. The five lands (Heart, Talon, Spine, Fang and Tail) each have their own ""glow"" that fits each land perfectly. The yellow glow on the streets of Talon. The winter chill in Spine. The vibrant colors in Heart. It is all perfectly executed, which makes it especially impressive considering this film was produced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the animators, voice actors and other crew members were forced to work at home.The voice cast could not have been better: Kelly Marie Tran was exceptional as Raya, and another cast member that I feel doesn't get enough attention was Gemma Chan as Namaari. She did an incredible job voicing the baddie, even though it turns out at the end of this film there was more to her than just being the antagonist. Izzac Wang as Boun, Benedict Wong as Tong and Daniel Dae Kim as the Chief are exceptional side characters.This leads me to my favorite part of the movie: Sisu. What an awesome character. I hadn't seen much of Awkwafina, but my respect for her skyrocketed after I watched this film. She wonderfully portrays Sisu as a fun-loving dragon with a comedic twist; however, there is a serious side to her. She is brave, compassionate and caring, and is also very wise. She also explains her feeling of inferiority as opposed to her siblings to Raya when they first meet with the line: ""Have you ever done a group project but there's like that one kid who didn't chip in as much, but still ended up with the same grade? Well, I wasn't the one who actually made the gem, I just turned it in."" This self deprecation adds even more unique elements to her character. I literally cannot imagine another other voice actor to voice Sisu other than Awkwafina, she brings that much charm to the character and I feel that Sisu would not have been the same if she hadn't been voiced by her. Also, Sisu's design is stunning. With a majestic blue mane, no wings and a long tail, she is beautiful to look at. She is without a doubt one of my favorite movie characters of all time.Also, I just love the differences between Raya and Sisu. On one hand, Raya is always looking over her shoulder, preparing for someone to betray her because she has been betrayed in the past. On the other hand, Sisu is outgoing, wants to trust everyone and wants to see the good in people. That's what makes their conversation on Boun's boat so effective, as Raya says she really wanted to believe Kumandra could be restored, but she doesn't think she can trust anyone after seeing how deceiving people can be to get what they want. But Sisu says that maybe the world is broken because people don't trust each other anymore. However, I don't think the message of this movie is to trust everyone no matter what they have done to you in the past. It is saying sometimes you are the one who has to take the first step, no matter what you have been through previously, as seen in the ending.The martial arts fight scenes are spot on, and are actually inspired by some SE Asian martial arts, which I think is awesome representation. Also, in general this movie is pretty good with the SE Asian representation, and we got our first SE Asian Disney princess, which I think is pretty awesome.My favorite sequence/scene of the film is Sisu's death and the whole Druun takeover on Fang. Namaari pulls a crossbow on the gang after receiving the Sisu necklace from Raya. She has a choice; do what's right for Fang or the world. She is torn by which side she should choose. Raya puts her hand on her sword, but Sisu says ""I got this"" and talks to Namaari. She actually starts to get through to her, when Raya prematurely throws her sword at Namaari, causing her to fire. The bolt strikes Sisu. This scene was so effective for two reasons. The first is that both Namaari and Raya are responsible for Sisu's death. Sure, Namaari had the crossbow, but Raya is the one who threw her sword at Namaari, triggering the natural reaction. If Raya had only trusted Sisu when said ""I got this,"" then Sisu would still be alive. The second reason is just the pure shock value of it. I was not expecting that at ALL, and the horror on everyone's faces as Sisu falls off the cliff was heartbreaking to watch. What follows next was even more impressive to watch. As the Druun take over Fang, Raya is consumed by rage, and wants to finish Namaari off for good. And I know that this is not a good thing and that Raya takes a dark path here, but GODDAMNIT, Raya is so badass! The last fight scene between Raya and Namaari was exceptionally well done, and when Raya gains the upper hand, Namaari reminds her that Raya is just as much to blame for Sisu's death as she is. This was just incredible.The flashback with Sisu's siblings (Pengu, Amba, Pranee and Jagan) was extremely well done. All of them are beautifully designed just like Sisu, and the power of Sisu's siblings trusting her to save the world had tremendous contribution to the message.Also, James Newton Howard's musical score for this film was incredible. It conveyed so much beauty with so many different styles. From the majestic music as Sisu runs across the sky to the choppy, intense music when Raya is fighting Namaari in Fang. It is all perfect.And then there's the ending. This one punched me in the feels, as the Druun are defeated and everything that turned to stone is revived. All of the dragons are revived and resurrect Sisu with their magic, and her reunion with Raya almost made me tear up. Namaari also is overcome with emotion after Sisu's resurrection. The way Sisu looks at her as if to say ""I forgive you"" was so effective, and Namaari's ruthless and confident persona is contrasted with the awkward shyness she feels when she is pulled into the group hug. The visuals in this scene are amazing, with the dragons running on the raindrops and Sisu finally being reunited with her family. Seeing all of the main characters reunited with their families, most notably: Raya and her dad. The look on Benja's face as he sees his daughter for the first time in six years and still recognizes her immediately could not have been executed better, and Raya has good news for her father too. Kumandra has been restored. There are very few movies that actually get me a little emotional, but this was one of them.There is one main flaw with ""Raya and the Last Dragon."" The writers tried to mix modern day slang and vocabulary with the setting of an ancient, fantastical world. And it doesn't really work for me and it ends up being a little cringe. Do you think a 500 year old water dragon is gonna know what a group project is? Or a dance battle? I know it's meant to appeal to audiences in 2021 and use vocabulary that people are familiar with today, but I feel like it disrupts the magic and fantasy of Kumandra. That could just be me, but I feel like the humor could have been executed a little better, although the movie still made me laugh in some spots. There are two minor things that I feel like people talk negatively about, but I can still defend. First off, I know the plot is very similar to the plots of other Disney movies. However, I think it certainly works. Would an original plot have been nice? Sure, but I don't think the movie would have been the same with it. With the classic Disney/Pixar formula, the film works, and that's all that matters to me. Also, brief hot take on Noi. Look, I know that a two year old con artist is ridiculous and the scenes with Noi did make me cringe a little. But it is no more ridiculous than Jack Jack from the Incredibles. Everyone loves him, too. So I don't really get it. Yes it's ridiculous and unrealisitc. But is this movie meant to be realistic? Absolutely not.There is so much more I can say about this movie, but I need to wrap up this very long review. I thought ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" was an exceptional film, and instantly became one of my favorite films to date. It is not without its flaws, however the positives outweigh the negatives by a ton. I honestly can't believe all the negative reviews I saw for this film. Did those people watch the same film I did? Or better yet, watch the film at all? Watch this movie, I think you'll enjoy it.",Raya and the Last Dragon

1117,katlin-19458,Okay but Lacking,6,7 November 2021,"There is no doubt that Raya and the Last Dragon was an ABSOLUTELY magical film that INSTANTLY ignited the inner child in me. The animation was exquisite! So much detail was put into the background and the characters' appearance. The fur and hair looked as if I could reach up to the television and touch it. As a child, I loved the animated adventure movies that emanated the heart and soul of the characters, such as Mulan, Frozen, and even Onward. However, I felt that this movie lacked the character development that creates this heart-feeling. The characters felt empty, at times. The first twenty minutes of the movie seemed to stem around the main character's development, which is understandable, but it was too slow. It was difficult for me to conceptualize where Raya, the main character, was coming from for most of the movie because she felt very disconnected. In addition, the most crucial parts of the movie seemed to be skimmed over, while the rest was heavily dragged out. The most climactic fight scenes seemed to be briefly touched on, while the calm scenes seemed to be too lengthy. In addition, the other main antagonist seemed to be flat, since she was missing character details that would make the audience both dislike and empathize with her. I felt that there was a lack of depth in the characters. The characters' intentions often confused me, as their decisions seemed to be a bit scattered. While I enjoyed this movie, it is lacking in essential character details and plot development. It is not something that I would actively seek out.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The story moves at a pace that never really allows you to attach emotionally to any of the characters. Sisu isnt funny, and neither is Boun; just random and over acted. Poor writing, rushed, no ""disney"" magic. Songs in Disney movies usually allow to audience to connect emotionally, maybe thats why the story telling never felt very deep.

Even though it is not based on a real story like Mulan, it brings the unique environments of the multiple nations. Is the movie for everyone, no it is not; but my daughter enjoyed many parts. The villain is probably the most scariest one she's ever seen, I have to fast for those parts. Well done Disney, look forward to more.

I spend a lot of time near water and often think about how it connects people beyond our own imaginations. Raya and the Last Dragon is all about building trust to save everyone-with water being the greatest protector and the element that connects them all. Just like a river (and love), it's powerful and rushing and appears almost too fast (maybe scary), but then just around the bend, it's calming and sentimental.The story is soo needed during these uncertain times, the voice actresses/actors are brilliant, the animation is beautiful, the pace and editing is just like WATER, and I LOVED every moment.

We both thoroughly enjoyed it and she was extremely glued to the screen throughout, even ignoring her popcorn at points.It's female centered for the girls, but there's plenty of fighting and action for the boys. There's a lot of great action and the movie never really has any slow parts.It's really difficult to know what to say about the story because there's a lot of surprises and I could easily say too much.

When I found out about this film a year ago that it was going to be based in Asian culture...I couldn't be more excited.But...what? I could t have been more unimpressed by a movie. This might be my least favorite animated film of this new post-2010 era.The movie and story are EXTREMELY lacking, compared to past Disney stories. Everything was lackluster and I feel like the creators became lazy throughout on effort/editing/budget/time/effort.So many scenes were rushed and underdeveloped. It's like they skipped so much buildup.Examples:The players reach a new town. Wow! Looks beautiful and cool! Oh...after fifteen minutes and not much climax we're already leaving? Uh...okay....A character perishes or dies. Oh no! This is awful!!! ....wait...the other characters are barely reacting? Oh...okay...And the plot and character actions were confusing and didn't make sense. Why did that dragon do this? Why did that villain do that? I preferred other Disney movies prior to this.And the themes. The themes were stated many times. But just not portrayed...successfully or convincingly. I didn't really come out that affected. A little bit, but I could have been more.I wish they actually made our film on Asian representation good, but instead, we got a pretty half-efforted film that makes Cars 2 and Frozen look like masterpieces....okay, maybe not Cars 2. That's an exaggeration.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1163,AntzAntz,Decent movie for kids (and ignore those really bad reviews),7,13 March 2021,"Some of the reviewers here are just insane. This is a Disney animation. This is made to target YOUR KIDS. NOT YOU. Some animation movies far exceeds their expectations. Great! This one does not. But it is still a reasonably good animation movie for kids. You want heart-grabbing plot, you want Oscar-Winner-Type acting, go watch Nomadland. I took my 10 year old to the movie, and she laughed and cried, and she loved the movie. You ask me, that's goal achieved.Yes the plot is very predictable. I knew what's gonna happen at the end. And I could predict what happens almost step by step. But the storytelling was fine. There are things that an adult may feel cliche. But please ask your kids before you jump up and down and smash this into oblivion because it is so ""childish"". And by the way, the images are really well made and really beautiful.It's a decent movie. Worth the money.",Raya and the Last Dragon

1165,abou_jjouj,Worst Disney movie,1,17 March 2021,"Nothing is really good about this movie; some may like the animation but I'm not a big fan, I think it's too barbie like. No real story behind it except that you can trust everyone, even strangers. No real villain, no real backstory or personal risks and change. It's a simple straightforward movie made for 5 year olds that can't even ask a question, kids that will only be amazed by the colors and the useless dancing dragons, kids that don't expect any real outcome out of the movie. After decades of real storytelling and advancements in movie making and story, we find Disney, the all knowing, making the same mistakes that would destroy any small time company; we are presented with a story that has no natural flow, where the characters seem forced and has no room to really grow. As a fan of Moana, and someone who was really excited for Raya, I just found myself utterly disappointed and looking for somebody that can get me back those 2 hours of my miserable life.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1166,master_losser,One of the better disney movies in a while,9,7 March 2021,"The animations were sometimes near-photorealistic, the world was rich with lore and culture, the humor landed most of the time, and the characters were memorable.
Don't understand why it's getting so much flak in the reviews. This movie is trying to take things deeper and not make a clear villain, which I absolutely love.
Yes, the message was a little on the nose, but anyone with more than five minutes of real-life experience knows that this is how the real world works too. We don't have a tangible, objective evil, which is why the movie's plot works.
The designs were top-notch, very little to improve there. Especially loved Sisu's androgyn form, but that's my biased opinion.
The only thing REALLY holding this movie back is the ending. It has the standard disney ""everything is solved in a matter of seconds"" stamp all over it. I hope we get to see more from this universe.",Raya and the Last Dragon

The characters were underdeveloped though. I get I was a kids movie but, I've seen Disney do a better job with characters than this. It was such a fast paced movie I think maybe they just tried to fit this whole magical world, a whole storyline and a big cast of characters in such a small amount of time. So, it left little room to build on the characters. I did however love the dragons, the animation style, the fight scenes were really good. I had a lot of fun watching this.

The South East Asian mythology and themes drawing on the background of the region were beautifully done, although potentially this was too foreign for some audiences to understand. Personally, I think Disney should be applauded for giving representation to different cultures and heritage. I'm sure not many understand the history of the area.The protagonist in particular is a flawed heroine who I really identified with, and she will is now one of my favourite Disney characters. While I think there were bits and pieces that could have been improved, such as the pacing and fleshing out some of the minor character story arcs, it was an original story. I wasn't sure at the beginning where it was going, but the moral and ending was sweet.For kids and young at heart there was plenty to love.

There are 2 strong female character leads and they're not victims. Best of all, they aren't chasing some fictitious Prince Charming that frankly doesn't exist in real life and in my opinion should not be taught to young children.Teaching children that working together in spite of our differences (both physical and philosophical) is a powerful message which frankly needs to be told in today's divisive climate. Adults could learn something from this feature.Best of all, this film is entertaining, beautifully shot and has a strong emotional element that brings this message of inclusiveness to life.",Raya and the Last Dragon

1184,cjwsmarty,My honest opinion on this film,6,13 October 2021,"I watched this film for free when it was made available on Disney+. To put it simply, this was... mediocre. The best way for me to describe it is if you took Avengers: Infinity War, broke it down into a plot checklist, then made your characters go from point a to point b on said list with very little organic movement between said points.To be more specific, this film follows a somewhat standard Disney Animated Film Formula. Dead Parents? Check. Princess with Animal Sidekick? Check. Villain that gets redeemed at the end? Sort-of.Not exactly my cup of tea, however if you enjoyed it, then good on you! Its just my silly personal opinion that you have every right to agree/disagree with.If you want something with more thought and effort put into it, go watch Soul. That was always free and i would have gladly paid $30 to watch that film.",Raya and the Last Dragon

1189,weasleygirls,A feel-good movie that deserves better,9,20 March 2021,I've never written a review before but there were so many bad ones that I felt I had too. This was a great movie. It is aimed at children so it is simple but that's okay! I found it to be enjoyable and even thought-provoking! Many people have said that it lacks originality and that is the case but that's been the case for most Disney movies from the past fifty years. I don't understand why many people are only complaining about it for Raya and the Last Dragon as if it is something new. It's like saying why do people keep using the hero's journey. Because it works! Raya and the Last Dragon ended and made me feel good and hopeful as well as examine some of my own thoughts on things like trust and I'm not even a child.

The animation is the best there has ever been. It is mesmerizing. The storyline is typical for a kids movie from Disney and if you expect a Sorkin level screenplay you have come to the wrong place. I watched it with my 3 nieces 12, 7 and 5 and they laughed and were very into it and off their phones. It's a fun movie and the voice acting is on point.

I would have given the movie 10 stars, but i thought the child and the monkeys were a little bit too much. But then again it is a disney movie and it was a little bit funny.
It was an amazing and an emotional adventure.
The characters always made me smile, the landscape was great and it was beautifully animated.
What i did not expect is that the dragon got shot, witch made the movie a little darker for a disney movie for a short while.
I felt rayas anger towards namaari in the end, but the best part was when she finally gave her, her trust.Please don't compare this movie with other disney movies.
Yes the movie could have done more, but so can alot of other great movies. I think it was fantastic as it is.Ps. For those of you who thought it was ""childish"" its from disney... thats kind of what they do.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1193,greeviangirl,"A solid and absolutely beautiful film, but tropey",7,16 April 2021,"Raya and the Last Dragon shows off with stunning animation and world design, along with a refreshing frontline of well written female rivals. Seeing badass women on screen being strong fighters and expressing anger, pain, rage, and vulnerability is something we don't highlight enough, and it is the brightest aspect of the film. The weak points of the movie are common across almost every Disney release in recent years: predictable story beats, overly saccharine sidekicks whose jokes sometimes fall flat, and lack of any real stakes or tragedy because they can't risk scaring the kids. But this movie does more than enough to make up for it with a pervading sense of that Disney wonder and, ironically, sincerity. Some of the scenes literally took my breath away, from the visual design to the emotion expressed behind it. The score is also expertly done and memorable after the credits roll. Though it may make your eyes roll at times when it falls into Disney predictability or a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic style morality tale, this film is a worthwhile watch.",Raya and the Last Dragon

However, I feel the movie was way too rushed and lacked in character development... A lot of modern movies would benefit from slowing down the plot and dwelling on important character moments. I know that not every Disney movie needs to be a musical, but maybe Raya and the last dragon could have had a few songs where the audience could connect with the characters.
I find that the humour was quite forced, and at least a few of the sidekick characters were unnecessary.
But, it still was a good movie and I would definitely recommend giving it a chance.",Raya and the Last Dragon

1207,betnayo,Most annoying dragon ever,3,13 March 2021,Feel asleep after 30 minutes. The dragon was the most annoying character. Couldn't watch it.,Raya and the Last Dragon
1208,julia_de_bruijn,Beautiful art but bad plot,5,5 March 2021,"Honestly I really wanna say I liked the movie, cause I love dragons and Raya is a badass, but it was just okay.The movie definitely had some nice elements. The art was beautiful and there were some funny characters that felt like they could have had real potential (and as stated above, Raya was a badass). But the plot just felt kinda.. subpar?? Sometimes things that happened didn't really make sense.I couldn't get into the movie, but it was still an enjoyable watch.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1209,bartvdlaan-45176,Pleasurable but not that original,7,13 May 2021,The film involves the classical hero's journey and had some enjoyable elements. However there were a lot of similarities with other animations in terms of the characters. Was hoping for something original.,Raya and the Last Dragon
1210,AfroRus,Cats have no souls?,7,15 May 2021,"Disney has no soul.Otherwise, well done and a message well received, except for being a little too overly cute and sentimental in parts. Pixar manages to get more of an impact without the exaggeration.I'd love to see it in 3D.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1211,aalexander-52331,Excellent story ! Job well done writers & Disney,9,25 April 2021,"Hey guys, this was terrific. The story was truly wonderful.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1212,mushfaqalam,Great animation but bs story,5,18 March 2021,"The animation of the movie was awesome. One of the best animation of any animated movies. But the story was very boring. Felt sleepy while watching it. You could guess what is going to happen after the 1st 15 minutes. Its more of a kids movie. Honestly, i am rating this a 5 just for its animation orelse it would have been a 4. A bit of a waste of time in my opinion.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1213,patelhardikdrk,Ending Blows,4,9 March 2021,I know it's disney but the ending was trash. I would watch Cats instead of this.,Raya and the Last Dragon
1214,dianasamman,It's pretty good,7,6 May 2021,"I've been reading through comments and I don't know why people are being very harsh with reviews, it was a great movie, fun to watch and great visuals, give it some credit for the stunning animation, you don't have to criticize everything!",Raya and the Last Dragon
1215,thiagomorura,Amazing,10,6 March 2021,The best Disney Animation so far! Everyone should watch It!,Raya and the Last Dragon
1216,jp_episcopata,It doesn't even look like a Disney movie,6,13 March 2021,"It's a good children movie. But the plot, the animation, the music and the executing are far from the expected for a Disney movie.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1217,alananugent,"Here for the queer femme nuances, stayed for the dragons.",10,7 March 2021,"This movie exceeded my family's expectations. Sure it follows a Disney ""template"" and as my wife pointed out, it's Disney and let's accept we're dealing with an HEA. The magic was in the exquisite art and casting and talented crew. Our queer family was hoping for a romantic love connection between Raya & Namaari.... ""what's drippin'?"" ;-)This movie was spectacular.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1218,shanebuchanan,Would be a lot higher but....,3,7 March 2021,Who thought it was a good idea to make the voice of the dragon Awkwafina? Her voice is the most annoying in show biz,Raya and the Last Dragon
1219,elisheridan,Boring generic characters with no chemistry,1,4 June 2021,No clever humor or dialogue. Plot was boring and unoriginal. Thought the dragon had a cool design but then it talked. Yikes.,Raya and the Last Dragon
1220,mennovandenoever-52740,Loved it!,10,12 March 2021,"What a beautiful disney movie! The story, animation, the colors. Everything!",Raya and the Last Dragon
1221,paul-teyssier_imdb,"Manichean, simplistic, no songs",5,11 April 2021,"The PC police clearly wrote the script. Characters are beyond shallow. No male characters to speak of. Photo is beautiful, but this is the only saving grace.You should re-watch frozen instead.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1222,drbohlooli,Best Animation ever,10,10 June 2021,This is the best animation I've ever watch. I was totally impressed when I found out this was a work from home project. Good job Disney 👏,Raya and the Last Dragon
1223,usamaumer-83964,Exceptionally good,10,9 May 2021,"One of the best animated work i have ever seen, after a long time i have seen such sophisticated and comprehensive work on a film. I wonder this must get a sequel as well.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1224,itzivelasco,Very weak movie,4,8 March 2021,"Poor storytelling, poor character design... and I'd even say poor animation! I mean, I'm not an expert in animation, but the moves of the characters in many shots don't look like Disney quality.Anyway, I wouldn't even have paid attention to those details if the movie wasn't so boring. It has a terrybly long opening filled with dialogs about things that aren't stablished visually that you don't even care what they're talking about. It takes forever for the movie to take off.When you get to the end of the movie you understand what they were trying to build, but it's so missleading so many times that you end up losing your attention. It's a pity, because you can feel the hard work behind.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1225,theoctopusofmoralinjustice,A beautiful and engaging spectacle,9,23 May 2021,"I've seen a lot of Disney films in my day, but no reviews have shocked me more than the reviews for this particular film. Fans and critiques call it predictable, as if that isn't the foundation for most of Disney's films- they are for children after all. Others claim that it isn't funny enough, as though a Disney film must be funny to be consumable. Still yet, some say the characters are too numerous and poorly developed. Personally, I couldn't disagree more. The relationship between Raya and her father was meaningful from the beginning. Their relationship drives the film forward as she fights to get back what has been lost. The sequence in which Sisu explains how she came to be the savior of the world due to her family's trust was a poignant and special scene, maybe even more so because of how ill received Sisu was by the audience. What the audience saw as annoying and immature, was enough for her family. Namaari is a convincing portrayal of the battle between loyalty to those close to you, and the betterment of the world at large. Please do not let the poor reviews deter you from watching this. I think perhaps too many adults have begun to see Disney as a film industry that should cater to them, rather than to their original (and intended) audience of children. Raya is a realistically flawed, but strong character that I would be proud to show any child. I thought this film was one characterized by wonder, trust, and strength.",Raya and the Last Dragon
1226,anderachristensen,Pretty but weak,1,7 March 2021,"The movie was poorly paced and unoriginal. Without spoiling, one of the characters commits a very terrible act against another character and then tries to spread the blame and never accepts fault for their actions. It made me so mad I wrote this review.",Raya and the Last Dragon
