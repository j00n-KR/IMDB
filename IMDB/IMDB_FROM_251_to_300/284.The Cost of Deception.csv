0,ohhnonono,This movie is great and the huge number of poor reviews are the proof,10,28 October 2021,"Great picture, great action on a sensitive political topic, since movie appeared a few months before elections and the real life correspondents of the politicians from the movie are leading one of the major parties in Hungary.Events from the movie are matching the real events, real politicians and their real actions, however the story line is fictional.The movie received above 20.000 rating votes on the first day of screening, most of them were the lowest possible - the reason is that the affected politicians organized a rating war to try to discredit the movie, current rating (1.4) is not reflecting the real value of the movie.",The Cost of Deception
1,leifugynokseg,Hungarian House of Cards - a word class thriller,10,22 October 2021,"A Hungarian crime story that can be projected anywhere in the world.Fictional feature film with interesting twists.It's a work with very serious quality, with skillful, authentic actors and beautiful images.It takes place in beautiful Budapest and there are exciting action scenes in it. Political topic, but not propaganda.A real world class thriller.",The Cost of Deception
2,barokkkisvaros,"I was expecting something worse, but this is still really bad",3,31 October 2021,"I was really excited about this movie since the announcment, because the time and the events it presents are a really memorable part of my childhood. Honestly, I was expecting something worse, but this is still a boring, dumb, amateur and often illogical movie. The cinematography is weird, at the beginning it looks cool but slowly it become something really strange. The editing is also really lame, stuff just happen. There is part in the middle of movie where I thought that it will end, my friends had the same feeling aaand nope. When it actually ends it doesnt feel right, the story could go further but its suddenly over. The acting is weird too, it feels like they not even want to do this. This movie has the worst rain vfx ever. The whole thing is feel like watching a 2 hours long mix of csi miami, komissar rex and a b category american action movie from the 2000's.There was a few good moments i enjoyed, Zsolt Zayzon is a great actor but they just can't save this film.",The Cost of Deception
3,csabaz-34822,"Interesting, good film-making. Surprisingly authentic.",10,22 October 2021,"Interesting, good film-making. Surprisingly authentic.I never seen like this amazing film, since BEN-HUR!Everyone must see!Thank you guys just keep going!!",The Cost of Deception
4,hxfhcz,Joke,1,21 October 2021,"Unclassifiable...too bad. Actors are unratable, plot is a shame. Hopefully no more state money will be spent on movies like this in Hungary. I mean, there should be a standard of quality in the Hungarian film industry.This movie is not belowe average but in the minus section.",The Cost of Deception
5,durmol,Great artists - true content,10,22 October 2021,As a witness of the events in October 2006 I enjoyed this artistic version very much. But besides the artistic values it provides important details of historical facts as well. Highly recommended.,The Cost of Deception
6,dekorex-22694,not recomend,1,23 October 2021,"Spending so much money on such a bad movie is a shame. Utterly boring, horrible acting and a very chaotic and unrealistic script makes this movie a waste of time.",The Cost of Deception
7,hunpusi,An objective review/critic about the movie,7,25 October 2021,"I wanted to write a review about this movie, because there are a lot of misinformation, fake critics, fake promotions. I just watched it. I am: pretty well informed about the world politics, world economy, history, constantly watching economy stuffs on YouTube, statistics, thinking about internal and external politics/economy, certified iq 139, trying to be as objective as possible with references. I write this for you to understand, who write this review. The movie: Is it bad? Definitely no! Is it good? Hey, I saw worse movies in this week. Is it propaganda movie? Well if House of cards and other Hollywood political drama movies are, then yes. But I don't think so. Is it documentary? It based on true events, but this is a crime-drama, not documentary. Things happened, but this is still a movie. Is two hours are long? For me, it wasn't. There are new things, twists constantly. It can build the empathy, and you get excited about the characters. -What I liked in this film? The actress is beautiful, acting is upper mediocre, the screen is good, I liked the music, Budapest is beautiful, character development is great. Who would I recommend: If you want to watch a movie about a riot, with some crime detective story, with some political tricks, if you liked House of Cards, if you can watch a movie as a movie, without hateful to the government or the opposite (so you can watch a movie as an adult or you are foreigner) I definitely recommend. My rate is 6.5 because I enjoyed it as a movie, I have attachment to Budapest, the actress is beautiful, the display is good(and you know what an imdb 6.5 movie is). I will watch it again, because there are a lot of details what I couldn't focus, probably.P. S.: Please rate the movie itself after you watched it. Please ignore the whole Hungarian media about it. This is a good movie in Hungarian level, and it makes me sad, that critics make reviews based on the actual political fighting and not about the movie. This is worth to watch.",The Cost of Deception
8,racztamas-30622,An objectively bad movie - but there's more!,1,23 October 2021,"A movie can be carried by three things: a good plot, amazing visuals or interesting characters. This one had none of it, except for historically mostly accurate sets, which really stood out in this absolute waste of data.The plot itself is mostly based on a conspiracy theory, and the characters are either the most goody-two shoes boyscout characters, while the antagonists are only fueled by the power of pure evil. I'm not even kidding, Voldemort and the Emperor aren't even close. And what for? Well, prepare to die with that question, because even Darren Cross in Ant-Man seems to have fairly valid motivations in comparison.The cinematography is just... meh? It's got no personality whatsoever, and it just feels like it's shot with a generic template for an action movie (which is really dumb, because this is the most boring pile of crap I've ever seen).The pacing is also so off... Even living through the whole thing in real time seemed to have better flow than sitting through this movie.All in all, this kind of good vs. Evil story wouldn't hold up in 2021 even if the villains had reasonable motivations, because there are zero shades thrown around, it's pure black and white. Any spoiler warning is completely useless, because there is literally nothing to spoil in this plot.And don't get me started on the ""marketing"" of this movie.0/10, worse than Daredevil 2004, but at least that was sometimes funny.",The Cost of Deception
