0,Leofwine_draca,Instantly forgettable,5,30 October 2018,"GOOSEBUMPS is a very modern-feeling adaptation of the work of R.L. Stine, the author who had a big hit with his GOOSEBUMPS series of young adult horror novels in the 1990s. I never encountered them - I was too old at the time and went straight for Stephen King instead - but I was willing to give this one a go despite not liking Jack Black as an actor. It turns out to be a play-it-safe production, definitely aimed at young viewers, and one which frequently turns into a sprawling CGI adventure as do so many Hollywood flicks these days. Black plays Stine himself, whose fictional creations come to life and terrorise a small town. The teenage cast members then spend the running time escaping from various monsters. The CGI creations are quite typical of their type; hardly realistic, but some creativity has gone into their look. The film itself is instantly forgettable.",Goosebumps
1,SnoopyStyle,fine,6,27 June 2016,"Gale Cooper (Amy Ryan) is the new high school vice principal and moves her son Zach (Dylan Minnette) from New York to Madison, Delaware where her sister Lorraine (Jillian Bell) lives. Zach meets the girl next door Hannah (Odeya Rush) and her angry dad who turns out to be R. L. Stine (Jack Black), bestselling Goosebumps author. At school, he's befriended by bumbling loser Champ (Ryan Lee).The kids are fine. Ryan Lee is the comedic fool. Jack Black may not fit this role that well. It's a lot of stuff being stuffed into this. It's a little over-stuffed. It's a lot of monsters. It's also not the most compelling. There is lots of action but the intensity is relatively low. It tries to be comedic and it does have a certain amount of fun. It's a fine young-adult action comedy but not anything exceptional.",Goosebumps
2,Prismark10,By the book,6,16 May 2016,"Jack Black plays a fictionalised version of real life author R L Stine and dials it down a bit as a moody, sullen author who wants to keep himself to himself but when a new teenager, Zach Cooper moves next door and is attracted to Stine's daughter Hannah. However Zach is uneasy about his father and he does not know who he really is.When Zach and his new school friend stumbles upon Stine's book collection they unlock the monsters inside the books who unleash themselves into the open world led by the dummy Slappy.They need to escape the monsters but more importantly Stine needs to somehow put them back into a book by writing a new chapter.The film is similar in many ways to Jumanji and at times just as hectic. Maybe it has too many monsters on the loose although Slappy the ventriloquist dummy makes a good and sinister impression.An enjoyable family film with cheesy laughs and scares, teenagers would like it and moves along at a good pace.",Goosebumps
3,claudio_carvalho,"Silly, but Entertains",6,6 March 2016,"The teenager Zach (Dylan Minnette) moves from New York with his widow mother Gale (Amy Ryan) to Madison, Delaware, where she will be the vice- principal of the local high-school. Zach is bored and upset and while bringing his cardboard boxes with his belongings home, he meets his gorgeous next-door neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush) that welcomes him. But soon her creepy father R.L. Stine (Jack Black) threatens him if he gets close to his daughter again. Zach befriends the clumsy Champ (Ryan Lee) at school and they schedule to go to a party together on Friday. However, Zach meets Hannah again but they are caught by Stine. Zach believes that Stine is an abusive father and he breaks in his house with Champ to seek out Hannah. When Zach opens a book in Stine's library, he accidentally unleashes a monster from the book. Soon he learns that the weird Stine is a famous writer of horror stories that keeps his imaginary friends that are monsters locked up in each book. But Zach released the evil Slappy that promises to bring havoc to Madison opening all the books on the same time.""Goosebumps"" is a silly film that entertains. The plot has funny moments but Champ is an unbearable character and Ryan Lee does not help with his face. ""Aunt"" Lorraine is also annoying, but Amy Ryan performs a nice character. The chemistry between Dylan Minnette and the lovely Odeya Rush, who seems to be a sister of Mila Kunis, are worthwhile watching. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Goosebumps: Monstros e Arrepios"" (""Goosebumps: Monsters and Chills"")",Goosebumps
4,nogodnomasters,A HORSE CAN'T DISAPPEAR,8,21 April 2018,"Zach (Dylan Minnette) and his Vice Principle mom Gale (Amy Ryan) move to Madison, Delaware next to the home of R.L. Stine (Jack Black). Through a series of mishaps, Stine's magical books are opened releasing all the monsters from his stories. Stine has a daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush) as our two teens are crushing on each other.Delightful film for the kids. You don't have to be familiar with the works of Stine to appreciate the film filled with puns and corny lines. The Elfman soundtrack incorporates riffs from the Harry Potter theme, but doesn't let them play too long.Rated PG, there is some monster intensity",Goosebumps
5,kosmasp,By the numbers,6,17 September 2016,"It's still pretty funny and you can be entertained by it, but just don't expect this to blow your mind. Maybe the 3D effects will, though I cannot judge them since I only saw the 2D version (though I don't felt it was necessary to see this in 3D). The special effects are OK, but since this tanked at the box office, you probably haven't seen it on the big screen either. The story wouldn't warrant that anyway, but it may have a bigger effect on viewers (especially young ones).So if you can get into the mindset or are actually young, than you will have a good time. If you're watching it with a kid, you also will have a good time. You won't have time to think about all the things that don't make any sense. And Jack Black is likable enough, not to mention the ""witty"" dialog all along",Goosebumps
6,classicsoncall,"""I was born with the gift of fear"".",7,9 May 2016,"The first surprise for this viewer (after the fact, that is), was that this movie was a theatrical release. I never saw it show up at one of my local theaters, but then again, I'm not into this kind of stuff as it seems more appropriate for a teen audience. What drew me to the picture was my daughter loaning it out from the local library and inviting me over to watch it along with my granddaughter. The other drawing card was Jack Black, he can be entertaining in the right vehicle.I thought the picture was cleverly done for the most part, even if it borrowed ideas from other movies and books appealing to a teenage clientele. The character I got the biggest kick out of was Champ/Chump, humorously portrayed by Ryan Lee. He had the best and funniest lines and delivered them with ease, perfectly suited to his nerdy character. The one idea I should have seen coming was that of Hannah (Odeya Rush) being one of Stine's (Black) fictional characters come to life. But having done that it was an easy segue to realize she would have been real by the time the movie ended.The story's Slappy character reminded me of one of those old time 'Twilight Zone' episodes in which a ventriloquist dummy takes over it's owner's personality and comes to life in the episode's twist ending. It was actually called 'The Dummy' and appeared during the show's third season. Young viewers of this film might not notice Slappy's resemblance to Jack Black just like I missed it when I was a kid watching The Twilight Zone. But one can be forgiven with all the other distractions going on, like the Abominable Snowman of Pasadena and the Werewolf of Fever Swamp. If you don't see your favorite R.L. Stine monster in the story right away, you just might need to wait a minute.",Goosebumps
7,gavin6942,Great Love Letter to R. L. Stine,7,24 October 2016,"A teenager teams up with the daughter of young adult horror author R. L. Stine (Jack Black) after the writer's imaginary demons are set free on the town of Madison, Delaware.Let us be perfectly frank about this film, and the fact it is not quite a perfect movie. The biggest problem, by far, is the use of CGI. The Abominable Snowman is a bit rough, and the Werewolf is absolutely horrible. Why they chose to draw a werewolf rather than put a guy in a suit is beyond me, but it is the biggest mistake.That being said, the film is an excellent love letter to R. L. Stine. He was never my favorite, but I did read a couple of his books, and I am sure many of my generation read quite a few. Somebody bought those 400 million copies... although geared towards teenagers or young adults, I almost feel like people aged 30-35 might appreciate the movie more, or at least in a different way.",Goosebumps
8,BA_Harrison,Everything from Aliens to Zombies.,6,23 January 2018,"The small town of Madison, Delaware is over-run by monsters that escape from the manuscripts of children's horror author R.L. Stine (Jack Black), and it is up to teenagers Zach (Dylan Minnette), Champ (Ryan Lee) and Hannah (Odeya Rush) to try and save the day.Whilst nothing spectacular or original in terms of story (see Jumanji and The Twilight Zone episode 'A World of His Own' for similar ideas done decades earlier), Goosebumps will no doubt please its intended audience - youngsters - and may very well appeal to older viewers who, like me, still embrace their inner child (I was born about twenty years too soon to enjoy Goosebumps for nostalgic reasons, but as old as I am now, I've never grown out of my love for movie monsters).With diminutive animated garden gnomes and a colossal preying mantis, and everything in between, there's more than enough creepy creature fun in this fantasy adventure to keep one entertained for the duration. Some of the CGI special effects are far from perfect (the Abominable Snowman and the wolfman are pretty ropey) and Jack Black teeters on annoying (nothing new there), but the fast pace and likeable teenage characters ensure that boredom never sets in.",Goosebumps
9,paul_haakonsen,It's Slappy's revenge...,6,15 June 2017,"Initially I was a little bit concerned about watching ""Goosebumps"" given the fact that it had Jack Black in one of the bigger roles. I am not really much of a fan of his, but I will say that he was actually good in this movie, and it was nice to see him out of the usual comedy genre that he performs in.Granted that this is a movie aimed at a family and young viewer audience, so you have a cast ensemble of relatively young acting performers. It should be said that they had cast the talents quite well, because the actors and actresses were doing good jobs with their given roles and characters.The storyline in ""Goosebumps"" was good and fun. I found it to be an interesting plot to have an authors creations from his books come to life when the books are opened. However, to have the author based on the actual author of the Goosebumps series was just a bit too silly. An homage to the iconic writer perhaps? I would hope so. But still a bit too out there.The CGI special effects and creature designs were just spectacular. It was such an amazing sight to witness this kind of spectacular visuals on the screen. There were so many wonderful details to each of the creature. The special effects alone more than make it well worth to watch the 2015 ""Goosebumps"" movie.The music score found in ""Goosebumps"" was also quite good, and very fitting to the movie. The music was very atmospheric and supplemented the various scenes and events that took place on the screen. But of course, with Danny Elfman composing the music, what else could be expected?""Goosebumps"" is a fun and wholesome movie for the entire family, and it is especially fun if you have read any of the Goosebump books, or at least is familiar with the books. It appeals to young and adult viewers alike, so that was a great accomplishment for director Rob Letterman.The movie is fast paced and never really paces down to a dull pace. So expect a fast thrill ride with lots of up and downs as the various creatures spring from the pages of the books.",Goosebumps
10,Coventry,Guaranteed Halloween-fun with the kids,7,31 October 2021,"I'm actually rather fond of how Jack Black's career evolved during the past ten years. I like seeing him in fantasy-flicks with a dark edge and child-friendly horror stories, like ""Jumanji"", ""The House with a Clock in its Walls"", or this ""Goosebumps"". As a life-long horror fanatic, I'm also always on the lookout for films I can watch together with my two children. Films that gently introduce them in the world of monsters, mayhem, and madness. ""Goosebumps"" lends itself perfectly for this purpose!Can't say I'm too familiar with the books and fantasy-universe of author R. L. Stine, but I really like how his persona is processed into the story. Jack Black depicts the slightly eccentric Stine, who lives with in Delaware and desperately tries to remain under the radar. The new neighbor boy, together with a friend and Stine's own daughter Hannah, accidentally unleased all Stine's monstrous creations from their book-cages, and they promptly turn the little town of Madison upside down.In terms of atmosphere, and balance between playfulness and thrills, ""Goosebumps"" reminded me of the phantasy/horror movies of my own childhood 30 years ago, like ""The Watcher in the Woods"", ""Dark Crystal"" or ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"". The settings are exquisite, with even a completely abandoned carnival in the middle of a forest, and a magnificent variety of scary monsters. There's an abominable snowman, a humongous praying mantis, a werewolf with a gym-shorts & sneakers, and a genuinely uncanny ventriloquist dummy. My personal favorites, though (as well as those of my six-year-old daughter) where the smirking little garden gnomes. Perfect entertainment for a rainy Halloween afternoon!",Goosebumps

The girl's father is gruff and not accepting of people; the mysterious dad happens to be R.L. Stine (Jack Black), the creator of the bestselling young readers Goosebumps series. Zach accidentally finds out a secret about the author, the monsters in his books are conjured in his fears and stay hidden in the books...until the Stine family library is intruded and a book is haphazardly opened. Now expect monsters of all sizes on the loose.Consider this a fun family flick. Any scares are quite tame and or lame. Most jokes are actually funny enough for adults. Imaginative enough to be a repeat Halloween favorite. Directed by Rob Letterman; plenty of action and color.Also in the cast: Amy Ryan, Halston Sage, Ryan Lee, Steven Kruger and Timothy Simons.",Goosebumps
12,hitchcockthelegend,She's locked in this house and her dad's a psychopath.,6,25 December 2016,"I have to say that being British born and bred I'm not at all familiar with Goosebumps, either the books or TV series etc, so I was going into this film blind as it were. With that in mind I'm not really able to review to fans of the original works.I went in with the hope of a good time, I liked the sound of the concept, I like Jack Black and I knew it was going to be well produced and no doubt heavily laden with the latest technological effects (ironically I had watched the splendid Jason and the Argonauts prior to Goosebumps, from one extreme to another or what?!).I got everything I expected and had fun without any frame of reference. If I wanted any more I could dig out some questions that would need to be answered, but why bother. I left at the end, as a middle aged film lover, contented. I would for sure keenly watch any sequel if it surfaces.Didn't do much for my Automatonophobia though... 6.5/10",Goosebumps
13,LeonLouisRicci,As IntendedA Lightweight and Entertaining Time Passer,7,14 February 2016,"Let's Pretend...We Know Nothing about the Mega-Selling, ridiculously Prolific Series of Children's Horror-Sci-Fi Books and Stories, and for that matter the TV Show Based on the Books. Let's Look at the this Film as an Introduction of sorts or a Stand-Alone Children's Horror-Sci-Fi Movie.The CGI SFX, and there's Plenty, is Not Up to the Usual Standards of Today and look quite Cheesy at times. This may be on Purpose, but that's Doubtful. Anyway, if You give In to that and regard it as a ""Don't want it to be too scary."" Kind of Thing, it can be quite Colorful and Fun.There is No Shortage of Iconic Characters bouncing In and Out of the Story and the Film's Frame, and Everything Moves along at a Never Stand-Still Pace. The Movie Story is Compelling with its Characters literally Jumping Out of the Pages of the Books and Reeking Havoc.Jack Black (playing R.L.Stine the Author of the series) is almost on Autopilot and is hardly Challenged Artistically, but seems to be Having Fun. Overall, the Movie is a sort of a Happy-Meal, lightweight Snack, that is Never too Horrifying and Never Terrifying, it's just sort of a Time Passer with enough Gusto to Entertain but Nothing that Clever is ever Introduced and the Monsters are so Familiar as to be Nothing more than Naughty or Irritating AcquaintancesThis just Might Work as an Introduction to R.L Stine's body of Work for those that Need to be Informed of the Cultural Splash that took place a few Decades Ago and Made its Way Into many a School Libraries and Kids Imaginations.",Goosebumps
14,oscaralbert,North Korea is NOT Detroit . . .,7,22 October 2015,". . . even if Basketballer Dennis Rodman feels equally at home in both places. As GOOSEBUMPS opens, ""Zach Cooper"" asks his mom Gail why she did not get a high school vice-principal job in ""North Korea or Detroit,"" instead of ""Madison, DE"" (GOOSEBUMPS was ACTUALLY filmed in Madison, GA). The Coopers' new hometown features an abandoned amusement park which still has thousands of functioning lights. In Detroit, any WORKING amusement park would go belly up quickly, since copper electrical wire strippers (a.k.a., ""scrappers"") would strand people atop the Ferris wheel every night. In North Korea, strippers are shot on sight. Speaking of Ferris wheels, the climax of GOOSEBUMPS occurs on and around one. Detroit's Interstate 94 is notorious for multi-vehicle pile-ups, many caused by the Giant Tire Ferris Wheel installed there as a roadside distraction after it headlined the 1964-1965 New York World's Fair. Today it's drawing way too much attention, whether or not it's breaking free from its moorings. North Korea has no evil Ferris wheels. GOOSEBUMPS is just another chapter in Sony Corp. of Japan's plot to stir up a nuclear World War III between North Korea and America, in revenge for Japan losing WWII. This nefarious plan, which has been in motion for years, previously was highlighted by last year's infamous Sony Studio's offering, THE INTERVIEW. Therefore, on behalf of all Americans, I'm duty-bound to apologize to North Korea: you're not REALLY as bad as Detroit!",Goosebumps
15,view_and_review,"My Characters Come to Life, I Choose Monsters",6,31 January 2016,"I rented ""Goosebumps"" for my kids. Even still, I like to enjoy the kids movies too. ""Goosebumps"" wasn't great but it was decent.Most people already know the premise of the movie. The featured creatures of the R.L. Stine novels come to life when the book is opened. If you think about it this premise could have been done a bunch of different ways. The main character comes to life when the book is opened... yes, allow your mind to roam.I appreciated one thing in the movie; and that is that the monsters weren't too scary for my kids. The monsters were just animated enough, just quirky enough and just unorthodox enough to not be terrifying. The last thing I wanted was for my kids to not be able to sleep, or worse yet, never open a book again. I can deal with my kids being insomniacs but not illiterate.",Goosebumps
16,neil-476,Very enjoyable,8,12 February 2016,"Cute Hannah lives next door to the house Zach and his mother move into, but she seems to be kept prisoner by her secretive and hostile father. On hearing screams, Zach and his nerdy wimpy friend Champ break in and investigate, only to discover that Hannah's dad is RL Stine, writer of the Goosebumps books, all of which magically contain their monsters in the locked original manuscripts. Unless someone inadvertently unlocks them and lets the monsters loose....The Goosebumps books are what one might term juvenile horror fiction - mildly scary stories for youngsters who aren't yet old enough to be called Young Adult. And this film pitches firmly at that same audience (sensibly) while providing sufficient interest, amusement and eye candy for older, and possibly (though not necessarily) more discerning, viewers.This is great fun. Rather than adapt specific books, this movie takes aim at Stine's entire oeuvre, and wraps it into an Inkheart-type plot, albeit transplanted to modern American suburbia and high school locations. The special effects are plentiful and excellent (although it is a live action movie, it is co-credited to Sony Animation), there is some enjoyable stuff in the script, the odd plot development which isn't necessarily what you expected, and decent playing from the cast, especially Ryan Lee as Champ, a completely believable nerd.And the 3D, though not essential, is quite good.",Goosebumps
17,morrison-dylan-fan,Leap from the page.,7,22 March 2016,"With Goosebumps recently having reached UK cinemas,I was pleased to discover that the film was already out on Region 1 DVD,with the cost of importing it being far cheaper than getting a family ticket,which led to me getting ready for my arms to be covered in goosebumps.View on the film:Taking 20 years to reach the screen,the screenplay by Darren Lemke/Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski's adaptation of R. L. Stine's novels contains a surprising level of fizz,as the writers are joined by an energetic score from Danny Elfman which keeps the spooky chase moving at a slick pace.Surrounding the movie with some of Stine's most famous monster,the writers smartly use Stine's spooky offerings for a delightful Adventure tale,as new monster/obstacle that pops out leads to the gang having to find a new way to escape its deadly clutches.Finding a good spot for a terrific tribute to Gulliver's Travels,director Rob Letterman and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe pick up on the atmosphere in the screenplay by covering the title in bright crayon reds and greens which firmly place the film in Adventure Movie mode. Along with the family Adventure side, Letterman also displays a good eye for bringing the Goosebumps monsters to stylish,spooky life.Reuniting with Letterman after 2010's Gulliver's Travels, Jack Black gives a very good (somewhat) restrained performance as Stine, (and the voice of Slappy & Invisible Boy)thanks to Black's held-back voice giving Stein a quiet creepiness,as the Goosebumps go bump in the night.",Goosebumps
18,anaconda-40658,It Didn't Give Me Goosebumps.,3,1 December 2015,"Goosebumps (2015): Dir: Rob Letterman / Cast: Jack Black, Dylan Minnette, Odeya Rush, Ryan Lee, Amy Ryan: Idiotic family film crap with a mess of special effects and no attention to actual story. Dylan Minnette plays typical teenager Zach who arrives in town with his widowed mother who has just accepted vice-principal duties at the local high school. He meets the girl next door, Hannah, played by Odeya Rush but her father forbids their contact and warns Zach to stay away. Jack Black gives the one passable character as author R.L. Stine whose books are locked but once unlocked untold horrors are unleashed but nothing compared to the travesty the screenwriter unleashes here. We have a variety of frightening monsters wreck havoc and Stines races about trying to trap them back within the pages for which he wrote them. Unfortunately Slappy the puppet is burning the books thus leaving Stine with one choice and that is to rewrite a story that conquers them. Rob Letterman previously directed a superior monster film called Monsters vs Aliens. This one involves monsters popping out of books much like Jumanji when they popped out of a board game. Black carries the film as Stine, whose childhood horrors became the targets for his books while loneliness set in. The rest of the characters do nothing more than run and make narrow escapes. The special effects are the key here and they are passable at best but unfortunately do not save the film. It promises frights for older children tying into their creepiest nightmares while adults may wish to do with this film as done with the books within. Burn it. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Goosebumps
19,FlashCallahan,He's the new drama teacher........,8,12 December 2015,"Upset about moving from the big city to a small town, Zach finds a hint of happiness when he meets neighbour Hannah. Zach is surprised to learn that Hannah's mysterious father is R.L. Stine, the famous author of the best-selling ""Goosebumps"" series. When Zach accidentally unleashes the monsters from the fantastic tales, it's up to Stine, his daughter and Zach to return the beasts back to the books where they belong........With a plethora of characters and narrative, it was always going to be a difficult sell to make a standalone movie, and thank heavens that they went done the same route that Craven did when he made 'New Nightmare' twenty one years ago, because Goosebumls is easily the most fun family horror movie released since Monster House.It's thanks to the fact that the first act doesn't hang around and build up the relationship with the neighbours, the pending teenage romance with the two leads, and the fact that Zach has appeared to have just lost his father, and his mother is the new Vice Principal of the school he has just happened to join (in fact, the last two points are never really bought up again after the introduction).Nope, we more or less go straight into the unleashing of the beasties, and once we meet the abominable snowman, it doesn't let up until the end.Obviously the makers have referenced a lot of Joe Dante's work, noticeably Gremlins and Small Soldiers, and I'm surprised that Spielberg didn't have anything to do with it, because it has that wonderful feel of those movies from the eighties where the children went on some glorious adventure, while the parents stay at home (see The Goonies).Black hasn't been on great form of late, he seemed to have lost that anarchic edge he had in the noughties, and while his version of Stine is almost down the straight and narrow, it's his incarnation of Slappy that really harks back to the Black we all knew and endured in High Fidelity, and School Of Rock. It's a pretty scary movie to be fair as well, the scene in the supermarket with the wolf is suitably tense, and the Zombie-fest in the cemetery would give anyone under the age of ten nightmares.So all in all, it's one of the best family films that Pixar hasn't made for a long time, and there is something here for everyone.Part The Monster Squad, Part Gremlins, this is the type of film that our children will remember when they are our age and look back with a fond memory.It's a shame about the Stine Cameo though, he may has well have held a sign saying 'I'm the actual person that Black is playing, and I play a character called Mr Black!! As in Jack! How Meta is that?'But it would have been a big sign.",Goosebumps
20,Wuchakk,Fun family quasi-horror,7,5 April 2016,"Released in 2015, ""Goosebumps"" chronicles the events of a teenager (Dylan Minnette) who moves to small town Madison, Delaware, where he hooks up with a cute neighbor (Odeya Rush), the daughter of grouchy teenage horror author R. L. Stine (Jack Black). Adventure and horror ensue when the writer's imaginary monsters are unwittingly looses on the town. Ryan Lee co-stars as a nerdy sidekick with Halston Sage as his wannabe babe. Jillian Bell and Amy Ryan are also on hand.Believe it or not, I've never read any of R.L. Stine's popular books or viewed any of the corresponding videos, but I've always wanted to because they looked like fun, youth-oriented quasi-horror adventures, like Scooby Doo without the dog. Interestingly, the movie doesn't adapt one of Stine's stories, but rather has a plot that utilizes myriad of his (non) scary creations, like the abominable snowman, a creepy puppet, an ee-vil clown, a giant praying mantis, a werewolf, and so on. The plot is reminiscent of 1995's ""Jumanji,"" but with the fun-horror trappings of 2006' ""Monster Night"" or ""Scooby Doo"" (but, again, without the dog). The main cast is a highlight with everyone shining in their roles, particularly cutie Odeya Rush, not to mention Halston sage in a small role. I like the revelation about one of the protagonists in the final act and the warmth that develops between the main characters. This is a good movie to unleash your inner-teenager and have a (non) spooky amusing time. The movie runs 103 minutes and was shot in towns east and north of Atlanta, Georgia (Conyers, Gainesville, Madison and Marietta).GRADE: B",Goosebumps
21,siderite,Failed to create the magic required to make people enjoy the real Goosebumps,5,7 December 2015,"I was never acquainted with the Goosebumps children's books and this film sounded like a good way to understand where it is coming from. Well, from the movie I understand it is a total scam of other stories featuring werewolves, mummies, devouring blobs, talking dummies, giant insects, invisible men and zombies. Is it? I have no idea, because the film certainly doesn't want me to read the stories.Full disclosure, I almost hate Jack Black. The few movies where he was funny fail to compensate for the ton of horribly acted horrible films that he has played in. Like similar actors, say... Adam Sandler, I have no idea why he was still employed. However, in this film he was reasonable as the less comedic and more dramatic role of R.L.Stein.This doesn't really mean much. The lead actor, Dylan Minnette, is obnoxious and every scene he delivers feels fake. Similarly - although I have to admit his horrible role required it - his useless sidekick, played by Ryan Lee. Odeya Rush was decent, but the film probably damaged her career, too.The plot is lazy as hell. You can see the events happening way before they do with the few laugh lines being kind of pathetic puns. The film doesn't find it's role between horror, comedy and market placement, so it's none of them.In the end people that you don't care about do things you don't care about, while being played by actors you don't care about and based on books that you will never read, because after this film you certainly don't care about doing it.",Goosebumps
22,StevePulaski,"A rare, worthwhile horror film for the family",8,16 October 2015,"R.L. Stine's beloved ""Goosebumps"" series of books were pivotal books in the lives of millennials; I remember at least a couple kids in every one of my elementary school classes reading Stine's eclectic, twisty mysteries (I, myself, started on ""Friday the 13th"" and slasher films much younger than I probably should have, so ""Goosebumps"" always seemed like childish-fare to me). Nonetheless, a film adaptation - which surprisingly took this long to come about - caters to the genre of ""kiddie horror"" or ""tween horror,"" a largely neglected, and frankly financially uncertain, genre of film that always seems to have its mind on creativity and adventure than anything else.""Goosebumps"" is very reminiscent of nineties TV movies one would find on Nickelodeon or the Disney Channel; it evokes the kind of cheery sentiment of network premieres that were the talk of the lunch table in elementary school. Its ability to rekindle the kind of charm of the series whilst creating something that's pleasantly manic and a bit creepy without being too cheeky or immature shows that this kind of filmmaking hasn't gone by the wayside just yet.The story revolves around Zack Cooper (Dylan Minnette), a teenager who moves from New York City to a sleepy town in Delaware with his mother following his father's untimely death. He quickly meets his neighbor, a bitter and elusive grouch (Jack Black) with a beautiful teenager daughter named Hannah (Odeya Rush). One day, while convinced that her father has abused her after hearing screaming and yelling from the home, Zack calls the police to the home, which leaves everyone but Zack to believe it was a giant misunderstanding.As a result, Zack sneaks in the house one day to see if Hannah is all right when her father isn't there. When Zack knocks a book off a shelf and it unleashes the abominable snowman, he realizes Hannah's father is R.L. Stine, the acclaimed author of the ""Goosebumps"" book series. Suddenly, all of Stine's monsters are released from his books, everyone from the invisible boy to Slappy the Dummy (both characters voiced by Black, as well), which results in mass chaos for the entire state of Delaware.Jack Black plays a very rare and interesting role here, one that allows him to be pretty morose and angry, two traits he doesn't really exercise quite often, if ever. The refreshing change for his overblown personality results in ""Goosebumps"" being another showcase for his versatility and incandescent energy levels that never seem to be crippled, regardless of whatever script or director he's working with.And with a backdrop of numerous different monsters, quirky teenagers, and some very fun sequences, particularly when the group tries to evade the werewolf in the supermarket, the results are usually very favorable. ""Goosebumps"" bears incredibly high energy levels and a nonstop sense of manic fun, which keeps it a fluid and fun project, often carefree and pleasantly not attempting to instill any kind of self-aware, meta humor to what should be a simple endeavor for families.",Goosebumps
23,KineticSeoul,Some good family flick humor,7,22 January 2017,"This is basically a monsters movie with the combination of a lot of the ""Goosebumps"" monsters coming to life. For the most part I was entertained and if I saw this as a kid in elementary I would have loved it. Mainly because the ""Goosebumps"" books was really popular when I was in elementary. And a movie that combines a lot of the monsters would have been awesome. I can however still see kids having a fun time sitting through this one. Because it isn't full of trashy and overly corny dialogues that even kids would cringe at. Instead the humor for the most part works for a family film. What would have been great is if they delved more into the monsters background and how it effects the lead characters. Maybe such as if they have to go through a haunted house or had one of the characters put on The Haunted Mask which effected the group. Instead of just running around and hiding from the the ""Goosebumps"" monsters. I still think this is a good family flick that had potential to be really good. At least the humor for the most part hits it's mark.7/10",Goosebumps
24,Hellmant,Mostly bored.,5,20 November 2015,"'GOOSEBUMPS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The film adaptation of the popular children's book series, by author R.L. Stine (who has a cameo in the movie). It stars Jack Black, as Stine, and deals with all the popular creatures, from his stories, escaping; and wrecking havoc in the town of Madison, Delaware. The movie was directed by Rob Letterman (who also teamed with Black on the kids' films 'GULLIVER'S TRAVELS' and 'SHARK TALE') and it costars Dylan Minnette, Odeya Rush, Ryan Lee, Amy Ryan and Jillian Bell. It was written by Darren Lemke, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. I've never read the books, or seen the TV series based on them, but I wasn't impressed with this movie. Zach Cooper (Minnette) moves to Madison, Delaware, with his mom (Ryan), and isn't happy about it. Then he meets his neighbor, Hannah (Rush), and has new hopes for the town. Hannah's father (Black), doesn't want her to have anything to do with Zach though. Zach hears Hannah screaming one night, and breaks into her house, thinking she's in danger; along with another kid from his school (Lee). They find a bunch of locked books, and foolishly open one; releasing an actual monster from inside it.The movie is slow-paced; and filled with silly kids jokes, and unimpressive action scenes. Black is funny in the film, and the computer effects are decent. I was mostly bored with the movie though; and could barely stay awake for it. Fans of the books (and TV show) might be amused though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0-wDtevNo",Goosebumps
25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Straight outta 2002.,6,30 January 2019,"It's perhaps a stroke of near-genius to adapt all of the eponymous books instead of just one, melding them into a meta narrative surrounding their mysterious author set in a world just one step away from our own. This allows for a lot of fan-service; indeed, pretty much every book-bound creature comes out to play and there are even some subtler references that are actually quite well conceived. Still, that's not all that's on display here as the narrative, while basic, provides a good backdrop for a family-friendly 'haunted house'. 'Goosebumps (2015)' is intermittently fun and Black's performance pushes through most of the sillier stuff - such as its main conceit, which is given as much thought as the two lines of exposition that 'explain' it. It also doesn't feel too self-celebratory, even if there are many lines dedicated to the prowess of Stein's prose and his better-than-King worldwide sales. While the CG might seem slightly dated, it is never distracting and the creative creature designs usually take precedent over the way in which they're rendered. To be fair, the story mainly consists of loosely-connected set-pieces, but it ties itself off nicely and doesn't feel too distracted. I will say that, aside from Black and possibly Lee, the cast aren't all that charismatic, mainly because they don't have much to do aside from scream and run away - which they do convincingly. There aren't any real stakes, despite the fact that there should be, and nobody really gets hurt. However, it's usually enjoyable if you just go along with it. I think fans of the books, which I've never read, will probably get more mileage from it, but I still think it's surprisingly decent. 6/10",Goosebumps
26,ThomasDrufke,"Viewers Beware, You're In For No Scare",4,31 October 2015,"Acknowledging upfront that I'm not the target audience, this movie sucks. It's not good, at all. It's unfortunate because the actual story is fascinating. It's similar to the Star Wars prequels in that the story that George Lucas created for those films is really interesting, but the execution was just not there. This film is as cheesy and as poorly written as a Disney Channel Original movie. You can make a kids movie fun for everyone. Just look at everything Pixar and Disney Animation is doing with their films. They appeal to everyone and can be enjoyed by everyone. I don't think Goosebumps does. Though kids will no doubt enjoy the heck out of this movie.The story is centered on Zach, played by Dylan Minnette, who has just moved into a new house with his mom coincidentally right next door to R.L. Stine, the writer of the Goosebumps novels. Naturally, Zach meets Stine's daughter, Hannah, and 'hits it off' with her. But as Zach, his new friend from school, and Hannah accidentally open a few books from Stine's collection, chaos ensues as all of his created monsters terrorize the town. I was looking forward to this specific aspect of the film. I've never read any of his novels though I am familiar with them, but the idea of having all the characters jump from the pages into the real world seemed intriguing. It was very Jumanji esque, which is an endlessly re- watchable film. The problem with Goosebumps is that there's nothing underneath this story. Zach recently lost his father but that wasn't used as a motivation or story telling element later on. There was no heart.There's also several failed attempts at humor. Jack Black is good at these types of roles and he does what he can with the horrendous writing, but it's not enough to save the picture. Amy Ryan, one of my favorite actresses, is good but gets caught up in the forced romance mess with a fellow teacher at the school. My theater was packed and I can never remember a crowd groaning at so many awfully cheesy moments. The monsters are noticeably CGI which makes for no real tension at all. So without characters to care about, not much humor, and CGI monsters, there's nothing much to ride home about with Goosebumps.+Great story idea+Amy Ryan and Jack Black try-Bad writing-Bad CGI-No heart4.7/10",Goosebumps
27,cricketbat,A fun family horror film,8,23 November 2018,"Goosebumps is a fun family horror film. The scares are tame enough for the kids and the jokes are funny enough for adults. This movie makes you want to read the books all over again, which, now that I think about it, is probably one of the main reasons why this movie was made. However, this movie doesn't feel like a cash grab. It feels like a love letter to the works of R.L. Stine. Goosebumps is worthy to join the ranks of other Halloween family favorites such as The Nightmare Before Christmas, Hocus Pocus and, of course, Ernest Scared Stupid.",Goosebumps
28,lesleyharris30,"A Fun, Thrilling Ride for the Whole Family,",8,14 February 2016,"Goosebumps is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's a very original idea and the fun of that never wares off or gets stale, the idea of all of R.L. Stime's wonderful, terrifying creations coming to life is such a risky project for a major Hollywood studio to take on, but it works out, no characters felt underused. One thing I felt this movie was lacking was heart, something that could have made this a nine for me had it been there, a relationship between Stine and Hannah really should have been seen more, we know that he loves his daughter but it could have been emphasised, it was an extra layer that the film could have had, and I felt like its absence was recognised. The cast is all around terrific, Jack Black is the star of the show, of course, in one of his best performances in years, he really channels the famous author and throws away any of his usual acting habits, as well as voicing the main villain, he's also joined by a terrific trio of young actors who are all going to go very far, they all had a likable, charming screen presence. Though it may have needed more heart, Goosebumps is a very fun movie that's thrilling, but not too much for young children, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. After the creations of Goosebumps writer R.L. Stine come to life, it's up to the author, his daughter and two young boys to put them back in to their books. Best Performance: Jack Black",Goosebumps
29,A_Different_Drummer,Sweet but not syrupy,7,14 November 2015,"Actually a hard film to review.Not because of what it does, but in this case because of what it does not do.And what it does not do is maintain the pace and sharp writing of the first 20 minutes. If you watch a lot of films -- and this writer does -- you will notice that the first 20 minutes, before the first monster arrives, sets up a very different movie than what you actually get. And frankly it is a movie I would have liked to see.That said, while this is no Jumanji -- which pretty much sets the bar for these kinds of fantasies -- it maintains a sweet and gentle tone throughout and the actors also do a solid job of connecting with the viewer.The script (4 writers named, and R L Stine seems to be the least involved) starts very strong and ends ... adequate.There are some memorable scenes, my fave is when the lovesick nerd saves the life of the girl he has been obsessing over -- ""silver fillings"" (clever!) And the ending is nice also, no loose ends.Also could possibly be the most commercial film in the history of the medium. I mean, we have all seen biopics -- CHECK. And we have all seen films with outrageous over-the-top product placement. CHECK. But in my many hundreds of reviews this is the first time I have seen a fictional film where the central character in the fictional story is the actual author of the series of books that gave rise to the fiction in the first place -- and he saves the day by (wait for it) ... writing another book!!

32,Reno-Rangan,"Not a unique concept, but the rest were completely surprised me.",6,4 April 2016,"Technically, this was a another version of 'Jumanji', but a different universe. Originally it was not meant to be like that, because it was adapted from a series of children's book of the same name into a single movie. All the characters from the different books (book series) brought into one place, thus 'Jumanji' effect.When the fictional book characters come into the life, a group of youngsters team up to save the town from invasion. A tale that takes place in one day, especially most of the narration was a one night adventure. Totally an unexpected movie, but still not a masterpiece than just entertaining product. Maybe the actors were the reason, especially inclusion of Jack Black was the turn out. His second collaboration with the director after 'Gulliver's Travels'. And not to forget the CGI work was very acceptable for a little production like this.This theme was a very old, but the characters were unique. Maybe it was a box office lucky, but people won't simply acknowledge for useless things. This film's success was the effort of hard work. I won't surprise if they decide to make a sequel. I meant the same team, not the lower grade filmmakers and actors.6½/10",Goosebumps
33,paulclaassen,I'm impressed!,6,19 September 2020,"Since I'm not a big comedy fan, 'Goosebumps' was never high up on my list of movies to see. Also because I'm not a Jack Black fan, and the trailer made the film look like a slapstick comedy. However, I am a big fan of fantasy films, so decided to give 'Goosebumps' the benefit of the doubt.I must confess to being pleasantly surprised. This was not slapstick as the trailer made me belief. On the contrary, there were actually some really funny moments. There were awesome action sequences, great cinematography and wonderful visuals, all of which overshadowed the few slapstick moments it dished up.I must also admit to actually liking Jack Black here. The role of RL Stine suited him perfectly. Dylan Minnette was really good as Zach, the film's protagonist. Thanks to his performance, the film has more seriousness than it probably ought to have. He grounded the film in a way, and was a very likable hero.With regards to the Hannah character (wonderfully portrayed by Odeya Rush), she lent a much deeper back story to an otherwise fantastical story. Her character had twists I never anticipated. The romance in the film is also quite sweet, and didn't feel forced or annoying - which so often happens to be the case with Hollywood films.From the film's very beginning, it is mysterious and mystical, and quickly spins out of control. I thoroughly enjoyed the myriad of monster characters (the werewolf was my favorite!) This was a rollercoaster ride of fun and excitement. Much better than expected!",Goosebumps

35,leonblackwood,Wasn't that impressed! 3/10,3,24 August 2016,"Review: I really didn't enjoy this film, at all. The acting was pretty bad from the whole cast, especially Jack Black (Stine), who had the worst accent, and all of the annoying teenagers just got on my nerves after a while. No one seemed that surprised that there were loads of ghosts and goblins flying around, and the storyline just went from bad to worse. If the target audience for this film was for kids, then it didn't do too bad in that department but from an adults point of view, the script was awful. On the plus side, the CGI wasn't bad and some of the dolls did freak me out but apart from that, it was a big let down. The actual concept could have made a decent movie, if it was executed well, and I personally wouldn't have chosen Jack Black to play the lead, because we are used to seeing him play outrageous roles, we're he sometimes makes a fool out of himself. Anyway, although the movie didn't look that bad, I did struggle to stay interested throughout, so I won't be rushing to see the sequel. Disappointing!Round-Up: Although I didn't really enjoy this movie, it did make a decent profit at the box office, mainly because it was released when the kids were on holiday but it seemed to come and go out of people's minds. It was directed by Rob Letterman, who also brought you Shark Tale, the decent Monsters vs. Aliens and the disappointing Gulliver's Travels, which also starred Jack Black, so he's obviously has some experience in this genre. With a Goosebumps sequel in the pipeline along with rumours of a Dungeons & Dragons movie, I haven't been impressed with his live action movies to date but I'm sure that he will be pulling in audiences with his upcoming projects. Budget: $58million Worldwide Gross: $150millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/family/comedies starring Jack Black, Dylan Minnette, Odeya Rush, Ryan Lee, Amy Ryan, Jillian Bell and Halston Sage. 3/10",Goosebumps
36,TheMovieDiorama,"Goosebumps may not give you a fright, but has enough delight to supply children with a bump in the night.",5,25 July 2019,"In what may just be the greatest marketing tool for R. L. Stine's series of children's horror novels, Letterman grants us the PG adaptation of 'Cabin in the Woods'. The abominable snowman, a werewolf, evil ventriloquist doll, a colossal praying mantis and even an army of garden gnomes. It's a menagerie of Halloweeny goodness, enough to spark the imagination from the youngest of viewers before the film concludes due to its ridiculous rapid pacing. A group of teenagers and the author of the Goosebumps novels accidentally open various manuscripts that literally transform the ink to reality. With the monsters unleashed, it's up to them to lure the ghouls back in before Slappy the Dummy burns all of the manuscripts, leaving them trapped in the real world forever.If you're like me and have never read a single Goosebumps novel, despite one of the titles being 'I Live in your Basement!' (a phrase I say way too often...), then no need to panic. Turn off Tenacious D, switch over from 'School of Rock' and give it ago. As far as embodying an entire intellectual property goes, Goosebumps is accessible to everyone. Mostly because you'll be enthralled by pointing at the screen and loudly proclaiming ""oh wow, it's a floating vampire poodle!"", and that's where most of the enjoyment lies. The brisk exploration of these creatures, whilst solely powering the plot, brings out the family horror that is the essence of the original source material. Some monsters are better realised than others, the invisible boy and werewolf lacked a certain ""je ne sais quoi"", but on the whole the agglomeration of furry/fleshy/plastic ghouls were intricately designed.The same cannot be said for the human characters however. Unfortunately, the one-dimensional protagonist, his robotically monotonous love interest and his new best friend that irritates more than he entertains, aren't enough to keep me invested in the story. The performances were fine, although Rush was instantly forgettable compared to Minnette and Lee, yet it's the basic screenplay that disallows any personable qualities to be brought forward. The comedy was scattered and rarely landed, mostly because Letterman focused on Black's rip-roaring, insatiable and rather exhausting charisma and the nightly frights. Various plot conveniences, such as Zach's aunt randomly appearing to save the day when the teens were about to be shredded by the werewolf, bring the enjoyment down a smidgen and of course allow for many eye-rolling moments. The third act chucks in as many monsters as possible and diminishes the intensity of the tightly wound second act. Oh, and I counted three jump scares in this family film. Three!So whilst the monstrous thrills were somewhat lacking, the comedy was sporadic and the human characters were more hideous than that pinkish Blob, it does harness the accessibility of Stine's novels and Black is as hyperactive as ever. Which is a good thing, right?",Goosebumps

38,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A messy but surprisingly clever '90s throwback,6,28 April 2016,"Like most '90s fads, I never imagined R.L. Stine's ""Goosebumps"" series would mean anything or be relevant to any generation but mine. So it took me by total surprise to learn Sony/Columbia Pictures was bringing these children's horror books to the big screen for the first time – in 2015.All the more surprising, the film's concept plays to fans of the series that are very familiar with the books, even though it is clearly trying to reach a young audience. Rather than adapting a ""Goosebumps"" story or two for the big screen or developing a new Stine story just for the film, story creators Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (""Ed Wood"") make Stine a main character (played by Jack Black) and craft a ""Goosebumps""-esque premise in which all of Stine's monsters come to life.So there's a healthy amount of self-awareness involved, which screenwriter Darren Lemke and director Rob Letterman bring to their execution of the story that makes it work as light, '90s-style throwback entertainment (complete with a retro Danny Elfman-written score, to boot) despite the absolute silliness and messiness of their movie.Like so many of Stine's ""Goosebumps"" stories begin, Zach (Dylan Minnette) and his mom (Amy Ryan) move to a small town in Delaware. Zach is nervous about fitting in and still getting over the loss of his dad when he meets the girl next door, Hannah (Odeya Rush). Zach is concerned about Hannah and her secretive, controlling father, who turns out to be Stine. Fearing something is wrong, Zach and his new friend Champ (Ryan Lee) break into the Stine house and accidentally open a manuscript, unleashing a Stine monster into the real world.Premise alone should suggest ""Goosebumps"" is a total '90s family adventure film fed through a modern filter. The script never goes on for too long without some kind of clue-in to how ridiculous the whole things is, yet at the same time works hard to provide the thrills and chills of a ""Goosebumps"" book.The performances are also key to creating this effect. Black's quirky portrayal of Stine is just the right amount of exaggerated and weird that he contributes to the film's tone rather than steals from it. The main role belongs to the classic teen protagonist in Zach, but Black bridges the gap from the cliché teenage elements of the story to its goofy, inventive side. The writing also helps, taking the archetypal big-mouthed oddball best friend in Champ and giving him humorous moments that take a surprising direction. The film still plays in familiar territory, but these touches keep it fresh and engaging enough.The movie really makes an effort to embrace the goofy side of ""Goosebumps"" and Stine's imagination. Although zombies and a werewolf make prominent appearances, iconic book series character Slappy the ventriloquist dummy, the abominable snowman of Pasadena, a giant praying mantis and killer garden gnomes also figure into the plot, giving viewers something a little unusual that speaks to the books' originality. For longtime series fans (or people who were huge fans when they were in grade school), that's especially important.""Goosebumps"" features a bare-bones plot with standard execution and a surplus of implausible moments, but the spirit behind the film is spot on. It appeals to nostalgic impulses (whether for ""Goosebumps"" or '90s movies) and with just the right amount of talent behind and in front of the camera is just clever enough to make the time spent worthwhile.~Steven CThanks for reading!

39,lisafordeay,Goosebumps movie 2015 my review,6,17 December 2016,If you were a 90s kid like me well you'd probably have seen the TV show goosebumps. This show used to terrify me as a kid as I found the haunted mask and the dummy episodes scared me so much. Tim Burton wanted to do a film on the show but he turned it down and fast forward to 2015 and Rob Letterman directed a film on the show. Dylan Minnette plays Zach Cooper who moved into a new town along with his widowed mother.Zach notices a strange mam living next door with his daughter and Zach suspects that his a sociopath. Turns out the man is R. L Stine the author of goosebumps played by Jack Black.But when Zach and his school friend Champ sneak into R. L Stines house and accidentally summons a monster off one of R.L Stines books. This also has the evil dummy Slappy also voiced by black who escapes out of the book and summons all the monsters. But will R. L Stine and the gang be able to summon all the monsters back. Overall I thought this film was decent. Jack Black was great in this and the visuals were good. Just think of Jumamji meets Inkheart and you get this flick. The CGI was not too bad either. Too bad all the charcthers weren't in it e.g haunted mask. Good.,Goosebumps

It's a fantastic adventure as Stine and this group of kids attempt to put his monsters back into the books.It's a fun story even if you are not aware of Goosebumps, but I'm sure if you are a huge fan, you'll get a real kick out of seeing some of the monsters from your favorite book make an appearance on the big screen.It's not just a fun film as some of the monsters were real creepy.

Stine-it was also a TV series but I personally have never read the books or seen the show. Dylan plays a teenager that moves to a new town after a tragedy in his family-his mother thinks the change in scenery will be good for him. His new next door neighbor is Jack and his teenaged daughter, Odeya. FYI: Odeya reminds me a lot of a young Mila Kunis. Ryan is a fellow classmate that befriends Dylan. After a few misunderstandings-you know how teenagers can be-Dylan and Ryan accidentally release a strange creature from one of the many enchanted books they find in Jack's house. The books contain the featured character of the book, trapped inside of it, until the book is opened. For instance, a book about werewolves has werewolves inside it. A ventriloquist dummy-voiced by Jack Black, by the way-takes charge after he is set free of his book prison and lets all the other creatures loose, to wreck havoc on the town. Pretty soon, there are ghouls, werewolves, a giant preying mantis and an abominable snowman as well as other creatures that are attacking people. Our heroes have their jobs cut out for them in rounding up all the escaped creatures and saving the town. There is humor and some minor scares for the kiddies. FYI: R.L. Stine makes a cameo appearance near the end of the movie. He walks by Jack and Dylan and Dylan says, 'Who is that?' and Jack says, 'Mr. Black, a new teacher.'

It focused way too much on the weird-looking boring lead character who I just thought found to be really dull, the guy had an uncanny ability to make his face and voice look as disconnected as possible, all of the cast except for Jack Black felt a little off to me, he as the fictionalised version of R.L.

So some of it was enjoyable and did feel like it was on the right track, it just to me very obviously should have been more focused on the R.L. Stine character and the story element of how the monsters came out of his imagination and his writing, perhaps a twist at the end that could've made it a decent picture would have been if the entire thing had turned out to be merely part of a story that R.L. had forgot he wrote and got lost in himself without realising it... It would've certainly been a twist worthy of the books I can tell ya that much.. Something I did appreciate a lot was how it had a fair few different kinds of monsters in it, I found the giant praying mantis to be the most visually impressive and scary. And I'm not saying it was much to write home about but it was wonderful to see a blob monster grace the silver screen again after all these years! The zombies were also pretty well done, they had good makeup effects, quite Walking Dead-esc. I did love Slappy the naughty living dummy, he was fun and was my favourite thing about this movie, it was good to see something practical and real in the middle of all that sloppy animated 'wizardry'. That's something I feel is really lost on today's fantasy and horror films, and even that thing had more personality to it than the cgi creations, you get that from it, even in so small a form, or at least I did. I just gotta say though folks, there was never any evil clown in any Goosebump book, which was a bit of a no-brainer now that I think about it.. Nor did he ever use laser firing killer toy robots! So yeah for me it's kinda fun in spots but it's not a very good movie, it's rather half-assed. And it's certainly no good tribute to the original book series, which I still love a great deal, as they got me into reading as well as monsters and horror movies I believe, and while they may be some of the cheesiest schlock this side of the planet, they also still nevertheless retain their own special magic and to this day have their place in many people's childhoods, and that's something this insipid children's movie could never hope for. And I'm not that jaded it was f****n' boring! It seems like it came a few decades too late if you ask me, the heyday of the books was a long time ago, this effort doesn't even seem to care or take all that much interest in its inspiration..but I begrudgingly guess that at least its heart is in the right place. Sigh, unnecessary Goosebumps movie you are hard to love, but you're even harder to hate! Cute but nothing I'll be running to see again anytime soon.

46,lukem-52760,EXCELLENT HORROR COMEDY FANTASY FUN!!!,7,24 February 2019,"I grew up loving the Goosebumps books from back in the 90's & loved the fun creepy little tales set in suburban neighbourhoods & i always loved the creepy slappy dummy best out of the monsters anyway I'm into my 30's now & was still excited when i heard about a proper Goosebumps movie coming out.I watched Goosebumps with my kids & it's a well made very fun fantasy Horror adventure i loved it!!!!
The comic genius Jack Black was perfect as R.L.Stine he plays the real life Goosebumps writer with a frantic quick witted craziness & full of fun i loved his take on the Horror writer legend.
The kids are great in the cast especially new comer Dylann minette he's a great actor & proved himself as a serious intense actor in the instant classic Horror Thriller Don't Breathe (2016) & the rest are all good & fun but he stands out as a future big lead actor.
Goosebumps has that nice fun 80's monster creature feature feel to it & a nice sense of wonder & adventure!!!
A great family film & a great Goosebumps movie with heart.",Goosebumps
47,peterp-450-298716,Maybe entertaining for 10 year olds ... I thought it was a bit too crowded in the end,4,2 March 2016,"""It's like stop trying to be Stephen King, man. Let me tell you something about Steve King. Steve King wishes he could write like me, and I've sold way more books than him, but nobody ever talks about that!""Lets organize a pleasant afternoon and watch a soft horror movie with the whole family. Why wouldn't we use the oeuvre of R.L. Stine? This writer wrote a whole series of books known as the famous Goosebumps. And to circumvent the obstacle of choosing a book, they just used all of them in the same film. What you get to see is a horde of horror figures, planning to destroy the human world. From small, annoying gnomes to a giant grasshopper. There are some less successful creations and there are also some highly amusing creations like Slappy, the Yeti and the werewolf with basketball shoes. The end result is a Jumanji-like kids-movie in which the main actors must do their utmost best to straighten out this crooked situation.I wasn't really impressed though. Probably because I'm not part of the target group. The bland romantic part and the attempt to make it adventurous, obviously wasn't meant for me. It might be a bit too scary for the youngest among us (although it wasn't overly creepy). Pubers however might think it's a bit too soft. I appreciated the rare moments when the humor became tremendously sharp and shrewd, like the opening scene and the Stephen King remark for example. Even the humorous interactions of the scrawny little fellow Champ (Ryan Lee) who tries to fix everything along with Zach (Dylan Minnette) and Hannah (Odeya ""The Giver"" Rush), was acceptable. The only thing that started to get on my nerves after a while, was him using that effeminate scream for the umpteenth time.""Goosebumps"" guarantees an entertaining afternoon at the local cinema for young people. Even adults who accompany them, could have some fun with it. There are some memorable parts such as the werewolf fragment in the supermarket. Long time since I've seen such a perfectly choreographed scene where real actors and animated characters interact with each other. Blood-curdling exciting and flashy. Yep it gave me goosebumps. Unfortunately in the end it turned into a real mess. It was a bit too much of everything. A flood of Stine's literary creations. And Jack Black, who plays the grumpy hermit Stine, stuck to his routine of not being funny. It's probably me, but if you want me to be depressed, just let me watch ""School of Rock"". Success guaranteed.""Goosbumps"" won't be such a huge success as a fantasy and horror film. It seemed to me that the idea to cram Stine's creations into the same movie, wasn't exactly the most brilliant idea. The best is the enemy of the good. Fortunately, they didn't use this idea for the Harry Potter books. Perhaps the creators biggest intention was to promote reading a book again. Maybe they partially succeeded in that. Unfortunately this self-promotion also worked disadvantageous when you look at the special effects and the story structure. All in all it's a must see for ten year olds. Maybe I re-watch it with my son in five years. He can have his uninhibited opinion about my humble opinion!More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Goosebumps
48,TheOneThatYouWanted,A review form someone who has never read the novels,6,4 December 2015,Meh. This is your average teenage comedy/soft horror adventure flick. I went to see it with someone who loved the novels growing up and they thought it was as average as I thought it was. Whatever you take from watching the trailer is what you're going to think of the movie. I'll say it is a well directed and acted movie for what it is trying to be. Jack Black does a good job in it and has fun with his role. Nice to see Jack Black still making live action movies. The plot for the film is enough. The action in this film is mostly fast paced shots of people running away from whatever monster. The special effects are very well done. You can still that most of the budget for this film was spent of the effects. I wouldn't waste money watching it unless you are a hardcore fan of the novels.,Goosebumps
49,Seraphion,Nostalgic points indeed,7,27 October 2015,"Zach and his mom just moved into Madison, Delaware. He meets his neighbor Hannah, a home-schooled girl. One night she shows him an abandoned amusement park. Her father warns him not to see her again. He then sees their shadow on the window, arguing when she suddenly screams, making him call the cops. The father disproves his claims, but then he tricks him to go out, and Zach sneaks in; taking a new friend Champ who's passing by. They found a collection of locked Goosebumps manuscripts. Champ suspects something but Zach dismisses it, opening the lock with a key. Hannah comes finding the opened book, which suddenly has its title monster, the abominable snowman, jumps out from the pages. It runs out after tearing out a wall. Zach and Champ follow Hannah chases it to a hockey rink. She explains it can be locked back in the book if they open the book on it. They get cornered by it but the father opens the book behind it, locking it back into the book.Back at Hannah's place they find another book, Slappy's, has been accidentally opened. Slappy greets them and soon runs away with the rest of the books after burning his own book. Slappy starts opening the books and burning them after the monsters in them get out. Hannah, Zach, Champ and the father face a batch of evil gnomes and escape. In the car father reveals himself as the Goosebumps writer R.L. Stine. He explains the cause behind the monsters being real. They shake off the invisible boy and escape a giant locust into a supermarket, only to find a werewolf. Zach's aunt Lorraine saves them and Zach tells her to warn the town while they take a shortcut to find Stine's special typewriter in Zach's school to let him write another book to catch all the monsters back. They escape ghouls in the cemetery shortcut, and Zach discovers Hannah is also Stine's creations.In the school Zach confronts Stine about Hannah. They find the typewriter and Zach and Champ warns the school dance. The giant locust confirms Zach's warning. Slappy focuses the monsters advance to the school, setting free more monsters and burning more books. The school gets barricaded but the monsters advance easily. Champ helps a girl from the werewolf. Slappy confronts Stine, breaking his fingers and stopping him from finishing the new book. The whole school gets cornered, so Stine, Hannah, Zach and Champ lures the monsters away while they flee to the amusement park. Slappy sets fee the blob so Stine lets himself gets captured as bait while Hannah and Zach get to the ferris wheel and finish the story. But as the new book sucks all the monsters back in, so does Hannah gets sucked in. Stine gets a job at the school, and apparently he wrote another book, a rewrite on Hannah, bringing her back to reality.Well, now I see why the movie managed to nab top positions in the box office for its first weeks. It was able to gain in from the combination of factors; the building mood approaching Halloween, the lack of good and worthy Halloween movies, and the sense of nostalgia of the 90s kids who then read the books, like I did. Although the story doesn't really reflect the usual mood of the original books, at least the nostalgia effect kicks in greatly as the appearance of the familiar monsters keeps the old readers to their seats the entire movie.Again I must say that the box office phenomenon will likely be mostly caused by the nostalgic parts, as the story itself lacks the focus the original books had. Having more than one monster or ghost at a time deprives the movie of the common horror formula of recurring threat and instead changes the movie into a quick paced adventure rather than the scary children's horror it use to be.Also the movie doesn't really reflect the full breadth of how Goosebumps can be. I own five Indonesian editions of the book, including the Shock Street, Camp Jellyjam, and Horrorland. It felt very much nostalgic to see Shock Street's locust. But the movie only follows the mainstream Hollywood formula of giving happy endings. I was kind of expecting that the movie may go somewhere wild like how My Hairiest Adventure went.A thing to add is that the CGI looks nice enough to give adequate weight for the monsters to look scary. The acting overall is just adequate to support the movie. Jack Black did enough as the horror author in a more comedic and adventurous movie. He really looks funny even in his threatening lines. Also he did quite a great job in vicing Slappy and The Invisible Boy, maximizing the contrast in them that I didn't recognize it's him until I read the credits. Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush did just okay, their faces are the real reason they landed the roles.My opinion about Goosebumps (2015) is a score of 7 out of 10, which covers mainly the nostalgic parts and the adventurous rush. A recommendation just goes as a so-so say since it's not really a horror movie at all in this Halloween time.",Goosebumps
50,rgkarim,R.L. Stine's Books Brought To Life,7,18 October 2015,"Remember when you were a kid, and your parents told you to read something? Chances are you were like me and chose Goosebumps as your series, enjoying the juvenile horrors it brought. R.L. Stine's band of ghouls, goblins, and dummies left me with chills many years ago, along with many memorable stories to enjoy. Now years later, following reprints, spin-offs, and more reprints a movie surrounding Stine's creatures has emerged, and just in time for Halloween. What thrills, or chills, does this installment have for audiences? Read on to find out. For those who grew up with the series, the main benefit this movie brings is a sense of nostalgia. Director Rob Letterman has placed iconic monsters (such as Slappy, Werewolf of Fever Swamp, and Lawn Gnomes) throughout the movie that will take you on an adventure that screams R.L. Stine. I felt the crew did a nice job integrating some of the characters into the story, providing plenty of ""exciting"" moments that young and young at heart will enjoy. Many of these scenes make a reference to a part in the book, be it in the form of a quote, iconic scene, or some other mark representative of our monsters. Unfortunatelythey limited their monsters to only a few of Stine's horror champions, reducing others to quick cameos that lasted mere seconds. I'm knew that it would be impossible to adequately provide all sixty four books proper screen time in 103 minutes, but was hoping for a few more appearances. The second strength of Goosebumps is how fun the story is. It's a very simplistic adventure that after a cliché' opening gets pretty exciting. Chases through grocery stores, battling ceramic ornaments, and attempting to escape the clutches of massive mantis are just some examples of the bouts our heroes go through. The plot is of course obvious, but is certainly representative of an R.L. Stine plot. There are a few highly predictable twists in the film, but there are a few lessons that will hit home to audiences of all ages. Humor was injected into the sequences as well, mostly juvenile antics and over the top screaming that had little kids screaming in delight. However, there are a few witty puns and lines dropped at the right time that got some laughs from the older generation. All of the fun takes away from the ""scariness"" of Slappy and his crew, and wraps the whole film in a cute package. Acting wise our cast has done their jobs of bringing the kids series to life. Jack Black was by far my favorite of the crew, capturing both the look and persona I envisioned of the famous writer. Black's theatrical, overdramatic delivery works well in this film, building up the comedy in the scenes and adding some punch to the punch lines. He even does some voice acting in the film, bringing some humorous elements to Slappy and the Invisible Boy but still adding a little menacing atmosphere to the mix. Dylan Minnette's performance as a struggling teenager was spot on, and was perhaps the most balanced character of the bunch. He held his emotions in check, and made for a relatable hero to latch on to. The lovely Odeya Rush helps ground the silliness and excitement, resetting the moment to keep the adventure fun instead of overbearing. As for Ryan Lee, well his role is the opposite of Rush's, primarily escalating the scene to ridiculous levels with screaming, panicking, and more screaming. He was funny at times, but his characters antics got old after a while. Filming wise the movie is has decent quality, in both special effects and camera work. The animation and design of the monsters is decent, personalized to mimic their expected natural movements. Slappy moves in a jerky, blocky, and somewhat stiff motion much like you would see in a ventriloquism dummy. However, the werewolf's digital design is sleek, with fierce, fluid movements seen in wolves. The camera work is also decently stable, only going into a chaotic frenzy once or twice during the adventure. Our team maximizes the intensity and emotion in each scene, making sure to use the best angles to film the scene. There are numerous shots that are obviously designed for the 3-D version of the film, many of them involving something coming out of the screen to ""terrorize"" the audience. At this point I will say I don't see a need for watching this movie in 3-D, but for the full cinematic effect you'll need to spend the extra cash. Overall Goosebumps is a fun Halloween adventure that families will certainly enjoy. Nostalgia runs deep in the veins of this movie, and fans like me will enjoy the adventure Hollywood has set up for us and be thoroughly entertained. Would I recommend a trip to the theater? For the special effects and fun, yeah I would recommend it, especially in the 2-D version. It is at least worth a NetFlix or RedBox rent whenever it joins their library in the future. My scores for Goosebumps are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",Goosebumps
51,rannynm,"Great Story, Brings Together All the Book Characters into One Place",10,14 October 2015,"I love this movie! It starts when Zack (Dylan Minnette) and his Mom move from New York to Madison, Delaware not long after his Dad dies. Their house is right next door to a very odd neighbor, but Zack meets the neighbor's daughter, Hannah (Odeya Rush) and she shows him a really cool abandoned amusement park. On his very first day of school, he meets a kid named Champ (Ryan Lee). Later that night, Zack hears Hannah screaming next door and he calls Champ to help him check it out. Champ thinks he's coming over to meet girls and his reaction to finding out he's been asked to help save Hannah is very funny. They sneak in and that is when the adventure begins. This story has many cool Goosebumps characters including Slappy (aka the Living Dummy), the Invisible Boy, the Haunted Car, the Abominable Snowman, Werewolf of Fever Swamp and the Blob that eats everyone.The cinematography and special effects are amazing. I especially liked when the ink flies off the pages of the book. The monsters look great and have a lot of detail. They look very real. I have to admit, I am a big fan of the Goosebumps books and they have excelled at making a movie that is true to the books. I also love the acting. It is one of the perfect things about the movie. They react like some one really would in a similar situation. This movie is kind of scary. There are some jump scares. But, it is funnier than it is scary. There are many jokes such as when Champ says ""Most teenagers aren't afraid of death, but I was born with the gift of fear. When I was four and put on a swing, I thought, so this is how it ends."" I like the music. It really suits the mood of the film, creating suspense throughout the film. During Zach's first day of school, the music is happy just like you feel on the first day of a new school year. Goosebumps is a great story and will be enjoyed by many different ages. I definitely think you should check it out, especially if you love the books. I recommend this for ages 7 to 18 because younger kids could get scared. I give Goosebumps 5 out of 5 stars because I loved the story line, the great music, the acting and the special effects! Reviewed by Nathaniel B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, ages 9.",Goosebumps
52,Kingslaay,Childhood memories,7,3 June 2019,"I like many were fortunate to grow up at a time when Goosebumps hit the reading world by storm. In fact, it's what got me into reading and I'm grateful. Definitely good memories.Overall a decent film, I feared they would oversell the childish teenage lifestyle but they did well for the most part. Odeya Rush is a beautiful addition to the film and does well. Great to see all the monsters being brought to life with Slappy at the forefront. Only criticism is they could have kept it a little darker and not gone full PG for the kids by showing a romantic teenage arc in the end with Dylan and Odeya. You should left it well alone. Still decent and enjoyable. 7/10",Goosebumps
53,quincytheodore,Just the right amount of nostalgia and campy fun.,7,20 October 2015,"For most movies, being formulaic would be a flaw. This is not the case with Goosebumps, it takes full advantage of the nostalgia effect and instead of going for edgy dark atmosphere, it stays within the boundary of its fun juvenile antics. It brings mild comedy of horror with surprisingly decent visual effect as well as healthy amount of witty jokes.The set-up itself will be a reminiscence of retro horror and 90s gimmicks. From the quiet suburban life where the sneaker-wearing teen protagonists would wander off due to boredom, the strangely oblivious adults who only realize the dire problem far too late and all the PG-13 monsters, it just reeks of nostalgia. However, the movie also balances this with a few modern touches so it would be accessible to previous and current generation.Plot isn't complicated, the trailer or synopsis pretty much script the whole thing. Monsters from the book roam a once peaceful city and a merry band of teens must save it from destruction. There are a few developments here and there, but none too major or shocking which is understandable for family movie. Granted, there are a couple of plot holes or a few scenes where it feel too frantic, but audience would mostly be lenient considering the silly nature of the movie.Its greatest asset aside nostalgia is the humor. The cast does a fine job delivering the timely quips and awkward situations even during chaotic danger, or rather it works from the irony of being in such danger. There's surprisingly good chemistry between them, beyond just stereotypical teen escapades. Jack Black does his usual eccentric persona. While it's not great, it's presentable, plus the movie needs a big name for push.Goosebumps is arguably predictable and can be hectic at times, yet it has sufficient nostalgia charm and witty humor for an entertaining family oriented adventure comedy.",Goosebumps
54,Screen_Blitz,A spooky good time for kids and adults,7,30 May 2016,"This comedy-horror adventure is almost everything book fans may come to expect from a live action adaptation of the popular children's horror series by R.L Stine, spooky imagery, the creepy tongue-in-cheek tone, and of course an abundant CGI madness. Director Rob Letterman is a veteran for making family oriented movies, though not all have turned out positively, 'Gulliver's Travels' for instance. This quirky fantasy flick based on the books by R.L Stine however, demonstrate the good side of Letterman's directorial filmography. This follows sixteen year old Zach Cooper (played by Dylan Minnette) who moves to a small town in Delaware with his mother (played by Amy Ryan) who is starting her position as the vice principal at his new school. Next door he meets Hannah (played by Odeya Rush) who happens to be the daughter of Goosebumps author R.L Stine (played by Jack Black). When and his geeky new friend Champ (played by Ryan Lee) open up one of the books accidentally releases the monsters who come to life and wreck havoc on their town, it is up to R.L Stine, Zach, Hannah, and Champ to save the town and put an end to the wild monster madness.This is not the first time R.L Stine's book series has been subject to a screen treatment as the series was met with a short-lived television series that began and ended in the mid- 1990s, though occasionally aires each year during the approach of Halloween. This film on the other hand, is the better deal. It succeeds on delivering quirky, energetic fun while wielding a fair amount of smart humor to the table. With the film relies mostly on action and Jumanji-esque mayhem than actual scares, there is nothing short of CGI galore; plenty of computer-animated monsters to feed. Giant spiders, aliens with freeze guns, killer gnomes, goblins, werewolves, an evil ventriloquist doll, you name it; all brought to life in fine CGI, though nothing groundbreaking. And the result are sequences full of fun and surprises that may take some viewers back to the memory of 'The Monster Squad' from the 80s, though there is no Dracula, Frankenstein, or greasy sewer monsters. Of course, there are a few cons to be handed here. The humor is not always funny as it should be, and this includes some of the adult jokes thrown in here and there, some of which can get slightly annoying; especially if you are not amused by geeky comic relief of Ryan Lee's character. But when it's funny, it works. The casting of Jack Black as R.L Stine is somewhat odd but to much surprise, he fits quite well in the role. Though he's not known for playing such quirky roles like these, it comes to show that Black demonstrates fair commitment when adapting outside his comfort zone. Goosebumps is a fun, harmless comedy-horror flick that is destined to bring appeal to both kids and adults as well as fans of the book series. Yes, there are some moments that can potentially bring scare to children under the age of seven. Other than that, this movie is worth for family viewing.",Goosebumps
55,Troy_Campbell,"Not memorable, but great in-the-moment fun.",6,19 January 2016,"Rather than adapting a single entry from the enormously popular book series, this film cleverly pays tribute to the novels by embarking on a new adventure that employs a plethora of R.L. Stine's monsters. New kid on the block Zach (Dylan Minnette) and geeky tag-along Champ (Ryan Lee) find their way into a kooky house with a mysterious bookshelf full of locked manuscripts, all of which belong to grumpy recluse R.L. Stine (Jack Black). After Zach and Champ inadvertently unlock a couple of the books, despite the best efforts of Stine's daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush), all hell breaks loose when Stine's collection of written nasties come to life. The plot itself is weak and the jokes are hit and miss, however this spooky yarn is more concerned about spending time with our quartet of heroes as they go into an urban battle against all manner of eerie enemies, à la Gremlins. There's the odd fright here and there to keep the younger audience members on their toes, but it's relatively tame even by PG standards. The main antagonist Slappy, a malevolent ventriloquist dummy, is wonderfully creepy though. The array of monsters on display – including a werewolf, giant ant, abominable snowman, evil clown, vampire poodle, devilish gnomes, ghouls and a haunted car – are predominantly realised in CGI, completed to a satisfactory standard without ever being amazing. Squarely focused on offering cheap thrills for pre-teens and post-toddlers, Goosebumps is an enjoyable in-the-moment escapade.",Goosebumps
56,pyrocitor,Goofbumps,6,26 October 2015,"Ask any '90s kid about Goosebumps (don't you dare call them ""mah fervrit berks!""), and you'll inevitably see them suppress a shudder before responding excitedly. R.L. Stine's franchise of fright was a seminal experience for the generation who learned to stay out of the basement, or say cheese and die – age-appropriate, but so genuinely scary, and clever in their creepiness, to boot, that they came with the titillation of flirting with adult horror, rather than the borderline patronizing feel of most other Scholastic books feel. There was a particular cocktail of apprehension yet addictive excitement that 'Reader beware – you're in for a scare!' invited – and it's in regards to this particular feeling that Goosebumps the movie shows its age.Goosebumps does still court the particular soft-focus hokiness of a '90s movie, but plays itself strictly as a Jumanji remount – a 'greatest hits' CGI-fest episodically subjecting its teen heroes to a gauntlet of Stine's monsters and frights. Is it as flimsy as it sounds? Yes, and even more 'plot-be-damned' than usual to boot, being almost laughably lazy in its attempt to explain or justify its 'books coming to life' premise, even in terms of internal fantasy logic. Is it still worthwhile? Oh sure – the nostalgia helps hugely, but there's plenty of schlocky charm here, and even a decent amount of laughs, though the distinction between chuckling at dire cliché and genuinely well-crafted gags becomes unsettlingly blurred over time. The visual effects are cute in their cartoony clumsiness – the recurring visual effect of monsters being dismantled into ink is squelchy and gruesome, while the monsters themselves are reliably fun. There's a good bit with the lawn gnomes, primary antagonist Slappy theerr ventriloquist is as eerily embodied as ever, the Blob That Ate Everything is surprisingly textured visual feast and creepily cool setpiece, and it's hard to deny the thrill of seeing a giant praying mantis wreaking havoc on the streets (but where is the haunted mask, though? Grr). Even the cast are game to leap into their rote roles with gusto. Jack Black is such a titanic force of energy that even on autopilot he's impossible not to love, and he employs his bug-eyed leering and eerily reedy voice perfectly here as author R.L. Stine (as well as a couple of surprise voice-over roles), letting loose with a triumphantly hysterical Stephen King rant, and even managing to play a fourth-wall-nudging gag better than it had any right to. Dylan Minette, already in danger of being typecast as 'baby Channing Tatum', Odeya Rush, and Ryan Lee are all surprisingly charismatic and credible as the film's requisite '90s-moulded teen leads, committing to character and premise with surprising dedication. Although the material only allows such much – Rush is saddled with too many dreamy 'manic pixie dream girl' stinger lines, while Lee's comic relief screeching inevitably grates over time, all three nonetheless impressively establish themselves, Minnette especially, as actors to watch for in the future. The distinctly odd casting of Amy Ryan as Minnette's mother pays off, as she inhabits the time-worn 'movie mom' archetype with a twinkle in her eye, while Jillian Bell is uncompromisingly demented in the role of 'comic relief aunt', and wins many a laugh in the process. Sure, that's all well and good, you say. But the clincher: is Goosebumps actually scary? Not in the slightest. Goosebumps is a film that made its bed early in the production process to play as traditionally kid-friendly, with plenty of charm, but with scarcely a startling jolt, let alone fright, to offer. Take it as it is – dopey as hell, but with plenty of nostalgic charm – and there's an enjoyably campy evening at the movies to be had. But it's nonetheless hard not to lament that a different scribe didn't get a hold of Stine's magic(?!) typewriter here, and pump out the spine-tingling adventure all Goosebumps aficionados, young or old, know they deserve. Just keep waiting, friends – in time-honoured Stine fashion, there's sure to be a bloodcurdling twist coming soon. -6/10",Goosebumps

58,RforFilm,Goosebumps should provide enough fan service and monster to forgive it's nonstop pace,7,27 October 2015,"Reading is a big part of my life and credit is due where it is deserved. Most might stake their claim on the start of their reading journey to something classic like Shakespeare or maybe something more modern like J.K. Rowling. I heave read those too, but I like to thank the works of R.L. Stine and more particularly, his Goosebumps series. Instead of being a continuing series that tell one big story like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, the Goosebumps books were more like The Twilight Zone anthology where each story told a supernatural scenario that happens to children.It's hard to defend the Goosebumps books as masterpieces and to even say that R.L. Stine was a good writer as many stories were taken from preexisting media, but I got my start here for two reasons. The first was that I learned a lot about classic monsters from this series as they ranged from werewolves to zombies to vampires to talking dummies and even giant bugs. Second was that chapters were always ending on cliffhangers, preventing me from putting them down as I wanted to know what was going to happen next. The books are now coming life in it's own feature film, Goosebumps.Teenager Zach Cooper (played by Dylan Minnette) moves with his mother from New York to small town Madison, Delaware. He meets his next-door neighbor ""Mr. Shivers"" (played by Jack Black) who warns him to stay away. Zach meets two other people; a socially awkward geek Champ (played by Ryan Lee) and Mr. Shivers teen daughter Hannah (played by Odeya Rush) who takes a liking to the new kid. One night, Zach hears Hannah's scream and tries to call the police, but Shivers shoos them away. Zach tricks Shivers into driving to the police station to find out what's going on. Inside, he finds a large shelf full of Goosebumps manuscripts. Before a fine Hannah can stop them, he unlocks a book causing a yeti monster to attack. They lure him to an ice rink where Shivers finds them and sucks the monster back into the book. Zach and Champ figure out that Mr. Shivers is actually Goosebumps author, R.L. Stine. When they get back, they find that the talking dummy Slappy (voiced by Jack Black) is angry and takes all the manuscripts where he unleashes every monster created by R.L. Stine. It's up to the author and the three teens to get the monsters back into the books before they spread chaos around town. Goosebumps could have been an easy dumb kids story, but I'm surprised that the movie is very self aware of it stories and the jokes that they crack. They take several stabs at the writing of R.L. Stine and his work, yet manages to pay enough of a homage that it doesn't seem too mean. While some of the monsters like the yeti and the werewolf are CGI (not rendered that well), the rest look very well, especially Slappy who's both creepy and funny. The story itself is a good set up (kind of a cross between Jumanji and Gremlins) and adapting individual stories are not plausible are most were too short. The problem here is that it moves at such a fast pace that I rarely have a chance to catch up. It's not that trying to spew a lot of plot, but the action scenes are fast to get to another. For what they do though, they are entertaining.Jack Black makes for a good R.L. Stine as does everyone else. The main character Zach could have used more personality, but I didn't mind as the monsters and the author were the real stars and what audience are going to want in the end.I'll give this seven Goosebumps books out of ten. Goosebumps knows who it's audience is; children that read the books and nostalgic fans from the nineties. I probably would have liked it more had it gone darker, but I appreciate Sony for making a spooky movie for families. If you liked the books, then you'll probably enjoy Goosebumps. Just don't expect it to be too scary.",Goosebumps
59,Hollywood_Yoda,Not Just For Kids,8,24 August 2016,"This was really a great movie, especially if you're a fan of the series of books by R.L. Stine. The fact that the movie is in part based on Stine, I found the plot intriguing.Jack Black as a semi-crazy version of Stine was pretty funny. He was almost playing himself, in fact. And Odeya Rush as his daughter Hannah, a much better role than she had in The Giver. Dylan Minnette has a future in the film business, very recognizable, an even better performance than he had in Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.My only hope is that if a sequel is made to this film, it will be as imaginative as the first. And the highlight of it all was the cameo role of R.L. Stine himself.",Goosebumps
60,Anurag-Shetty,"Apt movie to watch on Halloween with your family but, the books & the TV show are better.",7,31 October 2015,"Goosebumps tells the story of a teenager named, Zach(Dylan Minnette). Zach moves to a small town called Madison, Delaware with his mom, Gale(Amy Ryan). Here, he meets his next door neighbors. The famous young adult horror author, R. L. Stine(Jack Black) & his daughter, Hannah(Odeya Rush). One fateful night, the monsters from Stine's famous Goosebumps novels get accidentally released into the town of Madison, Delaware. Now, it is up to R. L. Stine, with the help of Zach & Hannah, to stop the monsters he created, from wreaking havoc in the small town of Madison, Delaware. Goosebumps is a good film. The 3D & special effects are superb. All the famous monsters from R. L. Stine's Goosebumps series look as realistic as possible, thanks to the efforts of the folks at Sony Pictures Animation. The Ferris wheel set piece during the climax, is the highlight of the movie. The kids will definitely enjoy this film more than the adults. This movie is basically just a homage to the original Goosebumps novels. It doesn't retain the creepy element of the books or the TV show, which is based on the books. This movie is mainly a comedy thanks to the presence of stars like, Jack Black. So, don't go for the movie expecting to watch, what you loved reading & watching as a kid. Just think of this film, more as a tribute. However, if you don't like movies that try to make the audience laugh, with childish & slapstick gags then, this movie isn't for you. Jack Black is brilliant as R. L. Stine/Slappy/The Invisible Boy. Black's voice is perfect for the creepy living dummy, Slappy. Dylan Minnette is awesome as Zach. Odeya Rush is great as Hannah. Ryan Lee is hilarious as Champ. Amy Ryan is impressive as Gale. Jillian Bell is amazing as Lorraine. The supporting characters are effective too. Look out for R. L. Stine's cameo in the film. Goosebumps is not a must watch. However, if you want to watch an entertaining & family friendly movie this Halloween, make it Goosebumps.",Goosebumps
61,dave-mcclain,"""Goosebumps"" reflects the books wonderfully in a fantastic original story.",10,17 October 2015,"""Stephen King is no slouch,"" commented a member of the Movie Fan Facebook Page staff. The man has published 60 books, which have sold over 350 million copies. ""Wait a minute,"" you say. ""Why start a review of a movie based on R.L. Stine's books by talking about Stephen King?"" Fair question. Well, Stine has been called ""the Stephen King of children's literature."" Beyond that, you may be surprised to learn that Stine has bested the famously prolific King by publishing hundreds of books, which have sold over 400 million copies! Think about that. It's enough to give you goose bumps. That, of course, is the name of Stine's most popular series of books, brought to the big screen in the film ""Goosebumps"" (PG, 1:43).Fans of the series may wonder which of the books is the basis for the movie. The answer is none of them – and all of them. Rather than adapting any one of Stine's books, which are, admittedly, relatively short (as Stephen King exclaims, ""Ah-HAH! See?""), this film imagines a world in which Stine's monsters come to life and terrorize a small town, while R.L. Stein himself, along with a few local teenagers, attempt to recapture the creatures and save the town. I won't spoil the movie, except to say that, in the end, we Movie Fans get a film that is as exciting and delightful as any of the books that inspired this story.The film has Jack Black portraying Stine as an unfriendly recluse in the tiny (fictional) town of Madison, Delaware. Showing Stine as a movie character which we get to know as a man, but is only a fictionalized version of the real person recalls movies like Charlie Kaufman's 1999 fantasy comedy-drama ""Being John Malkovich"" or Matthew LeBlanc (starting in 2011) playing himself as an adorable jerk in the Showtime comedy series ""Episodes"". Black's Stine calls himself Mr. Shivers. He's a widower who lives in a big house with his kind, but mischievous 16-year-old daughter, Hannah (Odeya Rush), whom he homeschools. Moving in right next door is Madison High School's new assistant principal, recently widowed Gale Cooper (Amy Ryan), and her teenage son, Zach (Dylan Minnette), still grieving the loss of his father. Gale's sweetly clueless sister, Loraine (Jillian Bell) greets them with open arms, but Zach and Gale simply have a lot of adjusting to do – and new people to meet. Gale is almost immediately hit on by shy fellow educator, Coach Carr (Ken Marino), while an awkward nerd ironically named Champ (Ryan Lee) traps the new guy into a friendship. It's a good thing for Zach that Hannah is such a pleasure to be around.One night when Zach looks towards his new neighbor's house and thinks he sees Mr. Shivers abusing Hannah, he calls Champ and they steal into the house. Zach and Champ see that Hannah's okay, but not before they find a key and open a locked ""Goosebumps"" manuscript among many on a shelf in Mr. Shivers' study. The book is ""The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena"" and unlocking the manuscript allows a large, furry creature to literally jump off the page. The three teens run after him, Hannah telling them that the monster can only be re-captured by sucking him back into the book from whence he came. The Abominable Snowman wreaks havoc on the town until Mr. Shivers shows up to save the day.In the destruction that the creature caused in the study, all the manuscripts fell to the floor and one of them popped open – one releasing the evil Slappy the Dummy. Slappy unleashes complete mayhem in Madison – on the night of a big high school dance nonetheless. The police (a hilarious Timothy Simons and Amanda Lund) are no help, but few people would be. That ventriloquist dummy serves as the ringleader of a gang of dangerous and destructive creations including a wolfman, a maniacal clown, a herd of garden gnomes and a gargantuan praying mantis. They all want revenge on their creator for keeping them locked up so long. And Stein is the only one who even has a chance of stopping them. When Stine's creations come to life, besides clear memories of Robin Williams' 1995 hit ""Jumanji"", this situation reminds us of Emma Thompson's author writing Will Ferrell's character into existence in 2006's ""Stranger Than Fiction"", or the underseen 1979 thriller ""Time After Time"" in which the character of H.G. Wells (author of the sci-fi classic ""The Time Machine"") uses profits from his writing to build a working time machine which one of his friends uses to escape the police and continue a killing spree when it is discovered that he's Jack the Ripper. ""Goosebumps"" deserves a place among these other great films.This film's story may not be completely original, but it feels fresh and it is fantastically well executed. All of the actors are perfectly cast (even Jack Black, who, in our opinion, seems to have had more misses than hits in his career). With the help of a story by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, a script by Darren Lemke and the direction of Rob Letterman, this cast and this story hit the perfect balance between frightening and fun – just like the ""Goosebumps"" books themselves. The script is very funny and the dialog and character interactions are charming from the very beginning to the very end of the movie. The interesting characters, the story's danger and adventure, along with the excitement and humor all seamlessly contribute to a simply wonderful family film that will appeal to kids of all ages, even if they don't know their goose bumps from their speed bumps or their Kings from their Stines.

62,Vivekmaru45,"As Julius Caesar In The 21st Century would say, ""I Downloaded It, I Saw It And I Deleted It.""",4,8 January 2016,"Or say Mr. William Shakespeare, ""Methinks This Film Stinks."" I agree with both of them. The film is an adaptation of R. L. Stines Goosebumps series of children's books. Goosebumps was made into a TV anthology series that ran for four seasons from 1995 to 1998.Goosebumps stars Jack Black as the author R. L. Stine, whose creations are literally brought to life when his storybooks are opened. So he keeps them locked and leads the life of a recluse, in the fear that someone else may try to open the books, thereby letting loose the monstrosities contained within.Plot: After moving into the town of Madison, Delaware, a teenage boy named Zach (Dylan Minnette) meets Hannah (Odeya Rush), his new neighbor. Hannah's father is R. L. Stine (Jack Black), who writes the Goosebumps stories and keeps all the ghosts, monsters, and villains in the series locked up in his manuscripts including Slappy the Living Dummy, the Abominable Snowman, Will Blake's werewolf form, the Giant Mantis, the living Garden gnomes, the graveyard ghouls, a Giant pink Blob and the Invisible boy named Brent Green. Zach and his friend Champ (Ryan Lee) unintentionally open one of Stine's books, leading to the release of every ghost, monster, and villain from the manuscripts. Now Zach, Hannah and Stine team up in order to put the ghosts and monsters back where they came from before they overrun the town and harm people.Verdict: If you've seen the films Jumanji(1995) and Zathura(2005) based on Chris Van Allsburg's books, then the special effects in the film will not impress you. Indeed I find that these two films are far too superior and that Allsburg is a better author than Stine.Jack Black's acting is monotonous, his jokes, facial expressions are becoming boring and monotonous. His best films were School of Rock (2003) and Nacho Libre (2006). His most comedic performance was in Nacho Libre, and I sincerely think that he will be remembered for this role.Dylan Christopher Minnette is another young actor that has done work in many productions like TV series Lost, Saving Grace, Awake and the comedy film Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. I do not consider him an extraordinary actor.Opposite him is Odeya Rush who starred in the science-fiction film The Giver (2014) directed by Phillip Noyce. Thank you for reading this review. Live long and prosper.More films: The Neverending story 1984, Return To Oz 1985, Joey a.k.a Making Contact (1985. Watch this highly underrated film. You will believe), Paperhouse (1988. Must see. Highly Recommended), Conan the Barbarian (1982), Time Bandits (1981), Dragonslayer(1981).",Goosebumps
63,swilliky,Goofy kids movie based on the book series I read as a kid,6,17 October 2015,"As a fan of the books as a child, there was much to look forward to in this amalgamation of R. L. Stine's horror series. The movie was marketed towards younger generation of kids but since it was about writing and this was my favorite series, I went to see it. Jack Black played R. L. Stine with a his usual charisma, and I thought his performance to be one of the most entertaining parts. He portrayed the horror writer with panache and was the source for most of the writer jokes. I liked how he was angered at the comparison to Stephen King claiming he had sold more copies of books. I guess even famous authors have doubts, but this was fiction. The cameo of the real R. L. Stine was quickly stuck in. The entire meta premise of the books crossing over into the real world was interesting and didn't really need an explanation that was never supplied. I was willing to go along with it and I assume most kids would too. The teenage cast members did a manageable job and nothing was too terrible to take away from the film. The romantic subplot between Odeya Rush as Hannah and Zach, played by Dylan Minnette, helped the story along and the comedic asides from Ryan Lee's Champ didn't fall flat. Zach's aunt, the always funny Jillian Bell, had a few good lines. The special effect were nothing amazing, made more for kids but they did make good use of the 3D in a few parts, especially the werewolf. Slappy the dummy was a great lead villain and should come back if they make a sequel.Overall this was a goofy kids movie that played on my nostalgia. I wish they had made more references to the novels instead of just throwing a bunch out there as an homage but I'm sure explaining all of the different books would have made for a longer movie. The pace already felt rushed. It was passable.",Goosebumps

65,bryank-04844,'Goosebumps' is fun for the whole family this Halloween! Recommended!,7,14 October 2015,"I'm surprised that Hollywood hasn't made a 'Goosebumps' film yet. I would have expected one or three at least a decade ago, given that all of the horror books by R.L. Stine have sold millions of copies and continue to do so. I guess the time is right more now than ever though as Halloween is approaching. I remember reading a variety of these stories back when I was very young and always remembered those iconic covers of each book. I wouldn't say that they books really did any permanent damage, scaring me, but they were quite fun and entertaining from what I remember.They were always good, short reads, and straight to the point, with a small amount of heart, soul, and life lessons in between the mild scares. These characters and books were part of most people's childhoods if you grew up in the 'X' or 'Y' generation. These generations now have kids of their own, and I'm quite happy to say that this film adaptation of 'Goosebumps' should satisfy both adults and children.Directed by Rob Letterman ('Cowboys and Aliens'), this film follows a teenage boy named Zach (Dylan Minnette), when he moves in with his mother next door to Hannah (Odeya Rush) and her mysterious father who happens to be R.L. Stine (Jack Black), the writer of all the 'Goosebumps' books. Stine is fairly kooky here in that fun Jack Black sort of way, and he wants almost zero contact from the outside world in fear that they will discover his writings, and for good reason. You see, if one of his original manuscripts is opened again, whatever monsters or creatures that are in those pages will come to life.Well it just so happens that Zach and his new fun, yet geeky friend Champ (Ryan Lee) accidentally open all of the books, and every R.L. Stine monster that is created gets out, including the Abominable Snowman, the lawn gnomes, the Giant Mantises, the Werewolf, and of course everyone's favorite dummy, Slappy, who is more or less the leader of these creatures. Make no mistake about it, these monsters are pure evil and are out to kill any human in sight, which makes for some surprisingly suspenseful moments. This aspect is something I loved about this movie.Sure, some of the characters and dialogue are very silly and full of youthful humor, but when it comes to the monsters, they really didn't dumb it down, but rather kept it lively, action-packed, and somewhat scary. It's a great mix of both comedy and mild horror that should be fun for the whole family, along with some decent life lessons. The visual and practical effects were both top notch for a kid's film, which was a delight to see as well, and the performances are all a bit over-the-top, but endearing. For what it is, 'Goosebumps' is a highly entertaining Halloween film, perfect for the whole family, and I'd expect a sequel soon.Recommended!",Goosebumps
66,AhmedSpielberg99,A Blast!,7,24 July 2018,"Without exaggeration, Goosebumps is one of the best comedy movies I've seen in a while. The humor works almost perfectly. Specially, as all the characters are so likable, even Champ who is this kind of dumb characters that are often turn out to be very annoying in many other movies like this. Honestly, sometimes Champ went too far, and some of his jokes fall flat, but that didn't make this character annoying, not in the slightest! I can't believe how many times I laughed out loud! Almost every single joke hits the mark. This movie also is as heartwarming as it is funny. Also, it has some very clever twists and turns that surprised me.Jack Black is so funny, even more funnier than he was in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, IMO.
Dylan Minnette is very good and adorable as always, but if you really want to see him acting, watch Don't Breathe or Netflix's series 13 Reasons Why. Odya Rush also is good, and Jillian Bell is hilarious as aunt Lorraine.Unfortunately, although I was engaged and very entrained in very second in this movie, I didn't really care, or rather worry about the characters. I didn't feel they were in danger. So this movie absolutely doesn't work as a thriller. As a PG-rated horror movie, this movie, of course, doesn't have to scare me. But the problem is that it becomes a bit tedious and lukewarm almost every time it tries to be scary. The visual effects could have been better, but it really don't have to be. Actually, I prefer to see the CGI in this quality, because it fits the campiness and the charming silliness of the movie, just like the original Jumanji. I can't believe how much I liked Goosebumps. I kept putting off watching it, and I thoroughly regret. I can't wait to watch the sequel!(7.5/10)",Goosebumps
67,Darkside-Reviewer,And they lived Slappily ever after...,6,14 May 2021,"Almost every person who grew up in the 1990s and early 2000s remembers Goosebumps weither you enjoyed the creepyness of the original books or you have fond memories of the enjoyably bad Goosebumps TV series. I personally remember checking the Goosebumps books out from the school library and reading them in bed at night when I was kid and from what I remember a few of them even gave me nightmares. In 2014 the Goosebumps franchise had reached nostalgic age which of course meant that it was the perfect time for movie producers to reboot the franchise and cash in on another nostalgic property.Goosebumps plot follows a teenage boy named Zach (Dylan Minnette) who moves to a new town with his mother. Zach quickly makes friends with the girl next door named Hannah (Odeya Rush) who lives with her overprotective father, who warns Zach to keep away from his daughter. Zach of course doesn't listen and along with his new best friend Champ (Ryan Lee) break into Hannahs house to try and help her after Zach overhears her screaming and shouting from his house. Zach and Champ accidentally open a locked book inside Hannah's house and find that a monster emerges from the book which quickly flees the house. Hannah's father reveals that he is infact R. L Stine (Jack Black) the famous writer of the Goosebumps books and that if his original Goosebumps manuscripts are opened a monster will be unleashed from it's page's. This begins a night of horror when all the Goosebumps monsters are released from their books under the command of the infamous ventriloquist dummy Slappy. Together the monsters wreak havok upon the small town and it's now up to Zach, Hannah, Champ and Stine to put the monsters back inside their books.Goosebumps (2015) is definitely a movie meant primarily for young children with a lot of silly humour and a cast of Goosebumps monsters that aren't particularly scary even for kids. Slappy is the leader of the all the other Goosebumps monsters in this movie with a large bulk of the monsters screen time being focused mainly on him as he gets up to mischief while making silly jokes so inoffensive and childish even a six year old would role their eyes at them.This isn't a bad Goosebumps movie by any means if anything it's actually pretty decent in terms of a modern day reboot of a beloved childrens series. The only downside is again it's primarily a kids film so there's not a whole lot for fans of the original books to enjoy but for a modern day childrens audience it's a perfectly harmless and entertaining movie.",Goosebumps
68,griffolyon12,A Fun Movie,8,19 October 2015,"With over 400 million books sold, R.L. Stine's Goosebumps books are among some of the most popular books of all-time. They are the kind of bump in the night campfire stories that keep any kid up late with images of ghouls and talking ventriloquist dummies flashing across their minds. After a successful TV series in the Nineties, Goosebumps now returns to an even bigger screen in the form of a large scale Hollywood movie starring Jack Black as a fictionalized version of Stine.Part comedy, part kid friendly horror, and even part Eighties Spielberg, Goosebumps is a great time at the movies this Halloween season. When Zach (Dylan Minnette) moves to small town Delaware with his single mom, things get weird fast. Just like a good Goosebumps story, it doesn't take long for Zach to find that something is off with their new next door neighbors. The Dad (Jack Black) is very over-protective of his daughter, Hannah (Odeya Rush), who Zach has a bit of a crush on. Of course, things get even more bizarre when it is revealed that Hannah's Dad is actually R.L. Stine, who actually imagined every monster he ever created into being, and had to trap them inside the pages of his Goosebumps manuscripts to keep them from wreaking havoc. Of course, all of the manuscripts get opened when Slappy, the talking ventriloquist dummy with a Napoleonic complex, gets loose from his book and seeks revenge on Stine for keeping him imprisoned all these long years.Goosebumps is the kind of fun, family entertainment that isn't made much anymore. It's a relatively PG-affair, with a key eye toward kids from about 10 up. The movie is funny, never raunchy, and actually tells a fairly sweet story about having to learn to let go of things in order to move on in life. Of course, there are some moments that might be a little scary for a kid, but the filmmakers do a great job of diffusing anything that might traumatize a child with laugh out loud humor. The script is chock full of wit, and when you couple that with the great cast of young actors and their impeccable chemistry and comedic timing, you get a movie that is fun instead of nightmarish, plus Jack Black is in prime scenery chewing form as Stine (just don't compare him to Stephen King). While the movie occasionally barrels through without ever giving our heroes much downtime to reveal more information about their characters, the final act of the movie works because of the likability of the cast and some clever twists that give the movie an added emotional punch.I give Goosebumps an 8 out of 10!",Goosebumps

Although I enjoyed the film, there wasn't anything that I considered out of the ordinary, not the story line, not the performances, not the humour, and not even the special effects.

70,CANpatbuck3664,Balances Family-Friendly Horror With Enough Surprises to be Fun,8,9 January 2017,"Even though I read my share of Goosebumps books as a kid, I still didn't run out to see Goosebumps. I don't remember the specific characters except the most famous ones (e.g. Slappy the dummy). The other reason is because even though I like Jack Black, his really good movies are few and far between. I checked this out on-demand and I'm honestly happy I did. This movie ended up being a lot better than I thought it would be. It knows how to celebrate the spirit of R.L. Stine's work, there's some surprisingly solid acting from the cast and they put some work into the relationships between the characters that would normally make my eyes roll.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* It's a beautiful day as Zach (Dylan Minnette) and his mom Gale (Amy Ryan) move into their new house in Madison, Delaware. They've decided to try and get a fresh start after a tragedy strikes their family and moving from New York City to a small town seems like just the ticket. Zach is less than thrilled about it and reluctantly carries in boxes from the truck. He's trying to wrap his head around the transition and his kooky Aunt Lorraine (Jillain Bell) when he unexpectedly makes contact with his neighbour Hannah (Odeya Rush). She seems to get him immediately but before their conversation gets too far, her dad Stine (Jack Black) yells at her to get back in the house.Movies geared towards families often lack the bite to appeal to adults. This isn't news and if you're looking for some dark horror here, my first question is why? Knowing the source material is the key (as is watching any of the material in the marketing). I think the movie hit the right counterbalance between soft-balling it in and pushing the envelope too far. There are some monsters here that would be pretty scary for the younger kids but as an adult, there's nothing frightening here. It's about right for the audience it's intended for, they wring some laughs out of what's supposed to be some of the scarier scenes. The monsters and villains from the Goosebumps novels are pictured on the screen in imaginative ways that are fun to watch, even when they're trying to stab, eat or maim our heroes.The concept of Stine's books coming to life might seem lame but it reminded me of classic movies that had a lot of imagination. They don't give the audience a concrete explanations on why is this is possible? How could this happen? (it made me think of BIG with Tom Hanks, he grew up all of a sudden because... magic?). But it grew on me as the movie went on. The creative team introduces the concept and then they largely play by their own rules. You never get a chance to ask too many questions because the movie does move along at a decent clip when stuff starts falling apart in Madison, Delaware.Another area this movie could have fumbled the ball is dealing with the characters. You've got a lot of your cliché plot-lines for a coming-of-age tale: the strained relationship between the parent and their kid, the teenage romance where the new kid in town falls in love with the shut-in etc. But this movie was refreshing in how they decided to deal with those well-worn stories. Instead of the typical ""you don't get me"" stuff, Gale and Zach still have a loving relationship, even though it has it's problems. They joke and deal with their difficulties together and I appreciated that. Another example is how the relationship between R.L. Stine and Slappy is explained. We grow to learn that Slappy is just a shadowy reflection of Stine (authors draw from what they know) and he represents Stine's inability to connect with people and how that's frustrated him even to this day. Not every subplot avoids pitfalls, Zach and Hannah's budding romance has been done over and over again in other movies. But the movie does a good job on not concentrating on it too long and they keep it moving by adding a few jokes or throwing a new twist in to avoid stagnation.I was also impressed by the cast in Goosebumps. You would think Jack Black would mug his way through this material but he's more nuanced and funny in this than the marketing lets on. He carries certain scenes in this movie easily and it's easy to forget how good he is if he's cast in the right role. Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush were decent as Zach and Hannah. The fact that they were teenage leads falling in love would normally be enough to lose my interest but they worked well together and apart. I thought Ryan Lee was funny but he was really over-doing it in certain bits. Jillian Bell was also solid in her small role, I'm liking her more and more. Amy Ryan also hit the right notes for her character to be effective.Lastly and maybe most importantly, the movie is pretty funny when it wants to be. The script seems to know when it's okay to wink at the audience. It doesn't hurt that you have guys like Jack Black delivering the dialogue but with all the rapid-fire jokes being fired at you, the hit-miss ratio was notably higher than I expected (minus some pretty awful puns by Slappy).Goosebumps could have been really awful. It could have been just an attempt to boost the sales of the books and the studio could have just done the bare-minimum to turn a profit. It wasn't though and I can see why it ended up being a minor hit. They put their own spin on some well-travelled concepts and they made a good decision to couple it with some quickly paced humour and some appropriate to the source material horror. Goosebumps turned out to be some decent entertainment after all.",Goosebumps

73,DareDevilKid,Fun For the Whole Family After Eons - 80s and 90s Style,9,5 December 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 stars""Goosebumps"" boasts just enough of its spooky source material's kid- friendly charm to go along with the script's facile humor, irresistible charm, and a mostly enjoyable but sometimes distractingly frenzied pace. It's thoroughly entertaining, a whole lot of fun, has oodles of charisma, and a premise that's a total hoot.Moreover, it features a great amalgamation of fantasy, adventure, and comedy that's entertaining and pleases everyone who watches it, regardless if you're familiar with the books or TV series or neither of the two. Rob Letterman's surprisingly sprightly direction deftly walks the tightrope between comedy and genuine scares – just the way Stine's ""Goosebumps"" novels used to do.Filled with captivating special effects, a host of memorable monsters, and even a gag alluding Stephen King, ""Goosebumps"" is an infectiously charming, out-and-out fun film for the whole family that will hopefully spawn a good franchise. It's also the first film I've seen that actually harks back to the more innocent times of the 80s and 90s by recreating the charm of something like ""Gremlins"" or ""Jumanji"", and successfully updates it rather than merely imitating it.",Goosebumps
74,khunkrumark,Featuring Dick van Dyke as the voice coach!,2,26 October 2015,"Two stars for the computer wizardry... unfortunately people are still seduced in to thinking that this gimmick can make a movie watchable. It can't.I would recommend that the film distributors think carefully before they release this noisy affront to intelligent men in England. If they do they'll be getting laughs for the wrong reasons.You have to go back as far as Mary Poppins to see a leading man do such damage to a film with his voice as Black does to this.On the bright side - it can become something of a fun family game to watch and see how many twisty turny things Black does with his voice.Luckily, if you play this game. you won't have the distraction of a discernible narrative to worry about. In this film there's no story whatsoever. Monsters escape and run about town causing CGI effects men to buy new cars and extend mortgages on their houses.If you think that Black is a funny guy (and mystifyingly there are plenty that do) or you are under six then you'll like this tripe.Parents... take your ipods!",Goosebumps
75,ArchonCinemaReviews,"True to Stine and fun for kids, parents should like it too",7,26 October 2015,"Anyone who was a kid or had a kid over the past twenty years knows what Goosebumps are, and R.L. Stine finally gets an upgrade from the small screen to a major motion picture by Sony Pictures, and we're satisfied.A teenage boy Zach and his mom move to Delaware, where Zach promptly runs into his next door neighbor Hannah and her odd father. When Zach thinks Hannah is in danger, he springs to be savior, but things aren't quite what they appear. Her dad is hiding a secret, and when Zach and his new friend Champ disregard the father's warnings, amazingly scary things come to life.Goosebumps the film is made for the kids, this isn't the type of film that is trying to bridge the age gap at being universally beloved. Lucky for the film, its makers know their market and the children in my theater loved it, and for this kid at heart, we liked it too.One of the smartest decisions the filmmakers made in making an R.L. Stine film adaptation of the beloved book series Goosebumps was casting Jack Black as the token 'adult' in the film. While we know Black has aged in real life, he is one of the few men in Hollywood who hasn't lost his wonder, and that transcends the big screen. He may put on a funny accent for the role of R.L. Stine but he has the right sentiment and that is obvious to audience members.The rest of the cast is equally wholesome and approachable, with each of the three teens (Dylan Minnette, Odeya Rush and Ryan Lee) being equally effective in their roles. The characters they portray aren't anything extraordinary or new, but they are archetypes we know and enjoy. The stand out among the three would be Odeya Rush and scenes where the kids are interacting with one another.Goosebumps does one thing that we wish would've been a bit bolder, and that is stray away from the horror and air more on the side of family adventure comedy. It's like Jumanji with zombies instead of a stampede of African wildlife. And that is also where it loses points for originality, as adult film goers will see the same plot line in a different skin, which is a tad disappointing for something as creative as the Goosebumps book series.There are scares, especially for those ages 12 and under, almost all 'jump scares' of the fun variety. And that is the type of tone Goosebumps is aiming for, fun and entertaining. Of course, being a fan of the series when I was a kid, I hoped for the creatures from the pages of the books to be a bit more eerie, but alas.Anyone who says this film is a complete disappointment must have lost their inner child ages ago. They are probably the type that says Santa Clause doesn't exist either or that monsters under the bed aren't real – and we all know those things are true. Goosebumps gets our seal of approval for popcorn, feet up, enjoyment.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Goosebumps

The characters were boring.4. Other than Jack Black, the actor didn't do it much better.5. Odeya Rush's acting was abysmal and she clearly just wanted a paycheck.6.

78,scottshak_111,A light popcorn entertainer!,6,1 November 2015,"Goosebumps fails to give you what its name promises. Or wait.maybe it didn't promise anything in the first place. More of a tribute to R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series. The movie is a very light comedy which banks on its sheer adventurous story to work. It does work though but not exactly the way you wanted it to.With a fantastical plot where characters pop out of books into the real world, it basically gives you the idea where things are headed. But when you don't slip in logic or even try to give a proper explanation things begin to go downhill. What is quite surprising about the movie is the fact that it manages to hold on, even when things don't. Both direction and editing of the movie has been done brilliantly. Helmed by Rob Letterman this flick has proper focus and runs at a great pace. There is slight comedy hurled hither and thither to make things jovial, which keeps the theme upbeat. Jack Black plays Stine, the renowned author. But here you see a different version of the Jack you used to know. He is a non-comical recluse holding a dire secret. Both Dylan and Odeya are delightful to watch and have been complemented well by the remaining crew. If you love dark, this isn't a movie for you. You might want things to go out of hand and to an extremity like in Cabin in the Woods. However, this movie makes everything seem pretty normal. Adrenaline doesn't pump much. Love looks mediocre. Loss doesn't bring tears. Proper thought hasn't been given in that department, I surmise. Almost reminds you of all those Disney flicks they make!Quite childish this movie, if you ask me. Kids are gonna love it though!",Goosebumps

This movie has everything you can ask of a movie, but unlike most movies - it isn't a cliché, it doesn't have useless political messages or unlikable actors, it doesn't have a single element that offends or panders - it's just perfect - sweet and charming, much like the actors and the storyline.Even the ""enemies"" were charming, and didn't feel like the obligatory cheap CGI, but were well top-of-the-line for this time.It's well worth watching this movie, as nothing lately comes even close as overall fantastically well produced as it is.",Goosebumps

The very BEST books are almost Four-Dimensional, because they're able to go BEYOND the Three-Dimensional into ""The Inner Mind."" GOOSEBUMPS has several things going for it (mostly Jack Black as R.L. Stine), but its three-dimensional limitations prevent it from ever rising above mere movie-making. (Of interest to Readers of Fright Fiction are the scenes where ""Stine"" seats himself at a desk that's part of a High School production of THE SHINING and proceeds to try to set aright that which has gone awry.) (I just finished King's DOCTOR SLEEP, his sequel to THE SHINING, which is a cross between THE DEAD ZONE and FIRESTARTER, with bits of NEAR DARK and LIFEFORCE thrown into the mix.) I was especially pleased by Stine's insistence on writing on a Manual Typewriter: computers are far more trouble than they're worth (I've had not one but TWO succumb to Viruses and I won't buy another one until somebody comes up with a TYPEWRITER Mode that allows you to put the thing to its PROPER use). GOOSEBUMPS taps into everything from THE PIED PIPER to John Carpenter's IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, from MAGIC to THE BLOB (among other things). I've never read an R.L.

Stine's Goosebumps books or not (I had over 30), it doesn't really matter, as this early 2016 release (Halloween release in other territories) caters to all. Director Rob Letterman and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (known for Man on the Moon and Big Eyes) create a story that boasts a bunch of monsters from Stine's well-loved children's horror stories. Creepy next door neighbour Stine's (Jack Black) daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush) makes friends with newcomer Zach (Dylan Minnette). Believing her to be hurt, Zach and new friend Champ (Ryan Lee) break into Stine's house. Being as inquisitive as youngsters can be, the boys release demons from the author's books, starting with the infamous Abominable Snowman of Pasadena. This isn't just a film for teenagers, there's plenty to for all of us to love, starting with a light yet well crafted script. The young trio, Minnette, Rush and Lee are talented stars, the latter wracking up the most laughs for being a giant scaredy-cat. Unlike the 90's T.V. series, Goosebumps is a funny, rollicking adventure, and not scary in the slightest. This is also one of Jack Black's best performances, significantly toned down, and all the better for it. Goosebumps has repeat viewing pleasure. Next time I watch it I will pause it on the monsters and see which ones I recognise.And last but not least, that ferris-wheel scene is breathtaking.",Goosebumps
84,kermitkid,Give yourself Goosebumps,8,30 March 2020,"Going in to this movie, I didn't really know what to expect. All I knew was that it had all the monsters and villains from the ""Goosebumps"" books, and frankly, I was worried that too many characters would give it a case of ""Spider-Man 3"" syndrome. Luckily, I was wrong. The plot is easy to follow, and most of the monsters are just background characters. Slappy is the main villain and the rest are just his minions. Jack Black did a great job as R. L. Stine and Slappy, and you can tell he's having a lot of fun with the roles. There was a character named Champ (Ryan Lee) and he should have been written out of the script. He's supposed to be the comic relief sidekick, but every line he says is just cringeworthy and painfully unfunny. He's just annoying! The movie would have been improved by a lot without him. Everyone else, however, was good. Not great, but good. The plot isn't that original. It's basically ""Jumanji"" with ""Goosebumps"" characters, but it's still a lot of fun. If you grew up reading the books or watching the t.v. show, then this is the film for you. If you're not familiar with the ""Goosebumps"" stories, you will be confused.

85,jmoneyjohal,"Fans of the Goosebump franchise will be left disappointed, this movie is more of a ""family entertainer"".",5,16 October 2015,"As a child I grew up on staple diet of R.L Stine books, and the YTV show Goosebumps. So when I entered the theater to watch the adaption of the numerous books I read as child, I entered sort of as a fan boy, I wanted to be taken back 10-15 years, and enjoy the film in the true Goosebump spirit. But unfortunately the film is not true to books or the TV show I grew up reading and watching.The film is rather made as a family entertainer, to cash in on the successful book franchise.I was left disappointed, but the Goosebump movie is a film the kids will lap, its good fun, and the Goosebump characters come alive on screen thanks to some good CGI. But the films story, and true essence is missing. But more on that later.Story wise the film is about Zach and his mom moving to a small town in Delaware, after his fathers death, to get a fresh start. Zach's mom is the new vice principal at his high school. Zach upon arrival at his new house is welcomed by his neighbors, a sweet girl named Hannah, but her very mysterious father condemns Zach from mingling with his daughter or entering his house. But much to the fathers dismay Zach becomes friends with Hannah, and when he gets too know her he finds out she is home schooled etc. One night Zach hears Hannah screaming at her father, he then scared for Hannah breaks into her home with his friend Champ, and accidentally opens books that had been locked. They where Goosebump books, and the character are now alive and terrorizing the streets. What happens next is what forms the rest of the plot.Acting wise Jack Black is the best of the lot he plays the creepy R.L Stine very well. The kids Dylan Minnette,Odeya Rush, and Ryan Lee are good.For a family audience, and for kids aged, between 6-14 I can assure you there is a lot too love in this adventurous, and fun Goosebump movie. Its funny, it has some good VFX and CGI, in short its a family entertainer. However for someone like me who is a fan of the old books, and the TV show, you will be left disappointed with the Goosebumps movie. The film doesn't have the creepy, scary aura at all the books had, instead you laugh at the character on screen. And with so many Goosebump characters too play with the story felt very amateur, and rushed. Seems like the producers just wanted to make big bucks off a popular franchise.Overall I am pretty sure R.L Stine like his fans of the Goosebump books will be left disappointed with this film, but for a family audience, and teenagers, I can see them loving the film because at the end of the day there is a lot of fun to be had if your of a certain age demographic.2.5/5* or 5/10",Goosebumps

It does have quite a few jump in your sit moments, but no real scare, as we're never allowed to forget that these are unreal monsters. But I don't mind - I never was partial for straight forward horror. I don't find gore and blood really entertaining. This film is entertaining. Loads of CGon the screen, that's what fantasy worlds look like in nowadays cinema. Only one weak moment in the entire film, that's when we get the required moment of personal growth for two of our leading characters. I don't want to go into details, as I don't do spoilers - you'll know when you see it - it simply came out as sappy and corny as they come. Loved the acting, got to say something about Odeya Rush, it's the first time I do see her on screen, she has what it takes to go a long way in this business, both the looks and the talent - a killer combo. Bottom line, it's a good fun ride, good jokes (most of the time) and non stop action. But be warned - the horror isn't really horrifying.",Goosebumps

I am a great admirer of R.L Stine for his children horror works and the movie adaptation was good as the shows. Jack black plays the role of Stine who had been hating the world for which he creates his own demons and ghouls so that he never feels lonely. The movie was nonetheless good but would have been more better according to me. The CG was not so astonishing and the child cast were just average on their part.

Stine, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski Directed By: Rob Letterman Review Viewer Beware your in for a scare. When I was like in fifth grade Cartoon Network put out the 90's kids show Goosebumps and I was watching an episode I think it was every night at seven. One's that usually come to mind where the first episode of goosebumps I ever watched which was The Haunted Mask, horrorland,monster blood, say cheese and die, and of course I have a thing for maniacal toy's like Chucky, so naturally I love Slappy and his Night of The Living Dummy Trilogy. The film starts off with this teenager named Zach who moves into the town of Madison Square Gardens with his mom and the two of them now live close to his aunt. He befriends his neighbors daughter Hannah, he hears her screaming one night and decides to check it out. Her father is not much of a people person. and cut off the world and was always alone. Zach goes to the house and releases one of the many goosebumps monsters which knocks down all of the other books and when another book falls it unlocks and unleashes R.L Stines most devious creation who is a lot like him, Slappy. When R.L Stine and the kids come home after putting The Abominable Snow Man of Pasadena back in the book, Slappy is who they encounter and he takes all the books and unleashes every monster to get his revenge on R.L Stine and destroy the town. Now R.L Stine and the kids have to get him to the school to get his special typewriter and write a story with every monster he's ever created to suck them back into the book. You know in an interview with the Slappy Dummy at the premier he said their was a love story in their and I was actually not looking forward to that part especially since it wasn't in any of the trailers and I was afraid on how they would handle it. But they actually did a very good job with it, if i'm not mistake it's like the movie ghost but I wouldn't know because I haven't seen Ghost. The Kids do have chemistry they play well off each other. I was in the theater watching this with kids to my left and they were engaged and having throughout the movie. At times they were even frightened as well because of the clown that was unleashed. I put out a discussion on this movie saying that it had the potential to be one of the best horror films ever because one site does have listed int he horror genre so it technically is a horror film, its one for kids and adults with almost every type of monster which is why I believe it is one of the best and I think it's one of the best horror films ever. Goosebumps, has enough frightful fun energy with almost every type of monster you could think of and really does have a heart behind it within it's romantic chemistry between the leads and a heart goes out to the fans of the books or show. I'm giving Goosebumps a five out of five, it really is my favorite horror film and i'm sorry if you disagree.",Goosebumps
90,stephendaxter,Fun for kids. Fun for fans. Not so much for everyone else.,7,13 January 2016,"'Goosebumps' is a Family Adventure/Comedy based on the popular series of books from the 90's written by R.L Stine. In the film, all of the iconic Goosebumps monsters escape from their books and unleash their terror on the world. Now Zach (Dylan Minnette), the new kid in town must team up with R.L Stein (Jack Black) himself and his daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush) to put the evil back where it belongs. I loved the Goosebumps books, they were so scary and entertaining and when i had nothing to read, i'd just crack open 'Night of the Living Dummy' or 'Scarecrow Walks at Midnight' and treat myself to a good scare. This film brings these monsters to life and although they don't get as dark as they do in the books, the way the film manages to balance being kid friendly and quite spooky was really cool. I found this film overall quite entertaining, the characters were mostly very likable, the plot of the film was actually quite interesting and there were some mildly funny moments here and there. But there were some things that weren't that great.Lets get the bad out of the way. The film i thought went for a generic cop-out when it came to the first 20 minutes of this film, the setup. I felt like i had seen the exact same scenario played out over and over again in hundreds of films, it was like they took this section from every other film and plopped it in front of a Goosebumps movie. Move to a new house, new school, meet the girl and then begins the movie.... i know it's keeping it simple for the kiddies but they could at least look like they tried. My biggest gripe with the film however was one of the secondary characters, Champ, played by Ryan Scott Lee... my god this character was infuriating, he was a complete waste of space, and way too much time was spent on his completely unfunny scenes. He was seriously 100% useless in the entire film, i don't know why he was even there, he wasn't funny, wasn't needed and just made me angry every time he opened his mouth. Right from the moment you first see him you know you're going to hate this kid, and you do. The film would have been SO much better without him, he just sucked the enjoyment out of the film the whole time. One other thing i was disappointed with but was rather unavoidable was the fact that you don't really get to fully experience more than like 3-5 of Stine's monsters. You get a lot of cameo appearances from the monsters but only 3-5 are featured for a large chunk of the film. I guess when you have hundreds of monsters it is hard to fit them all in one movie so you can't hold it against the film too much. But hey, seeing Slappy the Dummy on the big screen was great, and he is just as scary as in the books, so i guess that was worth it. The overall plot of the film was really entertaining and managed to keep me interested the whole way through. When i first heard about the synopsis of the film i thought it was a genius idea, and i just hoped that it didn't turn out to suck. But it really worked, it had its fair share of surprises and 'twists' and was hands down a very fun movie to watch. Even the main characters i really liked and i thought the performances were all very well done, from the main 3 characters that is. It isn't often where i get to say i really liked Jack Black's performance but in this film i really liked his version of R.L Stine. It was fun, quirky and fit with the tone of the film so that was really well done. There isn't really much else to say about this film as you should know what you're getting into by now. So despite some major and some relatively minor grievances the film holds up quite well and is an entertaining family film that appeals more to kids and fans of the books than it does to adults.6.9/10",Goosebumps

I was skeptical heading into this, but I was surprised at how much I ended up liking it. While not groundbreaking by any means, it is still a nice tribute to the work of R.L. Stine.I actually really enjoyed Jack Black as R.L. Stine. He is definitely not the first actor I would have thought of to play this role, but he gave a nice take on a fictionalized version of the world-famous author.The story is filled with a lot of fairly standard ""coming-of-age"" teenage film tropes. The main teenage characters are hardly anything we haven't seen before, but they are pretty likeable, so it could have been worse. Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush actually had pretty decent chemistry.I really like the concept of R.L. Stine's stories coming into the real world after being released from their books, and the monsters in this film were pretty darn cool. We get to see Slappy the Dummy, the lawn gnomes, a giant preying mantis, the abominable snowman, the warewolf of Fever Swamp, and many more. The fanservice in this movie is really well done. The only complaint as far as the monsters go is that the CGI used for the warewolf and the abominable snowman was pretty bad.The film moved at a really fast pace, and I really liked the resolution and how everything was wrapped up. You also got to love the cameo by the real R.L. Stine.This film is solid entertainment for the whole family.

How about not getting punched at all? This isn't a very good film. It's fine, has its fleeting moments.

94,AnishMisra,Goosebumps review,7,4 February 2018,"Goosebumps is a film directed by Rob Letterman. back in 2015, when I watched the film I liked it. It made me remember the Goosebumps series that I had watched back in the 90's. So I decided to watch it again in order to write it a review. I again felt the same.Plot: RL Stine teams up with a group of tenagers to stop his monsters from creating havoc in the town of Madison.Story and direction: I haven't read the Gossebumps books, but still I can say that this was an enjoyable film. The comedy was spot on. I chucked on most of the jokes that were cracked. Also most of the characters were quite likable> we get to see the kinds of similarities that both Rl Stine and Zach face. LAos dealt with quite greatly is the mother-son dynamic between Zach and his mother. I hope that aspect would have been explored more. The creatures wre quite entertaining in their own way. But sometimes while watching I felt that there was a big VFX creature being watched. The VFX was very superficial in some places that irritated me a lot. Also I felt that I didn't have so many memorable moments in the film that would make the film last long in my mind. Performances: Jack Black once again stole the show for me. He nailed it as R L Stine. HIs voice work as Slappy and the Invisible Boy were on point. Dylan Minette was great too. Same can be said for Odeya Rush and Ryan Lee. Why was Jillian Bell taken also is not yet understood by me. Both the actors who portrayed police officers were also OK. I hoped that Amy Ryan get more screen time. It was good to see RL Stine (the original Goosebumps author) get a screen time.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene depicting the small conversation between Zach and R L Stine to depict how similar they are. That scene touched me a bit.Verdict: Goosebumps is a very enjoyable film. Don't keep any expectations while watching the film.

I actually left Australia to fly over to New Zealand to see this movie. Reason being, is because it does not get a release date here in Australia until January the 14th, and being a top fan of Goosebumps growing up, I was not going to wait. Nicholas (the other Autistic Reviewer) will review this when it comes out in Australia. Now for my review: You have pretty much everything you can ask for in this movie: action, adventure, fantasy, comedy and...surprisingly a great romance movie! Jack Black was great as R.L. Stine. Would have been nice to have a mole on his head like the real R.L. Stone, though! Almost everybody claims Jack Black ruined this movie, but to be honest, it's actually his best film since ""School Of Rock."" All the other actors were great as well. It was like watching the TV show growing up...the actors all made it cheesy, and yet, likable. I hope to see more of Odeya Rush. She was excellent.A lot of people also say the effects were horrible. Come on, people!!! I have seen way worse. I admit, they were from Oscar worthy, but they were far from bad. To be even more honest, I thought some of the effects looked better than Jurassic World. All the monsters from the Goosebumps books are in it. Problem is it depends on who you like more and less and how much screen time they all get. The main villain is Slappy (who was voiced by Jack Black. I didn't even know it was him either. He did a great job on making Slappy creepy and funny at the same time), and Slappy gets a lot of screen time. Some other monsters they also get screen time are the Lawn Gnomes, The Werewolf Of Fever Swamp, The Abominable Snowman and The Giant Praying Mantis. There are many more. But these monsters are the main ones. I thought they did a great job at fitting them all in.All in all, it stays true to the books, keeps the cheesiness of the TV show, and has nonstop action all the way through. It does take around 30 mins for the action to start, but once it happens, it happens nonstop all the way through! I loved it, and it was worth traveling to see it! Highly recommended for newcomers and old comers! 10/10 (5/5 stars)If you grew up in the 90's, you are probably most likely to remember the best of times in toys, books, films and various pop culture trends and styles but this generation has decided to bring back a popular book from back in the day known as 'Goosebumps' it was a set of horror stories written by the great R.L. Stine that were all based for young children and early teens and was even adapted for a TV series that gained a cult following among 90's kids. This first attempt to bring it to the big screen packs plenty of spooky fun, humour and really entertaining material that will impress the original and new fans of the franchiseA new kid on the block, teenager Zachary ""Zach"" Cooper and his mother move to the small town of Madison, Delaware from New York as his mother gains a new work role as vice-principal of the local high school that Zach will be attending and starting fresh after the loss of his father from the previous year. Zach meets his new neighbour Hannah who appears to be fun and really interested in him until her father tells Zach to stay away from them and makes Zach wonder on why he is so mysterious and unfriendly. After hearing a possible struggle from inside their home, Zach and his new geeky friend Champ investigate the household to further prove his claim but stumble across a bookshelf containing books with locks and scary sounding tiles that makes the boys realise that the mysterious figure is in fact R.L. Stine, but it's not long until one book is unlocked and kicks off an adventure of bravery and spooky fun that Goosebumps is known for. What makes the film great is the casting of Jack Black, visual effects and the spooky vibe and tones that isn't full on but done in a comedic tone that's cheesy (due to some of the characters featured) and the villains that are worthy. Leading the cast is Jack Black, who gives not only his usual best but gives a sharp and spot on role as the mysterious R.L. Stine that he seems to make more likable when it's revealed. This is a great performance but it doesn't top over his role as Po from the Kung Fu Panda films (in which a third instalment is due for release later this year). The scary and villainous characters including its main one (which I won't say who it is as I want to keep you surprised) are all likable and are really done well, they help to make the film keep the fun and scary tones rolling smoothly after the 20 minute mark into the film, keep an eye out on some cameos from some of the best books in the series. Overall, Goosebumps is a nostalgic call back for the fans and this film adaptation keeps it in high spirits of its original books while it does carry some cheesy moments from some of the characters but it does redeem itself though its tones, plot and the leading performance of Jack Black.4/5 - Nick",Goosebumps
96,Sci-FiHorrorFan,A Fun Movie that Brings back memories.,8,23 December 2015,"I Really enjoyed this film I found it very Entertaining and I liked all of the characters. I thought the film was fun and very funny. I thought Jack Black was very Funny and he played his part very well.I thought It was pretty funny to see Jack Black as R.l Stine. I think part of the reason I enjoyed this film so much is because I watched a lot of goosebumps episodes when I was younger and seeing the Film reminded me how much I liked the kids show. I also read a lot of the books and This film showcases most of the monsters that were in the show and the books. You have the werewolf of fever swamp, you get to see the abominable snowman, you get to see the invisible boy and the Garden Gnombs and even Slappy! As well as many more. I started laughing my ass off when I saw Slappy because he was funny and it was cool seeing him again.There is also an Apereance from the blob and a swarm of big bees, and Giant insects. I thought the special effects of the monsters were alright.some of the effects were a Little Dodgy and I've seen better effects but most of them were alright.The Fight scenes with every monster were good and I enjoyed all those scenes.I also liked how all the main characters worked together to fight the monsters.I just thought the film was a lot of fun and its quite fast paced too, it was always moving and I never got bored. I thought the story and directing were good and most of the humour was good too. The Film has a certain Innocent charm to it because the Film never takes itself too seriously. the Film always seemed to be Entertaining and interesting things always seemed to be happening so the Film held my attention the whole time. I thought the acting from the younger cast was Okay but Jack Black was the true stand out of the film and I personally found him the funniest. The teenagers made me laugh a few times, and I actually thought they were likable. I found the idea to the Film quite original and I like the idea about the monsters coming out of the books and becoming real,that's a pretty cool idea in my opinion. All of the monsters were originally locked inside the books but the Lead guy opens a book and accidentally unleashed one of them.Later Slappy opens all of the books, and all of the monsters end up getting unleashed and then they terrorise the whole town and Slappy is their Leader, and its up to R.l Stine and the kids to save the town and get the monsters back into the books. This film definitely shouldn't be taken too seriously because it's more of a kids horror film mixed with fantasy and Comedy. I Really enjoyed the Ending to the Film I thought it was Action Packed fun and Thrilling.The film also has a Heart and there were some nice emotional scenes that I liked. Overall I Liked the Film a Lot and I recommend it, it's a Fun Popcorn Flick.",Goosebumps
97,djangozelf-12351,"Dumb,dumber,dummy.",2,4 December 2015,"If this scares you your probably between the age of 6 to 10.This is pitifully predictable and nobody does anything that is out of character so all the lines become very bland.Acting,script and CGI all don't work and the design of the creatures felt far from the source material they were stolen from. Worst example being the werewolf that barks like a dog. But also the zombies were a joke and it all looks more goofy than actually scary.It all feels like build up horror and while your expecting a reward,the reward is never delivered.Even more so near the end they pull to many monsters out of the hat that get absolutely little to none screen time and get duplicated to make sure the whole screen is filled.But it is really useless overkill.Overall I did not like it,a little bit to silly for me.It does have some potential,so maybe, with a different approach? But seeing the raving reviews people liked it this way, so better to be honest and say this is just something that's not for me.This really made me think that it felt more like a theme park ride made into a movie.Ending positive...the first scene with the gnomes made me laugh.Therefor not 1 but.....",Goosebumps

The plot is about the R.L stine creations in his book get released and cause havoc in a small town with some great family friendly creatures. The CGI is not the best but with a well thought out cast you can forgive. Jack black plays the author RL stine and quite possibly his best film since school of rock. When i say a family adventure tho what i mean is make sure your child is older than 8 years old as any younger some of the creatures may frighten them. With some light hearted comedy plenty of action and a run time of just over 90 minutes goosebumps is one to enjoy and bring back plenty of memories.",Goosebumps

100,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 87,9,23 October 2015,"I've never really been quiet when it comes to the lack of live-action family films these days. Growing up in the '90s there were a plethora of them. Over the past decade or so there has been a steep decline in this sub genre with studios opting to make animated films instead. It's somewhat understandable since they're more reliable when it comes to making a profit, as seen by the success that Pixar and Dreamworks have had. But there's just something to be said about watching actual people on screen deal with their problems. Especially as children, it kindles our imaginations because if we see it happening to them, it could happen to us too, right? And when done correctly they can really be memorable.While this film is only partially animated, it takes place in the real world with live-action humans. In Goosebumps, the motion picture based on R.L. Stine's enormously successful children's book series of the same name, Zach (Dylan Minnette) and his mother move to the suburban town of Madison, Delaware. Zach gripes a lot about there being nothing to do in his new city until the mysterious homeschooled neighbor girl (Odeya Rush) befriends him and he develops an interest in her. One night he's led to believe that she may be imprisoned by her own father, a fictionalized version of R.L. Stine himself (Jack Black), and sneaks into her house. He discovers a bookshelf full of Goosebumps manuscripts which he decides to explore. Opening the first story releases a 10-foot tall abominable snowman who starts wreaking havoc throughout the town. Eventually, one by one, each story gets opened up with the books' respective monsters coming to life trying to kill their creator, Stine.Some may consider it a bad thing, but this movie does a great job of not holding back any scares. Adults shouldn't have too hard of a time--although certain monsters may tap into your own personal phobias--but it will definitely haunt many children. But that's what makes Goosebumps so appealing. It keeps the visuals acceptable, but never tones itself down. When I was little we had the anthology television show Are You Afraid of the Dark? which still creeps me out as an adult. Goosebumps is frightening, but it's a harmless scare. It provides us with the same macabre tone of the novels--probably much to the dismay of some of the parents.It gets most of the character background out of the way early on in the first third of the film, which gives itself room to run free for the last hour or so. However, it lets most of that information sit idle for the rest of the film--some of which never really gets revisited.The movie hits its stride about 20 minutes in when we start witnessing Stine's creepiness first hand and the books start coming to life. We are dying to know why it's happening and how to stop it, and that information may be given away a bit too easily. But not to worry because, in true R.L. Stine fashion, we still get our fill of twists throughout.What this film does really well, albeit stylistically inconsistent at times, is make us laugh. The humor works well on both adult and kid levels. It's really a funny movie and it does so without becoming too irreverent. We still feel like something's at stake, but the jokes help to lighten to the tone on the scarier elements of the film. I think one reason why live-action family films have failed in recent years is because filmmakers have lost touch with what makes kids laugh. They know kids want to see something really outrageous that they would only be able to see in animation, but I think this film may be on to something by aiming the jokes back up to the grownups and not dumbing them down. It doesn't fall back on cheap slapstick or fart jokes to get laughs--it's gets them with some pretty solid comedic timing and by finding cleaner versions of the humor that's popular in recent R-rated comedies.Goosebumps may not be a Best Picture nominee, but it's extremely enjoyable and acts as a great tribute to R.L. Stine's famed franchise. It elicits our imagination and does so through the medium of literature. And there is also a nod to Steve McQueen's The Blob, which is one of my favorites.Although I would have liked to have seen just a handful of stories explored in depth rather than all the stories being briefly touched upon with highlights on maybe 3 or 4, I'm sure the future sequels will do a better job focusing in on one or two stories. Despite the slightly rocky pacing and the minor, yet sloppy, plot holes, Goosebumps will please fans of the book series and will bring adults back to the days when their imaginations weren't so jaded. Hopefully the success of this film will help set the trend for a return of live-action family films.Twizard Rating: 87 **Review can also be found at TheTwizard.com**",Goosebumps
101,tiskec,Goose-Droppings,3,14 November 2016,"My review probably differs from the majority, that I am pretty sure of. So, to flat out come out with it, this movie sucked a*s. I hated it. I used to read Goosebumps as a youngster. It had all the original characters from R.L. Stines books (Slappy, Abominable Snowman of Pasadena, etc.). Although, I just wasn't feeling it. I thought the TV series Goosebumps was WAY better than this. Trying to cram children's book characters into one film's story-line just didn't work, at least not for this one in my aspect. This particular Goosebumps tells the story of a boy that moved to a new town, next to the author R.L. Stine, who apparently is trying to keep his name under wraps. He seems to be harboring all of his story book monsters in separate books he has stored in his home. He's a completely ugly hermit do to this. He has a daughter who starts getting a twinkle for the next door neighbor boy, and they sneak off together. Well, one day the boy thinks R.L. Stine is abusing his daughter, so he runs over to the next door house and sneaks in. Eventually he finds these books, knocks them off the shelf, they open, and lone and behold the Goosebumps gang of monsters begins to spill out. Well, I think they crammed way too much stuff into it, and I think all of the character's roles were rushed. I just didn't feel the Goosebumps originality from this film. It might be because I'm trying to compare it too much with the knowledge I have of Goosebumps from when I was a child. Anyway, this movie isn't so terrible. I may have been a little harsh on the rating, but that's where I stand with this one. Mainstream will think differently.",Goosebumps
102,tmpsvita,a good surprise,7,10 July 2016,"I finally managed to see this film , I expect it to be too long because it came almost three months after the US release . Finally we find Jack Black after so many years of absence as the protagonist , here back in top form with his great acting and expressive comedy that has always distinguished it in show business . In general the film runs very well managing to entertain not only children but also adults . Beautiful soundtrack and directed that surprises with camera movements and brilliant shots . The special effects are also really amazing and very help the film . The only flaw is the photograph nothing short flat and almost anonymous as a low-quality television films . .",Goosebumps
103,mwcrunner,Better then the 90's TV series,9,23 May 2016,"At first some people thought that this film was gonna be a box office bomb, but it turns out that this movie is a masterpiece. Jack Black really saved this movie. Also all the monsters in this movie are better looking then they are in the old television series. Now I do remember watching the series as a kid and the one Goosebumps story I was really scared of was the Haunted Mask. The best character of this movie is Slappy the Dummy and he's better looking as is on the cover of the first book he appeared in and better looking then he did in the television series. Not only does Jack Black do Slappy's voice he also voices the Invisible Boy. This also has a pretty good love story in it about those teenagers and the teenage girl turned out to be one of R.L. Stine's creations and she went back into the book at the near end with all the other monsters, but comes back when it's almost the end. We also see a cameo appearance of the real R.L. Stine in the movie. Jack Black did really good at playing R.L. Stine too. Jack Black is truly a great singer and actor. We also get a lot of good laughs through out this movie including the one at the end when R.L. Stine played by Jack Black is frightened by the Invisible Boy. Definitely better then the television series cause of its laughs and it's special effects which are better then the effects in the TV series.",Goosebumps
104,byson5186,Great Movie,10,14 March 2016,"One book and T.V. show everybody who was a kid in the '90s is familiar with is Goosebumps, along with the author R.L. Stine. Goosebumps came on Fox Kids in 1995. The year before, the popular kids show was Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. I loved that show, but stopped watching after the second season when it stopped entertaining me. It seemed to go downhill during the second half of the 2nd Season. I noticed even as a kid, how it was predictable and repetitive. So, Goosebumps seemed like the new popular kids show at the time. I didn't watch Goosebumps too often as a kid. Some of the episodes are really cheesy and others, not entertaining. I've watched more episodes as an adult. There'd later be other R.L. Stine T.V. Shows not as remembered like The Nightmare Room, and Haunting Hour. There are also a couple of R.L. Stine movies, like When Good Ghouls Go Bad. I've seen that movie, and it is mostly cheesy, though some scenes from that movie reminded me of scenes from this movie. There's also, Haunting Hour, Don't Think About It. A movie with Emily Osment. That movie is a great entertaining Halloween movie, I'd say better than other Halloween movies including Hocus Pocus. While watching that movie, I could really relate to the character Sean, and it seriously helped me. I wrote a review on that movie, you can look at if you're curious.Now, while this review has been talking about R.L. Stine's earlier works, I will talk about the movie. We can ask about why this movie was good from my opinion? Well, not hearing a lot about this movie, and knowing how some of R.L. Stine's work isn't entertaining, I didn't expect too much before watching this movie. But, as soon as I turned it on, I noticed how entertaining the whole movie was. It's not a movie I'd want to just get up and use the bathroom during, not caring to miss a part, or feeling like the movie was boring. The whole movie entertained me, and I had my eyes glued to the screen.Dylan Minette played his role really well in this movie, quite a solid performance. He was in a couple of episodes of Haunting Hour. There was also Ryan Lee, who was in an episode of Haunting Hour, and a main character in this movie. He played a funny and interesting character. We have a more well-known actor, Jack Black in this movie. I haven't seen him in awhile. He played his part really well, and added comedy.Now, about the story. Again, I can mention how some episodes of Goosebumps aren't memorable or too entertaining. This movie had a very entertaining storyline. It had some good humor in it, and Minette's character, Zach seemed like a more memorable character than the characters we'd see in a Goosebumps episode, again solid performance. There was also a bit of a love story in the movie, and from all the R.L. Stine work I've seen, this movie seemed to have the biggest love story. It also gave a bit of a high school feel, and had a good plot. If you've seen the trailer, you'll know how this movie includes all the monsters from the Goosebumps books, rather than just coming up with a new one, and then having the writer of the books R.L. Stine as a main character. The special effects from this movie were pretty good too.In all, it was a pretty happy and entertaining movie. I'd give it a 10/10. Though, with all the references to the original books, I think it would have been cool if they had done things like play music from the original series, or show the opening and closing to give the real Goosebumps feel we got from that show. Too bad, but it was still an entertaining movie and a must see to anybody who likes R.L. Stine's work.",Goosebumps

107,afsalthodupuzha,""" A Decent Cinematic Version Of The Best-Selling Series By R.L.Stine """,7,2 November 2015,"Goosebumps was one easily accessible fiction for most children growing up in the 90's that had a huge fan following then and even now.In my case,there was a plethora of the series in my School Library and hence naturally this one become a regular read and forthwith a childhood favorite that gave goosebumps every time I read it because of its spooky horror element mixed with twists and genuine humor.Directed by Rob Letterman who gave a lame rework of Gullivers Travels back in 2010 ,the cinematic version of the popular novel do hold the spookiness that the books offer,but only upto an extent.The screenplay by Darren Lemke based upon an original story by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski mixes up creatures like Slappy The Dummy, Zombies,Werewolf,Giant Mantis and Abominable Snowman from the goosebumps series which all gets to be a part of less than two hours long narrative.The factor of nostalgia plays a significant role here as the screenplay is strictly average and the major factor of appeal is the connect that the viewers develop with the characters whom they have met before in books.Having said this,I must also admit the fact that the movie offers something for even the new audience who have never been to the series in the form of interesting humor and twists.On the negative side,the horror part was really weak and there wasn't a single moment that could chill the spines in the narration.Further,the mixing up of too many characters into one story couldn't make any wonders as expected and ended as a pretty average effort by the makers to spin out a movie based on the series.According to author RL Stine,every Goopsebumps story can be broken down into three parts and the same applies to this one too,the twist element here being really impressive and executed well.Jack Black as R.L Stine couldn't get better and the actor was pretty impressive with his peculiar dialog delivery and mannerisms.Dylan Minnette and Odeya Rush were equally good and played their part well.Ryan Lee enacted the clichéd character of a cowardly friend to the hero.The CGI part was slightly on the disappointing side considering this as a Hollywood movie,but made up by neat editing and cinematography.Overall,Goosebumps is a retro-fashioned horror comedy that can be watched with families this Halloween.",Goosebumps

110,drawlife,"It's a nostalgia bomb, destined to be a Halloween classic.",8,16 October 2015,"I'm a 90's kid, and growing up, Goosebumps played a big part of my childhood, both the books and the television series. It's what got me reading in the first place. I can safely assume that most young adults in their early to mid twenties today knew about R.L. Stine's popular series, and if you didn't read them, you at least knew what they were, or you were mesmerized by Tim Jacobus's awesome Goosebumps book cover art. Now I'll be honest, I did not like the trailers. They felt very generic and annoying, but some part of me knew that despite the mediocre trailers, it was going to be, at the very least a moderately decent film at best. Once the reviews started kicking in and seeing how positive they were, my expectations grew, and after seeing it I'm happy to report that this film is very fun. The idea of a Goosebumps film always intrigued me. I liked the filmmakers out of the box and almost meta approach. They didn't adapt one Goosebumps book, they used up all of them which was smart on their part. Adapting just one Goosebumps book, there really isn't much of a movie there, just an episode like the television series in the 90's. Using all the monsters creates more story-telling possibilities and the self-awareness that was at play worked. The main cast is pretty close to stellar. You would think that there wouldn't be too much layers within a film like this, but surprisingly there are some tender moments. Jack Black is superb. He plays R.L. Stine a little more on edge and a little more sinister. You can tell he was having fun in the role and cause of it you can fun as well. Stine's characterization is also surprisingly well done, there isn't a whole lot, but it's enough to keep you intrigued. You discover he created these monsters out of loneliness and it provides some sympathy for him which is a nice touch. Dylan Minnette, Odeya Rush, and Ryan Lee make up an entertaining trio of young leads. Minnette as Zach plays it a little straight, but he carries the film very well, Rush is good as the romantic and mysterious girl Hannah, she and Minnette play off each other well, there are some uneven moments within the dialog involving some romantic scenes but for the most part is almost works. Ryan Lee provides the comic relief like he did in J.J. Abram's Super 8. Jillian Bell and Amy Ryan aren't given too much to do as Zach's aunt and mom, but they are involved within the story so it was nice to see that. I didn't really care for the two officers in the film, they came off as forced comedy. As for the monsters, they rule. Obviously some have more to do than the others, but they are very cool to look at. At times you kinda wish that there were more monster moments. The Werewolf of Fever Swamp sequence at the market was quite entertaining, The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena is causing mayhem, Dr. Brewer's plant monsters from Stay Out of the Basement were cool, the lawn gnomes were freaky, there's a mummy, a giant Praying Mantis, an evil clown, and zombies that are all in the mix. But the real star is Slappy. He is R.L. Stine's darker personality embodied as a ventriloquist dummy, who is also voiced by Black, and is one heck of a villain. I would argue he steals the show. I loved that I got a sense of danger in the film, these monsters were actually trying to kill people in the film, so some stakes are involved and you come to care enough about the characters. Now despite them looking real cool, I thought all the cgi monsters like the Werewolf, the Yeti, or even the blob looked unpolished in a lot of the scenes. You can clearly tell it was a computer generated creature. A little more polishing wouldn't have hurt the overall look. Also, just a minor nitpick, I really hoped I would get to see The Haunted Mask, but I didn't, perhaps Carly Beth was in the shot where all the monsters assembled and I just missed it. Again, there were some forced humor involving the two police officers in the film that just didn't work, and some corny written dialog and corny delivery of lines here and there, particularly the romantic scenes. The pacing of this film is brisk, it moves very fast and there isn't a dull moment. I would imagine that should this film be successful and I hope it is, that it would be a little difficult to make another one because all the monsters were used in one film, but hopefully they'll come up with something cool. This film is simply a nostalgia bomb. Combining elements from other films such as The Monster Squad, Gremlins, Goonies, and Jumanji. It's not scary if you're a grown ass young adult like I am, but the entire time you appreciate the scares cause it would frighten you if you were a lot younger. Lots of children were creeped out in the theater, and kudos to Rob Letterman and his crew for not compromising the scary elements. They really push the boundaries for a family/kid-friendly horror film. Goosebumps is destined to be a Halloween classic. 8.3/10",Goosebumps
111,theemuhammede,The dmons are brought to life,9,4 May 2016,"Goosebumps has been brought to life! This movie was absolutely awesome and ideal for anyone who has read any of the Goosebumps books.This movie was not what I had anticipated it to be. I figured that it was going to be revolved around one particular book from the series. But come to find out, I was wrong. It was a collaboration of all of the famous Goosebumps stories to tell a new story of its own.The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, and it took too much time with the character development. But once the first demon of Goosebumps appeared, it was a non-stop scary humorous adventure. The best demon was the ventriloquist Slappy the Dummy. He was a hilarious villain who simply wants to take over the world. The werewolf and the abominable snowman were runner up to Slappy the Dummy in performance.For those who have read Goosebumps as a child, no matter how long ago it was, this movie will surely be a trigger of those feelings one would get when reading the books. It really brings the imagination to life.",Goosebumps
112,benjaminwest-242,A decent film,5,25 October 2021,"Goosebumps is a solid film...for kids. Of course, this is technically the target audience. The acting is actually decent, highlighted by Black and a good supporting cast, although falling into the typical, over-done high school stereotypes. The plot starts strong, with an intriguing premise and villain. However, the storyline gradually starts falling short, to the point where it feels rushed and oversimplified. Some lacking dialogue and character development contribute to this. Fortunately, the sometimes smart comedic choices and respectable emotional depth assists the film enough to be tolerable. Overall, barely worth watching for those reminiscing reading the books.",Goosebumps
113,ddelhuerto,"Finally!! Thank you, Sony Pictures Animation!!",9,1 November 2015,"I never thought there would actually be a Goosebumps movie, until I found out that it's finally coming out. The only shocking thing about it is that it came from Sony Pictures Animation!! But they got lucky with Arthur Christmas, Surf's Up, and the Pirates! Band of Misfits, and they're not the only one that made this film. I can see how it was also from Original Film, Scholastic, and Village Roadshow Pictures. I really love this movie. I never thought this was from SPA. This is the animated/live-action hybrid Sony Pictures Animation movie I would prefer over the Smurfs films. It combined Live-Action with Animation right! The live-action sequences may be wild, but they're not the worst live-action sequences anyone has ever seen. However, the animation is so hardcore and awesome, with the monsters and the visuals. This movie is WAY better than Hotel Transylvania and its sequel, and it's also better than the Smurfs and Cloudy. I'd prefer this, Surf's Up, Pirates!, and Arthur Christmas over most of the other films SPA has made.",Goosebumps

116,keithlovesmovies,Goosebumps Review,8,22 November 2015,"Zach Cooper (Dylan Minnette), distraught after moving from the big city of New York to a small town with his mother Gale (Amy Ryan), finds a silver lining when he meets his neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush). The teen is then surprised to learn that her mysterious, recluse, father is R.L. Stine (Jack Black), the famous best-selling author of the ""Goosebumps"" series. When Zach accidentally summons the monsters from Stine's tales, it's up to Stine, his daughter, Zach, and his friend Champ (Ryan Lee) to return the monsters to the books from which they came.I will just start off by saying I saw the film in 3D and I found that it did not add much to the story and the experience and was just another excuse to charge more money. Based on subject matter alone, this will probably make a lot of money anyway. I've been a big fan of the Goosebumps series ever since I was a kid. I don't think I've read all of the books but I enjoyed the ones I did so I was curious to see how they would make it into a film. I thought the story started off as a little cliché and original based on the circumstances in which Zach and his mom moved to where they did but I'm glad the film did not dwell on it too much. I was also surprised by how funny the film was as I thought the filmmakers did a great job at using comedy to break up the film's more serious and scary moments. They were able to succeed at this thanks to smart dialogue for the most part and jokes and one-liners which rarely missed. The primary sources of the comedy were from Ryan Lee's Champ who was serviceable despite bombing a few times and Jillian Bell as Zach's aunt Lorraine who I found a little cringy at times. There were also a pair of inept cops (Timothy Simons and Amanda Lund) that I thought were underused. I thought the acting all around in this to be very good, especially Minnette and Black. Minette's Zach, despite not being very deep as a character development-wise, kept my interest and led the film well enough. Black's Stine was great here as a character similar to other characters he has played. He had some great moments and funny exchanges with the other actors. His character progression was rather predictable but this is a kids film. What made it entertaining was the chemistry the four actors had as I found they played well off of each other. Some may not like the pace of the film but I didn't mind. I thought the special effects were good but not great as the film depicted a series of Stein's monsters from the Abominable Snowman, to a giant Premantis, evil gnomes, etc using CGI (perhaps too much). The most prominent of these monsters is Slappy the dummy (voiced by Black). He is the main villain of the film but I thought he brought the film down with his bad dialogue. I much rather preferred the scenes with the four actors against the monsters. The other thing I didn't like were a few twists in the story which I thought did not add anything. Overall, this a great kids film that shouldn't be too scary for kids and one that they and adults should enjoy.Score: 8.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com",Goosebumps
117,Blazehgehg,Not Bad,7,6 June 2016,"With this kind of blockbuster, kid-friendly, CGI-filled spectacle, it's easy to assume Goosebumps might not be a very good movie. Most movies of its type aren't, really.But here's the deal: this movie? This movie's alright. As a grown adult man-child, more than a few of the jokes got me to laugh, and it was really great remembering all of the Goosebumps books I read while I was growing up. This is thankfully not a movie that talks down to anyone, nor does it go for lowest-common-denominator humor.It's the kind of movie that, if I was 14, I'd probably grow up genuinely loving as one of my favorite movies of all time. Unfortunately I'm over 30, but it's still pretty cool.The only complaints I'd have is that Jack Black is kind of overdoing it a little bit. I understand that it's Jack Black, and you don't put him in a movie unless you expect him to be a ham, but he chews scenery just a little too hard for my tastes. Something about it rubs me the wrong way.But it's still a good movie. Worth watching, especially if you have fond memories of any of the Goosebumps media throughout the years.",Goosebumps
118,taryllsbaker,A beginning. A middle. And a twist.,6,22 February 2016,"Goosebumps is directed by Rob Letterman (Gulliver's Travels, Shark Tale) and stars Jack Black, Dylan Minnette, Odeya Rush & Ryan Lee. A lonely teenager, Zach Cooper, attaches himself to his new neighbour Hannah, attempting to overcome his father's passing. After a disturbance, he discovers that her father is acclaimed novelist and author of the 'Goosebumps' book series; R. L. Stine. Zach stumbles upon Stine's book collection, and accidentally unlocks the monsters inside, putting the lives of those around him in danger...This is a fun-fuelled film for all of the family. Jack Black stars as Stine and brings his usual charm and over-the-top characteristics from other roles that we've all become familiar with. Minnette moves the story along smoothly with his performance as Zach and converses and interacts with Odeya and the monsters nicely. Ryan Lee is the highlight of the cast as Champ who is a Goosebumps fanboy with a passion for R. L. Stine's work. He delivers some of the better one-liners which you'd expect from a film of this nature. The story itself is very simple and at times predictable. I knew this wouldn't be an 'incredible blockbuster' just watching the trailer. But I did enjoy it, nevertheless. I'd heard some good things about the film and how it was one of the better works in the 'family/monster/disaster' category. It definitely is, I just felt it needed a little more excitement. The screenplay lacked something that was needed to lift and throttle the thrill from the more mundane sequences. It lacked monsters, which I found surprising when the film tells a story solely about these strange and creepy creations by Stine. Fans of the book series may be disappointed with this, but yet happy to see a film dedicated to the bigger and renowned monsters. Having not read the books, I can't comment on this.The score by Danny Elfman is breathtakingly good. It feels great to hear the darker tone in his music drifting back onto the screen. He is known for his more 'epic' string arrangements and action-packed orchestral touch, and does not disappoint with this score. I instantly bought the album on iTunes and listening to it without the picture proves that his music works just as well on its own as it does with the film.The CGI characters felt rushed and very low in detail. It was like watching a film from a few years ago, and with how advanced computer imaging is becoming, it's easy to tell what pops and what blends. This didn't blend well for me. The actors performed well enough for you to believe the monsters were there, however. I do think that children and parents alike will find something beautiful in the storytelling about love, passion and friendship. It's entertaining, packed with action and contains a few comedic moments too. It's possible that there could be a sequel, depending on the reactions from the fans. Honestly, I wouldn't doubt it for a second and I'd happily sit through another adventure in this world.My verdict; Goosebumps attempts to pull you through the mind of R. L. Stine and while it does succeed at this, it doesn't quite hit as hard as it should have. There may be a few scarier scenes for the younger audience, but overall it's a film for the family and will most likely please those who are fans of the book series. Goosebumps, 6/10.",Goosebumps

Jack Black is a great choice as R.L.

Not enough depth to the characters or the story.It does have a few nice moments, but they're not enough to justify the film as a whole. The CGI was decent, gave me Robin Williams' Jumanji vibes.However, the script was very weak and certainly doesn't pay much homage to R. L. Stine's books; even the cheesy 90s TV series did it far better than this. It's almost as if it forgets that Goosebumps is supposed be all about...well, giving you Goosebumps!

But I did see a few of the earlier movies, that had been based on one particular book. This movie, that incorporated all of the monsters, was much better than the other ones I had seen. But then again, those were made specifically for kids, and this one was for a wider audience.This one still kept the cheesy lines that the other ones had, but it also had more of a storyline then just the kids running away from the monsters. Although this one still had that, just more towards the end.There were actually a couple of twists that I didn't see coming, so that was really refreshing. And I really enjoyed the scenes where there was more one on one with a particular monster. The werewolf scene in the supermarket was filled with tension, and done really well. I would have to say the one thing that I wish this movie had done more of was the one on one scenes. I would recommend this film. It was a fun romp, filled with teenage angst, monster chases, and some pretty cool special effects, especially the giant praying mantis.",Goosebumps

125,ryanmark-57919,Goosebumps Knows how to do Nostalgia the Correct Way,8,17 October 2015,"I wasn't too sure about this one when I went into the theater but I came out liking it more than I thought I would. It's a really cute movie and I smiled throughout the whole thing. I wouldn't say it's the kind of film that will elicit many laugh out loud moments but it's definitely good enough to elicit some giggles and I'm sure children as well as adults will enjoy it. The people that will really get a kick out of this movie are the ones that grew up with the Goosebumps books, like I did. I'm surprised how many of these characters I still recognized after so long. Fortunately, you don't really require any prior knowledge of these characters to enjoy the film but it certainly helps for those more nostalgic people like myself. Let's get to the story.Zach (Dylan Minnette) and his mother Gale (Amy Ryan) have just moved to a small town in Delaware called Madison. Gale has been hired to be the new Vice Principal at the local high school and they have both gone to start their new lives. The passing of Zach's father has been rough on the family and Zach isn't quite over it. Fortunately, Zach soon makes new friends with the socially awkward Champ (Ryan Lee) and his mysterious neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush). Zach does have a few problems when he finds out that Hannah's father is actually R.L. Stine (Jack Black) and that all of his Goosebumps characters are actually creations that have just been freed from their confinement in magical manuscripts. It's going to be a rough night.I pretty much figured this was going to be the case when I watched the film but Jack Black easily steals every scene he's in. This guy just has the ability to be hilarious in everything he's doing. His comedic timing is excellent and his serious face manages to crack me up more than anything. I especially liked the weird rivalry he felt towards Stephen King. Dylan Minnette does a good job as the main protagonist of the film and is a lot more likable than most of the young actors I see in movies geared towards children. It's nice to see that he doesn't try to act cool or anything. Odeya Rush also does a great job as Stine's daughter Hannah. Once again, she's mysterious but not because she's going out of her way to be mysterious. I feel like these are kids that I was around when I went to school. Ryan Lee is basically the comedic sidekick and he honestly does a pretty good job at it. His screams are magnificent and his confident but awkward attitude makes him one of the funnest characters in the film. I also found myself giggling at Jillian Bell's character Lorraine. I love it when we have these characters that are so oblivious to everything around them but are still so confident. She pulls it off perfectly.I think we really know why anyone would be interested in this film. The monsters. My Lord are there a lot of them. The Abominable Snowman, the Werewolf of Fever Swamp, Lawn Gnomes, Aliens, Killer Clown, Zombies, and so much more. I'm impressed how many creatures they managed to get into the film. They're all great but the best one and the main antagonist of the movie is Slappy the Dummy (don't call him that). I think Slappy showed up in the largest number of Goosebumps books and let's face it, the cover of that first book of his was kind of freaky looking. You know it was. Slappy is kind of an anti-Stine and the movie hints that Slappy is a representation of Stine's own dark side. Slappy leads the other monsters in their quest to take over the town and capture their creator. He also seems to have the ability to vanish or move ridiculously fast. Some of the best parts in the film is seeing Stine and Slappy argue with one another (Black plays both characters). The cgi on some of the monsters is a little cartoony but it works well in a film like this. It's a kid's film basically and the creatures look like they fit in a more light-hearted film like this one.The only thing that didn't really work for me was when Zach was supposed to be portrayed as being similar to Stine. The movie wants us to believe that Zach has closed himself to the world in a similar fashion to Stine but that is quite obviously not the case. Zach converses with others quite easily and is actually a very witty kid. Stine creates monsters and killer clowns to be his friends. I'm not seeing the connection very well and I personally believe that it was a bit forced.Honestly, this film is really fun and I would recommend anyone to go see it. You don't need to be caught up on the books or anything like that. The monsters and characters are enjoyable and the plot is completely bizarre but that just makes it even funner. If you feel like seeing a really good and wacky film then give this one a try.",Goosebumps
126,terrellrobinson71,"Never underestimate the imagination of a few powerful books...""Goosebumps"" is spellbinding family entertainment",9,29 April 2016,"You know the expression ""kids like to be scared nowadays""? Well, let's just say that there was one author who knew how to whip up one...no make that over 100 stories that would scared the living #2 out of kids as well as their parents. That was the ""Goosebumps"" series written by R.L. Stine. Personally, I have read some of his books as well as growing up with the ""Goosebumps"" T.V. series back in the 90's. But I never would've thought that they would be interested in turning it into a movie. I was concerned that the filmmakers would pick a story and translated to film, because there are so many ""Goosebumps"" books. Wisely, with the help of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (of Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"" and ""Big Eyes""), who wrote the story and Darren Lemke (of ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" and ""Shrek Forever After"") who studied the blueprints of Alexander & Karaszewski and turned it into a screenplay, they came up with the clever idea of not having one monster, but over 50 of Stine's monsters (or unless I counted it wrong) in one movie, but with an original story to go with it. That's what made this ""Goosebumps"" movie for me an exciting experience. The story is one you heard of before, but spun in a witty and fresh way. It follows a teen named Zach Cooper (the incredible Dylan Minnette) who, after the loss of his father, moved from New York to Madison, Delaware with his mom (Amy Ryan, Oscar nominee of ""Gone Baby Gone"") who is the new principal of his new school. Once he arrives, he becomes friends with next-door neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush), but is quickly shooed away by her dad, Mr. Shivers (Jack Black) who warns the young boy to stay away from both of them. One night, things do get a bit bumpy and Zach and his new friend Champ (""Super 8""'s scene-stealer Ryan Lee), who was ""born with the gift of fear"", to investigate what's going on. Who knew that Mr. Shivers had a secret of his own that made people stay away from him? He happens to be R.L. Stine himself. Anyway, the two friends discovers the manuscripts of ""Goosebumps"" and Zach unintentionally opens one of them, releasing the Abominable Snowman of Pasadena. Now with some of the monsters, which includes lawn gnomes, ghouls, The Werewolf of Fever Swamp, a giant praying mantis, The Invisible Boy (voiced by Black) and a ventriloquist's dummy---sorry, puppet named Slappy (also voiced with such uproarious zest by Black) who serves as our main antagonist, leaping off the pages of their books, it's up to our four heroes to put them back into the books before Madison will become a real ""Horrorland"". In the tradition of movies of the 80's and 90's like ""The Goonies"", ""Gremlins"", and ""Jumanji"" (also add ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"", and ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"", if you have to), ""Goosebumps"", directed by Rob Letterman, is a fun family movie that is hilarious, charming and wonderfully thrilling with plenty of good old- fashioned scares that is not too scary, but scary enough for kids ages 9 & up. The adults who know or don't know about ""Goosebumps"" will also enjoy it and will get to savor in Jack Black's over-the-top funny and warm performance, reminding us with movies like ""Shallow Hal"", ""School of Rock"" and the ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies what an amazing comedic and tender presence he has. The three kids are quite impressive and likable, which is good. And even the superb supporting cast (including the always hilarious Jillian Bell as Zach's boy-crazy Aunt Lorraine, Timothy Simons and Amanda Lund as the two most dim-witted police officers in movie history and an underutilized Ken Marino as the coach who nearly hits on Principal Cooper) doesn't hurt, too. Plus, the screenplay provides some really funny insights (and in-jokes) on the ""Goosebumps"" stories, Stine making a few off-handed comments about ""Steve"" King: ""I've sold way more books than him, but no one ever talks about that! Ever!"" and delivering some solid one-liners, some of them come from the lovable, but wimpy Champ. I hope we get to have some more family films like this. Usually, we don't get a lot of smart live-action family films that aren't rude, sloppy or reaching for masochistic pain. It's a very good thing that ""Goosebumps"" belongs in that category because we all have to pick up a book one day and get lost in the world of imagination. That's what we all need, that's my philosophy. Plus, it's nice to be scared by something as classic as this. And, as Mr. Stine pointed out, every great story has a beginning, a middle and a twist. This is one of the best family films of 2015.",Goosebumps
127,trooper5783,Extremely surprised- intense and sometimes hysterical!,9,27 October 2015,"First things first- I grew up with the Goosebumps books and TV show. When I saw the trailer pop up when I went to watch Minions, I expected it to be your typical horrible live- action/CGI adaptation of something that was good back in its day, but with Goosebumps, it's a fun, upbeat, hilarious and charming surprise. The only problems with the movie is that the visuals are a mixed bag(some are really cool and refreshing, some are cheap- Alvin And The Chipmunks quality CGI) and it tries to be hip, but otherwise, the movie's awesome! The action scenes really had me shocked on how creative they're set up to be(the ice rink Abominable Snowman sequence, the praying mantis chase) and the 3D really added to the imagination of the intensity. The comedy is also very witty, with most of it being sharp verbal gags and occasionally a goofy visual joke. Goosebumps is the most fun(excluding The Martian) I've had at the movies since Ant-Man, and it's good, clean, funny and intense entertainment that families will have a great time with. Stick around for a cool 3D credit sequence if you pay for the extra dimension.",Goosebumps
128,TheBarleyGuy,Not even for nostalgia's sake,4,25 December 2015,"Growing up, I was the biggest fan of R.L. Stine's books. From Goosebumps to the much sexier Fear Street, I was all over it. Even the television show, made here in Canada, was able to get me excited and enthusiastic. It was probably the beginning of my love of the genre really, and with such a massive amount of stories, I was never in short supply of kid-friendly thrills and chills. While my love for that time of my life, and the impact that Stine had on my childhood are certainly held in high esteem, I have no nostalgic blinders on when it comes to the quality, particularly of the television series. Trying to watch the series in 2015 is nearly impossible, with the staggeringly low production values and quality in the performances. I strongly recommend the Jontron video on the subject actually, it puts things into jarring perspective if you ask me.So, what I had hoped for from this movie was at least a bit of a tickle of the ol' nostalgia-bone, and perhaps some yuks from, the usually charming, Jack Black. What I got instead was a complete and total mess, crammed full of characters who are recognizable-ish, and a story that goes all over the place trying to make things work that just don't. The movie is directed by Rob Letterman, who previously brought the wretched Jack Black vehicle, Gulliver's Travels to the big screen. So, with that track record and THREE credited writers, Darren Lemke (Turbo), Scott Alexander (Ed Wood), and Larry Karaszewski (Big Eyes), the movie quickly devolves into a jumbled mess and can't bring itself out of it.For some reason, the lead monster is Slappy the ventriloquist dummy, voiced by Jack Black, and there is some implication that this character, more than any other, has the deepest connection to R.L. Stine, to the point that Slappy leads the monster army and they follow him without question. There's an attempt to combine the stories and make them have some relation to each other, but each book was a separate entity unto itself and the fact that Slappy (from the 7th book in the series), is any more or less important than, say, Carly Beth (from my personal favourite, The Haunted Mask). I had a hard time understanding why the story choice to focus around Slappy, beyond the fact that dolls are the ""creepy"" thing right now. Perhaps some attempt to cash in on Annabelle? Who knows.There are a couple of creepy moments and the animation used in the movie isn't the worst thing I've ever seen, but it just doesn't work in the grand scheme. I did find the initial encounter with the lawn gnomes effectively creepy, but its soon over and replaced by a ridiculous werewolf in shorts, and it just falls so flat over and over, and I found the complete under utilization of the Haunted Mask offensive to my own personal nostalgic viewing of the movie.Performance wise, you have Jack Black coasting through most of the movie, giving a fairly ordinary performance. He is a naturally funny guy, and he's not unfunny in the movie, but his presence doesn't add much, which was pretty unfortunate. You also have performances from the relatively bland Dylan Minette (Prisoners), who doesn't have much to do except play ""Generic Teen Hero"", and his sidekick played by Ryan Lee (Super 8) who isn't terrible, but again doesn't bring much to the hollow movie. You also have Odeya Rush (We Are What We Are) who serves as the hero's prize for a job-well-done in the end of the movie, but does one of the better jobs all around. We spend a considerable amount of time with all of these characters, and they feel so poorly defined and half-cooked that they're as forgettable as the movie itself.At the end of the day, you have a weak movie that doesn't really do any favours for the series that it's based on. It's a jumbled mess, with too many monsters AND it has the audacity to sequel bait as well. A real disappointment, and not something I would really even recommend for nostalgia's sake. Give this one a pass, and have yourselves a merry little Christmas.www.barleydoeshorror.com",Goosebumps

133,PandoraProductions4,good for kids,6,18 October 2015,"R.L Stine's books have been extremely popular in the last twenty years, selling hundreds of millions of copies. It's definitely gained a place in the pop culture psyche. The books served as a sort of kids equivalent to Stephen King, doling out scares that were scary enough, yet not deeply disturbing. Surprisingly, this is the first time a theatrical film has been made from the books, though there have been numerous TV shows based on them over time. This Goosebumps movie is not an adaption of any particular R.L Stine story, though most of the monsters in it will be recognized by fans of the books.The plot follows a similar structure to any typical goosebumps. Zach (Dylan Minnette), a typical teenage boy, moves into a new neighbourhood where nothing seems to happen. He soon meets a couple new friends, geeky Champ (Ryan Lee), and the mysterious Hannah (Odeya Rush). Hannah's father is the enigmatic R.L Stine himself (a comically over the top performance by Jack Black). Mr. Stine is a misanthrope, who hides away in his house with original manuscripts of his books. When Zach accidentally opens one, the fearsome creatures from Goosebumps literally jump off the page and terrorize the town.It's standard fare, not particularly original, but it works well enough. The monsters swarming reminded me of the finale of Cabin In The Woods, though Cabin pulled it off much more effectively.Though most kids will enjoy the adventure elements, and laugh at all the right places, anyone older will be disappointed.Goosebumps is not a horror-comedy. There's elements of horror, and an overabundance of comedy, but they never seamlessly meld.I wanted more black comedy and less predictable quips.The humour is very very predictable. The music will stop and then: (insert joke), then the payoff. This is all very well if it happens once or twice, but this type of lowbrow comedy gets old very fast.That's not say the Goosebumps movie is entirely without merit. There's many clever aspects, I chuckled quite a few times. Some of the visuals look cool (some don't).The musical score by Danny Elfman (who else) is pretty generic, but helps keep things moving.What else? The villain is a bit wooden. (ha ha) And there's a clever cameo by R.L Stine.Kids will love this movie.",Goosebumps
134,Sruthi_Me,Not a Goosebumps fan - Do Not Bother,4,18 November 2015,"I have no idea how people give such high scores to crappy movies on IMDb. My score of a 4 is me being generous. 1. Direction - Okay. I guess the director did do a good job! The animation was on spot. There was no shoddy scenes or weird cuts. 2. Writing - Oh my god. Kill me already. Boring. Boring and so very Boring. I don't know how many times I dosed of during the film. The story was dry, monotonous and a complete, utter waste of time. 3. Acting - Well, Jack Black blew us away as usual. The ""Champ"" guy was pretty awesome too and so was the puppet. I think personally, the two that really let me down were the hero and the heroine. There was negative chemistry literally between the two. They could have passed off as siblings. Watching them kiss was just down right weird. 4. Production design - Loved the costumes, the outfits and the props. It tied the movie up very nicely. 5. Sound - The sound track and the background score wasn't memorable. I indeed liked a couple of songs but they were not exclusive to the movie and were pop songs already out on the internet.Bottomline - GO watch if you used to read Goosebumps in your younger days. Go watch if you are 10 or below. Go watch if your kid is 10 or below. Else, do not bother.",Goosebumps
135,ReelBrew,"After moving in next-door to author RL Stine, a boy must team up with the girl next-door in order to capture all the creatures of Goosebumps.",6,13 December 2015,"I was six years old in my local neighborhood bookstore when I first caught the deliriously pop-inspired title to R.L. Stine's menacing Goosebumps; the hauntingly bright title seeming to push itself off the cover. There was an alarming comfort in the art, evoking a playfulness that came equipped to scare and delight. I immediately begged my mom to buy it for me, my eagerness to jump into the story of this soon to be scholastic phenomenon palpable. The characters introduced within the pages leapt from their world into mine, my imagination running amok with empathetic heroes and hostile zombies. With Goosebumps, a live-action culmination of almost every book written in its five year run, we are treated to the fiends and faces that many of us grew up with. Overflowing with whimsy and delight, it can often feel like a universe that's best kept to our own imagination, falling short on atmospheric tone and peril, playing it safe around almost every corner. However, deep down there's a story filled with heart and inventiveness that has the extraordinary power to stir the cauldron of creativity, which as one of the characters states, ""Has to be worth something.""Dropping us into the dreaded town of Madison Delaware, we are quickly introduced to Zach (Dylan Minnette) who according to his Aunt was an ugly baby but gets more handsome with every year. Both Zach and his mother Grace (Amy Ryan), who is also his Vice Principal have just moved from New York City only a year after the loss of a loved one. Without wasting any time Zach meets next door neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush) and her father, one sarcastically sweet, the other dour and cantankerous. Shortly after discovering that Hannah's father is R.L. Stine (Jack Black), creatures spanning all sixty-two Goosebumps begin leaping from the pages and onto the streets of Madison, led by the sinister ventriloquist Slappy (voiced by Jack Black) from the infamous Night of the Living Dummy. What ensues is the ultimate collaboration between fiction and nonfiction as Zach, his newly acquainted friend Champ (Ryan Lee), and Hannah along with her father must create the apogee of literature in order to defeat the entire Goosebumps universe.Seeing all of your favorite ghouls, ghastlys, demons, creatures, abominations and one dummy (who loathes being called that) literally leap from between the pages of some of our most cherished books is a sight that stirs both the imagination and agitates the eyes. Every literary shape that manifests itself from Goosebumps swirls, billows, twists and turns its way into our world, moving at a breakneck speed that feels inimical to our senses. It's a distraction throughout the film, a bombardment of our collective reasoning that asks us to come along for the ride, and for the most part we do so willingly. There is pure escapism in what director Rob Letterman brings to the screen; a feast for our imagination and nostalgia for what that once meant. It's an excessively hyperkinetic film that credits itself to Jumanji and A Night at the Museum rather than films like E.T. and Monster Squad. With every scene our nostalgic reasoning wants us to harken back to a slower period before technology swept us away, yet we are continually inundated with a whirlwind of images that can at times drown out the voice of the film.At the core of Goosebumps is a pulse that beats profoundly with creativity and adoration for the imagination, with an honest wit that drives our characters into our hearts. When we discover that Zach's father is no longer with them, which we learn through the natural course of adult conversation, Zach notes that he's going to unpack his room to knock it off his bucket list. It's with quick humor that we uncover deeper context, which screenwriter Darren Lemke places throughout the film. In the midst of the chaos caused by the monsters, we are given glimpses of pain and heart that's handled with immense care. We are shown that some of the most important and significant things, the ones we hold dear to us are best remembered, kept for us to embrace whenever we want. It's a message that gets lost with a formulaic and all-too safe ending, but it's one that continues to ring once the curtain closes. From jocular dialogue, sincere characters and ardent direction told in an all too frenetic pace, Goosebumps manages to supply the entire family with something to hold onto, and that has to count for something.",Goosebumps
136,starcraftbw88,Average,6,3 February 2016,"About what I expected, even as a fan of the books when I were younger - it was a very average (but not bad) movie. It had the comical, cheesy, familiar tone book readers have come to expect from the PG horror; it transferred over to the movie pretty well (save for anything actually scary), though maybe a few too many bad puns and jokes for my taste. The movie did alright, I'm not really feeling there's anything specific I'd like to bash or praise about it. I probably enjoyed it a bit more as a fan of the books, because the references are in there. Nostalgia probably kicked up my score a point, the movie did not impress on any fronts, but again, exactly what I expected out of the movie.",Goosebumps
137,jezfernandez,Enjoyable but flawed (minor plot points revealed),7,7 November 2016,"Ever since Empire gave this 4 stars, I've wanted to see this and finally bought it on DVD. My hopes started high, with some great comedy moments with Zach's try-hard aunt and the two inept cops. However, once the monsters are unleashed, the movie becomes entirely preoccupied with a race-against-time plot and those nuanced characters get hopelessly lost in lazy clichés. Everything in the script is too easy.MINOR SPOILERS: Zach meets a cute girl right next door and she's immediately into him. There's an improbably spectacular location introduced at the start, which you know is being set up for later in the film. The geeky sidekick gets to play hero to the most gorgeous girl in the school. And so on it goes. Worse still, the plot makes no sense in terms of how and why these monsters are unleashed in the first place.By the time the action gets going, it's as if the execs said ""Don't bother will all that clever dialogue and character development - we just want a Gremlins/Small Soldiers type affair"". The movie never stops long enough to give its characters breathing space, so the writer is forced to shoehorn in some truly cringe-inducing sentimentality.For all that, Goosebumps is a good fun ride, albeit with some sub-standard CGI. Enjoy it - just try not to think about it too hard.",Goosebumps
138,MrAwesome1022,Quite Entertaining,7,8 November 2015,"I did not have high expectations coming into this film, long had I forgotten how much I enjoyed these books as a child. It pushes the edge of what is acceptable for small children, yet I would not see any problems with a five years old seeing the film.Odeya Rush and Amy Ryan provided quality performances, I felt they were more engaging than Jack Black. Rush has a bit of charm to go with her natural beauty which will allow her flexibility in the future if she has quality representation.While Black was not bad he just didn't ""feel"" like RL Stine if you ever have seen an interview with the author. His performance felt like Jack Black playing himself, which does has entertainment quality within itself. I was not impressed with Dylan Minnette, he has a long way to go as an actor.The story arc was all encompassing of Stine's work and made use of his more popular characters. Unfortunately the dialogue was slightly off, yet was acceptable for being catered towards children.Overall it is an enjoyable movie that everyone can enjoy. I could definitely see more Goosebumps movies in the future.Real Score: 6.8",Goosebumps
139,robhigg2203,Not quite spot on from the books but still a fun and entertaining nostalgia filled film,8,5 February 2016,"Unlike with many films based on books and in this case to a lesser extent old TV shows I was a fan of Goosebumps when the books and TV show was at the peek of its success. Years later while there are found memories of both (although a little vague in some areas), it was something that only occasionally came to mind. I saw the TV show again on Netflix some time ago and I can't say I stood up although I know there are still kids discovering them years later today. Given that it was been around for as long as it has it seemed surprising that it took this long for there to be a film to be made. But with this likely to be the decade for 90s Nostalgia and with more 90s kids stuff getting big screen reboots with a new Power Rangers movie out next year it seems right to try and beat the competition to it. First off this is not directly based on any specific book from the series, but acts as a original story acting as Nostalgia for the books featuring RL Stein's monsters brought to life like never before. The Books are definitely a main focus as Jack Black is playing a fictionalised version of its author and in this universe there is no mention of a previous adaptation having took place. If anything it seems to be in some ways targeted at Nostalgic adults as well as their kids, with some of the self referential moments more likely to mean more to my fellow ""90s kids"" than it would to their kids. But this is film very much a film both fans of the original and their own kids alike. At first it sound like the firmilar formula, the new kid Zack moves into a new town and is suspicious of the weird next door neighbour who turns out to be RL Stein. RL Stein was someone I remember being in the TV show but this would be the first time he (played by Jack Black in this case) plays a big part in the story. It was somewhat slow to get going at the start but it does do a good job of introducing the main characters. The main character does have a relatable back story and is very much of his time (as in 2015), and would even add to much (or most) self referential moments in the film. These being things like what they had in common with each other and how he should had stopped trying to be Stephen King who as it turns out while he had a higher sales per book average has not sold as many copies worldwide as RL Stein (that was a surprise actually). As far as the monsters in the film go, they do stay true to the original counterparts, although this is not a superhero movie it could have easily still have been a case of villain overload but it does not come across as such if anything it felt more like Jumanji with RL Stein's creations in place instead of wild animals. Only a few are heavily featured but there were many firmilar ones making come kind of cameo towards the end. But still some still remain pretty memorable and do stick and one which was one of those I recognised right away is a entertaining character. If it is effective in scaring kids might be something yet to be determined but it is going to be one kids might remember for a while.But is it really as good or better than the books or TV show? Really I would say it's better than I found the old TV show to be when I saw it again on Netflix a few years back. But I'd say the books were better, while this is a effective action/ adventure film it's not much in terms of children's horror. I remember the books have more of a slower pace and while as Zack jokes about in the film their are a lot of similarities story wise in each of the books some guessing and mystery is there in some way. This while entertaining and manages to be a fun film to watch is more focused on adventure. But still manages to stand out on its owns at least. So that's not all to bad for something to keep the kids entertained at least. So I guess in all it was an entertaining film, there was much to enjoy and it was fun to see in 3D as well. As for my fellow 90s kids, I am not sure how you would fellow 90s kids I don't know how you will feel about this film. Guess it will depend on how well you remember the book so really and what you thought of them at the time and even now years later but could still be worth checking out for the curious at least.",Goosebumps

141,nightcrawlercyp-311-219346,"Nice, but not that much",4,19 March 2016,"I gave a 4 because despite the awful story, the non-scary elements and despite every character (monster) is a lamer version of a character belonging to SK which apparently this writer surpasses (maybe in his dreams) from the clown (IT) the giant praying mantis (spider end of IT) the car (Christine) and so on. Then we have the extremely predictable story. By the time of the parent daughter fight I knew she was a monster. When it was revealed monsters came from books I knew she was one. Also another problem is that you never think that maybe they will fail or that anyone will actually die. You already know everything will end up fine so you are in no way impressed. The whole typewriter thing reminds me of ""In the mouth of madness"" and many others that hare a similar subject. But unlike those it is never explained how come the typewriter has that power, there is no explanation behind where those characters came from and so on. Also a lot of characters were not believable including Zach and Hannah. But despite all that I cannot claim I did not enjoy it so it has a 4 from me.",Goosebumps

I felt I was in for a really enjoyable experience, which I wasn't necessarily expecting in a film where the movie's plot is pretty predictable.But that's just the thing, with a predictable plot, the movie can only fly high when the humor is behind giving it the fuel and power. Once the first half of the movie was over, however, and the main plot ""thickens,"" the jokes fall flat; they even become predictable.

144,mhol111964-754-567942,The surprise of the fall,8,5 November 2015,"Let me star off by saying that I have never really read any of the Goosebumps books, but they were quite popular when I was a child. However, I have watched some episodes of the Goosebumps TV series, and I found it quite interesting.Then, I heard that there was a Goosebumps movie in the works and that Jack Black was going to be in it. Part of me was looking forward to it because of Jack Black (He's kinda one of my favorite celebrities), but another part of me was skeptical. Given that each installment in the ""Goosebumps"" series is a different story entirely, I was not sure how they would pull it off. Also, the trailer was not very convincing.That being said, I went and saw the film, and I must say that I was very impressed with it, and I enjoyed it very much.It actually has a very unique and interesting story line. We have these three teenagers, and R.L. Stine, and Stine has these manuscripts of his stories locked. One of the teenagers accidentally opens one of the Goosebumps manuscripts, releasing the monsters.For all we know, it could have just been an anthology of all of the different Goosebumps stories, but instead, the writers got creative and brought the stories together, followed by a plot involving the Goosbumps monsters unleashed from R.L. Stine's manuscripts and wreaking havoc across the town.Jack Black plays a fictional version of R.L. Stine (the author of the Goosebumps series). Black actually portrays his character quite well, and is quite funny (as usual). At first, Stine comes off as a jerk, but once you find out his secret, you actually care for him.It also has some good chemistry between the two protagonists Zach and Hannah, and Dylan Minnette and Odeyah Rush deliver impressive performances that capture it.The film is also very fun and entertaining. There is not a single moment in the film where I was bored. Slappy the Dummy basically stole the show. Whenever Slappy is on screen, he brings forth a laugh, and a scare at once. I also loved the grocery store scene with the werewolf.I do not want to spoil anything, but that twist (and yes, there IS a twist) got me. Also, the real R.L. Stine makes an appearance somewhere in the film.There are a couple of problems that I had with the film. One of them is that, while I cared for Zach and Hannah, it seems to rely a bit too much on the romance aspect. Another problem is that it relies a little too much on CGI to the point where it looked cartoon-ish in some areas. But those things did not ruin the movie for me.Overall, Goosebumps is a very fun and creative family-friendly spooky thrill ride, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the franchise.",Goosebumps

It was extremely funny and had a great story. The writing and acting were great as well. I really loved Jack black he was amazing. I really loved the whole thing as it was well put together. Well shot and filmed also. My only concern is the movie had most of the less know, less popular book villains. I didn't see the haunted mask, Jack o lanterns, scarecrow, monster blood, etc. CGI could have been better. But all in all I really enjoyed watching it and I recommend for you to see it.

I have to say that I found Goosebumps The Movie to be incredibly enjoyable. Going in I set my expectations really low, and still expected disappointment, but this movie never failed to deliver. Out of all the movies I have taken my son to see this year, this one was without a doubt my favorite. Jack Black, as usual, was an absolute riot as R.L. Stine. I'm not going to get into the overall plot or anything, but I do feel that there were a few things that could have been explored more. As other reviewers have stated I would have liked to maybe see one of the individual stories adapted into a movie instead of condensing them all into one, but all things considered it worked well enough. The characters were mostly likable, with only one who kind of got annoying at times. Nothing too bad though, the kind of thing you'd expect from a movie like this. Some parents may fear that it might be too scary for their kids, but from a parent of a 4 year old that's highly unlikely.

I didn't think too much about this movie and didn't expect to like it as much as I did. But this film was really a lot of fun!The story is about Zach who, together with his mom, moves in next to R.L. Stine, the author of the Goosebumps books. After a misunderstanding revolving around R.L. Stine's daughter Hannah, Zach learns the Goosebump books monsters are realand dangerous.The movie starts rather slow and takes its time to set up the story and meet the characters. Usually kids films seem in a rush to get to the action parts. I like that we see the relationship Zach has with his mom and i enjoyed the banter between them. In general the characters were amazing and the casting was excellent. Jack Black was good as the sometimes intimidating R.L. Stine. I like seeing him in a less goofball role, although R.L. Stine also has his funny moments. 'Goosebumps' is not scary at all, at least not for adults. But that doesn't mean the monsters aren't creative and interesting. They seem very big and their design is exceptional.'Goosebumps' is a fun movie especially to see around halloween. It's a little spooky and scary without any harm, it definitely won't give you any nightmares. It reminds me of the halloween movies I saw as a kid like 'Hocus Pocus'.

153,alexrwatson-888-169026,A Nostalgic Good Time,6,1 January 2016,"NOSTALGIA WARNING: I grew up reading the Goosebumps books and watching the Goosebumps TV show religiously. My first nightmare I can remember involved The Haunted Mask. Goosebumps was a big part of my childhood, so I was very excited to see this movie.The Goosebumps movie is about actual Goosebumps writer R.L. Stine's (played by Jack Black) books coming to life. The film is directed by Rob Letterman and is written by a few different writers which include Darren Lemke, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski. The nostalgic and movie critic side in me compromised; and we came to the conclusion that the film adaptation of Goosebumps is a fun reminder for the people who grew up reading them, and an entertaining diversion for the kids new to the series.Goosebumps' premise is genius. Having the villains from all of R.L. Stine's books come to life to terrorize him and the town is a fantastic way to adapt his many novels to the big screen. Does the story have its dumb moments? Absolutely but the film does not take itself too seriously and has a tone consistent with the novels. Goosebumps does focus on only a couple of the Goosebumps villains, and it would have been nice to see more variety there. Slappy is the ringleader for all the other villains, which is perfect considering he's a fan favorite and always is pulling the strings.The single biggest problem I have with the film is Jack Black's interpretation of R.L. Stine. He plays the same bumbling crackup, and a lot of this I blame on the director. He's worked with Black in 3 of his 4 feature films, so it's not surprising that Jack Black does the exact same ole thing.I didn't have a problem with any of the other performances, and my personal favorite was Ryan Lee as Champ. The kid is perfect comic relief, and nearly everything out of this his mouth is pure gold. The film is very funny in general, with the two cops stealing their few scenes.Goosebumps is aimed more at a new audience of kids, but I feel as if the film missed out on opportunities to slip in some fan service. That being said, there are some nice nods to the original books. In particular, the ending is a perfect conclusion for a Goosebumps movie.Goosebumps is an entertaining movie for kids but also a fun walk down memory lane for the older ""kids"". Viewer beware.

154,tochukwu-83206,See it for for fun-nothing else,7,8 February 2016,"Goosebumps is crazy fun: doesn't take itself too seriously. It has enough monsters, but never for once does it come off as being horror. Its take-off is very familiar (So is its landing!) -very trite: dad is dead-mum and son moves into a small town in the middle of nowhere. And boy has a hard adjusting to new environment. There is an uncanny resemblance of the film to ""Scouts guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" from the perspective of monsters mayhem in a town. The film is also very similar to ""Jumanji"". The special effects look a little bit cheap, but that could be forgiven considering it's not a high budget film. By avoiding blood splatter and guts, the film clearly defines its target audiences: teens and young adults in their early twenty's who want to relive that high school experience. Amidst its fast pace setting comes the usual teenage themes of high school crush and dating. Creatively, it has nothing to offer. But I would recommend this type of film to an audience that is out for laughs and simple-mindedness: nothing too challenging. The performance of Ryan Lee as a nerd and a comedian is noteworthy. His character is the most relatable to among the bunch by his mere acceptance of fear and avoidance of heroics when compared to the others. Even though he doesn't necessarily do anything apart from screaming, he is still the type who you would want to see survive the ordeal. There are constant references to urban legends and classic horror films like (The Blob).",Goosebumps

I even had the chance to meet the master himself Mr. RL Stine.he was so incredibly friendly and so supportive of my writing. I was so touched when he wished me luck. There was room left open for another one and I hope hope hope they make it.

157,starry42,A Halloween treat for Goosebumps fans both old and new!,7,31 October 2015,"I, like many other kids growing up in the 90s, loved to read R.L. Stine's ""Goosebumps"" books, as well as watch the TV show. When I first heard that a movie was being made for 2015, I was a little worried. One part of me thought it was two decades too late for a movie, and the other part discovered a resurgence in popularity of the series for the new generation. My worries continued when I found out that Jack Black had been cast as R.L. Stine. I've always been mixed on Mr. Black. For every hit film he's had (e.g. School of Rock), he's had a couple of misses (e.g. Envy, Gulliver's Travels). When I saw the first trailer, I caught a glimpse of hope for it being decent, and boy were my hopes delivered.The story involves a teen boy named Zach, who has just moved to a new town. As is typical of this cliché, he does not like it and wants to go back home. He does manage to make a couple of new friends. A strange dorky boy named Champ, and the girl next door named Hannah, who has a very mysterious father. Her father is later revealed to be none other than R.L. Stine, the world renowned author of Goosebumps. One night, when Zach and Champ sneak into the Stine house, they come across a bookshelf full of Goosebumps manuscripts. Upon opening one, they come to a startling conclusion: the stories are alive. This becomes a bigger problem when Slappy the living ventriloquist dummy (voiced by Jack Black) comes to life and begins to spread the manuscripts across town, unleashing many Goosebumps monsters to wreak havoc onto the town. What follows is a fun and exciting adventure to stop these monsters.As far as the characters go, the teen characters are nothing really special. They are basically your cardboard teens, including the new kid in town and the dork who tries to be a hero. The actor who steals the show, however, is Jack Black. He portrays a funny fictional version of R.L. Stine, making him out to be an egomaniac who thrives on his success and despises Stephen King. All in all, I was surprised at how much I really liked the movie. It was a fun nostalgia trip, and fans from the 90s will appreciate it for that reason. The newer fans will probably like it too.",Goosebumps
158,krahl-81949,Goosebumps - Film Review,6,2 November 2015,"Most of my childhood was spent on books, in particular, the entire Goosebumps series. The wit, charm and humorous yet eery/creepy/scary angle that R.L. Stine brought to his books was something different for the genre. The same is captured in the movie to some extent, but on the whole, it remains an entertaining albeit simple film.The plot is threadbare, with Jack Black playing the role of the author, R.L. Stine himself. Black does a decent job as the extremely cautious shut-in author and surprisingly reigns in his usual excess energy for a soberer role. The obvious stars of the movie are the monsters, however, the real heart of the movie is the children.The main trio is formed by Dylan Minnette as Zach Cooper, Odeya Rush as Hannah and Ryan Lee as Champ. Dylan does a good job as a teen coping with changing situations in his life and Odeya plays her character with a subtle innocence that is sweet and charming. The one who shines though, is Ryan Lee, who is a complete riot as the bumbling nerdy misfit Champ.Continue reading the review at my blog below: https://microreels.wordpress.com/2015/10/30/goosebumps-film-review/",Goosebumps

160,warriorspirit,Strictly for kids and teens,5,24 January 2016,"If I was 10 years younger and perhaps 10 IQ points dumber I would loved loved this movie. This takes me back to those Nickoledian days, particularly their famous show ""Are you afraid of the dark"" where a group of kids would come together before midnight to tell scary stories to each other and stories of monsters coming out of books were among the most popular; so this entire movie could have fit like an extended episode in the series.Intellectually and emotionally this is at the level of high school with the classic high school tropes: young kid moves to a new school, falls in love with a weird girl, geeky virgin wants to get laid so desperately tries to be his friend, oh and there is high school prom. Of course with the major difference that a universe of monsters from the Goosebumps series have been accidentally unleashed on the town, and are going to crash that prom night.Technically, a well polished movie with good monster effects work, but which is becoming run of the mill stuff now in your typical Hollywoood teenie pic.",Goosebumps

162,wjets9,A Good Time,8,19 October 2015,"Goosebumps is a fun, family friendly movie. It captures the nostalgia from back when I was a kid, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie throughout.The essential storyline is, monsters are released from R.L. Stine's manuscripts and cause mayhem through the town. We follow as the main leads attempt to put an end to the madness.The actors do a decent job throughout, and Jack Black really excels as R.L. Stine. Aside from him, the main cast is made up of relative unknowns, however they do an adequate job.The special effects are very well done, and the monsters look real.Overall, I don't feel this movie is going to win any awards, but if you just want to have a good time at the movies, then go check it out.",Goosebumps
163,ldbellhayden,Fun time for the whole family!,8,12 November 2015,"I took my entire family to see this movie, and I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Everything about this screamed, remake of a property from the past, a washed up actor as one of the lead, etc., 'terrible movie', but I'm really glad that they actually made this quite well. I'd say if you need a movie for all ages then Goosebumps is your best best this fall/winter besides Peanuts and Good Dinosaur. I'm not going to say goosebumps is a perfect movie though, I mean a lot of the main plot points are clichés, and while I liked Black's performance because I thought it was over the top crazy (which he does quite well), others might not find it as amusing. Overall definitely a movie to check out! I watched the Goosebumps cartoon as a kid, and I'm happy to say this is better than previous iterations of R.L. Stein's Goosebumps",Goosebumps
164,hyperGermangirl,The Genius of Goosebumps,5,30 October 2015,"Tho I have not gotten around to reading his books, I trust the genius of R. L. Stine I have witnessed. The reason I like this movie so much is because of the tribute it paid to his genius. I loved how the monsters were animated, and I was passionate about and successful with doing art.The acting was certainly some good stuff. The hero came off well, I see, a cute, rather intellectual/intelligent boy. The girl seemed high-spirited but rather rebellious about who she has become. I did like the other boy, as well. He also seemed very smart emotionally. The actor who playing R. L. Stine was an interesting personality.About being together as a group, they did pretty good. They seemed to feature certain personalities with minor and background actors, that carefree ""I'm very white and I'm not perfect but I better be the only person in this situation getting any attention,"" catchy and addictive today for weird reasons. It was sorta like the catch phrase or the theme on a theme, the comic relief.",Goosebumps
165,mistergutsy2299,A Serviceable Movie,6,27 October 2015,"It seems like every year we're given a film by Hollywood to capitalize off of our nostalgia. Last year it was The Lego Movie and this year it's Goosebumps. However if the Lego Movie showed us anything it's that not every movie is a cash grab and that these movies can work if the directors are making it with heart.The movie revolves around a teen (whose name I've already forgotten) and his mother moving into your stereotypical small town in the middle of nowhere. His neighbors are a girl so bland she's literally got 'LOVE INTEREST' stamped across her forehead and (surprise) R.L. Stine, played by Jack Black.Eventually we find out that Stine's monsters from the Goosebumps series are real. Events transpire and the monsters escape from the books and are now roaming free. Our main characters now have to go out and entrap them back in their books, basically this movie is Ghostbusters for children. Now if you've read Goosebumps or watched the series then you'd know that there's a lot of monsters, ghouls, witches and all sorts of creeps in the books. You're probably wondering if each of them is in the movie and if they've got their own screen-time. Sad part is they don't. The movie mostly shows up the same monsters in every scene: a mantis, a dummy, a werewolf, and the abominable snowman. This is going to be very disappointing to you if you've read the books and wanted your favorite monster to show up.So how were the actors in this movie? Well they were serviceable. They got the job done but it's certainly no Haley Joel Osment performance. The main lead is a hunky guy who I assume is there as eye candy, the female lead is a love interest. Nothing more. I did like the stereotypical awkward dorky best friend played by Ryan Lee (who played a similar role in the fantastic Super 8.) However even he started to wear thin by the end of the movie. Jack Black is in his usual bumbling man role. He's actually not bad as R.L. Stine but it's not a performance you'll remember.The movie is also very fast paced. The characters are running around from one set piece to the next with only short scenes in between where we expand on their characters. The movie slides by very fast without a moment of boredom for your kids.Now onto the cons. The amount of CGI in this movie is absolutely ludicrous. There's good CGI out there and there's unnecessary CGI. This movie suffers from the overflow of CGI. I understand that CGI is necessary in certain scenes but there's no reason at all that practical effects, makeup and animatronics couldn't have been used in this movie. The monsters from the original show looked more believable than the ones in this movie. I guess this won't matter much to children but it's baffling to everyone else. Also the camera work was very unfocused in a couple of scenes. I don't know why this was but it stuck out to me in a scene in the beginning of the movie set in the woods. The movie just isn't memorable. Nothing in the movie really stands out to me. The story's been done before, the characters are nothing new, effects are laughably bad in some scenes (case in point a scene where the Werewolf of Fever Swamp is standing in a grocery store aisle), etc. While the movie certainly isn't bad and I'm very glad they mostly restrained pop-culture references (Aside from a mention to twerking) it's just not memorable. What would have worked better is if they made this movie in an anthology style (like the Twilight Zone movie.) Have the movie be cut into 4 segments adapting old and new Goosebumps stories. I feel like that would have been more memorable.My grade for the movie is a C",Goosebumps
166,tweetlebeetle,"""We're interested in scaring children, but not traumatizing them for life.""",1,22 January 2020,"There is literally no excuse for this other than stupid parents who won't let their children watch anything even the slightest disturbing. This so called, ""family friendly horror film"" consists of nothing but childish filth just slopped into a movie. There is NOTHING remotely creepy I could even find about this. The original Goosebumps, as poorly acted and also not scary as it was, it had moments where my heart started to race. There were moments I found... slightly scary. This is just monsters doing stupid things and people trying to erase them. Now you may be thinking, ""but they're kids they can't handle anything too scary."" Ok first of all shut your overprotective mouth up and secondly they can. Here are some examplesThe Dark Crystal is a dark fantasy movie that contains a scene where characters called The Skeksis watch another of their kind turn to dust and another scene where their slaves, The Podlings, have their souls sent to the Crystal. The Netflix adaptation, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, is even scarier. If you have seen that show, you know that they GO THERE. Like REALLY GO THERE. There are horrific scenes that I don't even want to spoil for you. Thank the people at The Jim Henson Company for not treating kids like fragile pathetic piece of garbage like portrayed here.ANOTHER example is Watership Down, which also has a Netflix adaptation which I have yet to see so I won't talk about it. It contains MURDEROUS BUNNIES that just want to kill every species they see. There's a scene where a rabbit is killed by another rabbit and they show it too. There's terrifying music, a scary narrator, creepily detailed animation, but it still managed to be rated PG. There 2 examples are times when companies didn't treat children like nothing! Unlike this piece of trash.So if you're looking to be surprised by the ""scary"" imadrey, don't get your hopes too high. I absolutely hate what they're doing. There is literally no excuse for this. Even if anything remotely creepy happens, it's sprinkled with filth humor. So if you think that I'm trying to scar children for like, then give the world a big fat favor and screw off. It'll be better with people not like you. Horrible parents raising their children to be soft.",Goosebumps
167,karmap80,"Good for young kids/family, but don't expect much.",6,18 October 2015,"I took my 6 year old son to see this, as he loves anything scary and it's hard to find anything with monsters that is appropriate enough for him to see. He recently started watching the Goosebumps TV show on Netflix, and so he was familiar with the monsters in the movie. One thing you should know: It is not in the least bit scary. It is perfect for a 6-8 year old kid who likes monsters. There is not a single bit of time given to developing a good plot. For instance, Stine's characters come out of the book when it is opened. Why? Because one day they ""became real"". That is the extent of an explanation given for anything. The kids in the movie were great for the material they were given. I would guess that a lot of the movie was made just for the 3D effects, which I did not see since we saw the movie in 2D (my kids won't keep the glasses on.) There were a couple scenes where a scene just kind of showed a monster moving around for a little too long and I knew that it was supposed to be a cool 3D effect. Too obvious. Basically, it was made to be a comedy instead of scary, but unfortunately, it's not really funny at all. I do like Jack Black and all the actors- they just weren't given any good material. To sum it up, your 6 year old will probably love it, but It's just not written well enough for an adult to get much enjoyment from.",Goosebumps
168,troublesometasha13,"""It's time to face my demons""",8,15 November 2016,"Considering I read all the goosebumps books and watched the TV series as a child I must admit I wasn't excited about seeing the movie at all. Most jack black movies make me cringe so just seeing his name in the titles is enough to put me off. However flicking through TV the other day my 12 year old piped up ""let's give it a go"" and to be honest I'm quite glad that we did. The start is a little slow, possibly because the main lads acting is slightly flat, but I do believe it's one of his first movies so I'll cut him some slack. I was interested to see how they would en corporate the books into a movie, I didn't for a moment think that the monsters would emerge from the books! Such a brilliant idea! Jack black played the role of the author very well, it's one of the few movies he's done that I would watch again. He was funny but not his usual over acting, I need to be funny self.The monsters are great, I've seen a lot of reviews complain it wasn't scary, to be fair there wasn't many scary moments for an adult - but I am a horror fan so I'm used to pretty wild movies. However my 12 year old said towards the end ""I've actually got goosebumps"" so I think people need to remember this is a PG rated movie, it's not going to give the average adult nightmares.The only disappointing detail was the story with Hannah. I thought it beautiful that he created a nice character as a friend and it brought a tear to my daughters eye that she too had to disappear into the final book. However the notion of the movie being left open for a sequel made her story no longer make sense. If he was able to leave invisible boy out when the monsters all got trapped why not leave Hannah out too? Especially as he went to the trouble of writing her, her own book to release her again?Other then that one part we quite enjoyed this movie and would recommend any 90's child to see it for the nostalgia effect at least. But please do remember that like me you probably read the book when you were a child, so put you ""child hat"" back on and stop expecting a major horror flick.",Goosebumps
169,crazed_angel911,Missing The Goods,6,15 May 2016,"I had really really high hopes for this movie because I grew up watching goosebumps on television, and I thought this would be a great throwback to that. Also, I am a huge Jack Black fan so I was thinking what could go wrong... well... the fact that they did NOT play the goosebumps theme song, not even in the credits made it definitely lose a few stars. Other than that I thought it was pretty funny and I even jumped a few times. Sadly, I think some of the elements of this story could spook younger audiences, you have been warned. Because nothing sucks more than having to comfort the children while explaining the ventriloquist doll isn't real. Overall, it was decent and brought much nostalgia.",Goosebumps
170,hales156,Great for all ages! Book readers and non alike!,9,18 October 2015,"I grew up reading Goosebumps and could not wait for this film. There were no expectations going into this, knowing it was not an adaptation of one singular novel. It was a fantastic surprise! I'm in my late 20s so I was thrilled to see my favorite monsters on the screen. But even young children would burst out in laughter. Jack Black is one of the greatest character actors of this generation and does not disappoint as Stine. Dylan Minette proved his talent and range as the teenaged protagonist. The film had great flow while offering character development. It's not an Oscar contender by any means, but if you want to see a great family friendly film that makes you laugh or feel you with nostalgia, I recommend Goosebumps!",Goosebumps

172,HeavenlyKing,Great movie with great fictional characters by R.I.Stine,10,21 January 2016,"I really liked this movie, even though i expected something way more exciting. However, I have to mention that those who're saying that they hated this movie, like the 2 reviewers and their voters above my review, are just lying to themselves. These ones are just some miserable little kids who don't get happy with anything, and expect an extraordinary movie in order to like it. The special effects, the scenario, and the acting were pretty good. What else did you want? Monsters in 3d option? Omg... the humanity is f**ked up and gets more and more retarded!!! And by the way, if some of you hated this movie, there are 2 scenarios: Either you shouldn't watch it in the first place, or your IQ is negative.Anyway, i definitely recommend it. In the beginning, it was quite boring, but a few minutes after, the action begins, and it starts to get interesting.It has nice graphics, great fresh cast with the exception of Jack Black of course, and generally, it's such an enjoyable movie. This movie can literally give you any kind of emotion: joy, laughter, terror, agony, hate, love, nostalgia, etc.It has great humorous scenes as well. My favorite actress in this movie was that (a little bit) over-weighted blonde woman. I never saw her in any movie before, but i laughed very much with her. Her lines and her acting were amazing.P.S.: The actress that plays as Hannah, Odeya Rush, looks a lot like Mila Kunis. Their resemblance is unbelievable...",Goosebumps
173,jamdog-47766,A fun kind of scary family film,8,6 August 2016,"Goosebumps is by far one of my favorite movies ever. It's funny, moving and scary in a friendly way. The movie is a perfect example of a great movie. Having read only some of the books it was good for me to discover new creatures. For people who haven't read the books this movie is a great thing to watch. It uses all or all most all of the monsters R.L Stine created in his young adult books. It's fun, actually quite fast paced. There is a few little Easter eggs throughout the film including a cameo from the author of the books R.L Stine at the end of the movie. Although the movie is great I recommend young children don't watch unless sure. The movie has a LOT of monsters some of which can be quite scary and creepy. One of the creepiest monsters is Slappy the dummy. At some points in the movie the screen goes black for a second then Slappy is in a completely different position. Overall the movie is great but be careful with smaller children",Goosebumps

If your like me and grew up watching the Goosebumps TV Series thinking the movie would be the same, then your wrong. The movie has a different twist to the TV series and is more of a stand alone movie with a different format. If you have never watched the TV series you probably would view this movie in a different perspective.In saying that I really enjoyed this movie. It has something I wasn't expecting and has been directed in a clever and funny way. Although it has monsters and other scary creators in it, the movie plays this down to make it ideal for kids to watch while adding humour which kids would understand and laugh at.The acting was reasonable and Jack Black (R.L Stine) brought something else to the table, which for me made it more enjoyable with his usual goofy and wacky personality.",Goosebumps
177,parduet77,Enjoyable Movie But Missed Expectations,6,2 February 2016,"I enjoyed the movie. One of my favorite movies when I was a kid was Monster Squad. Judging by all of the posters and advertisements that is kinda of what I thought I was getting into and mostly what I got. The main problem I have is that there are monster characters on different movie posters that are not really in the movie. If you search engine it you will see posters with a Wolfman, a Scary Pumpkin Head Guy, Aliens and Nosferatu. Seriously I either missed all of those or they were so fast I blinked and they were missed. Mostly centered around the Abominable Snowman, Gnomes and Evil Puppet ( played awesomely by Jack Black).So if it had more variety I would have given it 8 but it did not to me so it gets 6.5",Goosebumps
178,Stylo123,"Lacking in likable characters maybe, but the story itself was enjoyable enough.",3,17 March 2016,"This film, though underwhelming and slightly predictable, was alright, it was fine, it was tolerable.The story is standard for a family film and is riddled with predictable formalities, like ""Mom! You're embarrassing me!"" and ""Oh golly! A girl! I'm a relatable teenage boy, better not embarrass myself in front of her! Doh! I just gone and did! Ya-huck!"" which does deeply offend me to my very core. Teenager moves with his mum to a boring suburb, doesn't fit in at school and makes a best friend who is ""flamboyant"" to say the least. However, little does he know that his neighbour is none other than R.L. Stine, the author of the Goosebumps. Anyway, the teenager hears his daughter scream and immediately thinks ""child abuse!"" like any normal person would, obviously. Then, he BREAKS INTO HIS HOUSE, like any normal person would, obviously, and finds that his daughter is fine and he has just screwed the entire neighbourhood by releasing monsters unto it, via magic books.The dweebs and nerds who read Goosebumps will probably get a kick out of the constant meta jokes and references, as well as recognise the countless amount of monsters that flood the screen.Due to the countless amount of monsters on screen, you could be forgiven for thinking this film was going to suffer from ""The Amazing Spider Man 2"" syndrome with too many villains and not enough focus on any of them. However, this film picks a select few villains and concentrates focus on them, namely The Abominable Snowman, The Werewolf, The Giant Praying Mantis and Slappy, the little wooden bastard that threw the proverbial ""manure"" at the metaphorical ""fan"" to start with. This avoids any poor character development, giving me enough air time to fully familiarise myself with them and hate them all.R.L. Stine is played by Jack Black, who steps out of his ""lovable idiot"" comfort zone which we all know he loves to play mysterious, non-rock orientated character, even though every time he spoke I thought ""Rock. AAAAAAAAHAHAAAAHHAHHHHHAAHHHOOOOHOOOHOOO!!!!""That being said, he plays it alright, better than YOU'D think, you judgemental pillock. There's a definite sinister edge to the character that deteriorates as the film presses on, making him the family-friendly ""lovable loser"" we all know and love.I hate everyone else, though. So much so, that I'm not even going to specify anything about them, because they are not worth it.There are some morally questionable themes near the end of the film which I won't spoil for you now but keep that in mind if you ever go to see it. Okay?Overall, Goosebumps was alright. Lacking in likable characters maybe, but the story itself was enjoyable enough. That being said, it wasn't anything special.",Goosebumps
179,IsaacfromUSA,Absolutely Excellent.,10,19 October 2015,"Teenager Zach Cooper (Dylan Minnette) and his mother Gale (Amy Ryan) move from New York to the small fictional town of Madison, Delaware. His new neighbors are a girl named Hannah (Odeya Rush) and her mysterious author father ""Mr. Shivers"" (Jack Black), who tells him to stay away from his daughter. At his new high school where Gale becomes the new vice-principal, Zach meets and befriends Champ (Ryan Lee), a socially awkward student who is often bullied. One night, Zach hears Shivers and Hannah arguing from his window, followed by Hannah screaming. When he calls the police to investigate, Shivers assures Officer Stevens (Timothy Simons) and Officer Brooks (Amanda Lund) that the scream was from a movie. The officers lecture Zach about wasting the police's time and leave as Gale reprimands Zach.Suspicious of Shivers and fearing Hannah is in danger, Zach anonymously calls Shivers and pretends to be a police officer and tells him to come to the police station for further questioning. Once he is gone, Zach and Champ break into Shivers' house in search of Hannah. They find several manuscripts from the Goosebumps book series, all of which are locked. They unlock The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena, but are confronted by Hannah who assumes they are burglarizing the house. Zach clears up the misunderstanding. But when he accidentally opens the unlocked book, the Abominable Snowman emerges from it and breaks out of the house. In the ensuing chaos, the Night of the Living Dummy manuscript is accidentally unlocked as well. Zach, Champ, and Hannah pursue the Abominable Snowman to a local ice rink where it attacks them, but Shivers appears and sucks it back into the book.On the way home, it is revealed that ""Mr. Shivers"" is actually R.L. Stine, the author of the Goosebumps books. He explains to the three kids that he created the books' monsters when he was a child to cope with severe bullying. However, the monsters became real and he had to lock them in their manuscripts. Returning to the house, Stine and the kids are confronted by Slappy the Dummy (voiced by Jack Black), the villain of Night of the Living Dummy who is angry about being imprisoned. Before Stine can capture him, Slappy burns his own manuscript and flees with the other manuscripts in The Haunted Car. The Lawn Gnomes from Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes are also freed. Zach, Hannah and Champ help Stine smash them into pieces, but each gnome reforms itself making them realize that they cannot be destroyed.Slappy frees the other Goosebumps monsters, destroys their manuscripts, and leads them on a destructive rampage across Madison where the Body Squeezer from Invasion of the Body Squeezers Pt. 1 and 2 freeze the entire police department. Zach suggests to Stine to write a new book that will trap every monster, but he can only do it on a special typewriter which is at the high school. He and the kids are attacked by various Goosebumps monsters on their way to the school including Brent Green the invisible boy (also voiced by Jack Black) from My Best Friend is Invisible and a giant mantis from A Shocker On Shock Street. Will Blake's werewolf form from The Werewolf of Fever Swamp pursues them in an abandoned supermarket. They escape and Zach's aunt Lorraine (Jillian Bell) hits the werewolf with her car. As Stine and the kids continue toward the high school through the cemetery, Zach notices that Hannah glows a ghostly blue in the moonlight. Before he can ask her about it, a zombie bursts out of the ground. After they escape the zombies from Welcome To Dead House and the Graveyard Ghouls from Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls in the cemetery, he privately questions Stine about Hannah's existence. Stine reveals that she is not real, but a Goosebumps character he created after his wife died, though Hannah is unaware of this.At the school, they find the typewriter and Stine starts working on the new book. However, Slappy confronts Stine and breaks his fingers before it can be finished. The monsters attack the school during a fall dance where the giant mantis grabs a person and the swarms of bees from Why I'm Afraid of Bees and the mutant plants from Stay Out of the Basement get into the school. Champ rescues Taylor (Halston Sage) from Will Blake's werewolf form by biting him with his silver teeth fillings and they kiss. The students have to barricade themselves inside to keep the other monsters out.Stine and the kids board a bus and lead the monsters away from the school to an abandoned carnival on the outskirts of town. Slappy catches up with them in the Funhouse and unleashes the giant blob from The Blob That Ate Everyone. While Stine distracts the monsters, Zach finishes the story, but is reluctant to open the book because Hannah will be trapped inside it as well. Hannah reveals that she knew she was not real all along and opens the book. Slappy and the monsters are all sucked into it, and while Zach tries to hold on to her, Hannah accepts her fate and is sucked in as well after they kiss.Some time later, Stine has started working at the high school as an English teacher. After class, Zach asks him if he misses Hannah, but Hannah suddenly reappears. Stine reveals that he wrote her back into existence with another book. She and Zach kiss and leave school together while Stine burns Hannah's manuscript and tosses it in the garbage. As Stine prepares to leave the school, he sees the typewriter typing ""The Invisible Boy's Revenge"" by itself revealing that Brent Green had somehow evaded capture. Stine screams as his hand prints appear on the cabinet's glass.This movie is absolutely excellent for all ages.",Goosebumps
180,maxsloan-37584,"Fun for the family, disappointing for fans.",4,15 October 2015,"In the 90's Goosebumps was a huge hit with kids, leading to its own FOX television show. After the shows success, talks of a film adaption had begun, at one point Tim Burton was even going to direct it. The idea was later scrapped... until 20 years later. Yes, we have finally gotten a film based on R.L Stines smash hit series and before I begin this review I wanna say that I am a huge fan of Goosebumps so these opinions are coming from a fan. Teenager Zach (Dylan Minnette) and his widowed mother have just moved into a new home in Madison, Delaware. Zach, not too excited about moving to a new town, finds a friend in his new neighbor, Hannah (Odeya Rush). But there's something strange about Hannah and her father. After sneaking into their house Zach and his new friend Champ ( Ryan Lee), they accidentally release monsters and ghouls from books written by R.L Stine (Jack Black) Hannah's father. So I expected this to have the same tone as Coraline, not super scary but enough to make kids get, well, GOOSEBUMPS! But it had a lot more of comedy than horror, which I should have expected with Jack Black being in it. The comedy was actually funny in a lot of parts, and many kids were laughing, as was I. But Goosebumps has always been about creeping out kids, which this film failed to do. In no way does this film have any creep factor, even Slappy one of the creepiest characters in the series is reverted to a lame pun- spurting joke of a villain. For fans there really isn't a lot to see. There is maybe 5 or 6 characters from the books, the rest are generic scary creatures like clowns or bugs. The CGI on the creatures are actually pretty good, so was the acting. Some characters like Zach's Mom and Aunt are underdeveloped but it's OK because we don't see a lot of them in the film.In the end, this isn't the greatest thing Goosebumps has done. It has decent acting and visual effects. But Goosebumps isn't supposed to be as comedic as this movie made it. It's supposed to creep out children a little, but this doesn't do that. If your a fan I would skip it, if your a parent, kids will probably like it.",Goosebumps
181,dancingkingpeacefulman,very enjoyable film,7,12 May 2016,Blew my expectations out of the water. The main reason being two words.....Jack Black! He does such a good job and his facial expressions make you laugh through out the whole movie. All and all a good solid lineup when it comes to the cast. Enjoyable action and monsters. It's nice to see the interesting mind of R.L. Stine come to life. The jokes were actually really funny and slippy the dummy was the pun master. I would recommend watching this you'll find yourself laughing and sometimes hiding under the blankets. the beginning was good the middle was good and it ended.......with a twist! And also family friendly.,Goosebumps
182,sarahayre-23320,"just awful, surprise I still watched it all probably because of the monster's.",1,2 October 2016,"goosebumps is just awful, takes after the episodes all in one movie. which is 1 hour 39 mins, Jack blacks worst movie is this and only this. when I watched the trailer I thought i give it a try I never judged the trailer like some people do. I don't like gossebumps because all the monster's in it teaming up just didn't make it very good they were better on their own. The story was not good just not interesting. Then again, the monster's were good and the stunts were good. I'm reviewing this movie because I tried myself on it and did not enjoy it at all. goosebumps is also supposed to be creepy and some scary scenes, they were no scary scenes and creepy scenes at all.The dummy doll slappy was the leader of it all it should not of been this way the monster's were already terroising the town but I do understand why slappy was the leader. The movie was a comedy I didn't laugh at all the sense the humuor was not funny.finally, gosebumps was awful I'm not gonna say I recommend or don't recommend this movie I just hope this review dose help I mean people have give this good and bad reviews.",Goosebumps

186,ViolinsinVideogames90,"If you liked the books, you'll approve of this.",9,5 July 2020,"This movie pays great homage to one of the most well known spooky mystery book series of the 90s. The graphics are well done (especially Slappy who actually looks like an evil ventriloquist dummy and not whatever that thing was on the Saturday morning TV show). Furthermore, they wove it all into a Jumanji-esque plot that worked well. This movie also proved what a versatile actor Jack Black is as he makes a very believable portrayal of a reclusive loner/mystery writer that shuts the public out so they don't discover/mishandle his dark secret.",Goosebumps
187,tasinbc,Total Waste of time,3,25 April 2016,"The story was good but the making and direction is crap. The story progress is very clumsy. There are others shortcomings which make this brilliant concept a horrible amateur work. the reasons will be.1. the acting is horrible and inconsistent. sometimes they are funny, sometimes they are serious without any reason, sometimes they are very emotional in a very bad time. And everyone in this story is stupid. literally everyone, except the Hannah and Sloppy. the principle, the mom, the aunt, our hero, his idiot friend, specially the cops they all are bunch of idiots.2. our Hero makes friendship with the geek boy in the first day of school.3. R.L. Stine keeps the deadly books in a shelf for display.4. locked book opens up without any key, just by dropping off.5. the art direction, background score, expressions, and voice acting makes you confused whether its a fantasy comedy or real horror film. Sometimes its serious, sometimes it tries to be funny.6. our hero and his buddy fall in love in a really weird time.7. when the students tried to protect the school from invasion they put up worthless barricade without locking doors.8. we don't know how aunt Lorraine and R.L. Stine fell in serious love, how the frozen people were rescued.9. at first it seems that R.L. Stine has the power of creating real monsters, then we come to know that actually the typewriter has the power, R.L. Stine is meaningless. and also the very powerful typewriter is also on display so that horrible things can happen very easily.10. the portion where our hero and R.L. Stine talk about the reality about Hannah, the acting and emotions are totally out of the context. the tried get emotional which is actually became annoying.11. at beginning we came to know that there is a matter of range for sucking the monsters back in the book, but at the end we learn that range doesn't matter.12. R.L. Stine can't write with broken fingers but he can drive.I don't understand how this film got so much high rating in Rotten tomatoes.",Goosebumps

189,alanhong-52964,"Another ""Jumanji""",6,6 November 2015,"My title tells it all. Just more teeth, bigger, and more scary, according to J. World....Remember everything becomes real from Jumanji, and it is the same that starts from a house. Even though one is a board game, and the other is story books, they are all the same universe.Besides, this movie uses a lot of movie references, movie fans should like it (At least one obviously used Jack Black's movie). I personally think the author and the doll villain refers to Batman and Joker.Of course, the twist is fine. For some audiences, it may be unpredictable. It carries a question: the book is a lie but the story is true, how would you take that?",Goosebumps
190,towniecmb12,7.5 out of 10,7,4 April 2016,"Goosebumps was a fun family film with some really funny moments and a great all around cast! Fun for all ages! It wont win any Oscars, but it will definitely make your yearly Halloween movie list! Jack Black is so into the role that you cant help, but smile. 2015's version of Monster Squad. Not a perfect movie, yet I liked a lot of what this had to offer. A little distracting how much the female lead looks like Mila Kunis, but hey you'll get over it. Some of the scenes with Slappy the dummy will have you giggling and being creeped out all at the same time. I was surprised to see Danny Elfman was responsible for the score...It was a different sound from him.",Goosebumps

And I can say it wasn't bad, I mean I wasn't boring. Unfortunately some beasts I didn't know but still it was interesting for me. I guess it can be more enjoyable for younger generation or for who had read story when was child. And about visual it was good, nice animations, and acting was fine. I just stuck in some logic stuffs which wasn't working right (like why invisible boy still was there) but I think it is some nonsense to think about when you are watching such a kind of movie. It is not in my top movies but I really would like to watch it with my nephews.",Goosebumps
192,dragonsblood23,Gave me Goosebumps,8,16 October 2015,"I found the movie quite interesting. Loved how the creatures aren't just all CGI and had some puppetry. Slappy in the movie was a great villain and the other monsters work also. How the books work were a brilliant idea. Unforuntley there was some bad stuff like the side character, Champ, was unnecessary and not funny and the ending was very clichéd.I did like tho how RL Stine pulled a Stan Lee and cameoed as Mr. Black of a Drama Class (I see what they did there :P). Other then Champ, the acting was good, I especially enjoyed Jack Black. Its a fun movie to watch on Halloween if you want to see a good film. Goosebumps is like if Gremlins and Jumanji combined and it worked out fine. I give this an 8/10. Happy Halloween and hopefully you'll see this movie.",Goosebumps
193,kellycrocker63,"decent cgi, but dry and stale humor that ruined the movie for me",5,13 May 2016,"The plot line was good, the cgi was pretty good as well. Champ was a bit annoying throughout the movie to me with his constant whining and unnecessary clinging and causing the movie to get slower because he grabbing on people during a few scenes. The movie is good, the monster looked better than they did on the TV series. But I wouldn't watch this movie a second time. I rated this a 5 because of some of annoying characters, some dialog they could of added to some scenes to make them better instead of a beginner trying to rush through a scene quickly to get to the climax and leaving stuff they should of added. Also the humor was a huge bummer for it. The Humor was stale and bad. I know nothing will be perfect, but the TV series never had that stale humor before. But the reasoning for it's stale humor is because of today's youth. it tried to match today's youth by having the characters at the wrong times mention famous stuff like oh gotta twerk, oh gotta get this on intsagram, or youtube. Rule 101 don't do that. When you add the bad parts of today's youth like twerking as a form of humor to make better for now days audience that's like a slap in the face the fans that actually seen or read your books, and the maturer audiene.",Goosebumps

Stine wrote one more book just so he could bring Hannah back. I think the ending was so funny because when Invisible Boy came back was going to get revenge on R.L. Stine. I am going to buy this movie when it come out onto DVD. 10 thumbs up. My favorite part was in the car going to the school when Invisible Boy slapped Champ. I have a piece of advice for Champ, don't tell a girl you didn't brush you're teeth. LOL. I hope they make another movie but this time about when he was younger.

Jack Black was good in a subdued role. The story was solid. The C.G.I. was used , when necessary . I found what I thought was going to be the most obnoxious character, the kid with the teeth, was not so bad too. The movie also had an some what interesting mystery in many ways. There was no unnecessary violence except maybe against a werewolf or two. The film was definitely not a award winning horror, drama, winner, but it was a good popcorn companion. The scares in the movie fall upon the action adventure kind also, so it is pretty safe for the young ones.",Goosebumps
196,jaimeshaw,"Great, but quite slow on the uptake!",8,14 February 2016,"Goosebumps is a fairly even paced film packed with twists and turns as you delve deeper into the story. Jack Black played a great part in the film as R.L Stine and fit the part perfectly; in short his rendering of tortured eccentric and reclusive victim of his own twisted creations was delivered with sincerity and dynamic comedy gusto.Zacharias ""Zach"",the main character, has a sense of curiosity about him. He is a evenly- balanced character.Champion ""Champ"" is a extremely humorous character with subtle characteristics.Hannah is R.L Stine's daughter. Her acting was great, her relationship with Zach was eased into the film mellifluously.The films graphical content was high quality. The CGI in the film was integrated expertly into the film. Overall it was a lovely representation of the extensive limits of graphics in the technical world we live in today.With it's scary and comedic elements i would definitely recommend it to anybody with a wild imagination.",Goosebumps

But that's completely false. I'm honestly pleased to say that Goosebumps did a great job as a mass film; moreover, it indicates the issue of the isolated person - as it's the main factor of all problems.Keeping himself isolated for a long time, Stine finally released his monsters, which are the symbols of all troubles in his heart, to the real world. He got no friends and no communities, then he became introverted. The dark side turned into fictions and the beginning of thee story.At the dawn, it seems to be bored and soporific, yet when the monsters arrive, that takes the film more interesting. Special graphic of monsters are well-designed, not that good but not bad. There are some flat jokes but it's acceptable.To summarize, this is a better-than-expected movie. I'm not surprised now with its gross income.",Goosebumps
202,aaron2611,Wow this is quite scary for kids but still a great movie,8,27 January 2016,"Now I wouldn't normally review a movie but after watching a UK preview I was quite surprised it was passed as a PG as some of the monsters in this are quite scary. I don't think younger kids (under 10) are going to thank you for giving them dreams which will make them wake up in sweats anytime soon! But apart from that it is a fun movie with lots of action but with a mediocre story to it (let's be honest the trailer tells you the whole story!) Lovely special FX in this movie and they really have pulled out all the stops on some of the monster characters. Although this movie stars Jack Black it isn't really about him at all as his performance is 5 out of 10. It's all about the main baddie and he is a really creepy looking ""thing"" P.S. Clown phobia kids won't be happy!",Goosebumps

It was not as good as I hoped for and Jack Black really ruined it for me. The constant back and forth between a normal accent and a cheesy put on one really annoyed me.. It took what should have and could have been a great movie but it just fell short for me personally. I also was not a fan of the mish mash of stories and monsters all rolled into one story..There are about a million other actors who could have done it much better than Black, sorry to say!All in all, it was not a bad movie.. but it could have been a lot better!",Goosebumps

The acting was pretty good, second example beside Berny of Jack Black showing that he has skills in acting. I like the main character, he is not a dumb ass, and seams to be fairly with it. The really put a lot into the CGI budget, cause all of the monster look real and not out of place with the surrounding environment.I don't like how the film depicts R.L. Stein as this crazy angry guy, since he in real life seam pretty quiet if not a little awkward. Over all the movie as a whole was well executed, there was balance of types scene that all flowed together seamlessly to make the appearance of one coherent plot line. All and all my initial fears that this movie was going to smear on Goosebumps good rep has pretty much been extinguished.",Goosebumps

Something which was not only unadulterated but contained enough joy in it to remind one of their child hood(albeit they were from the 90's era).I enjoyed the way the story was woven around R.L.Stein's monsters. As a child when I stayed in the States for a year I would indulge myself in the ""Goosebumps"" books. I was not expecting a visual extravaganza but nonetheless I expected this movie to be a heart warming, child friendly rendezvous with scary monsters who were just right enough to scare a child but in a harmless way which was both fun and entertaining.Jack Black helps in retaining the core of the movie with this goofy and wacky self. I hardly found a boring minute in the film and my wife thoroughly enjoyed it as well.I would rate it 8 stars and recommend anyone to see it. Its a good feature with all the essential ingredients thrown in it.",Goosebumps
206,irvinzmartinez,"Nothing Special, Not To Say There is No Special in It",6,27 October 2015,"I found this film to be something of a letdown. Sony is trying to cash in on the nostalgia craze among millennials, but completely missed the mark in one of the most pitiful ways. How? No use of the original theme song of the Goosebumps television series! I can only imagine that Sony could not secure the rights. I'd like to believe that they would not commit such a blunder purposefully.Anyway, about the movie...its on the ""meh"" side of OK. This film takes the 90's book and television series that was at many times diverting in the themes it explored and turns it into ""not another coming-of-age story."" The leads, Zach and Hannah, are a bland match made in heaven. The film follows the pair as they (along with Jack Black's Stine and Ryan Lee's Champ) attempt to stop the Goosebumps monsters by trapping them back in their individual books.The computer graphics used to render the monsters and their transitions from ink to murderous demons from hell are very impressive. The rest of the sets and props prepared for the film (especially Slappy's redesign) take the bite out of what made the television series so enjoyable. This film might have gone tumbling down the chute of obscurity had it not been for the performances of Lee and Black. Their performances are hilarious and it is a laugh riot whenever they are on screen.This film could have a held a special, nostalgic place in my heart. Instead, it will hereon serve as a cautionary piece for directors everywhere about the dangers of making your sidekick and supporting characters more likable and enjoyable than your main characters.",Goosebumps

This all happened because ""Slappy"" supposedly knocked down all of the cell phone towers.Scene after scene of nonsense.Ridiculous Movie.Get Real, save money and wait until you see it on DVD.",Goosebumps

Stine daughter who is Hannah. There is a short romantic scene while they try to escape from the monsters which is created by R.L. Stine with no intention. They are a big group of the students also helping them to kill the monster as well. I don't want to pause the movie while I'm watching this movie.

209,filmcracker442,Goosebumps Review,8,19 December 2015,Hello this is my Goosebumps review ( WARNING SPOILERS ) First of all i thought Goosebumps is going to be another bad movie and didn't thought about it and when it first came out i wasn't very excited.The second thing is the actors and how they performed:Jack Black- Very good comedian in my opinion but this was one of the only movies where i have seen Jack Black acting like this.Dylan Minnette- He's going to be a star in not so far future but the acting in Goosebumps left me kinda gold about him. Like he didn't acted bad but just wasn't anything special eitherAnd now the third part is the Story and the most important thing :Definitely the story was great 8/10. Movie starts with a boy moving to a new house and meeting that girl who i think he falls in love with with and eye blink and then hes worried that shes father might have done something to her then he sneaks into their house and opens one book but I'm not going to tell the whole story but it was kinda interesting though.And now the grand finale my ratings :Actors: 7/10 just they could have changed some of the characters like JB Cinematography: 9/10 nothing to complain about 3D effects: 8/10 sorry haven't seen in 3D but based on other reviews Story: 8/10 Sorry was great and the plot twists that made it great Movie: Movie will take total 8/10 in my opinion,Goosebumps

I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. I took my 9 year old knowing that she wouldn't wet her pants or leave in tears. I don't think that the negative ratings based on ""campy script"" and ""see through"" plot are fair. This was targeted as a children's movie that adults would experience nostalgia over. That's what it was. The casting director threw Jack Black in there knowing he wouldn't disappoint those of us who are old enough to have read the books growing up. I unapologetically loved this movie.",Goosebumps
211,SecondWood,A relaxing movie for someone feels boring,6,12 February 2016,"I went to watch this movie out of bore, and finally found that it is beyond my expectation. The story is in old style: flat beginning, attractive middle and happy ending. You know what it will be in the end at the first minute of the movie. Even so, there are still some bright spots in this movie. The story is quite straightforward and you don't have to think during the movie. The only thing you need to do is to keep eating snacks. The director does create a creepy atmosphere to the monsters. When it came to Slappy, I did feel goosebumps at my back. And the movie also presented various monsters to the audiences, though most of them have few portion. In a nutshell, this movie is somehow similar to the Pixels.",Goosebumps
212,spaloon,"a fun movie, but...",7,2 February 2016,"as a whole, I really enjoyed the movie. the monsters were top-notch and very well animated! the plot was fun and the characters had a lot of humor, and there were a lot of jokes i definitely appreciated. really, the only thing i found wrong with the movie were how the relationships were written. unfortunately they're such an integral part to the movie that they definitely drag it down...all of the romantic relationships are too fast paced. i guess i had to expect that in a movie starring a boy and a girl that theyd end up together, but at the same time i was at least hoping not to be presented with something so... i don't know, lackluster? the movie is constantly shoving the relationships in your face. every seen female character with speaking lines gets into a relationship at some point- a boy and girl literally have 2 minutes of screen time together before they appear in a relationship. the movie is rampant with this.of course, as a mainstream media movie its to be expected. its just a shame in a movie that did so well on every other front.just go in with low expectations for character interactions that aren't funny and you'll be fine.",Goosebumps
213,candycane-94258,Goosebumps Short Review,6,23 June 2016,"First off let me say this. I have been a fan of R.L Stine's Goosebumps franchise since I was in the fourth grade. I read some of the books, I watched the TV series, and now I've had the joy of watching this movie on my birthday (October 18th), where I turned twenty-one, which was the perfect ending of my childhood. Goosebumps is a PG, 3D live-action/computer-animated horror comedy, and was released on October 16th , 2015. After Zach Cooper, portrayed by Dylan Minnette, moved from New York, to Delaware with his mom, they move in next door to an man named ""Mr.Shivers"", portrayed by comedic actor Jack Black, and his daughter Hannah, portrayed by Odeya Rush. After befriending Hannah, Zach hears a scream coming from next door and fears that Hannah is in danger staying with her dad. After him and his new friend from school Champ, portrayed by Ryan Lee, try to do some investigating at ""Mr. Shivers"" house, but what they find is something neither of them was expecting. They end up finding ""Mr. Shivers"" office that includes manuscripts of Goosebumps books, but find they are locked. Zach finds a key and decides to unlock it and once he does Hannah comes in and is shocked to find Zach there and sees that he has unlocked one of the books ""The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena"". Zach then opens it, which was a big mistake because he ends up unleashing the Abominable Snowman. Once he is released he goes on rampage knocking over books and later going through town. After Hannah goes after him, Zach and Champ follow her, but unknown to them is a book that has been unlocked. After ""Mr. Shivers"" find them and end up capturing the Abominable Snowman by trapping him back in the book. It is revealed that ""Mr. Shivers"" is actually R.L.Stein. Once they return back to Mr, Stein's house they find out that book that was open was ""Night of the Living Dummy"". Yes for all you Goosebumps fans out there. SLAPPY IS BACK!!!! Slappy ends up releasing all the other monsters from their books and now it's up to R.L. Stein, Hannah, Zach, and Champ to chase all the monsters and place them back in their right books. Overall this movie had some good CGI, had a solid plot, had a fresh young cast, and provided some shocking twists. Including a surprise cameo appearance, so be on the lookout. At times some of the jokes were kind of cheesy, but I'm sure children will find that hilarious. What I loved most was how it was still classic Goosebumps. It doesn't matter if you're a child, teen, young adult, adult, or elder. If you were a fan of the book series or even the TV series, which ran during 1995-1998, then you are sure to enjoy this movie.",Goosebumps
214,orfordprimary,Great Graphics and an awesome film!,9,27 June 2016,This is a review written by a 12 year old grade 6 student from Australia.R.L.Stine has written many books and a boy named Zach Cooper and his mate Champ discover that when the original copies of the R.L.Stine books are opened the monsters from the books come to life. This sets off an adventure to save the town from all the escaped monsters.well: The graphic for the monsters are supreme and its almost impossible to predict what comes next. It was great to see the characters from the books that I love come to live in a thrilling movie. I absolutely love this movie which is why I rate it 9 star.,Goosebumps

217,mitchellj-1,Just okay,5,24 October 2015,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but unfortunately left somewhat disappointed. My son loved Stine and at 16, I thought he would enjoy the movie, but his reaction was somewhat mediocre as well. I think the age range is younger; like maybe 8-12 yr old. The writing isn't bad, but is very predictable. The acting is just okay and it almost became a game to see what Jack Black's next dialect would be. Ryan Lee was our favorite character; this kid has some comedic talent and good acting chops. There are many recognizable faces in the movie and they are likable characters.The special effects were good; not Guardians of the Galaxy good, but good. So, a cute film and good for younger kids, but don't set your expectations too high.",Goosebumps
