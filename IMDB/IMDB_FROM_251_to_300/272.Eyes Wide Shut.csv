0,MartinHafer,"I know this makes me a heretic, but this film should have had at least half an hour trimmed.",7,10 August 2010,"It's amazing that a film this long and drawn out would actually leave so much unsaid and unclear. What's also amazing is that although I am a huge cinemaniac, I am willing to dare to say that the god of cinema snobs, Stanley Kubrick, made a film that was far from perfect. The bottom line is that although the plot was very interesting, the film was simply too low energy, too long and too over-stylized.I must stop to make a horrible confession. Despite having now done over 9000 reviews for IMDb, I have very, very mixed feelings about Kubrick's films and the following are my insane opinions about many of his more famous films. Some are masterpieces--such as ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Paths of Glory"" and ""The Killing"". Others, exceptional but flawed--""Spartacus"" went on too long and should have ended at the 'I am Spartacus' scene (then it would have been perfect). Others, way, way, way overrated--""2001"" is is definitely so. And others are so long and dull it boggles the mind--""Barry Lyndon"" made we want to scream it moved so slowly.As for ""Eyes Wide Shut"", it is far from Kubrick's best work and it is painfully slow...but it does merit watching. The basic story idea is, at times, intriguing. There is a lot to like. But, the film shows a certain painfully obsessive quality--a need to show EVERYTHING--every emotion, every grimace...almost every breath! Considering that Mr. Kubrick was well-known for his OCD-like qualities (often shooting scenes again and again and again as well as going months or years past deadlines), this isn't too surprising. Plus, by the time he made the film he was a bit of a film guru--and adored so much that no one would dare question why this movie clocks in at almost 168 minutes--whereas another director might complete the film in less than 120.There is also one thing that boggled my mind about the movie. Although the film should have received an NC-17 rating (again, I assume this was withheld because it was a Kubrick film), even with gobs of full-frontal nudity, it managed to make sex boring! The way some of the sex scenes were so over-choreographed (especially at the party at the mansion where Cruise was the interloper) made me wish that despite the gorgeous women that they'd just cut much of it. As a result, while it's not a film I'd rush to show a teenager, it's almost sanitary enough that you could.As far as the performances go, the best in the film was by Sidney Pollack. Unlike most everyone else in the film, he actually had some energy--like he was the only one awake among a half-asleep cast. I sure wanted to see more acting like this--and perhaps, in a way, Pollack was directing himself a bit.So far, it really sounds like I disliked the film, though this isn't exactly true--I mostly just disliked the way it was directed (ahhh....I must be a heretic). As for the extremely sexy story, some of it was great. I liked how the film explored what might happen if couples are too open about their sexual fantasies and the irreparable harm it can cause. I liked the idea of a secret society made up of the rich and powerful. I liked the way that you never knew exactly whether or not Cruise might die. But, I also think I've seen much of this done better in John Frankenheimer's ""Seconds"". I know that Frankenheimer is a very, very well-respected director but know few would say he was better than Kubrick--but in this particular case I think he did a better job mostly because his film was more direct, less self-indulgent and lacked the occasionally annoying soundtrack. The bottom line is that I liked the film but far from loved it. And, for the most part, that was the reaction to the film when it debuted. Aside from the Kubrick worshipers, most seem to feel it was one of his lesser films.Worth seeing but think three or four times about having your kids watch it!",Eyes Wide Shut
1,TheLittleSongbird,Kubrick's swansong his most underrated?,8,17 June 2011,"In my opinion, I think it is. Not his best mind you, I personally would put 2001, Clockwork Orange, Dr Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket and Barry Lyndon over Eyes Wide Shut, but while I haven't seen it in quite some time and have been meaning to revisit it I remember not being particularly impressed with Fear and Desire.I like and respect Kubrick a lot. He is a great and influential director who is of great interest to me, and his skill for directing is in full evidence here. I can understand why people mayn't like Eyes Wide Shut, it is a very lengthy film and slow, but I also find it interesting and find it Kubrick's most underrated. I will admit the first two times I saw it I didn't like it, but I have seen it another three times and each time it gets better.Like all of Kubrick's movies Eyes Wide Shut is beautifully made and edited, and has a wonderful soundtrack consisting of mostly pre-existing music with Musica Ricacarta by Ligeti standing out the most. The screenplay is mostly very good and the story is interesting. Much has been said of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, either good or bad. In my view Cruise is good, for me it is one of his better performances, but Kidman is just terrific and is memorable in every scene she's in.In conclusion, interesting and for me Kubrick's most underrated film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Eyes Wide Shut
2,Leofwine_draca,"Way too long, but it's a fitting swansong for Kubrick",7,10 July 2016,"Kubrick's final film turns out to be both disappointing and spellbinding, but thankfully the spellbinding part far outweighs the disappointing bit. Despite the massive hype, many critics were unkind to this film, labelling it wishy-washy and insubstantial. While I agree that it is definitely flawed, there are some excellent scenes in the film which rival those of any creepy horror film.While the film starts off poorly, it does get better, let me assure you. Kubrick almost deliberately seems to be trying to push the viewer away, challenging him by drawing out unimportant scenes and pushing them into our faces. I do agree that the film is far, far too long, the two hour and a half length is just over the top, and I'm sure that it could have been cut down half an hour to a greater effect. Also, the widely publicised 'erotic' content is not actually there; although the film is based around sex, there is very little actual sex on show, and Cruise doesn't even sleep with anybody, apart from his wife. There is lots of nudity on full view, but no more than you'd see on TV, so it's not really very shocking.The film has an interesting cast, with Tom Cruise being an agreeable focus point from the film; it's not hard to imagine that he can be irresistible to every person he meets, male or female. Nicole Kidman actually appears only at the beginning and the end of the film to provide some antagonistic argument, and also to shed her clothes (no surprise there). The rest of the cast all put in believable, immaculate performances, but the real star here is Stanley Kubrick. Having made only a handful of films in his career, this epic was to be his swansong, and the magic that made 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and THE SHINING such good films is still here, you just have to dig to see it.The best moments in the film are when Cruise visits the orgy. The sight of the robed, masked figures is genuinely spooky and unsettling, especially when they discover Cruise to be an outsider and begin to threaten him. These scenes are pure horror and very effective, as is another moment where Cruise is followed down the street by a faceless man. In fact, I liked the whole of Cruise's journey through the night and his discovery of the consequences the next day, just not the Cruise/Kidman bits which surrounded it. The film is bolstered by an eerily effective soundtrack, one piece of music being played on piano sticking in the mind. While it is overused, it's still quite chilling. EYES WIDE SHUT may be no masterpiece and it may take some sitting through, but there are some great bits to enjoy and altogether it serves as a fitting swansong to Kubrick. Recommended.",Eyes Wide Shut
3,SnoopyStyle,meandering cold movie,6,25 June 2015,"Upper class New York couple Alice (Nicole Kidman) and Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) seems to have it all with their girl. They go to his rich patient Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack)'s party where he ends up treating an overdose. His medical school mate Nick Nightingale gives him a password to a special party. He meets prostitute Domino. Milich and his sexualized daughter rents him the costume. He is confronted at the mansion and is kicked out. He becomes obsessed with getting back into the secret society.There is no arguing that Stanley Kubrick makes good looking films. Looking back, there is something meta about Kidman and Cruise's crumpling marriage both on and off the screen. There is a fascination with this movie like slipping a small glimpse into their real lives. However I don't like the meandering nature of the plot and the disconnected nature of these characters. I don't care about any of the characters and I don't find their relationship compelling. The numerous naked beautiful women actually becomes numbing especially since most of them are wearing masks. They might as well be mannequins. Other than Leelee Sobieski and Nicole, none of the female characters are that interesting.",Eyes Wide Shut
4,Prismark10,Eyes Wide Shut,5,9 July 2016,"Eyes Wide Shut was Stanley Kubrick's final film. He died before the film's wide release. The film was in production for over a year requiring various re-shoots. It starred the then husband and wife team of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.Dr Bill Harford (Cruise) is a successful young doctor with his own practice, beautiful wife, young daughter and a swanky apartment in Manhattan.After attending a lavish party where Bill flirted a bit and later smoking some pot in their apartment. His wife Alice (Kidman) tells him that she once fantasised leaving him for a sexy sailor. This rocks Bill as he now keeps imagining his wife having sex with the sailor.This sets Bill on a road to strange encounters where he lets his inhibitions drop and walk the wild side of life. He meets a woman that is a hooker, a bereaved daughter lunges and kisses him. He goes to a fancy dress shop where the owner's nubile daughter gives him the come on. Bill gets an old medical school friend, now a piano player to reveal to him the location of a place where wild sex parties take place.However Bill gets caught out as an interloper in the sex orgy and realises that he might have put himself in danger, especially when a prostitute in the orgy turns up dead and his piano playing friend disappears.Bill is spurred on to confess to his wife about the dark night of his soul and his various encounters, none of which ever lead to sex.The film is beautifully filmed in a Christmas setting that allows for a lot of festive themed lights. The film was shot in London as Kubrick who having settled in Britain never left the country.Despite building a typical Greenwich Village street at Pinewood Studios it looked unauthentic.There is nothing in this movie to suggest why it took so long to shoot the film. At its heart it is just an adult drama with erotic leanings and comic absurdities.Now I know he was not known as 'One Take Kubrick' but really taking over a year to shoot the film was taking the biscuit. I once read a discussion and I think it has some validity that the reason Kubrick took so many takes was he was hoping for some kind of serendipity. A chance magical intervention that would suddenly occur which would elevate one shot from dozens of other similar ones and critics would acclaim Kubrick as some kind of wizard.During the production two actors were replaced. Sydney Pollack replaced Harvey Keitel as Ziegler the gregarious and libertine party host. Pollack was an actor turned Oscar winning director who specialised in making cameo appearances such as the startled agent in Tootsie and the shocked doctor in Death Becomes Her.Pollack also directed Cruise in The Firm. Pollack was right on the money as Ziegler the concerned friend but also a man with a seedy underbelly.Jennifer Jason Leigh was replaced by Marie Richardson as Marion the bereaved daughter who impulsively kisses Bill.The notorious orgy starts out as some kind of Roger Corman-like masked ball from The Masque of the Red Death with some kind of semi satanic rituals before descending into some laughable softcore sex scenes. Some of the over enthusiastic jiggling we get to see, well let us say the man would be slipping out a lot.The women Kubrick hired for the sex party look rather fetching with their thongs and bare breasts. Kudos to the casting director.Cruise's character is very passive with all that is going on around him including the kinkiness. He might had a sharp punch in the gut from his wife's careless words but Cruise does not reflect this. This must a be a directorial choice as Cruise is a lot better and a more expressive actor than say Matthew Modine or Ryan O'Neil that Kubrick had cast in his previous movies.The whole story is too thin and stretched out for a 160 minutes run time. The film is leisurely paced. At least Kubrick pierced the mundane setting with sudden slapstick such as the escapades of the Fancy Dress Shop owner and his daughter.Ultimately the film is about two married people who took each other for granted and failed to appreciate each other. Just look at Alice at the beginning who is peeing in the bathroom as Bill walks in and does not flinch.At the first party thrown by Ziegler, she gets propositioned by an older man and she flirts back while Bill in turn is being playful to two English ladies which Alice sees but does nothing about.Kubrick made fewer films as he got older. Eyes Wide Shut was his first film since 1987. Cruise and Kidman were prepared to put their successful film careers on hold to work for an auteur knowing that they could spend months making the film. It is just a shame that Kubrick went out on a whimper.",Eyes Wide Shut
5,classicsoncall,"""...I was ready to give up everything.""",8,20 May 2018,"This is the kind of movie that I'll almost immediately head on over to the IMDb FAQ page after watching to see if there's anything offered that might help with interpreting the picture. But as is often the case with complex stories, there are multiple levels of interpretation one might apply to the events that occur on a bizarre night during which Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) tries to come to terms with his wife's (Nicole Kidman) hint of a marital infidelity. There's something to be said about the idea that Harford's participation at the masquerade party was all part of a dreamscape, and that it was only his fevered imagination coming up with all the strange occurrences he experienced after leaving his wife at their apartment. How else for example, would Masked Woman #1 have been able to determine that Harford's life was in great danger by attending, and that he should leave immediately? Or consider the sudden appearance of Harford's own mask on his bed pillow next to Alice (Kidman). If it were all a dream, there's no reason to question the improbabilities because one's own subconscious mind is making it all up. Also contributing to the idea that most of this was all a dream was Harford's own reaction to events occurring around him, as most of what he experienced summoned very little emotional response. While watching though, I didn't get the sense that Harford was dreaming. Having become obsessed over his wife's admission, it felt that he was out for some semblance of revenge against her for even thinking of being unfaithful. He further added to his own paranoia by envisioning his wife in bed with the mythical Navy military man. The entire sequence at the party estate was bizarrely surreal and had me mesmerized. It had the appearance of some sort of black mass ritual and felt demonic in it's intensity. The use of a password and the presence of the blindfolded piano player Nick (Todd Field) only added to the mystery of Harford's experience. Regarding the principals, I don't think Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman ever looked more appealing. As a glamorous couple they rivaled Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" and the fact that they were married while making this picture suggests they were willing to lay it all on the line for their craft. I was put off by Kidman's character while at the Ziegler (Sidney Pollack) party while dancing with Szavost (Sky Dumont), and she only added to the perception of being a witch with a capital 'B' back at their apartment. The idea that their marriage was hitting the skids would be something of an understatement, though Harford's response went a bit beyond the pale. Perhaps another viewing of the film would be in order to further test some of the ideas presented by other critics, though one's first impression of a surreal adventure needs some time to percolate. I will revisit the film again when the time is right.",Eyes Wide Shut
6,gavin6942,Kubrick In His Final Days,8,30 March 2015,"A New York City doctor (Tom Cruise), who is married to an art curator (Nicole Kidman), pushes himself on a harrowing and dangerous night-long odyssey of sexual and moral discovery after his wife admits that she once almost cheated on him.At this point (2015), I have seen all of Kubrick's work and love most of it. But ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was one of my earlier Kubrick excursions, following the cult classics. At the time, responses seemed to be mixed. While I instantly loved it, others found it to be hard to handle.If anything, my opinion over the last fifteen years has only solidified this as being among Kubrick's best. We start out with some intrigue, then get into a light philosophical conversation about infidelity... before going head-on into a conspiracy theory that somehow still makes sense. This is a grand adventure, much larger in scale than anything else he had done. And he pulls it off brilliantly.",Eyes Wide Shut
7,lee_eisenberg,Why did Stanley Kubrick have to end like this?!,4,16 April 2006,"Before ""Eyes Wide Shut"" came out, there was a lot of hype about it, given that Stanley Kubrick had died before the release, and the possibility that stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman might get EXTREMELY intimate in some scene or another.WHAT A LETDOWN!!!!!!!!! The movie was boring at best. So let's say for a minute that it was talking about sexual fantasies. If so, then they only focused on male sexual fantasies. Kubrick should have known better.It wasn't until a took a film class that I even figured out how to have a serious discussion about the movie: there's a lot of duality. There are two Eastern Europeans (a Hungarian and a Serb)*, Tom Cruise twice goes to the Serb (and the first time, he gets angry at his daughter for having sex, but later it looks like he's pimping her), Tom Cruise twice goes to the strange house, and some other things. Also, the Bugs Bunny cartoon that they watch in one scene functions in sort of the same way that the Road Runner cartoon in ""The Shining"" does.In an interview, Martin Scorsese said that this movie almost seems to be about New York in a dreamlike state. Either way, it still feels like it's dragging. A lousy end for the director who gave us ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""2001"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining"".*Presumably, this could be a remnant of ""Traumnovelle"", the novel on which the movie was based. The novel was written by an Austrian person in the 1920s. As the Austro-Hungarian Empire had just broken up, there may have been a number of people in Austria from throughout that empire, including Hungarians and Serbs.",Eyes Wide Shut
8,jboothmillard,Eyes Wide Shut,4,14 July 2005,"This was director Stanley Kubrick's last film before his death, and unfortunately, it is not one of his best. Basically, Tom Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford and Nicole Kidman plays his wife, Alice. They are a troubled couple that do not have a lot of passion in themselves. One night Alice tells Bill she is going to bed, and he takes this opportunity to have a night to himself. In this night, he almost has sex with a prostitute, and then he buys a mask, black cloak with hood and tuxedo to go to a large house of (invited) men and women (wearing masks) shagging all over. Those are pretty much the highlights for this almost confusing and not very exciting film. Also starring Sydney Pollack as Victor Ziegler, Marie Richardson as Marion Nathanson, Rade Serbedzija as Milich, Todd Field as Nick Nightingale, Vinessa Shaw as Domino, GoldenEye's Alan Cumming as Desk clerk and Leelee Sobieski as Milich's daughter. The two biggest problems I have are there is not a lot of explanation for certain things, and every moment was too slow, dragging the film on. The critics say it is a must see, but I'll let other people decide that, I personally wouldn't recommend it as a Kubrick masterpiece. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Jocelyn Pook, and it won the Venice Film Festival Filmcritica ""Bastone Bianco"" Award for Kubrick. Nicole Kidman was number 21, and Tom Cruise number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Cruise was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Okay!",Eyes Wide Shut
9,ccthemovieman-1,Pitiful Way For Kubrick To Finish,1,26 August 2007,"I have to concur with a lot of people here about being a fan of Stanley Kubrick's films....and being so disappointed with this effort. I mean, come on: what was this garbage? All the hype beforehand didn't help, along with Kubrick's reputation, so to sit through two-and-- a--half hours of this nonsense was ridiculous.Frankly, I don't know one person in real-life who liked this movie. The only plaudits were the ones I read from the normally whacked-out film critics, most of whom never want to admit ""they don't get it"" or love a certain director no matter what he puts on screen. Many times, such as in this movie, there is ""nothing to get."" This is nothing but a nice parade of boobs on display - and even that got boring soon - and a lot of pretentious ""art.""Don't believe all those reviews that remark how ""thought--provoking"""" this movie is, etc, nor belittle yourself if you walked out of the theater and thought, ""huh?"" Consider yourself normal, honest human beings. Only the phonies, those pseudo-intellectuals, will blabber on and on about the merits of this film. It had no merit, cheapened sex in a big way, and was sad swan song for Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut
10,rmax304823,Night Life of the Gods.,7,20 March 2009,"One gets the impression that the detractors of this movie outnumber the admirers but I suspect that, if it's true, it's because the movie was directed by THE Stanley Kubrick. It's hard to top a string of hits, some of them near masterpieces. If it had been directed by some nonentity who had just graduated from film school it would have been hailed as a momentous debut.The plot. Doctor Tom Cruise is married to Nicole Kidman and they live on Central Park West in New York. After a party they get stoned and Kidman confesses that on their vacation last year, she noticed a naval officer and couldn't get him out of her mind, not even when she and Cruise were making love and developing plans for their life together. She'd have given up her future to be with this other man just for one night.Now these are ugly words for a husband to hear. He winds up walking the night-time streets, brooding about his wife and doubting his own grasp of things in general. He runs into a pal, a pianist, who quietly tells him that he's going to play the piano blindfolded at a secret party at a mansion. Everyone wears costumes. And he lets slip the password. He leaves, warning Cruise to forget everything he just heard.But Cruise is still tortured by Kidman's confession, rents a costume and mask, and attends the party. He's discovered as persona non grata and, surrounded by a hundred weirdos in dark costumes and garish masks, he's told to take off all his clothes.To make a long story short, he is ""redeemed"" -- ie., saved -- by a nude woman and he's allowed to leave. The next day Cruise learns that his pianist friend was hustled out of his hotel with a black eye by a couple of well-spoken hoods. And the woman who apparently volunteered to substitute her life for his is found dead of an overdose. Is it all coincidental? Cruise tells Kidman all about his overnight adventure and the two of them agree to believe that it was simply one of those things.It's slow. Mighty slow. Nobody speaks quickly. There are long pauses between utterances while one of the conversants stands open mouthed with expectation. The plot is wispy and filled with adventitious encounters. In all these respects, and more, it's a lot different from Kubrick's earlier stuff that, by comparison, seemed to rocket along propelled by the plots. But it's an obvious culmination of certain trends in Kubrick's later work, which is to say everything after ""Paths of Glory"" -- the episodic structure, the looseness of consequence, the introspection.There are, though, some interesting innovations. Kubrick had developed a habit of high key lighting. Everything was a fluorescent white in his late work, maybe with accents of color here and there, mostly apple red. There's unyielding light everywhere, as in a hospital operating room. In ""2001"" even the floors were translucent and lighted from below. He's reversed himself here, and it works too. It's Christmas time in New York. The streets are decorated with colored lights and interiors often have Christmas trees. The overall tone of the lighting is rosy and golden and warm all over, an ironic contrast to the disturbing goings on we witness.And there is more comedy that we might expect. There's an encounter with an odd hotel clerk, Alan Cumming, that is right out of the Enchanted Hunters scene in ""Lolita"" (both novel and film). And another ludic moment in the shop of a Jewish costumier who discovers his daughter, Leelee Sobieski, in flagrant dilecto with two Japanese transvestites, beats them up and locks them away for the police. When Cruise returns the costume the next day, the two Oriental gentleman emerge with Sobieski from a back room, happy as clams, and it becomes clear that the shop owner is pimping his own daughter.Before I run out of space -- and, believe me, this multi-layered effort deserves plenty of space -- I'll add a few asides. The piano theme that dominates the last half of the film is by a Hungarian madman, well, oddity actually, Ligeti, who built that ominous score almost entirely out of only two notes on the keyboard. It's an astonishing feat. Tom Cruise is something of an embarrassment as an actor, at least for me. I'm sure he's a nice guy and gives it everything he's got but I'm always aware that I'm watching some guy from New Jersey trying desperately to enact a role. It can't be the dialog, as elliptical as it sometimes gets, because Nicole Kidman is saddled with the same kinds of lines and she handles them smoothly. (By the way, she sports an exceedingly nubile figure in her skivvies. She's a lot sexier than the naked hookers at the party.) And it's not surprising that she's married to a doctor and lusts after an officer in the Navy. One projects immense wealth and the other power.",Eyes Wide Shut
11,moonspinner55,"Kubrick's cop-out: there's no sting in the writing, and hardly a chill in the air...",2,5 January 2009,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" looks great but never comes together. It has an impossibly long build-up which strives to tell us that a wealthy, seemingly happy married couple have cracks in their facade, which sends the husband ""out into the night"". Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick has shown tremendous talent with his actors, but even this auteur can't break through Tom Cruise's candy-coated shell (the movie is all about masks, but Cruise is wearing the biggest one, that of a movie star who can't escape his own inhibitions). Nicole Kidman is perhaps better, but her role is extremely weak (Kubrick has never had much affinity for his women). Does the picture hope to shock? To provoke? Is it a psychological thriller or a voyeur's fantasy? It seems to struggle with all these ingredients. In the end, it is mostly just dull and slow, one final glimpse of Kubrick revering himself and the potency of the heterosexual male. * from ****",Eyes Wide Shut
12,Quinoa1984,A Worthy Closing,10,10 February 2000,"Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut was his final film made (as many people know) and as it is his last it is no less than a perfect Stanley Kubrick film.  He can still grab you with his terrific filmaking in a sexual odyssey that seems not only extraordinary to his audience, but to himself as well (he took a twelve year interlude between making Full Metal Jacket in 1987 and this film).The acting is also superb, mainly by the real life husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as the couple who hold many secrets from each other.  The film goes on a little longer than some of Kubrick's past ones, but thats because there is a lot more detail in this picture than hin his other ones, including sexual rendevous, long dialogues and scenes of intrigue.  In short, this is Kubick's last, one of his best, and most intriguing films.",Eyes Wide Shut
13,michaelRokeefe,Eye opening journey into a perplexed relationship.,7,16 May 2000,"Stanley Kubrick's final film is far from the mainstream. In spite of pre-release praise, the movie fell short with the critics. Sexually graphic and with a script minus hard censorship, this movie explores a marital relationship that thrives on sex.Tom Cruise plays a doctor, who believes that his lovely wife has been unfaithful. Although it was only a mental fantasy on her part; the doctor goes wandering the streets of New York on a sexually driven quest.
Nicole Kidman is ravishing. Not only is she a believable actress; her nude scenes will dare you to blink. Clothed or not, Miss Kidman dominates her scenes.Sydney Pollack was flawless. Julienne Davis deserves applause for most beautiful corpse. WOW! It may take a second or third viewing to absorb this whole odyssey into sexual opportunities.

14,sunwarrior13,Kubrick's Last Film,9,9 October 2011,"Eyes Wide Shut is a erotic thriller that was directed, produced and written by Stanley Kubrick.It was based upon the novella Traumnovelle by Arthur Schnitzler.It stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. The story follows the sexually-charged adventures of Dr. Bill Harford (Cruise), who is shocked when his wife, Alice (Kidman), reveals that she had contemplated having an affair a year ago. He embarks on a night-long adventure, during which he manages to infiltrate a massive masked orgy of an underground cult.This sets him off into unfulfilled encounters with a dead patient's daughter and a prostitute.However, he quickly learns he is in well over his head and finds he and his family are threatened.The movie is the best film that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman had together to date.They portrayed the Harford couple very well.Their chemistry was great unlike their previous film like Days Of Thunder and Far And Away.Aside from that,the screenplay as it reaches to your emotions and into your deep thoughts.Watching this movie,it allows the viewer to undergo self-introspection in terms of our own sexuality and humanity.The direction of Stanley Kubrick was commendable as well. After watching his last film,he will surely be missed by the fans and movie industry.",Eyes Wide Shut

Extremely Slow in its Pacing and its Dreamlike celluloid Paintings can defect casual viewers but endear Lovers of the Eccentric.

17,dbborroughs,Kubrick loses his way,4,8 January 2008,"Stanley Kubrick's final film plays slightly better this second full time through, but at the same time its too frigging long.The plot of the movie that never ends (made in a shoot that never ended) is about a rich doctor who is haunted by a story his wife tells him of infidelity. This leads him on an odd odyssey that shakes up his world even further.When I saw this in the theaters on the night it opened I was so bored by it I left after the much over rated sex scenes at the masked ball. I made one later attempt at seeing it when it came out on home video and got all the way through it. Other visits with the film have come on cable where I criss crossed through the films recesses in odd clips. Recently I had a long discussion with a friend who loves the film and figured I'd try it again. To be certain his remarks, probably the most intelligent I've ever heard concerning the film, made me hopeful that I had missed something. I don't think so.The film concerns obsession and what a perceived infidelity will and can do to a man or woman. Cruise's dark journey all hinges on the fact that he can't get what his wife tells him out of his mind. Seeing it again for the first time in almost ten years I see little things that I probably missed the first time out. There is real power in the early scenes of Cruise and Kidman together and even apart as Kidman's unhappiness leads to flirtations and lustful thoughts that upset Cruise's sense of the world. I don't think that the whole masked cabal thing works, even on an allegorical level since the giant set piece of people having sex and performing rites seems to have been pulled in from a Hammer horror film. Whats even more deadly to the film is its over length and snail like pace. this is a two and a half hour film that feels twice that.Personally I wish Kubrick had lived a little longer since I'd have love to hear what his take on all of this was. At times the film seems like it wants to be a black comedy, at other times a porn film. Its a thriller at other times, though it really doesn't have a pay off, or if it does certainly not one that is worth fighting sleep for the better part of three hours. Seeing it again, I'm of the opinion that with the exception of one person I think most people who love this film are doing so because its Kubrick and they think he must have known what he was doing. I would argue that he didn't",Eyes Wide Shut
18,Boba_Fett1138,Successful as an artistic piece of work but not always as a movie.,8,24 September 2005,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is strange and has a very unusual story with multiple layers, symbolism and moments that remain unexplained. From an artistically point of view the movie is beautifully crafted. There are some beautifully shot sequence's and the nudity and sexual moments in the movie are brought in a beautiful, artistic way. It's really like you're watching a painting at times. As a movie the movie simply isn't always interesting enough and it doesn't leave an huge impression afterward. The unaccessible story also doesn't add to the reachability of the movie. It's beautifully made and shot all but it still as a somewhat disappointing last Kubrick movie despite the fact that I still rate this movie quite highly.Kubrick in his movies always tries to create a world on its own through its always somewhat typical unusual atmosphere. This movie never really succeeds an 100% in creating a good and believable unusual world on its own. Kubrick movies always have a beautiful but yet accessible and understandable unusual atmosphere while this movie just simply has an unusual, unusual atmosphere. It certainly provides the movie with some beautiful artistic moments but the more casual viewer will feel very distant from the movie and its story while watching this movie.The movie certainly is perfectly directed and the actors really give all they've got. I think it really is the story that makes this movie an unaccessible and far from perfect movie.Is it a worthy last Kubrick movie? Well, in my opinion yes. Even though this will not be the movie that he will always be remembered for, it still is a movie that has lots of typical Kubrick moments present, which makes this movie a must see for his fans. Perhaps that is also why this movie is just mainly only truly recommendable to the Kubrick fans.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Eyes Wide Shut
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Kubrick's final film... and possibly his least impressive,8,30 December 2004,"After having seen just about every single of Kubrick's films(The only films that are left are Spartacus, Lolita and his short films) and a documentary about him(Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures), I was looking forward to seeing his last film, despite it's reputation. Now that I've seen it, I'm not sure what to think... I don't know for sure if I agree with the common opinion that this is his least impressive film(even less impressive than The Shining). Don't get me wrong, it is a good film, but it just seems... I don't know, unfinished, rushed... like Kubrick didn't spend as much time filming as he should have. Maybe it's the actors, I don't know. It just seems... uneven, somehow. The plot is very good, and has a pretty good pace... but there are places where you're bored, and the film seemed to end too suddenly, I think(despite the film being quite long). The acting is, not unlike The Shining, less impressive than most of Kubrick's other films. Cruise is not an actor with a lot of range, that's for sure. Kidman is mostly believable, but, like Cruise, she seems more like an actor playing a part than the actual character, which distances us from their characters and thereby from the film itself. Not good. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The story is interesting, evolves at a very good pace and provides food for thought. I liked how the film presented infidelity and sex in general as acts lust and desire rather than affiliating them with love or emotion. I've heard many complain that the film was lacking sex scenes. This is a Kubrick film; just because the subject matter is directly intertwined with sex, doesn't mean that he's going to do the typical, simple Hollywood thing and just pack the movie with sex scenes. A talentless director could(and probably would) have done that. Anyone can make sex look appealing to the general public. It's much, much harder to make it seem unappealing and in fact almost disgusting... but Kubrick succeeds. He reminds us that sex is just a bodily function, something between two people that doesn't actually require emotions. It's physical by nature. The soundtrack is quite good too... there is a classical piece that can bring you to the edge of your seat just listening to it, and Kubrick pairs it up with great visuals. Maybe I should let you know that, while this I think this is one of his lesser films, it is still definitely a Kubrick piece. No doubt about it. Perfectly framed shots, slow pans and zooms, great music... and the ending, albeit being a bit sudden and leaving the viewer somewhat unsatisfied, still has the Kubrick touch and, whilst appearing to resolve the film, it also hints at something more sinister and unsettling. A good, maybe even great, film by the master of innovative storytelling, Stanley Kubrick. I recommend it to any fan of Kubrick. Anyone who isn't a fan, or at the very least isn't used to his style of film, should consider watching some of his other films first, as this is one of his heavier and less impressive ones(at least in my opinion). 8/10",Eyes Wide Shut
20,anaconda-40658,Eyes Wide Open.,10,30 July 2015,"Eyes Wide Shut (1999): Dir: Stanley Kubrick / Cast: Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sidney Pollack, Todd Field, Marie Richardson: Impressive final film by Stanley Kubrick addressing things we turn a blind eye to in fear of consequence. It stars Tom Cruise as a doctor with his wife played by Nicole Kidman. It is an epic of jealousy and obsession as a mere party becomes an evening of tense facts and taunting. Thus begins a very long and terrifying night of exoticism in its darkest form. Hauntingly tense unable to see the horror that looms ahead when Cruise discovers that asking too many questions is fatal. Cruise delivers an emotionally exhausting performance while Kidman is exotic as his wife who may harbor dark secrets of her own. Sidney Pollack plays a colleague with an overdosed hooker at the opening party. Todd Field plays a pianist who attended medical school but dropped out. He and Cruise get reacquainted and he reveals sessions at different locations where he plays blindfolded. This will lead Cruise to his most frightening nightmares in the forms of his guiltiest pleasures. Marie Richardson plays a woman whose father passed away and she comes on to Cruise. Vinessa Shaw plays a hooker who lures Cruise off the street. This is Kubrick at his very best as he addresses the mind's odyssey towards potential loss. The doctor can only hope to awaken from reality with his eyes wide open. Score: 10 / 10",Eyes Wide Shut
21,zetes,Kubrick's Second best after 2001,10,18 July 1999,"I think the critics, even the ones who like this film, are missing the point. When 2001 came out, most every critic panned it completely. Pauline Kael, the uber-critic, called it dull and unimaginative. At that time, I can understand her view. Kubrick's famous films that far were The Killing, Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lolita (the only one on this list I haven't seen), and Dr. Strangelove. All of these are wonderful films, Dr. Strangelove usually being considered his second masterpiece after 2001, but they lack the style of all the later Kubrick films. 2001 may be somewhat tedious to the average person once in a while, and it's almost uninterpretable, but it leaves posibly the strongest after-thoughts of any film. Kubrick's target was our love for narrative, but our unconscious minds. The pleasure of watching 2001 and Kubrick's other later films resides deep inside. It is too bad critics only have a few days to write their reviews. But by this time, they should have seen enough of Kubrick's films to realize this. The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, and Full Metal jacket all aged beautifully in my perception, and they all get better with each subsequent viewing. No other director who ever lived can do this.Only 2001 effects the unconscious mind more than Eyes Wide Shut. It is truly his second best film. It's images wander in my mind two days afterward as if I saw it an hour ago. I lay in bed the whole first night thinking about it, not sleeping for ten minutes. I didn't need to go to sleep to dream that night. The film seemed as if I dreamed it. The grainy film really added to that effect. And the color scheme. God, Kubrick was a genius to set this film at Christmastime. There are several gorgeous shots of Christmas lights. And a neon rainbow that especially lingers in my mind. And the religious orgy scene, which will undoubtedly become the most famous scene in the film, has colors that just made me weep with their heavenly beauty. Oh, and those purple sheets at the very end of the film. Critics complained about a speech near the end that undermined and ruined a nice murder mystery thread of the narrative (see especially Roger Ebert's review; though I love him, I think he's dead wrong this time). I think it would have been below Kubrick to end the film with a mysterious twist. Any director can give us a narrative trick at the end to put a goofy smile on our face. The idiotic ending of The Usual Suspects comes to the head of my mind. It's usually misinterpreted as genius because people don't realize that the sum of the parts ought to naturally be greater than one clever scene. If you want to see real genius, see Eyes Wide Shut, the second best film that Kubrick made, the second best film of the nineteen-nineties, and one of the best films ever made.",Eyes Wide Shut
22,Sylviastel,More Questions than Answers but we miss Kubrick!,10,16 January 2006,"I was a bit disappointed because I felt that I still need to know more about the party. I wanted to shake Sydney Pollack's character and asked him more questions. Why was he there? How do you join? Is it a secret club? What was the purpose of the red caped man? All I could think of was that the red caped man was a leader of a satanic cult. The music and the chanting of the words. Now if this was some kind of party, why did they have such creepy music and chanting. Then some of the masked guests or participants removed their capes, the women were beautiful but practically naked with only their masks and bikini bottoms. Then they all started touching each other as the music and chanting continued. Once they were done, they went off with the other cloaked men. We saw scenes of debauchery (I hope I use it properly) at this mysterious mansion. Naked women mostly and few naked men engage in sordid lovemaking. Of course, Pollack's character only hinted that the masks were protect the identities of the rich and powerful at these parties. No matter what, what was a prostitute doing there? When one woman risks herself to save Tom's character, we are expected to believe it was all an act. Come on, I can't believe that Tom's character was just playing a role in dark play. I'm sorry but I have so many questions about the house, the party, and the participants which left me kind of disappointed. While I love Kubrick, the film is worth watching but not for children or for the squeamish. We miss you Kubrick, wherever you are.",Eyes Wide Shut
23,JamesHitchcock,Kubrick's Last Haunting Masterpiece,9,29 July 2005,"This was Stanley Kubrick's last film, completed shortly before his death and twelve years after its predecessor, ""Full Metal Jacket"". Kubrick was capable of producing brilliantly original films quite different to anything else, such as ""A Clockwork Orange"", and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is another example of this ability. It can be seen as an erotic film, but that does not mean that it is pornographic or titillating. Rather, it is erotic in the sense that it deals with issues relating to physical love and sexuality, but it deals with them in an intelligent, sober manner.The mood of eroticism is set from the start. Bill Harford, a New York doctor , and his wife Alice have been invited to a Christmas party given by Victor Ziegler, one of his patients. At the party Harford is called to treat a naked young woman who is suffering from a drugs overdose. (It turns out that she is a prostitute). Both Harford and Alice flirt with others, he with two young models, she with a smooth but lecherous older man. Returning home, they get involved in a discussion about sexual attraction and jealousy, which leads Alice to confess that she once came close to being unfaithful.On the surface, Harford is a man who seems to have everything going for him- affluence, a successful practice which includes many wealthy and influential patients, of whom Ziegler is one, a luxurious apartment, marriage to an attractive wife and a young daughter. Like many films, however, this one is concerned to explore the hidden depths of character that can lie below a surface appearance of normality. Harford is called away from his discussions with Alice by a telephone call to attend a patient, and is plunged into a series of increasingly bizarre sexual encounters. The daughter of a dead patient attempts to seduce him, there is a meeting with another prostitute, he encounters an eccentric Eastern European costume-hire shop owner with a nymphomaniac daughter. The strangest of Harford's adventures comes after he meets Nick Nightingale, an old friend from medical college, in a bar. Nick is now working as a musician, and tells Harford of a mansion near the city where the rich and powerful meet to take part in sexual orgies, something Nick knows about because he is among those employed to provide musical entertainment at these gatherings. He tells Harford that one is due to take place that night and gives him the information he will need, including the password, to gatecrash the event.This is a multi-layered film that defies any simple interpretation. Harford's adventures can be interpreted either as reality, or as a sexual fantasy, or as a dream. The lack of any definite answer to this question is, however, a strength rather than a weakness. There is certainly something dreamlike about the film, especially the part dealing with his night-time odyssey through the city. (Most of the film, in fact, takes place either at night or in darkened rooms; only a few scenes take place in daylight). The orgy itself- the key scene in the film- is dealt with in a particularly surreal, hallucinatory style. It takes place in an opulent but chilly stately home, and takes the form of a strange, quasi-religious ritual performed by masked participants to the accompaniment of weird music. The women are all naked except for their masks, the men dressed in long hooded gowns similar to the robes worn by monks.On one level the film is about contemporary neuroses, both sexual and otherwise. Some of Harford's encounters can be seen as symbolic of fears about sexually transmitted disease (the prostitute he meets turns out to be HIV-positive) or sexual orientation (he is twice mistaken for a homosexual, once by a gang of hooligans and once by a gay hotel receptionist who tries to chat him up). The strange orgy, organised by a secretive group of men drawn from America's powerful and wealthy classes, may reflect conspiracy theories about domination by elite secret societies who ruthlessly exclude the public from their deliberations. Harford's attempt to gatecrash ends in failure when he is both literally and metaphorically unmasked as an impostor. On the other hand, this scene may have symbolic overtones about anonymous, impersonal sex or Freudian ones about fear of castration or impotence; Harford never takes part in any sexual activity, but remains a voyeur.Despite its dark overtones and disturbing symbolism, the film actually has an optimistic conclusion. Without wanting to give too much away, I can say that Harford makes some startling discoveries about both a friend and his wife, but these lead to a reconciliation between himself and Alice and a strengthening of their marriage. The action takes place just before Christmas, and brightly lit Christmas trees are a recurrent image, appearing in a number of scenes. These can be interpreted either as specifically Christian images or as more generalised symbols of hope and goodwill.I was never really convinced by Nicole Kidman, whose Alice too often seemed an odd mixture of childishness and sexual forthrightness. Tom Cruise, however, was very good in the main role of Harford. At times (as in ""The Last Samurai"") he can be guilty of overacting, but there was no trace of that here; his performance remained calm, controlled and deliberate, despite the bizarre experiences his character was going through. That Harford seemed emotionally in control throughout perhaps strengthens the idea that his adventures are to be interpreted as a dream or fantasy (as perhaps does the title).The music for the film is particularly memorable; not just that during the orgy scene, but also the recurrent simple piano motif and that Shostakovich waltz which is in itself capable of summoning up an atmosphere of elegant decadence. Kubrick's last film is also his last masterpiece, a strange, haunting fantasy and a work to stand alongside earlier masterpieces such as ""Paths of Glory"", ""Spartacus"", ""Dr Strangelove"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"". 9/10",Eyes Wide Shut
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,Kubrick's last and worst film,3,10 January 2004,"You know, I'm not a huge Kubrick fan, I'll admit. My sister even told me that I have to watch this a couple times to like it. Like ""Clockwork Orange"", I'm still drawing a blank. The plot is pretty bad. Tom Cruise is jealous of his wife's ""fantasy"", so he decides to revenge that by trying to sleep around. Or something like that.3/10",Eyes Wide Shut
25,MovieAddict2016,Look Closer,4,7 June 2004,"There's more to this movie than t & a. It was really made famous during its release because Tom and Nicole split. I doubt this was coincidental - they knew that splitting would cause more controversy over an already-controversial film. I'm not saying that they only split up because they wanted more attention for their film, but I have a feeling that they would have split up much sooner if not for the film. (Rumor has it they were bickering during filming and had to have instructions on how to create sexual tension, although Cruise - always quick to put down lurking insinuations of his sexuality - denied this.)It is the late, great Stanley Kubrick's last film, and one of his worst, but it is unfairly regarded as an X-rated R-rated movie (so to speak) when it really is a piece of tame masterwork. It's not as great as A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1973), 2001 (1968) or my personal favorite of Kubrick's, THE SHINING (1980), but it's better than FULL METAL JACKET (1987) and beautifully filmed.The plot: Cruise and Kidman are married in the film. She admits to him one night after getting stoned that she almost slept with a military figure years ago, so her husband haves a minor breakdown and slips into a bizarre sexual odyssey.The movie is packed with nudity and sex and even the advertising had an aroma of sleaze surrounding it, but it really is an important piece of work, and significant in the fact that it was Kubrick's final farewell to cinema. I wouldn't say it's underrated but I think that it's misinterpreted - it's far more than just a sleazy sex story with two huge sex symbols. Sure, watching Nicole shed her clothes off is great, but to say that's the ONLY point of the film is absurd. Quoting the tagline for AMERICAN BEAUTY: ""Look closer...""",Eyes Wide Shut
26,KineticSeoul,Stanley Kubrick's final film,6,16 January 2013,This is a compelling movie that has a bit of suspense and sexual aspects to it. Like some Stanley Kubrick's other films this is one of those movies that is kinda uncomfortable to watch. The portrayal of sexual thoughts between William Harford(Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice(Nicole Kidman) is interesting. This is a very provocative film that has to do with psychotic and sexual thoughts and behaviors. It isn't one of Kubrick's best work though but still a engaging movie from beginning to end although it can be messed up sometimes. Actually a lot of times. Although it lacks the impact in most Kubrick's films his pacing and way of revealing certain elements as the movie progresses is well crafted. And also knows how much to show and how much to leave in the audiences imagination.6.9/10,Eyes Wide Shut
27,OllieSuave-007,Mysteriously bewitching.,6,14 June 2014,"This is a sensual and complex movie about a doctor whose wife's almost-committing infidelity drives him to explore a sexual underworld. More than just lust and sex, this film is full of drama and the consequences of infidelity and the doctor's forbidden visit of the sexual underworld. The atmosphere of the film is dark and mysterious, as I thought the characters gave a somewhat enticing acting performance. Kidman was good, but, I thought Cruise was a little more on the mediocre side.Though the film is full of suspense, the plot is a little difficult to follow due to its many twists; the story really tugs at your mind and heart in a haunting way as you try to follow the lead characters and their relationships. Overall, it's a mysteriously bewitching film. Not one of the greatest out there, but OK to watch on a slow night.Grade C",Eyes Wide Shut
28,sddavis63,It Doesn't Disappoint But It Does Frustrate,7,2 April 2011,"Part of the Stanley Kubrick collection of movies (and, indeed, the last in the Kubrick collection) and starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (when they were themselves a happily married couple), ""Eyes Wide Shut"" doesn't disappoint, but it does frustrate a bit. It's an erotic thriller of sorts, and as such it manages to accomplish most of what you'd expect such a film to do. It IS erotic. It is very much about sex and sexuality and hidden desires and how they affect the relationships we have with those around us. There is a LOT of nudity in this - but somehow, the nudity didn't seem either gratuitous or exploitative. It was natural to this story; indeed, the story wouldn't have worked at all without the nudity. So the nudity involved (which featured a significant amount of Nicole Kidman) doesn't seem intended to titillate (although one can't really complain about a virtual parade of beautiful and often completely naked women) but rather it focuses the story and moves it along. As a thriller, it doesn't really thrill. It's more of a mystery - and it's a pretty good one there as well. There's really no strong sense of where this is going or of what the point of it is, aside from following Dr. Harford (Cruise) on his 24 hours or so of almost (but never quite) debauchery while his wife (Kidman) stays at home sleeping and looking after their daughter. In that sense it does manage to hold your attention very well. You want to know what this is about. What is this seemingly semi-pagan sex club that Harford stumbles upon; who are the people involved in it; are there going to be any repercussions for Harford and his family. In all those ways this is very good and very interesting. But ...As good as it is in almost every way, in the end this movie frustrates because it never really answers anything. The mysteries are all left standing at the end. We never really do find out much about the ""club"" or the people in it, except that they're apparently powerful people who don't want to be known. Harford and his wife seem to put things back together in the end, but we don't really know if there are any lasting repercussions from the adventure of the preceding 24 hours. We don't really know. In the end, that left me feeling a little bit cheated. I wanted to know more about what had happened. I understand that the story had been about the struggles in the relationship of Harford and his wife more than about the ""adventure"" itself, but most of the movie was tied up with the adventure. Something in the end seemed missing from this.It's a good movie. Good story; good directing; good performances. I have no arguments about any of that. In the end, though, it just left me unsatisfied.

29,Buddy-51,flawed Kubrick opus,6,29 July 1999,"Is it heresy or sacrilege to suggest at this late date - and particularly in light of his recent death -  that Stanley Kubrick's films have almost always been better at promising than delivering greatness?  Almost without exception, Kubrick's carefully crafted works have emerged as brilliantly clinical ""exercises"" rather than fully involving works of timeless art. Audacious, visionary, always willing to push the envelope and challenge an audience to go where it may not want to - these are the hallmarks of Kubrick's directorial genius.  But, along with these virtues, comes a heavy list of counterweighing weaknesses that somehow distance an audience emotionally from what is occurring on the screen:  pretentiousness, laborious pacing, narrative choppiness, often static camerawork.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" fits perfectly into this standard Kubrick mold.  Starting with a fascinating premise, Kubrick takes his audience into unexpected and challenging directions, yet fails to really cope with the complexities of the theme and make the audience care.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman portray a young, upwardly mobil couple, who live in New York City with their young daughter.  When Kidman, in one of the year's best scenes, reveals in a wrenching monologue that she has had serious thoughts of infidelity, Cruise discovers he can't cope with the visions this admission conjurs up.  Thus, he embarks on a sexual odyssey through the streets of the city which leads him into many bizarre and unexpected avenues of depravity including a club made up of the idle rich dressed in costumes and masks who stage orgies replete with secret passwords and portentous organ music.  The problem lies essentially with the Kubrick/Frederick Rafael screenplay which can't seem to connect these scenes of flamboyant nastiness with the theme that is at the film's core.  Cruise drifts into each of his adventures out of an understandable urge to experience this world of sexual perversity, but he seems to end up as a passive observer each time, with little or no revelation registered.  This concept - of examining the effect that even implied infidelity can have on relationship - is such a rich one that it becomes a shame to see it buried under these scenes of often extraneous ostentation.  Kubrick seems so enamored of his little ""visions"" that they begin to dominate the proceedings and bury the theme and the characters. This weakness is reflected in the film's far too tidy resolution, which is thoroughly unconvincing from a psychological viewpoint and makes one wonder how Kubrick could linger so long over scenes with no purpose beyond the sensational yet take so little time with the one that truly matters.  Cruise and Kidman both turn in fine performances, but Sydney Pollack, as a wealthy friend who later in the film sets Cruise straight, hams it up shamelessly. The music is hauntingly effective and helps immeasureably to establish and sustain an atmosphere of portentous weirdness. The title ""Eyes Wide Shut"" will not describe most people in the audience - Kubrick is too skilled at creating an always riveting visual motif for that - but, for me, it will serve as a lasting testament less to his genius than to his maddening inability to fulfill his always great promise.",Eyes Wide Shut
30,cherold,Lesser Kubrick,6,24 August 2017,"Not much happens in Eyes Wide Shut, yet somehow the movie kept my attention. It's weirdly interesting, but not necessarily good. Because of that, it seems much shorter than its almost three-hour length.While Nicole Kidman got better reviews than husband Tom Cruise, they really gave basically the same performance, which is mainly comprised of talking really slowly. I give no credit or blame to either of them for that, since it's clearly what Kubrick wanted.But that's Kubrick for you. He knew what he wanted, he got what he wanted, and then the audience liked it or didn't. He was an uncompromising visionary, and while I would have liked his final movie to be something I actually enjoyed, I do admire his lack of compromise.Still, for me the most entertaining moment of the movie was when Cruise groped Kidman and my girlfriend whispered (""probably the first time that's ever happened."")",Eyes Wide Shut
31,Lejink,The dark night...,8,28 May 2011,"Talk about your long dark night of the soul. This is a deliberately unsettling exploration of jealousy, sexual curiosity and deviance masked under a morality tale against adultery and drug-taking...I think. Kubrick's very adult film takes us into the world of successful New York doctor Tom Cruise (""Dr Bill Harford"") and Nicole Kidman and from the simple opening of them leaving their infant child in the charge of their baby-sitter to attend a glitzy Christmas party hosted by the mega-rich Sydney Pollack, sees them subject to sexual temptation with third parties (two for one in Cruise's case) from which they just about extricate themselves. However, post-party and back in their own bed, we see them smoking a joint and gradually fashion an argument, culminating in Kidman's shocking admission to her husband about a sexual fantasy she had over a soldier some time before, even when in her husband's company. One surprise call for Cruise to attend the death of his old mentor gives him the opportunity to explore his darker side and attempt to expiate the vision of Kidman and her fantasy love which fuels his actions.I can't claim to understand the many facets of this strong film but was certainly held from one discomfiting scene to the next. First Cruise is almost seduced by the grieving daughter of the dead man whom he's attending, then he similarly pulls back from a liaison with a kindly (as it turns out very kindly prostitute) thanks to a timely phone call from his wife, before finally his curiosity and motivations get the better of him and he gate-crashes a sinister masqued orgy where apparently anything goes but in truth all is carefully orchestrated, monitored and controlled. On the way though, he witnesses a troubling situation at the fancy-dress shop whose owner he gets up after hours to furnish him with the required disguise for the ball, with the owner's obviously barely pubescent daughter is caught almost in-flagrante with what appears to be a father and son Oriental pair.The centrepiece of the film and the one that perhaps demonstrates Kubrick's powers most is the orgy scene. A deliberately constructed long slow tease of a scene with the viewer made to follow Cruise's subjective voyeuristic gaze as he wanders through the plush, massive rooms of the secret mansion, witnessing sexual acts performed in dumb show for the specially invited guests to a backdrop of a gloomy but haunting piano refrain. Thus we the viewer feel the danger of the faceless Mr Big who catches Cruise out in his deception who to protect the anonymity and exclusivity of his ""parties"" that he will extract the highest price to deter interlopers in the future.I found myself carried along uneasily on Cruise's coat-tails and of course are made to examine our own morality and sexual mores and even as it seems both Cruise may have just about learned his lesson, that shocking last word on camera of Kidman's perhaps gives the lie to that. Of course it could all have been a drug-fuelled dream/nightmare of Cruise's, which would help explain the enigmatic title of the movie...Both leads are very good in what must have been difficult parts to play, especially as they were of course married at the time. The support players were all as significant but unobtrusive as they needed to be. However it's in the orchestration of the set, actors, lighting, camera movement and music that one sees a great director at work. I doubt I could have been persuaded subject matter like this without knowing that the likes if Kubrick was behind the camera.As it happened, it turned out of course to be his last movie and what a demanding, challenging, even risky one it turned out to be. While I couldn't argue it as the best movie in his oeuvre, it is obviously the work of a major talent and testimony that he maintained his considerable powers to the end.",Eyes Wide Shut
32,ElMaruecan82,Kubrick's epitaph to Humanity ...,10,1 February 2011,"There is something profoundly sad in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" ... is it because it's the last film of Stanley Kubrick, the Maestro, this gifted talent who put the word genius and movies together ? or because of this feeling of melancholic futility inhabiting the life of this couple who's got everything to be happy, yet seems to have registered to a formula where sex is an episodic necessity made of an ephemeral pleasure, and the rest is an ersatz of normality built around not to feel like something precious is being wasted ... indeed, boredom never seemed so real, so palpable, in a movie ironically made of movements and dialogs ... but the sadness is from this couple who chose ""deception as a necessity"" ... the boredom is inside, imperceptible, which makes it even more pathetic. Only Kubrick could have made Cruise and Kidman so charming and pathetic in the same time.There is a kind of inner pathos in this bourgeois way of life, that would be scary if it wasn't so comic sometimes. Take Bill's insistence that he's a doctor as to give himself more credibility in some critical situations where self-importance might be helpful, Alice's morbid and paranoid pot-smelling approach to marital relationships, looking for an excuse to make her husband jealous, this jealousy used to spice up a meaningless life ... marriage as a false remedy and real catalysis of perversity (indeed, since perversity literally means, to deviate from). And that's the meaning of these acts, deviating from the road of monotony. It's not about sex but about feeling alive through desire, desire as a desire to be desired.Felling alive through the desire to be desired? Why? Is that because it's so normal to be desired by a husband that the feeling of love becomes artificial, does it feel like belonging to a world with no room for passion, for heart, for life. A fake world. A dreamy world, like sleeping and waiting for the awakening. Like a lucid dream with no awakening, is that Alice and Bill's nightmare ? Is that marriage ? a mutual lucid nightmare ? Bill lives in the illusion of happiness when Alice lives in the pursuit of an adulterous desire. But Bill is too intelligent not to realize the sadness of his condition and Alice too in love, not to admit the futility of her quest. They need each other, because Bill has no alternative and neither has Alice. Hence the lucid nightmare, and the only way to wake up is honesty ... or an extraordinarily scary journey into the ""other world"".Yes, the turning point is Bill's sexual ""adventure"" during the film, discovering sex outside the marriage, like an odyssey into the underground, the world of illegitimate sex, through an investigation consumed by a jealous flame lit by Alice. A world made of fantasy expressed during the most peculiar moments, a world of extreme decadence where sex sounds like sect ... from a philosophical commentary of the danger of marital routine, the movie turns into a fascinating thriller where things doesn't seem like the way they are, making us wondering what hides behind those creepy masks, those pagan psalms. A reminiscent of the paranoid feeling from ""Rosemary's Baby"" making us wondering if this is staged, or real, if its meaning is scary or if it is meant to be scary. The rituals we witness from Bill's point of view behind the thrills, highlight how we, humans, finally still need conventions even in the satisfaction of our lowest instincts, sex with a prostitute as a retributed service, sex as a fantasy hiding behind the curtain of reality, and sexual adult games so staged and sacred they become as institutional as marriage. Maybe we need to humanize our bestiality, to make it ridiculously human, not to feel like animals. Normal people go perverse to feel alive, and perverse people act conventionally to feel human, normality leads to perversity which fatally gets you back to normality. This is the whole vanity of perversity ...And at the end, Bill realizes he didn't value his luck to be with Alice and Alice realizes that her thirst and desire of lust was just a burst of ego, that would have made things worse and scarier had they become reality. They were saved by their love for each other like Bill's faithfulness prevented him from sex with a prostitute that'll be revealed to have AIDS and Alice realizing through her fantasy that she indeed loved her husband, even if it was in a very sad way. How such a positive conclusion can be so sad? Maybe because the ""other world"" is even more dangerous and scary, and the illusory warm comfort of a castle made of bullshit stinks less than the reality of this bourgeois debauchery. Kidman sums it up quite well, when she expresses her disdain towards the ""Forever"" word, nothing is sure, let's just admit it, but not say it. Now, they feel normal but they must feel alive, by igniting the desire that was almost extinguished by those doubts and treacheries. They just need ... she uses the F word, probably less obscene and more sincere than ""Forever""Oh yes, I really didn't expect these last lines, but they couldn't be truer and more powerful, they perfectly fit the film, and I guess after ""Don Corleone"" these will be my most memorable concluding lines from a movie, I didn't expect such an optimistic, or let's say bittersweet ending ... all I can say is that the Maestro knows how to fit a music with the theme of a film. Optimism and sadness, fear and nostalgia, desire and passion, wisdom and realization ... beautifully embodied in the beautiful Waltz that made me cry at the end, with my eyes wide open, before shutting them and letting one tear running on my face, a tear to the memory of an immortal genius called ... Stanley Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut
33,gbill-74877,Brilliant,9,27 February 2021,"Temptation, flirtation, fixation. The strange ways the heart and libido work, set amidst gorgeous light and color, and to a wonderful soundtrack. Those masks at the sex cult were fantastic! But some of the film's most erotic moments are in its first 20 minutes, when flirtation comes from the eyes and mouth, and a terrible nearness. Nicole Kidman is brilliant in this, and I thought it was clever of Kubrick to bookend the film with an opening shot of her disrobing and the ending line of what she and her husband (Tom Cruise) need to do. The film lagged a teeny bit as Cruise's character stumbles through trying to sort things out, and regularly responds to what was said to him by slowly repeating it back in the form of a question, but by that point I didn't care. I loved the areas the film probed, how I wasn't sure which direction it was going to go, and the superb quality of its filmmaking. I also loved the costume shop character (Rade Serbedzija), that guy was funny.Quote:

36,atlasmb,A Classic,10,2 March 2020,"One of the most underrated films of all time, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the result of an intense collaboration between Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and Stanley Kubrick. Its title suggests an elusive meaning, a conundrum. And that is what the film delivers as presented from the viewpoint of its protagonist, Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise).Kubrick delivers a visually stunning piece of cinema---with its striking emphasis on color and light---wrapped around an odyssey that is laid over a tale of domestic disquiet. Just as some films include numerous memorable quotes, EWS includes numerous images that stick with you forever.The theme of the film is about the structures of society and its conventions, like marriage, which overlay the raw realities of the human psyche. It is a film of manners that lies like a thin veneer over the uncertainties and brutalities of uncivilized man that always lurk where we dare not look. But EWS dares and provokes us to follow its exploration of the seams of civility, the indulgences that few can afford. It seems to say, like Eliot'sPrufrock, ""Let us go then, you and I..."" I refer you to the rest of that stanza which seems so relevant here.The film also has a cadence that draws you in. Moments of calm and enchanting certainty are punctuated by scenes of confusing happenstance and a nagging insistence that some upheaval impends. Dream-like beauty always seems to be on the verge of interruption. This is a meditation on the investments and sacrifices we make to achieve happiness, success, or the tranquility of perceived certainty.EWS includes some wonderful supporting performances in addition to its captivating starring roles. Particularly noteworthy is the performance of Leelee Sobieski, who plays a girl of mysterious circumstances and intentions.Perhaps one day this film will sit atop the popular lists that enshrine the best of cinema where it deserves to be.",Eyes Wide Shut

38,slightlymad22,Kidman Shines,6,4 October 2017,"Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Eyes Wide Shut (1999)Plot In A Paragraph: A New York City doctor (Cruise) who is married to an art curator (Nicole Kidman) pushes himself on a harrowing and dangerous night-long odyssey of sexual and moral discovery after his wife admits that she once almost cheated on him.Though often referred to as Stanley Kubrick's ""unfinished masterpiece"", the final edit of the film was actually presented to Warner Bros. (by Kubrick) a full four days before his death, though the score and some special effects (computer generated people during the orgy scene) were not finalized.I have never got into this movie, it just left me cold the other two times I watched it. Watching it now, I still don't think it works. It does it surprise me that I don't love this movies though. Spartacus, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket aside, I do not enjoy Kubrick movies. I just never understood the praise lavished upon his movies. It is uncomfortable to watch, and it does have a good sense of creepy atmosphere, and the score is particularly eerie too. This is probably the least colourful Cruise performance in quite some time. (I'd go back to Far & Away) sometimes he is good, but other times less so. Kidman, on the other hand, is excellent. This is her best performance she has given in a Crusie movie (her final one) and is definitely a sign of what a great actress she is!! And what a fine bum she had too. Vinessa Shaw, Todd Field, Marie Richardson, Alan Cumming and Leelee Sobieski (an actress I always liked, and thought was destined for big things) all stand out in supporting or small roles. This was the first Stanley Kubrick movie to open at number one in the U.S (it was Cruise's sixth consecutive chart topper) but it was not a hit at the box office. It only grossed $55 million to end 1999 the 42nd highest grossing movie of the year. Cruises worst performing movie since Legend in 1986.",Eyes Wide Shut
39,sol-,My brief review of the film,10,13 January 2005,"A perfectly photographed and superbly directed film about the state of modern marriages and how society is heading, in a world that is becoming increasingly morally decaying. The mystery element of the film provides it with a perfect atmosphere to set up the confused emotions of the main character, and gives the film an intriguing quality. The background music is excellent, and the cast is superb. The emotional state that Tom Cruise is able to bring to his character is totally believable, and film directors Sydney Pollack and Todd Field have interesting supporting roles. The film is nonetheless quite long for the subject matter at hand, but besides for this there is little wrong with the film. Some were repelled by the frequent nudity and sexual content of the film, however without such, this would not be the modern masterpiece it is. Certainly quite a high note for Kubrick to have ended his career on.",Eyes Wide Shut

41,johnnyboyz,......but keep your mind wide open.,7,21 October 2009,"There's a scene in Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, in which the lead feels he is being followed by an unruly and somewhat antagonistic force down a public street. The setting is the night; the location is a usually bustling city and the happenings within the frame capture what's at stake for these people. A certain Dr. William Harford (Cruise) stands by a stand selling items; his surveyor at the end of the street, keeping a watchful eye on the good doctor, whilst himself perched between two very distinct locales: a large, welcoming restaurant and a sex shop displaying the latest in lingerie. In a very basic sense, and given what Harford knows at this point about the stalker, the two locales the follower stands between represent Harford's predicament: carrying on with what you're doing and keeping quiet equates in being able to carry on in life, best represented by the restaurant offering food, or 'life' - indeed salvation. The alternative is the sex shop across the road, the option to quash one's guilt about what happened at the mansion and spill the beans on what he saw and was told would happen. We are led that the repercussions, however, would equate in pain for William and his family; possibly even death.In one sequence lasting about fifteen seconds but running on some previous material, the film manages to touch on ideas of guilt and sex as a weapon or as a piece of blackmail whilst incorporating a certain sense of horror and adding to what was, up to this point, feeling like a suburban drama of some description. The brief shift in mood has us momentarily frightened, that a force we were not expecting in this 'type' of film does indeed exist, and possesses an ability to harm. Kubrick's final film, 1999's Eyes Wide Shut, seems to be a mediation on sexuality and the urge to further sexual ventures. Like Polanski's Bitter Moon before it, the film is about a male lead attempting to further his sexual horizons; with the hitch that he is running on ego and lust more-so a slower and more natural sensation which demands he should try new things in his own time.William has a wife named Alice (Kidman), and they have one very young daughter. They dress extravagantly, play classical music as they get ready for nights out and they attend functions that embrace public holidays and display works of art, all in the metropolis that is New York City. I'm not sure if saying that the film ""isn't really about them as a couple"" is entirely correct, although you will not come away from the film with the nourishing sense of accomplishment born out of their relationship-come-marriage. Essentially, the film is a circular journey for Bill; beginning and immediately ending with head on and frank interaction with his wife. More-so for me, the film is purely about the male, in this case the husband, Bill. The spark that lights his fuse and refrains it from burning out is talk with Alice about how she once felt for a Naval officer many years ago, something that is intensified when his conflicting feelings clash following a call-out to a patients house. Prior to hearing Alice's story, Bill actively flirts with two young models at the function whereas at the home of a woman's dead father, post-conversation, Bill talks and interacts with said woman but turns down any advances.For all the shops selling lingerie; the naked lead characters and for all the nudity and fetishistic animal masks that come with that particular segment, the film is exceedingly un-erotic or 'un-titalating'. Why? Because there is a certain danger linked to these things: the already established sex shop is iconographically on one 'side' of the road in which the lead could cross, but it would spell disaster; the naked women lying motionless in a recreational room is there because of a drug overdose while the outrageous sequence of several naked bodies wandering around a large house and having intercourse over a soundtrack of odd chanting instills fear more than anything else born out of the fact that we, the lead character, should not be there – and are in grave danger.Bill's further descent is emphasised when a group of young men call into question his sexuality, accusing him of looking like a homosexual and when his stumbling into a jazz club and an interaction with a musician he's known of for years going back to medical school prods things along, there's no going back upon hearing of a strange place in which strange goings on occur. The film works well and stands up to Kubrick's prior work, with the entire de-robing sequence being able to be placed on that mantle with any other 'out there' sequence from Kubrick's work: scenes such as Slim Pickens' riding of the atomic bomb and the visionary sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey as the lead journeys to where only very few, if any, have ever been before.Eyes Wide Shut is an accomplished film; a piece that carries dramatic weight and retains its focus and guile. The film is frightening, but it is the nature of human beings that scares us the most in the picture; and those with such carefree attitudes to sexual goings on around them: the owner of a clothes shop regarding what he can do with his daughter and a certain Victor Ziegler (Pollack), who knows why naked women got to be how they are at his place but shows no real compassion to them: they are to be used and disregarded if they step out of line. This was certainly no shameful departure for Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut
42,kapelusznik18,Hidden in Plain Sight,8,27 January 2015,"****SPOILERS****Stanley Kubrick's last film that he delivered the rough cut to Warner Brothers studios a week before he suddenly passed away at age 70 is filled with innuendos about secret societies that control or are controlled by those in power who really run things in the world at large. This strange world of power and control is discovered almost by accident by young doctor William Hartford, Tom Cruise, who after his wife Alice, Nicole Kidman, confessed to him in having an affair with a handsome US naval officer, who ends up doing a series of naval maneuvers on her, the year before while on vacation at Cape Cod. William who feels that he's been cheated on by his wife now wants to have a good time of his own by going out at night to the city's red light district and pick up hookers and get even with Alice for what she did to him.With the help of his friend pianist Nick Nightingale,Todd Field, William now looking for bigger kicks and thrills then a one night stand with a hooker that are places where the kicks or fun is both hot & heavy that are far more interesting as well as exciting if he's got the balls to go to and experience them. William soon gets himself invited to this costume party in the suburbs where he's told, by Nightingale, that everyone there lets it all hang out and does their thing without any interruption from the outside world. As things soon turn out it becomes apparent to the very naive William Hartford that he's way over his head with the people he's involved in and the things he sees, if reviled, may well end up having him and his family members murdered. In fact one of the masked women at the party who tried to get him to leave later ended up dead from a drug overdose.The film has William slowly realize that things aren't what he thinks that they are with those whom he associates and parties with like some of his friends on the outside world. It's William's good friend jet set billionaire party thrower Victor Ziegler, Sydney Pollack, who later fills in the gaps to the persons and events that William got involved with at the costume party. William earlier had saved Sydney's a** by getting a young woman who overdosed on drugs in Victor's pad emergency treatment in order to keep Victor's both name out of the papers as well as a** from ending up behind bars. It was Victor's intervention that in fact prevented the members of the secret society that William spied on from doing both him and his wife Alice in.****SPOILERS**** In the final moments of the movie it's William, who's been going through hell for what he saw and experienced, who ends up in a state of shock in him finding out that it was his wife Alice whom he tried to get revenge on, for cheating on him, who was behind this entire scam. Broken and defeated, in seeing that he's not in charge of his life, William now meekly goes along with his wife's wishes to forget about the past and just go on with their lives as if nothing happened. Interesting but uneven film about those who really control things in the world of finance and politics as well as our individual lives. With the sad fact that it's director Stanley Kubrick didn't live long enough to edit and release his director's cut, like he did in almost all of his movies, of the film that would have smoothed things out and explained its many rough and uneven edges.",Eyes Wide Shut
43,howard.schumann,"Beautifully shot, impeccably acted, and consistently engrossing",9,28 August 2006,"Beautifully shot, impeccably acted, and consistently engrossing, Eyes Wide Shut is a fitting finale to the career of Stanley Kubrick. Taking us ""where the rainbow ends"", Eyes Wide Shut leads us through several days in the life of upper class New York Doctor Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) as he navigates through New York's sexual underground in a fit of jealousy. Based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 Traumnovelle (Dream Novella), it is a film without explanations and the viewer must decide what is real and what is fantasy. From the outset, it is clear that there is trouble in the Harford's nine-year old marriage, though it has not yet affected their eight-year old daughter Helena (Madison Eginton) who is eagerly looking forward to Christmas.The first hint that something is not right is when Bill tells his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) how great her hair looks without bothering to look at her. She does not say anything but her body language suggests that she is dissatisfied. The tension between them becomes crystallized during a party thrown by a wealthy acquaintance, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack) in which she draws the attention of a charming Hungarian suitor and he is pursued by two attractive models. ""One of the charms of married life is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties,'' the suave Hungarian tells Alice.The events lead afterward to a discussion of marital fidelity. Upset over Bill's lack of jealousy, Alice, who has been smoking pot, recounts a fantasy she had about abandoning her family for a handsome naval officer she met at a resort hotel. Feeling that he has to prove his virility, Bill, in the vein of Scorcese's After Hours, undertakes a 48-hour odyssey through the dark side of New York looking for reassurance from a sexual partner. As in a recurring dream, at the moment before satisfaction is achieved - intruders, a cell phone, or a threat to his safety interrupts each experience. In his journey, he encounters the daughter of a deceased patient; a prostitute; the underage daughter of a costume salesman; a threatening group of homophobes, and a male hotel desk clerk who is turned on to him.The piece de resistance, however, is an extravagantly staged costumed orgy at a swank Long Island mansion. Lured by the piano player Nick Nightingale (Todd Field) who interests Dr. Harford with a story of mysterious gigs he plays blindfolded, he is led through a medieval-looking forest to a black Mass for the rich and powerful in which everyone is masked and costumed. When the doctor is exposed as an intruder, he is in real danger until a stately woman who has given him prior warnings to leave, saves him from at the very least taking his clothes off (from what else we can only guess).Although Cruise as D. Harford is the centerpiece of the film, he shows little emotion. He is either looking bewildered or acting uncomfortably sincere but he is always a passive onlooker. One expects that at some point he will confront himself and grasp the meaning of what is taking place, but there are no epiphanies or realizations. It is only when Alice, perhaps suspecting that she has gone too far in her story telling, asks Bill what they will do now, do they drop their masks and come to terms with the realities of their relationship.Eyes Wide Shut was Kubrick's final film and it is one of his best. Enhanced by an original score by Jocelyn Pook, darkly evocative piano music by Gyorgy Ligetti, and excerpts from Shostakovich, the film maintains its tension throughout and never lets us know where it is going. Although the mood suggests a decadent civilization careening out of control, Eyes Wide Shut ended up for me as a life-affirming experience. It challenges us not only to come to terms with our commitments in life but to better distinguish the difference between our thoughts and feelings and our true experience of ourselves and the people around us who give our life its meaning.",Eyes Wide Shut
44,Anonymous_Maxine,"""Soshall we?""",10,1 May 2008,"I have a feeling that Kubrick's stunningly masterful visual exploration of human sexuality will be overshadowed by the major amount of nudity in it, and the graphic sex scenes. It seems that the movie is more well-known because Nicole Kidman is fully nude in it (and Tom Cruise, conspicuously, is heavily covered, even his hands, throughout), despite the fact that she was fully nude in Billy Bathgate back in 1991 but no one cares much about that. Maybe she wasn't famous enough back then. At any rate, she is nude within literally about the first 5 seconds of the film, when we meet her and her husband Dr. Bill Harford. They have been invited to a classy dinner party which illustrates their place in society, and we meet them as they are getting ready to go out. Clearly, they live a very good life, seemingly much more than even a doctor could afford, given that they live in New York in a sizable mansion. They have been married and faithful to each other for 9 years, have a beautiful 7- year-old daughter, and a very comfortable home. Life is secure, but even in this opening scene, there is an undercurrent of something missing, almost as though they are just going through the motions of their marriage. Alice (Kidman) laments that Bill blandly tells her she looks great without even looking at her, and Bill isn't too excited about the party at all.But the real problem with their marriage is presented in a way that only Kubrick could come up with. Cruise and Kidman are beautiful people, so it's easy to accept a classy older man being extremely direct with his interest in a romp with Alice (""then and there,"" as she explains later), and that two stunningly beautiful women will attempt to seduce Bill, all at about the same time. Neither is unfaithful, but this event sets off a chain reaction that leads them down an alarming road. Later, when Alice asks Bill if he had sex with those two women (in much more colorful language than I am allowed here), he sort of laughs it off and assures her that he did not. What he doesn't notice at first is that she doesn't seem the least bit upset or worried when she asks him this, she seems blithely interested, even curious, as though part of her hopes that he did, which would allow her to form some kind of justification in her own mind about being unfaithful herself, something that she has clearly thought about. When she hears that he didn't, she's not very happy, and she lashes out at him with a story that creeps into his mind and turns his life upside down. She has always been faithful to him, but she tells him a story of something that happened that might have been even worse.A lot of people criticize the movie for how slow it is in a sad misunderstanding of one of the movie's greatest strengths. It has a strange, dream-like quality that derives from its pacing, and this is not an accident, nor is it meant just to make the movie run as long as it is. And it is not about sex, either. This should be obvious, I think. Sex happens in the movie, but it's not about sex, but sexuality. The difference is bigger than you think. It's about the fact that humans are essentially animals with very primal physical needs, but we lift ourselves above beasts by controlling those desires and channeling them into meaningful relationships. This, the movie seems to suggest, is one of the reasons why an unfaithful spouse is such a crippling blow to someone. The most moral and sacred pact of the marriage has been broken.More specifically, it seems to suggest a human desire (amidst both males and females) for anonymous sex, in the sequence where Bill manages to get into the mansion and witness this taking place, and the vicious threats that he receives when he is discovered. A lot of people have called this a dream sequence, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me, since it is so clearly not. It's bizarre, yes, but I didn't notice anything that would suggest very strongly that it's a dream, outside of the allowance for this possibility. It may have just been left open to that possibility to provoke discussion, but it works better as a real experience than as a dream. Later, Alice confesses a real dream, which is disturbingly close to what Bill saw at that house, and it is a tremendous blow to him.It should be noted that the movie goes to great lengths to explore the trust in a marriage, and both parties are desperately hurt by what the other has said or done, yet neither of them were ever unfaithful to the other. The performances are phenomenal throughout, and made better by an astonishingly well-written script. You may notice, as the movies nears the end, that remarkably little actually happens in it, and yet the movie says so much. It makes a striking comment about the role of sex in a relationship, and yet never exploits it. Sadly, a lot of moviegoers are too shortsighted or narrow-minded to understand the film, which is why you get people saying it's the worst thing that Kubrick has ever come out with. It is very normal for a person to condemn as ridiculous something that they can't understand, and this will happen with this movie. But make no mistake, the movie is brilliant, and more than a worthy addition to Kubrick's short but powerful iconography",Eyes Wide Shut
45,jzappa,"When You Look in the Mirror, Do You See Yourself as You Really Are or Only Your Appearance?",8,12 October 2010,"Viewed by some as a psychosexual thriller, some as a bitter comedy about how Tom Cruise falls short of getting laid, this is most likely neither, a cerebral film that works on various planes, imaginary, physical, transcendental and everything that falls in between. A hypnotic, thematically perceptive, sumptuously atmospheric, merely every so often bothersome piece, an intensely challenging consideration of the limits of faith, certainty and shared understanding possible between man and woman, Cruise's scenes with Nicole Kidman provide an intimacy hitherto absent from Kubrick's work. From the mirror love scene, played with a carnal sweetness rare for the screen, to the vulnerability and apprehension of their ultimate talk, Cruise and Kidman are frank, emotive, despite that the movie definitely follows Kubrick's thread of mysterious films with emotionally remote characters.Actors are in an remorseless existential whirl. A good performance only tends to happen if they let go. Ironically the yearning to perform well and feel this free expression can trap them into holding on, reserving a corner of their focus so they can monitor and direct their performance, which makes all likelihood for a vibrant, natural performance recede. That's why many actors don't communicate their methods, superstitious about exposing such cavernous ideas to the outside. I think Kubrick was the same way with his technique. And that's why I feel that Cruise and Kidman don't seem like Maverick and Nicola; they mesh in Kubrick's world. They are in synch.Yet the real star of this movie is Kubrick himself, who, precisely in character, gives meticulous heed to each self-contained scene. He makes a conscious decision not to weave them into a progressing narrative, but to make each one an objective in itself, giving each confrontation the ferment of a dream in which the present is lucid but it's difficult to recall where we've come from, project what could come next. It's as close as many films ever come to being pure: It's so intent on what it's about that even logical narrative form isn't allowed to take precedence over what it's about, which is something as basic and universal as a confession of sexual longing. It's purely, yes, a stream of fidelity, jealousy, and dream logic channeled through an array of sub-Freudian motifs.No one acquainted with the distant meticulousness of Kubrick's work will be surprised that this isn't the steamy erotic thriller a synopsis might convey. The eerily stately air of sexual melancholy and claustrophobia which permeates the film finds its focal point during an elaborate masked orgy, which may or may not place Cruise in mortal danger. Yet there's an underlying subtlety to the film which takes care to provide all manner of visual and thematic echoes, accommodating the blurring of perceptual distinctions hinted in the title.Each of these scenes is like an interior monologue-heavy chapter in a novel. They move at a slower pace to allow a more intimate look into Cruise's inner life, for him to digest actions, events and epiphanies, he interacts with himself and the settings more than with other characters, and they never feel time-based. They're thoughts, basically. They're free-floating. Everything's a projection of a feeling or notion. It's a beguiling metaphysical experience of overhearing a person's private thoughts, as they're alternately externalized and internalized.Throughout the shooting of all Kubrick's most important works, he constantly sought the most authentic ambiance or ""feel"" for each, and this personally controlled, visually enticing enterprise has a thriller's framework, with the prospects of intrigue and murder. It also strikes one like an infernal delusion; a sequence of odd characters flicker in and out of the limelight, baffling the hero with obscure fine points of their lives. The compromise at the end of the film is the one scene that doesn't quite come off; a film that captivates us owing to its undecided issues shouldn't attempt to bring in the bubble wrap. But that's why Eyes Wide Shut is a consummate film in its famously headstrong director's canon, because it both classically exemplifies his power as a filmmaker and showcases his weaknesses, which compared to most filmmakers in history are showcases of pure talent.I don't think the point is to be able to pass a test on it when it's over, but to nonetheless become completely absorbed. Implicating the audience in the act of coveting, Kubrick's accomplishment here is sustaining a weird, off-putting, somehow sensual pitch for the doctor's oddball confrontations. Shooting with a grainy high-contrast approach, lots of back-lighting, underlighting and intense primary colors, setting the film at Christmastime to benefit from the lights, he makes it all rather ornate, like an urban festival. Cruise isn't exactly the protagonist but the character being compelled, tilting from one scenario to another.The grace, appearance of impulsiveness continually surprise, invigorate, and the horizontalization of space, emotion cement this banquet of technique, Freudian incisiveness and personal audacity as---despite minor but uncharacteristic compromises by Kubrick to secure a mainstream release---an affront to the Hollywood game, a declaration of its maker's independence. When this came out a few months after Kubrick's death, it was seriously misread, which should've come as no shock. If you retread, examine the initial responses to any Kubrick film, except the earliest ones, you'll see that all of them were. Then, after five, ten years came the dawning that 2001, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon were each like nothing else before or since. So is Eyes Wide Shut.",Eyes Wide Shut
46,videorama-759-859391,This one may open people' s eyes,8,4 January 2014,"I must admit this film, angered me, on it's first viewing. Yes I was disappointed. Though it was engrossing, I expected much much much more. When seeing it again, months later, I enjoyed it a lot more. I should of known, being a Kubrick film, it would be out of the ordinary. I had known about the film since 1995, which took 15 months to make, and had wondered about it's progress. It actually made the Guinness book of records as the longest movie shoot. Kubrick must of really got into Tom and Nic's heads, a director who demands perfection. It doesn't feel that way when watching their performances, Nicole's, better than Tom's. He's average, nothing more. Eyes Wide Shut, is like stepping into a dream. It's one way you can take this film. It opens your eyes up to infidelity, and what makes us tic, and how we can correct our mistakes that would make us avoid cheating. We more so take the journey with Cruise, a doctor pulls an all nighter after making a respectful house call, at the death of a patient. From there he roams the streets. He goes back with a prostitute. He has second thoughts about going ahead with.... you know, but still pays her. Idiot. He wastes money again later, too. He goes to a jazz bar, to meet up with an old uni friend, now a pianist. He's told of this place, a secret, elite club, involving a sex cult, and Tom just has to go. What happens here, changes his life erratically. Eyes Wide Shut, is beautiful movie visually, especially the naked orgy scene, or Tom going off with some hot models, but you have to take it with patience, thus making the journey worthwhile. How the lengthy scenes work at the stories slow telling of 153 minutes, is truly something magical, that blindsided me. I could hardly take my eyes off the screen. Despite what I thought of it not having the best endings, quite a downer, actually, this movie really makes you think. Although it isn't Kubrick's best work and will chafe quite a few, may'be give it another viewing, just to see if it still has a much undesired effect.",Eyes Wide Shut
47,Vartiainen,Dream-like sexual weirdness,9,17 January 2014,"Stanley Kubrick's last film before his death. A film that blurs the borders of dreaming and challenges us to question the differences between reality, dreams, fantasies and nightmares. Sometimes it's just as weird to be awake as it is to dream.Dr. William Harford - played brilliant here by Tom Cruise in a role that might very well be the best he has ever done - flees from his house after hearing a jarring confession from his wife. And thus begins the long night that would haunt him forever.What makes this film so perfect is Kubrick's vision. The pace is so agonizingly slow, the plot so nonsensical, that had it not had one of the best directors of all time at the steering wheel, it would fallen straight to that pile of artsy borefests that only film majors ever watch. But it doesn't. Yes, it's slow, yes it makes no sense whatsoever, but yet it works. I remember glancing at the clock after the film had been going on for a while and I remember asking ""Has it really been two hours already?"" Because it didn't feel like it had. The film is hypnotizing. It pulls you in and as Harford wanders around New York, you remain strangely calm about the whole situation. You don't question, why was that character there, why did that scene happen. It just does, it's cool.Part of that calmness comes from the technical side of this film. Kubrick didn't want to use any studio lighting, so instead the crew relied mostly on the various Christmas decorations that they places strategically all over the sets. This gives the film a slightly blurred, soft and ethereal quality, not unlike if you were dreaming the whole time. The soundtrack is also amazingly powerful, underlining each scene with a heavy hand, but never in a way that feels forced. One of the few films where I noticed the sound cues and didn't hate them.I already praised Tom Cruise, but it's also worth noticing that despite this film having huge piles of gratuitous nudity, despite the infamous orgy scene, despite all these weird sexual situations Harford finds himself in, the sexiest thing in the entire film is his wife (Nicole Kidman) leaning against the doorframe in her nightclothes or peering over her glasses. That's talent on Kidman's part and the fact is helped alone by her and Cruise's marriage at the time. They have fantastic chemistry together and Kidman provides us with the needed reality and anchorage.Pretty much the only thing keeping this film from becoming one of my personal favourites is the fact that the ending drags. Not a huge amount, but it does. At that point the musical cues have begun to grow on your nerves, the slow scenes have slipped back into being agonizing and you just want the film to give you its final words and leave you to ponder its mysteries. Instead we get one final conversation before the ending scene between Cruise and Kidman. It doesn't ruin the film for me, but it's a shame that such a great film falters just before the finish line.Still, it's an amazing film. Heavily sexual, but not in a sexy way, it's a journey like you've never taken before. Riddled with phenomenal acting performances, with fantastic production values, ironhand directing and unforgettable scenes, it's a film you're going to remember. May it haunt your fantasies and deepest nightmares.",Eyes Wide Shut
48,Captain_Couth,The World of Stanley Kubrick: Eyes Wide Shut.,8,30 July 2005,"Eyes Wide Shut (1999) was Stanley Kubrick's final film. This movie probably killed him in the end. He never even got the chance to present a final cut of this film. The production on this film was very lengthy. Reshoots and hundreds of takes were never enough for the man, he wanted perfection (that's what happens when a photographer becomes a film maker). The movie was a very non-commercial one and a lot of post production tinkering was made to get this movie some mainstream acceptance. Kidman and Cruise are brilliant in this film. Fellow director Sidney Pollack shows that he can act as well as direct. Too bad the film was tinkered with in the editing room (get the Hong Kong V.C.D.). Not the movie that I wanted to see Kubrick make before he died (what ever happened to the Aryan Papers and the Napoleon project?)but I guess it'll have to do (like I have a choice). In a way it is fitting for him, making a mainstream movie after all of these years.Recommended for Kubrick fans only.",Eyes Wide Shut
49,thinker1691,The Doctor and the Wife,8,12 July 2006,"Out of the wondrous imaginative mind of Stanley Kubrick comes this erotic tale of successful doctor William Harford (Tom Cruise) who believes he and his beautiful wife (Nicole Kidman) are a modern uninhibited and sophisticated couple. That all changes when the pair pauses a moment in their sedate and upscale life to smoke a joint. The husband reviews their evening at a fancy ball and reveals he was hit on by a couple of gorgeous women, but had the strength and fortitude to resist their invitation and charms. Taking his cue, the wife reveals that she too was invited to a sexual rendezvous and considered it just another of the many flirts she daily encounters. In fact, she further reveals, she's often had several wild fantasies involving herself and a handsome ship's Captain. This awakens and disturbs the doctor who believes there is much more to the sexual world of his wife which he is not privy to. Intrigued by the possibilities, he begins a personal but dangerous Odyssey to discover the dark secret world of the sexually provocative. The question arises. Can one delve into the black depths of perversion without losing himself? Eyes Wide Shut is a spellbinding foray of spectral images, complete with an equally haunting theme. All in all, a strange but alluring film where one discovers that enlightenment comes not without a price. ****",Eyes Wide Shut
50,freemantle_uk,Kubrick's Swan Song,8,6 August 2009,"Stanley Kubrick is a legend of film making, making classics such as The Killing, Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket. He is easily my favourite director and Eyes Wide Shut is the last film he ever made.Set in New York Dr. Bill Hartford and Alice (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) are upper class members of society in an unhappy marriage. During a party both end up flirting with other people until Bill has to treat a woman who has a bad reaction to speedball. The following night during an attempted night of passion and smoking weed Alice relieves she nearly had an affair, which Bill off the edge. He looks to get his own back, first finding an prostitute before running to an old university friend who tells him of a special event that he plays the piano at, taking part in strange ritual. Bill sneaks in the event, and finds that it sex ritual. It is an orgy, but one of the women tries to warn Bill and he found out. After the orgy Bill becomes paranoid, fears he is being followed and that these people would attack his family and suffers guilt from the events.Kubrick flair's for direction is shown once again. He tells a story extremely well, keeping your focus on the screen, unfolds the story gradually and keeps the mystery going. Kubrick is a very thematic director, as shown in his previous films. This time the themes are obsession and sex (similar to Lolita), the breakdown of marriage and the look at high society. There are small plot points, like the young girl sleeping with two older men, which add to film. Kubrick is magical behind the camera, filming some lovely shots, knowing exactly what the audience should focus on. He pays attention to detail, and has a love for tracking shots. He rarely has a need to make cuts, preferring to keep the film flowing.But this film does have weaknesses. The weakest is the acting from the leads. Nicole Kidman is schizophrenic in performance, being wooden for the most time, but did have moments of brilliance. Tom Cruise is normally a good actor and he was better then his then-wife, but this is not his strongest performance in his career. I can picture that Cruise did this project thinking he can win an Oscar. It is believed that Eyes Wide Shut lead to their break up. Luckily the supporting cast for this film was good. The other major problem with this film is the pacing, being a bit too slow at times. There are some very long scenes in this film. But Kubrick is a man who knew what he was doing.Kubrick is an artist. Eyes Wide Shut is his weakest film, but if this Kubrick at his worst, you can imagine what Kubrick was like at his best.A film for Kubrick purists like me.",Eyes Wide Shut

Yeah. I'd confidently say that that, pretty much, describes this piffling, snivelling, nothing-of-a-move to an absolute ""T"".And, speaking about this being director Kubrick's last picture (made at the absolute end of his life) - What an utterly sad and pathetic whimper-of-a-movie ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was. Yeah. It sure was.Instead of Kubrick's career and life going out with a colossal ""bang!' here - This final film of his was such a totally forgettable and worthless offering that all I can honestly think of to say in response to it is - ""Tsk. Tsk. To Stanley Kubrick.... Yeah. Shame-shame on you Stanley. You really let me down, man!"" And, of course, casting those 2 totally talentless stars, Cruise and Kidman, as this film's lead characters was, without a doubt, the straw that broke this movie's back. There's no question about that.",Eyes Wide Shut
52,dfranzen70,"Kubrick's final film uneven and, apparently, unfinished",3,11 March 2000,"Many critics praised this film as the crowning achievement in Stanley Kubrick's long and illustrious career. Many critics are also full of deer feces. Seriously, I can't imagine people actually thinking this is an incredible movie - unless they're in awe of Kubrick, who brought to the world many magnificent films, including ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Barry Lyndon,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and ""Paths of Glory."" Kubrick is indeed an auteur, but here he missed the boat. The late director, who also served as screenwriter, gives us a 2.5-hour piece of slop, as we follow Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) through a series of curious, if not altogether interesting, experiences. First he and Mrs. Dr. Bill (Nicole Kidman) go to a lavish party where each is kinda tempted to cheat on the other, but doesn't. Then they discuss it later and typical marital understanding ensues. Yes, you can almost recite the lines before they happen in that scene, folks. Angry, Bill leaves his wife, runs into a cheap (and, apparently, kind-hearted, JUST the kind of prostitute that's on the streets today, one can easily imagine) hooker, goes to a jazz club, and finally goes to a masquerade-cum-orgy ball. The first problem hits you right away. For a couple who are married in real life, Kidman and Cruise have zero chemistry in this film. They don't play off each other well at all, and even the mild sex scenes are real yawners. Beyond that is the script itself. One gets the impression that Kubrick had a much more developed movie in mind, but when he died the studio just released whatever was lying around. The script could have been so intriguing! The main problem with it is that is simply doesn't follow through on any premises. When a small storyline is introduced, it's just left after that brief introduction. And folks, when we're talking about a 159-minute movie, that's not easy to do. Which brings me to the last big problem of the movie. Every actor talks..... really...... slowly. Don't ask me why. And since Kubrick declined to use much in the way of background music (except for one annoyingly repetitive riff, meant to portend great ominence or something), the pauses between syllables are even more prolonged. So what we're left with is overblown, overstated, pretentious piffle. It's almost as if the auteur took bits of every art-house smash he'd ever scene and thrown them into a Cuisinart. Problem is the product is a gooey concoction of superficial gunk.",Eyes Wide Shut
53,ackstasis,"""I have seen one or two things in my life but never, never anything like this.""",8,26 January 2007,"'Eyes Wide Shut,' the long-awaited final film from visionary director Stanley Kubrick was released in 1999, shortly after Kubrick's sad and unfortunate death. Many predicted that it would be Kubrick's masterpiece - the film by which he would inevitably be remembered. It isn't, but 'Eyes Wide Shut' remains a stunning film, and nothing less than we've come to expect from this master director.Tom Cruise (""Minority Report"") is Dr. William ""Bill"" Harford, a handsome and successful young doctor, who is happily married to Alice (Nicole Kidman, ""The Others"") with one young daughter, Helena. Bill is loyal to Alice, and he expects the same in return. However, he is severely shocked one night when Alice confesses that, a year earlier, she'd seriously contemplated having an affair with a young Navy officer.Many have complained about the slow pace of 'Eyes Wide Shut.' I didn't find anything negative about it. The slow, meditative pace of the film (which shouldn't come as a surprise to fans of Kubrick's spectacular ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") gave the film its entire, dream-like quality, and I was simply transfixed to the screen the whole time. The scene where a masked Bill Harford wanders into the mysterious mansion amidst a secret sex ritual is simpling mesmerising, with no small thanks to the great direction from Kubrick. Once again, as always, he's chosen the perfect music to capture the atmosphere of the scene!The only scenes where I thought the film slipped up were a couple of the later mansion scenes, when the mysterious woman was warning Cruise to get out of there. The bit where she said, ""You are in grave danger!"" sounded a bit melodramatic (reminded me of 'The Da Vinci Code,' actually), and also when she interrupts Cruise's stern interrogation by yelling, ""STOP!"" The quick zoom used in that moment made me laugh...However, an astute fellow IMDb user alerted me to the fact that perhaps Kubrick did this deliberately. The actress in that scene (the mask prevents me from remembering who she actually was) sounded like she was acting because, simply put, her character was just acting. The entire display, as Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack) suggests later in the film, may have been an elaborate ploy to scare the wits through Harford. Not being an experienced actor, the woman may have been convincing enough for the terrified and confused Harford, but not necessarily for the astute film viewer sitting in the comfort of their home. Though it is impossible to understand entirely what Kubrick was attempting with that scene, it seems like the sort of thing he'd do!'Eyes Wide Shut' contains great performances from a talented cast. I thought that Tom Cruise shined in the main role, translating the fear and confusion of his character to the screen beautifully. Nicole Kidman was also very good  her slow, brooding delivery of dialogue certainly contributed to the dreamlike quality of the film.This is a quality film from one of the all-time greats of film-making. Often overlooked simply as ""Stanley Kubrick's last film,"" 'Eyes Wide Shut' deserves to be seen and appreciated by more film-goers.",Eyes Wide Shut

But if you are into craftsmanship, creativeness, visuals, design, and symbolism in moviemaking then this is the film for you.

Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman deliver Oscar-worthy performances. Also, co-star Sydney Pollack stands firm with his too. This Kubrick masterpiece contains the most mesmerizing scene of the year. It will definitely excite you in more ways than one! The elegant but sometimes mysterious music in the film is one of its best assets.

55,MaxBorg89,"Kubrick's final masterwork: a haunting, compelling nightmare",10,27 July 2007,"Due to the advertising and rumors surrounding the plot (not to mention the stunt-casting of real-life husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as the central married couple) most people expected this film, Stanley Kubrick's last picture, to be an explicit story of sex and adultery. I expected it too, to be honest. I couldn't have been more wrong: Eyes Wide Shut is one of the coldest, most unsettling studies of love and betrayal ever made, one that acquires new meanings as the years go by.Set in New York (but actually shot in London), the film's bizarre chain of events starts at a party, a typical Kubrickian context, where Dr. Bill Harford (Cruise) and his spouse Alice (Kidman) are among the guests. While his wife elegantly tells a suitor to get lost, Bill is asked to help the host (played with eerie charm by Sydney Pollack) revive a naked girl who has accidentally OD:d in a bathroom. Though visibly shocked by these events, the physician returns home and calmly follows his usual routine. One night, however, an argument between him and Alice leads to the latter revealing she fantasized about sleeping with another man during a holiday. Stunned by the cruelly honest confession, Bill leaves the house and spends the rest of the night wandering around, the image of his wife having an affair prompting him to seek revenge: at first he considers having sex with a prostitute, then he decides to attend a party a friend told him about, only to run into something bigger than imagined and almost risk his life.Superficially, Eyes Wide Shut can be considered a sex film, but it is in fact much deeper: with only one actual ""sex"" scene (apart from the infamous orgy sequence and Bill's visions) in the whole movie, the focus is more on what love and commitment imply and demand. Naturally, being this a Kubrick film, no happiness should be expected: so chilling it actually makes Mike Nichols' Closer look like a comedy, EWS leaves no room for comfort or relief, the cynical closing line being the definitive punch in the stomach for anyone hoping things would go differently.Moreover, the wonderfully strange title suggests this movie might be the one that most reflects the director's view on cinema: film is like a dream. In this case, it is a frightening nightmare, and even though there are clues that seem to prove Bill's harrowing experience took place in his mind alone the ghostly atmosphere never leaves.Scariest of all, though, are the fearless anti-performances Cruise and Kidman deliver: combining the original script with whatever problems they might have had at the time (one should keep in mind their divorce was finalized less than two years after the movie's release), they expose the darkest sides of marriage with a brutal sincerity that clearly indicates there is no, or very little, acting involved. And while Cruise used his role and that of Frank Mackey in Magnolia (his best work to date) to prove he could handle more difficult characters, Kidman's surprisingly raw portrayal of disappointment and secret lust was the first of many parts (Moulin Rouge!, The Hours and Dogville in particular) that showed the world she was actually a great actress and not just the Top Gun star's wife.With its layered thematic content, expert execution and brave cast, Eyes Wide Shut is a fascinating last film from one of cinema's undisputed masters, and like all other Kubrick pictures it repays repeated viewings like few are able to. A little warning, nevertheless: it is not recommended if you get nightmares easily.",Eyes Wide Shut
56,smatysia,Enigmatic,8,15 July 2002,"Okay, it shouldn't come as a great surprise that a Kubrick film might be, shall we say, deliberate in pace. Or that it might end up being, um, enigmatic. Nicole Kidman is awesome in this role, even more so, in that her character is not one that we really like all that much. A lot was left unsaid. Tom Cruise plays the quintessential ""nice guy"" and like them, he tends to lose. It is a bit amusing that, as he goes out to seek revenge on his wife for her sexual fantasy, he never quite manages to get laid. Sydney Pollack's character provides some exposition at the end, but one doesn't really know whether to believe him, just as Cruise's character doesn't know. There are some large mysteries, which I would have called plot holes in someone else's movie, such as how the woman recognized Cruise to warn him, through his Venetian mask. That whole sequence had such a dreamlike, nightmarish quality about it that I can see how someone may think that entire part of the film is really a dream. Plus Alice (Kidman) made some comments at the end that might make one think so. I'm not so sure. The return of the mask is completely unexplained, and so it up to the viewer to interpret. The creepy piano music fit the film perfectly, and the photography was always very bright, odd for a film that one might consider as basically dark. I need to see the film another time or two to really see what I think of it. But for now, Grade: A",Eyes Wide Shut

Alice is invited with her husband Dr. William (Tom Cruise) to a holiday party given by a New York wealthy broker called Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack).While Alice is dancing half-drunk with an effusive Hungarian (Ski Dumont), she was, at the same time, spying on her husband who was flirting with two models...

He made a film about the conception of sex... He wanted us to explore something inside our mind that we usually prefer not to discover... Through his eyes a visual work appeared, a cinematic technique breathtakingly beautiful, a perfectionism, precise and mystical...Reducing the dialog to a minimum, and with a distinguished confused music, we were in presence of a strange ceremonial rite, a picturesque ritual...Based on a psychological drama, written by the Viennese novelist Arthur Schnizler, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a mirror, audaciously obsessive in its dazzling revelations, profound, provocative and passionate, transmitted in a frame of sex, fear and death, that we have to see with wide eyes fully opened...",Eyes Wide Shut

59,MissSimonetta,Hardly worthy of the scorn still heaped on it,9,22 April 2016,"Having only been a little girl in 1999, I was not aware of the sheer disdain heaped upon this film. Many of the people I know who were old enough to remember its release only wrinkled their noses when I expressed my interest in watching it. My film professor (who admittedly is not a Kubrick fan anyway) claimed it was too bizarre for him and that he barely knew anyone who even liked it. My mother (who has never even seen it) claimed the critics ""hated it at the time"" and that ""the sex scenes are supposed to be boring and the plot looks stu-pid!"" Many on IMDb have already expressed their boredom and estrangement. Nevertheless I went in with an open mind.Eyes Wide Shut (1999) is nothing but a masterpiece; maybe not the best of Kubrick's films, but a gem in his oeuvre nevertheless. If you are looking for smut or an erotic thriller, then this is not for you. Eyes Wide Shut is more interested in examining the link between sex, love, and fidelity than supplying smutty material in any form. The sex and nudity in particular are portrayed in the coldest, most clinical manner, so hardly any of it is arousing anyway. The whole films is uncomfortable yes; the hazy colors and moody score often lend it the feel of a strange, slow nightmare.Like A Clockwork Orange or 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film brings up big questions about the human condition and never supplies answers. I was not even sure if Bill and Alice's marriage would even survive for much longer by the end of the film. The ambiguity is just brilliant. It's the kind of movie that will have you discussing it for a long time afterward, long after lesser movies have been forgotten. By the time the credits were finished, I was left with a great sense of sadness because after this, we have no more Stanley Kubrick films to look forward to. What a tragedy for film lovers!

This last movie by Stanley Kubrick is not perfect, but makes you think while it takes you through one couple's warped experiences after the wife reveals that she was thinking about being with another man sexually during a very important point in their relationship(the couple's engagement). The man, played by Tom Cruise, then has a night where he encounters a prostitute and then a weird sexual cult. He never is unfaithful – just as the wife isn't – but these occurrences in many cases would still split couples up eventually. The deception that Cruise's character has to go through is almost a bigger sin then his encounters and the wife, played by Nicole Kidman brilliantly in a unique part for her, kind of pays for her blatant honesty. The pacing is definitely Kubrick-like(slow and methodical) and not for everyone, and some of the scenes don't make sense -- but overall this is a compelling probe into human sexual existence and how male and females play with it – almost to our own destruction.",Eyes Wide Shut
61,davispittman,A film exploring marriage with some flaws,7,18 January 2016,"Eyes wide shut certainly is a peculiar movie, but it's intriguing, which is the main reason I watched it one night. This movie does feature very good performances by the lead actors, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. I was very impressed by their performances. The plot of the movie is kinda hard to explain, basically it's about Tom Cruise's character's one night exploration of himself and of moral and sexual discoveries after his wife, played by Nicole's character tells him that one time she came close and considered cheating on him. So as you can probably imagine, you're in for very intense, graphic sexual content and a lot of male and female nudity (both rear and full frontal). So if that sort of thing offends you, then stay away, Cus it's in this film for sure! Personally, it didn't bother me a whole whole lot, but in a couple of scenes it got to be just a little much. Now the movie's script is well written and intelligent, that was nice to see. In my opinion, Tom Cruise was the best part of this film, his performance was gripping, and he sure did look good doing it lol, but seriously, he was awesome here! And Nicole gave one of her best performances ever in this film, she was so real and dramatic! Stanley Kubrick did do a pretty good job with this movie, it was shot beautifully, and intelligently. I appreciate this film's intelligence, you can sure tell that a lot of hard work went into the making of this film. This movie is very psychological and interesting to watch. It ultimately is just about tom and Nicole's marriage and about why she considered cheating on him, and how tom gets through it and how he deals with it. I would have preferred less nudity and a little less sex, that would've been nice. I'm perfectly alright with having some female/male nudity, and I'm alright with sex scenes, as long as they aren't like porn. I just feel like In a couple scenes the amount of sex/nudity sort of took away from the main objective of the movie and in a way distracted the audience. And the ending to Eyes Wide Shut is in my humble opinion one of the greatest endings in cinema history, it's so well acted, and well written, and it's refreshing to see how they resolved everything, it's a true testament to the word marriage. This is a good film for married couples to see, but you might wanna zip through one scene or 2, just because as I said previously, the amount of nudity can be a little distracting. 7/10 overall for Eyes Wide Shut.",Eyes Wide Shut
62,hu675,One of the most fascinating films from the late Stanley Kubrick.,9,26 August 2005,"Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise), a New Yorker who goes out one fateful winter night into an erotic foray that threatens his marriage. Dr. Harford may even bring him in a bizarre murder mystery. After his wife (Cruise's ex-wife and Oscar-Winner:Nicole Kidman) admits her sexual longings. Dr. Harford goes from doubt, fear to self-discovery and reconciliation.Directed by the late-Stanley Kubrick (2001:A Space Odyssey, Full Metal Jacket, The Shining) made his last film. The film is long and flawed but better than some of his previous film. The movie is vivid and unforgettable. Cruise and Kidman are excellent. The film has an sharp supporting cast like Filmmaker:Sydney Pollack, Marie Richardson, Todd Field, Thomas Gibson, Vanessa Shaw, Rade Sherbedgia, Leelee Sobieski, Alan Cummuing & Fay Masterson.DVD has an sharp Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an fine-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has the theatrical trailer and interviews with Cruise, Kidman and Oscar-Winner Filmmaker:Steven Spielberg. The film is about the world of sexual adventure for one night for Cruise's character. This is a provocative film with Kubrick's unique environment. The film is contained and claustrophobic at times but never boring. One of the best films of 1999. Based on a novel titled ""Tramnoville"" by Arthur Schnitzler. Screenplay by the director and Frederic Raphael. (**** ½/*****).",Eyes Wide Shut

The storyline is amazing it's one of the best mystery stories I've ever seen and it also manages to have brilliant character study. Bill is such an interesting character, a lot of his motivations and actions can be analyzed whether the way he felt about everything.

Even more surprising was how closely the story follows the original 1926 Austrian novel it is based on. There are some great performances in this movie, the best probably being Sydney Pollack. I remember people in the audience getting really mad at Nicole Kidman's character for her honest revelations. I believe the whole point of the movie is to look at how a couple can deal with infidelity. The soundtrack stands out as well. It's not one I watch back much, but I enjoy it all the way through.",Eyes Wide Shut
65,alansabljakovic-39044,Cruise is from another planet,8,21 October 2018,Unexpected mystery movie with great cast. I didn't read anything about the movie so I was surprised of the way it went.

66,Agent10,Icey Eroticism from the mind of Kubrick,8,8 August 2002,"Stanley Kubrick's last film proved to be one of his chilliest. While some might label the erotica in the film as hot and steamy, Kubrick managed to make naked women and animal lust feel cold and isolated. From the opening cut to the last line uttered by Nicole Kidman, this will be one of those films that will be simply labeled a `Kubrick film.' While it saddens me to think this was his last film, at least I got to watch this one in a theater. With the exception of this film and Full Metal Jacket, I have never seen any of Kubrick's previous film in a larger than life fashion. While the pacing was a little slow, even for Kubrick, I really felt the dialogue was strange and unique. Coupled with some great camera movements and music, everything is put together evenly over the run of the film. It may have been a long two and half year wait, but at least Kubrick's swan song isn't something to be completely embarrassed about.",Eyes Wide Shut
67,Jonny_Numb,"Not surprisingly, Kubrick continues to herd sheep from the grave...",5,28 June 2003,"After over a year of production, Stanley Kubrick came up with a final bone to throw at the slobbering sycophants--er, FANS--who elevated him to a godlike position among filmmakers.  With ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" the director's sterile, detached style reaches an unfathomable low, as he literally sucks potential vigor and excitement out of his own movie during its 159-minute transfusion.  Therefore it is hard to blame the actors for the film's lack of importance (and interest)--neither Tom Cruise nor Nicole Kidman can feign drunkenness (or other highs) convincingly, and their performance as husband and wife feels uncomfortably self-conscious.  It doesn't speak too well for Kubrick when his best-staged scenes involve Alan Cumming and Sydney Pollack embarking on expositionary monologues when he gets bored with ogling his bland stars.  The director's death only helped fuel the hype about ""Eyes,"" but the perceptive viewer won't find much to get excited over--every inch of the female anatomy is lovingly examined during the much-ballyhooed orgy scene, yet is drawn-out, numbing, and base compared to something like ""Blue Velvet"" or ""Crash.""  The pretext for Cruise's descent into the baroque sexual underworld--Kidman's admission of an 'erotic' daydream--is rather improbable, resulting in a weak payoff in the last act.  Granted, there are some moments that hooked me in, but the trance was only fragmentary.  To many, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was interpreted as a fitting epitaph for a great director--to me, it just amplified an overrated one.4.5/10",Eyes Wide Shut
68,ShootingShark,"Annoying, Frustrating, Brilliant, Lurid, One-Of-A-Kind Sex Drama",6,7 May 2006,"Bill Harford is a well-to-do New York City doctor with a young family. After attending a party, he and his wife Alice have a row about infidelity and he is called out on business. During a strange night he is tempted to be unfaithful with both the daughter of a patient and a hooker, and gains admittance to a bizarre orgy at an out-of-town mansion. Scarred and vulnerable by the experiences, can he and Alice regain each other's love and trust ?This is a tough movie for me to review. My admiration of Kubrick is boundless; he was an incomparable genius of film-making, a man who was peerless technically and the only director who never compromised on anything, ever. Unfortunately, he made two lemons in his career - Barry Lyndon and Eyes Wide Shut. Okay, that's unfair. I say they're lemons but by just about any other director's standards they would be their greatest work. And they are stunning films on several levels, but for me the subject-matter of both of them - sex and immorality - is turgid and uninteresting. Eyes Wide Shut is based on a dreary book called Traumnouvelle by Arthur Schnitzler, one of those early-twentieth century psychosexual writers who managed to gain acclaim by writing shock value prose with the fashionable Freudian conceits of the day. My summation of the plot of the movie above isn't really a summation, that is the whole story, in eighty words. All that leaves the two-and-a-half-hour movie with is characterisation (which there isn't much of either) and technique (which there is lots of). And so, like Barry Lyndon, it becomes a cold, beautiful film, like a Cartier diamond - rare, hypnotic and dazzling to look at, but ultimately uninvolving and flat. There are about twenty shots of Cruise walking down corridors in this movie, all of which are filmed with a master's perfection, but none of which really advance the story or tell us about the characters. There is fabulous low-key lighting, incredibly unsettling music by Jocelyn Pook, and marvellous editing, but the narrative is so slight it beggars belief. It's almost as if Kubrick set himself the challenge of taking a boring, threadbare book and transforming it into a fascinating, profound film; he succeeded, but it doesn't change the fact that the story is rubbish. It's also a movie where the style does not suit the material. The best scene is the big argument between Bill and Alice, which is shot close and feels very authentic, like a John Cassavetes drama. This, and other scenes, are completely at odds with the extremely stylised orgy section in the middle, which is vaguely risible, almost like a scene from a cheap horror flick about witchcraft. I think it's very difficult not to make people having sex on screen look comical and that wrecks the ooh-this-a-powerful-clique-of-debauched-sinners atmosphere the film is trying to create. Also, the ending is incredibly unsatisfying, a double-whammy of lameness, again entirely down to the plotting; not only do we not find out whether the hooker Mandy's death was an accident or something sinister, but Bill and Alice resolve their monumental differences with a few throwaway platitudes. Oh, and the title's stupid too. Okay, I'm probably whaling on this movie unfairly, but it's a thorn in my side. Kubrick was a genius, an absolute untouchable genius, but he took forever to make movies (five in thirty years) so when he picked this material I was incredibly disappointed and tragically he died of a heart attack literally days after finishing the final cut, so Eyes Wide Shut became his epitaph (as opposed to, for example, a much more interesting project he was working on, AI Artificial Intelligence, subsequently made by Steven Spielberg in 2001). What can I say that's good about Eyes Wide Shut ? It has some nice performances - I admire the way Cruise throws himself into the thankless role of Bill, a man questioning his morality but who lacks the courage to fulfill his fantasies, constantly trudging down hallways and streets and repeating the questions others have asked him. Both he and Kidman (who were married at the time) became grown-up actors as a consequence of making this film, and particularly in her case have gone on to challenging dramatic roles. I also like both Davis and Shaw as the two hookers, one high-class, one not, both of whom manage to make interesting women without much script to work from, and Kubrick's longtime assistant Leon Vitali plays the bizarre Red Cloak. For trivia buffs, the movie's production was the usual Kubrick litany of insane secretive meticulousness; despite the fact that numerous scenes take place on the streets of NYC, it was all shot on huge stages at Pinewood, the schedule was over a year long (probably a record), with Kubrick's usual one-hundred-takes-of-everything please ethic. Most notably, Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh were both original cast members, but Kubrick eventually fired Keitel and Leigh had other commitments and couldn't reshoot. How can I sum up ? This is a bad movie you have to see. Its faults lie in the story and script, but it has so many other interesting facets to it and it's such a unique nutty sex drama, it has to be experienced. However, don't judge Stan The Man by this film - check out Dr Strangelove (incredible), 2001: A Space Odyssey (mesmerising), A Clockwork Orange (astonishing), The Shining (terrifying) or Full Metal Jacket (stunning) to see the real genius of this master filmmaker.",Eyes Wide Shut
69,truemythmedia,Kubrick's Last Song,8,14 June 2019,"I don't hate this film, but I certainly don't love it either. As far as craft, it's great. As far as story, it's fine. Some scenes worked better than others, some acting suffers a bit, and overall, I still think this film could've been twenty minutes shorter and we would've gotten the same message. Then again, who am I to tell Kubrick how to do his job? He's a director that has crafted some of the most brilliant films of his time, this one just doesn't work as well as others (it's still better than 90% of the movies I see today, which is why it still earns a 4 star rating from me). A bittersweet note for Kubrick to leave on, but as said in this film; ""life goes on, until it doesn't, but you know that, don't you?""",Eyes Wide Shut
70,Samiam3,despite the ending it qualifies as an achievement,8,7 March 2010,"Considering his mise-en-scene, I like to think of Kubrick as a neo-expressionist. Eyes Wide Shut however embodies that and more. There is a dose of surrealism to this, in part because when all is said and done, the film makes no sense, which is frustrating because otherwise it would've been perfect. Like all Kubrick films, this one shows an exceptional knowledge of modern art. It is theatrical and haunting, sometimes a little too much so, which leads to a case of Overacting, also typical of Kubrick.The real problem with Eyes wide shut however is simply the last twenty minutes. Anti climactic, abrupt and does a terrible job of explaining what it attempts to, which results in the film ending on what seems like a random, almost lame note. Up till that point Eyes Wide Shut, is a near cinema sensation of modern film, and one that bookends the career of one of histories greatest auteurs.",Eyes Wide Shut
71,davidmvining,An underrated exploration of dreams,10,26 November 2019,"This might be the best approximation to the experience of a dream in film. Dreams are hard to realize because they don't follow a lot of the basic rules of logic and storytelling we're used to. The only other movie I can think of that works this successfully at building the illogic of a dream is Dario Argento's Suspiria.Bill Harford is a doctor in Manhattan whose clientele includes some very rich people. One of these millionaires, Victor, invites him and his wife Alice to a swanky Christmas party in Victor's large Manhattan mansion. There both husband and wife are presented with opportunities for infidelity. Bill is approached by two models who instantly try to seduce him, dragging him away from the party with implied promises of a threesome while Alice dances with a charming older Hungarian man who makes it very plain that he wants to sleep with her. Alice, despite her drunken state, turns him down, but Bill seems to be on the edge of saying yes (or possibly no) when he's pulled away by Victor's man to deal with a crisis. Victor had taken a prostitute upstairs who took a bad combination of heroin and cocaine before passing out. Bill coaxes her back to the land of the living in a very professional manner, taking seemingly no notice of the attractive body before him.The next night, Bill and Alice put their daughter to bed and get a little high. Alice goes on a tirade about Bill's view of women and sexuality, attacking his preconceived notions of the depths of her fidelity to him when she reveals a fantasy she had about an attractive naval officer the year before. He receives a call about a patient who just died and uses the excuse to leave the house. Consumed with images dancing in his head of Alice romping with the officer, Bill starts a journey that extends well into the night that puts him up against several different forms of temptation.First is the grieving daughter, engaged to another man, who throws herself at Bill in the midst of her sadness. He's there in his professional capacity and lets her down gently. Second is a streetwalker who gets Bill into her apartment with the understanding that he's going to pay her $150 for sex. A call from Alice on Bill's cell phone ends his desire for the romp, he pays the girl for her time, and leaves without more than a chaste kiss. Bill then runs into an old friend, Nick Nightingale, who is a jazz pianist and tells Bill about some crazy shindig he's got lined up in a couple of hours. Bill just has to follow, which he does after he procures a tuxedo, cloak, and mask from a closed costume shop.The shindig is the famous orgy in the house. What fascinates me most about this isn't the orgy itself, it's the fact that it comes in just about halfway through the movie and that the orgy itself is so cloaked in ritual as to border on the profane. Okay, it doesn't border on the profane, it reaches out and grabs the profane with both hands and squeezes as tightly as possible. The music is from a mass played backwards, even. The other part of the ritualistic nature of the orgy is the masks. They never come off and we often seen people kissing each other through the masks. The act of sex is an intimate act, but the masks strip the intimacy completely. Bill's journey has gone from his wife, to someone he knows, to a prostitute, to completely anonymous sex. It's a descent through sex in its different forms until it's nothing more than ritualized and animalistic. Bill gets found out, embarrassed, threatened, and let go after one of the women sacrifices herself to protect him. At home, Alice feeds Bill's sense of jealousy by detailing a dream he just woke her from where she was having sex with a multitude of other men in front of him, mirroring the orgy he just witnessed to a certain degree.The next day, Bill tries to reclaim the images from the night. It's like he's trying to reconstitute a dream after he's waken up. He tries to find Nick, but he's missing and the hotel clerk tells a strange story of Nick getting forcefully led away. He returns the cloak and tuxedo (having lost the mask) to find that the raucous scene he had interrupted the night before is now calm. He tries to find the prostitute only to discover that she's left and her roommate lets him know that she had just that morning received blood test results that showed her to be HIV+. He then goes back out to the mansion where the orgy took place and receives a written threat to stay away.That night, he reads of the death of a beauty queen and uses his status as a doctor to look at her corpse, the thought that she is the woman who saved him at the orgy dancing in his head. She was masked, so he can't quite identify her, but he obviously thinks it's her. He then gets called to Victor who lays out that he knows about Bill at the orgy, for he was there as well. He goes back and forth about whether the threats to Bill's life were real, offering different takes on Nick's disappearance and the woman's death than Bill had come up with. Nothing can be verified, so I don't know how much to trust him, but Bill leaves Victor's and his dream ultimately comes to an end. He finds his missing mask from the orgy resting on his pillow next to Alice and he breaks down. He tells her everything of his journey, she's obviously deeply wounded by it, and they decide to try and continue on with the memory of their near infidelities and temptations behind them instead of in front of them.The Odyssean journey that Bill goes through, as I wrote before, seems to wonderfully capture the logic of a dream. Every stage of a long dream has its own internal logic. The centerpiece for that kind of logic is the costume shop to me. It starts normally with Bill talking through an intercom to the owner of the shop only to find out that it's not whom he expects. The man is shaggy bearded with a long robe and lets him into the place that's darkly lit and filled with mannequins demonstrating certain costumes (this being a Kubrick film, the costumes are mostly of the Napoleonic era). Then the rules of the encounter change when a bump introduces a new element, two Japanese men romping with the costumer's underaged daughter. The costumer locks up the Japanese men and then proceeds with the transaction, getting Bill his tux, cloak, and mask. It's such a weird progression of events and it captures rather perfectly that effervescent feeling of the dream world.On top of that feel we have a fascinating exploration of the intersection of love and lust. Where does trust end within an established relationship. Bill and Alice have been married for nine years. Should they be comfortable with that fact or should they still worry about not only their spouse's fidelity but their own in the face of a sea of temptations? Bill walks through literal orgies and comes out without having succumbed to temptation, but was presenting himself with the temptation to begin with damaging to the relationship he has with Alice? She sure does seem broken up by it when he admits to it. It's a wonderful exploration that leaves with a sense of hope that things may just end up working out.The movie is as well really well filmed. Kubrick continues using his Steadicam in much the same way that he did in The Shining, implying an other world that doesn't conform to the rules of our own. A small side note, but there's a small bit in the movie Filmworker about Leon Vitali, Kubrick's personal assistant, where Vitali describes one of Kubrick's outbursts and he used the example of lens flares in Eyes Wide Shut. I think I saw all of them this time through after seeing Vitali mention it.But yeah, I find the movie completely enrapturing. It's a descent into dream logic and another world while also touching on themes that are extraordinarily grounded. I think it's an underrated work from one of the greatest of filmmakers.",Eyes Wide Shut
72,Spleen,"Compared to ""2001"" ...",10,11 August 1999,"I was reminded of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in a number of ways.  Both it and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" are indescribably, wallowingly, gloriously slow.  But whereas ""2001"" made an immediate impact, and all but clubbed me over the head while I was watching it, I felt as if ""Eyes Wide Shut"" gently tapped me on the shoulder - and THEN clubbed me on the head, an hour or two after I left the cinema.  Maybe it's the movie, maybe my reflexes have decayed. Whatever: my opinion of the movie has been steadily rising since I finished watching it.I'm going to run with the comparison for a bit.  In both films it's ambiguous - or it appears to be ambiguous at first - exactly what happens. But whereas ""2001"" has a ""what the hell just happened?"" kind of ambiguity, there are exactly two obvious ways of interpreting what happened in ""Eyes Wide Shut"", one of which, I think, is determinately right, and the other wrong.  It all hinges on how seriously you take the title, ""Eyes Wide Shut"". (There.  Let anyone who hasn't seen the movie try to get some meaning out of THAT.)Both films have a key moment of terror.  The moment in ""2001"" occurs when something goes alarmingly wrong way out beyond the orbit of Mars.  The feel of ""Eyes Wide Shut"", the sense we get that the central character is miles away from society and beyond all help, is quite similar.  Somehow the terror is much greater in ""2001"".  But terror gives way to something else in ""2001"", whereas here Kubrick manages to keep up the quiet fear in subsequent, seemingly innocent, scenes.In both films Kubrick's use of music is something else again to that of people who plaster bits of Sibelius or Beethoven or Puccini or whoever over scenes in their films because they think it sounds good.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" made me hum Shostakovich to myself on the way home, but that's not what I mean.  More importantly I get the impression that Kubrick has looked at every piece of music ever written and chosen exactly the right one to fit in with his story, whatever musical territory he had to explore in order to get it.  (Normally I wouldn't listen to Ligeti in a pink fit - but try to imagine ""2001"" or ""Eyes Wide Shut"" without him.)I do side with those people who describe the opening scenes as too slow. Sort of, anyway.  Kubrick is merely adopting the pace - surely it's the right pace - he will stick to throughout; so it's not sloth that's the problem.  Rather, we're not being fed enough of immediate interest in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (this is in stark contrast to ""2001"") to get us through the scenes the first time round.  I think this IS a defect.  (Of a sort.)I can understand that there are people who dislike ""Eyes Wide Shut"", but it's futile to deny that it's very good.  We haven't been given very many Kubrick films since about 1960, and this is the last.  If you miss this one you'll probably regret it.",Eyes Wide Shut
73,Amyth47,"Overhyped, empty and extremely disappointing!",1,6 October 2018,My Rating : 1/10One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have no idea why Kubrick and the Producers went ahead with this garbage. This is far too minimal in substance and doesn't warrant a 400-day long shooting schedule and nearly 70 million dollars to make on top of underutilising the talent of Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise.Avoid at all cost.,Eyes Wide Shut
74,Blueghost,"""Stanley Kubrick made one film too many...""",2,9 February 2012,"Sayeth the sandwich maker who worked at the corner deli run by Koreans. And you know what? Dude was right.I don't get affairs. Nor ritualized sex. And apparently neither did Kubrick when he made this film. To me this film is one made by a man who had too much cinematic power, and was probably trying to stay on top of the burgeoning ""adult video"" market that was becoming more accessible to mainstream America by virtue of net commerce.It's well shot, of that there is no doubt. Technical marks all hit their cues, and are right on target. But the story itself? Wow. Pretty vapid stuff if you ask me.I think the problem here is that the question of why do people have affairs is pretty straight forward. People have sexual interests in one another, and sometimes if they're married they're willing to take their chances on breaking a legal bond with their spouse. There's not much more to it than that. It's part of why women put men through so many test during courtship.I think Kubrick, and perhaps a good portion of cuckolds or non-sexually active society are tantalized and interested in sex, so this movie was made.Me, I haven't laughed so hard at certain points in the film since ""Used Cars"". I just truly think this is a ridiculous film on a number of levels, and it's not something I would ever make nor watch again. A couple that has fallen off the beaten track either has an abusive situation going on, or one of them lacks character. Again, it's pretty simple stuff. No film can really capture the ""magic"" of an affair, because affairs aren't magical to begin with. They're acts of betrayal. Like I said, it's not a film I'll ever see again, nor would I like to work on this kind of project (paycheque depending). Hell, if I were forced to shoot something like this, I'd end it with a bunch of special forces men rappelling down from helicopters during the orgy scene and raiding the place. Just me *insert smile here*.Not everyone can have a really good looking spouse, nor have steamy conjugal relations on a regular basis. So the urge is repressed, and when someone mentions the idea to another person, these stupid, cult like, ""religious"" swingers societies develop. And I imagine people get hurt. I don't really know as I've no experience in that matter.But, Kubrick wants us to look at his version of a couple ""gone swinging""; one that has sexual exploration in mind. To me it's more of a comedy than anything else. I used to love seeing a Kubirck film because of his static yet compelling cinematography. The shots and assemblage of images from a former photo-journalist are supreme in execution. And yet, even so, even though Stanley Kubrick has been elevated to legendary status among industry and cine-files alike, he was, after all, only mortal. As is evident by this film.Skip this one. If you need to see sex on the screen, then hit one of the adult websites of your choice.Watch at your own risk.p.s. you don't betray the one you love. Ever.p.p.s. the other theme here is keeping interest in the one you love. Don't lose interest.*EDIT* Final edit here; the thrust of this film was to get the husband to rekindle interest in his wife. Her concern may have been since he lost interest in other women by actively suppressing his desire, he thus lost interest in her. It became her objective to reinvigorate his desire for her. Kubrick tried to make a noire ""adult film"", but, and maybe it's because I'm not married, I just couldn't connect with it. Still, it was well shot. See it for that alone.",Eyes Wide Shut
75,Movie-ManDan,A Worthy Final Chapter In The Career Of Arguably The Best Director Ever.,8,3 April 2021,"While Stanley Kubrick has not dabbled in every film genre, he has covered most. Nearly all of them are raved as being some of the best and most innovative films ever made. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was in development hell for thirty years and took well over a year to shoot, but was worth the wait. Sure it could have been better, but Mr. Kubrick's talents as a director make this better and more interesting than it could have been.Bill (Tom Cruise) is a well-respected physician in the Big Apple with his loving wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman) and a beautiful daughter. Kidman gives her first great performance as Cruise's seemingly loving wife. They were married in real life at the time, making their chemistry top-notch. Cruise gives one of his best performances in what was really his year. The year was 1999 and Cruise starred in Stanley Kubrick's last film and Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia."" He was excellent in both. I think people forget just how talented he is and don't remember his juicy acting chops.During a supremely fancy party, Bill encounters an old friend from medical school named Nicholas who is now and concert pianist. Nick recommends Bill check out his next gig to which Bill absolutely agrees.The next night, Bill and Alice are making love and getting high. But Alice is spoiling for a fight where she admits to fantasizing about having sex with another man. Bill is devastated because he would never even think about cheating on his wife.That night, Bill gets called to duty but stays out since he can't get the sensual images out of his head. He is about to make it with a hooker but is unable to. He then goes to see Nick perform where he is immediately drawn in to go to Nick's next gig that night: he will be playing piano at a masquerade orgy outside the city. Bill doesn't know what to expect and is shocked to see what it entails.So far the film is great. Great look, great acting, great filming, and mysterious. But everything after Bill's night time odyssey does not measure up to what happened before. There's another hour of one forgettable thing happening after another.One other weak thing is the message seems unclear. This certainly wants to tell us something, but what? It definitely deals with marriage and infidelity, but what exactly? Kubrick loved making ambiguous films, but this is a normal drama. Why baffle viewers? If the second half was not as long and more insight was dealt on trying to say what the movie tries to convey, everything would have been better.If another director made this, it likely would not had been as good. Kubrick makes the film look great and the camera's fluidity in it movement are all admirable. Also, any major director's final film that is truly good is usually always remembered. Kubrick happened to incorporate controversial elements which helps be remembered, but trust me when I say this would have been as remembered if it did not receive so much controversy.Does this reach the heights of ""Spartacus"" or ""The Shining""? No and far from it. That is why people usually describe this as a ""worthy"" final chapter, not a ""perfect"" finale. At least Stanley Kubrick went out in a blaze and not in a blunder.3/4.",Eyes Wide Shut
76,Galina_movie_fan,Perfect Conclusion to the Trilogy of Great Journeys:,10,8 February 2006,"I believe that Kubrick's swansong is a great masterpiece, it is one of my favorite films and has been since I saw it first time. I felt under the film's spell from the very beginning: the camera was so much in love with Kidman's gorgeous figure, her golden hair; the music by Shostakovich - so European even though the film takes place in NYC. The film was so clever and so mesmerizing. The more I watched the more I realized that there was something vaguely familiar and strangely comical in the film. I kept thinking and it occurred to me that Kubrick paid homage and parodied Joyce's ""Ulysses"" in the same way Joyce himself treated Homer's celebrated poem. For me, there are so many similarities between ""Bloomsday"" and ""Billnight"", between both men's journeys and adventures on the streets of Dublin and NYC that I am curious if anyone else noticed that. There are visits to the Kingdom of Dead, sirens, Cyclops, the sorceress that turns men in pigs (the figure of speech that is :)). Both Bloom and Bill try to run from but can't forget and eventually come back to the only woman they are attracted to for eternity - Penelope - Molly Bloom- Alice Harford. Both deeply suffer from her infidelity (Bloom from the real one and Bill from imaginative but it hurts the same). Both are very insecure men who doubt their own masculinity and try to prove to them that they are the real men but they can't. Both are married to the strong women who would give them hope in the end - both ""Ulysses"" and ""EWS"" ends on the affirmative note. The last word in ""Ulysses"" ""Yes"" belongs to Molly just before she fell asleep and the last lines in EWS are: ""Alice Harford: I do love you and you know there is something very important we need to do as soon as possible. Dr. Bill Harford: What's that? Alice Harford: F_uck."" If that's not the happiest and most satisfying ending for a movie ever then I don't know which one is. For the great ending I can forgive a movie many sins. But tell you the truth, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is perfect, it has nothing to apologize for. It is the movie that would be admired many years from now. Perfect conclusion to the trilogy of great journeys of a man for search of himself - ""Odyssey"", ""Ulysses"", and ""Eyes Wide Shut"".",Eyes Wide Shut
77,framptonhollis,Kubrick's Final Masterpiece,10,23 December 2015,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is one of the best Christmas movies of all time! But, it isn't a movie for the whole family to get together and watch next to a warm campfire on a snowy Christmas Eve. In fact, it barley has anything to do with Christmas, it just seem to take place around the holiday. But, it is an excellent film nonetheless.Starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, this is a psychological thriller from master director Stanley Kubrick. It is both Kubrick's final film, and one of his absolute greatest, using elements of drama, horror, mystery, and, even really dark comedy. It is a masterful film on every level, with great acting, plot, and filmmaking.The strange cult sequence is definitely the highlight. It has a horribly nightmarish feel to it, especially because of the eerie score and set up. I made my experience watching that sequence even more disturbing, since I imagined MYSELF in the same scenario, which always adds an extra level of horror while watching a thriller like ""Eyes Wide Shut"".",Eyes Wide Shut
78,raulfaust,Very Kubricky,7,14 March 2012,"Tom Cruise's character is a strange person. Although he may be very intelligent since he is a physician, in many scenes he shows the spectator he is not that sane. Many of his actions in this picture aren't totally normal. For instance, who would accept to enter in a hooker's house and after deciding the price, go away because the wife gave a simple call? It's not common among men. Nicole Kidman's is an even crazier character, and sometimes it's annoying that sex is the only thing she talks about. I don't think the story is very plausible or reliable, but I can admit it is original. The main thing that keeps this movie working is the exceptional DIRECTING. Kubrick, as usual, makes the slow story become very entertaining, and even shocking the spectator when the scene could be totally uninteresting. The scene of the mask laying in the pillow was pretty intense, I got even scared when this scene began-- and see, this isn't an horror movie or anything. All in all, even thought the poor ending, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a good movie due to the professional directing and the original story, but don't have extreme expectations from this...",Eyes Wide Shut
79,JuguAbraham,Essay on Fidelity and Marriage,10,5 November 2000,"I rate this movie as one of two finest films made in the 1990s--alongside Terrence Malik's The Thin Red Line. Both films had the majority of their viewers disliking the films in question and a minority heaping praises on them! I belong to the minority who loved the film.A major problem for most viewers was that most viewers expected a film full of sex and nudity. Sex and nudity serves only as the backdrop of the film.
From the password ""Fidelio"" to the fact that two married individuals chose to play the main roles, there are clues that this fascinating film is all about reaffirmation of faith in marriage and trust, on jealousy and redemption of faith in marriage..small but important facets of the cosmic reality of our lives. The trail of thought is connected to several facets philosophical innuendoes provided in ""2001"".Pook's minimalist score is another highlight of this great film. Mature performances abound.I saw the film when I was sleepy and five minutes into the film, I was wide awake. It is not a film for the average filmgoer; it is one for those who appreciate cinema, music and philosophy. I loved ""2001"", but I appreciated ""Eyes wide shut"" even better.",Eyes Wide Shut
80,philip_vanderveken,Too bad Kubrick had to end his career with a false note . . .,6,21 June 2005,"I've always considered Stanley Kubrick as one of the biggest geniuses ever to have worked in Hollywood. A man who has made movies like ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""The Shining"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and so many more excellent movies, doesn't deserve any less than to be seen as one of the greatest ever. But I really wonder what he had in mind when making this one. This was his last, but in my opinion also his least...The movie tells the story of a doctor who becomes obsessed with having a sexual encounter after his wife has admitted that she has had sexual fantasies about a man she once met. She hates the fact that he doesn't admit that he has had similar fantasies in the past and keeps torturing him with the idea. This leads him into unfulfilled encounters with a dead patient's daughter and a hooker, but when he pays a visit to a nightclub where he meets an old friend, he learns about a special secret society where sexual rituals are performed. Intrigued by the unknown, he decides to attend one of their congregations, but almost immediately finds himself in a lot of trouble. Not only is his own life in danger, so are his marriage and the lives of his wife and daughter...Before you think that I didn't like this movie because of all the nudity or the sexual content, I want you to know that such things don't bother me at all, certainly not when they add to the story and are brought in a very nice way (like in this movie for instance). No, what really bothered me about this movie was it's incredibly slow pace. I'm used to watch alternative and 'foreign' (read European, South American and Asian movies), but this certainly was one of the slowest that I've ever seen. Some will say that it helps to see the 'dream-like' state the characters are in... Possible, but it certainly didn't work for me. I got bored after a while and almost thought about hitting the fast forward button (something that I've never had before with other movies). I'm not saying that I wanted to see several action scenes in this movie either. Those who know me or those who have read several of my reviews on this website will know that I'm far from a fan of action-filled movies. I hate big explosions, a couple million rounds fired at an innocent bystander,... I really don't like that and don't need it to enjoy a movie. What I want is a very powerful story, some excellent acting and some nice camera-work. That, I did get from this movie at regular moments.Kubrick certainly knew how to create a certain atmosphere, thanks to the clever use of music and original camera work. And the fact that he chose Kidman and Cruise as his two main actors wasn't a bad choice either. But it is never enough to save the entire movie and the main reason why it got a lot of its publicity is probably because the director died before the project was closed and because Kidman and Cruise decided to end their marriage shortly after the movie was released... As I already said, Kubrick was one of Hollywood's greatest, but this was one of his weaker movies. I give it a 6/10.",Eyes Wide Shut
81,screenman,Disappointing,6,6 August 2011,"I'm a Tom Cruise fan, but certainly not a Nicole Kidman fan; so I came to this movie with very mixed expectations. Stanley Kubrick is a director who enjoyed such acclaim since his 2001-Space Odyssey as to assume a position that is almost beyond criticism. In short, if one finds fault in his work; oneself is assumed to be at fault.This movie certainly answers to his skill in terms of technical prowess. Yet the overall effect for me is disappointment. Cruise has invariably enjoyed a reputation as an action man - here he's anything but. Kidman's common femme-fatale persona is supplanted by a confusing amalgam of seductress and thinking-man's crumpet. For me, that doesn't quite wash either.It seems as if Cruise is constantly on the edge of something more visceral, but he is never allowed to break out; whilst Kidman appears permanently frustrated by lack of opportunity to flaunt her ample charms. One can't help feeling that the dislocation of their personal relationship is being acted out on the screen.This is a very dialogue-driven work, yet the script is never intelligent, witty or ironic enough to hold one's attention alone. So it drags from time to time. There are moments of incoherency. At one point, Cruise's character gate-crashes an intriguing little masked ball. There are hints of a demonic rite. But nothing comes of it. His cover is blown and he is warned to keep quiet or else. A piano-playing friend who tipped him off about the party disappears without trace under very suspicious circumstances. Meanwhile, a girl at the party who warns him he is under suspicion and that her life is at risk by just telling him, winds up dead also under suspicious circumstances. It looks like the plot is finally taking-off, yet nothing derives from these events. Why all the secrecy? It was only a glorified gang-bang after all. Another friend (who was there) warns him against any further inquiry in a crassly amateurish way, reasoning that his friend has probably just skipped town, and that the girl was just a drug-addicted prostitute anyway (she died from an overdose), so there was really nothing suspicious. But if they were in the habit of inviting itinerant druggie whores to their little get-togethers, how could they even hope for absolute secrecy? The story just didn't stack up.I personally like ambiguous denouements just as much as neat summations. But this movie just seems to limp along presenting one idea after another to little plausible effect, ultimately drawing to conclusion for no other apparent reason than that the celluloid seemed to run out.It is less than the sum of its parts, and they each seem to small enough purpose, Cruise, Kidman and Kubrick notwithstanding. A lavish presentation with nothing to say that is really worth hearing.",Eyes Wide Shut
82,brando647,"Sorry, I Just Don't Get It",6,14 February 2011,"I'm a major fan of Stanley Kubrick's films, though I'm not always the greatest at dissecting them for the deepest content. Still, I can usually walk away with a good understanding of what Kubrick was trying to convey, but not here. For whatever reason, I couldn't see anything but the surface value of Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT. The film is about Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman). Alice reveals to Bill that she once thought of having an affair and how she would've given up her entire life, her husband, her daughter, etc. for even one night with a passing Naval officer she'd seen. This news completely destroys Bill and he sets out into the streets of New York with visions of his wife in the arms of another man haunting his mind. Over the course of the night, he stumbles into a mysterious gathering in a secluded home where the halls are filled with people engaged in a ritualistic orgy. When Bill is discovered as an intruder and he believes a woman has been killed in order to protect him, he begins an his own investigation into what happened that night.Kubrick always seemed to have a much deeper meaning behind the surface story and I'm sure this film is no different. Many critics and fans have praised this film endlessly, so I'm sure there is more to it than meets the eye. I'm sorry to say I just don't get it. It seems to hint at a glimpse into jealousy and the power of sex (or lack thereof) in relationships. For me, all of this potential subtext is lost when I'm drawn into the mystery behind the strange cult/society Bill wanders into. For the remainder of the movie, I just wanted to see this plot-line pan out and fill in the answers and any subtext was overlooked. If you're a true Kubrick fan and haven't watched this film yet, I hope you won't let my own inability to understand it influence your decision in any way. This film has been hailed by some as a masterpiece and is still an intriguing, suspenseful drama.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman do a fantastic job here, especially Kidman who's every line seems to drip with venom following their initial stoned confrontation over her once-desired infidelity. At the time of the film, the two were still married and I'm sure it contributed to their chemistry on-screen (well, maybe the awkwardness between the two sexually in the beginning or the animosity to come later). Again, Kubrick utilizes his masterful skills at creating atmosphere with his grainy footage, minimalist piano score, and colorful lighting. Despite the slow crawling pace of the film, it manages to remain engaging despite it's nearly three hour runtime. The ending was less than stellar and I felt it left a lot of loose ends, but again that's because my focus was on the mystery as opposed to the Harford's relationship. When the movie was over, it left me wanting answers but I still had the usual unease that seems to follow all of Kubrick's films. This film is probably best for true Kubrick fans and will leave the more casual fans a little underwhelmed.",Eyes Wide Shut
83,bandw,Perhaps Kubrick's most emotionally accessible film,9,27 April 2012,"As fascinating as they are Kubrick's other films from this are about people and events you are not likely to experience in real life. In this movie Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) may be living a New York City lifestyle beyond the financial reach of most of us, but it is easy to identify with their emotional lives. They have been married for nine years and the opening scene establishes how comfortable they are with each other, maybe too comfortable. For example, in preparing for an upscale party given by a wealthy friend, Bill is looking in the mirror while Alice is on the toilet. She is dressed in an elegant black gown and when she gets up Bill does not even look at her as he tells her she looks great.At the party both Bill and Alice are the subjects of attempted seductions. The scene between Bill and Alice in their Manhattan apartment after the party is pivotal, and one of the best in the movie. It shows just what a delicate balance relationships can be in. Alice was a little suspicious of Bill's disappearing after she had seen him with two young women at the party and in her interrogation of her husband she subtly twists everything he says to put him on the spot. For her part she confesses to a past obsession with a Naval officer that she had seen only once from a distance. Her confession punctures Bill's confidence in their relationship as he imagines Alice together with the officer. But, beyond the jealousy, Bill's imaginings spark a sexual passion in him. This scene sets up the entire rest of the movie, not only the story line, but the filming. Kubrick's use of color in this movie is striking, lushly lighted foregrounds with contrasting backgrounds. The scene that has Alice softly lighted standing in a doorway with the room behind her a deep blue is typical.In ultimate frustration Bill leaves the apartment to wander the streets of New York. He meets an old friend in a bar and the intrigue begins. Bill winds up at an exclusive ritualistic sexual orgy where everyone wears a medieval mask. Anyone who has seen this movie will remember the orgy scenes--they are mesmerizing, but not pornographic. One thing that is pressed home is how much of sex is driven by what is imagined, both good and bad.As things progress the movie takes on the aspects of part thriller and part comedy. In the end the audience is left asking what is real and what is fake. But at least the relationship between Bill and Alice is resolved.I can't remember when a musical score has played such an important part in a movie. The romantic Shostakovitch Russian Waltz is a perfect background for the lighter scenes, but it is the second movement of Ligeti's Musica Ricercata that adds a particularly haunting quality to the scenes where Bill is wandering in the darkness. I had not realized how the playing of a single note on a piano can build tension.There are scenes that seemed superfluous to me, like the scene where Bill runs into a bunch of rowdies who hector him on the street, accusing him of being gay. This film adds to the distinguished list of accomplishments of a great director.",Eyes Wide Shut

86,DeeNine-2,Marriage is always under siege,9,12 March 2000,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Eyes Wide Shut is not the self-indulgent, opaque film that I had been led by some reviews to expect. It is clear and focused with an important and worthy theme. Kubrick is exploring the nature of human sexuality in light of recent conclusions derived from evolutionary biology. The theme can be stated simply: 'marriage is a fortress continually under siege.' To be able to use Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as his married couple, who not so incidentally are actually married to one another, was quite a coup since it lent accessibility and immediacy to his theme. We are able to catch glimpses of what their married life might be like and to see that marriage played out against the temptations of a cosmopolitan lifestyle.Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford, an attractive, high status, confident male who has always deceived himself about his sexual nature, and the nature of women and especially the nature of his wife, Alice. They go to a party and act out some 'teasing themselves' roles, as they have undoubtedly done before. Nothing comes of it since they are circumspect people. But the next night stoned on marijuana Alice decides to strip away her husband's smug confidence about her nature and expose to him the truth about feminine sexuality, and so tells him a little story about how she was moved to abandonment by just a glance from a man in uniform. Her expression is so vivid and powerful that Bill, stunned and shocked, begins to imagine this event that never took place, an event Alice has assured him, might well have taken place. As he visualizes, he begins to explore himself as various expressions of human sexuality are thrown his way, the prostitute, the gay-bashing young men, the teenage girl entertaining older men...etc. What he sees behind his mask watching the enactment of a secret medieval pagan ceremony tempts and enlightens him. This film did not work well for a general audience for several reasons. One, many people did NOT identify with the privileged and glamorous couple. Two, the resolution of the theme was without the usual violence and/or sexual indulgence common in contemporary American cinema, a disappointment for some. Three, many young couples viewing the film together or at least in light of their own marriages, were made uncomfortable and threatened by being reminded of their own temptations and frustrations. To have the truth of our duplicitous natures rubbed in our faces, as it were, is not something everybody wants to sit still for. Most people lie to themselves about sex and their sexual behavior and especially their hidden sexual desires most of the time. Kubrick wanted us to see how compromised we really are. Finally, some were disappointed by an ending in which we see that we are human, all too human, and we have to accept that and live with it. Bill, realizing what he has done, not so much in action, as in his heart, cries out to Alice, what shall we do now? And she wisely says (because she has already figured this out) 'Be Grateful,' one day does not make an entire lifetime.What is wonderful about a film like this is that, instead of going to the movies, fat and comfortable with the steak and wine in our bellies, expecting to be diverted from the irritations of our lives and to be massaged by the story upon the screen (as in say, You've Got Mail (1998) or Titanic (1998)) instead we are confronted with some uncomfortable truths about our own lives, and made to squirm. Our eyes are indeed wide shut, and we kid ourselves and tell ourselves lies about who we are sexually and what we really feel and want. Marriage is a compromise with the world and with our nature. Something is gained and something is lost, but this is no perfect world; and just as it is better to be respectable and a member of the establishment than to sleep in the streets, it is better to marry and maintain that marriage against our animal nature than it is to toss it away.Kidman is mesmerizing and reinforces her reputation as great talent. As always she becomes the character she is playing. Cruise is clever, cute and has great timing. The sets are crisp and absolutely right for the story, and the dialogue is first class. The sometimes annoying score is appropriate. But this is not a great movie. Some of the scenes could have been sped up, and Kubrick did play the suspense card a little too slowly at times. I would rank it with the best of Kubrick's work, somewhere between Dr. Strangelove (1964) and The Shining (1980), superior to Spartacus (1960) but not quite on the level of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Certainly we see the mark of the mature artist here in both theme and treatment.For those interested in an academic discussion of the theme (and possibly where Kubrick got some of his ideas) I recommend the following books on human sexuality from the point of view of evolutionary psychology:Baker, Robin. Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex (1996)Diamond, Jared. Why is Sex Fun? The Evolution of Human Sexuality (1997)Margulis, Lynn and Dorion Sagan. Mystery Dance: On the Evolution of Human Sexuality (1991). Ridley, Matt. The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature (1993)Russell, Robert Jay. The Lemur's Legacy: The Evolution of Power, Sex, and Love.(1993)I especially liked the latter two. No longer does a man have to ask, 'What does a woman want?' It's pretty clear and understandable. (She wants to have her cake and eat it too.) And of course we always knew what a man wanted.",Eyes Wide Shut
87,DJAkin,My Eyes never shut the entire movie!,7,12 February 2002,"I have seen this movie three times.  Once was at the theater.  The next two times were on television.  I believe that this was in true Kubrick fasion. It's rumored that Tom Cruise was so into his character that he insisted that people called him by his character's name.  He even LIVED on the set.  The movie follows the character by Tom Cruise and his obsession with sex and the underworld that it's taking place in.  There is a lot to this movie.  The only irritating thing about this movie was the dang piano.  The soundtrack was a little strange but hence, Stanley.  That's how Stan prefers to direct. He likes to tease his viewers with strange sounds that lure the viewer into the world that he creates.  In EWS, the goods are delivered mostly by Tom Cruise.  Nichole Kidman's character was forgettable as her character in To Die For.  If it's strangeness that you desire, I would suggest seeing this movie.  It's especially good for Tom Cruise fans.

88,sme_no_densetsu,A complex swan song from Kubrick,8,4 September 2017,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" marked the end of legendary director Stanley Kubrick's career, being completed mere days before his death. His first film in more than a decade, it was eagerly anticipated but was ultimately met with mixed reviews. This was probably partially due to the advertising campaign that tried to sell the movie as an erotic thriller. What moviegoers actually got was something much more unique and surreal.The story focuses on a married couple, Dr. William & Alice Harford (played by Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman). When Alice confesses that she fantasized about cheating on her husband with a young naval officer it disturbs him that his marriage may not be as secure as he thought. Over the course of the night he embarks on an odyssey of sexual discovery wherein he grapples with his newfound jealousy & insecurity.This synopsis is purposely fairly vague since I feel that the plot moves into such unexpected territory that it would be a shame to go into the movie knowing too much. The trailer gives away very little but it probably led people to expect a completely different kind of movie. While there is a heavy sexual element to the movie, I certainly wouldn't call it erotic. To me it seems much more clinical (perhaps mirroring the doctor's viewpoint), studied & surreal.The movie shows Kubrick's attention to detail in every frame. There's a consistent dream-like vibe that's unlikely to appeal to everyone. I find this to be clearly evident in the visuals and the music but also in the acting. Despite moving at a very deliberate pace, the story is gripping, at least once the initial groundwork is laid. However, the script's main strength is the amount of depth that it has, leading to many possible interpretations. To be honest, I was somewhat bewildered the first time I saw the movie but the second time around I discovered a whole new layer of meaning.The acting is a bit harder to judge. The film's dream-like feel called for a more mannered approach than is typical of today's films. To some, this might be seen as artificial. Personally, I think that some of the acting comes across as a bit laboured but, overall, I'm happy with all of the performances. Tom Cruise, in particular, showed that he was up to the task of playing a character whose seemingly perfect exterior masked an interior plagued with doubts.""Eyes Wide Shut"" is truly the type of movie that practically begs for multiple viewings. From a visual standpoint, it's absolutely gorgeous. When it comes to the story, it's both compelling and thought-provoking. In retrospect, it seems unbelievable that the movie got almost no recognition at the major awards shows (Oscars, Golden Globes & BAFTAs). While it may not quite reach the dizzying heights of all-time classics like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" & ""A Clockwork Orange"", it isn't that far off.",Eyes Wide Shut
89,michaeltrivedi,Cinematic Perfection,9,2 October 2019,"Eyes Wide Shut did not get great reviews. It was also shunned by audiences and reviewers alike for it's depiction of sex, and even became known as an erotic pornographic film. It was the last of Kubrick's film, and he died shortly afterwards, before it was released. I think Kubrick made the greatest film of all time.First, let's get into the story. Bill Hartford is a doctor in New York. He and his wife transverse through the upper-class society, and is introduced to this life through Bill's employer. On one given night, Bill's wife mentions to him that she had fantasies a few years ago about leaving him for another man. Distraught, Bill heads over to a clients' home to check in on an old, sick man. And thus begins an unforgettable night that edges on crossing the boundaries of sex, but doesn't quite ever get there. It's a dreamlike night where Bill is constantly offered sexual interactions, but doesn't engage in them.This movie portrays only one night. However, from Bill's attitudes and mannuerisms, it's pretty apparent that Bill has engaged in sex beyond his marriage. And yet, this one night seems to hold something special for the man. I am sure he's cheated on his wife before, and he'll probably do it again.The movie is very slow, and at times creepy. And yet the plot is during Christmastime, and there is a jolly festive feeling you are getting. The walking along the New York streets in a trenchcoat is one of my favorite things about this movie. There is also a scene in a private mansion where a sex orgy is taking place among masked men who are basically the ruling class.It's a very dark and creepy movie, and yet has all the feels of a family movie. There is really nothing learned in all of this, except that Bill should not cheat on his wife. The moral is that family is the most important thing in life.I thought it was a fantastic film. I would highly recommend it.10 Stars",Eyes Wide Shut
90,dunmore_ego,Pants Wide Open.,4,13 August 2011,"Stanley Kubrick directs EYES WIDE SHUT with his pants wide open.Elegant somberness, lurid themes, disturbing visuals, foreboding music, screaming colors. And tits.Tits tits tits. Not banana teats, cow udders or raisins either, but perfectly-rounded, gently-sloped baseballs to cantaloupes. On women ivory-legged, flat-bellied, pear-buttocked, butter-smooth, hungry-lipped, not one a notch below 9. Call it art. Call it exploration of the dark side of the soul blah blah. Fact is, a magnificent portion of EYES WIDE SHUT is naked women. Simple. Kubrick ""clothes"" this prurience in the mantle of filmmaking, but isn't that how all artists score bitches (from rock stars to architects)? By couching their base intentions in seeming nobility? Yet, ironically, there can be nothing nobler than desiring to procreate, yet that too is cloaked in the bait-and-switch of family-raising.But back to the naked women... Who are they and what do they want with my willy? They are the licentious consorts at the exclusive sex mansion that Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) infiltrates and then finds he can't escape.You see, Harford and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) started speculating one night about their sexual fantasies and Harford discovers, to his chagrin, that hers are more exciting, detailed and likely to happen than his, which sets him on a libidinous quest to live lewd. No matter that the couple is happily married, have a daughter and successful jobs, let the blue-balled odyssey begin...After unfulfilling encounters on the tame side of filth, a chance meeting with a friend gets Harford the secret password to the ultra-exclusive sex club for the super-desensitized. Luckily, everyone at the ritual has to dress in masks and cloaks like they're reenacting a Mozart opera, so no one knows Harford is crashing their orgy. Until the cult leader calls him out by name and asks him the password to - exit...Cruise and Kidman reunite as an on screen couple - again (DAYS OF THUNDER 1990, FAR AND AWAY 1992), this time reportedly straining their real-life marriage with the hurtful residue of their brilliant performances. Further than balls deep. Beard or not. Or maybe it was that scene with the hooligans who pass Cruise on the street and call him a faggot. (I bet those guys are STILL eating out on that.) One time too many to simply flash the frozen smile and laugh it off? The movie's opening scene is a harbinger of the territory it intends to tread: Harford, chatting to his wife Alice, walks into the bathroom where she sits on the toilet in a long, high-slit ball gown; she wipes herself with toilet paper and throws it away, chatting back nonchalantly. So innocuous, so sexy, so dirty (and all I could think of as she slinked through that party was the moist spot on her panties). Close eyes, ride it back down to calm...Movie is telling us it will unflinchingly take us through the most private moments of this couple, uncomfortably close.Written for the screen by Kubrick and Frederic Raphael, from Arthur Schnitzler's novel Traumnovelle, EYES WIDE SHUT seems to allude to that old gag, ""You think you know someone..."" In other words, when entering into marriage, you should supposedly know everything about the other person; the plan is - with eyes wide open. But is that ever possible in a species that cannot read each others' thoughts? Kubrick's characteristic disturbing directorial style leaves us as disoriented as the lead character. As Harford's morals are warring within him, colors seem to fight with each other in his scenes - oranges and deep blues, ambers and ceruleans; as Harford stalks the New York sidewalk lathering himself into lust, the camera leads, then follows, moving eerily, as adrift as he is; as the couple speak in unloving tones in their marriage bedroom, the harsh lighting frays our corneas; when Harford tries to hire a cloak and mask costume, the lewd tableau he walks into (with Leelee Sobieski, Rade Sherbedgia and some Asian men) is disturbing for what it DOESN'T reveal.The password: Fidelio. The expressionless gold mask. The taxi ride to the orgy mansion: nowhere. The single repeated piano note: pling......... pling....... pling..... The ritual: the tribades, letting cloaks fall to reveal their naked perfection (""But I say unto you, That whosoever look on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."" --King James Bible. Sorry, Christians - you're all going to hell!). The warning: leave. The sex: watching, performing, feigning disinterest, but it's the focal point of existence. The cameo: Sydney Pollack? The murder: identifying the sappho who warned him. The bonus: Nicole Kidman wearing nothing but reading glasses.Okay... ride it down again.... calm... calm...In the United States, EYES WIDE SHUT is rated NC-17 (that's the poop-your-pants, highest, deadliest rating a movie can get, without being porn), not because of its disturbing themes but because it shows people engaging in the life-creating practice of sex. Censors would much rather you drank in the death-creating practice of murder. Heaven forbid we show our kids how to make love; let's show them how to kill, and then we'll blame Judas Priest for the school shootings. A movie filled brim to end with murder can only manage an R-rating in the United States. What does that say about the hypocritical, gutless, inconsistent, wrong-headed, wrong-prioritied American censors? That they're nothing but a bunch of TITS.",Eyes Wide Shut

92,frankde-jong,A rather disappointing last film of Kubrick.,6,29 July 2020,"""Eyes wide shut"" is a film about a nocturnal sexual odyssey, inititiated by the confession of mental adultry by the wife of the main character.It illustrates the opinion of many men of having exclusive rights on or being the only gender susceptible to erotic temptations. They are shocked when a woman (their woman!) apparently is not immune either.We see this in ""Vredens dag"" (1943, Carl Theodor Dreyer) when an older man really beliefs he can give a young girl all that she wants. We see it also in ""Eyes wide shut"" when the man of a young couple really thinks that his wife has to worry about the beautiful girls flirting with him at a party but not vice versa because women are naturally inclined to fidelity.At the end of the sexual odyssey the man is converted to a monogamous relationship. This ending gives the film a little moralistic aftertaste. All in all a rather disappointing last film of Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut
93,bobsgrock,The final chapter of the book of Kubrick.,7,4 February 2009,"There is no real reason to argue that Stanley Kubrick was one of the finest directors to ever stand behind a camera. From Dr. Strangelove to 2001: A Space Odyssey to Full Metal Jacket, Kubrick was able to polarize and hypnotize the audience with his brilliant composition, camera movement, and incredible storytelling. Here, he explores the human desires to copulate and have intimacy with one another. What is interesting is that this is an issue we all know about and that the movie industry really seems to like, especially these days as practically every film made has a sex scene ore sexual reference in it. For Kubrick, he makes it more of a dream as the plot stretches off into wild and weird sections we weren't expecting and really kind of put us off in a way.As Tom Cruise's character begins to explore the sexual events that surround him throughout the night, the film feels more and more deliberately slow in pace as well as more strange in tone. I believe Kubrick is doing this intentionally in order to plunge us further in the mindset that Dr. Harford is unaware and confused of the events happening to him. That being said, it feels a bit too long and there are some scenes that don't fit with the rest. The first hour is really strong as we view the marriage bonds between the doctor and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) strain as they both face temptation. As we follow Bill into this fantasy of sexual desires and obsession, the plot gets weirder and the questions pile up. This is not to say Kubrick doesn't wrap things up but not everything is revealed.For me, this was not one of Kubrick's many masterpieces. I did admire the film for its insight on the reason of marriage and the ties it requires between two people. It also is very good in its atmosphere and set-up, which Kubrick always did well. However, I couldn't really get into it but that may be the reason behind the motives. For any Kubrick fan, this is worth checking out, but despite it not being up to his other stuff, there are definite traces of a great film here. It is only too unfortunate that he died so soon. One can only imagine what he would have done next.",Eyes Wide Shut
94,Philby-3,Vale Stanley,7,8 August 1999,"Was Kubrick a maker of popular Hollywood films who masqueraded as an art film auteur, or a giant of the cinema who liked to break even on a picture? This one certainly indicates he liked to do things his way, but it is an entertaining film nevertheless, despite the length (160 minutes) and the stately pace.I think Kubrick's widow Christine got it right when she said ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is about fear. In this case it is the fear that one is missing out on something forbidden but delicious, or perhaps the fear that one has failed to achieve true fulfillment despite all the conventional trappings of success. Dr Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) has it all - society practice, luxurious Manhattan apartment, Range Rover, beautiful attentive art curator wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) and cute small daughter. Bill is motivated to find what he's missed by Alice's confession that she had been prepared to give him and everything else up for a handsome naval officer she merely saw across a crowded room at a resort months ago. Fueled by mental images of Alice cavorting with the officer, Bill goes out to find whatever it was he's missed. The journey is an interesting one with Kubrick doing his usual stringing together of set pieces/cameos to reach a rather maudlin but vaguely cheerful conclusion. The unjustly notorious orgy scene is absurd rather than erotic but some of the scenes between Bill and Alice are as intimate as one gets in cinema.Kubrick was like Hitchcock in using detail to telling effect, though unlike Kubrick, Hitchcock knew when to stop. Tom Cruise breaks down and cries at one stage, probably because Stanley had asked him to do the scene for the 101st time. The detail is truly extraordinary. Just one example. In the opening scene, Alice is naked in front of a mirror above her dressing table and Bill, also naked, moves to caress her. On the dressing table are a few books. On the top is Alan Bullock's biography of Hitler and Stalin. A conventional enough tome to find as a young NYC doctor's bedside reading. The next book down is a biography of (the still living) Lord Longford. Lord Longford? He was the eccentric peer who launched a futile campaign against pornography in Britain in the early 1960s including among his targets Kubrick's film of Lolita. This reference is in the only mildly erotic scene in the whole film. A Lolita-like character makes a brief appearance later on and the angle offered will not amuse the politically correct, or Lord Longford, if he is still watching.Detail is used for dramatic effect, not realism. Thus Bill gets on the Interstate to get to the country estate where the orgy is being held and winds up in England. Stanley plays fast and loose with the locations. The exterior is Mentmore in Buckinghamshire, built by the Rothschilds, some of the interior is Highclere in Hampshire, another fantastic Victorian pile, and the orgy scene is set in a Moorish style room in Elveden, the Guinness family mansion in Suffolk. The plot doesn't bear close examination but the script is workmanlike and the minor performances enjoyable. You can see why actors liked to work with Kubrick despite his reputation for inordinate pains - he always gave the bit players a scene to steal (with Peter Sellars in ""Dr Strangelove"" being a multiple offender).As for the leads, Tom Cruise (""it's OK, I'm a doctor""), although playing the character we see the film through, doesn't quite project a personality the audience can relate to - somehow it's hard to empathise with him and his obsession. Nicole Kidman is fine - yes of course she can act. She is particularly good early on, at a posh party, fending off while sloshed an oily would-be lover. Sydney Pollack as Victor, their wealthy and sleazy friend, is a standout also.Well, that's Kubrick. His older films stand up amazingly well (eg ""Paths of Glory"", ""Dr Strangelove""). He was one of the few eccentric individualists of the cinema who actually did their best work on their own. With this film, he went out on a strong note, and I'm sure I'll enjoy a second viewing almost as much as the first.",Eyes Wide Shut
95,baumer,"A great beginning, a hollow end",8,19 July 1999,"Sex can sometimes make us do really strange things.  You see it all the time.  You are at a nightclub, there, surrounding you are 100's of scantily clad beautiful women.  And you may be 25 years old and you have had sex 100's of times in your life time but the sight of those women make you act like you have never seen a breast before.  Never experienced the raw energy of lust, even though you may be dating a beautiful woman.  And then sometimes the question arises.  Should I?  Could I?  Is it all worth it? Tough questions.  Love is usually described as the one thing in this life that can make a strong man weak and a rich man poor.  But if that is true about love, then what can be said about sex?  Because there are times when sex can be more powerful than love.Eyes Wide Shut has a great time exploring that very notion.  It examines what the physical pleasures of the naked body can have on people, not just married people, but people in general.  It looks at what happens when one is tempted.  And it also shows what it is that some people think but rarely ever express.  And when it is expressed in here, a man's jealousy almost destroys not only his marriage, but his life.  And on that psychological level, EWS is a brilliant film.  The first third of the film was mesmerizing.  The dialogue and scenes were so perfect that you could feel yourself remembering situations that were simialr to the ones in the film.
Nicole Kidman plays Alice.  Cruise plays Bill.  They are a married couple and they seem fairly comfortable in their marriage.  But then one night after a huge party where they were both propositioned for sex by other people, they get a little high and Alice begins quizzing Bill about just how far he wanted to go with the two women that were hitting on him at the party.  It is here that the film hits its best notes.  The dialogue is perfect.  You can see how Alice is playing with Bill's words, twisting them and throwing them back in his face.  And then just when it seems that Bill has said the right words to alleviate the tension, Alice reveals that there was a time a year back when she felt that she wanted to have an affair, just a one nighter, but an affair none the less, with some naval officer that was staying in the same hotel as they were.  She graphically tells her husband how she was thinking of the other man while they were making love that afternoon.  And I felt for Bill.  Just as any man would feel for another man in that same spot.  Then in the next 24 hours Bill goes on this labryinthian odyssey.  He refuses sex a few times from willing women and then he gets into some secret orgy and probably almost loses his life.  Now the movie starts getting clouded and grainy.  It is still enjoyable to a certain degree but it is getting kind of weird.  By the time the third act gets going and Cruise and Sydney Pollack do their thing, it is still interesting. But that is where the movie stops being a great film.  Because when Bill and Alice have their talk at the end, I wanted more.  I wanted to feel more . I wanted Bill to not only tell Alice everything but to show her and tell her how much she hurt him.  But he doesn't.  The only emotion he shows is sadness, but not at what his wife has done to him but because of what he has witnessed.  It is so unfortunate that the film wasn't concluded with more energy because EWS has many things to say but just no way of ending them. It just sort of leaves the viewer hanging.I loved the way this film looked.  It made me feel like I was watching The Shining or A Clockwork Orange.  It had that 70's feel to it.  And as I have said, it was a good film, with so much energy and lots of insight to sex and infidelity and love and lust, but it just left me hollow at the end.  And that is a shame, because it was so bright, so ambitious, so witty and so sexy.  But the end just feels not so bright, not so ambitious, a little dull but still sexy.  It is worth seeing.",Eyes Wide Shut
96,DunnDeeDaGreat,Kubrick's at his best,9,10 December 2001,Eyes Wide Shut is pure Kubrick. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and having to explain the ending and plot to the people I saw with it. In a way you have to know Kubrick films to like this movie. I like it and rate it as a ten.,Eyes Wide Shut
97,gizmomogwai,Kubrick's last hurrah,8,28 July 2010,"Just as he did in A Clockwork Orange (1971), Kubrick enjoys putting a lot of female nudity in this movie and still keeps it above the level of porn. There's some unnecessary nudity in Eyes Wide Shut- a female patient passed out naked, a topless woman being examined by her doctor. Yet the film is beautifully shot, almost as hypnotic and surreal as Kubrick's The Shining, and the story is a tasteful, believable look at exotic sexual indiscretions.The movie is basically about a doctor (Tom Cruise) who, behind his wife's back, seeks out a prostitute and later sneaks into an orgy. However, the mysterious masked participants know he doesn't belong there and the doctor may be in danger.The main problem with this movie is the casting of Tom Cruise. I just did not buy him as a doctor, particularly with his dumb ""look at me, I'm so cute"" smile. Nicole Kidman is his wife, both in real life and in the movie. She does better than Cruise and she's nice to look at (As a kid, I had a crush on her after Batman Forever), but she actually isn't in the movie that much. The movie explains some things to us, or so it seems (who the lady who came to the doctor's aid was, and why she died), but keeps other things mysterious, particularly the meaning of the orgy and the identity of its participants. It's not the most intriguing thing I've seen but it's not without worth. A fine movie to end a distinguished career with.",Eyes Wide Shut
98,mattymatt4ever,A memorable final chapter for one of our greatest directors!!!,9,7 May 2001,"Though ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was not easily received by the general public, I consider it an underrated classic.  After all, this is the not the type of film that would appeal to mainstream audiences, which is why I don't see why they fought hard to get the R rating.  This movie proved more popular among the arthouse crowd, who realize the haunting visions that Kubrick portrayed in this masterful effort.  What makes this movie so great is its unpredictability.  That's what distinguishes it from lots of the mainstream garbage that's been shoved down our throats.  Kubrick allows the audience to embark on these characters' weirdly fascinating journeys through this murky atmosphere in New York City. This is not a sex film, like people so rudely judged it as.  Yes, it is quite rife with nudity, but it's all tastefully done, like something out of a Da Vinci painting.  Yes, it has some erotically charged moments, but never for tawdry purposes.  Kubrick helps create this atmosphere via creative lighting, and the score is absolutely brilliant ranging from symphonies that help capture the darkly comic moments to the striking piano chords that accentuate the eerie moments.  Kubrick is a master at creating hypnotic visions that suck viewers in and keep them watching with anticipation.  Viewing this movie for a second time, I was able to spot some flaws, but they're all superficial and very minor.  First of all, Kubrick shot the movie in England.  The story is set in New York.  He does his best to make it look a lot like New York and sometimes succeeds, but at other times fails.  In some scenes, Cruise is walking around at night, and you can see that the streets are clean and polished, and same with the sidewalks.  Anybody who's been to New York at night, or lived there, can spot the inaccuracy.  Those streets would've been filthy, crawling with rats and you would probably see more gangs and drug dealers in the background, whereas Cruise is often walking all-alone--unless a new supporting character is introduced.  Also, some of the very minor characters (Ex.: The Waitress) are obviously hiding their English accents and doing a poor job.  I also felt some of the dialogue scenes could've been cut a tad shorter, and would've been more effective with visual aid.  For example, in the scene where Nicole Kidman describes the bad dream she just had, it would've been nice if we actually saw a dream sequence with her voice-over.Then again, the dialogue is one of the film's strong points.  About the only films that I feel strongly capture the way REAL people talk are this one and ""sex, lies and videotape.""  In the scene where Cruise and Kidman are getting high, and Kidman reveals her dirty secret, they don't articulate what they're saying and seem to ramble on at points.  Because that's what people do when they're high!  And just like Soderbergh's masterpiece, the dialogue isn't literal, and you can tell what one of the characters is really trying to express through facial expressions, body language, etc.  This is another one of those movies that shows people don't always say what they're really thinking, and it's evident when that occurs.  Through this surreal journey, we're faced with many offbeat characters. This sets the film's different tones of black comedy (the incident in the costume shop), drama (the mysterious hooker) and Hitchcockian suspense (the orgy scene).  Best of all, Kubrick leaves an area of mystery in each scene, allowing different interpretations from different minds.  You don't always FIND OUT why the conflicts arise in this movie!  And that's the beauty.  It leaves you thinking and gives your imagination something to do.  The whole movie has this haunting, mystical aura that just draws you in from beginning to end.  Yes, it's 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but I hardly realized the running time being that I was so wrapped up.  Never once does it fall flat, never once is it boring, never once does the intrigue fade out. 
Although, I fell in love with this movie the first time around, I think others might need to watch it a second time and looks beyond the surface. As I said before, this is not a sex film!  This is a movie about lust, deception, temptation, jealousy and every other emotion that would arise from Cruise's character in this situation.  He has just learned about his wife's past sexual affair, and some think that it was a little far-fetched how Cruise reacted in that situation, but I think relationships can be flaming with jealousy--whether they're overreacting or not, it just happens. People lose control of their emotions, and just like Cruise they get plagued by monstrous visions.  In his case, he kept seeing her in bed with the guy from the Navy.  Why he chooses to embark on this unpredictable sexual journey is not exactly expressed on screen.  Once again leaving the audience free to think what his motives might be.  It can be jealousy, it can be something else.  You never know.  Not every situation is entirely realistic, but they weren't meant to be.  This was meant to play like a dream/nightmare that Cruise goes through, roaming the streets of NY at night and bumping into suspicious characters left and right, sometimes putting himself in danger.  Meanwhile, visions of his wife with another man continue to haunt him.I'm almost sure that Kubrick fans will appraise this virtual masterpiece. His perfectionism really shows in every scene of this movie.  And it pays off great.  Steven Spielberg said, ""What's great about Kubrick's films is they're never the same.  All his movies have something different to offer."" So is the case with ""Eyes Wide Shut.""  It's like nothing you've ever seen, even through Kubrick's eyes.  His legacy will always be remembered, and so will this as a successful final chapter in a great filmmaker's life.My score:  9 (out of 10)",Eyes Wide Shut
99,hall895,"A long, strange trip",6,12 May 2011,"Stanley Kubrick's last film, a mere twelve years after his previous one. Bringing Eyes Wide Shut to the screen was a long, strange trip for Kubrick. The idea had been floating around inside his head for many, many years. So much preparation went into it. When shooting finally began it seemed as if it would never end, the noted perfectionist director presiding over one of the longest film shoots ever. And after all of this what was the one thing Kubrick needed most of all? More time. The first cut he produced surely would not have been the end product. The noted tinkerer would have surely been tweaking his film right up to its release date. But death robbed him of that opportunity. And left his final film a bit messy. With some clear, rather easy fixes Eyes Wide Shut could have been a real success. But Kubrick wasn't around to patch it together. And the result is a film which is a bit of a letdown.Eyes Wide Shut is often labeled an erotic thriller. It's a label which doesn't fit. There's nothing particularly erotic about it. Unfortunately not much thrilling either. It's a story of Dr. Bill Harford's journey into a bizarre sexual underground, a world in which he clearly does not belong. What does Bill hope to find? He's sent careening along this path by the revelation that his wife fantasized about cheating on him. Just thought about it, she didn't actually do anything. And this throws Bill completely for a loop. Which strains credulity a bit as you would think the seemingly grounded doctor should be able to handle this revelation which isn't much of a revelation at all. Instead he goes out looking for...something. He doesn't really know what. What he finds himself caught up in is not at all what he bargained for.There's a sense of mystery to Bill's journey, especially once he stumbles his way inside a bizarre sexual cult. Yes, it's that scene, the scene which got all the attention when the movie was released. The infinitely bizarre, mysterious orgy scene. What the heck is going on here? Who are these people? And what price will Bill pay for his intrusion? The tension in this sequence is thick. But ultimately, much like the movie as a whole, it fizzles out with a very anticlimactic feel. There are more mysteries and possible conspiracies to come but by this point in the movie we'd really like Kubrick to make some sense of all of this. And he never really manages to do so satisfactorily. The movie is very slowly paced. A long, at times laborious, trip. And the ending falls rather flat. With more time to work on the film Kubrick may well have been able to tighten things up. The ending was never really going to work but if he got to that ending in a different way, with a little more energy driving the film forward, the overall experience would have been much improved. As it is there are enough good things here to remind you why Kubrick was so revered but his final film falls disappointingly short of greatness.Getting this film made was a long, hard journey for Kubrick. And for his stars. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman put a lot into this movie. Cruise is to be commended, his portrayal of Bill is quite good. In playing Bill's wife Kidman hams it up a bit, especially in early scenes where she's drunk or stoned. But she has some good moments too before her character essentially gets out of the way and cedes the stage to Cruise's Bill and his strange journey of discovery. Cruise is really left to carry the film largely by himself, the story belongs to his character. The character doesn't always convince, Bill does some things which quite frankly it is very hard to see a man in his position doing. But Cruise does convince, you buy him as the character even as you question many of the things the character is doing. Kidman is OK with what little she is given to do, Sydney Pollack makes a good impression in a supporting role, but the film really is Cruise's. And Kubrick's of course. The great director's swan song is not exactly what you, or probably he, would have hoped. The story of the making of Eyes Wide Shut was a long, strange one. The movie itself is ultimately a long, strange one. It has its moments but it never quite all comes together.",Eyes Wide Shut
100,gftbiloxi,"Intriguing, But A Secret Kept Too Well",8,18 April 2005,"EYES WIDE SHUT contains considerable nudity, several fairly explicit scenes, and one sexual situation after another. But any one who approaches EYES WIDE SHUT with the idea that it will be sexually arousing is in for an extremely rude awakening. EYES WIDE SHUT is not a sexy film, and (Hollywood marketing men aside) no one in their right mind would describe it as such.The story is intriguing. Upscale New York doctor Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) fall into a drug-laced conversation--and goaded by Bill's rather archaic ideas about female sexuality, Alice reveals that she has had a powerful sexual fantasy about a man she once saw in a hotel. Powerful though the fantasy was, the facts of the matter are much more prosaic: she never spoke to him, never had sex with him, and never saw him again. But the authority with which she describes the fantasy, and the realization that women in general and his wife in particular are capable of contemplating such behavior, sends Bill into an emotional spin.Unable to shake the image of his wife having sex with another man, he prowls the city--and wanders more by accident than design into one sexual situation after another. Accosted by a patient, taunted by drunk men on the street who think he is gay, and even picked up by a prostitute, Bill eventually stumbles into the film's centerpiece: a secret society that gathers for cold-blooded and ritualistic fornication. And once he trespasses upon the society, he suddenly finds that death and destruction follow his every move.There are clearly several metaphors at work in the film. EYES WIDE SHUT essentially presents sex as something that boils under the surface with a ferocity of which we are generally unaware--and then by stages ties sexuality to emotional risk, disease, perversion, cruelty, and ultimately death. It is also flatly Strindbergian in its vision of women, presenting them and their sexuality as irrational elements that must be subdued and reduced to the mechanical lest they lead to absolute destruction. And it is no accident that the story is set at Christmas with its story of a male God born of a virgin woman.But these are only the most obvious of the film's layers. What confuses--and often enrages--viewers is the fact that Kubrick leaves a tremendous amount of wiggle room when it comes to both the story and what it means. There is no clear-cut summation re anything: everything is presented in the most ambivalent manner possible and we are left to draw our own conclusions. And this is as true of the plot as it is of whatever interpretation you attach to it; it winds back upon itself, ultimately frustrating any clear-cut response. One might say that with EYES WIDE SHUT Kubrick tantalizes us with a secret that he keeps entirely too well. I like the film, but people tend to have extremely divided reactions to it, and for that reason I recommend that you rent the film and decide for yourself before making a purchase.In theatrical release, EYES WIDE SHUT was presented in a widescreen ratio; on both VHS and DVD release, however, it is presented in the ratio of a standard television screen. Liner notes indicate that Kubrick intended the film to be seen in that ratio--but even if that is true it is a pity that there is not a widescreen option, for the visual statement of the widescreen theatrical release was somewhat more powerful. If you are trying to decide between DVD and VHS and both price and DVD bonus materials are factors in your choice, you should know that there is no significant difference between the two.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Eyes Wide Shut
101,aciessi,Fidelio,10,18 January 2018,"It was Stanley Kubrick's final film.. and what a film it was. The Kubrick filmography after 2001: A Space Odyssey was big budgeted, highly conceived and highly anticipated event pictures. Eyes Wide Shut was given none of the pomp and circumstance in it's marketing campaign and neither was there any in the production phase. If anything, Eyes Wide Shut is a bookend to Kubrick's beautiful cinematic journey. It's a throwback, in many aspects, to the Film Noir wave of the 1950's, of which Kubrick made his name being apart of. In the genres of romance, mystery and suspense, Eyes Wide Shut remains to be one of the greatest films of it's kind ever made.But why? Simply, it's about the minimalism. It's actors are tabloid hollywood caliber, it's sets and locations are based in the everyday and yet Eyes Wide Shut is hauntingly extraordinary. In short, it's dreamlike. The way Kubrick tackles sexual paranoia cuts to core of what every man and woman fears when they are in a monogamous relationship. Kubrick illustrates these fears through the metaphor of the sex cult that Tom Cruise's character visits. Of course, that scene has become famous in it's grandiose imagination and unforgettable mis-en-scene. But the sex cult was never intended to be taken at face value. In fact, many viewers mistakenly assumed that that was what the entire film was centered on. In reality, the cult was just one of the many sexual tests that Cruise is forced to take.Cruise, over the course of the picture is put though a gauntlet of sexual temptation. For instance, visiting the house of the NYC prostitute, or the scene of the emotionally wrought, sexually starving widow of a dead patient. One of the most striking tests for me was the scene in which Cruise buys the costume from Rainbow Fashions, only to discover that the owner has a nymphomaniac of a daughter who he catches with a duo of Asian businessmen. She looks on at Cruise, with a flirtatious grin, telling him without saying a word, that he can have her anytime he wants. Kubrick explores sexual temptations from the covert to the overt and psychotically, the audience is challenged as well. How much would you get away with without your wife or husband knowing? On top of that, Kubrick asks an even scarier question. Are monogamous relationships a sham? Are we all just sexual creatures waiting for the next person to mate with? Nicole Kidman's monologue on her desire to cheat on her own husband is forever chilling. Kubrick, by no uncertain terms wants us to know that women can be just as sexually repressed, and potentially, just as unfaithful if they ever wanted to be.I'll never forget the experience of watching Eyes Wide Shut, and neither will anyone else who watches it. It's the definitive swan song of the career of a man changed cinema as we knew it.",Eyes Wide Shut
102,Stampsfightclub,Kubrick rattles off another genre in close look upon sexual desire,8,25 May 2009,"After his wife's confession of lust towards another man, Doctor Will Harford (Cruise) sets out on a voyage of sexual desires and adventures.Stanley Kubrick had certainly made a name for himself over the past few decades, ticking off genres with some splendid direction and filming that rattled cages and drew hefty debates amongst many critiques. He mastered the horror with The Shining, the sci-fi with 2001 and many others right up until this, where he aimed to tick the romance genre off his list. Sadly the American died shortly after presenting this to the distributer and so 10 years on, it is comforting to know he achieved something remarkable in the genre.Eyes Wide Shut is debated as one of Kubrick's worst pictures. From the upside down sequence in 2001 to the blood flowing elevator montage in The Shining, Kubrick was artistically driven, a perfectionist and this is, apparently, where he falls short in the 1999 release. There are no wondrous experimentations, minimal elaborate scene stealing montages or anything otherwise to suggest it is the same person who directed numerous Oscar nominated pictures. So this would presumably be the reason for the critical analysis, but the absence of the camera doesn't dissolve any promise or prospect from the film. Actually, the lack of sweeping scenes brings the film right down to earth.The story is after all a love story, a mature look upon a married couples lives with the use of drugs, sex and parenting to bring a strong level of realistic lifestyle to the picture. The scripting therefore requires little elaboration. There are many consistent montages with the couple, the close up of Kidman's confession is well executed by the director and one fine scene appears when Cruise enters the burlesque house. The sweeping smart approach to the masked personas is very well handled and the sharp music helps generate a feeling of chills and intensity.The whole sex concept is a highly interesting look upon human sexuality and desire, a depiction of lust, trust and intrigue. This is consistently debated throughout, and worth hanging on to right to the question raising climax.The music score is not on the level of say 2001 but it fits the mood of the script nicely. The strong piano strikes may infuriate edgy viewers but do settle the story into a state of intensity and drama.Cruise gives yet another strong performance as the likable Doctor but Kidman is so infuriatingly boring you may look away. The drug taking sequence is a brave attempt to spice her stereotype up, but is driven way out of proportion.Like all Kubrick pictures, there is a great mystery to solve come the end of the film, and just like Kubrick, he has rattled off another genre with a fine justification of romance.",Eyes Wide Shut
103,CharltonBoy,Kubrick saved his best till last.,9,28 February 2002,"There is something about Eyes wide Shut that had me transfixed through out the movie. Was it the acting that made me love this film or was it the story ? Was it the dialogue ot was it just the sight of the Beautifull Nicole kidman? All of these reasons and more are why i cant recommend Eyes Wide Shut highly enough. Stanley Kubrick was not my cup of tea , i think lots of his movies are far to pretentious but he saved his best movies to last without a doubt. If your expecting a fast moving flick that has you on the edge of your seat then this is not for you but if it is film that is spell binding and thought provoking you are after then you have found it with this stunningly visual film. Not to be missed. 9 out of 10.",Eyes Wide Shut
104,gbheron,Poor Showing for Kubrick (Spoiler),5,24 April 2001,"Had ""Eyes Wide Shut"" been released as a companion piece to ""A Clockwork Orange"", Kubrick might have been able to connect with his audience. In the early '70s, a cinematic 'pushing the envelope' was an end in itself; the story vehicle was often secondary. You just had to push. And at that point in time, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" would have been doing just that, challenging the audience with a new type of film, new ideas. By 2000, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is pushing nothing and telling its story poorly.  It's a challenge to keep your eyes open.One problem is that of motivation, both on the character's part and that of the director. For example, why does the Nicole Kidman character confess of an affair she might have had, but didn't? Out of the blue to her stoned husband? The characters just don't act logically. And for Mr. Kubrick, why does he shoot what he does?  Why does he think that watching Ms. Kidman wipe herself adds to the story? Weird.And the story's high point...rich New Yorkers holding super-secret dress-up soirées to screw whores. I don't think so. As a long-term ex-pat in Europe Mr. Kubrick must have gotten confused...and should have set the story in Brussels.Bottom line: watch ""Paths of Glory"" for a fifth time instead.",Eyes Wide Shut
105,TOMASBBloodhound,"Not Stanley's best, but still pretty good.",8,27 December 2003,"Eyes wide shut will be the last piece of greatness we will ever have the privilege of experiencing from Stanley Kubrick. Unfortunately, it was released into a world expecting shallow, brainless thrillers, and pointless vanity pieces from untalented actors and directors. The public at large had no idea what to make of this very fine work when it hit theaters in 1999. ""pointless"" is the word I kept hearing from anyone who saw it before I did. Such a shame.Eyes wide shut is like most of Kubrick's work. It flows like a stream happy to be churning along at its own pace. One cannot simply dangle their toes into the water and get a true feeling for it though. You must jump all the way in and let it take you for a ride. That said, I still think the pace of this film was a little too slow. I think the point could have been made, along with all of the emotions being conveyed, in under two hours. Some of the scenes drag out for a few minutes longer than they need to.The acting was a little stiff, and at times unconvincing. Tom Cruise, however, does and outstanding job. He really carries this film a lot longer than a host of other leading men could have. Kidman really didn't impress me with her performance. She isn't in nearly as many scenes as Cruise, and she comes off as being kind of ditzy in the ones she's in. Not just in the one where they smoke pot. None of the supporting performances are all that memorable either, but they probably weren't meant to be.The story is what really makes this one so memorable. We see a confident, professional man driven to near madness when his wife admits to fantasizing about leaving him and their child for another man she only saw briefly at a hotel. Cruise is understandably upset by this revelation, and sets out to get laid to spite her with anyone he can find. He wanders the streets for hours, and eventually ends up at some wild orgy at a country mansion. Then, things really get interesting.The film is like most Kubrick films in that it is technically awesome and emotionally ambiguous. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide what constitutes adultery and what can simply be written off as a harmless dream or fantasy. One could have a conversation with someone else about these issues for hours and hours.I must take issue with one of the ideas expressed in this film. Kidman's character would have us believe that women are just as much after sex as men, and that they are just as capable of committing adulterous thoughts and actions as men. WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! If you women thought about sex or wanted to have sex as mush as us guys, the world would cease to function. That orgy at the country mansion would be happening all over the world non-stop. Overall, a clever, thoughtful film that should be in any DVD collection. I would stop short of calling it a masterpiece, though. It just falls a little short of that distinction.ps: There are a lot of hot women in this film. Notice how all of them (including Nicole) are tall with perfect breasts. My compliments to the casting director!8 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound.",Eyes Wide Shut
106,The_Movie_Cat,Colour-Coded Coda,8,22 September 1999,"Stanley Kubrick's 17th and final film as director, Eyes Wide Shut felt like his equivalent of Scorcese's ""After Hours"". Both relatively low-key works directed by outstanding professionals, concerning a series of interconnected and ever-more bizarre incidents that befall one man in the underside of life.Where Kubrick's differs is that it has no thread of humour and takes a dark and regularly disturbing path. Interestingly, the action can be largely predicted by the colours used within. For longing and inactivity there is a blue hue shrouding the players. For unrestrained sexual desire and activity there are oranges and autumn reddish shades, be they the lighting or the backdrop.In the middle of this is Cruise, spectacularly turning his back on the macho roles of ""Top Gun"" that have held him down for so long. There are points at the beginning of the movie where he looks a little strained, as with Kidman at the end of the film, though this can be largely put down to Kubrick's 50-100 takes, and both generally give career-best performances.On the negative side, some of the incidental music is too instrusive, particularly the piano stabs, which seem to want to be Psycho-Jaws with bells on; though there is a neat joke that Kubrick pulls twice by having the soundtrack playing, only for Cruise to turn it down as part of a CD in the film. There is a nice use of fades to break the scenes cleanly, and scenes are sustained, though often the jump cuts are botched and the film literally jumps and crackles and one piece of film follows another. Who did the editing on this one, Edwards Scissorhands?Ultimately, if the film gets bad press then it would be in the wake of being the arguably the most-hyped Kubrick movie, save A Clockwork Orange, and an anti-climax (no pun intended) is inevitable. After two years in production we had a right to expect a classic, and Eyes Wide Shut isn't it. Though while not scaling the heights of the aforementioned ""Orange"", or even living up to ""2001"" or ""Dr. Strangelove"" (how many films could?), Eyes Wide Shut is still a worthy film to enter the Kubrick canon and a worthwhile film for him to end his career on. His autumn years never produced such genius (his previous film, Full Metal Jacket, was, let's be truly honest, nothing outstanding), and Eyes Wide Shut is probably the best of his last four directoral works. One of the major problems is that it doesn't seem to have anything to say, although it's interesting how some intervention occurs every time Cruise tries to conduct extra-marital conduct, as if some moral guardian angel is watching over him. While the amount of sexual debauchery can seem far-fetched, the actual sexual act is overplayed on advance publicity and actually has very little involvement in the final product. The much-discussed ""orgy"" (childishly and detractingly edited for American release), is over in little over a minute, and strains towards art rather than pornography, as one would expect from Kubrick's stature.Warning - possible spoiler ahead. The largest weakness in the movie is the sense of pointlessness at the climax. While, again like ""After Hours"", this film has an off-beat denouement, this one has no singing ""Is that all there is?"" to enforce the irony and subsequently falls flat. Almost like a game, we have followed the three big stars (Cruise-Kidman-Kubrick) through 2 hours, 39 minutes of intoxicating plotting only to find we're supposed to wake up sober and leave the theatre on the nearest exit to your right. A dissapointment, but not enough to destroy what is still a fine achievement.",Eyes Wide Shut
107,harry-76,Mask and Face,5,22 August 2000,"Can an actor's character mask ever become his real-life face?  It would seem so, judging by Tom Cruise's ""Special Feature"" interview on the DVD of ""Eyes Wide Shut."" As Cruise reflects upon his experiences in making the film and his relationship with Director Stanley Kubrick, one senses the actor hasn't fully shed his role.  The low tones of his voice, the deliberate and interminable pacing of his lines, and the introspective and diffident attitude and mannerisms of his delivery all seem to be those of Dr. William ""Bill"" Harford carried over to real life.  Indeed, at one point in reflecting upon his first learning of Kubrick's death, Cruise appears to almost uncontrollably recapitulate the start of Dr. Bill's emotional ""release"" scene from the film's climax.Perhaps it's only natural, after having spent eighteen intense months (longer including the preparatory period) with this character, being in every scene, and all the while under the powerful influence of Kubrick.Anyone who might think acting is a fairly easy can view this interview footage and observe the challenges demanded by the craft. When Laurence Olivier was once asked whether it was better to take the character home or leave it at the stage door, Olivier responded the latter.Perhaps techniques in de-programming might be as beneficial as actual character development to the actor's work.  At least one hopes Mr. Cruise will follow this up with some light comedies.",Eyes Wide Shut
108,Angry_Arguer,Patient Depth,8,19 September 2004,"Kubrick was possibly our most mature filmmaker in both form and ideas. He proved that story was not necessary in '2001' and 'Barry Lyndon'. His artistic and technical perfectionism is still relevant today (compare the grandeur of spacecraft in '2001' to Lucas' cartoons in 'Episode II') and, despite what anyone will tell you, his stuff is_not_boring.OK, so 'Spartacus' was a bunch of moralistic hoo-ha and 'Shining' was too safe. Big deal. Let's get to the good stuff.Spoiler minefield ahead...Kubrick works in a very contemplative mode. He doesn't have the penchant for editing that those in my ""cinematic excess"" category do. In this respect, Kubrick is one of the most personal directors I have experienced. He doesn't create characters by having them spout lines in a cut-and-paste fashion like most directors. He wants them to exist, hence the mountains of laborious takes.Of course, characters themselves are irrelevant in Kubrick's work (again with the '2001' reference). They are about situations and tone. Is it fear? Passion? Insanity? Why do you think his work hits some emotion/psychological bells in our heads? It's not because it's Jack Nicholson.Watch this and notice how Kubrick rewards our patience. You might enjoy it.",Eyes Wide Shut
109,mitsubishizero,Bizarre,7,11 August 2019,"Where to begin with this film... it's not bad I mean I think it's interesting but man... It's very surreal viewing this. This was the last film Stanley Kubrick directed before his tragic passing and I have to say I think it's a good film to go out on. The story's about a happily married couple Dr. Bill and Alice Harford (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) who attend a Christmas party in New York. After they come home they discuss their fantasies while high on weed. At first it's innocent until Alice admits one of hers involving a naval officer in Cape Cod. This shocks Bill who decides to sleep with someone. This leads him to a bizarre masked orgy where he almost dies had a mysterious woman not sacrifice herself for him.Afterwards he begins to fear for his life wondering if he's being watched and in danger or not. From this point on it gets really bizarre. The film has a dreamlike feel which keeps you hypnotized. The orgy scene's very surreal yet unsurprisingly erotic. There're a lot of scenes that are hilarious like the scene where when Bill is returning his costume, the store owner, Mr. Milich (Rade Serbedzija) kicks out 2 customers and puts them under a citizens arrest for screwing with his daughter (Leelee Sobieski) yet it's also gross because she looks underage and it doesn't help that in a later scene it's implied they worked something out when Bill notices the same men are there. The actors do a good job conveying the dreamlike yet menacing feel to the movie. Tom Cruise does well playing the busy yet charming Dr. Bill searching for the ultimate conquest.Eyes Wide Shut is an interesting yet bizarre film. It's not bad as it has an interesting style and is interesting to watch but it's weird and even uncomfortable at times. If you like art films I suggest you check this one out.",Eyes Wide Shut
110,DukeEman,Welcome to upper-middle class angst with Bill and Alice.,9,16 August 1999,"That clever cheeky bugger Mr. Kubrick knew what he was doing when casting top line stars Tom and Nicole in his final masterpiece. He was aiming for a wide audience, specifically hetero couples and that he achieved. With the presence of the stars this movie will reach its audience in suburbia. That's were I saw it and the cinema was full of couples. At the end of the movie you could hear a pin drop as we all filed out with our heads hanging down in either astonishment or outrage paranoia. I viewed this movie with my wife and never have we discussed a movie so deeply afterwards. But the discussion went beyond the movie as we dwelled into our own relationship. Were do you draw the line between sexual fantasy and realism? Do men go beyond the point of sexual fulfilment? Or are men just a natural hunter in search of a prey that normally is its own self? Dr. Bill, (Tom), goes on a primitive hunt to satisfy his urge of curiosity after his wife Alice tells him of a sexual fantasy she had about a sailor. While hers was a fantasy, (or was it?), his will be reality, (or is it?), for revenge purposes. Instead Dr. Bill is lead on a crusade that takes him on a journey beyond his outer-comfort-limits. He enters a sexual world that only man can wish for and only receive in dreams. Kubrick succeeds in challenging the Hetero world with questions that need to be looked into deeply. As with all Kubrick films the images range from straight narrative to the surreal when it is necessary. This is mostly Dr. Bill's perspective that left him with eyes wide shut during the orgy sequence. Tom's performance as Dr. Bill was one of his finest. At first he seems out of his depth but you soon realise that his performance is based on the social appearance of pretence that is soon replaced by the personal and strong performance when he discovers Alice's fantasy and is swept away in the journey. Nicole is brilliant in a small but important role. In the end I had to laugh at Kubrick's brilliance. Maybe I misread it but the movie was left open for any interpretation. As far as I'm concern, a movie is the patient and the audience the Therapist.",Eyes Wide Shut
111,mario_c,Open your eyes to this masterpiece!,10,19 May 2008,"The last film directed by Stanley Kubrick, EYES WIDE SHUT, is a masterpiece, or by other words, a magnificent way for a director to finish is career. This film is too straight to follow, but at the same time very complex, because it's a deep reflection about a couple's relationship and intimacy. It's about love, jealous, matrimony, loyalty, and adventures outside matrimony, whether ""they are real or in dreams"" The viewer watches the plot through Dr. William Harford's mind (played by Tom Cruise) and we feel his fears, his tension, his insurance about his matrimony and the loyalty of his wife. We can feel the tension growing and how lost he is! His wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), is also lost and confused, but she's controlling the game, to the point of testing him, telling him an affair she once had with a sailor man But did it really happen, or is she just telling her sexual fantasy to instigate him, to make him jealous? I think the end answers that! Aside from their relationship, this movie is also great for many other reasons! It's mysterious, suspenseful, odd and mystical! The scene where occurs that weird and mysterious party is amazing, because it creates a magnificent ambiance of seduction and mystery, but also obscurity and weirdness. No one knows who is who, behind those creepy and sinister masks, what increases the mystery. The ceremony scene is simply astonishing. Together, the music, the voices, the masks, the women, and the ritual it self create this bizarre and mystical ambiance, that is so seductive at the same time. It's one of my favourite's scenes ever I must say! From all types of cinema, from all movies I ever saw! The acting is great, especially by Tom Cruise, which does one of the best roles of his long and succeeded career. His character is quite lost, scared and confused and he plays it very well. Nicole Kidman also does a good job, playing his tempting wife.The soundtrack is amazing! I know it's not an original OST, since it's a very well known classical piece, but it's just brilliant, providing suspense and tension to the film.This movie is a masterpiece, and it resumes it all!",Eyes Wide Shut
112,tonypeacock-1,One last hurrah from Kubrick evokes memories,8,7 April 2019,"Legendary director Stanley Kubrick's last film. Delivered to film distributor Warner Bros. some four days before his death after a laborious 400 day shoot.In ways typical Kubrick. However this film has erotic undertones. Indeed the two main characters were married in real life at the time.I have mixed views of Kubrick films. He is a cinema legend up there with the likes of Hitchcock in my opinion.In ways this is a thriller that reminded me of a Hitchcock film with an adult undertone.
Cruise plays a doctor, Doctor Harford who is shaken by a drug fuelled revelation by his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman).What follows is a seedy night of events as the doctor tries to come to terms with the revelation.I say seedy. Fears of homosexuality, under age sex, prostitution, HIV infection and murder are all covered briefly as the revelation keeps flashing in his mind. That of a fantasy of his wife.The film has excellent set design and a simple but effective musical score, including classical music that is pure Kubrick.

Like that film, the plot here is threadbare and serves only to observe the relationship between two lovers. In this case we see how the the two partners in the relationship react to imagined and almost fait accompli infidelities.

Kuberick didn't exactly save the best for last, but Eyes wide shut is still a worthy entry in this great director's resum'e.Cruise and Kidman, who were married, play a married couple. One night while they're high, they get into an argument and this leads for her to admit that she ALMOST had an affair once.

And the morning after, he has to unlock the mysteries of it.A lot goes on in Eyes wide shut that could've been told in an hour and forty-five minutes, but its in 2 and a half hours. The scenes between Kidman and Cruise seems to last an eternity. Actually, a lot of the scenes feel that way. Also, some of the film doesn't add up. What you think will happen, actually doesn't, and you feel sort of let down.But I was interested in the film. I had more fun predicting the outcome than I actually did in the film. I think Eyes wide shut goes back to Kuberick's A clockwork orange time and runs with it. Eyes wide shut is a dark, bizarre, and interesting thriller. Despite its flaws.B+",Eyes Wide Shut
115,Movie-12,Hypnotic intensity; absorbing performances; perfect direction; one of the greatest films of all time. **** (out of four),9,7 November 2000,"Stanley Kubrick's last film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a cross between an exotic fantasy and mysterious illuminating thriller. The movie also resembles a dream, whether it be a nightmare or preoccupation, as various characters drift in and out of focus during two nights of sexual exploration where opportunities are missed, and or avoided. Audiences have complained about lack of story, immaturity of characters, and slow moving atmosphere, but those elements are what make ""Eyes Wide Shut"" distinct: the story is not so much a plot other than a series of events that transpire each other through identity clarification; the characters are extraordinarily deep and involving, mostly because there are too many loose ends for our attention to stop paying attention. This is one of the best movies of the year, possibly decade, another landmark achievement by one of the best American directors of all time.True couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are the wealthy Dr. Bill and Alice Harford, who are raising a seven year old daughter in Manhattan. During the film's long, indolent opening sequence, the two attend a society ball thrown in the costly mansion of Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack). There, Bill meets an old friend from medical school, Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), now a pianist. During the party, Bill is nearly seduced by two aggressive, shapely woman and a tall, suave Hungarian tries to sweet talk a drunken Alice. This occurs before Victor requires the medical assistance of Bill after a hooker overdoes in the middle of sexuality.This first half hour is slow and stretchy, but luminous and necessary to develop the intentions and suspicious of characters later on in the story. For instance, when the party is over and Alice and Bill return home, and in their bedroom, stoned on pot, she questions his fidelity using enough perverse terns to startle fans of ""Cruel Intentions."" She eventually admits to fantasizing over a young naval officer she witnessed the summer before while she and Bill where visiting Cape Cod. ""At no time was he ever out of my mind,"" reveals Alice, ""And I thought if he wanted me, only for one night, I was ready to give up everything .""It is here where the audience realizes the conflict is the current tension between Alice and Bill. Alice's secret confession is tantalizingly tense as we witness the jumble of emotions in which Bill experiences. This scene is important, and well crafted, and propels the plot into the second act where various, well-structured plot points occur.From this point on our attention is captivated and the film never loosens its grip on the erotically appealing style and an odd, unsettling, sometimes lewd mood for the characters. The film is shot in high-contrast style, with back-lighting, underlighting and convincing primary colors. The story takes place near Christmas so the filmmakers can take advantage of the fantastic holiday tone.Propelled by flashbacks of his wife making love with the naval officer, it is at this point where Bill begins his two night sexual odyssey, entering a world in which nearly everyone reacts to him sexually. He first stumbles upon Marion (Marie Richardson), who's father, an old patient of his, has recently died. She tries to seduce him literally on her father's death bed. Vinessa Shaw plays a particularly friendly hooker in which he has an alleged encounter, maybe intercourse, maybe not. Milich (Rade Sherbedgia) is an eccentric, patriarch costume store owner who seems to be advertising sexual favors for his young daughter (Leelee Sobieski). Arranged by Nick, Bill is then given the password to a secret country house orgy, in which he watches, but never experiences, ritual-like sexual activities. He later comes in contact with a queer hotel clerk (Alan Cumming), who makes it clear that he finds Bill attractive.The film's story feels as if it revolves around the illustrative orgy sequence in a country estate, where Bill wanders around viewing masked individuals performing a variation of sexual acts with each other. This sequence is of the best ever witnessed in film; it has extraordinary intensity and hypnotic suspense. The cinematography is eye candy for the mind; the architecture is dreamlike in appearance. This tantalizing famous scene has undergone digital alterations to hide the most graphic sexual content. The more explicit sex is seen in question from a distance, and is more for the imagination to ponder upon rather than actual acts. If these alternations where not made, the MPAA would have slapped this masterpiece with an unwanted NC-17 rating. However, even with the cuts ""Eyes Wide Shut"" deserves an NC-17 rating with the profound amount of nudity and sexual explicitness. This movie is strictly intend for adults to experience. Warner Bros. has sacrificed Stanley Kubrick's masterful vision in order to make the film more appropriate to younger viewers. That is a joke.The film is true Kubrick material; the way he pays attention to each individual scene and character; the aggressive and perverse sexual content; the ample amounts of female nudity. All elements follow tradition with his pervious achievements, such as ""A Clockwork Orange."" Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are perfection as they explore themes of morality, sorrow, remorse, emotion, grief, seduction, jealousy, pleasure, and love. Kubrick also produced and co-wrote the production; with precise, distinct dialogue, Alice's confession scene has intense verve. Stanley Kubrick knew exactly what he wanted with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and it appears he got it.Stanley Kubrick tragically passed away in March of 2000. We lost a true component to the defining of American cinema. It is hard to believe he would have accepted the modifications placed on his success. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" should have been released as he made it, regardless of the MPAA mumbo jumbo. Nevertheless, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is an engaging, memorable and haunting experience for mature audiences only. Kubrick has constructed his final contribution to audiences and fans everywhere, and it is one of his most artful and brilliant. He will be missed for the great director he was.",Eyes Wide Shut
116,virek213,Kubrick misunderstood again. So what else is new?!,9,21 July 2001,"EYES WIDE SHUT was the last film director Stanley Kubrick worked on before his untimely death on March 7, 1999.  And given that virtually all of his films have been misunderstood on first initial viewings, it isn't surprising that this psychosexual drama, containing nudity and sexual content coming just within a stone's throw of being classified as soft-porn, should arouse widely divergent views.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are a very upscale Manhattan couple who, following a lavish party at the home of a good friend (Sydney Pollack), debate sexual infidelities after Cruise is spotted by Kidman flirting with a couple of models.  What follows is an odyssey of sexual tensions for Cruise, including a very strange, almost Edgar Allan Poe-inspired ritual at a Long Island mansion featuring many naked people.I really can't go into any further detail about EYES WIDE SHUT.  I believe it to be a fitting end to the life's work of one of the greatest post-World War II film makers.  But it is a very complex film, not easy to describe in simple terms.  Kubrick is deliberately ambiguous in his approach to the material (inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle""), which I think is what really bewilders, if not angers, a lot of people.  Like everything Kubrick has made, it requires repeat viewings to get the full impact.  It is very lengthy, and its nudity and language make it very unsuitable for anyone under the age of 17.  Otherwise, however, EYES WIDE SHUT is at the very least one of the most intriguing films from a director who clearly inspired many other great ones, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Brian DePalma.",Eyes Wide Shut
117,alice liddell,"Stanley Kubrick was the one director to have only directed masterpieces: the more you think about this deceptive film, the more this might be still true.",8,13 September 1999,"For the first half of this film I was reeling in disbelieving dismay.  What had happened to the great Stanley Kubrick, along with Peckinpah and Burton the great American director of the last forty years?  The old style now lacked any life, lapsing into cod-Felliniisms (sic?); the story was without any real interest; and where the hell was Nicole Kidman when we needed her?Then I realised how wrong I had been.  Many critics have noted, in surprise, how faithful the film is to Schnitzler's trite novella.  This is, I believe, where they were misled.  Only on a superficial level can it truly be called a faithful adaptation.   EYES WIDE SHUT can only be properly appreciated as a Kubrick film.  It's not really an examination of marriage or psychoanalysis, as is the book.  Like LOLITA, 2001, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, BARRY LYNDON and THE SHINING - it concerns the gradual disintegration of a hero who began the movie whole, confident and self-satisfied.In this way, the most helpful references might not be to Freud, but Nabokov and, perhaps bizarrely, Eric Rohmer.  Like Nabokov, especially in Lolita, the assured faith in witness of the hero is constantly undermined.  Unlike the novel, in which Fridolin's peregrinations are unambiguously dreamlike (its title translates as Dream Story), Kubrick takes care to establish the superficial reality of Bill's adventures.  As these go on, though, coincidences, correspondances, nagging implausibilities and absurdities begin to undermine this reality.  The film, like Lolita, is impossibly symmetrical - the first two important scenes (Bill with his family; Bill in a crisis moment with Zeigler)exactly match the last two scenes (except for Bill's power in them); and there is an elegant patterning and repetition throughout.  The ludicrous, Victorian, 'motivation' of a novel called Dream Story is completely weeded out, and characters are reduced to ciphers, as is appropriate to a dream.This is where Rohmer comes in.  His films, on a superficial level, concern bright young things talking talking talking about sex and philosophy, but his use of colour, framing and allusion (paintings, books, films, songs etc.) tell a completely different story.  Similarly here.  The crucial sequence is the opening party at Ziegler's.  Everything in Bill's 'dream' that follows springs from this.  For instance, the models that invite Bill for a menage-a-trois promise him a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow: in his plot, the costume shop he visits is called Rainbow.Most important is the scene with Ziegler in the bathroom.  For a start, the room is covered in mirrors.  On one level is a naked, possibly dead, girl on an armchair; on another is a painting of a sprawling naked woman (I thought it was by Matisse, but I couldn't find it when I looked it up later). Already slightly drunk, and aroused after the models, can you imagine the effect of these two naked women multiply reflected in all those mirrors must have on Bill?  This mixture of profuse nudity, and fear of death, ring throughout his 'dream'.Secondly, the rich red of the painting echoes throughout Bill's adventures, colouring everything unrealistically, especially the orgy scene, and Ziegler's billiards room, completely undermining the latter's 'explanation'. This is a wonderful scene, completely misunderstood by Kubrick devotee Michael Dwyer.The film operates as an Oedipal story in reverse.  In (simplistic) Freudian terms, to enter into society, a man must symbolically kill his father and marry a mother substitute.  This Bill utterly fails to do.  Ziegler is the father figure here, and Bill at the opening is forced to confront his father, having just completed the primal scene.  His subsequent attempts throughout the film, to 'marry' this 'mother' result only in her death, and Ziegler's increased superiority.  As a son grows older, he is supposed to see flaws in his father, see that he doesn't have the answers to everything. But in the billiards room scene, Ziegler CAN answer everything, he is total control, like a father correcting an errant child.Bill ends the film reduced to the childlike level of his daughter, in tears, totally dependent on, and at the mercy of, his wife ('mother').  If this is optimistic, as everyone has been claiming, than I'm Stanley Kubrick. Obviously not everything here fits - one would hope not, and I have only seen the film once, so give me a break.  The emphasis on the hero at the expense of the heroine might seem misogynistic, but that would be to miss the point of the film's deconstruction.One of the film's structural motifs is storytelling.  Foucault once linked epistomology and sex, and here almost every character  has a story to tell, a way of controlling and shaping experience.  Everyone except Bill, who must find his own story (linked to his having sex).  However he keeps being waylaid by others' (especially his wife's), and his own 'conclusion' (Ziegler's explanation) does the opposite of what he had hoped: it emasculates and infantilises him.On a simply entertainment level, EYES WIDE SHUT is a joy.  As I've said elsewhere, it's been an atrocious year for cinema, so it's enrapturing to see a genuine master in mature, if not absolutely outstanding, form. Kubrick's famous tracking shots, besides being so aesthetically breathtaking in themselves, create a real sense of the steady ground moving from under the characters' feet, slowly slipping away.  The film is very VERY funny, especially in its use of doomladen piano music in the orgy scene and after in Bill's head whenever a crisis point occurs (the orgy should not be taken as literal and 'daring', but as a centring of the signifiers and anxieties whirring in Bill's head), as well as the mocking insertion of old favorites such as 'Strangers In The Night'.  Shostakovitch's glorious Waltz from Jazz Suite No. 2, the film's musical motif, is gorgeously evocative, as well as being, appropriately, a parodic pastiche (and impossible to get out of your head).The scenes between Kidman and Cruise are remarkable and painful;  one never had Kubrick down as such a perceptive artist of domestic comedy (although THE SHINING should have been a clue).  Nicole Kidman is truly brilliant in a difficult role, but Tom Cruise is strangely perfect, his smug persona wonderfully sent up (see especially the scene where he gives the prosititute/student 'compensation'), his eventual reduction after his confession to a little boy truly convincing.  Since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick films have invariably received initially unfavorable reviews, only for subsequent viewings to reveal them as astonishing masterworks (BARRY LYNDON and THE SHINING are the pinnacles of modern cinema).  I would not be remotely surprised if the same thing happened with this film.",Eyes Wide Shut
118,FlickJunkie-2,Defective screenplay brilliantly filmed,7,17 March 2000,"It is unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick who has given us so many brilliant films (`Spartacus'; `2001, A Space Odyssey'; `A Clockwork Orange'; `The Shining'; `Full Metal Jacket'), should end his career with this one.  The biggest problem with this film is the screenplay, which is all the more perplexing since Kubrick helped write it.  It is hard to comprehend how such a masterful filmmaker could miss the mark by such a wide margin.
Let me begin by saying that the technical aspects of this film were superb to the point of being superhuman.  Kubrick's camera work was pure genius. The color and lighting were impeccable; incomparable in their impact and effect as well as their beauty.  Anyone who has seen this film should go back and watch it again and just notice the way the sets are lighted, how the shadows are cast, how the rooms in the background are bathed in soft blue with contrasting colored lights perfectly splashed in to heighten the effect.  As far as the sound, Kubrick can do more with the well placed single note of a piano than most directors can do with an entire orchestra.That being said, the script can only be described as grossly disappointing. There were really two stories here.  The first is the story of Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice (Nicole Kidman) Harford's relationship.  The second was the story of Bill's sexual odyssey resulting in his crashing of an orgy for the rich and famous.  Too much was made of the first and not enough of the second.  This should have been a psycho-sexual film noir suspense thriller. The elements were there for a good one.  Bill's penetration of the sordid inner circle of sex games of the powerful could have been a riveting thriller with proper follow through.  But instead, Kubrick chose to deflate this storyline with the unsatisfying dialogue between Bill and Victor (Sidney Pollack).  He then returned to the Harford's relationship, which was a character study in `who cares'.  He ends the film as if their relationship was the point, which left the film pointless.Other than her ability to provide sexy set dressing, Nicole Kidman was utterly superfluous in this film.  Worse yet, this was probably the most wretched performance of her career.  Kidman is not without talent and has given us some excellent performances (`Malice'; `Dead Calm').   Her performance here was tentative and strained, however.  There were times when she was so unnatural in the delivery of her lines, one would have thought she was aphasic.Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance portraying a difficult and tormented character.  It was somewhat of a departure for him to play a character that was so pent up and emotionally torn.  He hasn't taken on a part this difficult since `Born On The Fourth of July'.  Usually he plays the straightforward macho type; more action than depth.  I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to rise to the challenge of this character's complexity.I gave this film a 7/10.  The filmmaking was a 12, but the story was never developed to its full potential.  It would have been interesting to see what Alfred Hitchcock would have done with this story.  Perhaps Stanley and Alfred are talking about that right now.",Eyes Wide Shut
119,Peach-2,A last tip of the hat to the master.,10,18 July 1999,"Stanley Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut, is simply one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. Although the film was in production and shooting for well over two years, the wait has been more than worth it. The master of cinematic atmosphere, Kubrick explores jealousy and sex in Eyes Wide Shut. I have heard that there is both a R-rated and NC-17 rated version, either way the version I saw was powerful and hypnotic. The imagery in this film will be with you for a long time after viewing, and the score is very eerie. Kubrick knows more than any other director how to manipulate an audience, his films are always thought provoking and this film is no exception. The underground sex party is one of the strangest cinematic experiences I have had the pleasure to witness in a very long time. Kubrick was the greatest director ever and this film shows he was never afraid to explore the dark side of the human race. The best film of the decade. You will be missed Mr. Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut
120,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,8 July 2021,"Kubrick once again showing why he's one of the best directors of all time, every minimalist detail is purposefully placed where it is it's fantastic to see how he manages to tell us so much more than we can hear. The film itself doesn't appeal to everyone because it's a bit slow, slow, and doesn't have something as shocking as a twist that leaves you in awe! But we learn many things here, where after all will be the end of the rainbow, will we live a rainbow while there is a reality behind? It's just one of the questions this genius director leaves us.Film seen on the 7th to the 8th of July 2021.",Eyes Wide Shut
121,WriterDave,Frustrating Last Entry from Kubrick,7,3 January 2006,"It's a shame that something as muddled (though fascinating and watchable throughout) as ""Eyes Wide Shut"" would become the last movie directed by possibly the greatest director of all time, Stanley Kubrick. It showcases all the things his detractors had been falsely claiming for years: he's out of steam, it's too long, it's too weird, and it has no point. Unfortunately the film is as overshadowed by the fact that it's Kubrick's last as it is by the fact that it was released at the height of Cruise and Kidman's status as Hollywood's uber-couple. Oh, how we wish Kubrick could be with us today, and how we all thought Tom and Nicole would last forever.Kubrick's look at marriage and fidelity can be boiled down pretty easily: misadventures in unfaithfulness can be equally damaging playing out in one's imagination as they can be in reality. Despite a great, raw, and entrancing performance from Nicole Kidman, the film is pretty much one-sided and dedicates most of its runtime to Tom Cruise's unrealistic though entertaining nightly escapades. Only in a Kubrick film would a man find the prettiest, most polite, kindest hooker in New York City and then just happen upon a huge aristocratic sex cult at some castle/mansion out on Long Island. The whole thing is more kinky than erotic and just a bit silly, which isn't to say it's without its merits.In the end, in spite of its flaws, I think it's rather fitting that the last line of the last film of a director like Kubrick who always had such a dark sense of humor would be, ""f*ck"" and be spoken by one of the most elegant and beautiful and talented actresses of her generation. Sounds like a great idea.",Eyes Wide Shut
122,asda-man,Will leave your eyes were firmly wide open!,9,19 July 2011,"Over ten years later Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is released to the world. I was only four years old at the time, but I could imagine the hype. The final film of arguably the greatest film director to have ever lived. The final cut of Eyes Wide Shut was delivered to Warner Brothers four days prior to Stanley's mysterious death. Stanley called the film his ""greatest contribution to the art of cinema"" but it was greeted with hostility and it's easy to see why. Eyes Wide Shut is arguably his most impenetrable film. The average cinemagoer can appreciate the horror of The Shining and the comedy of Dr. Strangelove without digging deeper into them. However, Eyes Wide Shut is very difficult to enjoy without unlocking those hidden meanings and symbols.It's possibly his most enigmatic and mysterious film, arguably even more so than 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining. The eye-popping finale to 2001 has more or less been unlocked, but the secrets that lie within Eyes Wide Shut still remain closed and debated upon just like The Shining still is today. However, whilst The Shining is universally lauded as a masterpiece, Eyes Wide Shut is still yet to receive the recognition it deserves. I remember when I first saw the film one night, on my own and finding it incredibly slow but intriguing. I also remember finding a lot of it very frightening.Last night I gave it a re-watch with my sister and mother by my side. My sister switched off about twenty minutes in and started playing on her phone, whilst my mother said once it finished ""Well, I'm not surprised he died after making that shite!"" which of course makes no sense, but you don't know my Mum. I definitely found a new appreciation for it though. There's so much going on in the film that it's impossible to take it all in on your first viewing. You'll probably end up disliking it, but give it a few days and you'll find yourself pondering over it. You may even find yourself becoming haunted by it like Dr. Bill's guilty conscience.At its core, Eyes Wide Shut is a Lynchian mystery set in a dreamy New York City. Most know all the bizarre plot twists and turns now, but the less you know the better. Like most Stanley films, Eyes Wide Shut is more of an experience that can't be put into words. It's not the type of film you can dip in and out of, you have to watch it all the way through and give it your full attention. Watching Tom cruise walking down the street shouldn't be interesting, but something about it keeps you inexplicably transfixed to the screen. Similarly, the seemingly never ending monologues carry a hypnotic grip on your senses, such as Nicole's dreamy drug-fuelled confession which kick starts the entire story.The film holds the record for the longest continual film shoot at four hundred days so the directing is of course beyond masterful. Every single shot is carefully considered and the trademark tracking shots are as dizzying as ever. The mise-en-scene in each scene is also extremely important to consider. There are so many things hidden in the background, such as the recurring multi-coloured Christmas trees which disappear once Tom Cruise enters the mysterious cult. Could this relate to the 'end of the rainbow' as stated earlier in the film? It's little details like this which make Eyes Wide Shut endlessly fascinating to analyse. Only until you analyse the film can you appreciate the painstaking details and intelligent intricacies.Stanley's final film is often claimed to be a limp ending to a phenomenal filmography, however I'd strongly disagree. Any true Stanley lover will recognise the obscure genius of Eyes Wide Shut. Conspiracy theorists will thrive off the illuminati and Satanist symbolism, but I think there's more to it than that. It's a wonderfully mysterious film with a brooding dreamlike atmosphere. I also have to mention the brilliantly creepy (yet incredibly simple) piano score which has to be the scariest use of a few notes since the Jaws theme tune. Whilst the film isn't quite up to the impossibly high standards of 2001, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, it isn't miles off. Maybe after some repeated views I might hold it in even higher regards.",Eyes Wide Shut
123,LazySod,terribly slow and mildly agitating,6,6 September 1999,"A doctor and his wife finally discover the strength of their marriage is weakening.

Not a great movie at all and to be honest, a great disappointment as it came from the hands of one of the greater movie makers. Having said this, i'd recommend 'The Ice Storm', dealing with the same subject but far better.",Eyes Wide Shut
124,ronakkotian,An immersive sexual odyssey,8,11 December 2020,"Stanley Kubrick will forever remain a master. So much of his work is respected and The Shining is my favourite horror film of all time. Whilst I didn't love Eyes Wide Shut to that extent, it was still a phenomenal experience.Eyes Wide Shut follows Bill Harford, a New York doctor who embarks on a sexual odyssey during one night when his wife reveals an unpleasant secret to him.Eyes Wide Shut is Kubrick's final film and one I've been hearing about for a long time. The reveption is very split with some hailing it as a masterpiece whilst others think it's terrible. By the end of it, I honestly didn't know what to think of it. It's quite a challenging film and I've been thinking about it ever since. The film is very long and has a slow pace but it's very atmospheric at the same time. There were some parts where the film dragged due to the slow pacing but it also helped me get immersed into the world of the film. The use of colours and the way Kubrick presented the night life transcended me into this dream-like and lust filled world. I also cannot forget how amazing the score was. It brought a creepy and strange feeling to the film that matched perfectly to the bizarre nature of some scenes. The performances were stellar. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman did an excellent job playing a couple that are struggling with all these sexual feelings and the supporting cast also do a fine job.Eyes Wide Shut is a very strange film. There is so much mystery and ambiguity in it that I haven't been able to take my mind off it. It's a film that deals with themes like jealously, sex, infidelity and so much more but I feel I haven't even scratched the surface of the film's deeper meanings. It's sad how this ended up being Kubrick's final film but it's undeniable how talented of a filmmaker and storyteller he is. I'm definitely gonna watch this film a couple more times and I hope people give it a try because it is a fascinating experience.",Eyes Wide Shut
125,cinematic_aficionado,Erotic...,10,1 May 2004,"Eyes Wide Shut is a powerful and highly erotic movie where actually, in my opinion this is what this movie is all about.It shows how two normal people a happily married couple can have their marriage and life ruined by a series of temptations.This movie also is trying to show how powerful sexual desires can be, and when our loved one the one we thought we can take for granted and can take us for granted has been tempted by someone else it really messes our head up.Kubrick last movie is a true masterpiece, because with the multitude of scenes and plots it goes all the way to the depths of our mind when it comes to the biggest off all human instincts: desire!!!10/10",Eyes Wide Shut
126,MichaelMargetis,"""No dream is ever just a dream. "" - Dr. Bill Hartford",5,6 July 2005,"Let's start this review off on a positive note. Stanley Kubrick was the most talented film director to ever walk the face of the earth. It's an extremely bold statement, but I'll stand by it proudly. You see, I've never encountered a filmmaker with such a meticulous and keen vision as Mr. Kubrick's. He truly was a genius and every film he made was a shining example of his wondrous talent. Well, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is his very worst film in my opinion, not to mention his most pretentious. It's a very muddled, confusing, peculiar and most of all boring film, but it presents itself as if it's a masterpiece. Critics raved about it, but the Academy shunned it (a move of the wise in my opinion). Kubrick fans seemed to have split on it, and I'm here to say it's a damn shame this was this brilliant man's last film. 'Eyes Wide Shut' tries to awaken curiosity, be provocative and cause us to think long and hard, but it just ends up being an absolute train wreck. It isn't a bad film, but it is just so upsetting and disappointing since it came from Stanley Kubrick.The warped story follows a rich married couple living it up in a nice apartment in Manhattan. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) is a wealthy, young and handsome M.D. married to a slightly crazy nagging woman, Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman). They seem to be such a perfect couple and have a smart seven-year-old daughter, but they have extreme jealousy issues when it comes to their relationship. Alice is jealous of Bill being with other women, and so is Bill to a certain extent. Just before Christmas, the two get invited to a Christmas party held by Bill's boss, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack). At the party both Bill and Alice find other people they may be attracted to and fight and argue about it later that night. At the party, Bill runs into an old friend of his who dropped out of medical school, Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), who is the piano player/band leader at Ziegler's party. After the party, Bill and Alice have a huge marital fight while smoking marijuana, and in the middle Bill gets a call from the daughter of a patient who passed away. Bill makes a house call to see Marion (Marie Richardson), whose father has passed. After visiting her, he decides to not cut the night short and go out to see Nick Nightingale play at a local bar. The two meet up, and Bill becomes aware of a secret organization which Nick plays piano at, and wants to check it out. Nick lets the password slip and tells Bill the address. Bill checks it out, and it ends up being a secret ceremony people wear costumes and masks too, then have wild sex orgies with various hookers. Bill get's spotted by the leader of the organization and then is threatened not to tell anybody. The film takes a bizarre and hard-to-follow turn after that point, and frankly it looses my interest.'Eyes Wide Shut' isn't a success not due to Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick provides astounding direction as always. His vision is vibrant with color and beauty, and that alone kept me going throughout the film's two hour and forty-minute runtime. The acting from the two leads isn't that great. Tom Cruise is absolutely dreadful in his role, and is anything but believable as a doctor. Nicole Kidman is nothing better then average, but her screen time is way more limited then you probably would anticipate. The supporting cast is good though, with strong performances from Sydney Pollack, Todd Field, Vinessa Shaw (as a beautiful prostitute Bill takes a liking to), Rade Serbedzija (as a costume shop owner), Leelee Sobieski (as the costume shop owner's daughter) and Broadway actor Alan Cumming as an eccentric and entertaining to watch hotel desk clerk. The writing in 'Eyes Wide Shut' drags repeatedly, and it's of a quality so low I'm absolutely shocked Stanley Kubrick wrote it! Although the film's cinematography as music score are incredible, it can't really make up for a drawn-out and tiring storyline. Supposedly it took Stanley Kubrick a long time to make this, and that definitely shows because of how jumbled and hard to follow the film is.In conclusion, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a film for Kubrick fans only. Others will roll their eyes and sigh through the drawn-out pretentious movie 'Eyes Wide Shut' is. Even though there is a lot of intriguing scenes buried within 'Eyes Wide Shut' they never really seem to redeem the constant dragging of the film. It seems as though there is two or three movies going on at one time in 'Eyes Wide Shut' because the film never really blends into together well. I'm going to cut 'Eyes Wide Shut' more credit then it could possibly deserve because it has the great Stanley Kubrick's name on it. Kubrick really does a fine job with the directing aspect of 'Eyes Wide Shut', but the film lacks almost everything else. 'Eyes Wide Shut' ended up being a disappointment of colossal proportions, and that's an absolute shame seeing as though it was our world's finest film director's last motion picture.

127,bgar-80932,Not a classic but good,7,27 August 2018,This isn't really my type of movie as there wasn't really any action but it was more focused on a married couple and their relationship but it is well done. I like how the wife having fantasies completely crushes Tom Cruise and causes him to have his weird night out. The film was pretty slow at times but it kind of had to be. Can't lie the nudity didn't hurt in helping me get through it. It wasn't a very sexual movie at all though. It was more with dealing with a long relationship where things get stale I suppose. I liked the end where although he was out trying to get some action all night he clearly saw the faults in what he did and she took him back. She wouldn't say forever though and I liked that touch some reason. The piano was nice for me as well. I'd say 7/10 but one I'd probably never watch again. Too long and I didn't love it.,Eyes Wide Shut
128,harryplinkett14,Disappointing,1,22 August 2018,"When you promise so much to the audience in the first half of the film, and you deliver absolutely nothing, it's a crime. Then again, I hear more than 20 minutes were cut out by the studio, so we will never know what the film was supposed to look like.
But as it is, it's utterly empty. It appears to be deliberately confusing, and not in a way that stimulates people to reflect over what's going on. Is it about genuine Satanic elites and their rituals? Is it more metaphorical? Is it all a dream? Why is it so focused on sex? Frankly, I don't care.
Now, I like the tone of the film, I like its style, and I like the acting. But I am not too impressed with direction. Some of these scenes really could have been directed a lot better. Has Kubrick never watched Hitchcock?
All in all, I enjoyed watching the film. Watching it is a good experience. But when you reach the end, you are just disappointed. And that really pisses me off.",Eyes Wide Shut

When this movie first came out most of the viewing auditions thought to themselves ""What the hell was all that about?"". Even I thought that at the first, until I sawed it again for the second time and got a lot out of it not like the first time viewing it. The cinematography in this movie was so haunting and so clean till the point where I couldn't get my eyes of the screen.

The writing in this film was some of the best writing I've seen in years.The directing in this movie from the masterpiece of film making himself Mr. Kubrick. Every shot and every scene sucked me in with it's chilling and uneasy tone, and Kubrick nailed it once again. Now for the problems: The movie does slow down at times and some scenes could have been cut out ... and that's it really.Eyes Wide Shut is a fantastic peace of work that shouldn't be viewed for only first time, but many times to get the message the movie is trying to get out.",Eyes Wide Shut
130,baileycrawly,Kubrick's Swan Song,9,5 December 2020,"Say what you want about Eyes Wide Shut, the final film from celebrated director Stanley Kubrick, starring Tom Cruise (whose work many are rightfully turned off by as a result of his religious affiliation) and Nicole Kidman as a struggling married couple. One night, the husband goes out and walks into a secret society, where off-colour ritualistic activities occur.
This is a film that made conspiracy theorists run rampant. Some argue that it cost Kubrick his life for trying to expose the ""evils of Hollywood;"" others use it as concrete evidence that an Illuminati not only exists, but thrives. Others love the claim that this isn't the film that Kubrick intended to release, and that was tampered with. Whether or not he personally finished this film is up for debate, but the earlier prints were, in fact, censored to get the rating lowered to an ""R."" Given that Kubrick would tamper with his films up until the very last minute (and sometimes putting out revised editions of the print after public screenings, as infamously occurred with The Shining), it's more than a little likely that this film isn't the same as it would be had Kubrick lived to see the release. But it's pretty close.
This isn't a film for everyone. It's very slow-moving and the tone is very dark and ominous. The uneasy feeling sticks to you like glue, which can easily make audiences feel uncomfortable. There's never a minute of screen time, from the very first scene of Nicole Kidman stripping to the credits where it feels truly safe to let your guard down, and the overwhelming sense of doom and gloom permeates every frame. It's a very slow-moving film that really doesn't do a whole lot in its runtime; it's almost entirely atmospheric. It's a film where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, a film you need to watch on a scene-by-scene basis, but with your eyes on the film as a whole. Unlike his other films, this one has filler material scattered throughout, but it's not so excessive as to feel dominant. It's a film with a purpose, but you need to be willing to sit down, fasten your seatbelt and let it gain momentum in its own way.It's a divisive and lukewarm film in terms of public reception, but I think Kubrick went out on a real high. It's well worth the time investment required to get through it, and it bears rewatching again in the future, as do all of Kubrick's films. This one has the same kind of style, but it applies itself in a way that is completely unlike anything he's ever done, which is why Eyes Wide Shut is yet another entry in the Kubrick masterpiece collection that deserves to be celebrated.",Eyes Wide Shut
131,SKG-2,Kubrick's final masterpiece,10,19 July 1999,"After three years of waiting, EYES WIDE SHUT has finally come out.  So now after all this time, the delays, the rumors, the teases, the sad death of its director, Stanley Kubrick, we finally get to answer the question, Does it live up to the hype?  For the first time this year, the answer to that question is a resounding yes.  This is, so far, the best film I've seen this year, and it deserves its place among other Kubrick masterpieces like DR. STRANGELOVE, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.Although I had been looking forward to this film, I must admit I was unsure about it at first.  After all, since CLOCKWORK, Kubrick's films(BARRY LYNDON, THE SHINING, and FULL METAL JACKET), while having some good parts, have all been somewhat flawed, particularly THE SHINING.  But my misgivings were quickly put to rest within the opening scenes, where we get a glimpse of both what's right on the surface(nine happy years of marriage, wealth, a healthy 7 year old daughter, both husband and wife with jobs) and the possibility of storms that lurk underneath(the practiced way they get ready for the party, hardly looking at each other), and I stayed enthralled throughout.Now I'd like to use this forum to deflect some of the criticisms I've read of the movie so far.  One, of course, is that this is not really New York City, but a soundstage in England.  I've lived in New York City and visited several times, and the surface details seem right, but more importantly, this is set in the ""rich"" area of Manhattan, which has always been idealized in movies(particularly the Woody Allen ones), and thus it's appropriate in a dream-like movie to play to the fantasy of the city, rather than the reality.Secondly, we are given no hint that this is a dream Cruise's character may be walking in, since it looks so real(yes, that's inconsistent with the criticism up above, but to be fair, I've only seen a couple of reviews which make that mistake).  First of all, dreams rarely look like they were designed by Salvador Dali(at least, my dreams).  Secondly, if the whole nighttime sequence looked like a dream and nothing else, we would laugh when Cruise goes back to the various places he visited at night; how would he know to go back to them if they weren't real?  Finally, in the way the narrative unspools, it's played like a dream, complete with scene where he might be awakening(the scene with Domino(Vinessa Shaw), the prostitute, where his cell phone rings and Kidman is on the phone right before he can do any damage).Thirdly, that Kidman is only in the film for 40 minutes of its 2 hour, 40 minute running length.  Now granted, that is all of her screen time, but when Cruise enters his ""dream state"", she is always in back of his mind, not just in the flashback scenes(when he imagines her having sex with the sailor she had fantasies about), but in the fact that all the other women he comes across are meant to make him think of Kidman.  And her performance is certainly strong enough(especially in her monologues) to linger in the mind.Fourth, that Cruise is completely flat here.  Again, at least in the dreams I've had and read about, often in dreams we react to events, not provoke them, and that's what his character does.  Secondly, Kubrick and Cruise play off of his image, to make him the object of desire of everyone he meets, and not just women(I like to think the scenes where he's harassed by a group of teenage thugs who think he's gay, and where hotel concierge Alan Cumming seems to be coming on to him, are Kubrick's way of joking about the rumors of Cruise being gay which have dogged him).  For all of that, I think he plays it exactly right.Finally, that the film is flat and not really sexy.  Once again, unless it's a nightmare, dreams aren't played at MTV speed.  Secondly, contrary to what we heard at first about the film, this isn't about sex.  Rather, this is about sexual obsession, so it's not supposed to be about sex the act.  It may seem like the film cheats a little by asking us to play off our expectations of Cruise and Kidman as a couple, so we just picture in our heads them having sex, rather than us seeing it, but isn't it good that some things are left to our imagination?  Besides, it's only on the surface that things look good, as I said before.Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to read DREAM STORY, the novella this is based on, and so have no answer to those who claim this is a poor adaptation(though what some have called stilted dialogue I think adds to the dreamlike quality, and I'm normally on the lookout for flat dialogue), and that may be true.  But this is an excellent film, a fitting epitaph for Kubrick, and proof once again that Cruise can act when he's teamed with a real director.",Eyes Wide Shut
132,chrisbrown6453,Um...hmm...Ok...,6,21 May 2002,"I'll tell you what. For everything that takes place in Eyes Wide Shut, to me it just boils down to one man dealing with the thought of his wife being with someone else.

It starts with a visit to an old friend, goes to a prostitute, follows into a bar, goes to a costume shop, and ends up at one of the weirdest orgies I've ever seen. Then again, I've never been to one so who am I to say it's wierd. There is a lot of nudity, and a lot of talking in this movie. It's very slow moving. The characters seem to have to draw everything out by repeating things over and over. If someone asks a question, the answer has to include that same question. A few times I wanted to yell, ""Just spit it out already!"". The story was just plain odd. Bill, after finding out about his wife's fantasy, ends up walking around New York. Everywhere he goes he is tempted by a beautiful woman. Whether it's a prostitute, a friend, a man pimping his daughter, or a woman in a mask, someone always seems to want him. And the question is, will he give in to his temptation and, in his mind, get back at his wife? Or will he not allow himself to cross that line?
The performances were pretty good overall. Tom Cruise again shows why he is so successful as an actor, and not just another pretty face. He gives more of a subtle, laid back performance this time. His facial expressions and emotions don't go very far, but that's the sort of tone the entire movie has. Nicole Kidman, who wasn't in the movie nearly as much as I thought she would be, also gives a fine performance. I saw her character as being very sexual, someone every man would want, which is why Tom Cruise's character deals with so much after hearing about her fantasy. Sydney Pollack is the only other person in the film who showed up for more than a few scenes. Everyone else had their part and then left. Leelee Sobieski was the only other person I really recognized, and she had a very small, yet revealing part. Being that this is Stanley Kubrick's last film, I suppose I should say something about the filmmaking. I've only seen two other Kubrick films in their entirety, and those were 2001 and A Clockwork Orange. I've also seen parts of The Shining, and the one thing they've all had in common, is that they are very deliberate. Kubrick takes a lot of time to get the audience to see everything that goes on around the characters. Every shot, every sentence is milked as much as it can. While it tends to make the films longer than most other directors would make it, it also makes it very full. I'm not sure how else to say it. You never feel like something is missing from a scene. From the set design to the music, every scene is full of life. Especially in this film. From the apartment sets to the orgy, the look of the movie was very distinct. And the music, especially that haunting piano, kept me on the edge of my seat. Overall, Eyes Wide Shut is definitely not for everyone. To many it will seem extremely boring, and the ending not very spectacular. To others it will be considered a masterpiece. To me, it fell somewhere in the middle. Not the greatest film ever made, not even the best Kubrick film ever made, but something that will definitely go down in history. And if that's not reason enough to go see it, I don't know what else is.",Eyes Wide Shut
133,bat-5,A tale of jealousy,7,16 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut examines what happens to a couple when one little truth is revealed.  Nicole Kidman tells husband Tom Cruise that she would've dropped everything in her life for one night with a Naval officer.  This sends Cruise into a state of unbalanced jealousy.  He imagines his wife with the officer, doing things.  Those thoughts send him wandering the streets of New York.  He runs into a friend of his and learns of a secret club.  From there, things get stranger for Tom.  Kubrick's last film features his usual exquisite camera work.  The centerpiece of the film reminded me of a cross between, The Overlook from The Shining and HAL's disembodided voice whenever one of the masked guests spoke.  The main theme of the film is jealousy, and what it can do to one's emotional state.   A haunting vision that will take time to grow on us.",Eyes Wide Shut
134,rdoyle29,Kubrick's slightest film,6,26 May 2012,"On repeat viewing, this is my least favourite Kubrick film. I do not think his leads are up to the task. Cruise is simply okay, as he often is, but Kidman is really quite terrible. Kubrick has a tendency to let his characters overact which can work out well (George C. Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove"") or not so well (Patrick Magee in ""A Clockwork Orange). In Kidman's case, it's quite disastrous. 2 1/2 hours is far too long for such a slight story, and it seems to have been stretched out by slowing the dialogue to a deathly pace in most scenes. While the plot largely follows Schnitzler's novel, he has replaced the novel's conclusion with a puzzlingly arbitrary resolution that seems completely detached from the plot that precedes it.",Eyes Wide Shut

Despite all the pre-release hype about the cutting edge sex supposedly being ingrained in this film, the end product is a film about NOT having sex. It is about a guy going out to have a quickie affair and despite getting propositioned by women, a teenage girl, a gay man and two prostitutes, not to mention attending an orgy, the guy never even gets his pants unzipped. It is like Blake Edwards' ""10"" without the laughs. Worse its soft core porn with no sex, a thriller with no suspense, and a drama with no depth or insight. It is a shaggy dog story, all build up with no pay off. It's like the orgy scene that is the film's center piece; everyone prances around in costumes and masks and never get around to doing anything, sexual or otherwise. (Was Kubrick so isolated from years of being locked away plotting movie scripts that he was totally out of touch with the real world and the sexual revolution? His prissy view of sexuality is like something that might have been shocking in the early sixties, but now seems embarrassingly infantile.) <BR> I will confess that I am not a great fan of Kubrick. True, as a visual stylist, he is quite accomplished, but it takes more than pretty pictures to make a great film. A heart and soul or at least a hint of passion are needed. I write this after having seen A.I., a truly great film. It has Kubrick's striking visual sense, but Spielberg gave it what has been missing from Kubrick's work since before 2001, and that is humanity.",Eyes Wide Shut

It is about NOT having sex. Like Dudley Moore before him, Tom Cruise sets out to have an affair and, despite encountering a variety of eager women (and one man), can't seem to even get his pants unzipped. The result is a comedy of errors with no laughs; a porn film with no sex and a thriller with no suspense. Kubrick seems to have been hopelessly stuck in the early sixties as far has his view of eroticism is concerned. From Alan Cummings oh-so limp wristed homosexual to the orgy where everyone prances around in maskes and costumes, Kubrick seems to have thought he would shock the audience with something new and daring. But time passed Stanley by -- even soft-core porn offers more explicit material then presented here and daytime soaps have more insightful examinations of infidelity and maritial angst. This film is stylishly, but utterly gutless in addressing the issues it pretends to be exploring. And don't get me started on the truly awful musical score....",Eyes Wide Shut
137,rajatdahiyax,One of the greatest unfinished movies!!!!!!!!,8,27 September 2014,"Eyes Wide Shut is a 1999 American erotic thriller film loosely based upon Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella Dream Story. The film was directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick. It was his last film, as he died six days after showing his final cut to Warner Brothers studios.[2] The story, set in and around New York City, follows the sexually charged adventures of Dr. Bill Harford, who is shocked when his wife, Alice, reveals that she had contemplated an affair a year earlier. He embarks on a night-long adventure, during which he infiltrates a massive masked orgy of an unnamed secret society.Kubrick obtained the filming rights for Dream Story in the 1960s, considering it a perfect novel to adapt on a film about sexual relations. The project was only revived in the 1990s, when the director hired writer Frederic Raphael to help him with the adaptation. The film was mostly shot in the United Kingdom (aside from some exterior establishing shots), and included a detailed recreation of some exterior Greenwich Village street scenes at Pinewood Studios. The film spent a long time in production, and holds the Guinness World Record for the longest continuous film shoot period, at 400 days.",Eyes Wide Shut

No. So much happens in this film that you just don't care about, and Kidman squeaks and screetches her way through the script so much that you just wish her off screen all the time while Cruise seems to be trying to deliver his most restrained performance of all time. Sure, it's an engaging story, but none of the outcomes or discoveries really excite you or interest you. Indeed at the final outcome, the hinge of the entire story, I just wanted them to shut up and get off the screen. Not a good sign, and not a good film.",Eyes Wide Shut
139,michaelarmer,9 Year Itch,6,16 December 2019,"I looked at the reviews on here before watching this and oh my, how wrong most people are.Some are dismissing it as rubbish and others are pretending they are not looking at it as a sex film and pretend they know about its psychology and art, they looking too deeply into it and rating it higher than it deserves when really they are just getting off on the naked women in it. And what they say about it is mostly fantasy (not the sexual fantasy in the movie) but a fantasy that is in their own minds.This film is not about sexual fantasy's at all, it is a porno dressed up as a drama come thriller, about a married couple coming to a point in their relationship where its got a bit stale and it needed something like this to sort themselves out, a bit like a 7 year itch (in this case they are married for 9 years), the problem was that they were too truthful with each other. She had a sex fantasy after being ""hit on"" at a party and when she told him he decided to try a bit himself, there's nothing dark or mysterious about it, with some people it happens. But they have added a lot of nakedness to spice it up a bit.The movie started out as a drama, and turned into a kind of thriller, after Cruise stumbled upon an orgy involving high up people who did not want it to be found out, but nothing too serious, they just wanted to (and succeeded) scare him off.The acting from Cruise and Kidman was very good, the cameo by the noted Director Sydney Pollak was also good, the few supporting actors were ok, you did not see a lot of them because many had masks on. Direction was average, Stanley Kubrick was on his last film, and although he has made some good films, he has also made some poor ones, this is about middle for him. The music was a bit dreary though and it moved too slow, some of the dialogue was very slow, not like real, it was trying to be over dramatic. It is 2hr 40 mins in length and was too long, it was a bit boring most of the time, they could have shortened it without losing much and it would have been better, or they could have put more in, made the thriller part a bit more thrilling with more intrigue and a bit of action, just a bit and it would have been ok for the length.Personally I believe many of the High rated reviews are because they are repressed sex pests and were just excited to see a few sexy female bodies, and did not see much else, because they were inaccurate about some of the details. Maybe its why they made it like that to attract the perverts? Another thing I noticed was that you hardly saw any naked men (blurred in distance) and all the women on this film are tall, blonde and leggy, and almost all are stripping off with good views of their bums, is this a Stanley Kubrick fetish ? Did he make this film just so he could masturbate over his favourite type of woman ? Was he a Harvey Weinstein type ?I gave it a 6 for the intrigue and good acting, if a bit shorter or more exciting, or not for the porn angle it would have been higher.I am pretty sure that the perverts who pretend it is stylistic will diss me for my comments, it's because they don't like it when someone points out the obvious.",Eyes Wide Shut
140,chuck-reilly,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is disappointing final film for Kubrick",6,8 November 2013,"Stanley Kubrick made some great movies in his day---but this is not one of them. Simply put, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" meanders all over the place and the director himself never seems to know exactly what kind of film he's making. Is it a murder mystery? Is it an exploitative shocker? Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the two totally baffled leads in this clunker, never really grasp any tangible idea that's being presented and act like they don't know if they're coming or going. Kubrick, being the iron-fisted controlling director that he was, completely stifles the couple and it shows. Both of them give the appearance that they'd rather be anywhere else but on the set. Ms. Kidman is only on-screen about half the time compared to her soon-to-be ex-husband Cruise. She's the lucky one. Cruise's character (a Manhattan doctor) is vapid, indecisive, confused and disillusioned---and that's just from him reading Kubrick's script. Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh were enlightened enough to have jumped out of appearing in this movie before the first morning rushes. Instead, Sydney Pollack does his best with the weak writing and nonsensical story as does poor Leelee Sobieski. As for the movie itself, the sex scenes fall flat as a pancake, the plot is irrelevant, and the actors look like they all want to hang themselves. Luckily for the public-at-large, only a few of them went to see this bomb. It's a shame because Kubrick was one of the great directors of his day. At least one can always rent ""Lolita,"" or ""Dr. Strangelove,"" or ""Paths of Glory,"" etc. All of those films are far superior in every way than this woeful concoction. The only thing you can ask yourself if you happen to sit through this abomination is ""What was Stanley thinking?"" There is no answer. According to many sources, Kubrick himself was very disappointed that this movie was a dud and that he wasted fifteen months of his life making it. He wasn't the only one. The studio wasn't happy either. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was also a box-office failure.",Eyes Wide Shut

There are better ways to point something out with music in a film. As it is, it just gets on my nerves (and maybe that's Kubrick's idea, too).Overall, this film was probably over-hyped, but I don't think Kubrick could have left us in a better way.",Eyes Wide Shut
142,Mort-31,Being in old Stanley's brain,6,6 April 2001,"Arthur Schnitzler's Traumnovelle` was the model Kubrick based his film upon, and after all those almost perverse details that were heard before Eye Wide Shut` was released, it's amazing how slavishly it sticks to that model. For me, this means nothing good because I was as unsuccessful in finding out what Schnitzler wanted to say as I was with Kubrick. Schnitzler had at least a fine, readable language, which of course gets lost in an English language film.I saw the film shortly after it was released here, but I remembered it when I saw The Cell` recently. The two movies belong to dissimilar genres and try to meet completely different requirements, but the intensity of their pictures and how they prefer them to everything else, even the story. The director of The Cell` justified himself by a reference to the genre he comes from (videoclips), Stanley Kubrick, being dead, couldn't justify himself any more, and I can't imagine what he would have said, if he was still alive. After his masterpieces Full Metal Jacket`, The Shining` and several others, Eyes Wide Shut` seems like the late work of an unenthusiastic old artist, lacking ideas, full of emotionalism and overwhealming pictures, obsessed with sex, visually and in the dialogues. Also the characters (Tom Cruise giving one of his weak performances and Nicole Kidman who is not more than a supporting actress here) seem to think about nothing else. Being in old Stanley Kubrick's brain.How badly will he rate this movie, some of you might ask. And here is the surprise: Speaking purely emotionally, remembering the feeling I had during watching the film and immediately afterwards, I must admit that the film was a) not boring and b) absolutely fascinating, and two years later I can't, I just can't tell why. Obviously, there was still something, something not tangible left of Kubrick's genius. However, it's a pity that he's not among us. 6 points out of",Eyes Wide Shut

Look at them. They are not there without a reason. And each one has a particular meaning. And pay attention to the infamous orgy scene, which some may found it to be too distracting, to look at the paintings as well. References to the Roman empire are clever, if you look right on it.

That aspect of his work never changed throughout the decades and there's no reason to believe that Kubrick would change to conventional film making so late in life.  Kubrick would also stick to his re-occurring theme of dehumanization for his final film.Carrying this film for the better part of the way the same as he did in 'Born on the Fourth of July' is Tom Cruise.  Forget his marketable name, forget his early juvenile films and give this man the credit he deserves. Cruise exhibits sexual frustration and a wrestling match with his conscience superbly in this film as a man with an unwavering amount of decency in the perverse world he discovers.  It's a challenge any actor would have difficulty with and Cruise holds his own with any other actor that could have played this role.  Two Oscar nominations and his ability to act equally as well opposite Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson and Paul Newman (who heaped well deserved praise on Cruise), make Cruise that rare commodity of actor AND movie star and those who don't see his talent can only hope to in the future.",Eyes Wide Shut
148,Hermit C-2,The disappointment of a lifetime.,2,20 August 1999,"I don't think I ever anticipated a film so much in my life, seeing as how I think Kubrick is the greatest of all directors and it had been twelve long years since his last feature. Imagine my surprise--make that shock--after two-and-a-half hours in a dark theatre, stunned to find out that 'Eyes Wide Shut' was not only a disappointment, but a total failure as a film.What's more, the depth and breadth of this fiasco is amazing. Virtually none of the elements that made Kubrick's films such a joy to watch in the past are present here. In his greatest films, almost every shot gave the viewer something glorious, or at least interesting, to watch. There's none of that in this film. Kubrick's use of music in his other movies has always been smart, and sometimes even revolutionary. Here it's just one more mediocre element in an at best mundane production, epitomized by the single, hammered piano note that is so ineffectively used in scenes to supposedly denote tension. The slow, deliberate pace of his movies that had served him so well before just invites boredom here.The most offending elements, though, are the story and script.  Perhaps Arthur Schnitzler's story 'Traumnovelle' said something relevant to its audience earlier in the century; I don't know, I haven't read it. But this adaptation doesn't have much relevance at all to an audience at the end of that century. What's worse is the script, co-written by the great man himself. The dialog here is so trite and mediocre at times that I believe most first-year film students would have rejected it as just too hackneyed. (""You must leave at once! You are in great danger!"" Did I really hear that?)Trouble signs appeared to me early on. After the party scene where a suddenly inebriated Nicloe Kidman inexplicably almost falls for some man about 30 years older than her using hoary pick-up lines, she and husband Tom Cruise go home and have a conversation/argument about jealousy, desire and fidelity. She tells him dramatically about how she almost threw away her marriage and family just to satisfy a momentary lust. By the time these two scenes are over we've been listening to Kidman drawl out her lines for about 45 minutes and I came to the awful realization that this confessional was supposed to be the impetus for the rest of the action. This scene also contains an embarrassingly phony laughing fit by Kidman. I would accuse her of bad acting, but given the knowledge of the way Kubrick worked, this must be the way he wanted the scene to go.Driven by a jealous vision of his wife making love to another man, Cruise sets out on an ""odyssey"" that takes him all over New York for a series of meaningless encounters with various characters in which virtually nothing happens. If there was a point to all this empty activity, that would have been one thing, but this story is too weak to support any kind of a moral. A reference to HIV which comes late in the movie is jarring, because it has some relation to the real world which, up to that point, had been almost totally lacking. Of course, there was no danger of anyone contracting it, since there is little sex or passion in this film about sexual obsession. Even the notorious ""orgy"" scene (for lack of a better word) will not raise an eyebrow of most viewers in 1999, a sign that Kubrick was out of touch with his audience and their level of sophistication after being isolated for so many years. In his defense, it may be that the scene would have been more effective if it had been shown the way he originally shot it.So what happened? Well, as just noted, perhaps Kubrick had simply been away from filmmaking too long and his instincts weren't sharp anymore. Also it's doubtful that anyone would suggest to this acknowledged genius that something just wasn't working this time around. Whatever the reason I found this a sad ending to a brilliant career, but one that won't tarnish the overall legacy of the man. It's often been said that if Kubrick had only directed '2001: A Space Odyssey,' he'd still be remembered as a genius. Now I believe it can be said that Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaking genius even though he directed 'Eyes Wide Shut.'",Eyes Wide Shut

Kudos to Cruise for publicly sticking up for the artist's finished result. The only compromise was a digitally added cloaked figure in front of an act of copulation.As with the master's prior great works, what matters is not so much the plot or content but the -way- in which he conceives things purely for film. The hallmarks of this are the rearwards camera view that lead the actors through space, the dreamy long takes and reverse-angle cuts with generous lead time between bits of dialogue.With this film we get the tantalizing promise of a narrative game - is this a dream? Whose dream is it, actually? Or overlapping dreams with no 'real world' to bring us back to? Note the use of one redhead (Kidman) to drive us into one dream state, and the opposing talisman (Davis, also a redhead) to drive us out again.

Kubrick takes the viewer down a haunting journey in every film he produces especially so in his final film ""Eyes Wide Shut"". The long length and creepy musical score of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" along with many other Kubrick films keep viewers in suspense, those Kubrick methods keep viewers in haunting drama  throughout his movies, but that is only an element of intrigue that Kubrick uses in his plots leading up to surprises and hidden secrets to be discovered. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" has Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star as an affluent couple in crisis. Cruise a Manhattan doctor begins to embark on a bizarre odyssey of sexual discovery after his wife (Kidman) admits to an unfulfilled romantic fantasy involving an attractive stranger. Cruise discovers a strange and underworld sex subculture through the streets of New York City. To his shock and amazement he finds that even close friends that he thought he knew well happen to be apart of this strange sex subculture. Cruise then tells his wife (Kidman) about his bizarre odyssey then in the films ending the couple both once again discover there sexual feelings. Though Kubrick's long drawn out pace and haunting score are complicated to many he sends some very clear messages with his final work ""Eyes Wide Shut"" one when beginning with a crisis individuals must go through a journey of discovery. Second a journey can lead to a unknown subculture that test sanity. Third through a journey discovery is found as in this films case it's sexual and morality leading Cruise back to Kidman no matter how bad or insecure the situation anyone can learn to enjoy what they have. What one person learns through a journey of discovery the other can be eager to take part in related things, as evidenced by Nicole Kidman's last words in the movie after Tom ended his odyssey watch and you will understand. A masterpiece and a tribute to Stanley Kubrick it's nice his final film was so great he always wanted a film to be a search and discovery to the viewer no matter how complicated. You male viewers get a treat you get a couple scenes of Nicole Kidman nude, but this film has so much more it's a meaning of discovery. It took me two viewings to fully understand the meaning that's why I feel anyone should watch ""Eyes Wide Shut"" it educates a viewer to explore and think.",Eyes Wide Shut
151,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,The last Masterpiece!,7,24 June 2008,"It was inevitable that Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut would be the most misunderstood film of 1999. Kubrick died four months prior to its release, and there was no end to speculation how much he would have tinkered with the picture, changed it, ""fixed"" it. We'll never know. But even without the haunting enigma of the director's death--and its eerie echo/anticipation in the scene when Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) visits the deathbed of one of his patients--Eyes Wide Shut would have perplexed and polarized viewers and reviewers. After all, virtually every movie of Kubrick's post-U.S. career had; only 1964's Dr. Strangelove opened to something approaching consensus. Quite apart from the author's tinkering, Kubrick's movies themselves always seemed to change--partly because they changed us, changed the world and the ways we experienced and understood it. And we may expect Eyes Wide Shut to do the same. Unlike Kubrick himself, it has time. So consider, as we settle in to live with this long, advisedly slow, mesmerizing film, how challenging and ambiguous its narrative strategy is. The source is an Arthur Schnitzler novella titled Traumnovelle (or ""Dream Story""), and it's a moot question how much of Eyes Wide Shut itself is dream, from the blue shadows frosting the Harfords' bedroom to the backstage replica of New York's Greenwich Village that Kubrick built in England. Its major movement is an imaginative night-journey (even the daylight parts of it) taken by a man reeling from his wife's teasing confession of fantasized infidelity, and toward the end there is a token gesture of the couple waking to reality and, perhaps, a new, chastened maturity. Yet on some level--visually, psychologically, logically--every scene shimmers with unreality. Is everything in the movie a dream? And if so, who is dreaming it at any given moment, and why?Don't settle for easy answers. Kubrick's ultimate odyssey beckons. And now the dream is yours.",Eyes Wide Shut

153,ragingbull_2005,So freaking good!!!,8,22 October 2012,"From the first scene itself when the camera moves seductively over the naked body of Nicole Kidman, you know you are in throes of a legendary director. Kubrick, who passed away one week after completing the edit on this movie, makes one of his best flicks here. Based on a 1926 book called Dream Story, this tells about a doctor, played quite well by Tom Cruise, who goes on a night of sexual discovery after learning that his wife, played by Kidman who was his real wife at that time, almost cheated on him once. He meets a motley of characters and his interactions with them are written and directed superbly by Kubrick. There is the unforgettable scene in the castle which will send shivers down the spine. In the acting department, Kidman easily bests Cruise even though she has a much smaller role. The background score is superb. There are scenes which depict orgies and they understandably are explicit. The scenes are set up and executed so beautifully. Kubrick was in a class of his own. This is his final movie and the touch never waned. 4 out of 5 for this masterpiece. It is nearly 155 minutes long but did not drag even once and that is the hallmark of a great director.",Eyes Wide Shut
154,barberoux,Worth discussing.,8,8 August 2001,"I've just watched Eyes Wide Shut for the third time.  I think the movie has great depth and can invoke good discussions of its meaning.  The performances of the actors are generally good except for the two principles. I found Cruise wooden and Kidman overemoting but both were passable.  It's just that they were surrounded by a talented cast.  What was the movie about?  (SPOILERS lurk ahead).  I think the movie is a metaphor of marriage. Cruise's sexual ego becomes damaged after Kidman confesses to sexual fantasies, about another man.  He encounters sexual situations that further shake his already damaged psyche.  He then discovers his alter ego,what he might want to be if freed from his conventions, in the form of Nightengale and obtains the password to a place that promises forbidden pleasures.  The apparent orgy he then attends is, in fact, the metaphor for marriage.  The women are anointed, or blessed, by the high priest, then they reveal their sexuality.  They choose a man and go off to enjoy all kinds of sexual pleasure.  Cruise the intruder is unmasked and told to leave and not to mention what goes on within the mansion.  The sexual pleasure is only to be enjoyed within the mansion, or within the confines of marriage.  Outside of the mansion, or marriage, sexual pleasure brings about dire circumstances. A hooker dies of a overdose and Cruise visits another, (naively bearing pastries for the prostitute), and is warned off by the possibility of death from disease, the HIV.  He is further warned to stop his enquires, into infidelity, when he shows up at the mansion again. (How does he get into the mansion? By, falsely, promising fidelity.)  He goes home and finds the mask on his pillow.  Was this an invitation to enjoy sex within the bounds of marriage with his wife?  I've wondered about the ending sequence, and the last word, and its meaning and I think it shows sexual freedom is allowed within the marriage.  Maybe my interpretation is a stretch but the movie allows for that stretch and that is why is so good.",Eyes Wide Shut
155,Silverzero,"Empty, dull and painstakingly boring. A wasted opportunity for all concerned.",7,11 April 2003,"The plot line sounded very good for this film. A dreamy, erotic oddessy through Manhattan's seedy underworld. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are the main stars. The film's atmospheric and moody teaser trailers made `Eyes Wide Shut' look a lot better than it actually was. The real result is subtle, boring drivel that only amounts to being a pathetic excuse for cheap pornography. I've never been a fan of Stanley Kubrick's movies and his last piece of completed work hasn't impressed me. There is no creativity in `Eyes Wide Shut', and nothing stands out among the evident dross. Yet people still call this man a genius; the mind boggles. Perhaps the film would have been much better had it been someone else, maybe Martin Scorsese. He's created a hellish yet vivid portrayal of New York in the past and I think he would have done a much better job. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's last pairing is indeed they're worst. The main problem is that any less popular actors could have easily replaced them. The chemistry between the two is convincing and ultimately believable, but they know that they could do with better material than this.
The pedestrian pace that the film takes and the slow, dull narrative fail to help it either. At 162 minutes, the plot and much-to-subtle dialogue are insufficient for it's length. Sure, Nicole Kidman looks good in her birthday suit, but there's little else good to remember about it. When it tries to be inventive it just ends up being plain weird. Very little can compensate for the misery and despair that it digs itself into. While it is an oddly interesting movie experience it's not one that you will have good memories of. Fans of Kubrick's earlier work might respect it, but most normal people will find this as repulsive as the south end of a magnet. For me `Eyes Wide Shut' is an overlong and hopeless misfire. 4.6/10.",Eyes Wide Shut

159,jgcorrea,"A delightfully weird, poignant piece of satire on twisted morals",10,24 October 2019,"Critical disappointment with Eyes Wide Shut was unanimous, and the complaint was always the same: it isn't not sexy, it debases human relations. Reviewers sounded like gymnasium practitioners who had gotten out of the theater three hours later feeling horny, frustrated, and fooled: Kubrick was old, out of key with his time. The movie's sexual mores and taboos, extracted straightly from Arthur Schnitzler's fin-de-siecle Viennese Dream Play - jealousy over fantasies played out, guilt-ridden visits to prostitutes, tense discussions of HIV tests that echoed the old terror of syphilis - seemed apparently timid and naif by 1999 standards .
By 2019 , however, the ongoing backlash against the film is blamed on its cynical, miscalculated ad campaign.
Really? The movie's title told us that we were not to really see what we were staring at. In other words, Eyes Wide Shut was neither about sex nor porn. Its real obscenity was in the depiction of the shameless wealth of playful Manhattan, and its effect on society and the human soul. In fact, Kubrick once said he wanted to make a film about doctors because ""everyone hates doctors."" The Harfords do not, like typical Hollywood villains, speak with a foreign accent: they are ""nice"" people - attractive and well-educated, - a couple who collect art and listen to erudite music. The author's point was, evil among the elite is often a question of ignorance, passivity & blindness rather than of cruel alienation. Stanley Kubrick only emphasized - once again in his unique oeuvre - that culture and erudition may have little to do with goodness or depth of character.",Eyes Wide Shut
160,thenolanfan,Review - Eyes Wide Shut,6,12 August 2020,"Kubrick never lost his talent for directing, but he certainly missed the key that alimented is precedent daring and ambiguous stories. In a certain way, this film surfed on the cult status of 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, and A Clock Work Orange.This film is faithful to Kubrick's previous ones in terms of color palette, it is always enjoyable to see how many different emotions he can transpose to screen with red. However, all those gimmicks in the production design are for fans of Kubrick clues to the resolution of the story.The so call ""odyssey"" of Bill felt long and extremely redundant in ideas exactly like the predictable and cheesy dialogue.But really, Eyes Wide Shut is too explanatory. If you pay a little attention you can easily notice that Kubrick is giving away every bit of substances, and you realize that after all, it is just bones wrapped in aesthetic eroticism.",Eyes Wide Shut

The script is as usual a little bid odd, there are at least a couple of controversial scenes, it's long, and the ending is perfectly surprisingly.                              The set and score are notable. The acting is great, and different when you know that Cruise and Kidman really are married. Also a number of different side-figures.

Deeply troubled and unable to shake off this new found thorn in the relationship he finds himself in a twist of fate that sends him into a downward spiral where he ends up with more than he bargained for. Perhaps Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" showcases the legendary director's trademarks. The symbolism, the distinguished acting, flawless cinematography and the steady, gradual pacing that leads to the climax. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are well cast as the troubled and attractive couple who go through the challenges of marriage as their world is shaken to its core by matters beyond their control. But the most compelling and haunting factor of the film is the mystery that lies behind the circumstances of the events and what may have transpired. Secret societies, the Illuminati, sinister and deviant rituals, the elite and the other conspiracy theories that have made this film one of the most discussed and dissected works in cinema history. While somewhat slow-going made more by one too many unnecessary scenes, this final bow by Kubrick is a testament to the power of cinema to entertain and to make one think on the reality of the world one lives in while searching for the truth to find meaning and purpose in our lives.",Eyes Wide Shut
164,galileo3,"Kubrick's haunting, psychosexual masterpiece",10,5 November 2007,"EYES WIDE SHUT (1999)Number 1 - 1999 Top 10 - 1990s Top 100 - All TimeStanley Kubrick's ultimate film is many things. A compelling psychosexual journey, a haunting, surrealistic experience and a fascinatingly chilling study of the darker aspects of humanity.This is a satisfying conclusion to the career of one of the greatest figures in the history of cinema. Eyes Wide Shut is no ordinary film. It is a stunning, spectrum of dreams and opportunities avoided. This is what Kubrick should be remembered for; daring, outrageous film-making, graphic, unbelievable scenes, moments, words... The anticipation to this film had been groundbreaking. CRUISE.KIDMAN.KUBRICK. was the tagline... Critics were ready to praise or scrutinise the great director's work, and they did. Eyes Wide Shut, like most of Kubrick's films (including 2001, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket) was met with mixed reviews. Some critics were ecstatic, awarding the film a five star rating, while others were severely critical. This is an important thing for Kubrick films; they are strange, personal, mystical, ambiguous pictures that may provoke or bore - this is what makes Stanley Kubrick the great filmmaker that he was and shall ever be. Classifying 'Eyes Wide Shut' as an erotic thriller does not do it justice. This is an intense, visceral study of humanity, the bonds that bring us together and the lusts that disintegrate us as a society. I refuse to believe that Stanley Kubrick spent his time making a film just to display graphic sexuality and nudity. This film is about so much more. Kubrick studies how the various functions and derivatives in our society cause us to become depersonalised, dehumanised and become mere primitive animals enganging in crude acts. The famous orgy scene, which was subjected to ludicruous digital altering for the American cinemas is something splendidly unusual. It is a vivid, visual orgy, a mad orchestration of colours, lighting, costumes and music, a sequence that remarkably reminds of the kind of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick is. As Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise), wonders through the halls, passing near masked men and women that engage in sexual acts - here sex is nothing more than a sinful, pleasurous activity. The human element of love and passion in sexual intercourse is completely stripped in this stunning, intoxicating sequence. There are probably important people behind that mask, hiding behind a layer of plastic that is covering their identity, and if revealed, it would be disastrous... Kubrick plays special attention to each scene; he doesn't roll them together, he pauses, like each scene is like a dream or rather a nightmare. The perfectionist that is Kubrick is apparent in every camera angle in this film. Perhaps Kubrick wants to tell us that everything is so easy to access for the affluent. Sex, drugs, fantasies, yet nothing seems enough at the end. The film is two and a half hours long, it's structured beautifully and with passion across every scene, and of course there's no denying that this is strictly an adult film that collides with elements of psychological thriller, intense drama and perhaps at times surrealistic horror. This is no small feat. Kubrick departed the pantheon of cinema in glorious fashion, with his last intoxicating masterpiece. Ironically, the last word ever uttered on a Stanley Kubrick film is F*CK...10/10",Eyes Wide Shut

167,jamesjustice-92,Kubrick knows how to keep you on the edge of the seat,7,14 November 2020,"And he does that painfully slow.
I wouldn't call Eyes Wide Shut Stanley's best work or even close to one of those for that matter; he truly was a remarkable person and has done many genres throughout his career - from a war drama to a history epic to black comedy to sci-fi to psychological thriller, you name it - he had done it all. But not always with success or much sense if you ask me. This one is just the case of it.
Don't misunderstand me, I love Kubrick and his style but it seems like he has taken everything I hated about his movies and doubled it for this one: unnerving soundtrack, slow narrative with even slower dialogue delivery, weak and superficial screenplay which basically tells a story of a couple having marital problems through the prism of sexual innuendos, unnecessary exposition and characters and too much nudity - don't get me wrong, I don't mind nakedness but the movie concentrated way too much time on it, and to top it all off I have to sneak in Nicole Kidman's attempts at acting here as well - nothing about her character really stands out and she is basically there to move the already slow narrative but is not very good at it either.
But after all this is not a bad movie; it makes you look at your own relationship, see yourself in a character and weigh in on your decisions and their consequences, sympathize with him (but not too much), enjoy the good camerawork and Tom Cruise's fine acting and just burn this movie after watching but, as this is a Stanley Kubrick's movie we're talking about, you will never be able to do so.",Eyes Wide Shut

The film follows Bill and Alice Harford who seem like a typical New York wealthy and happy family with their 7 year old daughter but when Alice reveals a secret about a sexual encounter with a man from last summer, Bill then goes to get fair on his wife by also sleeping with someone and after everything fails, Bill then is recommended by his friend to go to a building outside NYC only to discover the great danger he's in and how it can affect his family and friends. Eyes Wide Shut deserves more attention because it truly is a masterpiece in cinematic history, why? The film is art, it's so beautiful, can we all just look at that amazing ritual scene in the film, that scene was basically a painting, literally, A PAINTING!! The performances are so loveable but I haft to say, Kidman goes way over Cruise, I really wished she was in the film more which was probably just my little glitch with it but I truly did not mind that, she was just better than Tom Cruise, no affence! There arent really any other characters except for a few who pop in and out like the costume shop man and his daughter and people like that.

His practice is successful and he and his wife get invited to a party in which they go their separate ways. Kindman does a great job as the doctor's wife who is also having sexual thoughts of her own. I must say it kept my interest though you will have to wait a while for things to develop and go somewhere. The bottom line is that this is a toss up.

172,Brogan,A brilliant farewell from a brilliant director.,10,18 July 1999,"Let me start by saying that last March, I was deeply saddened by the death of Stanley Kubrick.  I never met the man, but with reading his biographies and watching his movies countless times, I can understand what the man is trying to say through his films.  I was upset that we will never see the much awaited Kubrick film titled ""A.I."" (ARTIFICIAL INTELLENGENCE), but I am pleased that we will see one more film of Kubrick's titled ""EYES WIDE SHUT."" For months, even before Kubrick's death, I was highly eager for this film.  One of the best director's of all time first film in twelve years (since 1987 FULL METAL JACKET).  And it came no surprise that the film kept getting delayed, (from December of 1998, to March 1999, and finally July 16, 1999).  But I knew Kubrick would do that. One of his most famous tales is that the MGM executives were upset at Kubrick for delaying ""2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.""  One of the MGM exceutives asked Kubrick, ""is that the title of the movie, or when it's coming out?"" But the time has come, July 16th has finally arrived.  Before I saw a exclusive sneak of EYES WIDE SHUT, I hyped myself up for this film.  I watched parts of 2001, and all of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE on my DVD player at home, the night before I saw EYES WIDE SHUT.  And when I saw EYES WIDE SHUT, I was prepared. My heart was racing when I saw the Warner Bros. symbol, then the words ""Warner Bros. Presents"" ""Tom Cruise"" ""Nicole Kidman"" ""In A Stanely Kubrick Film.""  The eerie carnival-waltz music playing in the background, while the viewer sees the back-side of Nicole Kidman, as she's undressing.  The viewer sees Kidman, undress until she's completely nude.  Then the words ""EYES WIDE SHUT"" appear.  And from there on, I went though the most complex plot and thought provoking film that I have seen since ""THE MATRIX.""  This film really took me out of my theater seat, and into the world of Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise). This is a brilliant film from a brilliant director!  Stanley Kubrick proved that throughout his carrer, he didn't make one bad movie.  And I feel that EYES WIDE SHUT should be placed with Kubrick's other classics: DR. STRANGELOVE, THE KILLING, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, 2001, THE SHINING, and the rest of his films.  This is a film that you have to go to, and please bring your intellegence, otherwise, it won't make any sense.  After watching this film with a couple of friends, we discussed how complex the plot was of this film.  And days later, we still talk about certain scenes and plot points in the film. It's like going to a crime scene, and trying to figure out who did the murder, and what was the motive. What other director can do this to a film!  Kubrick tells both so much, and so little.  He let's the viewer think about what's going on, but doesn't show it.  He'll let the viewer think about what's going to happen, but won't say.  Very few director's in Hollywood or in the film industry will do this.  Instead they would rather ""entertain"" the viewer. They tell the story, let the viewer know what happend, and what's going to happen to them in the future, and then give them a happy ending.  Kubrick isn't like that, he doesn't make entertainment, he makes art.  2001 is one of the few films that I would say, deserves a gold frame around it's screen, and placed in the Louve in Paris. EYES WIDE SHUT is another film that deserves that same treatment.  This is a work of art,the editing, the cinematography, the acting, the errie music, and the story are all done with a touch of brillance.  This is a worthy film of Kubrick's. Unlike other film critic's I respect Stanley Kubrick and his family very much.  So out of respect, I will not reveal any of the plot points or discuss the plot.  The plot of the film is both too simple and complex to discuss.  It's something that needs to been seen, to understand.  But I will mention this, Kubrick fans will notice Kubrick using some of his famous directing moves in this film. The Christmas party in EYES WIDE SHUT looks very similar to the Gold Ballroom scene in THE SHINING.  The following the character around the huge building without cutting, or doing a different camera angle.  The unique camera angles, the very rapid long shot to extreme close up shot (done in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE when Alex sees his old droogs become officer's.  And in THE SHINING when Wendy sees the shocking mirror reflection of the word ""murder"").  And the single character standing alone in a big room, or walking down the street. No surprise, I found this not only one of the best films of the year, but also of all time.  I'm sad that were not going to see another Kubrick film.  But I am glad that I lived in a time to see his work.  To be both influenced and astonished at the same time, while watching his movies. Farewell Stanley, thank you very much for the works of art, and may you rest in peace.   ***** (out of five)",Eyes Wide Shut
173,PCC0921,Kubrick does what he meant to do in this film.,8,12 October 2020,"What drew me into this film, so much, is the story and the thriller-aspect of the whole thing. The dialogue and acting was bad, the film itself was a little long, but what I think Kubrick was trying to tap into was his version of an old Italian, erotic thriller from the 1970s and those interpretive-abstract, one or two, person plays in old bars that they used to do back in the late 60s/early 70s.Shot in Kubrick's standard 4:3 aspect ratio (a Kubrick staple), it looks fine and has that grainy film-stock look that I always liked about his films. I wound up staying with it all the way to the end and I didn't feel robbed at all. Nicole was very good and I found myself enjoying her American accent. Pollack was very good too. There is a nicely done scene at a party, with the patronage wearing masks, that helped with the creepy edge that Kubrick was trying to establish.

This was the first Tom Cruise movie I ever enjoyed, which made me realize its not the actors but the way the director uses them which is important. I love the levels Kubrick takes us to. Cruise's character here thinks he wound up in some very dangerous almost satanic situation, but in reality is no more afraid than those rich bastards are of him telling and making scandal about the far our party he gatecrashed. There easily could have been the president at that orgy. I like this film very much, its quite a trip really. Nothing is predictable.",Eyes Wide Shut
175,MF210,One of those films that improves on repeated viewings,9,11 September 2011,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.Back in 1999, Eyes Wide Shut was one of the most anticipated films of the year, only the Phantom Menace was more anticipated. Being Stanley Kubrick's final film and starring then married couple Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman, there was good reason for it to be so anticipated. Critical reception was positive but underwhelming, critics mostly admired the film but few called it a masterpiece. Audience response was mixed to negative, Eyes Wide Shut was a modest box office success based solely on it's two stars. The opinion of some of Kubrick's films have changed drastically over the years. 2001 and The Shining received mixed to negative responses when they first debuted, now both are viewed as seminal masterpieces in their genre. It'll be interesting how Eyes Wide Shut is viewed in another ten years, I'm not so sure how it's overall legacy has changed much in the twelve years since it debuted. My opinion of Eyes Wide Shut on the first viewing was that it was an interesting failure. It had some memorable scenes and images but I just didn't see the point in the film. For the most part, it seemed like Kubrick was going through the motions and it was an underwhelming way to end a brilliant career. To say my opinion has changed is an understatement. While I would not call Eyes Wide Shut a masterpiece, I will say it is a very worthy addition to Stanley Kubrick's oeuvre and a fitting conclusion to his career. When I watch it now I see a film with some very memorable scenes and rich images, but also a fascinating look at jealousy and sexual temptation. What wasn't apparent to me on the first viewing has become so on repeated ones. The gratuitous sex doesn't seem pointless anymore, it's there for a reason. Give Kubrick credit for making sex seem so unappealing and mechanical, he's making a statement about the human condition. Sex isn't about love in EWS, very little of the sex is an act of love here, it's about filling urges and temptations. EWS has the same striking visual style as previous Kubrick films. The film has a dream-like atmosphere, which has lead some people to believe that much of what is transpiring on the screen is a dream through Tom Cruise's character. The most memorable scene is the sexual orgy, it's very Gothic with the black cloaks and the masks worn by the characters. This scene ranks up there with the most memorable imagery in Kubrick's films. Another memorable scene is Tom Cruise's character being stalked through the streets of New York. On the first viewing, I was not crazy about Tom Cruise's performance, I would've described it as ""wooden."" While I don't view it as great work and there are few instances where the performance falls flat, I think it is a generally solid performance. Nicole Kidman, though she has lesser screen time, is consistently excellent, taking attention away from Cruise every time they're on screen together. EWS is a complex film that's difficult to describe and hard to take in on a single viewing. This film needs to be watched more than once to be appreciated. Perhaps it's not for everyone, which describes most of Kubrick's films, but for the adventurous film watcher, EWS is a worthy film.",Eyes Wide Shut
176,arabnikita,Kubrick's last work of Art,10,22 April 2017,"Eyes Wide Shut...last movie by the great Stanley Kubrick. Like all art, and most of Kubrick's movies, it is really hard to explain the movie in a few words. Those who have seen his previous works will enjoy this one, those who haven't might hate it. The film has a slow pace with great cinematography, mechanics and obviously acting. From beginning to end the whole movie happens in a dream-like state of trans where the characters go through a set of bizarre experiences and desires only to be unsure if they are awake or asleep at the end of it all. Like all Kubrick's films, this one contains a very powerful theme and message and certainly, movies like that will not be made today. This movie is not for everyone; some will enjoy it today, others may enjoy it 10 years from now.This is one of those films that will leave you thinking for days and weeks and I might still discover more things that I like about it 5 or 10 years from now.",Eyes Wide Shut
177,kurosawakira,A World of Its Own,8,21 February 2013,"I remember when Kubrick passed away. I read it in the morning newspaper, and was struck with deep sadness I couldn't explain. Mind you, I was not even 12 years old at the time and had barely seen any of his films. So I went to see ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999) at the cinema. I credit it, along with Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998), as an experience that ignited my interest in film, since they were both films like I had never seen before. Sure, there's that one reason why a young lad might be interested in this, but I was so struck by its atmosphere and narrative flow that I had to read Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle"". And how disappointed I was in how unalike they were. The film was in a world of its own that had a sense of time that was its own, a sense of colour that was its own, a sense of light that was its own. Every movement was languid, every word deliberate.I never really thought about the connection between this and Malick's film until now, but really, they both move in the realm of dreams and memories and projected, subjective realities – between something that did happen (to someone) and something that might have happened. There's ellipsis, ambiguity, metaphor. Both work their magic in visual terms. I'm soaked in that light from the ball even by recalling the images in my mind as I'm writing this.Fidelio – enter.",Eyes Wide Shut
178,grandmastersik,Tom Cruise throws his money around in a big non-event,4,15 September 2015,"Tom Cruise is so rich that he can give hookers $150 for nothing, and men who pimp out their daughters, $200 tips on fancy dress costume rentals.Um, I think that was the plot - or maybe I missed something? For what feels like a very, very long time, Tom Cruise meanders around New York, angry about his wife saying she once thought about cheating on him, after she felt offended by him telling her that the only reason he didn't have a threesome with two super hot models is because it would have hurt her.The advertisements at the time made this film out to be about some kind of cabal/swingers club, but the part with the masks is more like a side-note throwaway. A shame, since a decent thriller could have come from those events being the main plot. No, the film is actually about Tom Cruise strolling around, thinking about cheating on his wife... or has he already?That will probably be the talking point amongst film buffs: the dying man's daughter confessed to being in love with him and he did seem to be very cosy with the residence and the maid... but, like I said, it's a point for fans to discuss, and being a Stanley Kubrik film, there are bound to be plenty.The reason Kubrik has these fans is simple: the directing is top-notch. The opening one-shot scene is brilliant in its nonchalance and Tom Cruise really does shine as an actor - not just that average, albeit good-looking bloke from Risky Business who, somehow, became cinema's equivalent to Elvis.Unfortunately, the same praise cannot be given to Kidman. Yes, awful dialogue can be partly to blame (though, in some parts the dialogue is very natural), but she just came across as stupid and annoying, and really not the kind of woman I could imagine Tom Cruise's Dr. Hartford ever having married.The final verdict: an okay film in terms of idle entertainment, but don't waste your time looking for hidden depth.Oh, and if you ever meet Tom Cruise, don't ask for his autograph - ask for a couple of hundred dollars.",Eyes Wide Shut
179,WubsTheFadger,Eyes Wide Shut,8,3 February 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe story is extremely yet elegantly complex and thoughtful. There are numerous scenes that are symbolic and a handful of metaphors throughout the film. The story is deep and deals with the human condition as it relates infidelity. The ending in my eyes did seem a little weak.The acting is very good. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman both do a great job at portraying their respective characters. Tom Cruise plays a vulnerable man who is torn between revenge and doing what is right. The only downside of the acting is that Tom Cruise doesn't play the doctor role very well. He just doesn't look like a doctor.The music is the part of the film. The music perfectly blends with the film giving it a sense of wonder and mystery.The pacing is a little slow and the runtime is overlong. The tone is mysterious, dark, and unsettling.There is an abundant amount of nudity throughout the film. The nudity is there as a symbol. It symbolizes the temptation of infidelity.Pros: Elegant and complex story, well crafted symbols and metaphors, good acting, stunning use of music, storing yet varying tone, and a great use of nudity as a symbol of infidelityCons: Overlong runtime, Tom Cruise as a doctor, some slow pacing, and a weak endingOverall Rating: 8.2",Eyes Wide Shut
180,allyjack,An old man's film,4,19 July 1999,"The movie, scene by scene, is often embarrassing, with blandly functional, declamatory dialogue delivered slowly, oh so slowly; the performances are exactly what you'd expect if multiple takes had squeezed the life and the will out of the actors. It's mostly shapeless, especially when Cruise seems to revisit every earlier scene in the movie to little effect; the movie is awash in a softcore art-movie cliched view of nudity; the ritualistic sex is mostly ludicrous and the climax...well, it s not much of a payoff. It s not that I can t see the things people cite as proof of the film s greatness - it s just hard to value them that highly. Certainly, there s an occasionally hypnotic ritualistic air, a feeling of heightened unreality in which the boundary between dreams and reality is untrustworthy - the movie periodically quivers under its severe vision of the weakness of the flesh; the privileged lushness of the settings heightens the fragility and shock of subversion. These undercurrents are interesting, but not enough to make the thing predominantly enjoyable. It's an old man's film; out of touch with the raw material of life (and perhaps even of dreams).",Eyes Wide Shut
181,drosse67,Captivating,10,17 April 2002,"Stanley Kubrick's final movie should not be judged against other domestic dramas or thrillers.  It must be compared to his previous films, and you must also take into consideration Kubrick himself.  He must not have been well while he made it, and he left behind, a few months after his death, a film that many have called ""unfinished.""  (Perhaps he meant to put some different music over the ""piano piece"" that is remembered by most people who've seen this movie). The film is like a dream; not much of the central orgy passage makes sense in relation to the events before or after it, but the film is gripping nonetheless.  It is basically about what lack of communication between two people can do to a marriage, or in the case of Tom Cruise's character, one's sanity.  His ""odyssey"" that leads to the Long Island mansion is the result of what happens when a husband takes a wrong turn, and acts on pure impulse, after an argument with this wife and turning off his emotions, when he should have been upfront with them.  Much has been said about the central orgy sequence, which for me recalled The Wicker Man (a movie that also featured a stranger infiltrating a cult-like event, with participants in eerie masks and costumes, with tragic consequences).  The final irony of this misunderstood film, though, comes from Nicole Kidman's last line in the movie.  The final line in the final Kubrick film is nearly as memorable as the film itself, and darkly funny to boot. Give this movie a few years, and it will be re-evaluated and designated a masterpiece, like many of Kubrick's films from 2001 to The Shining.",Eyes Wide Shut
182,danielll_rs,"Congratulations, Kubrick! 10/10",9,2 September 1999,"I've seen ""Eyes Wide Shut"" this afternoon and I thought it was incredible. OK, it is quite slow, but it is good to forget its failures and enjoy the qualities. Stanley Kubrick proves that he was one of the greatest directors of all the times, and he still is in the memory of his fans. Everything in the film is on its place, so let's start with the cast.Nicole Kidman has a terrific performance and deserves an Oscar nomination, or even win. She surprised me, because she has already done many bad films (""Practical Magic"", ""Batman Forever"", etc). Here she plays Alice Harford, the wife who has almost betrayed her husband. He is Tom Cruise, another one who surprised me for the same reason. He plays Dr. Bill Harford, the 'almost betrayed' husband ready to face some sexual adventures. The supporting actors and actresses were also great. Kubrick really cares about all the characters. We can see this in Sidney Pollack's acting, but there are others: the strange owner of 'Rainbow Fashions' and his daughter, the pianist Nick Nightingale, the hotel desk clerk, the people in the orgy.The scenes are just wonderful. The orgy... Oh, the orgy! Perfect, perfect, perfect! Only Kubrick could imagine those disturbing and at the same time fascinating scenes.The soundtrack is also perfect. The music can tell you a story...We can't say ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a drama, or a romance, or a mystery film. It is a film about many things: love, wedding, betrayal, sex, revenge, redemption, etc.If you're looking for sex, really strong sexuality, you'll be disappointed. The sex and the nudity in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" are not on the screen all the time. Oh, right! It is also about sex, but Kubrick doesn't abuse of the sexuality.The art-set direction, the screenplay, the dialogues... Everything wonderful!So if you're looking for a real good film; not only to spend the time, but to think, this is the one. I think it'll be nominated in the main categories in the next Academy Awards. At least it really deserves.A warn: it is a very complex film, so pay attention in everything.",Eyes Wide Shut
183,Ibuk,A shockingly real portrayal of a marriage,8,6 July 2008,"This is my third favourite Kubrick movie, 2001 being my favourite and ACO being second Eyes Wide Shut is nevertheless a great movie backed by powerful performances from Cruise and Kidman. The first time I watched it I was pretty unimpressed,much like the first time I saw 2001 and that is now my favourite movie. The second time round I liked it a lot more. Eyes Wide Shut paints a very honest and mature picture of marriage and in that lies it's beauty.Despite not being married I can completely identify with Nicole Kidman,she is a bored housewife who fantasises about other men to spice up her life. When she discloses this to hubby Mr Cruise he then goes on a downhill spiral and the implications it has on their marriage. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were brilliant in their roles as husband and wife. I suppose I may as well admit that I initially brought the DVD for Nicole Kidman and her skin show(trust me she did not disappoint me in that area) but I was not expecting to immensely enjoy it which I did. It really is an absolute shame that Mr Kubrick could not bask in it's glory for long, he died shortly after making it. Eyes Wide Shut is another addition to Mr Kubrick's fine work as a director and the industry is poorer place without him.",Eyes Wide Shut
184,Jonathon_Natsis,The Last Temptation of Kubrick,8,21 April 2011,"It seems nothing short of totally appropriate that the last film ever made by master director Stanley Kubrick (it's widely believed he died just four days after presenting Warner Brothers with the final cut) is unmistakeably Kubrickian in every way. To some this means drawn-out, tiresome scenes that serve little purpose, contributing to a final film far too steeped in 'fancy-pants' storytelling to ever appeal to the masses. But to others, it implies a deeply metaphorical and meaningful film abundant with visual clues, surreal scenarios and a climax deliberately lacking answers. Eyes Wide Shut is a modern adaption of the 1926 novel Traumnovelle, and opens with a depiction of the well-to-do lifestyle led by Dr Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) as they attend an upper-class ball. During the night, each of them captures the interests of the opposite sex. In a fit of drug-induced anger and jealousy upon returning home, Alice admits to a fantasy she entertained involving a naval officer on a previous family holiday. And Bill, in a state of sheer disbelief, leaves the house and hits the streets of New York, unintentionally embarking on a sexually charged adventure of his own. The acting cannot be faulted, but rather than being the highlight of the film, it simply serves to support the many themes on display. At the most basic level, this subversion of the erotic thriller has a lot to say about the craving for sex not as an expression of love, but an outlet for self-satisfaction in keeping with the primal instincts of this advanced race known as human beings. Personally, I prefer to assess the parallels drawn between this film and Homer's Odyssey, in which Bill, much like our ancient protagonist, acts as a positive energy against the crippling forces of hubris, jealousy and the need for revenge. This allows the film to work in a cautionary moral without sounding preachy or undermining the integrity of the subject matter. It is the bizarre characters and scenarios that Bill encounters on his lone night(s) out that contribute to the film's message and the vast range of interpretations it has garnered. The series of events would not seem entirely out of place in a movie by the Coen brothers, but unlike the light heartedness of The Big Lebowski, or pure storytelling of True Grit, these scenes are inherently more sinister. Bill encounters, among others, a prostitute he opts against sleeping with (before finding out she tested positive to HIV), a costume shop owner who realises he can make an extra buck by whoring out his underage daughter, and a famous set piece involving an anonymous orgy in a labyrinth of a mansion, which plays a huge part in influencing Bill and the path his life may possibly follow.Of course, each of the above scenes in some way reflect the different attitudes different people may have towards sex, and are far too obvious to be individually mentioned in this review. What they do so well, however, is compound the main character's mindset with more and more ferocity until, finally, he has an epiphany about the sacredness of fidelity.Unfortunately, upon release in the summer of '99, the public accepted Eyes Wide Shut poorly, perhaps due to a misleading advertising campaign marketing the film as an action-packed, semi-noir thriller with nudity by the truckload. Okay, that last part might be true, but make no mistake: it is plentiful, but never glorified. In fact, because it is so prominent, the only eventual course of action for the cautious viewer is to accept it, and its significance in the story. If by now you're still in two minds about this film, it is certainly not for everyone, particularly those who can't stand slow pacing. The film moves at a snail's pace with no exceptions, but patience is rewarded. As for the deeply metaphorical aspect, one needn't look any further than the title (one of the most unique in film history) to gain yet another perspective on this film. Which is a good thing, because if it were up to me, I'd have gone with The Sexy Adventures of Dr Bill.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Kubrick created another masterpiece that confused the audiences for one more time, proving that only a very small percentage of the population can grasp some of the realities of this world.Let me give you a hint. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is not a crime movie. It is not a thriller either. It depicts the life of a man with a high social stature who looses dignity and control as soon as he accepts his partner's sexual urges. Ultimately he discovers his self again, after he takes a small trip into the night.Kubrick's sensibilities and talent are all present here. The lust, doubt and fear of the characters are projected to the audience with full control and great rhythm. The music score is undescribable. No one has ever injected a movie with a soundtrack that takes over all of your senses. Photography is brilliant too.Anyway, don't try to solve the crime, all you reality show lovers out there. There isn't one.10/10",Eyes Wide Shut
189,jrfranklin01,Definitely A Sexual Odyssey,4,20 December 2004,"This film was described as a sexual odyssey and that much is true. It's also director Stanley Kubrick's last film (I think I might actually be happy about that). I know countless people have debated what this film really meant and probably over-analyzed it to the point they injected their own creativity into it. My viewpoint is much more practical and simple I think, albeit I still don't know why Stanley was so fascinated by sexuality to choose a final film about it. I got the impression the film was more for effect and remembrance than anything else. Given the it's lack of taste and gratuitousness, I would agree.""Eyes Wide Shut"" starts out in unveiling the life of a well-to-do couple. It gives particular attention to Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) on an emotional and physical level to show a woman in all her sexuality. I think it attempts to show the physical desires a woman has with her maternal nature and her sincere affections. This schism in a woman's feelings is flip-flopped back and forth throughout the film and almost appears as if Kubrick might be showing some satirical misogyny...? Alice quickly becomes an over-the-top bimbo at a social event with her doctor husband, Bill Harford (then, real-life husband Tom Cruise). I think Kubrick thought the display of a real-life couple (especially stars) would not only draw public attention but would also allow for a better film due to the established chemistry. But this was my first disappointment. For two real-life lovers, I felt their encounters were sometimes forced or awkward and unconvincing. Their interaction with the daughter felt very unnatural, especially with Cruise's part. I mentioned misogyny earlier and I'll elaborate. Alice is intoxicated and soon begins flirting with an older man who is trying to seduce her. She acts (as I said) like a complete bimbo. But the encounter serves the purpose of creating a debate between Alice and her husband about attraction and trust. She verbally attacks her husband to try and find some sort infidelity in his at least having sexual thoughts about another person. This brings to the surface Alice's own hidden sexual thoughts she has kept from her husband. She confesses having entertained sexual thoughts about someone other than her husband. She goes on to say that she would have sacrificed everything (husband, marriage, child, etc.) for a one-night stand with a man she saw at a hotel. Bill Harford is portrayed as a real gentleman and very devoted to his wife and child. He is loosely-cohesive after receiving the shocking confessional from his wife. But he still believes women aren't as sexual and willing to do the things men do. Reinforcing the meaning of Alice's confession, a women tells Bill she loves him and wants him. This comes as a shock since he hardly knows her. Her sincerity scares him as it shows how women can have thoughts for other men without giving the slightest intimation. What generates a negative view of women is in the subsequent collapse of Bill's fidelity. His wife's mental cheating acts as the impetus for his own destruction. Man destruction appears to be the fault of a woman's sexual uncontrollability. Alice's confession and the thought of infidelity (on any level) torment Bill into attempting to commit the reality of her thoughts. You could also look at the plot for this film as removing gender from sex and showing both males and females as having the same desires, drives, and secrets. It still shows Bill as a horse put into motion by his wife's secret eroticism. Bill ends up with a whore as a way to get back at his wife and indulge himself. Luckily, he is saved by a phone call which keeps him from making a marital mistake. That's still strike one on the close-call scale. Next he calls the woman's house that confessed her attraction to him. The phone is answered by her boyfriend and Bill hangs up. That's strike two. Bill then ends up going back to see the whore, Domino, but finds out she is not home. After trying to put the moves on her roommate, he is given the news that Domino was diagnosed with AIDS. That's strike three on the close-call scale! Well, you know what they say after three strikes.And out goes Bill (*SPOILERS BELOW*). He still can't stop himself as if on some sexual adventure. He finds out about a private costume party that hosts orgies. This fuels Bill's fire as he gets the secret password (ironically it's Fidelio) and a costume. In probably the most memorable scene of the film, Bill is shown at an occult hedonistic masquerade. An intentionally jarring set of piano keys follow throughout and into the rest of the film - more Kubrick signature bizarrity. Without going into all the details, Bill witnesses some pretty raunchy and shocking things. But just as he's been warned by some mysterious hooker to leave, he is discovered as an interloper. The negative consequences of Bill's departure from fidelity soon become apparent as it appears as if his life might be in jeopardy. His inquiries into the events from the party yield a dead body and a kidnapped friend. The party and its darkness envelope the remainder of the film. Two other scenes show a dark sexual perspective - the costume owner becoming a pimp for his daughter and the revelation of Bill's close friend as one of the orgy's members.All of this appears as the dirty foam of some wave that just crashed on the beach. It is the deluge from a intense storm brought about by sex. In one of the more controversial parts of the film, Bill returns home late after hearing his friend's revelation. He finds the mask from the orgy masquerade on the pillow next to his wife. He lost the mask somehow before returning it the store. Some people have suggested his wife found the mask and put it there. I am more apt to believe, since she did not know of the mask's significance, that someone from the party broke into his house and put it there as a warning. That is why Bill breaks down and confesses everything to his wife.The ending is just as strange as the rest of the film, so I guess it's no surprise. True to his intended depiction of women, Kubrick has Kidman deliver a speech with a surprising sexually-expletive ending. I don't know what Stanley thinks he's accomplished here. And what makes him the authority on women and their sexuality? ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was just too creepy and awkwardly ""Basic Instinct"" to be very credible. Especially the whole orgy thing, although I doubt I will forget it anytime soon. It scares me that those kind of things probably go on. Some sick insanely-rich people. 4/10",Eyes Wide Shut

191,jake-law123,What a way for Kubrick to go out.,7,22 July 2011,"Knowing Kubrick's style of movies, the explicit content in his movies, and the creepy style he does his movies in, I knew this last Kubrick project would be quite a thrill. Dying right after the movie was made, of a heart attack, I had a feeling Kubrick knew the end was near, and decided to go all out before he went out. And what a way to do it. This movie has Kubrick written all over it. This movie intrigued me quite a bit. Although it may seem like a usual Kubrick style movie, it quickly turns into a nonstop series of nude everywhere, and creepiness all around.New York doctor Bill Hartford, (Tom Cruise) has an argument with his wife, (Nichole Kidman) about being faithful with each other one night when they're both stoned after returning from a party. This leads her to reveal at one point in their marriage when she had a sexual fantasy with a man they met on vacation with their daughter, and was ready to give up her future with her husband and daughter just to sleep with him. This causes him to go out in the streets of New York, filled with jealousy and sexual flames, on a nonstop discovery of moral and sexual intercourse.He encounters a hooker, an awkward intrusion of a costume owner's daughter fooling around with two Asians, and a mansion where a ritual of sexual orgies is taking place. All fitting in one night, and continues on the next day, consuming you with tons of confusion, and questions you're just dying to know. By the time most of the more screwed up scenes are finished, they will leave you speechless and filled with curiosity. The hardest part of this film is not knowing whats going on, which can get a little on your nerves.Though it is a little slow, most Kubrick films are. Its not too bad, and it does build up pretty well. The music score by Jocelyn Pook is outstanding. That suspenseful piano piece that shows whenever somethings going on just gets shivers right down your spine.I couldn't believe the amount of nudity in this film. Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, (1971) which is rated X, doesn't even have as much nudity as this, which I didn't think was possible, which is shocking considering Kubrick could have had it much worse, though he decided to block most of the sex shown, for rating issues, though the film is still rated NC-17.A truly terrifying thriller which is one of Kubrick's most shocking, yet highly intelligent drama thrillers, which will have you on the edge of your seat. Although not as good as A Clockwork Orange, its still one of the most thrilling films ever, and will live on in the legend of Stanley Kubrick forever.",Eyes Wide Shut

The danger of working as a prostitute (and the danger of having sex with a prostitute) is revealed, as the roommate tells the doctor that the hooker he hired the night before, but did not have sex with, has just discovered out she's HIV positive. Something that was unrealistic and inconsistent with an earlier scene was the costume shop owner happily using his underage daughter as a prostitute. This should have been edited out. Another weakness is a too-long conversation between the doctor and his wife, and the overly long and repetitive conversation between the wife and the man she was dancing with. There are still some important unanswered questions at the end (I will not post a spoiler and say what they are), but the mystery is presented in an intelligent way, unlike in some other movies, and so doesn't annoy the viewer, but instead makes one think.",Eyes Wide Shut
193,toqtaqiya2,The final work of legendary director Stanley Kubrick.,8,10 November 2010,"Stanley Kubrick's detractors used his showmanship as a criticism of his films, claiming that they were only simple stories writ portentously and pompously large, all form and no substance. And these detractors were never so merciless - or so numerous - as they were with his final film, Eyes Wide Shut, which was released posthumously in the summer of 1998. The incentive came fast and furious. The film was too slow. Its vision of New York was hopelessly out of touch. It was misogynist. It was ugly. Its notion of sexuality was old-fashioned. It was unfinished. The rumours were dished out to a public that finally had no use for this most intimate and nakedly emotional of Kubrick's films. Eyes Wide Shut is the story of a young Manhattan doctor (Tom Cruise) who uses his wife's (Nicole Kidman) spontaneous confession of past unrequited desire for another man as license to explore his own desires, only to encounter an endless series of prohibitions and frustrations. For those who went to Kubrick's film with their eyes wide open, it is one of his greatest films, composed and enacted in dream logic, set in the ravishing tones of fin-de-siecle Viennese painting. Kubrick uses his two dedicated superstars to dig deep into uncomfortable emotional issues. He may have lived in England for the last 35 years of his life, and he may have been a towering artist, but Kubrick was also the last of the great American showmen. He knew how to deliver a total experience. Like most of his work, Eyes Wide Shut will make the shift to classic status.",Eyes Wide Shut
194,diand_,Beyond perfection: Sculpting in light,10,22 February 2005,"Kubrick experimented with styles and changes in styles in the narrative. Here he changes the standpoint in the narrative from a movie about relationships to a thriller and then changes once again to more philosophical issues. Inside these major styles there are smaller changes in storytelling, introducing sub-layers in the story. Furthermore, the movie repeatedly questions its own existence and portrayal of events.Camera-work is once again amazing. Every shot is perfect, it feels like sculpting in light. A wide variety of lenses and color scheme's is used. Take for example the wonderful scene in the pool room that is pivotal in the movie and took so much time. (Note also the congruity in that scene between the change in the actor's positions and the change in the story). Colors are also used to code the whole movie (with a crazy amount of detail: even the fence is blue).After these aspects, there's the story. Eyes Wide Shut explores the other side of a faithful life: Bill Harford enters an unfamiliar world where he doesn't know the rules. But there's also commentary about these worlds: the masks, the shabby apartment, the daughter prostitute. The character of Alice(!) suggesting the mystery.Kubrick thought of this movie as his best ever. It is. It is probably the best movie ever made. In a few years time it will (as usual with him) be heralded as a masterpiece.",Eyes Wide Shut
195,Kubris,Kubrick's legend,9,3 June 2012,"Well, this is it. After two months I've seen every Kubrick film in order, from Fear and Desire to Eyes Wide Shut. And while I was a bit nervous about how then- 70 year old Kubrick would handle the topic of sex with Hollywood stars after a decade off from directing, I have to applaud this absolutely wonderful surprise of film, horribly underrated on this site, the IMDb.Eyes Wide Shut channels much of Kubrick's previous work, such as A Clockwork Orange and 2001 while crafting its own unique identity. If you've ever wondered how directors from previous eras would fair in this generation, look no further: this film shows evolution. It's impossible to believe that this was made by the same man who made The Killing. But don't believe that this film is great because of its director or his past work: the score reflects my opinion of the film on its own.Summarizing Eyes Wide Shut is difficult: the plot consists of a couple fighting and he walks into a series of events causing an awakening. Is it romantic? Nope. Thriller, or a mystery? Yep, and a bit scary in places too. But for the the entire 2.5+ hour runtime its engaging, and constantly interesting. You'll wonder what happens next and how it all plays out, and there's a sense of wonder throughout: movie magic. I wonder if Kubrick knew this was going to be his last film, because he references so much of his previous work, something I haven't noticed him to do much. Notably from Clockwork and Lolita is the content. From 2001 there is a sense of realization. Such as learning about the moment we evolved into what we are today, Eyes Wide Shut ironically opens our eyes to aspects of life we tend to pass over. A revolution.And from Barry Lyndon and Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut draws beauty. This film is beautiful to see, with extravagant upper class parties and a living city. I was shocked to learn this was all filmed in England.From this film I appreciate Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman more as actors. Working with Kubrick was never easy, especially on this film's long shoot. Both leads perform excellently, and are perfect for the characters. They were up to the challenges and demands of the film, and the offscreen parallels don't hurt either.I can't believe this is a 7.2. Maybe it's the hype, or maybe some just didn't like the length. But everything serves its purpose in Eyes Wide Shut, like the greatest films. Eyes Wide Shut is an excellent film, a great swan song from the greatest director of all time who left my eyes wide open. 8.7/10",Eyes Wide Shut
196,adrongardner,Strange Love,8,19 January 2009,"Like other Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is interesting but also a bit of a strange film. Perhaps that is being too definite or even unkind. Most of Stanley Kubrick's films are simply unlike any other. So yes, Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. There are some very bizarre, moments in the movie, but this is precisely what makes it work the way it does. Whatever faults the work may posses, and these too may be debatable, the movie is a memorable and complete work of originality.Eyes Wide Shut is a classically constructed work that is both very simple but also complex and full of depth. It is mysterious, sexy and also quite funny. While the leads Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman aren't particularly sharp, there are some great performances in the varied cast, mostly from the side characters that pop in from time to time. Rade Serbedzija and Allen Cumming are two of the many standouts.If you're familiar with the Arthur Schnitzler original novella, you'll find the core story to be very faithful. Without laying out a lengthy synopsis, which this complex film would require, it is safe to say this is essentially a fantasy film. Schnitzler's story confronted the fantasies, temptations and occasional ambiguities of marriage. More to the point, as a plot point in the film eludes to, the notion of fidelity.The story unfolds in a series of small vignettes, all revolving around the notion of sexual attraction and the fantasy of such. It is never truly made clear of what parts we are seeing could be true, or what could be essentially a fantasy. As the final lines of the book and the movie lay out to us, Some things are real and others are just fantasy. It is a very clever and rich way for a story to unfold. Well that's the idea anyway.Examining the film's strengths and weaknesses, you may find, there really is no way to find any solid faults. In execution, much like Full Metal Jacket, the movie has an uneven pace of plotting. While Barry Lyndon's deliberate method of story-telling was highly appropriate. The Shining's slow but steady pace also had its advantages. Here in Eyes Wide Shut, I feel the main flaw is the movie could move much faster.Some individual scenes play out absolutely flat, most of these being the scenes between Cruise and Kidman. But even as they can feel flat, these scenes can also be seen as highlighting the monotony of their married life. But pacing wise, they just don't work. On the other hand, the pace and plotting are far more engaging than the similar, but abominable ""Mulholland Drive"" from David Lynch. There are moments of great depth and visual power in this film. I don't see how more original a film can be made in fact. Eyes Wide Shut, I think, is fearless in examining the timeless issue of fidelity. When is fantasy good? When is it dangerous? What conversations with your significant other are better left unsaid? These questions are handled in a much more mature and profound way than the occasional schlock nonsense of a Woody Allen relationship film where people complain for an hour and a half. While Eyes Wide Shut is flawed in some ways, it is also a wonderful and memorable trip worth taking if you have an open mind and aren't expecting Sleepless in Seattle. Uneven but interesting and completely original.",Eyes Wide Shut
197,cashbacher,It is hard to discern a purpose,3,19 August 2020,"The plot of this movie starts rather basic, a rich, attractive married couple are both having unusual thoughts regarding the course of their marriage. Tom Cruise is Dr. Bill Harford, a man that is sometimes asked to practice medicine and keep his mouth shut about it. Nichole Kidman is his wife Alice and she surprises Bill when she admits to having had fantasies about having an affair some time before. So far, nothing outside the plotlines of many movies.
However, when Bill encounters an old friend that is now a keyboard player and learns that he sometimes plays blindfolded at secret locations, Bill decides he must attend an upcoming event. Bill becomes involved with some secret society where the observers are costumed and masked and there are many beautiful young women willing to be sex partners.
The plot turns rather strange, even for such rituals and there are hints and counter-hints of great danger for Bill, Alice and their young daughter. There is an extremely ambiguous ending, it is hard to even speculate on what the actual outcome was.
Despite the revelation of significant amounts of attractive female flesh, this movie is dull and hard to watch. This was actually the third time that I tried to watch it and the only reason I made it through this time was because Iowa had a horrific storm with hurricane force winds that knocked power out to over 90% of the people in the county. I was home being powered by a generator when I watched it to the end.",Eyes Wide Shut
198,Svenstadt,Boring and juvenile peep show.,3,10 October 2021,"This movie has the feel of a peep show or something. It's just awful. You never got the sense that the good Dr. And his wife had trouble in their marriage. In this sense, the writer got this one wrong. What should be Nicole Kidman's character as the center of the story, then gets derailed. This is, instead, the painfully slow odyssey of a New York doctor (Cruise), as he embarks upon some sort of juvenile, teenaged voyeur fantasy?? The worst part was the pool table scene, where Sydney Pollack's character has to explain to the grown man Dr. What was actually happening, in juvenile fashion!! The nebulous nature of the story is the worst. Nicole Kidman's character is never really developed well enough to understand what her motivations are. Is this just the bad time of the month for her, when she said those hurtful things to her husband??",Eyes Wide Shut

""I can prove I'm a great intellect by saing I 'understand' this final Kubrick offering"". So they'll say. IT DIDN'T WORK, in part or as a whole. Self-obsessed baloney in the tradition of Eric von Stroheim's films. Enough.",Eyes Wide Shut
200,FilmSnobby,Moldy. Very moldy.,3,5 July 2004,"Just the other night, I saw this movie again on HBO, which has been re-running it for some inexplicable reason. My dislike of it hasn't changed in the 5 intervening years since I first saw it. Although it's not quite the UNMITIGATED disaster some claim, *Eyes Wide Shut* is still pretty ludicrous: there will be no later revising-upward of critical opinion, a la*2001: A Space Odyssey*. It will rather be remembered for more morbid reasons; to wit, for killing Kubrick and sundering the marriage of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.For the real-life peripherals surrounding the movie were more interesting than the movie itself -- which, I'm sorry to say, is really, really, really old hat for cinephiles. I realize that this film and its director have a huge fan-club, as evidenced by hundreds of glowing -- if naive -- reviews on this website, but please spare me the lectures that my dislike of the film indicates that I ""just don't get it"". No, YOU don't get it. *Eyes Wide Shut* is ""art-house cinema"" for the lazy people, for the people who can't be bothered to force themselves to watch all those subtitled foreign movies from several decades ago that have already, and AMPLY, covered this same material. Doubtless, these same lazy people haven't bothered to read much Schnitzler or even Freud, for that matter. And thus, they're not bored to death by *Eyes Wide Shut*. They see ""genius"", while I'm looking at the same old thing. I dunno, but from where I sit, Schnitzler's psycho-sexual theories, while provocative in the mid-Twenties when he wrote the story on which this film is based, are anachronisms in today's culture that boasts of an 50%+ divorce rate. And so what's the result of Kubrick's unwieldy update of 1920's-Vienna to 1999-New York City? Total absurdity, when we realize that Tom Cruise's character, Bill ""I'm-A-Doctor"" Harford, is actually amazed that his wife once had a sexual fantasy involving a Naval officer. The whole ludicrous situation is laid out in a ludicrous scene, in which we also learn that Nicole Kidman is so unsatisfied as a wife that a mere GLANCE from the Navy guy would've caused her to abandon her husband and young daughter. I don't know any women who would behave in such a way. (I've only read them in Freud.)This all drives poor Dr. Harford quite mad (dear God, perhaps she even had sexual partners BEFORE I EVEN MET HER!), and he hits the street (an unrecognizable New York City -- the movie was filmed, obviously, in London), looking for a good time. Or something. I guess the idea here is revenge against his wife's dirty, dirty thoughts. Or something. Without belaboring the plot-points, let's just say that he ends up visiting hookers, nubile daughters of haberdashers, among others, but Kubrick doesn't permit our hero(TOM CRUISE, okay?) to actually score. But then, the whole silly thing is unlikely in the first place. Eventually the movie gets to its centerpiece: a campy orgy straight out of a De Sade spoof, with waving incense, chants, creepy electro-organ music, and hundreds of interchangeable naked girls wearing only high-heels and really cool Venetian masks. We are, I believe, meant to nod wisely at Kubrick's ""commentary"" concerning the impersonality of sex outside the sacred marriage bond. *Eyes Wide Shut*, in others words, is a movie made by a happily married man of 4 decades.By the time we get to the orgy, the bored cinephile's only interest is considering how much better Fellini would've done this sort of thing. After all, Fellini, though sloppy, was a true surrealist . . . and along those lines, Bunuel would've made a sheer masterpiece of this movie. But Kubrick was inspired, so many years ago, by the dour Antonioni: they each certainly had their share of bourgeois baggage to bring to their work. The point being, this is a movie without any heat, without any fun. The focus is on the backlash of erotic freedom, with the supposed irony of our hero's not being able to actually enjoy any of that freedom during the course of the film. Some here have found this to be profound, and perhaps it would've seemed more profound to me if this film had been a period piece set in, say, the 1800's -- a time in which sexual autonomy was strictly a deeply private idea to be smothered in guilt and the flames of Hell. But in 1999's New York, it's a weird and ultimately pointless anachronism. And sadly it's not even redeemed with the usual photographic brilliance one expects from Kubrick: the picture is grainy, gritty, and even glaring (you keep having this urge to turn down either your color or the contrast on your TV set), overly schematic in terms of ""color-coding"" (blue lighting indicates chasteness; red lighting indicates erotic danger). Indeed, the whole movie is full of shallow symbols a la the lighting -- the perfect movie, in other words, for film grads writing their thesis. What a bore.I'll refrain from adding in-depth to the countless comments about the inanity of the dialogue and the tepidness of the performances. I'll only say this much: not much of a surprise here, given the director's track record with bad ""star"" performances in favor of quirky minor players who enliven things a bit in his movies. Needless to say, these bit parts by talented character actors add just about the only enjoyable elements to a sad last at-bat from Stanley Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut
201,cbnewham,A weak film that pretends to be more than it really is,2,28 September 2020,"I have been meaning to see this film, the final Kubrick film, for 20 years. I have now, and what a disappointment.The film tries to appear clever and highbrow, but even the merest examination shows what a hollow and miserable thing it is. The Cruise and Kidman characters seem to have led a very sheltered existence given their comments about sex. Sure, there is a lot of imagery, but it doesn't really further the weak commentary in the script about the human condition.But there we have it - perhaps this says more about Kubrick than it does about the characters in the film.Altogether a very boring plot that has almost nothing to say. Two stars for getting Cruise and Kidman to agree to appear in this.",Eyes Wide Shut
202,elcopy,Kubrick seemed ready to pass the torch to new geniuses.,6,19 July 1999,"Great storytelling. Poor casting judgment. That's how you can resume Kubrick's last masterpiece.Unlike film directors from the school of Lucas, Kubrick treats his audience as intelligent human beings. This is actually a filmmaker who wants you to think when watching his film and not just sit there like an idiot, killing time in a dark room for a couple of hours. He doesn't tell you everything that's going on in the story so you have to figure it out for yourself. Besides, the story is carried from the point of view of one person, and that person has to figure out things just like us.There are some flaws in the movie that stand out too much to be ignored.Especially in the casting. Tom Cruise, a mediocre actor who happens to work with wonderful people, is never believable as his character. Neither's Nicole Kidman by the way. A street hooker that looks like a model from Vogue Magazine disconnects you from a sense of reality, as well as the minorityless New York Streets. Fortunately this movie will survive the test of time and hopefully in the future the presence of Cruise won't be so distracting from the whole thing.The story, which is more teasing than sexual, and basically about a confused guy who ends up crashing into a party he wasn't invited. Some supposedly graphic scenes, that must be in the movie to deliver the story, are ruined with computer imaginery. Yet, none of these are enough reasons to discard this movie.

In my opinion Kubricks 2001, is understandable in comparison. Now I'm giving this movie a 7/10 because it's a Kubrick film, and I admit that I probably missed the point. Nverteless the acting was great and I liked the character development in the film. The exact meaning of the characters experiences I did NOT get at all. But I'm sure one day I'll see the film again and say: ""aha, now I get it"". that's how 2001 was for me, and I doubt this will be an exception.A little warning for you who are afraid of graphic films. There is a LOT of nudity in this film. Almost to the point of being humorously weird I thought. The main subject of this film is SEX. And for some scenes that's about it. Never before have I seen a film with so much sex, orgy's, full and partial nudity. Why this is in the film I don't know, I'll probably figure that out one day as well.I must say this is not a bad final movie for Kubricks great career.

204,chucknorrisfacts,Watch it!,10,18 December 2010,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a pretty crazy movie. I first discovered it while staying the night at a friend's house. They had already gone to bed and I was searching for something to watch on TV. I came across ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and it didn't take long for the movie to pull me in, in fact, it happened almost immediately. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but let's just say I walked in on probably the craziest part in the whole movie.Needless to say, I was intrigued. I decided that I had to rent the movie to find out what the hell happened before I started watching. I really liked it. In my opinion, it's easily Stanley Kubrick's best film. I know a lot of people may disagree with that viewpoint, but that's my opinion.People with short attention spans may not like the movie as it is what I call a slow-burner. A slow-burner is a movie that while it may take a while to build up to the climax, it's well worth it by the time it happens. Some people may consider the movie to be anti-climactic, but I don't. I think that the ending is abrupt, but still satisfying.The visuals from this movie will stay with you for a long time. I can promise this, you'll never forget the scene I came in on. You'll know it when you see it. I don't want to give away anything more than that.Do yourself a favor and check this movie out. I don't think you'll regret it!",Eyes Wide Shut
205,steven-222,"""The life of the heterosexual is a SICK and BORING life!""",5,30 September 2011,"Some observations:1) As the movie starts, with that nonstop jazz waltz by Shostakovich playing and the New York Xmas party at an elegant townhouse with everyone in gowns and tuxes, and then, OMG—is Sydney Pollack in this movie?—I had to wonder if I was watching a parody of all those Woody Allen Manhattan melodramas. Only much funnier.2) Directed by Kubrick and co-written by Fredric Raphael...who both had such seminal successes in the 1960s...this movie strikes me as the very last gasp of 1960s Eurotrash. The nudity + Venetian masks, opulent houses and clothes, the terrible acting...if only it were badly subtitled and starred Alain Delon instead of Tom Cruise, this could be a lost ""masterpiece"" by some forgotten Italian hack-director. (Except the 1960s Italian version would have been a lot more violent, bloody, and...fun!)Alas, Kubrick made this movie exactly 30 years too late. I think maybe there should be a rule that 70-year-old filmmakers should NOT try to make ""erotic"" thrillers. The result is inevitably creepy, and not in a good way.3) As the ""story"" progresses, with poor Tom unable to get laid and witnessing one buzz-killing scene after another, I couldn't help but think of that classic line by Edith Massey in Female Trouble, hysterically warning her son away from the straight world: ""The life of the heterosexual is a SICK and BORING life!"" Kubrick seems to have made this exercise to illustrate just that point.4) Rich weirdos having a sex orgy-cum-black mass at a mansion in the middle of nowhere is a venerable Eurotrash cliché, but I think Roman Polanski had the last word on this particular motif in The Ninth Gate, also released in 1999, and an infinitely sexier, more sinister movie. If only Polanksi had made Eyes Wide Shut...sigh...5) Was this Kubrick's pro-monogamy, post-AIDS rebuttal of Rocky Horror Picture Show? Tom & Nicole as Brad & Janet, tempted to stray from their marriage vows. But here, they don't. ""Don't Dream It, Be It"" is replaced by ""Think About It Constantly, Don't Dare Do Anything (You'll Die!)""...and of course, rich weirdos in costumes being kinky in a mansion in the middle of nowhere.6) Why the Xmas trees everywhere? (Except of course at the mansion of the human-sacrificing Satan worshippers.) Because this is a Christian movie, duh!7) Death looms over every scene of Tom seeking to get laid outside his marriage. At the first party, the naked woman (tempation) almost dies of an OD. When his patient's daughter kisses Tom, her dead father is right there in the room. The hooker Tom almost sleeps with (saved by a phone call from his wife) turns out to have tested HIV-positive; that was a close call! And of course, there is a human sacrifice at the masked ball; another close call, as it could have been Tom. At the end (while Xmas-shopping, and in the presence of their daughter) the two procreators face up to the inevitability of having sexual fantasies, but renew their ""covenant"" to ""f"" only each other.8) Thus, Kubrick's final message to mankind: sex outside procreative monogamy = death.And here are all these ""reviewers"" rattling on about how transgressive this movie is, when it could hardly be more conservative. Titillating, yes, but only so as to show a man walking through the dangerous fire of temptation and coming out the other side.",Eyes Wide Shut

The setting is a big tease by itself, as the audience, who may identify themselves with pedestrian bourgeois Cruise, can only imagine if the story could be real or not. The empty film with the gorgeous outlook may be appropriate to conclude Kubrick's career, as he had perfected most of his works with various materials in a randomly wide range, which are sometimes meaningful and sometimes not.Technical note: The editor used a lot of long cross-dissolves, which are strongly annoying.

207,murtaza_mma,"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Kubrick's swan song, and arguably his greatest",10,8 December 2009,"Stanley Kubrick is unarguably Anglo-American cinema's most potent reply to the 'Fellinis', the 'Bunuels', the 'Bergmans', the 'Kurosawas', the 'Rays', and the 'Tarkovskys' of the world. Ubiquitously known for his inexorable yearning for perfection and uncanny innovation, Kubrick had managed to hold millions of viewers worldwide in a transfixion through his brilliant works for well over four decades. Regarded by Kubrick as his very best, Eyes Wide Shut is incredibly brilliant and sui generis. It's an elixir for the sore eyes; a panacea for the perturbed souls; a surreally psychedelic pleasure. Like most of his avant-garde works, Eyes Wide Shut is open to speculation and can be interpreted in a number of ways. Despite being rife with nudity, Eyes Wide Shut cannot be stigmatized or snubbed on the account of eroticism. On the contrary, it is aesthetic as well as thought-provoking. The movie incredibly manages to have a tremendous impact on the intellect as well as the viscera, asking incessant questions of the viewer while simultaneously haunting his thoughts and refining his imagination. The story revolves around a New York based doctor whose wife's confession of ephemeral infidelity perplexes him. Consequently, his chagrin and dudgeon drives him into a night of debauchery where he gets a lesson on sexual and moral enlightenment, which inexplicably saves him from an incipient turmoil. The cinematography is awe-inspiring to say the least and is well complemented by the plaintively haunting background score. The orgy scene, which is treated with contempt by many, is undoubtedly one of the most vivid scenes ever visualized or choreographed in the history of cinema. In fact, it is Kubrick's brilliant showmanship that makes it so very special. Tom Cruise is absolutely brilliant and convincing in the challenging portrayal of Dr. Harford and succeeds in having an enormous impact on the viewers and also manages to evoke their empathy. The nocturnal odyssey being rife with debauchery and decadence, ironically serves as a lesson of moral reformation. Nicole Kidman is ravishingly scintillating in her portrayal. The couple has incredibly managed to mirror their real life chemistry and tension on screen. The movie is a quintessence of cinematic excellence and can only be relished by discarding bigotry, conservatism and prejudice. The movie is a delectable feast and a must watch for patient viewers and lovers of avant-garde cinema. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",Eyes Wide Shut
208,Blade_Le_Flambeur,"Glorious and stunning, Kubrick's final film is his best",10,18 July 2004,"Stanley Kubrick is the type of director that is beloved by many, and his films have earned a high place in cinematic history ('Dr. Strangelove, '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Full Metal Jacket'). He is a director who creates and creates, which is interesting, because most of his films are based on published pieces of literature. He has gone from genres such as crime ('Killer's Kiss', 'The Killing') to war ('Paths of Glory', 'Full Metal Jacket') to satire ('Dr. Strangelove', 'Barry Lyndon), and even more. He envokes a rare visual beauty within his films, and he creates perfection in every frame. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is no exception.Here we have such mainstream actors as Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, Alan Cumming, and even Leelee Sobieski. But Kubrick doesn't fail them, and they don't fail Kubrick. Each actor listed, and more (Todd Field, Vanessa Shaw) give powerful performances. Tom Cruise, who many slam for being such a mainstream actors, proves his ability to act here. Nicole Kidman, who also is a mainstream actress, though more praised in the film world, also gives a genuine performance. We have caricatures here: the wealthy and kind doctor (Tom Cruise), the attractive wife (Nicole Kidman), the wealthy and corrupt friend (Sydney Pollack), and the hooker with a heart of gold (Vanessa Shaw). These people feel real. They're dialogue is not especially extremely quote- able, but they sound like human beings, saying stupid things or not. The film is calculated, no doubt, but in a way that gives us what is intended. Tom Cruise is Dr. Bill Harford, who resorts to his profession as a doctor and his kindness as an escape, while walking around New York at night after his wife's stoned confession about near- infidelity. He is jealous, even though he says he's not ""the jealous type"". He lies to her, but she saves him nonetheless. Through his experiences, he understands more and more about things he didn't want to know about. Is Tom Cruise good? No doubt. Even though I prefer him in his other 1999 feature, 'Magnolia', he still gives a good performance as the kind- hearted but somewhat ignorant doctor. You can feel his anguish, and his confusion. Life was going perfect for him, he had a good time with his rich friend, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), and he came home fine. He is thrown awry by the confession of his wife (Nicole Kidman), because he lives in the notion that she would never lie to him, and he would never lie to her. She quips to him, ""You are AWFULLY sure of yourself!"" and he replies with ""No! I'm sure of you!"". She proceeds into a laughing fit then proceeds to tell him about her near infidelity. Nicole Kidman, an actress I feel that seems to lack a passion for performing, uses her cold air here perfectly. On the surface, she is a kind, gentle, loving woman but underneath she is filled with angst. Sydney Pollack as Victor Ziegler gives the audience the best performance of the film. He is commanding, he is greedy and selfish, but he gets what he wants. In one scene by a pool table, he talks to Bill about an incident both were involved in, and you can feel the corruption. The supporting cast does the job as well. Todd Field plays Nick, a pianist who helps Bill when he shouldn't, and a somewhat sleazy character. Vanessa Shaw is sexy as the prostitute, and she plays it correctly. And last, but not least, Alan Cumming is hysterical as the gay receptionist who helps Bill with some information about Nick. In some cases, the lead actors in Kubrick's films over- shadow the rest of the cast (see 'A Clockwork Orange'), but here he manages to balance everyone out. And it works.Say what you will about the slow pacing of Kubrick's film, but he has a fantastic visual eye. The cinematography by Larry Smith is fantastic, giving the film a dream like quality. The colors are lush and poetic, and give the film the perfect tone. The haunting musical score by Jocelyn Cook is also fantastic, especially the chilling simple- noted piano music. The film editing by Nigel Galt gives the film the right pace, making it not too fast paced, but not too slow either. There is no awkward editing, the film feels smooth and just right. While I've always thought Kubrick is more talented at directing than he he is at writing, his and Frederic Raphael's screenplay is excellent. The dialog, while it may at times sound contrived and even silly, is perfect because the characters feel genuine. Bill is kind- hearted, but not ready for the tough part of the world. Alice is honest, but loves her husband and child. Victor is greedy and morally shakey, but he is an effective man who gets what he wants out of life and has no remorse. The story is an interesting one, and it is an important examination of sex in people's lives. Detractors who say the film is ""about nothing but sex"" are missing the point completely. It is about human interaction, which at times, is sex, but also about themes such as love, friendship, trust, honesty, and more.And boy, is Kubrick a talented director. He brings everything together, he has directed the actors perfectly and has woven a masterful tale. The orgy scene is one of the most brilliant and visually stunning films in cinematic history, as well as one of the most bizarre. The momentum of the film builds up, and never lets down as characters have unexpected confrontations. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is dramatic, but not overly dramatic, and emphasis is put in exactly the right places. 'Eyes Wide Shut' opened in the summer of 1999, amongst many detractors. Not only was it seen by Stanley Kubrick fans, but also fans of mainstream stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. For me, it is the masters's best work, and a representation of the brillaince of cinema. It is quite possibly, the greatest film ever made. So turn off your expectations, and ignore the terrible reviews, and watch 'Eyes Wide Shut'. You won't forget it.",Eyes Wide Shut
209,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Better than I hoped...,8,21 April 2013,"A really good film, enhancing Stanley Kubrick's reputation as a great director. I'm a big fan of Kubrick's work from 1971 onwards but wasn't expecting this film to be very good. Fortunately I was wrong.The Cruise/Kidman billing put me off right from the start, perhaps suggesting a rather lame, overly stylized level of production, and the film's length at over two-and-a-half hours also put me off, but for all that, it turned out to be an engrossing and entertaining film.If you're not into full frontal nudity and orgies you're not going to be impressed by this particular method of jolting your attention and setting the scene for the thriller/mystery aspect of the film, which doesn't quite pull it off in terms of tension. I was on the edge of my seat at one point, half-anticipating a Hitchcock thriller with a tense and justifiable ending, but unfortunately the film decided to play it safe, re-focusing on the lust/sexual/marriage aspects of the film instead of giving satisfaction.The story refocuses on Kubrick's message about potential deceit and who is betraying who, whether the couple are justified in feeling the way they do and how we ourselves would react under such tempting circumstances. Cruise's acting is good, but the transition his character made from being a faithful husband, with doubts about his wife's fidelity, into a man prepared to go to any lengths to satisfy his curiosity, wasn't quite believable.For all that, I really enjoyed the movie, continuing Kubrick's great run of form since A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket. Overall a worthy addition to the SK legacy.The ending was a little too convenient for me, but it did pose a very interesting question. Are we faithful to our partners because we love them, or because of obstacles that prevent us from being unfaithful?",Eyes Wide Shut
210,Dar Star,Classic Kubrick,9,29 March 2000,"Eyes Wide Shut is classic Kubrick.  If you don't get Kubrick, you'll hate it, if you do get Kubrick you'll like it.  It's as simple as that.  The plot is incidental to the journey he takes you on within your own psyche (this time exploring the nature of sexual attraction).  Tom and Nicole do a fine job, the cinematography is terrific, and the atmosphere of the film is all-enveloping.  A cinematic treat which I rate an 8 out of 10 stars ********",Eyes Wide Shut

I think it wasn't boring at all, maybe some people can say that it was because this movie was very long without many naked bodies. In fact I think the movie was very difficult to follow so it made me pay attention to it every minute. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise were excellent as a couple, they could act very well and understandable. Nicole Kidman shows that she is a great actress, she can perform any roles she wants to. She is excellent. Tom Cruise is a great actor as well, he demonstrated that he could act in a thriller-drama movie. It was very well directed by Stanley Kubrick who died four days after filming it. He showed most of his old films in this movie. It has a lot of meanings, maybe he can knew that it was going to be his last movie, so I think this is his best masterpiece. This it not boring, it has an interesting plot in which I got astounded every minute, from the beginning to the end.",Eyes Wide Shut
212,IrisNo11,"Keep Your Eyes Wide Open And Witness the Haunting, Exotic Images of Kubrick's Final Masterpiece",10,25 May 2000,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the final masterpiece by the great Stanley Kubrick!  His many films bring unforgettable, strange and twisted images that will leave his audience spellbound and in deep thought!  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is one of them many films that could never be left out!  Stanley Kubrick's final work is a stunning film, starring Tom Cruise and wife, Nicole Kidman, as a wealthy NYC husband and wife.  Once Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) confesses she had a fling with another man, her husband, Dr. William Hartford (Tom Cruise), is left in deep thought and soon goes on a wild journey of moral discovery and mystery after attending a secret erotic masquerade filled with sexual fantasies and activities.  Yet after attending the masquerade, he soon finds out that attending the private party threatens not only himself, but everything he loves as well!!!I was captivated by the plot, and when I saw this movie, it wasn't what I expected it to be!  It's better than I ever imagined!  Yet also hard to keep up with if you take your eyes off of the screen.  So, keep your eyes wide open when watching Stanley Kubrick's final erotic masterpiece....but keep your children's eyes shut tightly!!! :)  This is one film you DO NOT want to miss seeing!!!!",Eyes Wide Shut
213,Don-102,1999: A Sex Odyssey,10,20 July 1999,"As long as you don't buy into the hype that surrounds pictures like EYES WIDE SHUT, you can watch without prejudice and assess what you are seeing more precisely.  Let me say that Stanley Kubrick's final film is a psychological and visual masterpiece.  The ridiculous media hype generated by the famed director's meticulous filmmaking methods and the film's allegedly ""pornographic"" style with stars such as Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman is flat out sad.  It is an extremely GOOD film with some truly GREAT moments.  Kubrick's swan song is his best work since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in 1971.Short-attention span viewers beware:  Stay Away!  Go see ARLINGTON ROAD if you want generic, meaningless entertainment.  Smart, discerning moviegoers with an eye for art and unique cinema must, and probably will, see EYES WIDE SHUT.  This is an engaging and excrutiatingly candid look at sexual obsession and jealousy within a man's mind and heart.  Sex is what human beings, specifically males, think of most.  What an exploration into a few days in the life of a jealous husband who falls into some strange and disturbing sexual situations.Is the film soft-core porn?  Absolutely not.  The sex scenes are very mild in accordance to what has been reported through both rumors and initial reviews.  Is the film about sex and only sex?  In a way, yes.  Sex involves passion and love, jealousy, and danger.  These 4 elements are tied together with such disturbing subtlety, quite frankly I was spellbound.  Sex also involves temptation and aftermath, which is also pertinent to the rather linear story.  Kubrick and company do not go over the top.  They merely present to us a dangerous nightmare maybe not entirely unlike the Kidman character's sexual dream and revelation.EYES WIDE SHUT is long, but seems bitterly quick and I couldn't help but shake my head in amazement at the people who walked out on such a superlative piece of work.  This is not a commercial Cruise-Kidman film (thankfully).  Marketing has made it appear to be one.  It is a labor of love that will always be looked at through a microscope.The performances are good and I think Kidman may be underused here.  There are some brief moments when the Cruise character reminds you of ""Mitch McDeere"" of THE FIRM  and will figure it all out, but Kubrick fans will know better.  The sinister two-note piano key played throughout the movie goes so well within the foreign New York atmosphere (it was all shot in England) and so many of the great director's trademarks emerge (a bathroom scene, steadicam shots, extraordinary set decoration, gloomy lighting).  The title is a nifty way of naming a film the TV networks would call ""The Misadventures of Dr. Bill"".  They truly are misadventures, but a motive is there.Do yourself a favor and see Stanley Kubrick's farewell stamp to his legendary career.  It is by all means a thriller, with dark thoughts, sexual double-crossing, kinky parties, and all that Kubrickian stuff that never fails to leave you in awe.RATING: ****",Eyes Wide Shut

215,ween-3,You just know that Stanley didn't want to go out on THIS note,5,7 August 1999,"As a dyed-in-the-wool Kubrick fan, I'm aware that the closest Kubrick ever came to depicting sex was the docking sequence in ""2001"" but I bought into the hype and figured that if Stanley was going S&M and Tom and Nicole were along for the ride this was going to be AN EVENT. What I got instead was 45 minutes of Kabuki theatre accompanied by Gregorian chants and a piano that was missing 87 keys, and another 2 1/2 hours of Stan's Greatest Hits. There were pieces of ""Clockwork"", ""2001"" and ""Full Metal"" sprinkled liberally throughout the proceedings in the form of camerawork and pacing. Probably nothing wrong with this movie that a good hedge trimmer couldn't cure. This puppy D--R--A--G--S! Unfortunately, some impressive acting by Nicole Kidman and a great little bit by Alan Cumming gets lost in this ponderous opus. A miscast Cruise and a script that ostensibly is about obsession, dreams and reality never gets the viewer to a clearer understanding of how they are connected. One can sift through some of the more obvious nonsense and sort of see where Kubrick wanted to go, but, like riding the Long Island Railroad, it's just a long, hard way to get there. Considering the body of work that Kubrick left behind, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" has to rank as a disappointment. We've lost one of the great American originals, a truly visionary director, and it's seems a shame that his swan song should be one of his lesser efforts.",Eyes Wide Shut
216,hippiedj,Arthouse T & A,4,18 May 2001,"Think about this: if you didn't know this was directed by Stanley Kubrick or told someone else directed it, would you have liked it?  I've seen too many cases of kiss-butt for this film than any other in recent history.  Sort of like the folks who say they like Shakespeare just to be considered smart and full of culture.  You can argue the film is a deep study of ""human covenants,"" relationships, trust, vulnerability....but take away many of the gratuitous nude shots and the stars ""CRUISE     KIDMAN      KUBRICK"" (jeez, I expected a little ""tm"" trademark next to each name), and you will see there's not much left.  Just like some positive reviews of the film Striptease claim that film was a ""clever comment"" blah blah were unfounded, considering if you put lesser known stars in that one you'd have a late-night T & A flick like the ones shown weekends after midnight on the USA cable network.I knew Eyes Wide Shut was going to be a bit one-sided on the nudity element once I saw that the very first shot was Nicole Kidman dropping her dress. There seemed to be several scenes like this where she is posed naked, getting undressed, putting on a bra, standing in front of a mirror, etc. and they have nothing whatsoever to do with the story.  Interesting how we never saw multiple scenes of Cruise doing the same kind of thing, naked and pulling underwear on or off--guess the heterosexual males in the audience would complain about that.More chances to see Kidman naked are in Cruise's ""tormented"" visions of her and another man (which seem to pop up in the story whenever a certain amount of time has passed in which no breasts are seen, kind of convenient), and these ""visions"" fail to come across as tormenting because they are too forced and bathed in blue hue, giving them a feel of something out of a direct-to-video ""erotic thriller"" with Shannon Tweed and Andrew Stevens.All these problems are made even more messy by the weak material Kidman had to work with when she was given the task of having to laugh in her sleep, then deliver a dialogue about her dream.  Even her argument with Cruise about him flirting at the party seemed a confusing one considering the excuse to not sleep with the man she was dancing with was ""I'm married..."" (and she never admitted she had the opportunity) an excuse she wouldn't accept from her husband when he said that's why he didn't have sex with two models.  The mysterious gathering at the mansion?  Seemed like a lot of hooplah just for guys to get to have sex with hookers.  Okay, if that's what was happening.  I admit to attending some interesting ""events"" in my life and sex was never made THAT symbolic--I found the Howard Stern mentality rather annoying that the women at the mansion looked like they were made from the same mold, were eager to paw and touch each other and were all accessibly naked while (and I assume the cloaked figures WERE men) 98% of the guys were covered head to toe.  Many people don't realize that for the U.S. release many scenes of copulation were blocked by digital images of people!I was very suspicious of the intended audience as well by the fact that if women in the film are willing to participate in sex with each other and do this naturally, why then was the one male gay character (the hotel desk clerk) portrayed as a total prissy stereotype?  I can't believe we've come this far to keeping gay male characters at a Jerry Springer-show level. Again, this is another way to make the straight men watching the film feel secure.  Hey folks, I have no problem with nudity and sexual oriented films, but when the a parade of breasts is really not connected with the story, I get the feeling of a sham going on.This could have turned out differently...but after all the talk and secrecy during its filming and the unbelievable length of time it took to make it, Eyes Wide Shut was a hyped event.  Its importance as a film is extremely overrated, just because Kubrick is connected with it doesn't mean it's such relevant filmmaking.  I remember hearing how Last Tango In Paris was considered to be such an important film and I just sat there thinking Bertolucci was joking when he made that!  Jean-Luc Godard did much the same thing:  get naked women to spout philosophical lines and for some reason you have high art.Check some of the interesting foreign/art films I've reviewed, and you'll see I'm not damning ""art"" cinema at all. But I know a basic nudie film guised as legitimate cinema, and Eyes Wide Shut was only a glossy example of just that.",Eyes Wide Shut
217,parameswaranrajendran,An indeed masterpiece,8,25 February 2018,"The movie that I tried to ignore for past 4 years since researching about the secret society and conspiracy theories. Finally today is the day to talk about this film. Stanley Kubrick exposed one of the oldest secret in this world through dream & mystery genre. I like the one dialogue said by Tom Cruise - What kind of fu**ing charade is that taking lives of people. Stanley significantly hints those celebrities that died and will die in future too. Here are some eye-opening facts about Eyes Wide Shut1. The film is based on novella Traumnovelle (Dream Story) which was published in 1926.2. The Warner Bros. Pictures pushed Kubrick to cast A-list names.3. Kubrick liked the idea of casting a real-life married couple in the film, and originally considered Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger. Eventually, he went with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who were married from 1990 to 2001.4. Though the film is set in New York, it was filmed in London.5. The movie is the Guiness World Record Holder for the longest constant movie shoot with a total of 400 days. Cruise and Kidman only committed to six months of filming. The extended shoot delayed work for Mission: Impossible II. Tom didn't seem to mind though as he said - we knew from the beginning the level of commitment needed.6. Kubrick temporarily banned Cruise from the set during shoot Kidman's sex scene with another man, which motivates the rest of the film's plot. They spent 6 days to filming the one-minute scene (wtf Kubrick).7. Six days for a one-minute scene is nothing compared to the time Kubrick had Cruise do 95 takes of one simple action: walking through a door. 8. Kubrick has a cameo in the movie which can be seen sitting in a booth at the Sonata Café.9. Kubrick passed away less than a week after showing the studio what would be the final cut of the film to Warner Bros. (not surprise for those revealing secret society)10. Eyes Wide Shut came out a full 12 years after Kubrick's previous film 1987's Full Metal Jacket.11. Kubrick's only film to earned $30,196,742 during its first week in release.12. One year after the film's release, Cruise admitted that he ""didn't like playing Dr. Bill. I didn't like him. It was unpleasant. But I would have absolutely kicked myself if I hadn't done this.",Eyes Wide Shut
218,Ron Plasma,It came. We saw. But did it conquer?,8,25 October 1999,"There is no doubt in my mind that Eyes Wide Shut is a master work.  It's a feel isn't it?  Somehow you can sense that Nicole Kidman, a very beautiful woman, has been coached into the role of - a very beautiful woman.  But it's not the same beautiful woman.  What a clever trick!  The New York streets, (put together in Pinewood), are so New York that you expect Gene Kelly to splash about in their puddles.  Then there is the set that is a large number of the most perfect naked female bodies.  Phew!  That must have been CGI. It would upset the natural balance of the world if all that flawless flesh gathered in one room.  Omitting to do the faces was just a tease.  Oh, yeah.And Tom Cruise was OK.  So.  Masterpiece?  Maybe.  It works for me.",Eyes Wide Shut
219,Captain Ed,A yawner,6,20 October 2000,"There's nothing terribly objectionable about EWS, except that it takes almost three hours out of your life and returns nothing.  Two words come to mind after two viewings: pointless and boring.Tom Cruise was pretty good in this role, but it didn't seem like much of a stretch for him.  He's playing an Everyman type.  Nicole Kidman, though, was terrible, and I'm beginning to doubt if she has any talent at all.  The overly long dancing scene featured her wildly overacting in Drunk Mode. (The actor she was paired up with was no great shakes either; talk about a lack of chemistry.)  The toke-up scene a few minutes later was even worse. Did Kubrick *require* actors to talk veeeerrrryyy ssslllooowwwlllyyy in a monotone when delivering lines?  The ""You men have no idea"" line took about thirty seconds of screen time, and reminded me of the ""I AM in a world of s**t"" line from Full Metal Jacket.  Kidman wasn't the only one saddled with this direction, which made the movie seem even more ponderous and self-important.**Some SPOILERS**The story line was unimpressive at best, and seemed stolen from the plots of a hundred soft-core semi-porn films.  Everything in it was a cheat.  Talk about a lack of commitment; no one ever follows through on anything.  Cruise picks up a hooker and doesn't do anything with her.  He goes to a sex party and avoids having sex, but he thinks about it a lot.  Even the crucial motivating factor for Cruise's character is nothing -- his wife was attracted to another man the previous year.  Nothing ever happened between the two of them, but supposedly it rocks Cruise's world. 
Two scenes at the end really spell it out better than anything else.  While you're led to believe that there's a vast conspiracy, Sidney Pollack tells Cruise it was all just a fantasy.  The key visual clue which tells you it may not be is immediately revealed, eliminating all suspense in the final climactic return home for Cruise.  You see the clue, completely aware of what it means, then have to sit through two or three minutes of Cruise walking through the house before he sees it himself.Let's not forget the extremely annoying toy-piano score.  It consists of someone using a single finger to hit the same seven-note run, over and over again throughout the movie.  Ugh.  It's supposed to indicate suspense, but all it does is set your teeth on edge.I know Kubrick is a god to some people, but this movie is NOTHING like 2001 or A Clockwork Orange, or even the first half of Full Metal Jacket.  It's a waste of money, time, and talent.  If it looks appealing to you, I'd suggest waiting until it's on the movie channels.  Don't waste any more money on it.",Eyes Wide Shut
220,Captain Ed,One final comment ...,6,24 October 2000,"One thing I forgot to add in my earlier post is a response to the many reviewers who advise four or five viewings to understand what Kubrick is trying to say.  This is an incredibly arrogant comment and shouldn't go unchallenged.First, as an avid movie-goer, I well understand that repeated viewings of a film will sometimes give different perspectives and meanings.  Cool Hand Luke is one such film, Edward Scissorhands another, On the Waterfront, Being There, and many, many others.  However, if a director makes his film SO obtuse that it takes more than two viewings to understand it (really, more than one), then the film fails.  The point of art is to communicate, not to needlessly play mind games.Second, I *did* get the message that Kubrick intended on sending, and I still feel the movie was pointless and boring.  That's due to some very lackluster directing and below-par acting, especially by Nicole Kidman. Having interminable long shots of empty rooms and hallways may be a hallmark of Kubrick's (I'd disagree with that), but if so, it doesn't work.  It drags the pace of the film down to a crawl.  So does Kubrick's idea of delivering 'important' dialogue: stretching the words out needlessly in a monotone. Small wonder this film came in at 2:45.  Watch The Green Mile, another multi-layered movie, and see how fast the three-hour runtime passes. 
I understand that some reviewers have an emotional attachment to Kubrick, and I also really enjoyed other of his works.  Take another viewing of Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange.  Sure, you can get different subtleties and symbolisms on multiple viewings, but the main themes are communicated clearly  on the first viewing.  Both movies also were well-paced, included excellent acting, and had much more interesting (and real) conflicts, taking real chances with the material, not the half-baked and phony issues which form the crux of this movie.  In this case, sadly, the Emperor has no clothes.",Eyes Wide Shut
221,DonaldDooD,"Not Erotic, Not Inditing, Not Realistic - Pointless",2,27 July 2014,"I think Andrew Yorkshades's review is the perfect smackdown for this overrated swan song. I feel I need to find this man, and smoke some cigars as we reminiscence on our three hour torture.The one point I'd like to add - the relationship in this film has no bearing to real life. For a final time, Kubrick forces his characters into such polarized roles to prove a point, they cease to be characters. 99.9% of women would not react to Cruise's revelation as Kidman does. No woman would desperately want to bang you shortly after you told them of your attempted infidelity. There'd be a long healing phase, if the divorce papers aren't delivered! The fact she thinks sex will solve their problems shows either the character's and/or the director's immaturity. Either way, why should we care? The relationship is banal, even in its flaws.Stanley Kubrick is a cinematic God - blindly worshiped and unquestionable. One must wonder what he could have made for his fans to call him out. People can interpret this film a million ways - some even say it has clues on the Illuminati. For me, it was a boring, unrealistic, pretentious waste of time.",Eyes Wide Shut
222,ebert_jr,Complex psychosexual drama a la Kubrik,8,18 July 1999,"This film is definitely worth a look and from a stylistic standpoint is trademark Kubrik.  However, I doubt this film will be viewed as another Kubrik masterpiece or some cult film.  For all its style I don't think it has the substance for that.  On the other hand, this film is so lavishly filmed that it would be a shame to simply try to rate it on a basic star or number scale.In any case, this was a hard movie for me to review.  It's very well done; the acting, the cinematography, the direction, the filming locations, the extravagant architecture, the lighting, the mood, the list goes on and on. However, I think the plot is to some degree open to interpretation.Basically the story depicts infidelity experienced within the context of dreams, or perhaps drug induced hallucinations, which allow the characters to walk a line between fantasy and reality. What we the viewer are seeing in the majority of the film, except for the beginning and ending, aren't happening in reality.  Instead, it's the sexual fantasy induced by the two getting high which acts as sort of a catalyst.  This dream or nightmare like state is stylistically and conceptually reminiscent of the eerie scene in ""The Shining"" where Jack Torrance, played by Jack Nicholson, is alone in the bar and later has visions of murder.For all its media hype, the nudity is just, well, just really no big deal. I don't know how much editing was done to obstruct some of the scenes, but after viewing it I'm certain it was probably a knee jerk reaction by the part of the movie rating system folks.",Eyes Wide Shut
223,n-mo,An excellent drunken date after-party,5,7 October 2007,"Eyes Wide Shut is a bad movie, but not in the sense that you couldn't enjoy it in a kind of mystery science theater setting. I asked my buddy what on Earth had possessed him to buy this DVD, and he responded that his (now ex-)girlfriend had seen it in the store and that she had been curious to watch it. I responded that ""this DOES seem like a Walter and Fiona (names changed to protect the innocent) movie,"" especially considering that girl was a mental headcase. (In fact, according to Walter, the conversation that punctuated a wildly funny scene of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman toking it up and fondling each other rather resembled his conversations with Fiona.)And that's just the thing about this type of film: if anyone actually thought this was amazing, he would probably not be the kind of person you would want to meet. But the sort of people who THINK they should like this belong to the bored, bland, postmodern American bourgeoisie so easily duped into believing that to watch decadent pictures set against beautiful Italianate and beaux-arts architecture and sprinkled with profanity will bring enlightenment and sophistication. There are few things more hilarious or entertaining than to watch American yuppies ape this shallow conception of European culture.To be sure, Eyes Wide Shut is stunningly filmed, though it was difficult for me to place the location at first. I was not surprised to learn subsequently that Stanley Kubrick filmed this on sets rather than the actual streets of New York. The outdoor shots clearly lack the requisite atmosphere--though perhaps that was done intentionally so as to convey the ""dreamy"" sensibility so dwelt upon by fawning reviewers.Genuine or not, however, great cinematography cannot save this inordinately poorly written story. We are expected to believe that Cruise is so seriously traumatized by the discovery that his wife had fantasized about sleeping with another man (and had been relieved when he had left and removed the temptation) that he must go on a quest to understand the dark side of human sexuality. To the filmmakers' credit, they resist the temptation to make him give in to this darkness, which would have been all too easy in the era of moral nihilism. Still, this is a shaky premise at best, implying that for a physician, Cruise's character is terribly naïve about fleshly impulses.A similarly shoddy point deals with the antics of Kidman, who only dreams about what her husband witnesses. Awakened from her fit of laughter, she laments her horrifying nightmare where ""people were ****ing! And I was ****ing them! And I was making FUN of you!"" But this is so stupid as to actually be quite enjoyable: I would like to know, was she crying because she was traumatized by the thought of betraying her husband, or because she awoke from a rather pleasant dream to see her beloved at her side? Cruise and Kidman are not known for their acting abilities, but when they get the chance to ham it up at these campy moments, which are littered throughout the script, they shine, and brighten the movie just that much more. The last line was an absolute hoot, and ironically, the only logical ending to this preposterous mess.One more aspect ought to be dealt with: the nudity. Even with the U.S. edits to pass for an ""R"" rating, in my mind this still qualifies, quite easily, for NC-17. The gratuitousness of it all further dilutes and overwhelms what should have been Cruise's remarkable resistance to the subsuming forces of sexual deviance. Granting that it is difficult to depict a stylish, ritualized orgy, so central to this plot, without removing the actors' clothing, one has to question whether, if such drastic measures are necessary, there is really anything meaningful to say with this story (there is not). And the fact that this was one long in-your-face flesh fest from the opening act proves that it was meant to provoke and to ""be bad,"" which is no longer that shocking by today's lowered standards. Neither is the whole premise of an exclusive, high-society sex cult really that outlandish--most conspiracy theories are false, of course, but I've heard enough sordid tales of the American élite to know that some must be true. A well-educated urbanite like Cruise shouldn't be so shocked.Apparently this is based on a late-nineteenth century Austrian novella, which I have not read. I'm not sure how it was in its own context--perhaps it was nothing more than provocation or perversion--but this version is irredeemably marred by sloppy writing and wanton pretension to seriousness. In response to the reviewer(s) who said, ""Be prepared to think!"" I say, don't waste too many brain cells. The sheer volume of profanity, campiness and nudity precludes any possibility that a real human being could take this seriously, but watching Kubrick trip over himself to attain that end will produce no small amount of laughter. So just enjoy the guilty ride.",Eyes Wide Shut
224,Michael Kenmore,Sadly overrated tripe,4,15 March 2000,"I cannot understand for the life of me the critics heaping praises on a film called Eyes Wide Shut. I suspect the critics who gave a film the utmost positive reviews did so out of respect for its dead co-writer and director Stanley Kubrick.Eyes Wide Shut is an excruciatingly tedious and overlong movie that is more like the test of endurance than a thought-provoking philosophical movie such as Terrence Malick's flawed masterpiece The Thin Red Line. I was warned by an aunt that Eyes Wide Shut is really, in her own word, a ""sucko"". I cannot form my opinion unless I have seen the particular movie with my own eyes and judge the film based on its technical and artistic merits, among others such as logic, intelligence and content. I'm not easily offended as people might think (I consider Election one of the best movies of last year -- the sheer brilliance of the direction and screenplay blew me away -- though The Iron Giant takes the prize as my favorite movie of 1999).What irritates me most are not only the deliberately slow pace and Nicole Kidman's terrible acting (watch the long sequence in which she was spaced out and accuses her husband of cheating, then eventually confessed) but the shallow script that have no redeeming value whatsoever -- no story, no plot, nothing. The dialogues are so contrived in the first hour that I thought Kubrick and his co-writer were fantasizing what the characters' conversations and interactions are like. The fatal flaw of the movie is its glaring emotional detachment. I felt nothing for the characters, and because of that fact, I do not care about the characters at all, regardless of the situations they face.The infamous orgy sequence -- in its censored form -- was literally laughable, not because of the obviously computerized Austin Powers figures placed to avoid the dreadful NC-17 rating. There is no explanation or point about the supposed secrecy of the ritual comprising of the members wearing cloaks and masks and participating in copulation and orgy. It's an enigma why the ridiculous plot point is essential to the film -- not just the orgy but the whole idea that the secret society exists. This is simply to serve Kubrick's internal fantasies. I find it completely pointless and trivial.The only things I like about the film are the decent acting by Tom Cruise and Sidney Pollack and amazing cinematography. I thought Eyes Wide Shut is truly a mediocre film. I did not like 2001: A Space Odyssey the first time I saw it, but I appreciated that film over time. Eyes Wide Shut might as well have the same effect, but its lack of emotional distinction and absurdity (witness the weird and laughable ending) are the reasons I did not like the film.Stanley Kubrick tortured his actors and film crew during the making of Eyes Wide Shut for three years, and the final effort is not well worth it. Kubrick only wants to test the sanity of the audience sitting through the meandering and plodding two hours and 40 minutes movie.",Eyes Wide Shut
225,Det_McNulty,"Kubrick's Misunderstood Masterpiece, Constructed On A Daring and Visionary Scope Of Allegory",10,24 July 2007,"Eyes Wide Shut has become infamous for a variety of reasons, since it is the last film Stanley Kubrick ever completed, and even then some still argue that Eyes Wide Shut never got the final cut which was intended by Kubrick before he deceased. I know many people who have seen the film for the individual reason of expecting numerous levels of erotically-charged sex. Fortunately, those viewers found something which was entirely unforeseen. Many critics ""flamed"" the film upon release, yet as each year goes by Eyes Wide Shut receives increasing critical acclaim. Another controversy was the fact that the film avoided its NC-17 by censoring the notorious orgy scene, which infuriated American audiences. Much mystery and speculation surrounds the film, making everything all the more fascinating. All of this and more comes down to one thing, the fact that Kubrick was a director who changed the face of cinema, revolutionising the way a film could be composed through even its most intricate of features.It was during the production of Eyes Wide Shut -which lasted a considerable amount of time- that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were in the middle stage of their marriage. Two years after the release of the film the couple filed for divorce. In the film, they perform as a married couple who suddenly befall a dysfunctional relationship after the experience of one party. This leads the couple to become wary of one-an-other and a state of surreal desire washes over Dr. William Harford (played by Tom Cruise) who suspects his wife of adultery after she admits some dark secrets through drug-induced paranoia. After viewing Eyes Wide Shut, dissect the film's features carefully, given that you will gain much more hindsight.Ironically, it was two years subsequent to Eyes Wide Shut that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman ended their 11-year relationship. I find this interesting, since the film details topics such as martial fidelity. The narrative is composed through a somewhat fractured, distant and cold environment, epitomised by the ""vigilante quest"" that Tom Cruise's character embraces. You quickly realise that you have become a fellow protagonist in the experiences of Eyes Wide Shut, never quite knowing what is around the most ambiguous of corners. The human psyche is a difficult emotion to convey through acting, let alone directing. When released, Eyes Wide Shut was considered out-of-touch with the film-making of its time, yet I would say the film was a long way ahead of the cinema being released during the '90s. For example, the film studies many social trends buried inside the infrastructure of modernised society. A book of sociology can be seen during one scene, perfectly placed to echo Kubrick's own motifs.Arguably, Kubrick offers his fans a surreal take on a desire which affects every man and woman at some point in their life. Something that is important to be acknowledged when comprehending Eyes Wide Shut is that the majority of it was filmed on a soundstage at Pinewood Studios, London. At the time of release, critics argued that this made the film feel ""unlike New York"", yet this was an intention of the film. It echoes the surreal, dream-like state of the film, conveying the nature of a wide environment, which opens the viewer to personally analyse the features included within the gapingly open landscape. Eyes Wide Shut is a film whereby every aspect is open, such as the characters being exposed to let their own emotions walk free through an indistinct style of script-writing. The film is one which is open to viewer elucidation; even the title of the work has been debated as being the key to supporting the often cited ""dream theory"".Built on an ambiance resembling that of a period-drama, the film actually has many elements of tension, some might even go so far as to say horror. When you look at a scene, like that of the infamous masked-orgy sequence there is a real dread that starts to build up within the viewer, since the environment is superficially unnerving, bizarre and ultimately quite terrifying. The danger presented within the scene is that of an authoritative nature, which does not manipulate the audience, but instead makes them think about the people behind the masks. Yet, it is notably apparent that the sequence is not only a study of lust, covetousness suspicion and the craving for psychological stability, but it is also metaphorically speaking- a look at high-class society members at a substantial advantage in power.The copious use of the ""Kubrickian"" steadicam is that of significant poise, resonated by the trademark tracking-shots of Kubrick, which subtly scrutinise environments to a profoundly postured degree. The use of Italian architecture and sceptically shadowed lighting igniting the film's scenery and character's emotions plays an important role for much of the subtext. The abrasive, menacing score polarises the personality of the key players within the narrative, helping make everything all the more analytical in its refined style. A fundamental aspect of the feature is the allegory and allusions created by the use of paintings, sculptures, architectures and the dream-states which are personified through the screenplay. Another crucial basis of Eyes Wide Shut is the fact it is depicting barren, upper-class individuals who need to find a connotation to their lives, primarily due to the frustration that has been gained through boredom. This is all shown through the faultless acting from Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who both offer the finest performances of their careers, bursting with unquestionable flavour and chemistry. The expressionistic technicalities should be contrasted against the complex hypothesis of the film.Eyes Wide Shut deserves to be watched multiple times for the viewer to fully digest and appreciate the experience of what is an unprecedented, flawless and misjudged masterpiece which delves inside the darkest realms of human psyche. Even if you are one of the haters, I know for a fact that it is impossible for you to forget a film like Eyes Wide Shut.",Eyes Wide Shut
226,btoews,Old Fashioned and Dated,6,12 September 2020,In 2020 this movie feels really old-from a different time when the reality that the global billionaire class was basically a group of strip mining predators was still a secret to the majority of the population. Kubrick plays the politically correct card by making sure his characters are all ludicrously Waspy-I guess this was necessary for the film to be funded. Anyway I gave it a 6 because Kubrick obviously put a lot of work into the film but this is literally the most boring psychological thriller you can view.,Eyes Wide Shut
227,Tashtago,Different film after Jeffrey Epstein incident,7,11 May 2020,"I saw EWS when it came out. Kubrick is my favorite director so went in with huge expectations. The movie was a disappointment. Most of my criticism is with Nicole Kidman. She is staggeringly beautiful but I find her a poor actress. At least in EWS she is. It might be that her character is poorly written. In her two key scenes she is apparently smashed on champagne and later weirded out on dope. She doesn't seem believable in either scenario. The film itself however is definitely watchable and many of the Kubrick touches are here. Over lit scenes, long set pieces, weird characters, slowly creeping tracking shots all the trademarks of a Kubrick movie can be found. Cruise stumbles upon the uber wealthy engaging in nefarious sexual practices. There are far reaching consequences for this discovery. Pretty harrowing stuff. It seemed like fiction at the time, but with the apparent suicide of Jeffrey Epstein and his association with the rich and powerful Trump, Clinton etc. EWS may be a lot closer to a terrifying truth than we know.",Eyes Wide Shut
228,Jaime N. Christley,"Remarkable finale to a long, glorious career",9,16 July 1999,"The thing a lot of folks haven't liked about Stanley Kubrick's films is the fact that he always seemed to think the audience needed some points driven home a little harder than others.  Very little is left for debate; most everything is spelled out, pressed hard, and dwelled upon.  His critics have compared the long waits between his films to the long periods of waiting that occur while watching his films.Personally, I like the long, slow scenes in his films.  When they're filled with something:  music, movement, thought, memory of a previous scene, dread, or any other emotion, they can never really be said to be empty.  I like them because, with Kubrick, I can be sure that they're absolutely essential to his ultimate vision.  He could have put out a six-hour documentary on tissue manufacturing; at least I'll know that not one minute of screen time is wasted.""Eyes Wide Shut"" isn't as vacuous as, say, ""Barry Lyndon"" or ""The Shining."" Compared to those two, this one scoots along like a person trying to get to his car in the rain.  It'll try a lot of folks' patience, I'm sure -- even his most loyal fans will be bothered by the incessant piano ""bell tolls"" in the soundtrack of some scenes, or the constant reminders (in imaginary flashbacks) that Cruise's character is bothered by his wife's near-infidelity.  I know I was.Despite that, it's an apt final film for the long, glorious career of a man who has done more for the cinema, with less movies, than can ever be catalogued.  To try and cite influences for this particular work is futile. Though one might draw parallels to Lindsay Anderson's ""O Lucky Man!"" or Martin Scorsese's ""After Hours,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is no less than a complete work from the cold heart and brilliant mind of Stanley Kubrick alone. It's also a furiously ingenious piece of filmmaking, one that works less on the emotions than on the senses and on the mind.  Unlike most of Kubrick's earlier work, however, it does have an emotional subtext, which is used to devastating effect.Cruise, by the way, does an outstanding job, not as a trained, camera-conscious film actor, but as a mature, seasoned performer.  Here he uses his ""Top Gun""/""Jerry Maguire"" suavity to malicious effect; like Ryan O'Neal's Barry Lyndon before him, he's an egotistical cad.  Unlike Lyndon, he gains our sympathy -- that's key to keeping us from disowning his character and thus negating the entire film.Kidman is given less screen time, but it matters little.  She's mostly seen in the beginning, and she has brief (but crucial) scenes throughout, and a masterful one at the end.  It is safe to say that this is her best performance to date, and those of us who have been ignoring her treasured abilities up until now (the Academy, critics, myself) will be astounded to see how far she's come since ""Dead Calm.""  Her high points:  the argument with her husband that ends by setting the film's plot in motion perfectly captures the way women lure men into arguments when the cause for one is nonexistent (and on Cruise's part, how men can't think fast enough to do anything about it), and her dream confession scene, in which she wakes laughing but becomes tearful during recollection.On a technical level, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" displays Kubrick's trademark perfectionism.  Recreating Vietnam in rural England for ""Full Metal Jacket"" must have been nearly impossible, but the unrelenting accuracy in recreating uptown and downtown New York City is absolutely stunning.  Right down to the diners and the newspaper stands; I shake my head in awe when I remind myself that Kubrick (a native Brooklynite) hasn't been to NYC in decades.  The lighting and photography is impeccable, also, as it is in every one of his films.This is the sort of film one sees more than once.  Once is good to cleanse the palate, to clear out all the residual toxins left from other recent films.  See it again, perhaps a third time, and get to appreciate the graceful, nearly unblemished finale of a man who took the art of cinema seriously.  It's a sobering experience.",Eyes Wide Shut
229,TheAnimalMother,"An Onslaught Of Sight, Sound & Psychological Genius!!!",10,2 November 2009,"Eyes Wide Shut must be one of the most under-appreciated films in the history of film. A true masterpiece that only a genius like Kubrick could create.To me, the film is mostly about the different masks that we wear, (The personas or even disguises that we take on) throughout our relationships with people and society. As well as the fact that we sometimes have to close our eyes to certain aspects of reality or occurrence, a basic necessity for us to function with some sense of sanity. Coming to terms with accepting the reality of human imperfection is part of an undeniable theme here. This aspect is hammered home in the final scene.It is clear with Kubrick's final work that he is the true master of sight, sound and storytelling on film. This film plays like a sonic and visual orchestra for the senses, while the subject matter swirls and pokes at the heart and mind in the most haunting and intimate of ways.Eyes Wide Shut may just be the most open minded study of relationships and the human experience in the history of the cinema. Only the Italian master Fellini seems to even compare to Kubrick on this level of fearlessness and visionary depth.Like most of Kubrick's works, this is a film that can easily be watched over and over again because of it's visual beauty, exquisite detail, and deep rooted themes. In my view, this film in it's own bizarre way is as good of a film as any that have ever been made.As much of a loss as it is to lose such a great artist. Kubrick's masterful storytelling, extraordinary visions, and hauntingly honest reflections of the world live on through a collection of films that in my view, HAS NO EQUAL.10/10",Eyes Wide Shut
230,Phil_H,Kubrick's finale,1,19 July 1999,"This film is being touted as ""Stanly Kubrick's final, hanuting, masterpiece...""Rubbish.Of the above, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" meets only these: Kubrick made it and it's his last film.This film fails to deliver anything other than a lot of Nicole Kidman in the buff, and strange pseudo-porn wrapped in sexual dysfunction.This is not worth seeing, even if the cut 65 seconds were to be restored,
In a word, worthless.  Along with ""Summer of Sam"" these are the two worst films of 1999 so far.",Eyes Wide Shut
231,Soysoy,I don't get it,7,12 May 2003,"Well I'm a long-time Kubrick fan, almost all of his movies are among my all-times favorite, mainly ""2001"", ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Lolita"".I've seen each Kubrick movie at least 12 times *LOL*, even ""The Killer's kiss"" despite its numerous technical flaws and goofs.I don't understand what's happened with ""Eyes wide shut"". Not only this is Kubrick's less enjoyable movie I ever saw, but I actually found it boring! Incredible...I suspect the horrible performance given by Tom Cruise is partly responsible. I never saw such an unconvincing character (Apart from cheap TV-movies ones). Cruise was definitely NOT the guy. Too shallow. A friend of mine told me this was probably on purpose, well OK but what's the point then? He couldn't tell!!Maybe someday I'll understand Kubrick's purpose and understand the real meaning of this movie. Until then, apart from the gorgeous scenes when Bill arrives at the ""party"", and the overall ""Kubrick's eye"" magnificence, I'm still considering ""Eyes wide shut"" as the most bitter disappointment I ever had about cinema.Rating 6/10",Eyes Wide Shut
232,Soysoy,adding some comments,7,14 May 2003,"**please forgive my horrible English** - thanksI've read a lot of the reviews here about ""Eyes wide shut"", and it made me feel like adding some comments to my own review.1/ The fact that I found EWS boring doesn't mean I think it's a bad movie. Actually I think that anyone who states that EWS is a bad movie knows nothing about filmmaking, and should stick with ""Independance day"", ""XXX"", or other stupidities. Gee, there's even this guy who writes "" it looks like a bad blow up from a 16mm print. The sets are pitiful, the lighting is horrid..""... I can't believe it. How people may get pretentious, when they obviously know nothing about what they're talking about. Brilliant cinematography has always been one of Kubrick's strengths, and it still is in EWS. If you think differently, you need an ophthalmologist.2/Even considering the subtext and the metaphoric work of Kubrick, I still can't enjoy the movie despite its many strong features. I'm still convinced that casting Cruise was a mistake. The whole movie, and the whole story (would it be ""real"" or ""fantasmatic"") is experienced from Harford's point of view. He is immature and self-confident, and he faces events and characters that break his small world, and make him realize how weak he is, eventually leading him to total submission to his wife. He regresses to childhood by missing every opportunity offered to him to be an adult. But in the beginning of the film, we see rightaway that Dr. Harford is actually an adolescent. The character impersonated by Cruise is obviously immature, right from the start. This ruins the whole movie for me, as I'm surprised by none of Harford's reactions to the events.  This shallow character is too obvious, too caricatured, so the collision between his miserable personality and the weird oniric threatening world (real or not) he faces doesn't work for me. All I saw is... Tom cruise in a Kubrick movie!3/ I'm quite shocked by highly snobbish comments I've read from self-infatuated people claiming that disliking EWS only shows one's inability to understand it. This statement is very suspect, who are those guys to claim they actually understood the movie, after all? They have their own idea (like I do) of what EWS means, doesn't mean it was Kubrick's purpose. Like with recent David Lynch movies, anyone saying that the purpose of EWS is ""obvious"" to ""intelligent"" people, and confusing only to ""unintelligent"" people, has his eyes wide shut like Dr. Harford. Their world is full of certitudes. Beware of the awakening...I do agree with the idea that many didn't like EWS simply because they can't cope with artistic, challenging movies. But it's not my case (challenging directors as Lynch, Cronenberg, Tarkowski, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Jodorowski and the like - and Kubrick, of course- have a very good place in my collection), though after having played EWS 11 times, I'm still NOT convinced. I'd love to.To all of you who haven't seen this movie, go and see for yourself. After all, it's our beloved Kubrick's very last movie, and it still has many outstanding qualities to offer. Just don't expect too much.",Eyes Wide Shut

234,bilahn,Much ado about not much,6,17 July 1999,"Being a Kubrick film, there is much that is fascinating here, the climatic central scene is amazing---but overall this is a big disappointment. Overly long, ponderous and often boring. The  ultimate import of what the characters had to say did not justify the amount of time it usually took to say it!  I was always waiting for something amazing to happen, but it all pretty much wound down without much to get excited about. There is plenty of (female) nudity, but the reports of incredible sex scenes are way over blown. (Not that really matters). Had the potential to be much more stunning that it was.

235,Deckard-16,I was underwhelmed.,6,22 July 1999,"Like any serious student of film for me ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was easily the most anticipated film of the year and maybe the decade. Stanley Kubrick directed my favorite film of all-time, ""2001"", another Top 10, ""A Clockwork Orange"", and all-time classics, ""Dr.Strangelove..."", ""Paths Of Glory"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"". But alas EWS falls far short of those dizzying high points. It begins brilliantly with a fascinating and dreamy party where the psycho-sexual landscape is set up as precisely as a chessboard and the play is engaged between Dr. Harford and his wife Alice. The opening moves are typical Kubrick and therefore masterful, but then it devolves into a game I really didn't care about. The much talked about orgy scene looks like it came from Red Shoes Diaries. There are some great looking bodies in it (even in the altered US version --which is another story in itself), but what was intended to be shocking was less adventurous than things we've seen on HBO's Real Sex series. I didn't care about Harford and his wife. Tom Cruise does well with what he can in his role but like most of Kubrick's main characters he is an icon rather than a real person. Stanley has gotten away with this more than any other director in history, but here it doesn't work. Nicole Kidman is the best thing about the movie but she dissappears in the second half of it except to come on in time to utter what will go down as one of the most memorable closing lines ever. Kubrick's death is a huge loss for film and filmgoers. His passing hit me harder far more than Di, JFK Jr. and John Lennon, but it doesn't make EWS more than a better than average movie. I would've love to have seen AI.",Eyes Wide Shut

237,jonathandoe_se7en,People tend to miss the point of Kubrick's films.,7,6 September 2001,"When Eyes Wide Shut was released in 1999, shortly after Kubrick's death, every critic panned the film, calling it static, cold and empty. Many people said that the performances where either dull, or just plain over the top. All I can think is ""have these people ever seen any other Stanley Kubrick film"". Kubrick didn't make films to accommodate narrative, look at 2001: A Space Odyssey or Barry Lyndon, and he definitely didn't make films for character purposes Kubrick made films about ideas. Eyes Wide Shut is about the idea of jealousy, it's about sexual paranoia in the home, its about desires and longings. The narrative is non-substantial, the film works better as a long form selection of vignettes that befall Bill (Cruise) through his dark night on the town, and with this in mind it's no wonder that people have hailed the film as ""1999: A Sexual Odyssey"". Because in the same way that Kier Dullea was transformed into the star child, so is Dr Bill transformed into a better human being. The comparisons to 2001 are many, much like that film this also has Kubrick in a more optimistic mood. There's no dehumanisation here, this isn't A Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket; Eyes Wide Shut is showing us that sometimes we take things for granted.The film does however fall flat in the middle, and there are a couple of instances where Kubrick tries to sandwich in the message that `sometimes married couples have fantasies but in the end it's all okay', and I think this might have just been Kubrick panicking when the film went over budget, trying to make the story a little more acceptable. But this is on par with other films such as Dr Strangelove and Paths of Glory. And when you look back all Kubrick's films get negative reviews when they are first released, expect people to finally wake up to Eyes Wide Shut, sometime in the not too distant future.",Eyes Wide Shut
238,Jimmy-128,What a rarity--a movie completely for grownups,7,16 November 1999,"Kubrick ranks with Hitchcock as one of the finest in film history.

Really?I don't know where all the praise is coming from, a masterpiece - really? Yes, its far from being bad but its also nothing special. Take Kubrick name from it and it would be forgotten. If I didn't know I would never suspect it could be directed by him.

240,tanelteder,like a dream,8,2 January 2011,"Suspense and sex are the keywords here. The movie is about one of the most interesting topics and it's sex. It shows how sex can affect a relationship between a nice and young couple and how big influence sex has on how we act to different situations. The one night story which the film follows is suspenseful and sexy so that makes it attractive. Nevertheless, there is not that much nudity or sex on-screen.In my opinion, all the Stanley Kubrick's films are must see. The Glare, long takes, close-ups of emotional faces, three-way conflicts etc are all something of an unique. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are a perfect couple here. They deliver quite well.The story told here is like a strange dream. Something completely different happens which tests your senses and you'd want to know why.

While Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, and the rest of this cast are all solid, the story, and especially the way it is delivered both takes forever to develop and frustrates. 
The dialogue takes forever for the actors to say, and I often felt like if I made hand gestures, it might help to speed up the story out of their mouths.
Certain aspects of the story, characters, and entire scenes serve no purpose at all in this film, other than to elongate it.However, as for the now-famous orgy scene, it is certainly one of the most fascinating and bizarre sequences in recent film.I can't help but feel sorry for the cast and crew, who, while they put forth such a strong effort, end up in such a mess.",Eyes Wide Shut
242,ups-36964,Most underrated Kubrick film,8,9 January 2020,"Although the title is ""Eyes wide shut"", when watching this film, you have to keep your eyes wide open. This film is base on the novella (Traumnovelle) (Dream Story), written by Arthur Schnitzler, who Freud claimed had such an intimate affinity with. Kubrick had spent decades of time adapted the novella to the motion picture. With joint effort of two greatest minds, the film is among the most profound ones, so that requires great effort to interpret. In the very beginning of the film, Bill walked from the living room, through the bedroom, towards bathroom. This move provides us a clear establishment inside this New York couple's house. The view is clearly described by Tim Kreider as, ""The paintings that cover the Harfords' walls from floor to ceiling (painted by Kubrick's wife Christiane) almost all depict flowers or food, making explicit the function of art in their environment as mere decor-art for consumption."" Then followed, Alice, who just finished using the bathroom stand up, made her first frontal appearance. This obvious continuity between the paintings and Alice, combining the starting scene which displayed her naked back, implied that our main female character was also an art work that the main male character had collected. When Alice asked Bill why he wasn't jealous, the answer Bill gave is ""Because you are my wife and the mother of my child."" What he had in mind was that Alice was something he owned rather than the person he shared a life with. Alice talked about her fantasy to Bill that she was ready to give up every thing, including her family and her child just because of the glance of the naval officer. She was saying that in order to protest the Bill's ownership. This revealed more of the submissive position where Alice stood --- Always leading by the male. Her appearance was always associated with the mirror. As analysis in Lacan's theory:""The mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential libidinal relationship with the body image"" Alice constantly behavior of checking the mirror indicates of her loss of self-identification. She was familiar with being a wife and a mother---the ego characteristics required by the society. Alice looked like a serious person, wearing glasses, hardly smile. Not until she was on alcohol, pot or during dreaming, did the relax expression appeared on her face. From this we would know she repressed lots of her own desires, hide the tension, the anxiety deep down, so as to meet the demand of her husband and the society. However, when she was unconscious, she couldn't control of the desires and just let it out. The night, Bill came home from the orgy party, found her giggling during her sleep. But when woke up, she look very terrified. The transition from sleep to awaken is analog with the transition form unconscious to conscious. The four step of dream interpretation ""secondary revision"" could be applied to the dramatic attitude changing from being satisfied to being terrified. She feels guilty about dream cheating of her husband so she forced herself as remembering the dream as a horrific nightmare.Bill maintained his dominant poison, identified himself as the role of the saver, using money to control people such as costume shop owner, the taxi driver and ultimately since he was the only financial support of the family, using money to control Alice. When he wanted to do something that considered as immoral or transgression, he start to searching through the unconscious to find the excuses to keep him away from being guilty. The fantasies of his wife making love with the naval officer occurring three times, each followed by the action of searching other women to fulfill his sexual needs, hooking up with the prostitute, calling his late patient's daughter who expressed her desires for him before and going to the orgy party. He needed the reason for the self gratification. And the idea of revenge to his wife's fantasized infidelity severed him well. From this we can indicate that Bill indeed is a very hypocritical person. He spared no effort finding ways to satisfy his id desires while his wife Alice tried really hard to repress it. I think the scene which he found that the mask lying on his pillow implied that he, not his wife, is the person who cheated and disguised as an honest man. Every detail in this film is carefully designed. The name of prostitute the ""domino"" is actually a kind of mask, which predicted the following masque in held in the Somerton. The password of the party is ""Fidelio"", which was the Italian for faithful. It's severs as an irony because using such word as engaging into an orgy. Also, Fidelio is Beethoven' opera telling the story of how a wife risked her life to save her husband in prison from death. It predicted the result that in the end Mandy sacrificed herself to protect Bill's life. It also was using stairs as a metaphor for social class and the dirt inside the upper ones. The higher you climb, the more bodies you might discovered in their closets. Just as the saying goes: ""There is nothing accidental in Kubrick's film."" Because of the films contains numerous hidden meanings and great complexity. People who watch the film at the first time often found it very confusing. Also, during the promotion, it marketed as an erotic thriller, therefore, for people who just want to watch celebrities couple having hot steamy sex on screen would be really disappointed. It's much more sophisticated and you would notice something new when you watch it again and again.
Overall, it isn't a mainstream movie so some of you may not enjoy it. But real cinema fans will definitely like it. It has a very deep message though",Eyes Wide Shut
243,~PL~,I can't believe it's not nominated for 1999's best film!,10,19 March 2000,"Eyes Wide Shut was the last Kubrick masterpiece (his last film, in other words). We can say his carreer (and life) ended in a nice way (without being mean). This film is amazing, mysterious, very well acted and extremely well directed! I can't understand why it is not nominated for last year's best movie! I thought this one was better than American Beauty, which was my favorite of last year before seeing Eyes Wide Shut (but I didn't see Man On The Moon). I guess the Academy couldn't nominate it because it was ''too hot for Oscar''. This is not the best Kubrick film (with films like 2001:A Space Odyssey, Dr.Strangelove, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket and Clockwork Orange, it's pretty hard to do better than all of these!!!!!) but it worth watching! When I told people I wanted to see Eyes Wide shut, they said ''I wonder why!'' but they were wrong...when you watch this film, go further than watching the nudity and fast-forwarding the rest of the film...if you do so, you won't like the film. I am a big fan of Kubrick movies and I was very interested in the whole film. It was mysterious, the atmosphere was very enjoyable. Kubrick made a kind of mix of his films (Lolita, Clockwork Orange and even The Shining!!!). A must-see! the ending was like the ending of the other Kubrick films, surprising, intelligent and appropriate. I loved it. I give it 90%.",Eyes Wide Shut
244,cinemel,A fitting finale to a classic career,7,17 July 1999,"The final film of director, Stanley Kubrick, has finally been released to theaters. It is a fine finale to a career of classic filmmaking. Although Kubrick has been accused of creating films that were cold and hard with characters to match, ""Eyes Wide Shut"", adapted from a novel by Arthur Schnitzler, introduces us to his two major characters as they are preparing for a gala Christmas party given by their friend. Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) and Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) live a privileged existence in the posh circles of  Manhattan. Their lush apartment is filled with all the accouterments of such a life. As they dress for the party, their demeanor and oral responses to one another subtly reveal the relationship they have in their nine-year-old marriage. At the party itself we meet their host (Sidney Pollack). Here the couple each get involved in a flirtation, she with a Hungarian Lothario, and he with two lovely young models. This is just the beginning of their descent into the world of sexual obsession and fantasy.Kubrick uses his camera as the voyeuristic eye of the audience, never really being clear as to whether certain scenes are real or fantasy. Bunuel did this in his classic French film, ""Belle DuJour"".  Except for a series of expository scenes relating the everyday routines of the husband at work and his wife at home, the rest of the film is sort of a fever dream drifting along deeper and deeper into the vortex of sex and violence that is a combination of their own obsessions and outside events beyond their control.The rumors that have followed the three-year gestation of this movie are generally untrue. Although the film is about sex, curiously, it is not particularly erotic. The famous orgy, which occurs about two-thirds through the film (2 hours 40 minutes long), is slightly muted by the digital insertion of figures that obscure certain body parts and motions deemed unacceptable to the ratings board. Professional critics were shown both versions, but generally agreed that the effect was the same in both versions. Critic Roger Ebert suggested that both versions be exhibited in different theaters. The un-cut version will be shown in Europe. Hopefully, the American audience will see the original cut in its video incarnation next year.Kubrick once said when asked what the ending of the classic, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", meant, that he wanted the audience to bring something of themselves to his films. Therefore, he would not reveal any concrete answer. He said that the reason for the Mona Lisa's smile is part of her mystery. She would lose some of her appeal if DaVinci said that she was smiling because she is thinking of her lover. One error he makes in this film is toward the end he has the Sidney Pollack character give some sort of objective explanation of what has occurred. One could assume he was trying to give in to those who complained about the ambiguity of some of his other films. Hitchcock made a similar mistake in the psychiatrist's explanation of Norman Bates' condition at the end of ""Psycho"". Even this compromise does not materially flaw an otherwise distinct vision.Cruise and Kidman both give performances of which they can be proud. Kubrick's perfectionism is there on the screen. Kidman, in particular has a moving monologue in which she emotionally reveals to her husband, a fantasy she had years ago, which precipitates the rest of action in the film. Unfortunately, her character disappears for much of the remaining film, relegating her role to one basically supporting in nature.The film was completely filmed in England on sets, except for a couple of establishing shots of New York and several long shots of taxis on the streets of Manhattan. New Yorkers will recognize these street scenes as unreal. However, possibly, Kubrick wanted these sets to have a certain surreal ambiance. The musical score also adds effectively to sweep the audience along in what is a series of long scenes of extended dialogue. One hopes that adult audiences will appreciate Kubrick's vision, and it will encourage viewers to discuss their views and reactions to the last of a series of a unique creative works.",Eyes Wide Shut
245,evilmatt-3,An exceedingly complex film that demands multiple viewings,9,17 July 1999,"Anyone familiar with Kubrick knows going in what to expect: a surreal world in which characters interact in what on the surface seem to be inconsequential ways, while beneath the surface other conflicts and storylines rage and churn. So it is: it seemed to me that although in the strictest sense nothing really happens in this film, the conflict and tension are greater than almost any other film I've seen.Kubrick has this way of expanding the film experience to the viewer, and nowhere is it more apparent than here. We are hit with a barrage of stimuli and expected to piece together the story and thematic elements ourselves. Only a truly masterful film such as this one can attempt such a thing and succeed so well. For example, Kubrick's use of colors (and rainbows of course) to represent emotional states or silence to indicate an inescapable situation are as universal as they are powerful.One really needs to see this film multiple times. By the time you figure out exactly what the film is doing, you've missed enough elements that another viewing is imperative. That's not such a bad thing: the film, with its utterly un-erotic sexuality and numerous subtexts is joy to watch.",Eyes Wide Shut
246,ericjg623,"""American Pie"" was better",3,24 February 2013,"There is supposed to be some deep, maybe even profound, message to this movie, but, for me at any rate, I sure couldn't find it. Indeed, my recollection of this film, which I've only seen once, on Pay-Per-View shortly after it came out, was that this was basically really high class porno made by an extremely skilled director. As such, the best (and maybe only) way to enjoy this movie is to fast forward through all the parts that don't contain naked ladies. The problem is, ""Kubrick"" and ""Emotional richness and complexity"" are two expressions that just don't go together. Think about how many of his characters, from Strangelove to this present movie, that you really cared about. The only one that comes to my mind is the unfortunate fat kid who cracks under pressure in the boot camp part of ""Full Metal Jacket"". And that's the problem with this film. We just don't care about these characters AT ALL. At best, this is a stylistic exercise, a slick production that is utterly devoid of real human heart. In that sense, ""American Pie"", which came out the same year, does a much better job of exploring the sometimes embarrassing and often hilarious things that occur when men and women (or, in this case, boys and girls) tap dance around the issues of love, romance, and sex. Unlike ""Eyes Wide Shut"", we see real human beings in real human situations with real human emotions. We can relate to them, and laugh along with them as they deal with the various foibles that come with human relationships. In contrast, the characters from this movie might as well be cyborgs for all the warmth they bring to the screen.",Eyes Wide Shut

NOBODY can duplicate Kubrick's lighting/tone/pace. It's been that unique since 2000/Orange/Lyndon ( I don't know why people rate Shining so much) I wanted to re-focus on the sexual exploitation, corruption and moral tension at play in the broader scenes and orgies: Revised in the light of Weinstein, Epstein, Trump - and the hundreds of corrupt cabals we've had revealed recently in Banking, Politics, the Arts, Business . I think Kubrick had knowledge of the corruption at the top - and he was riffing on a real strata of a certain cabal in Western power stuctures. Not sure it's all that Illuminati rubbish - but he shon a light on something real... maybe.",Eyes Wide Shut
249,raymond-massart,Complex and thought-provoking,9,7 June 2005,"The movie has been excellently and sufficiently reviewed in the many contributions to this site. The main advantage of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" however is that it is always subject to a further analysis or renewed insights as it covers all the aspects of our individual consciousness. The many interpretations which have been expressed here, illustrate the complex and thought-provoking theme of the movie: ""theme"" is not even an appropriate choice of words as the subject matter embraces so much more: reality, dreams, human interaction, aesthetics, depravity etc etc. The title alone is fascinating as such and could easily constitute the basis for a profound philosophical or psychological debate: are we humans so frustrated by our affinity to the animal world that we can only observe our carnal selves from behind a mask? Do we constantly have to close our eyes to our true nature? Is hypocrisy the only means of reaching a higher level? Is beauty but a mere dream and a negation of what we really are? Is compromise our dismal but only means of salvation? These are all open questions and all the possible answers have that relative quality about them that characterizes our desperate earthly condition. Kubrick was a genius in the way he understood and rendered our predicament",Eyes Wide Shut
250,SmileyMcGrouchpants,You find out ... or do you?,10,25 June 2017,"I saw this again recently (two years ago) and I totally got into the weird tone, the razor's edge that this guy's walking, and how he doesn't seem to get good answers for what's going on, ultimately ... what he's told is not just cryptic or obscure, or to mollify him, they're the sorts of things you'd tell somebody who doesn't deserve to know, when you've got answers aplenty and can spare these minor-and-prosaic ones. Everything's all wrapped up and accounted for a few times over, so, why behave as though there's some ""whole enchilada"" to even share with him, to begin with? He's only glimpsed a piece, if that All these alternate identities have to do with cover, with not getting caught out, with the possibility of discovery buried under many onion skin-layers of guise to conceal the goings-on ... what else could be the point? Why unravel it?It's crucial that the piano-player guy only knows a *little*, and then the physician played by Tom Cruise sneaks in, driven by some sense of dislocation at home which pushes him over the line to take some potentially-unwise risks. Everything the Sydney Pollack character tells the Tom Cruise guy near the end *seems* to account for everything, and you'd be paranoid to worry more about having it all wrapped up like that ... right? It's a weird distinction; it's not that everyone on screen is simply ""rich,"" it's that those other people are ""wealthy,"" and the doctor is merely upper-middle-class. (Remember, the Fitzgerald line is actually ""the *very* rich are not like you and me."") He's close enough to have contact with them, but he's not in the ""inner circle,"" and, whatever they might think of him personally, he's not going to get clued in, he's only going to be placated. (They also can't just ""get rid"" of the guy, that's out of the question -- which is why the drama proceeds the way it does. It's not a ""kill him if he's giving us problems!"" fictional-fallacy story.)Part of the problem with catching this lies not just in subtleties not easily explicated without wrecking the whole movie to begin with, but in the use of recognizable stars whom we're accustomed to sitting back and watching do things we wouldn't, anyway. (On the other hand, if Tom Cruise was playing a working- class steelworker, for example, and Sydney Pollack was a champagne-sipping bigwig, we'd know how to take it, but it's not so drastic and pedantically-obvious a distinction in this particular movie -- which is also why the only-in-NYC setting is crucial). Similarly, the narrative strategy of the movie involves putting you in a position whereby catching the tone and usage of ""privileged information"" as deployed between individuals in offhand conversation proves crucial to understanding the action, as well as how much one could guess about what goes on behind closed doors when they're decisively shut tight, quiet as a tomb, emitting no sound from those trapped inside. (I didn't get this as a 28-year-old in '99 when I first saw it in the theater, and the reviews I encountered didn't help.)As a result, I thought the masked-ball scene was really, really scary; Kubrick's use of the music, or, rather, his invoking of how ritualistic occasions would *deploy* specific musical tones towards ends like that, stirring up all the deeper energies of the participants, smacked of esoteric practices that only few people walking the earth would even know *about*. To be not nervous by that point is to be less-than- clear about how hot the water the Tom Cruise guy is in. What is this place he has just waltzed into out of some vague curiosity and momentary spite towards his wife? I think the movie comes together or falls apart, by that point, for viewers if they're not with him, if they can't sense he's walking a tightrope, little though he may be aware of it at the time ...",Eyes Wide Shut
251,blackmambamark,I literally couldn't move.....absolutely brilliant movie,10,8 April 2009,"There are maybe a few films out there, in which there are sequences that you kind of forget that your watching a movie, mainly because you are so fixated on the characters, the dialogue, the musical score, and the cinematography......this film does a absolute brilliant job of executing all of those aspects at the same time. Especially the cinematography......my god, it is truly of epic preportions....but by Kubrick standards, thats already a given. But the greatest scene of all, is especially the mansion scene, and no, not because of the heavy sex and nudity.....because up until that point, Tom Cruises character wanders the street of New York, on his fit of rage and jelousy towards his wife.....this is basically a giant build up, and the delivery and response when he walks in that mansion is truly overwhelming......because i think it was more than the character and the audience expected. But that entire build up and delivery was just so perfect, and it all meshed together with a haunting score..... it still gives me goosebumps to this day. Many say that this is Kubricks worst.....i highly disagree, this is certainly one of favorite films by him. Its just a shame that we wont be seeing movies of this caliber anymore.",Eyes Wide Shut

Even with director Kubrick's notorious propensity for retake after retake, he obviously gave up on getting a convincing performance out of Cruise as a  physician.

I didn't go away loving it and I really didn't hate it, either.  I literally feel no emotion over this film as I usually do with Kubrick films.  It had a definate Kubrick-ian eerie atmosphere, but the content just wasn't there.I don't hold any of the performances responsible for the mediocrity of this movie.  They all did just great.  Cruise was right there, Kidman as stunning and moving as usual.  I think they were a natural to do movies together and would have liked to see more.  In fact, it might be a true test of their acting skills to do another film together now.  A romance story and must make it believable.  Actually, I wish they'd get back together.  Call me a sap, but I just liked them together.  Oh well.I guess I have to take issue with the story itself.  It just did nothing for me.  It was there, then it was over.  It had a plot, just not an interesting one.  It seemed like it had twists but still needed twists.  I don't know, I just wasn't really thrilled.  Maybe I'll try watching it again some time just to see the two together again and maybe there'll be something that grabs me.I give it 5/10 pts.  5 for the performances of the cast and crew.

254,Rainfox,Life goes on. Until it doesn`t.,10,10 October 1999,"'Baby did a bad, bad thing.'Cloaked in the usual Kubrick cloth  long mooding shots, lush set pieces, scintillating camera work and, yes,  many naked woman  the old master gives us the Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman Show. Unplugged. Cruise is great as the disillusioned husband and father, Dr. Bill Hartford (even the name is great), who one innocent, pot-smoking evening learns of his wife`s fantasies of another man. His safe, little world of living the 'good life' in the upper class (Central Park West apartment and all) is completely zapped and undermined. He wanders helplessly through and about the streets of New York, from one yellow taxi cab to another, from one confrontation to another, and gets himself entangled into an underworld of sex and murder. Or does he? Opposite Cruise and at the core of the story is Kidman in a fascinating performance. She will make you cringe with wonder in your seat, uneasy at the power and realism she purveys. The two (married in real life)  especially in the shots they share  deliver some of the best screen time this side of Casablanca. We`ve seen Tom Cruise like this before, but he`s never had this edge or this fire in both speech and eyes. Kubrick really took him that step further and the natural chemistry between the real time couple can actually at times seem offensive, as you may feel like you are invading actual home life and privacy. Sydney Pollack can be seen in a (typical Kubrick) perfectly cast supporting role, and the dark, neon-lit streets, alleys and buildings of New York (filmed mostly on location) makes for a great backdrop to the story.
Images will float and visions will blunder, this plot of men and women, sex and love, life and meaning, reality and fantasy, is the kind of cinema we never knew we missed before we got it. This is the good stuff. Movie making at it´s finest. Relevant and hypnotic, Eyes Wide Shut will be churning in your mind long after you leave the cinema. Food for thought.

256,PeachesIR,"Layered, dark fantasy from the maestro Kubrick",9,10 June 2020,"I watched ""Eyes Wide Shut"" again last night after first seeing it years ago. Stanley Kubrick's final film is not going to be entertainment for the mass-market audience, who may have been curious about the film's sex scenes based on the trailer set to ""Bad, Bad Thing."" In fact, this film is a surreal, layered, dreamlike exposition on society, social class, marriage, fidelity and truth more than it is about sex, although sexuality, sexual behavior and sexual mores are the prisms through which Kubrick tells this dark fable. In 1999, Tom Cruise was certainly already at the zenith of Hollywood mainstream stardom, so it's interesting that he took this role in order to work with Kubrick, and that Kubrick wanted to cast him as the idealized vision of a square, upstanding, white-bread Manhattan physician devoted to his beautiful, and very bored wife, played by his real-life spouse at the time, Nicole Kidman. I read that Kubrick wanted a real-life couple to explore the darker aspects of married life and sex in the story, and it sounds like he put them through some psychologically painful experiences to elicit the tension required for the two characters. Cruise plays Bill Harford, a man whose ego is absolutely shredded when his wife, Alice, reveals that she wanted to cheat on him the year before. This knowledge leads Bill to embark on a weird night of sexual misadventures that leave him emotionally shattered. Bill is wealthy, handsome and intelligent, but the film shows that he's still a pawn in a decadent, corrupt society where there are far wealthier, far more powerful and manipulative men in charge who use him when it's convenient, and use and discard very beautiful (and frequently naked) women without a fleeing thought for their humanity. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" left me with the impression that there is a light and dark side to life and humanity, and that at certain times, we cross back and forth between them, sometimes with titillation and delight, and sometimes with horror. Cruise's Bill is emotionally emasculated by his wife's desire to cheat and by some of his experiences on his night of wandering through New York's sinister side. It's funny how he keeps showing everyone his New York medical license to be sure everyone knows he's a doctor, so you should trust and respect him! I wonder if Kubrick especially liked the fact that Cruise was a few inches shorter than his wife to highlight his feelings of inadequacy (which neither Bill nor Cruise should have, certainly). I found Alice rather cold, possibly written that way, but it felt believable too, as she seemed like a woman who felt unfulfilled and marginalized in her marriage and life, sort of the stereotype of the wealthy doctor's wife whose husband spends long hours at the clinic instead of with her. She lives in a gilded cage but feels trapped and bored. Kubrick famously used color and lighting to great effect, including scenes shot in blue light and scenes soaked in red. The orgy scene felt rather tame for all the fuss. Maybe Kubrick did not intend for there to be any fuss. I feel that the scene was more a metaphor for class and sexual exploitation in our society. Shame on the MPAA for insisting that CGI people be inserted to partially block the view of some sex scenes. Let adults watch Kubrick's film unedited. I was able to view the unedited version of the sequence online, and there was nothing shocking at all. No need to censor it. The blocked view scenes look awkward.",Eyes Wide Shut
257,jmerlino,"Yeah, about that orgy...",6,14 October 2020,"Evidently Kubrick didn't realize that stuff like what he imagined the rich people doing happens every weekend in suburbia (sans the robes and faux-occult stuff).I love Kubrick. 2001, The Shining, and A Clockwork Orange are among my favorites. This was just disappointing. Even if you take the dream interpretation, it boils down to a guy finds out his wife had a fantasy about another man, and broods over it to the point of imagining murders. If this is the way Tom Cruise's character really thinks about sex, it's straight out of the 19th century.Nobody likes the idea that their spouse might fantasize about other people, but any adult who's been through a relationship or two understands that your fantasies don't stop just because you've hooked up with someone.Six stars for being a Kubrick film and the usual technical brilliance.

259,xmdbx,I Think I'm Disappointed,6,28 March 2019,"This is a difficult film for me to wrap my head around. Stanley Kubrick is unequivocally my favorite director of all time. My two favorite movies (Dr. Strangelove and 2001) are both directed by him and I love most of his films. He is objectively a master of cinema. Having that opinion going into a film can sometimes be problematic. I have to resist the urge of over-analyzing things and treat it like a regular movie. I find it hard to tell what is important in Eyes Wide Shut. Is it the dream vs. reality narrative? Is it the lust? The power of the ultra-rich? Something unseen and unsaid? Or, more likely, a combination of all of these things? There are a few films that are so different than what we're used to that you have to rely on a feeling that what you just watched was special in order to get a grasp on what you think of it. I think 2001 is an example of that but I think Mulholland Dr. is a better example. At the end of both films you basically have no idea what you just watched but, at least in my experience, you're okay with that. You know you're not supposed to get everything. With Eyes Wide Shut I didn't really get that feeling. I went into the film ready to watch something that I would recognize as amazing and ended up let down that I found it to be just alright. I was left with a lot of questions. I think a lot of this feeling can be attributed mainly to a couple of things. One being Nicole Kidman's character. I found too many of her scenes hard to watch. Her slow, monotone dialogue took over nearly every scene she was in and not for the better if you ask me. I understand that it's supposed to be somewhat dream-like but there is just too much of it for my tastes. The other thing that irked me was the theme music. I couldn't help but think that the piano theme was lazy and that is coming from someone who thinks that Kubrick movies have some of the best scores there are. I have a feeling that it was intended to make the viewer uneasy but I wasn't too big a fan of it. Conversely, I thought the framing and lighting were immaculate, as expected. Cinematography is not something you have to worry about with Kubrick. The acting was pretty good, including that of Kidman, I just had a problem with her character. The story was compelling and thought-provoking but that is more due to the source material than the film itself. The liberties that the movie takes with the source material is what has kept me thinking of it for the past few days and I think a film that is on your mind for days after (in a non-negative way) deserves some credit just for that. I am about as confused as I've been after watching a movie and I have a feeling that my qualms were intended but at this point they are mostly lost on me. The film is often thought of as misunderstood and I probably agree but, at this point in time, I don't find it to be a masterpiece.",Eyes Wide Shut

I won't spoil anything here about the story and the scenes. I did watch Eyes Wide Shut without any knowledge about the story. All I knew was, that it's a Stanley Kubrick film. And then, I have seen the most stunning scenes I have ever seen in a movie. Even if it would be fiction only, but it is about real happenings.Sky Dumont plays overwhelmingly.

261,MadReviewer,Made Twenty Years Too Late,5,19 April 2001,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" might have been considered director Stanley Kubrick's most controversial masterpiece . . . if he'd filmed it in the early 1980's, as he originally intended.  While artistically and visually brilliant, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" suffers from relying on a script that would've been considered daring and shocking in years gone by, but for 1999 and beyond it offers nothing particularly outrageous.  With little substance behind the intended shock, the film is left with little else to entertain the audience.  It's kind of like watching ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?"" or even ""Basic Instinct"" today -- at the time those films were released, they pushed a lot of emotional buttons, but now the issues and topics they dealt with seems rather tame.
The film deals with the relationship between Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman), a wealthy, happily married couple with a small, lovely daughter (Madison Eginton).  However, in an awkward moment Alice confesses to William that she considered cheating on him early on in their marriage.  She never actually acting on her adulterous thoughts, but William becomes so enraged that he goes out alone into the night, contemplating the future of his marriage and looking for a random sexual encounter with which he can gain a certain amount of revenge.And that's it.  There's a lot of scenes (some imagined, some real) of kinky sexual encounters, but nothing incredibly over the top, nothing that hasn't been seen in mainstream films before.  William's reaction to his wife's confession seems entirely too strong.  No, I don't think that any man ever wants to hear from his wife that she thought about having an affair with somebody else, but to react as strongly as he did seemed slightly odd.  If she'd actually had the affair, it might've made more sense.  Scenes that could've been built into dark, brooding, tormented sequences of William agonizing over what to do often seem pointless because of this . . . and over two hours' worth of them is mind-numbingly boring overkill.There's still a few highlights -- Cruise puts in a solid performance, considering the material he has to work with, and Kidman actually shines in what really is a supporting role as Alice.  Also, the mood, the camera angles, the odd lighting -- in terms of technique, the film ranks as one of Kubrick's finest efforts.  Considering all the hype that went along with this film, though, it's very disappointing, and even on its own merits, it's average at best.  Decent fare for a Kubrick fan, but otherwise, don't bother.  C-",Eyes Wide Shut
262,Snoopy1,SPOILERS AHEAD,1,30 November 2002,"First of all, this movie is sexist.  There is full frontal female nudity all throughout the movie, whereas we see no male nudity, except for maybe Tom Cruise's chest.  The most despicable scene is where there are a bunch of fully clothed men dancing with a bunch of naked, Hollywood perfect women. In what world are the men clothed, but the women naked?As for the actual movie, it was mediocre.  I didn't think the acting was anything special, even for Cruise and Kidman.  The plotline was kind of dull to me...and the meaning of the movie was washed away behind the nudity which was there, top to bottom.  And the nudity didn't have to be there.  I feel that the movie could have been a lot better...first off, if the actors had given it 100%.  Secondly, if they either a) did away with some of the nudity or b) put in some male nudity to give it some class so it didn't seem like trash.  All in all, I wouldn't really recommend it unless you want something to fall asleep to or jack off to.",Eyes Wide Shut

Eyes Wide Shut is such a movie, it leaves you with many open questions and I find this very disturbing. I expect a movie to have at least a closure that will answer all the questions if not answered before in the film. If Eyes Wide Shut had answered the tons of questions it made me think of in the movie I may have enjoyed it 100 times more.This movie is big disappointment for me, don't expect too much of it.",Eyes Wide Shut
264,Aditya_Gokhale,The Grand Finale,10,30 January 2008,"I guess Kubrick couldn't have wished for a better way to end his impressive filmography.'Eyes Wide Shut' is a perfect ending to one of the most accomplished directorial careers and easily one of his finest works, right up there with 'A Clockwork Orange' or his early gem 'The Killing'.The magic of this movie lies in how the story unfolds..and deeply explores the human psyche; delves through the numerous assumptions and beliefs that one lives with, regarding the opposite sex, regarding marriage and regarding commitment and fidelity. At the same time, it urges the viewer to think.The story may seem a slow pacer, but not a single frame or scene is out of place or irrelevant to the story.It all starts with a party Dr William Harford (Cruise) and his wife Alice (Kidman) attend. They encounter certain strangers there. The couple converse about the ongoings at the party, and the discussion soon turns into a sour one, with Alice confessing about how she once almost cheated on him. This is when William goes into a state of shock and disbelief and starts questioning his assumptions about married life and commitment. Unpleasant thoughts cross his mind following that revelation. And about this time, he leaves for a certain funeral and this is how his bizarre odyssey begins.Kubrick builds up the atmosphere like a hypnotist, and makes sure the viewer watches the story unfold in awe..and get a feel of what Cruise's character experiences.The rest of the movie has to be seen to be believed and any synopsis won't do justice to this magnificent film.This is one of Cruise's finest performances. Kidman does a terrific job. Of the supporting cast, Sydney Pollack is superb as Victor Ziegler. Likewise, Todd Field, Rade Serbedzija and Mary Richardson in a small role.But what makes this movie much more watchable is the fantastic cinematography, brilliant direction, and the oh-so-mesmerizing score. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a Collector's item for any respectable film buff. A hypnotic experience...do not miss it.",Eyes Wide Shut

Keep your eyes pretty much closed and wonder, did I just see a bunch of skin and wish I had seen at least a soft porn film instead of this? Keep your eyes shut and you won't have to wonder how a supposedly so smart doctor would not even give a hoot about the piano player.  You won't have to wonder how stupid the doctor's wife is for saying she would have taken a roll in the hay and given up her life for a stranger.  You will see some incredible nude women.  Women that are drop dead gorgeous specimens.  You will see the doctor play with a woman without showing anything of her body and make it look like she is ready to bed him right then and there.  But then you have a dead hooker and the missing piano player and nobody who gives a hoot?  Please don't let the doctor be my friend.

Doctor (as he so vigorously reminds people) Bill Hartford's (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman) wander through their own repressed sexual feelings in a series of unfulfilling and scandalous rendezvous. The protagonists are unerringly narcissistic, but in such an innocent animalistic way that I do not feel shame or disgust for their behavior, rather a detached understanding of their motives. It is almost a relief that the promised and foreshadowed tardy sex scenes never manifest on screen, as it retains the sense of purity in the exploration. The pacing is excruciatingly slow, and meticulous in showing Bills raw emotional journey, and must be approached with a patient mindset.",Eyes Wide Shut

268,brower8,"Half brilliant, half horrible!",6,11 May 2004,"Stanley Kubrick's reputation of course relies upon other films, and this one is more likely to impress film students for techniques than any audiences most likely to be disappointed when they are drawn into the odd connection between Kubrick and some major movie stars more than thirty years his junior (Cruise and Kidman) who have no other connections to him. I must admit that for the first thirty minutes all I could think was ""What a piece of pretentious rubbish! How could Kubrick soil himself with this?"", and then it grew upon me, but not in time to convince me that Kubrick didn't make one film too many (this one) or should have made some other movie as his unintended swan song. The result is mediocrity: half masterful, and half amateurish.As usual for Kubrick, set design is consistently masterful. Enough of this movie grates on me to damage the rest. This is not an early work of a promising filmmaker; this is the last complete work of a decayed master. Perhaps, as with the other master Hitchcock, his taste failed him as he aged. Perhaps he fell in love with a novel that he thought needed a cinematic treatment -- and bit off far more than he could chew. Kubrick moves an expressionist novel set in Germany or Austria across an ocean and nearly a century later in New York City in the 1990s, and he gets some interesting results. Interesting, but not wholly-satisfying. Expressionism, over the top a century ago, is silly today even if recent art has gone even more over the top. First of all, Kubrick's mastery of set design gives a beauty to an ugly story, half pornographic and half a brilliant mystery, and the opulence makes the ugliness of much of the behavior all the more troublesome. The chilly personas of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (and this is deliberate) underscore the ominous qualities of the film.I find the short, and potentially deadly, excursion of the clinical Dr. Hartford (Cruise) into the secret (Satanist?) ceremony by overhearing a password a bit contrived. Then again, expressionism itself is obsolete because it is contrived; what was over the top then is what alienated risk-seekers search almost routinely.Kubrick took a chance, and this one spun out of control. For good reason Expressionism did not become more than a cultural fad, dying out about twenty years after its introduction.",Eyes Wide Shut
269,cagebox111,A Fantastically Tense Film - Kubrick's Commentary on Sex,8,2 July 2021,"Kubrick's last movie is not an all-time classic like some of his other films, but Eyes Wide Shut is a fantastic movie nonetheless. It starts off a little slow but the tension builds gradually and reaches its climax when Cruise's character enters the party his friend Nick invites him to. That scene, both unexpected and amazingly tense, is among the most effect and captivating scenes in Kubrick's career and really makes the movie. Once Cruise leaves the party the tension continues as he deals with the aftermath of what he saw which leads to an ending that is up to the viewer to interpret. I would have preferred some more firm answers but from reading the synopsis of the novel on which this movie is based, it ends similarly ambiguously. Regardless of just how evil the group at the party was, the atmosphere created by Kubrick is chilling and effective and the movie stayed with me hours after viewing.I believe Kubrick was trying to make a social commentary about America's obsession on sex. For Kidman's character, her fantasy that she almost acted upon would have lost her all she had worked for her whole life, a life built with a loving husband and daughter. For Cruise, when he sets out on the night, the hooker he almost sleeps with has HIV and would had he gone through with it would have gravely harmed himself. Obviously, the party (orgy) he goes to does not give him sexual gratification either and (possibly) almost causes him great harm or even death. Aside from sex between a husband and wife we only see sex here as a great perversion and someone is always harmed from the action even to the overdosed prostitute at the beginning of the movie Cruise is called upon to treat. The happy ending comes when the two leads accept letting what they have seen/fantasized about be forgotten and just live happily together and with their daughter. That is where the pleasure comes from, not from sex.",Eyes Wide Shut
270,nikxatz,Kubrick's swan song is about human desires and sex- I'm obsessed,8,10 August 2019,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is Kubrick's last film and the conclusion to my summer Kubrick Marathon. During those days, that the honour to watch these weird and effective stories come alive from maybe the most influensial director of all time and one of my favorites for sure. Eyes Wide Shut is a weird experience and it differs from any other Kubric film. It is a film which can be seen from many angles and in order to be fully understood and appreciated, it has to be viewed multiple times.In the film, Kubrick grows deep into our very own human desires for sex, truth, connection, consumerism and creates a ""universe"" where everything is shiny and we get to take a look to how consumerism and money have changed the world and everyone has become more or less a being that gives full attention to what people think about them and how they look. As I see it, the couple of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman can be seen a mirror to the society that Kubric wants to portray during the whole film. The husband eagerly consumes without giving a second thought, tries to meet new women and engage with them, he cannot stop trying to achieve his sexual goals and money and generally his whole economical and social state is a ticket for completing his desires. Notice that his first line in the film has to do with his wallet or that he does not hesitate to give money even if he does not need do. His consuming nature and desire for more and more are viewed by his long walks from place to place and his whole obsession with that orgy mask party. He goes to gritty extremes and I love those scenes which purely reveal his obsessive nature. Cruise is a blast and let's not forget that 1999 was a blast for him, because he was exceptional is Magnolia too.The wife is more of a self-lover, a narcissist. She hold the title ""of a beautiful lady"" and we can see that see always car about her looks and likes it when people call her pretty with flattering words. One of the shots that reveal her nature Is the shot where the couple kisses in front of the mirror naked and the wife looks at her self while she is passionately kissed by her husband. She is also haunted by her dreams of another handsome man having sex with her and the idea of cheat poisons her souls but she actually cannot let it go. The dreams reveal her deep desires for another more free love, an affair out of all this and her inability to escape all this devastates her.And dreams do play a really important role in this film. I think that in the end this film has an uncertainness to it. A lot of objects and scenes give you the impression that they might be a complete lie, something fake. We are not sure if the crazy and alienating elements are a matter of imagination or a symbolism or even real. Therefore, the film has a dream-like atmosphere.
Kubrick's direction and the style definitely boost this fantasy element. Most of the scenes use colorful lightbulbs hanged in every room and street to provoke that tone (anyways, it is set during Christmas). The slow move of the camera during the walks of Tom Cruise in the night, the blues and reds, the clever choices of switching between steady and shaky cam, the dream sequences...The technical aspects are great, like every other Kubrick film, though some sequences, especially during the 2nd half feel kind of weirdly shot and this is probably because Kubric's sad loss during the shooting. Leon Vitali, Stanley's loyal sidekick handled the shootings till the end and finished the film, but I think that some sequences felt more of Hitchcock or PTA than actual Kubric. That made the film kind of messy and less captivatingAnd this is m main bug too. It is not that I hated anything in the film, it is a really interesting film and you can make a lot out of it, but I felt kind of bored and uninterested during some parts , like it lacked a true consistency and core.Overall, the film is pretty good. Its cinematography, camera and soundtrack are perfect. Great performances. The script is a different thing compared to Kubrick's previous films and I liked that Stanley wanted to talk about humans and the society by using a single couple with a weird relationship. It is about desires, deceit, love, lies and truth, identity and it hinges on the consumeristic and ""oriented-by the-looks"" society that we are living in. As a fact, I feel that it is a film that I prefer thinking than watching, at least for now. But anyways...every Kubrick film demands multiple watches.I also want to add that I felt that the story might be a huge reference to Adam and Eve? A man and a woman naked succumbing into cheating and sinnery??? Well that's a bingo. And I appreciate that Kubrick movies are so open to theories and analysisKubrick is and will always be one of the most creative and genius filmmakers of all time. His films are crazy and unique and mad and funny and colorful and cool and meaningful and true and ""Eyes Wide Shut is no exception.And I love himAnd you know, there is something important that you need to do as soon as possible...What's that?Watch this film (or rewatch it )",Eyes Wide Shut
271,ironcraftleague,A complex story with a lot of ideas.,9,11 January 2019,"This movie is complex, emotional, creepy, and all around dream-like. It takes our understanding of sex and love and warps it to where you just see plain lust. That could be horrible and really destroy the movie but it strangely fuels it. The idea of cheating, having sex with other people, and more of that kind of stuff. It's a pretty movie in-general, the colors and lights have these blurs and mixes of colors. The angles also make the scene more beautiful to look at. Everything else is done well, however there is one problem. The time in this world is really unrealistic, and I don't know if that's intentional or not. Either way, it brings down the film. People might call me crazy for saying this but that's what I got out of it. Great movie, pretty scenes, good leads, and of course that cult scene to top it all off.

272,Jesse-45,Best movie of 1999!!,10,26 July 2000,"In 1999, where commercial films were often disappointing and bad, Eyes Wide Shut brought so much more to the big-screen. The trailer was great. It didn't reveal very much at all. We watched the film, not knowing very many things at all. And that's the problem with movie previews now-a-days. They show way too much. Eyes Wide Shut didn't. And that's one of the things I loved about the movie.This was a very captivating movie. I felt like I was inside a film after viewing it. It was spectacular. The lighting and everything was masterful. Stanley Kubrick has made so many great movies...2001, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, Full Metal Jacket, Paths Of Glory, The Shining and this flick is definitely no exception what so ever. He died as a filmmaker who made movies that were infamous.To continue the subject on Eyes Wide Shut alone, it was a masterpiece...his last great masterpiece. Tom Cruise's character just pulls the audience right in, and on the way, we move around in our seats to get comfortable and to feel safe, when we see him go off into these bizarre, creepy and mysterious incidents. We feel poignant for these characters, after what we've seen them go threw, in their real-life and dream-life adventures. I think one controversial element of the film is the fact in may be found extremely un-comfortable for some married couples.But one very thing that I find very disturbing about Kubrick's world. It's the lack of respect he has recieved. Through life. And even through death.",Eyes Wide Shut
273,audrablum,Just another piece of smut disguised as cinema,1,6 October 2018,"This week I watched Eyes Wide Shut (1999). To be be frank it was nothing short of smut wrapped in the title of ""cinema."" Storytellers everywhere should be embarrassed that we continually get away with this. There was nothing interesting about this film and I'm surprised that Kubrick would ever had thought this was his ""finest work."" There was probably ten minutes of well written story and the rest was just smut scenes. Let's say we get away from the smut for a minute, the rest of the story was really stale, surface level, and pathetic. The characters were extremely immature and uninteresting and it felt like there were major loopholes in these characters. For example, the way that Alice speaks isn't at all how women speak to the people they are with. The only time words like hers exit a female's mouth is when a man is sharing his fears with her and claiming that's what she said to him in his dream/thoughts, etc. Not only is her dialogue clearly written by a man, but she seems to be suffering some sort of mental disorder, and the doctor, who is likely trained in medical matters, marries this mentally ill character anyways? I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but let's go ahead and chalk this film up to what it really is an unapologetic man-tasy (male fantasy). Now, this supposed doctor, who has had to master the art of psychological disciplines like maintaining focus on sleep he likely only got days ago, among the other mental toughness of a doctor, psychoanalytic training, etc, can't deal with something his mentally ill wife said to him, so he, being highly emotionally unstable for some reason, gives himself license to have an affair? Okay, let's just run with it. Now, every important female in the movie is a cookie cutter version of Kubrick's fantasies. Everyone of them has the same body-type, the same color hair, and similar facial features. If you wanted to continue arguing that somehow this smut is ""art"" then you at least need to change up your ""artistic elements"" or you're really just validating the case for sexual eroticism for the sake of pleasure. I would also be more sold on this being of ""artistic value"" if somehow the playing field was equal, but, lo, it is not. T and A is available in just about every scene, but heaven forbid we see a man's dongle. It is merely ever suggested that a male character's manliness was ever exposed, whilst women had the privilege of exposing themselves fully. If you want to cry ""art"" then you should have fully exposed both sexes, otherwise it just comes across as derogatory and chauvinistic. There is no substance to this film. If it wasn't an assignment I would have shut it off in the first ten minutes and never looked back.",Eyes Wide Shut
274,Niro,Eyes Wide Closed,2,18 March 2000,"This is a vile waste of celluloid, and if you think it's an ""art house film,"" then you've never been to an art house.I concur with Michael Kenmore's review here: this is no way to remember Kubrick.Once again, Cruise fails to create the effect that he can act, even in a truly awful film.  Kidman, in a surprisingly small role, is the best thing here except for the cinematographer.Even Cruise's hair is bad.  And that's saying something.The preposterous [and lengthy] script is worse, however, with absurdist dialogue in abundance.  It literally mocks itself in its self-importance, and ~ in case you don't get it ~ telegraphs the film's every move [example: the password for the ""private party"" is ""Infidelio"" ~ GET IT???].If there's even the slightest moment of suspense here for any of you, please rent virtually any Hitchcock film.And the ""it's ok, I'm a doctor"" wasn't working the first time, nor the fourth.The excellence of the camerawork is utterly overwhelmed by the most irritating film score in years: within the first hour I was trying to reach through the screen to crush the fingers of Jocelyn Pook and her grating ""two notes on a piano in every octave imaginable"" music.The so-called ""extremely graphic"" content?  Mild, at the very best.Sure Kidman is topless a few times, and there are a few glimpses of her [rather extraordinary] derriere.  But we've seen these goods before.  Nary a bum from Cruise for the ladies.  And the so-called orgy scene, complete with the famed digital shadowy cloaked men to hide the allegedly explicit parts, is a limp disaster.And you thought that Verhoeven's lamentable ""Showgirls"" was the most unerotic movie ever made which tried to shock you with its nudity?  Or was that ""Romance""...The only scene which I'll remember is the one in which Kidman confesses her almost~infidelity to Cruise, which sets this on its course.Here's how bad this film is: all three interviews on the DVD version are tributes to Kubrick, not to this film.  Steven Spielberg even weighs in with a ""best actors"" list ~ Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, etc.  Ahhh... nary an actor among them.  Movie stars, yes.Just like Tom Cruise.See ""Paths of Glory"" for Kubrick's brilliance.  Or ""2001.""  Or ""A Clockwork Orange.""  Or ""Full Metal Jacket.""

275,shadow_blade-89459,Eyes Now Open,9,6 October 2018,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999) is a dramatic thriller mystery about New York City doctor William ""Bill"" Harford, played by Tom Cruise, as he pushes himself into dangerous sexual temptations following an argument of mental infidelity with his wife, art curator Alice Harford played by Nicole Kidman. Alice admits to Bill that she had extremely impure thoughts about another man while with Bill after she accuses him of cheating on her at a Christmas party. I personally have issues with films over 90 mins, but this film was overly immersive and I couldn't pull myself away. The storyline was gripping and the visuals were outstandingly enticing for a film that appeals both to the dark and light. It made me go through a range of emotions from anger to sympathy to I don't even know how to feel.I am not a huge fan of Tom Cruise because I feel he has one persona that he uses in 80 percent of his films, but I deeply believe that Kubrick was able to bring out one of the better, more authentic Cruise performances out in this film. The acting in this film was outstanding. I felt the pain and anger stirring within Bill as Alice explained her ordeal. I felt the desire for an alternate life every time Alice explained to Bill a different universe to her present. Overall, this film is surprisingly great and the runtime is nothing to fret. I would recommend this film to anyone who has the time to just embrace a story that will affect your emotions.",Eyes Wide Shut

Well, it's impossible to put entirely aside for a Kubrick fan, so while I completely love this film, and view it as as close to perfection as any film ever made, that question still looms. The film is as mesmeric as a dream; tantalising from beginning to end. It grows with you, changes meaning with each viewing and as your own perspective develops. The 0.1 missing is attributed to that itch that comes from not quite knowing how ""finished"" it is.

278,iamyuno2,Disappointing And Over-Long But Some Good Elements,6,28 December 2013,"An overblown movie that could have been much better if it had been much shorter and directed a bit better, the whole thing is an enigma. How did so many top name talents wind up putting out such a mediocre product? Even otherwise good actors put in less-than-average performances in this one, making you wonder what direction Stanley Kubrick gave them. In other words, did Nicole Kidman decide on her own to talk incredibly slowly to the point of poor acting and unbelievability or did Kubrick tell her to do so for some unfathomable reason? I suspect (since Kidman has done much better work in other films) that Kubrick was going for some weird stylistic twist that just did not work. Tom Cruise is also unusually stiff in many scenes. The pace is too slow, too, and the characters unsympathetic. It's hard to get into a movie where you disrespect the characters. That being said, there's a basic core story here that doesn't unfold until nearly the middle of the movie that becomes interesting and should have been the focus of this movie. (One wonders what impact this movie might have had had the middle scene not been censored - with monk-like shapes placed strategically over naked bodies.) Another thing: why Kubrick felt the need to make Kidman's character a poor example of a wife is curious and gratuitous. Another stylistic annoyance: the characters' constant repeating of whatever someone says to them is really grating; both Cruise's and Kidman's characters are made to do this. Much of this movie should have wound up on the editing floor. There are too many boring scenes - even when characters are absolutely naked. Speaking of which, Kubrick's showing of Kidman's bare butt in several early scenes is gratuitous and obvious - not having its intended effect because these scenes have no reason for being in the film (at least that I can understand). She's dressing - so what? How does that move the story along? (It doesn't.) Another big gripe: the final scene limps off lamely without any real character redemption or discoveries and then ends scatologically to shock - with a gratuitous comment that only trivializes this movie and makes you wonder what Kubrick and his writers were smoking. That being said, there was a kernel of a good movie here, but it was lost in an attempt on the one hand to make a bigger picture out of this tale than exists here and to shock on the other hand (and - PS to any Hollywood director who has not learned this yet: nudity, four-letter-words and sex do not shock anymore; they can, in fact, seem cliché - as they do here). You know, what made some of the movies of the '30s so great was their crackling dialog - fast-paced, ingenious. The slow dialog in this movie produces the opposite effect - dullness. Incredible especially if you realize how many scenes of naked people are in this movie. The lesson here is clear: nudity does not make a movie interesting. A dull story is a dull story, naked people or no. Very ironic: here, one of the most boring movies ever, has perhaps the most nudity and sexual content of any mainstream film of its time. Makes you yearn for a return to the old movie ethic of the '30s. One final question remains unanswered: what about their experience (as real husband and wife) in making this movie caused Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman to divorce shortly afterward? I have to feel it had something to do with what went on during the filming of this albatross.",Eyes Wide Shut
279,machngunjoe,Much respect to Kubick...but,4,1 August 2008,"I love Stanley Kubricks movies, absolutely love them. Overall I felt this film was trying very hard to say something but fell flat. It is an ambitious attempt.First the GOOD:I love the idea of the film which was an exploration of one man's journey into sexual and moral discovery. Midway through the film you get the sense of an amazing thriller is being unleashed before you. I love the idea of Tom Cruise and Nichole Kidman (who were married back then) doing this movie. The movie had the dry subtle humor that Kubrick was known for and I loved that part of it. Now the BAD: There were a few problems with the film. My biggest annoyance was the dialog. Many times in the movie the dialog would go something like this: person:1""Take off your clothes"" Tom Cruise: ""Take...off...my...clothes""So many times in the film someone would speak to Tom Cruises character telling him something and he would just repeat what they said back, but very very slowly. After the 5th time it got very very annoying. The score was decent except for the single piano playing during suspenseful moments. A single piano note playing over and over again. Also very annoying.The plot of the film had great aspirations but after the midway point I thought the suspense was built up in perfect Kubrick style but there was never any conclusion. Also Tom Cruises character had the most random thing happen to him that it seemed unrealistic and more or less unrelated to the plot of the movie. Some of the scenes I felt went on for way too long like Nichole Kidmans crying scene when her husband came back form the party.I have tried very hard to like this movie and was among the excited fans waiting to see this movie when it first came out.",Eyes Wide Shut

This film is *awful*. Terrible plot, bad acting - even the picture and sound quality were bad. Kubrick must have needed to money. And Cruise and Kidman must have felt like making a dirty film together (not an uncommon thing for married couples to do). Even the sex was bad. I fell asleep during the orgy scene.

282,realalexrice,Hypnotic and misunderstood,10,8 June 2021,"Initially was at a loss for words with this one. I can't necessarily explain the feelings this film brings out, but I can say they feel real personal and there's just something so off yet so painfully real about (most of) this movie and it is just really undervalued in Kubrick's filmography, I think. Besides being one of my favorite looking movies ever, the midpoint turn is one of the scariest heading down rabbit hole reveals I've really encountered in a film and it just disturbed me for the entire time (you know the point) and after as it continued provocatively building to the disturbing and bizarrely cathartic ending, which haunts me as the final scene in a Kubrick film. It's perfect in it's imperfectness and I get an insane level of both joy and sadness watching this movie.",Eyes Wide Shut

Lion,"powerful, exciting, human",10,26 July 1999,"Some of the scenes of exposition are languorous, and the biggest complaint for me is that it ends too perfunctorily (things tie themselves together too easily at the end), but this is a GREAT MOVIE, erotic, exciting, dangerous and totally engrossing.  It was stimulating sensually and intellectually.  I like Tom Cruise and look forward to his performances.  He's a very good actor.  Neither he nor Nicole Kidman really give spellbinding performances, but they acquit themselves very well (she's more of a supporting character after about the first 40 minutes of this 160 minute movie).  That sounds like faint praise, but its not - these are more than solid performances. Elements of real sexism are few.  Both sexes are treated essentially as sex objects, although the women are much more often undressed - one female is nude throughout, but it is acceptable considering the circumstances.  The women are for the most part gorgeous.  This is Kubrick's best work since Clockwork Orange - better than The Shining or Full Metal Jacket.  Absolutely shimmers with dangerous and exciting sexuality.  I loved it.  I was sexually excited enough and mentally stimulated enough to lie awake thinking about it at night.  And not one-handed.  10 out of 10.",Eyes Wide Shut

Some scene set ups and lighting still had something of the detail-obsessed film maker Stanley was.Like the ever present Xmas lighting throughout the movie.Everywhere there is the combination of red,green and white Xmas lamps...creating a beatrangening Kubrickian effect. And of course the music worked fantastically in some scenes. Acting , characters and story where very meager though. The least-good Kubrick film i'v seen so far.",Eyes Wide Shut

The movies mentioned above he also wrote and helped produce. His talent is so vast that his films come in great variety. Just from the films listed above one is a War Film, A look into a possible future, A Horror epic, and a Sci-Fi adventure. Now he comes out with a suspense filled, sexual thriller. You cannot help but keep your Eyes Wide Open and the dialogue will keep your ears open too. I was surprised by much of what was said. What appears to be soft porn is actually a story of Love, Trust and Faithfulness. Tom Cruise and Wife Nicole Kidman did the film justice. It is sad that we will enter a future without new Kubrick films and he will be sorely missed. R.I.P. Mr. Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut
286,Jules45,Seems like there is an alternative for Viagra,6,28 May 2010,"Meeting the in-laws for the first time can be uncomfortable, especially watching a film that guarantees the awkward fidgeting to kick in. Luckily I wasn't presented with this scenario, so as a future warning it's probably best to stick with The Sound of Music rather than suggest this.Eyes Wide Shut, other than being mentally scaring to the people who ban the word 'Willy' in their home, is a very odd movie indeed. In fact other than bordering the porn genre and making the American Pie films seem worthy of a U rating (even the rubbish new ones), it's hard to know what to make of it.Doctor Bill has everything. Pretty wife, great job, family lifestyle and even looks as handsome as Tom Cruise. Oh err, yes that's right it is Tom Cruise. That is until his wife - Kidman, who quite literally gives plenty of meat to her role, confesses to almost cheating on Bill.Obviously when such a situation occurs it is best to get as laid as possible with anyone with a pulse, rather than talk his issues through with dear wife Alice. Or that's what Bill wants to happen. None of this is particularly odd, only that Bill would rather spend time outdoors in New York City than be with his frequently-undresses-as-soon-as-the-camera-comes-within-a-mile-of-her wife.The mid way point when it takes a Rocky Horror type turn for location and mystery, and where it all gets very peculiar. Still no spoilers from here onwards, so if you want to know what happens this is worth a rent (again reminder, not with the in-laws).It's recommended not to be borrowed from a teenage boy, since if you know of the annoyance of a scene from a DVD being vastly overplayed and becoming blotchy, you will definitely find the first one hour thirty minutes a bumpy ride - and unsurprisingly not for the plot. Ahem.The ending will separate viewers so much into mixed opinions, that doing julienne on an onion would have less division. You'll end up feeling you have either wasted two sexually fuelled hours of your life or that you can't quite understand what to make of it or you'll love it or you'll hate it or you'll spend another two hours afterwards Googleing Nicole Kidman. Maybe you should just leave it several years to re-watch to see what you think, if the in-laws feel up to it.",Eyes Wide Shut

The producers writing credit name that the film is ""inspired by the novel by Arthur Schnitzler "" implicitly ""Traumnovelle / Dream Story"" from 1926. Given the temporal update, the film's script closely follows Arthur Schnitzler's text. On the other hand, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is also inspired by Wolfgang Glück's film ""Traumnovelle"" from 1969. How on earth did the Kubrick come up with the idea of recruiting T.C. for the lead? And did he ever feel he made the right choice? Tom Cruise does what he does. Millins of fans is proof of that. But to involve him in a delicate story by Arthur Schnitzler? One morning William wakes up to find that his life has changed. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail.

Kubrick was basically a photographer, and you can see that in every film he directed: angles, tracking shots, composition, symmetry, editing... He, Hitchcock, Welles, Murnau and Dreyer are the greatest visual masters of all time. But what was Kubrick thinking of when he made this piece of rubbish?!!... How could he say this was his ""greatest work ever""? What happened to the man who made beautiful masterly films like ""The Killing"" ""Paths of Glory"", ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Barry Lyndon and ""The Shining""? He must have been going senile when he made this pretentious piece of crap and called it his ultimate masterpiece! Was it necessary to make a two-and-a-half hour movie to tell a dull story that could be compressed in ninety minutes or even less? What a waste of celluloid!And couldn't he have possibly found a better leading actor?!! Dear god, Cruise is a dull moron who can't act at all but flashes his smile and touches his hair every minute and looks this way and the other while he says ""you know, hum, yeah, honestly baby"" all the time. A total bimbo-boy. A totally much overrated movie that if it had been made in a low budget by a second-rate director it would have been slashed both by the critics and the public.

289,Stephen-12,"No, unfortunately",5,18 October 1999,"Since there are already buckets of comments about EWS, I'll be brief:1) Hard to believe this really was the final cut. Scenes disappear into nowhere, the pace is sometimes deadly slow, and the whole structure looks indulgent, even by Kubrick's standards.2) Too much Cruise and not enough Kidman, who brings a tremendous virtuosity and depth to her limited part.3) As always with Stan, utterly brilliant use of Ligeti's music, which stopped me from hating the film altogether. Nice camerawork and lighting in places, too.4) Good bits: the row in the apartment (contains the best writing in an otherwise unworthy script); the orgy (though only for its style, not for its content); the moment when Cruise finds the mask; er... that's it.5) Why doesn't Sydney Pollack act more often? He's terrific!6) I don't have a problem with sex in movies, but here it was gratuitous and actually rather sad. One can, unfortunately, easily imagine Kubrick doing the editing using only one hand.7) The last line is predictable and stupid, and rather trivialises the whole thing.In short, EWS can't make up its mind whether it's a Hitchcockian thriller or a psychological study of sexual relations within a couple. If SK had stuck to the latter, it would probably have been a very good film. Unfortunately, despite flashes of his previous brilliance, this one doesn't work, and it's sad that this is the note he went out on. Still, at least Cruise nearly manages to act.",Eyes Wide Shut

Remove even the mask. Fill in with what you like, or leave it blank. A plot will remain, arguably coherent, likely not as visually arresting, driven or interesting, but unquestionably a context in which to try to understand the prelude and possible coda to a crisis in the relationship between married and child-rearing urban professionals. We know these people, even if they smoke pot and listen to Shostakovich.I've not since seen Tom Cruise so vulnerable or Nicole Kidman so quietly terrifying. Their off-screen relationship, during and after, has no bearing, for this is Stanley Kubrick's waking dream, from the torpor of everyday life in defense of the relentless pursuit of the fleeting and superficial, to the gradual surrender to a visceral, sensual, claustrophobic and candy-colored alternate reality, to eyes forced unwillingly wide open. And we are all made welcome to it, whether we want to or not and whether we like it or not.And when you suddenly awake from a vivid and intensely pleasurable dream, do you not consciously strive to revive, re-create and re-enter it? Bill Harford tries repeatedly.They don't make movies like this any more. I am convinced that for the most part they've stopped trying. Kubrick is doubtless judged by his more famous movies, but such is the true measure of his genius. No other film director convinced me to pay as much attention to what appeared on-screen or want one or more re-viewings to try to see what I'd missed. I wish he was still filming though full well realize I'd likely still await the final cut...I am also convinced Kubrick knew he was dying. The actors' lines are his own.

The night Alice talks about her sexual fantasy with another man sets Bill on a strange journey of jealousy and lust throughout New York City where he learns from his old friend Nick about an underground cult where men and women engage in sexual rituals.

As for that really annoying plonk plonk of the piano key, praised by some, I wanted to strangle someone by the end of the film. This film could have been 30 minutes shorter if Kubrick had just encouraged the actors to walk a bit quicker, I even checked the play speed at one point.

295,bhicks56,"That's how the censors eyes were, I gather",7,6 December 1999,"I happened to enjoy this film, probably because I saw it before many critics put it down. I'm a Stanley Kubrick fan, but I know when he doesn't hit his mark. He hits it here, but not dead on like, say, FULL METAL JACKET or A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.At first you wonder where this film is going. It doesn't get moving until Tom Cruise takes a walk out of the house. I felt like I was right with Cruise in the New York City set in London (what was all that about?) and though critics snuffed his performance, I thought it was more than ""decent"", though Nicole Kidman had more to work with, since she had more emotions.
The thing I didn't like were the crowds around the ""exhibitions"" going on in an underground society Cruise falls into. They were digitally added because Warner Bros. didn't have the guts to go with an NC-17 the MPAA had the nerve of giving this film with the uncensored ""watchers"". This completely ruins Kubrick's art. It also makes the so-called ""inappropriate"" imagery more distasteful and disturbing than it actually is.There are parts in this movie that come out of leftfield (though most of them, I think, describe certain sexual opportunities and erotic fantasies) and that just adds onto the length of this long film. It does make the movie more interesting and unpredictable, but at the same time they seem unnecessary. This film has been helmed as a disappointment. Maybe it is, in Kubrick standards. Maybe this isn't the cut he intended before his untimely death. But I can actually watch and enjoy this one again and again compared to, say, THE SHINING.",Eyes Wide Shut

Think - An overseeing, controlling and protective presence who nurtures two young innocents, male and female, in a secluded world where anything can happen. Think - a ""snake""like smoothie seduces the young woman on the dance floor and draws out certain ideas and urges in her mind. Think - she follows her impulse to share this experience of knowledge with her man. Think myth.  Think Orpheus and Eurydice, perhaps reversed. Think Pandora's box.

And even the rush I felt as I watched the big yellow words ""Star Wars"" zoom away on The Phantom Menace's opening night pales in comparison to what I was going through in the minutes before this, Kubrick's final release, unspooled before me.  Roughly an hour later, though, I had pretty much forgotten about the great director and settled into the depths of William Harford's mind and conflicts.  While it lasts, this movie completely immerses its audience.  But somehow, Eyes Wide Shut isn't like Kubrick at all; while his stories usually only use characters to prove a point or make some statement about society, this film attempts to achieve psychological realism in its portrayal of a doctor's sexual escapades and their effects on his marriage.  It's as though the whole movie is just one giant experiment, like Kubrick wanted to see if he could really create a believable human character.  There's still meaning and messages and all that good stuff, but they seem tacked on to the complicated plot and occasionally shocking sexual imagery (which was shamelessly softened to avoid an NC-17 after Kubrick's death by the use of Austin Powers-esque ""covering"" techniques-- let's pray to God they give us the original version on video).

299,Toph-22,secret masterpiece,8,24 January 2021,"'Eyes Wide Shut' is a multilayered and complex movie. At first glance this is not necessarily obvious. You think it's about the pure disintegration of a marriage. But the longer you think about the movie, the deeper you descend into the unconscious, into the inner self of man and draw further insights from it. You realize what a fascinating work this movie is.A supposedly small event causes Tom Cruise's character to feel a sense of jealousy. That little seed in his head grows into a tree in a flash and throws his life out of whack.What is the significance of human drives?
How can these go hand in hand with societal perceptions?
To what degree is something justifiable?Each person plumbs this limit for himself.The movie is characterized by precisely this inner conflict between societal values and the instincts that are deeply rooted in human beings. These urges cannot always be put into words or concrete ideas, but you know they are there. The main character embarks on a journey that actually lasts only 2 nights, but is perceived much more intensely.This inner conflict, in which way he can satisfy his desire, is depicted with the help of the events shown. This does not mean that what was shown did not take place. It merely serves as a bridge, a parallelism to clarify the inner events.The movie deals with complex processes in a human being, but in such a way that it remains comprehensible for the viewer. The longer you think about the movie, the more facets you recognize. That's what I like about this movie.",Eyes Wide Shut
300,rchrdshelt,A complete waste of time,3,17 December 2004,"I sat through this long, slow moving movie about a year ago and when it finally ended I couldn't believe that was it and I'd just sat there for nearly 3 hours watching such rubbish. It builds up suspense then at the end just forgets all about it and thats it! It starts off reasonably well, and has very good acting from Cruise and Kidman in the 2 leads, but the story itself doesn't make sense at all. All the movie is really is Tom Cruise wondering around New York having heard his wife had an affair, to meet a grieving woman, a prostitute, an old friend, a costume shop owner, and finally onto an erotic party. He also spends about $1000 in the space of 2 days and doesn't care that much! This whole evening takes up about an hour and a half of the movie and is incredibly slow-moving and annoying as the lines are slow and it moves at a snails pace the entire time. Then its the next day and everything is really weird and by the end of it you're thinking what the hell? There are that many plot-holes and their is no point in the movie at all!In the end this movie left me confused, bored and annoyed. So I advise you to skip this and watch a good move like The Green Mile or Seven.This is a complete waste of time and I give it 3/10 only for Cruise and Kidman's acting which was good I must say",Eyes Wide Shut
301,keith-moyes,Decline and fall,3,17 June 2009,"Eyes Wide Shut has some unusually eloquent and persuasive advocates and some equally eloquent and persuasive detractors.If I gravitate towards the detractors it is because I see this movie as the culmination of a trend in Kubrick's work that had long troubled me.Rather than attempt a detailed analysis of its strengths and weaknesses (both of which have been covered in other excellent IMDb reviews) I would merely use it as an illustration of what I see as Kubrick's principal weakness as a film-maker. He was too slow and got progressively slower.I mean this in three senses.Firstly, I cannot help noting that it took him just 8 years to make his first 5 features and another 35 years to make his next 5.These later pictures all spent years in development. I doubt if this long gestation period was a good thing. If you spend too long thinking about a picture it is easy to lose track of why you wanted to make it in the first place (A.I.?) and there is always a danger that you will end up squeezing the life out of it.Secondly, when Kubrick finally got a project into production he would take months and months to shoot it (14 months for Eyes Wide Shut). Notoriously he shot dozens of takes of every scene, constantly trying out new things. He got away with this because he used a very small crew and was very economical. His pictures may have taken an age to complete but they never went over budget.But again, I suspect this obsessive concern with the minutiae of every shot was counter-productive. Sometimes, Kubrick couldn't see the wood for the trees. He was so focused on how each individual scene should play that he lost sight of how the picture as a whole would work with an audience. You cannot force a movie to be great just by sheer hard work and painstaking attention to detail.Thirdly, the movies themselves are often too slow and none more so than Eyes Wide Shut.For one thing, no movie in recent years has spent so much time just getting characters from one scene to another. When they cross a room we see every step. For example, Tom Cruise is called to the bedside of one of his patients. We see him in a taxi, tortured by thoughts of his wife with another man. Then Kubrick cuts to an empty lobby just as the elevator arrives. The door opens and Cruise walks slowly across the lobby and through another doorway. As he does so, the camera dollies to the left so we can see him pass through that door and across another room. He rings the bell of an apartment. We cut to the interior of the apartment. A maid enters from the right and walks all the way across the hall to open the door and let Cruise in. She takes his coat and they exchange a couple of words before Cruise walks across the hall and over to the bedroom door. He knocks. Next, we cut to an interior of the bedroom. The door is opened and Cruise walks in. Finally the scene begins. And this is from the man who once spanned 5 million years with a single jump cut!This scene is not an exception. The whole movie is like that.This is compounded by the highly stylised acting that Kubrick came to love. In this movie, people often talk in slow motion. Nicole Kidman, in particular, is often required to break each sentence down into disconnected fragments, with agonising pauses between them. This is not her normal style and must have been specifically dictated by Kubrick.Fine - except that much of the dialogue is achingly banal and unconvincing. Tom Cruise's flirtation with the two girls at the party is feeble enough, but those lines sound like Oscar Wilde in comparison to the ones exchanged by Sky Dumont and Nicole Kidman. What was Kubrick thinking of?This is a valid question, because he probably knew exactly what he was doing. If the dialogue is banal it was because he wanted it that way. If the pacing is funereal it is because it was part of his design for the picture. I suspect that he wanted it to play like a lucid dream. Lucid dreams seem very normal when they are happening: it is only on reflection that you realise how strange they actually were. In Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick was probably aiming at an apparently realistic surface, but with subtly surrealistic undertones.For me it didn't work. The surface is just too prosaic to hold the interest and the undertones are too studied and too calculated to be unsettling. As a result, the movie is cold and clinical when it needs to be passionate and engaged.Ultimately, there is too much thought and too little feeling: too much technique and too little instinct.I would draw a somewhat artificial distinction between movie artists and movie entertainers. It has nothing to do with quality: there are lousy artists and great entertainers. The difference is that artists make the movies they feel they have to make. Entertainers make the movies they feel their audiences want to see. Unquestionably, Kubrick was an artist. He always followed his own Muse. For a long time I was happy to go along for the ride, but eventually his Muse took him to places where I couldn't follow.From my perspective, his career after 2001: A Space Odyssey was mostly a story of decline and fall.",Eyes Wide Shut

Is a sequence where an 18th century venetian carnival is coupled with an orgiastic cult ritual have any relation to modern borgeuois America? Would prominent citizens or anyone for that matter actually want to engage in the kind of debauchery witnessed by Cruise ? Does a movie which opens with Nicole Kidman's bare behind and closes with her utterance of the f-word have reasonable merit? Odd characters who drop in and out of the plot, a ludicrous pseudo-suspense of the piano score, an extremely slow buildup which ends abruptly at about a third of its logical progression, are some of the picture's more baffling aspects. Indeed, the question that arises as the credits begin to roll is not ""what happened?"", but ""why?"" Why was Kubric compelled to make this ? Was it the voyeristic prospect of working with Nicole and scores of other nude women? Hopefully not just that. Regardless of his motives, the end result by no means makes the impression of a total waste, possessing the kind of lush camerawork we'd come to expect over the years, as well as a consistent level of interest that renders ""Eyes Wide Shut"", like all of the auteur's creative output, worthy of discussion and repeat viewing.",Eyes Wide Shut

When I saw this in the theater nobody understood what this film was about and left scratching their heads. Some people left the theater early and I almost left with them. This film made no sense and this was very disappointing acting by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Why was this film kept a secret before it was released? I still can't understand, or get my head around the storyline. I wouldn't even call this film gritty.Just a disappointing performance by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.

305,johnmichael-2,Dreamlike! I Am in Love With This Film,10,17 February 2008,"The first thing you must notice is that, in accordance to the title of this review, I LOVE ""Eyes Wide Shut""--not ""like"", not ""appreciate"", but LOVE. As I write this, I am a 17-year-old male who has watched this film four times already, and I shall watch it many times again.""But all the negative comments!"" you say. ""All the people who said this film was Kubrick's worst! That it was unsexy and slow!"" Yes, the sex-to-nudity ratio was very low, and yes, it'll take you over half-an-hour longer to watch the movie than it would to read the novella, but if the physical act of sex and quick pacing were all that mattered in a movie, I wouldn't be here right now.""Eyes Wide Shut"" was severely misrepresented by its hype. It is not an erotic thriller; it is a psychosexual drama/mystery. It is about Dr. Bill Hardford and his wife, Alice, and her confession of sexual longing that sends him on a dreamlike odyssey to discover his own sexual desires and where his wife fits into the equation. It is not romantic. It is a serious drama, easily Stanley Kubrick's most sophisticated work (though ""A Clockwork Orange"" edges over it as my favorite), and not a single word, image, sound, or musical note is wasted. I love every minute of it.To truly enjoy ""Eyes Wide Shut"", you cannot pop it into your DVD player for a passive romp in front of the screen. You must immerse yourself in this film--watch the characters interact with each other and with the scenes around them, let the music and the sound sing their symphonies to your pulsing heart, and, above all, be willing to THINK and HAVE PATIENCE, two things that don't come all that easily to the broad masses.Though Stanley Kubrick is often partial to unknown actors, you will recognize some of the faces, other than Cruise and Kidman. There is Sydney Pollack and Todd Field, but there is also Vinessa Shaw (from ""The Hills Have Eyes""; director Alexandre Aja began working with her because of her role in this movie as the whore Domino), Leelee Sobieski (""Never Been Kissed""), and Alan Cumming (""X-Men"" and ""Spy Kids""), all coming together from movies that range from mediocre to pretty darn good, but they all reach their pinnacle here, in ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Even the small roles--Rade Serbedzija as Milich, Sobieski as his daughter, Marie Richardson as the woman who declares undying love for Bill Harford over her father's deathbed, and Cumming as a hotel desk clerk--are lavished with detail, encapsulated in not only their dialogue but also in their body language and facial expressions.Another thing to notice is this: Stanley Kubrick spent 15 months shooting this film (when most directors could have done it in 3 or 4), and it really shows. Never has a film felt so unrushed, nor so comfortable with what it is. This film breathes as if on the zephyrs of a dream. There is not a moment when the actors look as if they're rushing through their lines or going through the motions; Kubrick not only gives them time to prepare for their roles, but he also gives them screen time to let their actions speak instead of their mouths.""Traumnovelle"", translated as ""Dream Story"", was the basis for this movie; might I add that the movie follows the novel very closely except that it transplants it from 1920s Austria to New York City in the 1990s. And yet it keeps the feel suggested by the original title, for never has a movie been so like a dream! It has both the sweet parts and the nightmarish parts, and then the plain weird parts that make no sense at all. And it is slow--very, very slow and very, very long, like a night in which you cannot get to sleep--but every single time I watch it, I never grow antsy towards the end! ""Amadeus"", ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and ""The Exorcist"" all got me antsy at one point or another, despite the fact that I love all of these movies and have watched them all multiples times. But, with ""Eyes Wide Shut"", I am perfectly content to watch the movie play out in its own sweet time, and cutting this film down to 120 minutes or less (which any other filmmaker would have and could have easily done) would have ruined the dream that this film is. Have I already mentioned that I am a 17-year-old male, by the way, a product of the sound-byte generation?I am gushing into my keyboard, but somehow I feel my words are inadequate. Let me sum up by saying that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a film you can never hope to see the likes of again--the same can be said for any Kubrick film, especially since he never made the same kind of film twice--and it would be a travesty to miss it simply because you don't have the patience for it. I say GET the patience. Exert a bit of brainpower and try to sink yourself into this film until you're in over your head. It's not something most of us are used to doing with films, but it is entirely worth it.Call me a collegiate who tries to squeeze meaning out of void places. Call me a teen who likes to see his nudity. Call me a person who wants to appear smart by giving this film 10 stars. Call me a Kubrick freak. Slice it any way you like, but I love ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and I think you will, too.",Eyes Wide Shut
306,fullonrobotchubby,A Journey to Nowhere for Nothing,4,15 August 2006,"Stanley Kubrick was a genius director. There, now that you can't get me wrong, Eyes Wide Shut is quite a bloated piece of work. A married couple attends a party, leaves the party, shares a doobie, and question each other's faithfulness. After the wife (Nicole Kidman) reveals a close call of cheating and before the discussion can end, William Harford (Tom Cruise), a doctor, receives a late call to duty and must abandon his wife for the night, shaking off his high. Once the doctor leaves his home (with visions of a cheating wife in his head), he unintentionally winds up embarking on an adventure of sexcapades full of mystery, discovery, and oddities. My favorite scene is the first unexpected turn of Harford's journey (if you ask me) when a newly grieving widow makes a move on the young doc. Perhaps the problem was Kubrick was not alive to properly explain the film enough to reach critics and audiences alike, but something is missing in the final installment for the Kubrick Kollektor. For this critic, I'm not sure any explaining could save it; the film as a whole comes off as a pathetic showcase for the aging Cruise's fading acting talents. Cruise's deteriorating sanity these days probably could have been stopped if we had realized that Eyes Wide Shut and Vanilla Sky were the disguised cries for help they seem to be now (That was a joke... sort of.).",Eyes Wide Shut
307,smithpaulusmc,Eyes Wide Shut,7,16 July 2020,"Kubrick fans know his work intimately. From garish, blood red set pieces to long tracking shots, they immediately recognize his signatures. And even though Eyes Wide Shut (1999) would be Kubrick's final masterpiece, his renown did not die with this film. On the contrary, Kubrick's vision lives on though works just as Eyes Wide Shut, carrying forward his need to comment on humanity's more base emotions and desires.Eyes Wide Shut centers on New York-based medical doctor William ""Bill"" Hartford (Tom Cruise) and his beautifully misunderstood wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) as they navigate their relationship through the lens of lust, morality, and a need for identity outside of their supposed marital archetypes. After Alice reveals to Bill that she once considered leaving her whole life behind for a Naval officer that locked eyes with her in a hotel, Bill embarks on a 24-hour moral bender, encountering sex workers, ethically corrupt storeowners, and a secret, cultish orgy hosted by the city's elite.Cruise and Kidman are perfect for their roles, likely because they merely have to be themselves on screen. The ending of their real-life relationship is almost tangible on screen. More notable than the duo's acting chops however is Kubrick's direction and cinematography that he crafted with Larry Smith. The warm aura of the film's internal shots juxtaposed the cold, winter of Manhattan's streets engenders a sense of duality in the viewer, begging him to consider the black and white, yin and yang of morality. Is there such a thing as good and evil, or are we all just prisoners of our desires which are only kept in check by societal expectations?By no means will I opine that Eyes Wide Shut is Kubrick at his best. I found myself watching the credits roll with a sense that something had been left unsaid or fleshed out. Still, it is the final note of his life's symphony, one that mirrors this film's score: sharp, abrupt, yet undeniably beautiful at times.",Eyes Wide Shut
308,LDB_Movies,Thought-provoking and visually stunning erotic thriller.,7,27 July 1999,"Stanley Kubrick's last film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning erotic thriller.  Kubrick will undoubtedly be nominated for Best Director at next year's Oscars (which overlooked him for winning that prize his entire career).Kubrick's trademark camera moves, colors, and sets are all here-- they reminded me a lot of ""The Shining"".Ultimately this film is about fidelity in marriage-- not sexual perversion, or anything like that.  I didn't expect this kind of theme, but it works well and proves more ""adult"" than any kind of blatant eroticism would be. 
Nicole Kidman gives the best performance in the film, despite the slow-talking that, contrary to another user comment, actually starts in the scene where she is drunk and dancing with the older man. 
My criticisms of the film are that, at 2:45, it is way too long.  It slows down considerably and could have used about 30 minutes edited out.  The slow speech of all the characters, near the end, becomes.... really.... annoying. So does the soundtrack, which, though effective in some scenes.... gets on your nerves.Overall, a nice effort, and worth seeing-- 7 out of 10.",Eyes Wide Shut
309,M2b,"Kubrick's Epitaph: ""Was Lincoln Right?""",1,17 January 2001,"""Can you fool some of the people all of the time?""The first IMDB comment is illuminating.  This Gazzer-guy is clearly taken in by the name Kubrick and has checked his objectivity at the door on the way in.  I would love to read his comments if Kevin Costner was labelled as the director, just to fool him.How bad is Eyes Wide Shut?  A porn ripoff called ""Thighs Wide Open"" is a considerably better film with more to say. Porno's that try (and fail) to put in some sort of socially redeeming material are often quite a hoot. But in ""Thighs"", they have a why-don't-we-all-take-off-these- stupid-masks"" scene that is just exquisite in it's irony.Yes, take off the stupid masks!  There is a underworld in New York City (and many other cities) of sexual promiscuity and multiple partners and whatever can be imagined but there is certainly NO SEX MAFIA in New York or likely anywhere else. If there's one in London, then why didn't the old stiff place his film there! Why defame New York City?Kubrick lost it before he died. This is not an art film. This is a bad film.  It has nothing to say and none of the characters in the film even begin to approach reality. Approach!Last, I would love to see the sales figures for the film's sound track.  It will likely take the grammy award for best single-note-piano-recital category. I often find myself humming that unforgettable tune in the elevator.Kubrick's real epitaph: ""Died Dumb.

There is no classic protagonist to win us over, nobody triumphs and nothing is resolved, except that evil wins the day. Demonic worship clearly represents evil in this film. It is revealed midway with no forewarning. How this ties in to human sexual behavior is for the viewer to conclude. However, the storyteller pulls no punches as to his intention. The enticement sparked in men when they see a beautiful woman (Kidman's nude expose) contrasted to men that hide their identity behind grotesque masks as they seek sexual gratification is just another take on a very familiar theme. Maybe the incentive for this film was to reveal the exploitation of women by a monstrous cult. However, whether Kubrick knew of such a cult is inconsequential. That women are forced, even young girls, into sexual slavery is a sad reality that needs more exposure in an apathetic world steeped in depravity.I don't know how Kubrick died.

314,Castor-5,An excellent final masterpiece by the best director of our time,10,16 July 1999,"I have sat through this film twice in it's opening day and words themselves can't describe how brilliant Stanley Kubrick really is.  This is his 13th film, being known as the longest shoot in film history, and might just be as remembered by his fans right up there with A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey.From those who have seen the previews or trailers and feel very interested in seeing the film, don't read the reviews that give away anything.  The less you know about the film the better it is and that is why nothing has been given away about the film until now as the critics release their reviews all over the nation.  For the full experience of Eyes Wide Shut, go in there with your interested mind only, and see where Kubrick brings you in this ""thriller about jealousy and sexual obsession.""  Those should be the only words that should sum up the plot for you, anything else would reveal too much.This is a film the Academy won't overlook.  Being the last film of Stanley's it's always to be remembered and I can see nominations already for Best Picture, Best Director (Kubrick), Best Actor (Cruise), Best Actress (Kidman), Best Supporting Actor (Pollack), Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing all being announced as the next awards show comes early next year.Unfortunately we won't see the film Kubrick has intended us to see until it comes out on video.  It would have received an NC-17 which Warner Bros. was to afraid to accept so we must sit through a digitally-altered 65 second scene.  I don't think this film was intended for younger audiences in the first place, and defiantly not intended for film-goers who only want to see the sex between the two main leads.  This is an intelligent thriller, not an erotic pornography, so be prepared to see how far the film can take you. 10/10",Eyes Wide Shut
315,zevt,Maddeningly intriguing - it has staying power even if you don't like it,8,2 March 2013,"Like most Kubrick movies, a very unique experience whether you like it or not. My personal opinion of this movie is constantly wavering for years now. Even while I re-watch it, I find myself not liking certain aspects of it, but unable to let it go.Cruise and Kidman, once a couple in real life, act as a couple that has reached a crisis. The crisis involves sex and the issue of sexual fantasies and their dangerous and ignored place in a marriage.It attacks immaturity and the act of burying your head in the sand when it comes to other people's human frailties, flaws and fantasies while accepting your own. Hence the title.Dr. William Harford (Cruise) is a typically naive young husband who thinks a woman, and especially his wife, is faithful because she requires love and stability in a relationship. He flirts at parties, seems faithful, but also seems to be oblivious to the dangers and hypocrisies of his fantasies and the way he sees women.When he fails to show jealousy over a suave man that hits on his wife, she brutally crushes his naiveté by telling him of a time where she was willing to leave him for a fling with a sailor. Although it is an aggressive and rude confession, it's easy to overlook her admissions of fear and conflicting feelings for him, and her message to him, which she does a bad job of conveying, is clear once you think about it with mature sensitivity.(spoilers) He then wanders through the city, staggering with the implications and unpleasant images that this confession triggers, and is so outraged, angry and confused, that he tentatively pushes his flirtations and fantasies a few steps further. This night of strange sexual encounters is almost surreal, with people hitting on him for the strangest reasons, coming close to infidelity with a sweet hooker, all leading to the notorious cult-orgy scene.And then comes the day-after, full of disappointing realism, daylight, and scary repercussions. He finds out how dangerous his encounters could have been. There is a death which may or may not have been caused by his naiveté. There is a plausible explanation, but is it really plausible? The movie doesn't answer this question. It leaves us hanging with our own imaginations, like a fantasy. Instead, it is back to reality for the couple, only this time their eyes are opened to their flaws and responsibilities and possible choices.Given the above way of looking at this movie, her last line becomes clearer. It is a crude awakening that sex is not always a romantic, or harmless fantasy, and that adults don't just make love to their wives, but *uck as well.On the other hand, the movie may just be saying that humans are led by their animalistic drives regardless of dangerous consequences, and it's time to wake up to this fact and accept it the way it is. It doesn't explicitly raise the issue of making responsible choices. That's the kind of movie this is: Ambiguous, but thought-provoking.It is not really an erotic movie. Kidman's nudity in the beginning of the movie is just as engineered as the rest of the movie: She starts as a sex object and a mother, gives us a strange, mysterious look in the mirror, then forcibly becomes a sexual person with flaws and immoral sexual fantasies of her own.There was much hullabaloo over the cult-orgy scene and what it did or didn't show, but whether genitalia was shown or not is irrelevant. I found the whole scene ridiculous and mechanical until I realized that it is exactly the effect it was going for and that it needs to be taken as a surreality, and is only there to involve the audience in a fantasy experience detached from reality and a tangible eroticism, and with unexpected, unknown dangers.Besides the ridiculous orgy, another flaw is Kubrick's ability to drain some scenes of their blood, drawn out with overly-pregnant pauses and slow pacing, possibly due to his famously pedantic multiple takes. But, in some cases, this helps the atmosphere and gives you time to absorb the scene.This movie is a lot of things. It is an art-house movie about sex for adults. It is a horror-thriller for men in a unique sense of the genre. It is definitely a thought-provoking movie. It doesn't seem to appeal to female audiences as much as men though, but perhaps this review will help appreciate it a bit more.I may have explained too much for a movie that wants to be open-ended and provocative. But if nothing else, I wrote this for myself to try to organize my thoughts and figure out why it glued itself to my mind so.",Eyes Wide Shut
316,daved-3,"Ponderous, pretentious and ultimately silly",5,1 August 1999,"I find it hard to believe that anyone could take such a silly film seriously.  The psychology behind what initiates the plot is not handled credibly, the plot twists that develop via the now-famous orgy sequence are laughable (as is the entire orgy itself--where did Kubrick come up with this stuff, 50's porno flicks?) and the ultimate denouement irrational and unfulfilling.  Kidman is reduced to a couple of good scenes but little screen time (and almost no screen time when she isn't on display); Cruise just walks around looking perplexed.

320,darioilg,Kubrick's last gift to cinema lovers,9,23 January 2017,"Stanley Kubrick died four days after showing Warner Bros. the alleged final cut of ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Those close to him claim that he considered it his best work ever, like many great authors do in their old age. I can certainly see why Kubrick thought so (if he actually did): EWS is the absolute, perfect representation of his kind of approach to cinema. Disoriented characters, an eerie duality, in this specific case between the world of daylight and that of nighttime, broken pieces of dialogues, loss of control over one's own purposes. In one sentence, Bill is THE Kubrickian character. The story itself, another adaptation from a novel, is hauntingly mysterious, with its apparently random encounters of strange characters, from the menacing unnamed follower to the sketchy owner of the ""Rainbow"" shop. The night wanderings by Bill reminded me of a simple, yet smart film by Martin Scorsese, ""After Hours"", which could be an inspiration for some of it. Another engaging aspect are the many inner links between different scenes that eventually add up to nothing but give a weird sense of connection and of a bigger scheme behind Bill's actions: the one that struck me most was the ""Place under the rainbow"" reference made by the two models at the party, which connects to a locale under the ""Rainbow"" shop where Bill buys his costume. As in most his films, Kubrick has a taste for the esoteric, hinting at many things without explaining anything clearly, which is to me his most interesting style feature. Ironically, I think that in this film Kubrick was so explicit while attempting to show us his own way of cinema that it loses some of the wonder the viewer has in his most ingenious works, first of all ""2001"", where the idea behind the film is so hidden and unclear that to understand it makes for one of the greatest experiences cinema can offer.Kubrick's style choices for this picture are more similar to those made in ""Barry Lyndon"" than it may seem, for two reasons. Most scenes are shot with the impression of using only ""natural"" light, meaning there is no stage illumination but only lamps, Christmas lights and so on. Christmas trees are everywhere and their multicolored lights take us back to the ""rainbow"" theme, meaning the bright side of the world, under which lies the darkness of raw desire (see the models...). Secondly, Tom Cruise is used more like a mask himself than an actual man: his expressions are recurring and almost unnatural, as he tries to find his way in the labyrinth of his perceptions. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were married at the time of shooting, which reinforces the fact that Kubrick loved the interaction between reality and fiction. If in ""A Clockwork Orange"" the viewer actually goes through the Ludwig cure, here he has the opportunity of seeing unveil a crisis in a couple played by one of the most famous couples of the time. While I loved Cruise's acting, Kidman's felt a little too obvious and extreme, although I don't know how much of a fault she has in it, as Kubrick always had total control over his works.",Eyes Wide Shut
321,JoshuaMLosapio,A Beautifully Made But Imperfect Drama,8,11 October 2019,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" has a polarized reputation: some say it's one of Kubrick's best movies, others say it's one of his worst. While there's much to like about ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" I have to agree that this isn't Kubrick at his finest. The movie is beautifully shot and thoughtfully addresses compelling themes of love, lust, and marriage. I love how Kubrick essentially recreated New York City in a London studio - the setting looks so real you believe it's genuine. The overall storyline is solid and the film's most infamous scenes in a certain upstate mansion are truly unsettling. The sex in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" isn't at all pornographic: it's cold, lifeless, detached. Kubrick shows that human relationships can often appear fulfilled when in reality there's no true love to be found, and the people in those relationships will pretend otherwise thinking it will make them happy. In other words, they keep their eyes ""wide shut.""There's no doubt that Kubrick's direction is stellar and he, as always, uses the art of filmmaking to convey an important message about the human condition. But ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is also deeply flawed: there's a certain point halfway through the film where the story should clearly end, yet the movie continues aimlessly for another hour and a half. By the two hour mark ""Eyes Wide Shut"" almost becomes painful to watch due to its narrative emptiness and sluggish pace. Even in the first half the conversation scenes are extremely slow, and we only remain invested because of the movie's visual beauty and the committed performances from the central cast. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a strong final feature from Stanley Kubrick, but far from a masterpiece. 7/10.",Eyes Wide Shut

Let me first say that I completely agree that Eyes Wide Shut isn't REALLY about sexual exploration and the relationship of a couple who are having marriage issues. These are themes that have been explored way before EWS came out, and many critics jumped on the movie for not being original like most Kubrick films and beating a dead horse that had already been cinematically explored. But I think Kubrick was more intelligent than that. However, many conspiracy theorists jump on the fact that EWS is really all about cults (certainly ironic considering Cruise and Kidman's scientology ties) and how evil they are, and especially about how the Illumanti control the world and we are blind to it, with some even saying that EWS is Kubrick's warning of a new dark age to come. And blah blah blah.Me, I see the film as actually a deep complex study on our fascination with cults and conspiracy theories as a whole, and of the unknown. It is inherint that there is something creepy about what we don't understand. The mysterious is never boring. I think a lot of people attribute stuff (say, 9/11 for example) to crazy theories because a) it makes everything seem more interesting and b) because it means responsibility is never in your own hands. This works with EWS very well I think. Firstly, Cruise and Kidman are portrayed as the 'vanilla American' couple getting bored with life and each other. Again, many conspiracy theories are made by people bored with their own lives that want excitement in believing that there is a BIGGER PICTURE out there and that they are one of the lucky few to really see what is happening, while everyone else is ""sheep."" This also fits in with Cruise's intent interest to go to the party he is told about that he knows is VERY exclusive. It is exciting and different, and it is something most people don't know about.But then, secondly, is the fact that Cruise doesn't have to really take responsibility for his actions. He had drawn away from his wife, and was willing to cheat on her, but then the ""cult"" threatens his life and suddenly the issue of infidelity is MINOR when compared to the grand tragedy and mystery that he came upon. This can very much be symbolic of why such organizations have their powerfullness and mystery trumped up, and why conspiracy theories are so popular. It takes away the importance of our own actions in the big scheme of things. They can be the invisible scape goat we point to when we make our own mistakes. It's a way to gauge your own sins against far greater sins and to find absolution in this fact.Even the title, EYES WIDE SHUT, fits in this paradox. People make themselves believe they have a greater view on life than all others while really they are the most blind themselves. The ones who think ""they get it"" and that everyone else is sheep are only fooling their own hearts.I see the sun worshipping ""cult"" as a tool to further these themes and the journey the main character takes through both reality and fantasy, ego and anonymity. The real trick to it, and the trick to most of Kubrick's film, is that they are never about what you think they are about. If the film says one thing, it really means another.To me a big theme of Eyes Wide Shut is responsibility, and the importance of our own actions as OUR actions (and the contrast between your actions being part of a larger sum and belonging to you on an individual level.) The blurred line between the real and the unreal, between boring old life and the fantasy of our dreams, is also very important as well for this film, especially in the fact that sometimes we want - and need - that line to be blurred. To discover more about ourselves and who we really are, and also to discover more about life and the experiences and sensations it can offer, we can find ourselves searching out dangerous roads. These confusing paths can lead many places. They can lead to a reality where up is down, where the blind see more than anyone else, and where those who appear enlightened actually are the most sightless of all. So to speak, this is a journey where you can take each step with your eyes wide shut.",Eyes Wide Shut
325,markmuhl,The Sex Beast in Us,9,1 October 2021,"At first sight Mr. Kubrick's last movie seems to be an erotic thriller with location New York City but in fact it is rather a psychoanalytic report about the sex beast in us that is constantly knocking on our intellectual world. After all, the film is based on the 1926 novella 'Dream Story' by Arthur Schnitzler who has even been admired by Sigmund Freud for his clairvoyant character studies. After having quickly read through the synopsis of the novella I found it actually quite striking how close the script is to the original story apart from the fact that the setting was transferred from Vienna to New York City and from Mardi Gras to Christmas season.It is possible to see in the movie the denunciation of a degenerated upper-class morality, but I think it is much more about our own internal conflict when facing the strength of our libido which is in a way opposed to the moral standards that society imposes on us. Is romantic love and family bliss just an illusion?Both Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise do a good job in showing this internal conflict. Alice appears to be anything but happy when confessing to Bill her sexual phantasies with someone else but still she does so for showing Bill that his somewhat haughty self-conception is based on shaky ground. And Bill's erotic night trip through Manhattan in the very same night is just his reaction to these in his eyes shocking confessions. At the beginning it was maybe just meant to be an escape from home, but it turns more and more into an act of revenge by paying Alice back in her own coin. It fits in well that Tom Cruise usually comes across as someone quite arrogant.Overall, an exceptional movie with a high-end camera work, as we would expect it from a perfectionist like Stanley Kubrick. Reviewing may create new insights into the unconscious.",Eyes Wide Shut
326,blade-21,Contradictory impressions.,5,3 October 1999,"I am at a loss about how to describe this film. I found it fascinating and yet overly long. Is there a contradiction here somewhere? I was admittedly mesmerised by Nicole Kidman and some of the secret society scenes. At the same time the film seemed to last for ages and became boring in parts. I really can't analyse it and I suppose that the answer is ""Go and see it for yourself"". On balance its probably worth it.",Eyes Wide Shut

As he wonders New York City he has a series of strange encounters that culminates with him visiting a strange masked ball where nothing is as it seems.I went into Eyes Wide Shut without high expectations. I am a huge Kubrick fan and I knew, since he directed it, it couldn't be a complete waste of time but due to its lack of acclaim I figured it was one of his weaker efforts. I was blown away.Eyes Wide Shut is a cinematic masterpiece that, in true Kubrick fashion, can be interpreted in innumerable ways and puzzled over for hours. Eyes Wide Shut dissects everything from marriage to sexual perversion all the while containing an ominous tone that turns it into some perverse horror story. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise both give excellent career defining performances as does Sydney Pollack even with his extremely short screen time. I'm not sure why this isn't considered one of Kubrick's best. Virtually every movie he has made, including the disappointing Full Metal Jacket, are considered to be some of the greatest pictures to every grace a multiplex, yet Eyes Wide Shut was virtually ignored by critics and audiences alike. I guess most of his movies were misunderstood at the time of their release and the intense expectation everyone had coming in didn't help either, but don't be fooled. Eyes Wide Shut is an amazing achievement and one that you can watch over and over again. I have watched it five or six times now and every time I notice a few new things and discover another way you could interpret a specific scene or phrase. Trust me; Eyes Wide Shut will blow you away.",Eyes Wide Shut
328,Fredichi,Boring Pointless and Excruciatingly Slow,7,29 March 2000,"I love Kubrick. I like almost all of his films. I hated this. Most of his movies are slow paced. That is fine. They are also interesting, thought provoking, and beautiful as they unfold. This was none of these things. I wanted Nicole Kidman to drop dead. She took so long in getting out her dialogue that I swear you can use audio excerpts in a hypnosis class. I just thought this was painful to watch. There are only two movies on tape that I have come close to or have actually turned off and returned without watching the rest. This came close, but out of respect for all the pleasure Kubrick has given me as a viewer on other films I felt I should at least sit through the whole thing. I wish I hadn't. I wish I never saw this and just always thought of it as that lost Kubrick movie I never saw. Then I wouldn't know it was bad, and I wouldn't now see Kubrick as a lesser director. I have an on going theory that none of the greats can make a good movie in Hollywood anymore. Maybe I have just become jaded and good movies don't seem as good.But this was bad. Completely bad. I liked the music. That is it. Maybe it's because I don't like Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. They are both too serious for their own good. Or maybe it was all Kubrick. I do know that I have had enough of Kidman Cruise for a long time. Remember Risky Business. Remember Batman Forever. Somewhere along the way these two fooled Hollywood into thinking they could act. Instead of putting them both in a movie how about taking Cruise's smile and plastering it on Kidman's bare butt.You got the best of both of them and you don't have to listen to them talk.",Eyes Wide Shut

330,conspracy-2,Kubrick has done it again - almost,7,20 May 2000,"'Eyes Wide Shut' is a dense film. I'm not quite sure what means exactly. It's just the feeling you have after you've seen it. The atmosphere in this film is so thick, you could cut it with a knife. Even in the great halls of the ceremonial palaces, the thick atmosphere manages to fill every nook and cranny. It's incredibly engrossing.As an example, consider the scene, where Alice (Nicole Kidman) and William (Tom Cruise) are kissing in front of a mirror in the beginning of the film. Alice is looking at herself in a horny, bad girl way. The light is orange. 'Baby did a bad bad thing' is blaring in the background. It's incredible. If you've seen it, you know what I mean.Stanley Kubrick was one of the great directors. We all know this. His choice of musical score, lighting, camera angles were as effective as they were bold. Where this film fails to reach the heights of 'Dr. Strangelove','Full Metal Jacket','Clockwork Orange' and the other great Kubrick films, is in the plot. The direction is flawless. The acting, especially by Nicole Kidman, is astounding. Whenever she is in a scene, she lights up (or should I say darkens?) the film. The joint scene in particular - I never knew Kidman could actually act! (That said, Tom Cruise seems to be free-wheeling through this film).But the plot. It's mysterious and exciting, but in the end it's disappointing. Again, if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about. It sort of falls flat. You're left with a feeling that nothing really happened, that no character really grew, and that the film was just a blip in the character's lives.Ironic, really. I think Tom Cruise got a bigger story to tell from working with Stanley Kubrick on his last film, than his character in the film would have to tell about his experiences.",Eyes Wide Shut
331,mjhalta,Not even a good porn flick,1,21 July 2006,"Stanley Kubrick must not have gotten out much. If this movie was meant to somehow shock us then obviously some of us have never rented a porn flick or gone to a strip joint or had someone do a lap dance for us. The only people who would find this movie shocking or perhaps at least interesting are living in some old folks home, having been born in the 1800's. What I don't understand is how Tom Cruise would get mixed up with this loser. Maybe he was anticipating his coming divorce and wanted to stock up on money for the settlement. After such an outstanding career it's a shame that this Dud will be remembered as Kubrick's last movie. People should get better at their craft not reach rock bottom with their last effort.",Eyes Wide Shut

333,stefan-144,"Nothing much, in beautiful wrapping",5,15 January 2003,"It's a pity that this became Kubrick's last movie. Some artists seem to know when their time is up, and hurry to make sort of an artistic testament - like Dostoevsky in the last 50 or so pages of Brothers Karamazov. I gather that Kubrick did not have such a premonition, or he just felt that there was not much to add to his fabulous suite of movies.This one is a long series of beautiful sceneries, and beautiful people parading, but there's really not much happening. Not much to be shocked about, either. Tom Cruise's character is bewildered to find a secret group committed to rituals of a frank but also quite conventional sexual nature. Why would that be so unsettling? He is also perplexed to learn that his wife has fantasies of unfaithfulness, and more so to find that he can have them, too. Huh?I guess the movie would have been much more interesting, if instead we had been following Nicole Kidman, playing his wife, on similar adventures. Since she was more at ease with those thirsts within herself, the development would no doubt have been more interesting. Kidman also handles her role with much more delicacy, enriching it, while Cruise mainly stands around looking stiff - well, the script might not have given him much else to do.This whole film would have been much better off, if directed by Fellini. He would have known to go beyond the middle class morality, and fill the scenes with such stuff as of which dreams are really woven.",Eyes Wide Shut
334,mjensen-3,"""I miss Kubrick""",9,15 August 2004,"""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Lolita"",""A Clockwork Orange"", these classics were ahead of there time, now these movies are being hailed as the best of Kubrick's films.  ""Eye's Wide Shut"" was Kubrick's last film, he took a chance and has made a film that is in it's own class, and has created a dark yet clever film.THE PLOTA doctor (Tom Cruise) who is married to an artist, finds out that she almost cheated on him, then he goes on an odyssey of sex and murder.When I first heard of Stanley Kubrick's latest film, I was expecting a sexual, cinematic film. But then I saw the film, and I was dissapointed with the darkness, the acting, and the orgy scene. Well if that's an orgy, I don't want to be in one. It was scary. I didn't like the film at first, but then I saw it two more times, and I began to think, can sex drive people to murder.2001: A Space Odyssey I looked at all of Kubrick's films before I saw ""Eye's Wide Shut"", and I realized that he's the kind of director that show's the dark, inmoral side of human being's,  so I decided this is an instant Kubrick classic. However, Kubrick  does demonstrate hope in some of his films. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is one of the best films of the 20th century.  As I remembered the ending, that showed a man being reborn in space as a baby, it brought tears in my eye's.A CLOCKWORK ORANGEThis is another good film by Kubrick. It's about a man who is a rapist, and a killer. But when he's arrested, they put him through a treatment that will change his whole life. When the treatment is over, one of consequences of it is that he realizes that every time he throws up, he is  thinking of sex with women. He curses, and tries to be violent but it is impossible. The ending shows  that he has  had some redemption, but maybe he didn't really learn anything.FULL METAL JACKETThe action is savage, and this is a superb film. The ensemble cast falls into action in Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War that shows the horrible process that turns people into killers. ""Full Metal Jacket"", from its basic training to its nightmare of combat in Hue City, scores a cinematic direct hit.I love ""Eye's Wide Shut."" I give it ****(out of 4 stars)",Eyes Wide Shut
335,Board,Like so many other films....Nothing special,4,14 November 2002,"I think this movie had the potential of being good, but didn't succeed at it - at least not for me. When Tom Cruise visited the house with all the people it started getting good, but then it went downhill again (instead of uphill). We was never told what was so dangerous about that house party, we never was told who the people were and we was never told what was the deal with Nicole Kidman and her involvement in all this. Of course there may be something for us to figure out for ourselves in movies, but this had to many loose ends in my opinion, to make it to hard to figure it out and just made it a movie where you just said ""Nah, I couldn't really say if it was good or bad, as it had too many loose ends"". It's not like it was completely crazy and weird like ""Lost highway"" for instance, but it just a bit boring and instead of building up to big climax it kind of faded out a whole hour! It also lasted almost 3 hours, so it was too long to use on a film like this in my opinion. I don't mind long films if they're good, but this was as I said just a film where I said ""Nothing special"", which for me basically is a waste of time.",Eyes Wide Shut
336,chadlund,Did I miss something or is there no story ?,1,8 December 2016,"Bill Harford is a young doctor, who ventures out of his luxurious apartment on the Park, into the decrepit neighborhood,after his beautiful wife Alice, admitted to him she fantasizes to cheat him with another man. His quest for sexual encounters leads him to a troubling experience that could cost him more than his vertu. At the beginning I didn't think much about this movie, I figured that Alice would be the focus of the movie as she fantasizes about having sex with another man. So naturally I was expecting her to initiate herself and her husband to new sexual experiences. Instead she's one-dimensional and plays an uninteresting person with silly lines. The movie lingers on and on, Harford wanders in the streets and then decides to hook up with a prostitute at her apartment until his wife calls him. Then he decides to leave and check into the club where an old college friend ( Nick Nightingale ) plays, which of course was 25 yards away. So basically Nick reveals that he is hired to play blind-folded at a very private party and commits the rookie mistake to give him the address of the party. It's a costumed party, and Harford manages to buy late-night a costume and get there a little late with a cloak and a mask. There, he is welcomed by a fleet of staff, in front of a grandiose house- all of them are men by the way. He discovers it's an orgie and we ask ourselves: why and what exactly does Kubrick want to share to us about this exaggerated baroque orgie ? Maybe that the bourgeois have the means to create their sexual opera ? The struggle of hedonism ? The consequences of desire ? The inanity of passions ? The quest for liberties over a conquest ? There is nothing spectacular about even the orgie - believe it or not there are already clubs who provide these kinds of sexual orientations. Kubrick clearly committed a mistake of ignorance. Harford does not participate in any activities, he has been spotted as an intruder. A hooker urges him to leave the party before he can be identified. A whole twisted staged plot encircles Harford who is threatened to stay shut. We then ask ourselves again: what is the big deal about this orgie ? Is this party worth the secrecy of identity ? But after that the movie fails to develop the climax. Harford reads in the newspaper about a prostitute who overdosed early in the morning. He is convinced that he is being the center of a hit ? That's not a sufficient intrigue.The movie then ends in a confrontation between Victor, an older friend of Bill. Victor was there that night at the house. The outcome is greatly disappointing. All evolves around the secrecy of this orgie, the extreme measures that have been taken to protect the fetichism of the wealthiest corny men in New York. Yes, rich men like to hire escorts for their kinky fantasies, it is not tabou, it is everyday in the newspapers after another scandal surfaces. It's all shortcuts, incoherences. How does a pianist who just moved in N.Y., gets contacted to play at this orgie ? How did he get contacted in the first place ? How many times has he been there ? Why would an outsider recommend a pianist to people who have to means to hire 30 staff employees ? Are you telling me they can't hire themselves a pianist ? The quest for sexual identity seems to be the subject of the movie but really the characters mistake themselves on their own identity. Since they do not know what they want, they convince themselves they are seeking sexual experiences, in order to have a purpose. All seem to enjoy the idea of fantasizing and playing, and that is why Bill follows a hooker to her place (which he never touches) and amuses on adultery. For a movie that apparently wants to shock or excite, it massively fails.",Eyes Wide Shut

338,eyecandyforu,The title says it all...,10,11 March 2010,"Eyes Wide Shut remains one of those films that when I mention it to people, I inevitably get eye rolls and OMGs. It's weirdness seems to overpower it, causing what I like to call ""The Art-house Effect"". Many expect a mainstream film; this if far from one. Many viewers no doubt expected a film that would titillate and shock. It does do both of these things but they take a far backseat. For all it's convolution and confusion, the story is very simple. A man travels by night across Manhattan and Long Island at Christmas. During this all-nighter he has many strange adventures and is subjected to temptations. In the light of the next day, he is shown how wrong he was about his perceptions. If this reminds you of A Christmas Carol, then congratulations because you would be right. This film could be rightly called a very adult Carol. It also suggests legends and myths where the ""hero"" is tested by his encounters and found to be worthy.Kubrick was a film genius. He doesn't care if we ""don't get it"", he never has. Most of his films have been received as being difficult to understand, yet later they somehow achieve clarity. It's as though we catch up to him after a few years. His lighting in this is especially sublime, ""pushing"" the exposure a few extra stops so that ambient light, (candles, table lamps, Christmas lights) is plenty of light. This makes the goings on dark and dreamlike. Further enhancing this unreal atmosphere are supposedly outdoor street scenes, which look artificial to the extreme. Look at the streets the next time you watch this, they look pristine, impossibly perfect. My only severe criticism of this film is the casting of Cruise and Kidman. A Superceleb couple at the time of filming, IMHO they are horribly miscast. Cruise projects very little presence, I wondered why anyone bothered to interact with him to the degree they do. Kidman pretty much started her Ice Queen period here, despite a playful character, she is distant. Their looks only go so far in this. There's the feeling of rebelliousness by both of them, as though they are fighting against the rest of the film. It's a testament to Kubrick's masterful hand that the film transcends this miscasting, under another director it might have ruined it. This film is magic. A fairy tale for grown ups. It's message is clear and echoed throughout the film by the password for entry to the party. Without trust and honesty in relationships, we are lost.",Eyes Wide Shut
339,grantbullert,Thought-Provoking and Haunting,8,7 October 2018,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a slow-burn drama/thriller with deep themes that bring about many questions. It brings to light a discussion that needs to be had.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The drama plays out beautifully in this film. It begins by introducing a deep concept that nearly everyone deals with: wondering what it would be like to be with someone else. What follows is a horrifying venture. Kubrick once again takes command of the audience's attention and brings to light a darker side of the elite and the human psyche in general. *Cinematography/Editing: The tone and camerawork of the film is very recognizable as being a Kubrick film. Larry Smith does a fantastic job of bringing the film a dreamlike quality in visual terms. This sets up an important part of the narrative because much of it deals with dreams and how they affect us more than we may think. The editing is a bit of a weak point in the film. There was apparently quite a bit of studio interference with this film so it is very likely that the final cut is not exactly what Kubrick had intended. While there are a few pacing issues, most of the film is top quality. *Dialogue/Acting: The stumbling dialogue between characters is a brilliant touch to this film. It feels authentic and natural. Bill tries to cover up what he has done, and he is very awkward about it. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman do a phenomenal job portraying a couple who is struggling to deal with feelings of attraction to other people. The supporting actors all make this film come together. There are some strong performances by the members of the elite during the ritual scenes. *Music/Sound: The music is haunting in this film when it needs to be. It adds to the feeling of anxiety created by the situations Bill puts himself in. The sound is designed well and feels authentic. It is especially effective during the ritual scene. The soundscape feels very eerie during that moment. *Production Design/Special Effects: The costume and set pieces are grand and add to the feeling of the wealth that all of the characters have.*Conclusion: ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a beautiful and gut-wrenching film that brings to light the evils of the elite and shows us the importance of needing to address feelings of unfaithfulness in our own relationships. Are dreams really just dreams?",Eyes Wide Shut
340,claybo76,A Film That Keeps It's Mystery,8,15 June 2000,"An excellent film, and very Kubrickesque. Lots of the brilliant director's classic trademarks are in here: the deliberate pacing, zooms, the angle of the close-ups, etc, etc.  What I loved most about this film was that you weren't given a clear-cut answer to anything.  The house, Nick, Mandy, the dream, you could make of it what you wanted. Maybe that's why so many people didn't get it, because they needed it spelt out and spoon fed to them. 
I have been waiting for a new Kubrick film for years. Funnily enough the first film of his I saw was 1987's Full Metal Jacket, which I rate as one of his best.  I loved EWS.  It was everything I hoped it would be.  Well acted, well directed, well written and well shot.  I will never look at a mask again without getting goosebumps.

342,DC1977,Much Ado About Nothing,3,6 August 1999,"Stanley Kubrick's last film was one of the most eagerly awaited and mysterious movies ever made. Ever since 1996, film fans have been waiting for the ""master's"" final film to make it to the big screen. Although, Kubrick had other projects in mind, it was obvious that with the huge gap between each film that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" would be the final chapter to his career.Kubrick had stated that this was his best film and the two stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, both said that they were blown away by the film when they first saw it. The only reason I can think of that can explain this is that the three of them were involved in this project for so long that they had convinced themselves that they were making a masterpiece.Since ""Barry Lyndon (1975)"", Kubrick's films have not matched the quality of his earlier masterworks and unfortunately, Kubrick has finished his career with his weakest and most obviously flawed film.After an intriguing and very stylish opening, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" simply loses all it's direction. After coming home from a high-society gathering from which both Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice, have spent most the evening flirting, Alice tells her husband of a fantasy she once had about a man she saw, telling William that she would have given up everything, her marriage included, in order to fulfil that fantasy. This fairly unlikely and irrelevant anecdote, told with Alice's intention of keeping her husband from being over-confident about her marital fidelity, leads Dr. Harford on a bizarre and totally unbelievable walk through the streets of New York and into a sexual underworld where he himself has the opportunity to fulfil his own fantasies. A promising beginning to the movie disintegrates into an aimless and seemingly improvised story with many unnecessary scenes (Cruise's character seems to spend an eternity getting a costume for a mysterious and potentially dangerous sex orgy). Dr. Harford simply wanders from one weird character to another as the story becomes more ridiculous with a totally implausible explanation of it all being tacked on at the end. Also, the final piece of dialogue was probably one of the first things to have been written as it simply doesn't belong with what has happened before but seems to have been put there because it sounds clever and witty.However, this IS a Kubrick film and anyone with any interest in films should see it purely for that reason. However, many people will be disappointed because Kubrick's movies are eulogised simply because he made them, ""Jingle All the Way"" would be acclaimed as a complex and thought-provoking masterpiece if Kubrick's name been attached to the credits.Stanley Kubrick was one of the greatest and most naturally gifted directors of all time but unfortunately as he became more obsessive about the making of his films he seemed to lose the ability to judge whether his projects actually had a good story.Here we have a great director working meticulously at a boring film, it's a pity he couldn't have finished on a higher note.",Eyes Wide Shut

345,Flinx-2,Better than the Hype,9,18 July 1999,"Let me start by admitting to being an unabashed Kubrick fan,  from ""The Killing"" to ""Full Metal Jacket"" and everything in between.  That said, I was a little apprehensive about ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  Would Tom and Nicole overshadow their direction?  Would the story be all about the sex, leaving no room for anything else?  Not to worry.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" delivers, outdoing all the hype and hoopla surrounding its release.  The chills are genuine, and Nicole turns in a devastating performance that is the heart of the film, despite a lack of screen time in the middle.  The pacing is a bit deliberate, and fans of shoot-em-up, ""Armageddon"" clones will undoubtedly leave the theatre shaking their heads.  But anyone interested in a good psychological thriller and unoffended by a plethora of nudity and symbolism will undoubtedly find ""Eyes Wide Shut"" a fascinating excursion.",Eyes Wide Shut
346,a-jacke,Thge master of cinema pushed a great actress,10,11 May 2005,"Everybody knows that Kubrik is the one of the great masters in the history of cinema. And his last film is a great final and nothing else.With this film, I would say the acting of Kidman have to become another dimension. What Jane Champion or Gus van Saint never have shown Kubriks show us from her in 10 minutes. The dialog between Kidman and Cruise after they have smoke a joint is so real and important that much of my friends tell me that they were angry about her in this scene. ""She is searching a conflict"" they say. But it is the truth??? I think that it is not the problem. The problem is that her husband in this film and with him many people don't understand anything of her fantasies. Or they don't want understand. I think what the wife is saying in this scene to her husband is not a provocation - it's a real problem for her, too.With her fantasies his jealous run begin - the motivation for the complete film is given and Kubrik also as Schnitzler make a story about a man. But in the beginning and again in the end in this film the scenes with Kidman are so good that here at the first time everybody can see how much she can.Here and before in ""Portrait of a young lady"" in the end slumbers fill her eyes - and the tragic dimension of life become the result of it all. They details of it you must see by yourself, but never forget that they stopping of this fantasies is impossible.

Floating tracking shots, lush costumes, colours, images and performances, grace the screen in Kubricks big Arovour film.Cruise plays Dr. William Harford, who becomes ensnared in a dangerous erotic foray after his wife (kidman) admits sexual longings. Harford spends a long night on the town, plunging deeper into doubt, fear, self discovery and eventually a sexual rabbit hole.The picture is drenched in nudity, mostly unnecessary and degrading to the actors, Also the film is slightly too long, and so it loses its punch slightly by its second viewing.

It is truly unforgettable,and refuses to leave your head. The acting is incredible, the scenes with Kidman and Cruise are priceless. The moments of fear and surprise are hard to forget. Its really a film about secrets and mysterious things. Characters do things that are unexpected, and ultimately, they pay for it. It shows how one mistake can lead to an even bigger mistake. The twists are well crafted and the dialouge is highly impressive. Masterful directing, rich colors, and a great score. Both actors prove just how much they can become their characters. And the ending hits you and you'll like ""wow""! this is a new masterpiece. artsy and risqué.

Unfortunately, this is about as bad as 2001: A Space Odyssey.When this came out, I was relatively excited.  I thought that Kubrick was going to pull out all the stops in his last film, that it was going to top everything else he ever did.  I was very, very disappointed.The only way I can really see this movie is an excuse to film a bunch of naked people.  And since nudity never advances any plot points or gives us deep insight into a character's soul, filming 200 naked people seems pointless (unless you just wanted to catch a porn movie starring Tom Cruise, because that's all this is).  If this sounds like the perfect way to spend a few hours, watch it.  I'll just check Dr. Stangelove out again.",Eyes Wide Shut

Though they have been married for a long period, Dr.Hartford suspects that his wife has been cheating on him for someone. After finding that She gets seduced by an old Hungarian at a party thrown by Victor. Parker gets upset with his wife and realizes that his marriage is under threat. He subsequently treats a woman named Mandy and goes after her friend, a hooker named Domino. Before he has sexual urges, he controls himself and leaves Domino paying her fees. Meanwhile, Bill learns from one of his friends whom he met at the party at Victor's mansion that there will be a cult ritual held in secrecy at an estate located in the suburbs. He tells Bill that there is a password and a dress code to be followed for the party. Nick also tells that he'd be the pianist at that cult ritual and there will be many options for sexual encounters there. Bill realizes that his wife had craved for the body of a young naval officer during one of their holidays and decides to attend the cult ritual cum orgy. He acquaints himself with a costume designer Mr. Milich and asks for his help with the costume for the party. Mr.Milich accepts the deal for an extra $200 on the actual rental price. Bill also sees Mr.Milich's daughter cheating on two men. Bill borrows the costume and takes a taxi to the secret location of the party. He reaches the location and gives the password to the security at the gates and gets access inside the premise. The cult leader does a sinister looking orgy and directs the ladies to pair up with one of the male guests at the end of the ritual. Bill gets paired with one of the masked girls who strongly advises that he takes leave with immediate effect. Bill confused on what to do decides to inquire her. Before anything could turn over, the butler comes with a message for Bill leading him to another chamber where the guests and the cult leader were seen. The cult leader asks bill for the secondary password which Bill couldn't produce. The cult leader asks Bill to remove his clothing and stand naked for infiltrating their ritual. Before anything could pan out, the woman who had earlier warned Bill accepts the blame on herself and saves Bill. Bill gets relieved with a stern warning that he must never talk to anyone about this secret society or make any inquiry about its existence. Bill goes to his wife who narrates her nightmare to him. While returning the costume to Mr.Milich, Bill misplaces the mask that he borrowed from him and ends up paying a $25 penalty. Bill then goes after the Pianist at his hotel room. The receptionist reveals that Nick had been seen leaving the hotel very early in the morning with two men and with bruises on his face. Bill then goes to meet Domino for inquiries but Domino is nowhere to be found and instead her friend Sally tells him that She had left town for her own good. He also tries snooping around the mansion where the ritual took place but he gets a strong warning that his inquiries be stopped if at all he values his life. Bill then reads news that a girl had died due to drug overdose the same day he attended the party. He goes to the hospital where She was treated and learns that She had been shifted to the morgue. Bill goes to the morgue and finds that the girl was none other than Mandy who was the mystery woman who saved him from the cultists. Bill, disappointed leaves the morgue and goes to Victor's place who reveals to him that he saw him at the orgy and the whole orgy was scripted. He tells him that Mandy was not killed at the orgy but instead she died later as a result of drug overdose. He also assures him that Nick is safe at an undisclosed location with his family and the whole point of asking a second password was to threaten him but not harm him. Bill leaves the Victor mansion and goes to his wife, he is shocked to find that the mask that he borrowed from Mr.Milich placed near his wife's bed.

But the last one does not necessarily mean it is a good one.This film is too inconsistent to be a good one.Although there are few moments here and there sparked.  Overall, it is like a three-day-old French bread - dry and stale. The movie is too long for such a thin story.  Actors  either spoke in a unusual slow pace or kept repeating questions being asked.  The cinematography is dingy and grainy (for no obvious reason). The music sucks (same as Pollack's acting). The opening and closing credits looked like a last minute thought. And how many times that Cruise needs to tell people that he is a DOCTOR to get some attention?And, too much unnecessary exploitation of female nudity!  (how come male actors didn't get their fair share?). One gay character, pathetic and extremely stereotyped. Based on these bias. Kubrick expects me to buy his view of human feelings, love, desires, sexuality, and marriage? I think not.He might used to be a brilliant film maker. But this one is anything but a pretty swan song from Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut
354,chicklet-2,oh my God,1,25 July 1999,"Before I start, my apologies to the memory of Stanley Kubrick.  I truly enjoyed his work especially the Clockwork Orange.  However, his last work, Eyes Wide Shut, has to be one of if not the worst movie I have ever seen. It dragged horribly.  There were times when you could have driven a mack truck through the dialogue.  It was uninteresting.  I knew how it would end ten minutes into it, and I desperately wanted to walk out on it at that minute but remained in the hope that there would be a surprise or a turn around.  There wasn't.  The question that kept running through my mind while hating this movie was, ""How many people can come on to Tom Cruise in one movie?""  Every ten minutes someone is trying to get in this man's pants, two women at once, a woman who had just lost her father who lay dead in the bed next to her and Cruise as she professes her undying love, a man, and a few women in the orgy scene.  Don't get me wrong, Cruise is beautiful but please cut us all a break especially since all he is in this film is pretty.  His acting left very much to be desired, but that's really nothing new.  He has his shining moments (Interview with a Vampire, Jerry Maguire, Born on the Fourth of July) but mostly he's trite.  His wife, Nicole Kidman, was the true disappointment of this movie.  Her American accent was dead on but everything else felt very forced.  She did not become her character for one second in this film, and after her performance in To Die For we know that she can if she wants to.  Perhaps she refused to do so, I know I wouldn't want to be her.  About her I continued to wonder how often a person can say fuck in one movie, or even one sentence.  Her use of the word approached ludicrous proportions.  The positives of the film all came from the directing and lighting choices.  They effectively created the eerie atmosphere the movie demanded, but the acting and script shot all of that straight to hell.  Don't see this film.",Eyes Wide Shut
355,barfly99,"A very good film, although only an average Kubrick film",8,23 April 2000,"Of course people compare this to Kubrick's earlier work, and dwell on his past reputation - the man was an undisputed genius! That doesn't mean the faults of this film should be overlooked, and nor were they, as I recall, by the critics or the public upon its theatrical release. Yes, it is overlong, slow, and at times rather pompous. Alice is so unpleasant that you wonder what on earth nice Dr Bill would see in her. And the incorporation of the thriller element into the plot is sometimes rather unconvincing. But the cinematography IS amazing (though its impact much diminished on the small screen), the orgy scene at the very least memorable, and Cruise's performance outstanding. And of course the funny bits are supposed to be funny! (Could the scene with Cruise and the hotel clerk POSSIBLY be intended otherwise?)

356,Pinback-4,Strange but well worth watching.,8,3 August 1999,"Kubrick's final film is a mesmerizing odyssey consisting of dreamlike images.  It was also not what I expected.  I was very surprised that a huge star like Tom Cruise agreed to do this film, because there is nothing at all commercial or mainstream about it--it is an arthouse film from beginning to end.  In fact, if it had been any director other than Kubrick, I'm sure he would've turned it down.  I'm glad he did it, though, because I was getting tired of his clean-cut crusader roles he's played throughout the '90's. This is his first difficult part since ""Born on the Fourth of July"".  The story takes place in New York City, even though, of course, it was shot in England.  The photography, by Larry Smith, is outstanding.  This is Kubrick's most beautifully shot film other than ""Barry Lyndon"".  Since the film is set during the Christmas holidays, there is great use of color throughout, especially from the numerous Christmas trees we see in just about every indoor location.  No wonder this film took forever to shoot. The story of the film isn't of great importance--what is important is the atmosphere, especially the amazingly surreal sequence at the mansion, which is the film's centerpiece.  There are darkly funny moments scattered throughout.  Although the film is long at some 2 hours, 40 minutes, it felt about a half hour shorter.  Like all of Kubrick's films, it's never boring, but many mainstream moviegoers will no doubt think so, especially Tom Cruise fans.  I was angry that the film was altered for American release but that the rest of the world gets to see the original version.  Let's hope DVD will set the record straight.",Eyes Wide Shut
357,Oblomov-2,Grossly underestimated and typically Kubrikian masterpiece,9,4 October 2005,"Just after we watched ""Eyes Wide Shut"" a few years ago, I told my wife that it was very much a ""man's movie"". This is not intended to be a sexist comment, but I believe that in order to appreciate the several typically Kubrikian nuances in the film, one has to watch it through Tom Cruise's eyes and one can only do this effectively if one is a man....like Cruise. With Kubrick, the sum of the parts does not always make an effective whole, but it somehow does so in this film. The direction is very much ""in the face"" as it always is with Kubrick and the various supporting characters - like the shopowner's nubile Lolita-like daughter - somehow convey a hidden message that is for receptive ears only. But to my mind, the best scene in the film is the early morning street sequence after the party where Cruise realises that he is being followed by the bald man. There is a hidden menace in the air that can only be appreciated if you put yourself in Cruise's shoes. For this and several other sequences, this is a very unusual film that needs to be seen and enjoyed in the right mood, preferably on one's own.",Eyes Wide Shut

I think Mr. Kubrick may have begun to believe his own hype.The casting was terrible.  I didn't care about either of the characters, I was hoping a terrible accident would befall them to cut the film short, but unluckily for me it ground on relentlessly for ages going nowhere.

Making Mr. and (the then) Mrs. Tom Cruise as the leads just didn't make it seem that much better, either....  Don't get me wrong, both Tom and Nicole are good performers in their own right, but this movie just doesn't seem to do much with either of them....  Their on screen chemistry seems lost in this epic....  Seemingly off from their chemistry in 'Days of Thunder'....Tom's role as Dr. Bill just comes across as extremely wooden - not up to his usual caliber...  It's almost as off as some of his scenes from 'Risky Business'....  About his only lively moments are against the gay seeming hotel desk clerk (played by out actor, Alan Cumming) and the scene with the hooker's room mate - delivering the box of pastries....  Actually, that scene again brings to mind the Joel Goodson character of 'Risky Business'.Nicole does well in her role as Mrs. Dr. Bill, but again, just seems a bit...  off....  Her take as Virginia Woolf in 'The Hours' was top notch, and she did well in 'Moulin Rouge'....  And, as the ghost that's not a ghost in 'The Others', she was so much better...  But in this she just seems .. off....  I've seen both of them do SO much better in the past....About the only aspect of the film that really works so well, is the soundtrack....  The simplistic piano tappings - raising and lowering in tone and in tempo add certain intrigues to the scenes in which they're used... although sometimes horribly over used....The scene's at the mansion sex party are surreal - to say the least... very dramatic and intriguing....  the costumes are excellent, with gorgeously crafted masks donning so many extras.....  And the scenes with Mr. Milich (?) - at the costume shop - alternate between humorous and horrifying....And, yes, I know that Mr. Kubrick was a brilliant man - phenomenal in many other ways....  However, I just found this movie slow and not really all that great.  I gave it a 5 out of 10 - not bad but not great, either... This whole film just seems off.....",Eyes Wide Shut

361,cathcacr,Really a heck of a movie,9,6 March 2002,"This is not your ordinary movie.  If I told you the meaning underlying it all -- and I'm not going to -- you wouldn't sleep so well.  If you're searching for answers, the note slipped to Bill at the front gate of Somerton tells you all you need to know: ""Give up your inquiries which are completely useless, and consider these words a second warning.  We hope, for your own good, this will be sufficient.""  If you've just seen it a first time and are trying to find answers, you've been way out of your depth the last two-and-a-half hours.Okay, enough with the games.  Seriously now: this movie is quite extraordinary, and it comes as no big surprise that Stanley Kubrick was rumored to have considered this his best movie.  It would certainly be hard to top _2001: A Space Odyssey_, but the movies definitely have a couple things in common: (1) They both play intensely on ambiguity, driving away many a viewer; (2) Reviled so roundly at the time of their release, they did or will both come to be widely regarded as cinematic masterpieces, groundbreaking filmmaking, and classics.  On the basis of visual appearance alone -- and we're not just talking here about all the beautiful women that appear in the film -- the film is tantalizing and rivals any of Kubrick's best along these lines (notably _Barry Lyndon_), enough so to grant some level of credence to the above-mentioned rumor.On a first viewing of the film, there's nothing particularly extraordinary about the movie on its surface, save for the orgy sequence (notoriously edited in a chicken-salad fashion to satisfy the MPAA's arbitrary-applied standards).  And, really, what you get up front is a fairly standard Hollywood-type ""mystery thriller"" infused with hokey scenes and dialogue. It's only when you take a further look at this film and try to analyze it in terms we can rationally understand, that things really begin to unravel. The reaction to this by many will be, ""Well, then it's just a piece of junk.""  But that would be to miss the whole point of what Kubrick was trying to do with this film.  (At least I think I have some idea of what he was trying to do with the film.)  There is plenty of good reason to think that what Kubrick wanted is a movie that DIDN'T hold together when things try to be explained.  There is a very good reason that ambiguity and bafflement set in when you truly question what the heck you're seeing in front of you.  I don't think it's any mistake that the movie is titled as it is.One visual cue to note -- and this is one over and above the rich visual tapestry contained throughout the film -- is the character of the film stock itself.  The warm glow given off by the lights throughout is accentuated because of the way the film stock (the celluloid itself of whatever material they use now) was developed in such a way as to give a very slight haze to everything every moment of the movie.  What was somewhat all-too-obvious in a famous scene from Alfred Hitchcock's _Vertigo_ is now used in a very subtle manner throughout the whole of _Eyes Wide Shut_.  That the whole of the movie is infused throughout by this subtle hint of unreality is just the first clue as to what the heck is going on.  Some reviewers have mentioned how the movie could use a good dose of David Lynch's filmmaking technique, but that misses the point: the unreality or ambiguity or duality of things is all-too-apparent right on the surface of his films.  With _Eyes Wide Shut_, to make it readily apparent would destroy the point._Eyes Wide Shut_ carries with it a chief virtue of a film: it invites endless wonderment, thought, reflection, etc.  The richly layered meanings, non-meanings, invitations to further inquiry, the seeming contradiction of so much of it, is both frustrating and fascinating.  After several viewings of this film, on and off for about a year now, I won't look at movies the same way again (this goes for Kubrick's other movies as well).  A movie that has the power to change the way you look at film is a rare movie, indeed.",Eyes Wide Shut
362,stefanbe,Stanley Kubrick left behind a treasury of classics and Eyes Wide Shut most certainly ranks among his best.,10,12 December 2007,"Stanley Kubrick began his career as a teenage photographer and finished it as a maverick filmmaker. The transition from a young Brooklyn kid to one of the greatest directors in the history of film is an impressive one and rather evident in plenty of his films. Kubrick always knew how to frame a shot, ever since he began taking pictures as a boy. In each of his films, the camera was placed perfectly, creating superb picture after picture. Kubrick was not just a filmmaker, he was an artist. Many years from now, his films will be looked at the same way the paint strokes of Goya or the music of Mozart are analysed today. To cap off his incredibly consistent career, the reclusive Kubrick made his first film in twelve years and one of his best. Eyes Wide Shut is a film that is hard to classify into one genre, as its unique cinematic experience brings something different never experienced before. Kubrick would continually re-invent film with such masterpieces like Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange and most importantly 2001: A Space Odyssey, his magnum opus. Eyes Wide Shut may unfortunately be Kubrick's final film, but thankfully he left the world with a bang and not a whimper.Like all of Stanley Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is a piece of work that gets better with multiple viewings and more is noticed with each look. Not surprisingly, there is still plenty left un-explained and like a detective story, the viewer has to unravel clues much like the main protagonist does. Yet, before Harford turns into Sherlock Holmes, he represents a modern version of Odysseus from Homer's The Odyssey. Throughout the film, he is confronted by individuals wishing to give him sexual pleasure, yet he avoids them much like Odysseus and his encounter with the sirens. Similar to that character, turning down the various characters turned out to be fortunate for him. During his dreamy walk through New York, Harford encounters a prostitute who he kisses but eventually does not sleep with. The next morning, he finds out that she is HIV-positive. His decision to not have sex with her turns out to be a good one as he does not receive the deadly disease. He also turns down the offer of a patient of his and despite his sexuality being questioned by a group of rowdy teenagers (thus leading to the encounter with the prostitute), he still does not cheat on his wife. Her words may have caused jealousy, yet he actually ends up being a more noble character than Alice. With Harford as his main protagonist, Kubrick actually brought upon a rare personality that for him was un-explored. Harford has his flaws, but he is actually the most sane character of the film and the least demonic. Tom Cruise's performance also helps the audience be with the character as goes on his journey. He gives life to Harford and fleshes him out into a human being with feelings and emotions. Cruise is an accomplished actor and he hits the right keys, not going over-the-top and not being too drone-like. It is a subtle performance from one of Hollywood's biggest stars.Stanley Kubrick would always give his female leads as much as heart-ache as his lead male actors. Most of the time he managed to bring forth a great performance as evidenced by Marisa Berenson in Barry Lyndon and Sue Lyon in Lolita. In the case of Shelley Duvall in The Shining, there was the opposite effect. Thankfully, Nicole Kidman's work in Eyes Wide Shut proves to be an outstanding performance, bringing forth a character whose dark side is shown even when she's just glancing towards the camera (a frequent Kubrick trademark). Her character is not on screen as much as Cruise is, but when she does show up on camera, she excels. Most of Alice's dialogue consists of monologues, each showing the character's rough edges easily. Kidman perfectly brings layer upon layer on the character. Even in Harford's frequent fantasies, there is something sinister and careless told about her. The most fascinating scene of Kidman's comes when she is high on drugs and reveals her sensual theories to her husband. The combination of Cruise and Kidman starts the scene, but she soon takes over silencing not just Harford but the viewer as well.Another possibly sinister character with something to hide is done very well with Sydney Pollack. As soon as he is shown in a bathroom with an over-dosed and naked girl, the audience knows that this man has a couple of skeletons in his closet. When he reveals to Harford some information regarding both the cult and the naked girl, both Harford and the viewer aren't quite sure whether to trust him or not. It's not just the screenplay that leads us to believe this, but Pollack's performance as well. That final scene either produces plenty of information or makes people more confused about the past two hours than they were before. He says the whole orgy cult was done to scare Harford, yet why would they go through all the trouble to do all that? Harford is suspicious and so are we.Kubrick only follows that sequence up with a final confrontation between Bill and Alice. In these culminating scenes, Alice states that ""only as sure as I am that the reality of one night, let alone that of a whole lifetime, can ever be the whole truth."" All of this goes back to the film's title. Are Harford's eyes wide shut? Or could it be Alice or even the pianist? How about Sydney Pollack's character? For all we know, it could even be Kubrick himself as the director certainly did work in mysterious ways. It is rumoured that long-gone rapper Tupac hinted in his songs about his eventual death. Could it be that Kubrick wanted to give us one last hint about him in this film? Maybe.",Eyes Wide Shut

While I am more enamored of his less artistic works to begin with, such as ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"", this movie didn't even meet the levels of ""2001"".One of the best parts of most of Kubrick's work is that he keeps you enraptured throughout his films, never taking your eyes off the screen. Not so here. The first 45 minutes seem to stretch on endlessly. Nicole Kidman, especially, is simply playing a bad character. She isn't so much the wife on the protagonist, Tom Cruise's Dr. Bill Hartford, as much as she's another aspect of the libido we explore throughout the film. This is symbolized ad nauseam, mainly in the fact that Kidman takes about 30 seconds between every word she speaks, so as to give the impression of a far off angel, I suppose.There are some good spots, when Cruise's character hits the street. Vinessa Shaw, a lady of the street, and Todd Field, an old friend who shows him another world of sorts, are very good. There are some moments that make you sit up and say ""Wow"", the kind of thing only Stanley Kubrick can do. The problem here is that Kubrick tries to inject too many of those moments into his film, instead of letting them come naturally, and it doesn't have the same effect. All in all, this isn't a bad movie, but not as good as you might expect given some of the names working on out. There is layer upon layer of symbolism and insight, and sometimes it crashes upon itself, and you're left wondering what exactly Kubrick was aiming for with certain scenes. The movie is worth seeing, but don't go in with your expectations too high, especially if you're familiar with some of Kubrick's earlier works.",Eyes Wide Shut
366,GenK1981,Typically Kubrick!,9,3 January 2002,"When i first saw this film i didn't know wether to like it or hate it, so that is why i decided to watch it again.  In all honesty i'm not the greatest Kubrick Fan....but i do like his style sometimes.Full Metal Jacket really didn't have enough grip of the audience to convince me and the 2nd half of A clockwork orange dissappointed to a much superior first half of the film!  Its only 2001: SO that stood out as the only film i liked.Eyes Wide Shut finds Bill (Cruise) and Alice (Kidman) who are experiencing a rough patch to there relationship when Alice explains her erotic dreams. Bill then go's on a journey through mystery where he meets suspicious characters and finds himself at a Party that he would never forget.The atmosphere is typically Kubrick with the lavish suspence and the slow tense music score....with every character Bill meets you know theres something there yet to come out of the box.  The Storyline has incredible depth in which we find a lot of interacting between the main cast which mainly focusses on the relationship between Bill and Alice, you could really tell that Kidman and Cruise were a couple in real life!Tom Cruise once again provides a pinnacle piece of acting that shows all aspects of his character.  I felt Kidman even though she was one of the main characters didn't really have that much to do and was left out in the cold most of the time!  The supporting cast were very good and helped build up the secrets to be unlocked!I will gve this film a 9 out of 10 because the script was excellent and Cruise was brilliant!",Eyes Wide Shut
367,cathyyoung1,"An illustrious career ends, sadly, with a dud",4,14 May 2000,"Last night I finally saw ""Eyes Wide Shut.""  The only good thing I can say is that it is often visually stunning (though nowhere near ""A Clockwork Orange"").  The story, moving at a glacial pace, was peculiarly uninvolving. The attempt to convey a sense of nightmarish, hallucinatory dread ended up being merely ponderous and ludicrous (especially in the infamous orgy scene; Kubrick seems to have had a most peculiar idea of forbidden sexual adventure in 1990s New York).  The dialogue, much of the time, was banal beyond belief, and the acting was mediocre at best -- with Sydney Pollack as Victor Ziegler and Marie Richardson as Marion the only two exceptions.  I've never thought much of Tom Cruise as an actor, but he was far better in ""The Firm"" -- here, you never for a moment forget that you're looking at Tom Cruise pretending to be a doctor.  Nicole Kidman was better, but in the key scene where she confesses to having lusted for another man, her delivery was somehow very unconvincing.The basic concept -- a husband and wife rediscovering their passionate erotic connection through (unconsummated) sexual experimentation outside their marriage -- is interesting enough.  But for it to work, the viewer must care for the protagonists and for their marriage (which EWS fails to achieve), and there must be real onscreen chemistry between them (which is completely absent here).  There is, in fact, no eroticism in the film at all, extramarital or marital; of course, Kubrick has always been a very cold and anti-sensual director (post-""Lolita,"" at least), so maybe this just wasn't the right film for him to make.Kubrick has made some of this century's true cinematic masterpieces -- ""Paths of Glory,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""A Clockwork Orange"" -- and other superb films such as ""Lolita"" and ""Full Metal Jacket.""  (I've never cared much for ""The Shining."") This is not the film he will be remembered by.",Eyes Wide Shut

370,Subzero7,Eyes Shut. And that about says it.,2,18 July 1999,"Well I can't say that I'm a major Kubric fan overall anyway but he does have a couple of good ones out there so I had hopes for this.  Unfortunately this movie lives up to pretty much nothing.  Not even what the trailer makes it out to be.  Which for me was a type of sexual thriller.  NOT!!!!  For about the first near hour the it's just totally boring.  But then something interesting starts and for the next hour and a half your strung along by your nose expecting something grand to happen.  He feeds you little tidbits just to keep you on the edge of interest and then ends the movie with a great big nothing.  A total dud.  I don't even think this movie had any reason to be made.  Other than ""basically"" good acting done by Kidman and Cruise, this movie doesn't stand out in any way.  And even their acting wasn't anything to talk about.  I know they are both excellent actors so I can only attribute their performance to both a poorly written script and somewhat tired directing.  I know that Kubric has done some good movies like THE SHINING and 2001 so I can only think that maybe it was his overall health that lead to this unfortunate travesty of a film.  And after seeing the film, it boggles the mind that it took three years to make.  I even heard on entertainment shows on t.v. that this was one of the most grueling films for Tom and Nichole to make and the it took a toll on them and wore them out.  If that's true, there is only one question to ask; Why!?  What was tuff out this movie.  There is no action; no stunts that either had to do, and as for emotionally, well, there wasn't anything emotional about it either.  So again I ask why.  Maybe it was just the demanding nature of Kubric or something.  Anyway, honestly, I wouldn't bother going to see this film if you haven't already.  It's not a thriller to keep you on the edge of your seat;  It's not an intriguing story for you to try to figure out(although it does keep you guessing just a little in one part, but not enough to warrant any kudos); and it's not a love story for you to cry about or be happy over.  Basically there just wasn't any reason for this movie to be made or any compelling reason for anyone to see it.  It disappoints on all levels.  Save your money for THE HAUNTING next week instead.",Eyes Wide Shut

Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. The storyline is gripping to the end, and leaves you thinking well after the movie is over. Excellent use of lighting and music add so much texture to the already strong story. Bizarre twists and compelling acting by Tom Cruise will keep you entertained until the credits roll. Fantastic movie!",Eyes Wide Shut
372,Michael Bennett Cohn,"has its moments, but overall a disappointment",6,17 July 1999,"I have had the pleasure of seeing every single Kubrick film on the big screen. While some were better than others, each one surprised with its unconventional storytelling, and usually with innovative visuals that stay with the viewer long after leaving the theater. Most Kubrick films are adapted from novels, but Kubrick felt quite free to vastly alter the original story for his own purposes. Films like Lolita and A Clockwork Orange use intriguing imagery to give physicality to books which have more to do with the workings of the protagonist's mind than his interaction with his surroundings.How strange, then, that Kubrick would adapt Traumnovelle, a story that takes place almost completely inside the protagonist's head, and that the adaptation would be so literal...setting aside, of course, the fact that Eyes Wide Shut takes place a century later than the novel. Bill Hareford (Tom Cruise) is clearly growing more and more obsessed about both his wife's sexual fantasies and a world full of sexual practices foreign -and inexplicable- to him. And yet, excepting black and white hallucinations of his wife with another man, his obsession, his confusion, is mostly implied, his specific thoughts and theories mostly left for us to be guessed at. And that's irritating, not just because we as an audience want to understand the character we're watching, but also because Kubrick has such a reputation for inventive dialog and imagery that simultaneously entertains and advances the story, while also giving us insight into what the characters are thinking. Of course, very often, as in 2001 or Lolita or Full Metal Jacket, not much context is required to understand the thoughts and motivations of any given character: they are driven by lust, survival, fear. But its harder to tell what Bill Hareford is driven by. Why does he go to the costume party? In the novel, it's a way of dealing with his growing irritation that perhaps he isn't as suave and cosmopolitan as he thought. In the movie, it's less clear. In the hands of a master storyteller like Kubrick, ambiguity can be quite appropriate, but in this film there is too much of it, or it's in the wrong places, or something. All I can say now, less than twenty-four hours after viewing the film, that the placement of ambiguity often felt intuitively wrong to me.The scenery is colorful and well-lit, the costumes are chic, the acting is good, and there are plenty of attractive naked women to look at, but with one notable exception - the already-famous costume party ordeal in the middle of the film - there is little here that is going to stick in my mind for very long. And...how...slow...Nicole...Kidman...talked....I...realize...it...was...on.. .purpose...but...it...got...old.What was so great about these scenes that they had to be filmed over so many times? And the hubub about the sexiness of the film is really misplaced...there have been much bolder, sexier, more shocking movies, many of them with an R rating. I would have liked to see the unedited NC-17 cut, but I fear genitalia and graphic sex would regrettably not make the story any more interesting.",Eyes Wide Shut
373,emorr,"Excellent, challenging film",9,27 July 1999,"This film is a challenge to watch. I must see it again.  There is so much ambiguity in the film, so beware.  Nicole Kidman should be nominated for her performance.  Cruise, probably not.  The digitized orgy scenes are a hype: you wouldn't know they did anything if you didn't hear about it first. By the way, that entire scene is worth your $8.00. It's tense and disturbing. Some people complain about the Cruise-Pollack conversation at the end.  I saw that as ambiguous as well.  People lie, you know. And of course, Kidman's final words make for a fantastic ending.  This picture is not for everyone. You have to like film, not movies (i.e., explosions, teenage angst, etc.).",Eyes Wide Shut
374,stephen niz,Sad but true,6,23 July 2000,"Stanley Kubrick never made a film that wasn't a masterpiece. True, the gaps between pictures became longer and longer with every release. But consider the idealistic changes he negotiated and plotted for twenty years before Scorcese made MEAN STREETS. Remember that Coppola's star only shone for a decade between THE GODFATHER and RUMBLE FISH, and Friedkin's even less. A tortured perfectionist, the twelve-year hiatus since FULL METAL JACKET further and further increased expectation for EYES WIDE SHUT.If I delayed in delivering the `But' part of the review, it's because it's almost impossible to give EYES WIDE SHUT the thumbs down immediately. Part of the heart desperately wants to enjoy it, the remainder begs to understand it. After two viewings and still finding I could do neither, I had to face the facts. EYES WIDE SHUT starts with a real sense of direction, but ends up going absolutely nowhere.True, Kubrick never minded slow-revealing narratives (best example BARRY LYNDON) which belong to an altogether different period of cinema. That would be easier to accept if the film did not burst to life with the energy and sense of dark humour that made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE tick. After nearly an hour of hypnotic, considered filmmaking, it just stops dead in its tracks.You find yourself pondering little blunders like Nicole and Tom's embarrassing effort at playing stoned, flaws which take on huge significance when you consider how trying the director was on his stars to get his vision across. If it is true that Kubrick demanded Cruise cross a road 90 times to `get the feel', you can play a guessing game, trying to pick which scene drove the star crazy. It has to be said, he crosses roads okay, but Cruise looks helpless most of the time.It seems that in the end, Kubrick's paranoia and neurosis crippled him where it really hurt. After being a slave to cinema - at the expense of the outside world - for the last two decades of his life, his final work fails to do justice, not to the hype (which was always an effective ploy) but to the great mans legacy. You can't help but feel sorry that such a badly-paced film is a poor epitaph. After a decade spent bringing it to the screen, EYES WIDE SHUT will go down as disappointing coda.",Eyes Wide Shut
375,DhavalVyas,Eyes Shut in Embarrassment.,3,8 November 2005,"'Eyes Wide Shut' was the final film of the legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's films probably have had greater disagreement among film lovers than any other movie maker in history. Just for that he deserves to be remembered. Those who love his works call him a genius, while those that hate his films call him a charlatan. Regardless of what people may think of him and his movies, it is no doubt that his films continue to fascinate the movie fanatics. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is no exception, although this reviewer will sympathize with those do no like this film. Most of this movie is very difficult to watch. No doubt, Kubrick's impeccable craft is still there. The lighting, editing, music and a creepy atmosphere stays throughout the film, as it does in many of his other films. What is horribly lacking in the movie is a screenplay, story, and most importantly, a point or moral. The screenplay is downright awful. I swear Tom Cruise repeats everything another character says to him. It is as though Cruise's character is absolutely clueless and has ADD. It is as though the screenwriters could not find anything better to write. The story is a absolute mess. Each scene is drawn out three times longer than it should. There are long pauses in the conversations, even though the characters are talking about the most mundane things. Rumors exits that Kubrick was a control freak. These rumors might be right. He was so obsessed with photography and technique that he destroyed any kind of spontaneity. The plot of 'Eyes Wide Shut'? Tom Cruise walks around ""New York City"" all night long encountering one bizarre sexual encounter after another. Many of these scenes are embarrassing and painful to watch. None of these encounters seem to bring any kind of point, except things most people already know. Although this movie has many bad things going for it, other things stood out that saved the film from being one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, and Sydney Pollack do a fantastic job in their acting. Their performances are powerful and convincing, and salvage a badly written story. Stanley Kubrick once again shines in his directing, as the orgy scene and the ""billiard room talk"" are both hair-raising and brilliant film-making. In the end though, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is pretty much a waste of time. Kubrick died before he finished editing the film, so maybe what we saw wasn't what he really intended. Nonetheless, even if Kubrick had completed the movie before his death, I don't see how the final product could have been any better.",Eyes Wide Shut

378,korch-3,Kubrick's Final Disturbing Yet Enthralling Masterpiece,8,11 October 1999,"Stanley Kubrick's last film is one of the most tense films I have ever viewed.  While watching it, I felt things were moving slow at times. Thinking back... I realize the tempo of this film was necessary. His directing style is similar to a composition played by a great musician. Just as the notes not played by a musician are as important as the notes played, Kubrick's sense of space and moments of silence are equally important. These quiet ""disturbing"" moments build tension, which would otherwise be lost, if continuous banter took place in its stead.The acting in this film is very well done and appropriate, but the real star here is Kubrick. Everything in this film gels just right. The lighting, framing, and melding of scenes are just perfect. The music also suits this film perfectly. Never has one sustained note meant so much to a film. Even the look and feel of New York is dead on even though the film was done entirely in England. The only thing I disliked about this film was realizing it would be Kubrick's last masterpiece.

379,Artêmis,One of the best movies ever made. Masterpiece.,10,20 December 1999,"I wouldn't say that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is perfect but it is at least 99,9% perfect. First of all, if you want to enjoy it, relax and try not to compare it to other Kubrick's movies because each one of them are completely different from others. I heard so many people saying that EWS was great but as it was from Kubrick, they're expecting more. I think it's unfair. Well, writing about EWS isn't easy because it deserves some reflection after watching. For me it's even harder as I'm not writing in my natural language but in English so, the only way I found to do this review was to comment each point of the movie particularly. The director: Stanley Kubrick is great. In fact EWS was my first Stanley's movie and that's another reason for me to wait sometime before writing this review.  I wanted to rent other Kubrick's movie to see if he was really the genius that all the magazines and newspapers were saying. I rented ""A Clockwork Orange"" and he's in fact, one of the best directors of the cinema history. And if you look at his filmography you can see how amazing he is. Some dramas as EWS, a science fiction (2001 - A Space Odyssey), a suspense-horror (The Shining), a war movie... And most of them are known as their category's best. Kubrick knew how to make us pay attention in the movie, stay tuned every minute, enjoy each scene. The 3 hours of EWS passed so fast for me and I wanted more and more. Kubrick is really a genius.The cast: the entire cast was great. Tom Cruise is for sure a good actor and Nicole Kidman finally used all her talent. Some people said that Nicole was not a good choice because she had always worked in bad movies but most of the actors and actresses don't start acting directly in good movies. There's always a first time. And Nicole is very excellent. One good surprise is the young Leelee Sobieski. Even appearing less than 3 minutes in the whole movie, she was amazing. She didn't need to say one word, looking at her face you knew what she was doing, thinking, that she was enjoying being used by her father... (Today, she had been nominated in the Golden Globes for her great performance in ""Joan of Arc"")
The soundtrack: I can't imagine different songs in Eye Wide Shut. They've used the best. Who is able to forget the amazing ""Musica Ricercata"", that played during the end of the ""climax scene"", the orgy? And the romantic ""When I Fall In Love""? EWS's should win next year's Academy Awards (today, it had been nominated for the Golden Globes!). The cinematography, art-direction, costume design and set decoration: great too! The clothes, sceneries, furniture, and the cinematography of EWS are just great. And they got even better mixed with the music. The best example is the famous orgy scene again: the music is tense and strong, the clothes (not very much, but there are) and masks are strange and mysterious, almost all the furniture, walls and clothes were yellow or black. Even the voices were strange! Perfect. The orgy scene will be forever in the cinema history. Polemical and provocative.The screenplay: the complex screenplay is the movie and each person has a different view about what Kubrick wanted to say and about the symbolism that is in EWS. What Stanley really wanted to say? What were his intentions? There are many different opinions and I'm not sure if mine is the best. In fact, there isn't one best interpretation. What I know for sure is that EWS is a amazing movie, from the best director of the world and not watching it is a sin. FOR SURE.And surely, 10/10",Eyes Wide Shut
380,preposterous,nice film,9,14 May 2003,"** possible spoilers **Part of my attraction to this film is admittedly Nicole Kidman's beauty, Tom Cruise's performance.  Kubrick is visually stunning, as always.What is this film about?  It's a film noir, in vivid color rather than black n white.  It's a film about sexual intoxication, and about fidelity. Through all of Tom's escapades and Nicole's dreams, their two characters remain faithful.This film is a document of a real life marriage, between Nicole and Tom, and their breakup was probably mirrored well by this plot, the only difference being that the characters have a daughter whereas Nicole and Tom did not have any children.  I wonder whether their divorce was already in the cards prior to shooting this film, or whether perhaps this film served as something of a catalyst.At the film's conclusion, Nicole's character tells Tom's that she cannot guarantee endless fidelity, but that they should have sex and play it day-by-day.  In other words, the only resolution is that the two characters finally have sex.  Neither of the characters had sex with anyone through the duration of a film which is saturated with sexual fantasy and orgies. 
This film is about how marital relationships and sexual relationships interact.  The film also documents the effects of economic/class standing and its effect on sexual expectation.  And it's a very colorful   moving picture.",Eyes Wide Shut

I gave up counting how many scenes have a Christmas tree in them even in the prostitute's shabby apartment. I am sure there is a graduate student somewhere who could write a dissertation on the symbolism. I am not qualified to remark on what Kubrick was going for but because he used so much of it - it must mean something. Right? It is not blatantly religious more of the traditional Christmas commercialism. The things I like most about this movie were a.) the acting b.) the sets (except for the fake New York City street sets.

The wife's shocking revelation of adulterous temptations prompt the husband to embark on a ill-fated nocturnal attempt to shed his everyman status. What follows is a nightmarish odyssey that is both disturbing and mesmerizing. Exhibiting his trademark simultaneous melding of drama, satire, horror and irony, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a fitting memorial to Stanley Kubrick's extraordinary career. The casting of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman may seem like a gimmick or marketing ploy, but they easily acquit themselves, particularly Kidman who impresses in her handful of scenes. Cruise may seem colorless in his role but that is the intent--he's a straight-shooting do-gooder whose self-control is painfully incongruous next to the depravity around him. His attempted membership in seediness is revoked at every turn, hampered by his impenetrable virtue. The much-discussed ""orgy"" sequence is actually pretty tame (compared to like material in much harsher R-rated fare) due to the ridiculous post-production insertion of computer-generated characters discreetly masking certain areas within the frame. Unfortunately, what should have been a truly potent sequence is now distilled into a mere suggestion of the darker side of fortune.

Maybe it is enough to ask whether this woman would say the line, and whether this woman is complete and coherent.Since I have a problem understanding the motivation of the man, maybe the movie did not hit me hard.It's very handsome.

Sadly, this film will also serve as his swansong. He died last March soon after completing this film.In ""Eyes Wide Shut"" Tom Cruise plays William Harford, a doctor who embarks on a dark sexual odyssey after his wife, whom he considered absolutely and routinely faithful, confesses she once contemplated having an affair with a naval officer she only glimpsed across a hotel lobby.  This confession comes after an upscale party where they both found themselves in the hands of lustful but unsuccessful seducers.  His faith shaken, Cruise examines his own lusts.  After an unconsummated dalliance with a Greenwich Village prostitute, he eventually finds himself in an ominous mansion where wealthy masked participants indulge in dark ritual, orgastic sex, and perhaps even murder.  But in a world where faithfulness is revealed to be little more than an illusion, can evil be any more substantive?Cruise, who built a highly-successful career playing brash but insecure boy-men in search of absent father-figures, plays Harford with the frightened smile of a man desperately trying to hide just how completely out of his depth he has fallen.  With ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" Cruise builds upon the strengths he exhibited in his previous film ""Jerry Macguire"" for which he was nominated for an Academy Award.  Perhaps the presence of his real life wife (and soon to be ex-wife) Nicole Kidman in the role of his screen wife gave him the ability to reach deeper into himself than before.  However, regardless of the true boundary of fact and fiction, this intimate on-screen pairing gives the film a strange voyeuristic quality.  Kidman herself gives an excellent performance and infuses her many nude scenes with a relaxed, almost banal, naturalness.The film is based upon the 1926 novel ""Traumnovelle"" by Arthur Schnitzler. Kubrick transports the characters from the decadent Vienna of the 1920's to the decadent Manhattan of today which Kubrick recreated in his adopted hometown of London.  The illusion is not entirely convincing.  However, rather than detracting from the film, the minute oddities and inconsistencies only add to the sense of unreality as Cruise falls from the safe world he once took for granted.Kubrick lets the story unfold slowly.  His traditionally languid pace comes as a welcome relief to the cut crazy films of our post-MTV era.  Lingering master shots allow viewers with an attention span of over five seconds to sink into this opulent world beautifully photographed by Larry Smith.  The film is long, but never boring.  The story resolutely defies expectations. Every time you think have it figured out, it takes an unexpected, and sometimes inexplicable, turn.  It moves from domestic drama to sexual obsession to murder mystery and back with ease.  Nor does he offer easy solutions.  He leaves the final interpretation of the events in the hands of the viewer.Kubrick has been rightly accused of being a cold, cerebral filmmaker. This approach was justified in the past by his recurring theme of dehumanization. Astronaut Keir Dullea evolved into a post-human entity in ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  Malcolm MacDowell, a futuristic sociopath, found his brutal inhumanity restored to him in the ironic ending of ""A Clockwork Orange."" Jack Nicholson and Matthew Modine both devolve into killing machines in ""The Shining"" and ""Full Metal Jacket,"" respectively.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" stands in a sharp contrast to those earlier films.  While Tom Cruise certainly loses his innocence and his comforting sense of security, it could be argued that the film ends with him being more fully human than ever before.Kubrick was a throwback to an earlier time when the movie-going public expected enlightenment from important filmmakers.  While that remained an impossible expectation, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" proves that until the very end Kubrick was at least asking the right questions.",Eyes Wide Shut
388,PogoNeo,A masterpiece? Of self indulgence maybe,2,10 April 2017,"How in just a few words presents itself the very last work of the supposed master of the cinema art, Mr. Stanley Kubrick? Plot holes; numerous. Rachitic and repetitive music, to the point of being annoying. Comedic thus completely out of place first of the two scenes at the costume shop. Very, very bad cheesy conversation with the masked woman at the orgy. Lack of proper pace and stretched scenes resulting in a completely unnecessary long screening time. To sum up: a failed movie. It is not like everything in it is bad, but overall it is a weak oneSome positive reviews say that all plot holes or artificial look of (staged) New York are to be a supposed hints at the dream nature of the events. But such claims are of equal value as those in regards to for example the bad lightning in ""The Godfather"" (1972), saying that it was done on purpose to underline the shady nature of Corleone family. But one of the actually good things in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is Nicole Kidman. Unfortunately, she only has the supporting part while Tom Cruise on the other hand in his lead acting reverts way to often to that characteristic rascally wicked grin of his- a gimmick performed by him in probably half of his movies. And if you want to count as goodies ""great tits"" (to quote the movie), we do get to see a lot of them. But then again, the orgy itself does not go all the way and so does not hers sailor fantasy. there are both important and yet not fully utilized, thus this picture it a sexed up drama but with not enough sex in it. And also on the sexuality note: what was the purpose of that out of the blue scene of pedestrians shouting some homophobic slurs at the main character and that other later scene with a male hotel desk clerk clearly hitting on him? It is not explored further and probably only time will tell if that was the director laughing at gossips about Cruse's supposed homosexuality or was this the director shoveling them in the actor's face; or was this just another inconsistency of ""Eyes Wide Shut""The side of the movie dealing with the mystery of that whole orgy society instead of evolving into a full thriller just fizzled out with almost nothing. We do see some investigative work and some threats, but nothing really happens; while the paste continuous to be extremely slow. As for the marriage-adultery portion of the movie, it ends up with a confrontation / confession that the viewers do not actually get to see- contrary to what Tom Cruise says to his on screen and then also real life wife (""I'll tell you everything""). It is as if after two and a half hours of already edited up footage, Kubrick finally came to his senses and realized that the film is way too long; and so he decided to speed things up from that point, by cutting to the aftermath of this conversation. And that is truly disappointing, because the argument of the protagonist couple near the beginning had some real acting value in it. And also because it is a clear sign of laziness in script writing (just how many times do we see in movies, especially in comedies, a bold defiant statement that should be followed by extremely entertaining / interesting scene, but instead of that the filmmakers diffuse problems of difficult / sophisticated execution of it by simply jumping over it?)To sum up: calling ""Eyes Wide Shut"" a masterpiece is a total misunderstanding. But if you do want to see a great piece of cinema work by Stanley Kubrick, then please go see his ""Paths Of Glory"" (1957) or the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968); but that other one only to the point when the s-f ends and that colorful rambling begins. Because let us be honest- not everything what Kubrick did was extraordinary / important / engaging. And his last picture is an example of a painfully bad end to a long and profound career; seeing this movie for the second time, at least 15 years after the first screening, only made the boredom experience twice as hard to bear",Eyes Wide Shut
389,Susie-7,Hit and miss,6,2 September 1999,"This movie needed more editing.  I know they wanted to keep the film the way Kubrick made it, but it seems unlikely to me that he wasn't going to edit it anymore after other people actually saw it.  Some of the transitions between scenes are absolutely horrible, and there is a lot of wasted space, though that likely would've stayed in the film; Kubrick always liked to plod along.Which brings me to my second criticism of this film.  At times I found it, well, boring, which seems strange, since it was billed as some kind of sex-fest; instead, there isn't that much sex in it, although in my opinion, that is probably a better thing.  I also thought the scenes with LeeLee Sobieski were quite irrelevant.  At most, they were amusing but added nothing to the story at all.My fourth problem was those stupid added-in figures in the orgy scene.  It's not that I need to see what they're obscuring; the problem is that the figures were extremely distracting and really stood out. 
My fifth problem also relates to the orgy scene: why were most of the women so skinny? The piano player talks about how amazing the women are there, and then they turn out to be a bunch of sticks.  I'm sorry, but if I can see all the bones in someone's back, even those in the lower back, bulging out, that person is too thin.  And people wonder why women sometimes feel so much pressure to lose weight.  In the case of the thighless woman who warns Cruise, I suppose it makes some amount of sense, because she's supposed to be a drug addict.  The only thing I can figure out, other than perhaps the casting director having some serious issues relating to body image in other people, is that the sometimes twisted attendants at the orgy prefer for some reason women who are highly abnormal.My last problem was the sometimes gratuitous use of the word f*ck.  I realise that many people use that word frequently. My problem with it is that, at least among people I know, when you're talking about sex with your (potential) life partner, you don't usually use such a crude word to describe having sex with that person.  Yet it is used frequently in this movie in that context.  ""F*ck"" is a word that fits very well to Kidman's fantasy about the naval guy, but not to her having sex with Cruise.  I suppose this is just my opinion, but I did have a problem with that, although it didn't affect my view of this film much.What I DID like about this film was that the basic idea of the film should provoke discussion among couples.  In perhaps a strange phenomenon, Person A knows that he or she is attracted to people other than Person B, and may even have been seriously tempted to act on such feelings, but it doesn't occur to him or her that Person B is in exactly the same situation.  And sometimes it bothers Person A immensely, just like in this film.  I suppose this is because we all know what goes on in our own heads, but we have to guess at what goes on in other people's; we don't know just HOW tempted they were, or if they acted on the impulse and just aren't admitting it.  It seems to me that this is a subject matter that every couple needs to discuss, rather than assuming something and living in a fantasy world, until it all comes crashing down when the illusion is shattered (like in the film- all that stiff about women being ""different"" than men).Warning: slight spoiler ahead.  Some people, including those I saw this movie with, seem to have missed the point of the HIV+ hooker.  My take on that was to show just what Cruise could have lost by acting on his jealous, untrusting, and perhaps vengeful impulses.  Instead, he got lucky- not in the way one usually would with a hooker, but because his wife called him on his cell right before he did the deed.  Would he have gone through with it had she not called? I would not have been sure he would, except that the next evening, he was already to get it on with hooker number 2, until she informed him of Domino's bad news.  This to me is another good point of discussion: should such things count as infidelity, when a person did not commit the deed but would have if he had not been interrupted (in the first case)? And in the case of Kidman's fantasy with the naval guy: should her insistence that, had the evening gone by a little differently, she would have had sex with him, be taken as an act of infidelity on her part,or should she be given the benefit of the doubt that she wouldn't have been able to go through with it? I think it is important for both parties in a relationship to know where the line gets drawn.I also thought that acting was, for the most part, good.  I did not find Kidman's laughing fit remotely unbelievably; it was perfectly consisted with my experience, however limited, with pot smokers. So basically, I thought this movie could have been substantially better (especially considering the number of retakes Kubrick insisted on), but it is still worth watching because it is thought provoking; it makes a person ponder both his or her own boundaries as well as those of his or her partner.",Eyes Wide Shut
390,suze-4,As bad as everyone said,2,13 April 2000,"I waited nine months to see this and being a Kubrick admirer I was ready to prove everyone wrong. They said it was a disappointment, not up to his earlier work, boring, and of course it was a box office dud. I was sure I would love it anyway because of Kubrick's earlier work. How bad could it be?Well everyone was right. This movie is just a dreadful domestic fantasy, a bored couple slumming on the dark side for an evening, and unintentionally ludicrous in parts. The famous ""orgy"" scene has chanting so annoying I had to turn the sound down. I don't know how theatre-goers stood it.
The movie is not exquisite or amazing, as someone else here said. The slowness of the scenes is just irritating, and there's nothing charming about all the Christmas lights. So what? It is pointless and only of interest to see what all the hype and hoopla were about. Nothing, really. See Tom and Nicole overact and overreact. A supposed mystery unfolding which just fizzles, a number of distasteful scenes, and then a silly comic ending.Oh well. Rent Lolita or Dr. Strangelove instead. They are masterpieces.",Eyes Wide Shut
391,seandchoi,A great finale to a great career,9,15 August 2001,"This highly anticipated film by Stanley Kubrick (his previous one was Full Metal Jacket, back in 1987) was also unfortunately his last. Tom Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford who, after getting into an argument with his wife Alice (played by his real wife at the time, Nicole Kidman) concerning one of her adulterous fantasies, wanders through the night, encountering various sexual temptations of his own, and ending up almost participating in a secret orgy of the rich and the powerful in a giant mansion. Eyes Wide Shut is an impeccably crafted and hypnotically paced meditation on the temptations and trials that can stand in the way of marital fidelity. In contrast to the many superficial films about love and sex that come out from Hollywood, Kubrick's film offers a profound and thoughtful look at marriage, love, and sex. Although the film features a lot of nudity, they are shot in an objective, ""matter of fact"" fashion, instead of to titillate its viewers. Overall, Eyes Wide Shut is a beautiful ""swan song"" to a very distinguished career of Stanley Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut
392,niteman,An impressive film with a bad marketing campaign,9,17 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut is ill-suited for the summer movie corridor.  It has no explosions, no running, shouting, or a single gunshot.  What it has are long scenes in which characters talk to one another.  Slowly and carefully.  The problem is that the film is marketed as having white-hot sex scenes and plenty of gratuitous nudity, while it has neither.  There is plenty of naked flesh, don't get me wrong, but in exactly the opposite way that the ads make it appear.  This is not a movie about being sexy and naked -- it's a movie about how flesh is just another part of being human, so what is all the fuss about?  The marketing campaign is misleading, and led to disappointment in the audience that I saw the movie with, who were just looking for some skin.The tension in the plot and the issues that the film discusses aren't telegraphed to the audience, they're hinted at in the dialog.  There is no neat resolution at the end, life simply goes on.   You may watch the whole film and think ""that wasn't about anything!"" Then think about what you've seen and realize it has a great deal to say.The film is a meditation on sexuality and how it relates to marriage, death, and money.  It's a fascinating commentary on modern life, and a rare movie that dares to examine sex as impassionately as any other issue.The directing and cinematography alone would be worth the price of admission without the social commentary.  The sets are an integral part of the movie; they breathe and glow and live.  Kubrick was a master director, and he uses long shots and dissolves to great effect.  Cruise and Kidman are at their best, and the supporting cast is also strong.  It's Kubrick's magic work with the camera that holds the film together.All in all, definitely worth seeing for the un-uptight.  It's possible to watch this film and actually think about it for hours afterward.  That's something you won't get with the Wild, Wild West.",Eyes Wide Shut
393,Adec,More than lives up to expectations...,10,5 September 1999,"First off I must say that I was not expecting Eyes Wide Shut to live up to the rather lofty expectations placed upon it, after all how many films truly live up to their hype? Despite the fact that I am a big Kubrick fan I'm one of those people who never goes into a film expecting to see something mindblowing, true I expected Eyes Wide Shut to be a good, well made film but that was as high as I (ever) let my expectations go. Personal rule number one of enjoying films to their fullest: never, ever believe the hype, always make up your own mind. And make up my mind I have...Eyes Wide Shut is a spellbinding and utterly hypnotic decent into sexual obsession that in my mind is truly deserving of the tag instant classic. Without a doubt one of the best, most intricate and fascinating films that I have seen in some time and definitely one of the front runners (if not the front runner) for best film that I have seen this year. Not only is it superbly crafted and acted but it's also a distinctly Kubrick film, and Kubrick at his best. The script (by Kubrick and Frederic Raphael) is very good and handles it's subject matter with a sense of honesty and believability that is rarely seen on screen, and then just when you think you have a handle on whats going on it takes an unexpected left turn and just keeps getting deeper and more complex. However the real reason for the films impact has to be put down to Stanley Kubricks terrific direction. He was one of the true greats of cinema, and his images and the all encompassing atmosphere that he was able to bring to his films is evident in Eyes Wide Shut in spades. I can't imagine any other director being able to make this film this way, or being able to make such a mix of the bizarre and the believable so stunning and engrossing. The often foreboding atmosphere that Kubrick has managed to bring to this film is truly something to behold and if he isn't at least nominated as best director come awards time for his work here then there truly is no justice in this world.Also of note is the terrific score by Jocelyn Pook which is at times quite minimalist in nature but just oozes atmosphere and dread and underpins the whole film perfectly, while the cinematography by Larry Smith again splendidly captures the mood that Kubrick was aiming for and is perfectly in sync with the world that Kubrick has created. Also of significant note is the fantastic costume design by Marit Allen, whose work here is worthy of both plaudits and awards. The masks especially are just amazing and heighten the atmosphere of the film to almost breaking point, the intensity brimming just below the surface of the film really does become that intense, with the costume design adding greatly to the overall effect. Acting is pretty much flawless throughout with Kubrick's well publicized perfection in ordering take after take bearing fruit and proving that all the effort was worth it in the long run. Nicole Kidman is fantastic as indeed many have stated but so is Tom Cruise, his performance here showing a definite maturity about it, and he manages to match Kidman in terms of performance. Both Cruise and Kidman have been perfectly cast here and their work deserves significant kudos as both have managed to walk the fine line of giving very strong performances without overwhelming the film or drawing attention away from the story which is quite an achievement in itself.The supporting cast (almost) all give terrific performances, with Vinessa Shaw, Sydney Pollack, Todd Field, Julienne Davis, Rade Serbedzija, Fay Masterson and Leelee Sobieski (who despite having almost no dialogue still manages to make a hell on an impression on sheer charisma and screen presence alone) all of special note, while Jackie Sawiris, Leslie Lowe, Louise J. Taylor, Alan Cumming, Mariana Hewett and Thomas Gibson all provide strong support. The only misstep seems to be a slightly overplayed performance from Marie Richardson that just didn't really work as well as it should have. Richardson's performance isn't bad but given the inherent quality of most of the other performances hers stands out simply because it isn't great.Haunting, highly original, at times surreal and always engrossing this is one of those films that I have no hesitations saying that any true film fan should at least see. It won't suit all tastes, in fact many may be bewildered by it at best, however this is still a unique and all too rare film experience. The fact is that this isn't a commercial film despite starring two A-list actors in the title roles, this is at it's heart an art house film painted on a much larger canvas and due to that fact it's overall appeal to general audiences is hard to gage. There is a fantastic piece of cinema here and those willing (and able) to go along on the films journey and get engulfed in it's atmosphere will find a film that is more than worthy of it's running time and their money. Yes the running time is lengthy, or at least seems so in the telling but this is one of those truly rare films that I just sunk into completely, losing all sense of time as it just glided by naturally, my attention thoroughly captured by the film itself. In short this is a must see film for anyone who loves cinema or who longs for something new, intelligent and truly unique. In fact the only people that should probably stay away from this film are those that are offended or embarrassed by sexual themes as the film is very frank and matter of fact about it's subject matter, and at times graphic in it's depiction of sex, jealousy, obsession and fidelity (though not nearly as graphic as had been rumoured). Eyes Wide Shut is a film of such quality that it can proudly stand along side the many previous classic Kubrick films with it's head held high in the knowledge that it more than measures up to it's heritage. More than that this is not just a great 'Kubrick' film but simply a truly great film full stop. One of the very best and for once a film that not only lives up to the hype but far surpasses it.An all too rare 10/10. One man's opinion.",Eyes Wide Shut
394,JonB-2,"From the Master, a Master Stroke",10,27 July 1999,"If you haven't figured out by the final frames what ""Eyes Wide Shut"" really means, then you just didn't get this movie.  Ironically, in order to get it, you have to keep your eyes (and your mind) wide open.  Mr. Kubrick has given us, for his final work, an onion -- an object to be examined, peeled, re-examined and peeled some more.  The layers, reverberations, twists, secrets, ironies and more in this film are just incredible.Did I mention that my initial reaction, as the closing credits rolled, was to just sit there with a dumb grin on my face thinking, ""Wow.""  The nearly three hour experience crept up, until, in the final moments, everything we'd been watching became absolutely clear and the revelation was spine-tingling. It's also the kind of revelation that says this is a movie to see again, then again.  I have a feeling that every viewing will reveal more answers -- and raise more questions.If you're paying careful attention, you will notice the first time through that the film is spattered with clues and indications of what's really going on.  Not to give anything away, but what seemed to be a blatant continuity error late in the film was actually a red flag indicating reality.  Trusting his audience, Kubrick doesn't bother to explain.  If, as an audience member, you trust Kubrick, you won't need it explained to you.As others have mentioned, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" most reminded me of ""Barry Lyndon,"" in look and feel -- but, perhaps as a farewell premonition, Kubrick has planted sly references to his other films throughout.  Pay close attention and you'll catch little hints of ""2001,"" ""Clockwork Orange"" and even ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""The Shining.""Nicole Kidman is amazing, and deserves at least an Oscar Nomination; Tom Cruise also pulls it off, with Kubrick using the actor's shortcomings in his favor.  (This is literally true; Kubrick is/was probably the only director who could get away with showing Cruise at his real height -- i.e., shorter than most other people on screen, including his wife, most of the time.) The cinematography is gorgeous.  Once again, there's magic here with light and things just look differently than you've ever seen them on film before. That said, though, the lighting isn't just flash -- pay attention to the changes in shooting style between saturated and flat on your first trip through, they are important.I have a feeling, once I've seen this film a few times, that it actually might squeak up my list and move ""2001"" and ""Clockwork Orange"" down a notch. Then again, when Mr. Kubrick died far before his time last March, every other living director (hell, every other dead one, too) moved up a notch in the hierarchy.  There just wasn't anyone better than Stanley, and in his swansong, he proved it again more than ever.",Eyes Wide Shut
395,Dr_Kruger,brilliant,9,19 June 2008,"From the second scene in the film, where Alice (Kidman) is shown on the toilet (just something perfectly natural, yet never shown in films) as they're getting ready for the party, you know this is going to be a different kind of a film.From the trailer that I saw so many years ago, with Chris Isaak's 'Baby did a bad bad thing' playing in the background while Cruise/Kidman/Kubrick was displayed in bold writing, I was expecting some sort of sordid, sleazy film. Certainlty some people's opinions are as such too.What I saw was an intriguing depiction of actions and consequences catalysed by events that never even actually happened, but were as damaging as those that did happen. Dr. Bill (Cruise) uses Alice's admission during a hilarious pot smoking scene as his excuse to justify his own desires and fantasies. The first visit to the hooker, leading to Dr.Bill visiting his old friends Jazz Club leading to the bizarrely fantastical ""Costume Party"" sequence are all a consequence of their pot smoking session.I loved how the plot came together, even though it was fairly obvious who the secret helper at the costume party was, and why his pianist friend disappeared the day after. Despite an intense feel to the film, the script and situations and the way they were delivered by those involved, most notably Cruise, consistently put a cheesy grin on my face.The film always kept me at full attention, got better and better and ended on a perfect note, summarising exactly my thoughts about their relationship.Great film",Eyes Wide Shut

However, many scenes just went on too long, with dialogue that was sometimes a poor imitation of Pinter. And I became a bit irritated by Tom Cruise's rather laboured performance.

399,Budd-5,A masterpiece!!!,8,4 October 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut is Stanley Kubrick's most mainstream and easily accessible movie. The Shining contained cold acting and cold sets, 2001 the same. These were great movies apart from the acting. They were the director's movies. What Kubrick delivers with Eyes Wide Shut is fabulous performances to accompany his always interesting direction.Cruise is a revalation as Dr. Bill. His happy and seemingly perfect life is damaged by Kidman's revalation that she has dreamt of having sex with a naval officer she only caught a glimpse of. He declares that he is not jealous but he spends the rest of the night roaming the streets for sex and delves deep into a scary part of New York's nightlife. Cruise excels as the professional who does not know what's going on. He doesn't understand his wife, his friend the piano player or even himself. He has to keep telling others that he is a doctor, he is really reassuring himself.Kidman's part is smaller and less revolatory. She plays drunk, drugged and the happy mother's role. Her descriptions of her sexual fantasies are lengthy and required credible acting to remain of interest. She pulls it off. Pollack, in a smaller role is effective as a kind of ""Deep Throat"". He fills in holes that have left Cruise confused but can we trust him? Pollack's nice guy approach to his role which contrasts his actions leave the question unanswered. Of course, this is Kubrick's film and it finishes off a remarkable batch of movies. For years Walt Disney has been issuing titles with the title ""Walt Disney Classics"". Perhaps its time for ""Stanley Kubrick Classics"" to be released. If so Eyes Wide Shut would be more than worthy of such a declaration.",Eyes Wide Shut

It isn't for everyone but I felt it was intelligent and if you get it, you'll like it. Sydney Pollack's performance seems to be the best one in the movie, and for once, I don't disagree with Kubrick's direction. For the most part.One of the problems is the movie is horribly paced and could have ended at 100 minutes instead of 158. It tacks on an extra hour of basically unnecessary story. Some of it is important, such as how the movie begins starkly likening unsafe sex to death. It's well-done, provocative, and intelligent. But it's too long.Another issue I have with the movie is with the two stars, Cruise and Kidman. There isn't much chemistry between them and whenever they're close to each other, it has this dry ""yeah yeah, we've done this before"" feeling to it. No real passion. Cruise proves once and for all in this picture that he cannot act. He is incapable of it. He gives a hollow performance comparable to Christian Bale's in ""American Psycho."" The difference here is that Bale's was intentional and effective, whereas Cruise's is simply empty and inept. Kidman seemed to ham it up a little too much for my tastes when she was intoxicated in this movie, and for the rest of the movie did her very best ""I wanna be Julianne Moore"" impression. We could have had better performances and more amiable characters if they'd actually cast Christian Bale and Julianne Moore. Cruise's Dr. Harford is weak and spineless; Kidman's Alice Harford is vile and sadistic.I think another thing that bothered me about this movie was how gratuitous some of the nudity was. A lot of it, such as Alice Harford undressing in the opening credits, was unnecessary. I'm a man, I like naked ladies, but the movie bordered on gratuitous at points. If you want to make a statement, don't throttle it with eye candy.Ultimately a great deal of the plot is grossly unrealistic and exceedingly hard to swallow. You'll have trouble believing most of it.But with all that's wrong with Eyes Wide Shut, there's still a very real, very potent story and message in it. I don't know what exactly it is to assimilate from this movie, but you will feel something from it.I just wish this story had been given more capable hands to mold it. Kubrick, Kidman, and Cruise have nearly ruined what could have been a much better movie.I give it a 6/10. An A for effort, D for execution.",Eyes Wide Shut
407,apioneer,Open Letter to Tom Cruise,2,19 October 2015,"Mr. Tom Cruise, I just saw your movie Eyes Wide Shut. I know this film was directed by Stanley Kubrick, the master. The master has passed into spirit but I want to say something to you. Tom, your acting was so bad in this film that it made me cry. You really needed to understand this character. Stanley Kubrick did not understand this character but you are an actor and actors take months to understand their character. You did not know how to play a doctor because I am a doctor and I know I would never act or behave in cheap manners you did in the film. This character was a manipulator who is two faced. He is one face at home but another personality who is lustful and he is always trying to meet these women because he knows he can have them.He gets so excited about fulfilling his lustful dreams that he ends up in a wrong place. That's what this character was about. Get it! Tom Cruise you played this character flat. I was so bored. I was dying to see this two faced person but you did not think about this character and just played it with no homework. I read an interview of you with Peggy in Hollywood Reporter where you said, nothing is really happening for you. Hey if you start learning how to act, something might happen. Your film does not make any sense because of bad acting. Nicole Kidman overacted in this film so much that I would have to write a separate letter for her. If you want some acting lessons and understanding the character, have your agent call me. Thanks",Eyes Wide Shut

I don't need to rehash the same notes on an older movie, but I will say that my husband and I both enjoyed it, and we rewatch it each year around Christmas, when it airs.I wouldn't even be writing a review, except that today is the first time I've ever scrolled through the list of actors / characters, and I noticed something that bothered me a good deal: the listing of ""Rowdy College Kids...""Seriously?! Rowdy college kids? Try ""homophobic, misogynistic creeps!""These ""kids"" clearly assaulted the male lead character in a verbal and physical way, because they assumed he was gay, and as they were walking up to him, one was describing, loudly and in detail, a more-than-likely made up tale of sex with a woman who apparently ""couldn't get enough."" And all the other ""kids"" laughed riotously along.Dismissing these jerks as ""rowdy college kids,"" even in something so banal as a list of characters from a movie just seems incredibly short-sighted.I wonder if this is how Stanley Kubrick saw these characters when he was making the film? He put them in there for some reason. And it wasn't flattering for them. Can't believe he'd dismiss them so gently.",Eyes Wide Shut

410,Nooshin_Navidi,"Not great, but watchable",7,11 September 2010,"The use of symbolism in this visually-rich film lent a much-needed dimension to the script, including the dreamlike atmosphere as well as all the symbols of the Illuminati, Priory of Sion, Satanic cults and secret societies.But... the problem is that symbolism alone is not enough to make a film ""great"", even one made by the legendary Kubrick. The cinematography was gorgeous, but I found the plot flimsy and patchy.This film could have been truly great if Kubrick either spent more time on the relationship aspect of it, really developing the main characters, or just skipped the relationship talk and made it a full-on suspense thriller. But it aimed for both, and sadly neither was strong enough to make you take the story seriously...Kidman is flawless & enchanting in appearance, however her character is poorly written & inconsistent, often over-acting to make up for the lack of depth. Cruise started out surprisingly strong & enjoyably subtle, but, like the story itself, got wobbly as things unfolded and was all over the place. His famous (or infamous) mega-watt grin was *way* overused, so that it became more annoying & transparently manipulative than charming (I know, surprise surprise!) Still, the film was compelling enough to make you want to keep watching. I just wished we could have seen the final cut which Kubrick submitted to WB before his death, but which was never made.~NN",Eyes Wide Shut
411,Nash,Great Ending for Kubrick,9,19 July 1999,Another wonderful film to add to Stanley Kubrick's wonderfully diverse list of credits.Tom Cruise and surprisingly Nicole Kidman give excellent performances.Wonderfully original.  The only thing I can think of that has a real similarity is Scorsese's After Hours.  The pacing is measured but I never notice the time once.  It was constantly compelling.  The 40 minutes of the Waterboy I sat through seemed longer.A low A.  See it today,Eyes Wide Shut
412,Tyler-Durden,"Summary is not required, check out the review.",10,6 June 2000,"Most of the time I start my reviews with the name of the movie... well, I'm not going to write it as the very first sentence in here, but please, allow me to talk about it before anything else. The name ""Eyes Wide Shut"" could be interpreted in a lot (and I mean a *LOT*) of ways, I do not think it should be appropriate to write my personal opinion about this matter.You know what? I will go straight to the point. People who are not smart could not have liked this movie. The thing is, as one of my friends said, ""it's a psychological masterpiece"", and intelligence is an important factor to understand this film. As other of my friends said, ""Some people either understood the movie, or they didn't understand anything at all"", and I agree. You can't be just thinking like ""I did not got that part very well..."", either you understood, or you did not.It seems like only a small minority understood this film. Of course, not everybody who could assimilate it was supposed to like it, but most of these viewers, yes. It could be said that the first hour is a bit slow, and maybe even the word ""boring"" could come up when talking about the subject. When the movie starts to focus on Tom Cruise's character, there is the real stuff, that is what we all paid to watch.Something that annoys me is the fact that I do not feel like expressing my personal opinion about this movie.I just don't think somebody who saw it and did not understand it, could read some of the reviews made, and just get an idea, and make their on conclusion, and think that they now know everything about the film.The movie was strange, that is, of course, undeniably. It was pretty under rated, but that was, of course, due to all the people who watched it and at the end did not have a clue about what they just had seen. They were just paying attention to the ""sexual"" part of the movie, which a mistake if you just want to see ""nude scenes"".You should try to imagine yourself in the position of Cruise's character, and then, only then, you could get an idea of how would it feel, and you might understand the whole deal, and even the purpose of the film.Another thing that should be understood to assimilate the idea of the whole film, is Nicole Kidman's character. By the way, now that I mention her... I think her performance could have been a bit better. All the conversations where Kidman is involved are important pieces that could help somebody understand that film.After watching this film, I am now obsessed with this one word, a word that contains 4 letter, F, U, C and K. This word is mentioned more than just a couple of times in this film, that caught my attention. From some points of view, and in some aspects, the whole film tried to focus on that word. The film's ending was a surprise, and to be honest, I knew that Kidman's last word was going to be that one. I do not know if it's really that predictable, but I figured that out easily.This film might cause some damage to people who did not understand it and tried to get a ""message"" out if it, because they could get a very wrong message.I'm rating the movie with a 10 out of 10 score, great film, enough said.",Eyes Wide Shut
413,blackcircles,WOW,10,26 April 2000,"I have seen most of Stanley Kubrick's films and consider him to be, at the very least, one of the greatest directors who ever lived. Throughout his career he never ceased to challenge his audience with movies like the deathly quiet 2001, the disturbing A Clockwork Orange and the horrifying The Shining. None of his films had as much impact on me as did Eyes Wide Shut, which, after multiple viewings, has become my favourite film of all time. For the life of me I can not understand how people can emerge from this film saying, ""I hate it."" People have complained that the sets feel unrealistic, that you would never find an orgy like that in the real world. If you wanted the real world, why did you watch a movie? I love the surreal and dreamlike state of this movie? I love how most of the conflict is internal and I appreciate the turmoil Dr. Harford has been thrown in when his wife admits to nearly throwing away the marriage for one night of passion with a stranger. With that confession, she admits that she is not as committed to the marriage as he is, which throws into question the entire authenticity of the union. When the doctor goes out into the night he finds himself on the receiving end of advances from various women. If he resists temptation, to what exactly would he be staying faithful? As much as I love this film, I refuse to buy it until Warner releases the unedited version in North America. The film is definitely worth seeing in any version, but I love it so much anything less than Kubrick's unmasked version will not do for me.",Eyes Wide Shut

This movie is a genuine cinematic masterpiece. The movie builds very slowly as Kubrick takes his time with every scene to show us each little detail he had in his mind. This is typical for a Kubrick movie to slowly but surely build suspense and other various feelings he wants to wake in us. But the scenes, however long they are, are stunning and gripping. The cinematography in this movie is one of the best ever in my opinion, the dialogue is, to me, brilliant, slow, but brilliant, the casting, I think, is perfect and the story is mesmerizing.
I have to say that this movie isn't for everybody and you shouldn't go watch this movie if you're sleepy or not fully invested in it. But for those who put themselves and almost 3 hours of their time into this movie will see the true genius of Stanley Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut

A man's odyssey into Soho after hours?  I thought Griffen Dunn did a better job in ""After Hours"".  At least that plot line was believable compared to this one.  Was it some sort of subliminal sexual message? As pretty as the girls were, I wasn't moved. Go watch ""Blue Velvet"" if you want to be disturbed on a sexual level. Perhaps it's art, I don't know.

First of all, I'm surprised so many people liked this movie, I didn't care for it too much. I think I knew what it was trying to say, and I appreciate for that it was just so, so, not really my kind of movie. Now, I LOVE Nicole Kidman, she's my favorite actress out now, and she was the best part of the movie, giving an amazing performance, incredible. Tom Cruise did his usual, ok performance, as did the rest of the actors. The plot is extremly hard to grasp, and I think my headache's from the day I've had, but trying to figure out this movie contributed. I tried my hardest during the creepy mask part, but then realized I had to just sit back and watch it, and the general idea of it came to me. At times I thought the movie was just plain weird, but I appreciate it.  Wrapping up here, I didn't really like this movie. Hard to understand, and incredible performance from Nicole Kidman. Drags out so long at parts, not a movie for the average film goer, but a more artsy if you will type movie lover.

419,David198,Flawed but fascinating,7,19 April 2004,"This is a film which divides its audience into those who are fascinated by it and those who are bored stiff.There's a lot that's good about it.  Tom Cruise turns in his usual capable performance, Nicole Kidman her usual brilliant one.  The sets are magnificent, reminding one of the huge rooms of The Shining or the emptiness of outer space in 2001.  The plot is thought-provoking, with its suggestions of the decadence and corruption of the rich and powerful.  The storyline, though long drawn out, is fairly easy to follow and has some sort of resolution at the end. There are even some light touches - Stanley Kubrick must have know it would be his last film, as there are visual or aural references to most of his previous films, and even a pile of Stanley Kubrick videos in a bedroom scene near the end!And any film with 3 different shots of Nicole Kidman's bare bottom will get me buying the DVD!But there are also flaws.  It is definitely too long, and would have benefited from losing 20 minutes at least.  There are illogical plot developments - e.g. just how did everyone at the orgy know so fast that Bill was there under false pretences? - and how did Mandy recognise him under his mask?  Also we learn virtually nothing about Alice and Bill's background other than that she used to own a gallery.  And much as I like Nicole Kidman's bottom, I have to acknowledge that its appearances in this film do seem totally gratuitous!A good film, but it doesn't come anywhere near Kubrick's best.  And, by the way, the Region 2 DVD is uncensored, unlike the Region 1 release.",Eyes Wide Shut
420,tangietangerine,Fidelio,9,28 June 2014,"Kubrick's last film couldn't have gone by without a fair share of critical backlash and general controversy, similar to what happened to mostly all of his movies. Also, similar to other movies of his, is the feeling of doubt and suspicion we feel after it's over. Like the final scene in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", we're not quite sure what the hell we've just watched, but we're certainly left intrigued with many different perspectives and the need to reflect about the meaning of all that. Because with Kubrick, and anyone who is/once was an assiduous viewer of his films would agree, nothing is incidental. It seems that every little thing is in its determined little place to make the wheel spin, so to speak.There are a number of conspiracy theories revolving around Eyes Wide Shut (like there was with The Shining and 2001, etc.), which we'll never be able to confirm or discard completely. But it's nevertheless interesting because it only shows how much we're affected by how he manipulates us throughout the story. Leaving the conspiratorial bit out for a while, what is left is an ambiguous story seen from Tom Cruise's character point of view...what in his nocturnal adventures were real? what's real? just because things happened inside one's head, it doesn't mean they weren't real, does it? His mind plays perverse tricks with him. From the point when his wife, in a provocative monologue, dangles the possibility of cheating on him, just about everything he comes across has an undertone that relates to that matter. And it's so subtle, from the bunch of bullies who question his ""manhood"" in the streets, to the unexpected encounter with the Russian guy's daughter, it all seems to echo what's going on inside his mind. Would his wife really betray him if she was given the chance? would he be able to do the same? In the middle of all this, he comes across some sort of bizarre ritual, both sacred and profane, and even though he's wearing the same costume and behaving like the others, he fails to blend in and people soon notice he should not be there. Did those people also realize he didn't have what it takes to be a part of the ""cult""? in other words, to have sex with a stranger and to desire to do so.It's hard to talk about this scene and not mention what a beautiful piece of film it is. I guess it's one of the times where Kubrick succeed best in creating a perfect mood that completely immerses us. All of the elements work, the atmosphere created by the score, the costumes (especially the one who nods to Bill from up the balcony) and the general feeling of strangeness, as we've entered another dimension apart from our world, apart from Bill's repressed middle-class life.One part which was left unanswered to me was the next scene, when he comes home and Nicole Kidman's character mysteriously has had a nightmare very similar to what he just went through. It could be some sort of subconscious transmission, almost psychic, but there's just something about it that doesn't fit. Later on, Bill's friend tries to clear all this mystery to him, saying there was nothing to it, it was all an act, fake, meant to scare him away. But who would do such a thing? Picking up the pieces, for a few moments I even believed Alice could be involved in the farce...because of the nightmare's timing, and the mask found on the bed beside her.This is just a tiny little analysis compared to the whole richness of the movie, but it's where it got me thinking. And I'm sure that's what Kubrick wanted in the first place. It's not so fun when an explanation is thrust upon us, like a game of questions and answers, because there is so much more to a story and a character than a filmmaker would be able to synthesize in one last scene. That is one of the reasons why I hold Stanley Kubrick's films so dear, because the genius of him is to never give easy way outs or shortcuts, and to turn each one of his movies into a vast universe where anything is possible.",Eyes Wide Shut

For those who have taken some chances, seen some real diversity and tasted the unique flavors of life, this film feels much like decaf coffee. Some of the character development is inconsistent. This makes the plot difficult to believe. Rarely does a person summon the courage to make such a rapid advancement from timid mainstreamer to bold party crasher in the matter of few hours. Also the use of murder is a poor fit given the limited exposure to risk by the party hosts. The activities at the party were R-rated but not so extreme as to merit the taking of life to conceal the activities. If you have lived a full and colorful life, skip this average art work. If your idea of a wild time is hooking up with a stranger or going to a party where you know nobody, then this film might impress you.

425,shakes-14,Very good movie.,10,18 July 1999,Eyes Wide Shut is classic Kubrick. The music and lighting of the film sets the mood as did that of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey.  Nicole Kidman plays the best performance of her life in my opinion.  Tom Cruise is wonderful as Bill Harford. Sydney Pollack also plays a good part. Some people say that the movie would have been better if Harvey Keitel had played the part and say that Sydney Pollack's performance was the only flaw in the movie.  I do not agree though I admit it would be interesting to see Harvey Keitel play the part. The movie takes you many visually provocative locations and introduces you to many provocative characters emphasizing the MANY.  Among them there is one played by the beautiful and talented Leelee Sobieski who was also good in the TV movie Joan of Arc though her part is meager in this film and I don't even think you hear her say one line she captures her character well.  Within every character the spirit of this movie is captured and that is one of the many beauties of it.  Well to conclude I'm going to say something that you've probably already heard but by all means that doesn't make it not true.

In my case, that is why I'm disappointed. Because Kubrick was unable to maintain his extreme brilliance in what ended up being his final film. It was not a bad movie. Despite popular opinion, Tom Cruise's performance was fine in my eyes. Also, Nicole's limited opportunities didn't exactly scream ""Oscar!"" (but what has in 1999?) The story was interesting to a point, but after 159 minutes, I had almost lost interest and noticed that many of the people in the theater had as well. Slightly over 2 hours would've been much better for the film's pace. The thoughts that ran through my mind:-- Haven't I seen this before? A different plot but the same idea done in a better way by Martin Scorsese in ""After Hours."" True, ""AH"" might not be as profound, but that works to its advantage, anyway; EWS wasn't all that deep.-- Kidman pulled off the stoned act rather well. Either that, or everyone I've been in company with that was high acts the EXACT same way.-- After bragging to all my friends about how the almighty Kubrick had released another masterpiece, I realize I have a lot of phone calls to make once we get home.But it wasn't bad.

427,WriConsult,"Mis-marketed and misunderstood, among Kubrick's best",9,7 June 2002,"***SPOILER ALERT - I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS MOVIE! ***It's a shame that this film was promoted as a ""hot"" erotic thriller. Kubrick would not have allowed that marketing campaign to go forward had he been alive.  Sure there's a lot of eroticism in this movie, but those who go to it looking for sexual thrills are going to be (and were) sorely disappointed.The events in this movie are triggered by the protagonist's wife's revelation that she almost slept with another man.  This kicks off a range of emotions and prompts him to re-evaluate his sexual relationship with her, subsequently leading to a trip through his sexual SUBconscious.  This is the critical point that all too many viewers miss, though it's so overtly surreal I don't see how one could miss it.  None of this is real!  It's called Eyes Wide SHUT for a reason!All of our protagonists' ""encounters"" represent manifestations of his sexual fantasies and fears.  His fantasies include group sex, sex with a teenager, sex with a prostitute, sex without strings.  His fears include disease, homosexuality (notice the brutal and brief encounter with the gay-bashing gang), and most of all: discovery.  Discovery of his hidden fantasies, which might reveal his true nature to the world.  Discovery that he is really a pretender, doesn't really belong, and is not worthy after all.  This latter is probably universal, and in his case while it has sexual dimensions it is not purely sexual.  In the end he realizes that his fantasies are just fantasies, at least some of his fears are legitimate, and that instead of just fantasizing about sex he should actually have sex with his wife.  Not rocket science here, but plenty of people need reminding of this from time to time, and it's a well-told story.I was fortunate enough to first see this movie in theaters overseas, and was spared the atrocity of digital editing to make things less explicit. David Lynch did the same thing more recently in Mulholland Drive, and I hope that this is not the beginning of a trend.  Given all of the explicit gore and brutality in movies, the level of sexual explicitness that triggers the censors is simply laughable.  Frankly, having seen the un-edited version, I didn't think it was a big deal.One can't dismiss criticisms that the nudity was all female and many of the women were depicted as sexual objects, but this movie is quite pointedly a trip through a fairly conventional man's sexual unconscious and necessarily told from a male point of view.  So none of these things should be a surprise.  It would be very interesting to see a comparable exploration of the female sexual subconscious by an accomplished woman director, though I'm not holding my breath that the Hollywood establishment will allow that to happen soon.",Eyes Wide Shut

At least in this Americanversion (I've read the European edition is more explicit) the sex isnot actually that graphic, although Nicole does use the `f"" word alot. But that's not really the core of this film at all. Cruise andKidman play a couple, Dr. Bill and Alice Hartford, who are nicelysettled into their nine-year marriage and young daughter, but, wefind, they fantasize about adventure and forbidden sexual territory.It starts with Alice's indirect and maddening musings about therelationship which Bill perceives as dissatisfaction and criticism,but after a chance meeting with an old med school chum, hediscovers an occultish sex club that pushes the limits of reality andterror. Behind it is really a morality tale that, after all, makes astrong statement about love and commitment.

429,dustinkdye,What did Kubrick want us to open our eyes to?,10,19 August 2020,"Eyes Wide Shut is a movie like Casablanca or The Wizard of Oz (which is subtly referenced in the film) in that the more times you view it, the more you get out of it. (I imagine at some point you would wring out all the meaning, but that would take scores of viewings.) One infamous scene is so over-the-top it is easy to miss all the subtle references in the film, which necessitates multiple viewings. Fair warning--the more times you watch it, the more you go down the rabbit hole Kubrick digs (a reference to Alice in Wonderland, also evoked in Eyes Wide Shut).Eyes Wide Shut was inspired by an Austrian novella called ""Traumnovelle."" The film is indeed dreamlike. Kubrick recreated Greenwich Village on a sound stage in London, which, like a dream, is slightly off from the real thing and contains no superfluous elements. This evokes the perfect atmosphere for the movie as we accompany Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) on his all-night, humiliating, surreal odyssey.To me, the title of the movie, Eyes Wide Shut, implies willful naivete, particularly Dr. Bill's, and by extension the viewers', which seems to be (one of) the theme(s) Kubrick intends to highlight. Even the movie's poster seems to imply this: a mirror image of Nicole Kidman's character (Alice, as in Through the Looking Glass), looking right through the mirror in what appears to be an Illuminati image, while Dr. Bill has his eyes closed. In fact, all the shots of Alice looking in the mirror started to creep me out on subsequent viewings.The movie then indulges in conspiracy-theory dog whistles to anyone whose eyes aren't wide shut. The Harfords are a WASPy family living in a luxurious apartment in Central Part West, which may be out of reach for a doctor (basically, a highly paid member of the working class) whose wife doesn't work. Furthermore, Dr. Bill Harford (whose name sounds like ""Dollar Bill Harrison Ford"") throws around money like it's no object. Which raises the question of how he really makes his money--apparently by making house calls to the ridiculously wealthy who can afford to avoid hospital waiting rooms. Dr. Bill seems to aspire to rub shoulders with these people, but he is spectacularly naive to the realities of the world he is tangentially involved in and his actual role in it. It seems to me the reason he was invited to the Victor's (as in an economic ""victor's"") luxurious party at the beginning is because it is a house-call in disguise in case of something like the OD that indeed occurs at one point. I determined this by reading between the lines when the two models hit on him, and he seems oblivious to their allusions of taking him ""to where the rainbow ends"" (more on that below) and when he is taken away at Victor's call, they exchange looks that seem to say they had mistaken him for one of the elites, not a working-class schlub.FULL-ON CONSPIRACY THEORIES BELOW.If Dr. Bill's eyes are wide shut, then Alice's are partly open. This is implied in the very first dialogue exchange in the movie, when Alice knows exactly where Dr. Bill had left his wallet, while he had forgotten, and he doesn't remember the name of the babysitter, which was mentioned like 30 seconds earlier. This comes to the fore when he simply can't imagine Alice being unfaithful to him because women don't think like men, and she falls to the floor laughing and divulges a depressing sexual fantasy. Alice looks in the mirror a lot, most memorably when she stares in the mirror as Dr. Bill begins kissing her. Is Kubrick implying Alice is a former sex slave who is going ""through the looking glass""--the mental space sex slaves go to mentally block their abuse? Is that why Alice is constantly grooming their daughter, Helena? Is she subconsciously grooming her daughter for a similar fate? Is that why in the final scene, when Alice and Dr. Bill are wrapped up in their conversation at the toy store, Helena can be seen running away in the direction of two men in the background, who had also been in the background at Victor's party? Among the strange toys at said toy store are stuffed tigers and a game called ""Magic Circle""--resembling the imagery at the secret society's ritual/party Dr. Bill crashed and apparently a prop created for the movie. The stuffed tigers are identical to one on Domino's bed, a streetwalker Dr. Bill meets in Greenwich Village. Is Kubrick implying Domino is a sex slave, having undergone ""Beta Kitten"" programming, and the juxtaposition of the same toy with Helena in a toy store implying the girl's fate as well as the creepy conditioning the elites are subjecting the masses to?Then there are the references to ""rainbows,"" as in ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" another reference to sex slave conditioning, similar to ""through the looking glass."" The two models at Victor's party offer to take Dr. Bill ""to where the rainbow ends""--where they go mentally when they're having sex. Then there is the costume shop ""Rainbow"" where Dr. Bill obtains the cloak for the secret society's party and where the proprietor's daughter prostitutes herself. The girl runs from her enraged father, gets behind Dr. Bill for protection, then whispers something inaudible into his ear. The version of the movie I own has Japanese subtitles that translate what she said: She tells him which cloak to choose. Does she infer where he is going with that cloak and does she have knowledge of what goes on there? That would seem to connect her with the rainbow image in the store's name.Finally, I question how accurate Kubrick's depiction of the elite's secret society is. It seems to be a hodgepodge of hellfire club, Bohemian Grove, Illuminati/Freemason, O.T.O. imagery. Are there elite cadres involved in these types of ritual debauchery? I'd guess Kubrick was close enough to these people he probably saw a lot and knew enough to guess at the rest (such as the sort of parties the Rothschilds threw--the exterior of the house of the party was one of the Rothschilds' residences). There are disturbing parallels with Eyes Wide Shut in the Jeffrey Epstein case and his ""suicide."" I'm guessing it is true in broad strokes. I think Kubrick was telling us society's elites engage in depravities that would frighten and disgust the masses if we knew about them, and therefore we shouldn't be so naive to grant the economic victors any moral authority.",Eyes Wide Shut
430,ChakaMan,Hope this isn't how Kubrick is remembered,6,25 May 2000,"Eyes Wide Shut portrays, in a distinct, memorable, Kubrick-esque kind of way, the moral dilemmas that attractive partners in a cozy marriage face. It also managed to leave me high and dry.The movie itself is intriguing. Images of a ritualistic swingers club and a build-up to a murder-mystery plot are paced a bit slowly, but on par with plot development in other Kubrick movies. Dr. Bill Harford's (Tom Cruise) wild jealousy over his wife's confession of her fantasy about another man provides the fuel for the events that unfold in a quirky and disturbing way.Nicole Kidman, who plays Bill's wife Alice, manages to suck the life out of many scenes with over-the-top acting, but still scrapes up an excellent performance in the ""confession"" scene. Also, the pattern of dialogue--the actors repeated the lines of the other actors frequently--became extremely obtrusive. But the gravestone of this movie was the ending.Eyes Wide Shut is worth a look for solid film-making and editing. Don't expect to find closure; have a back-up movie handy. I would consider this movie a ""mirror"" of The Sixth Sense in that Eyes Wide Shut has a horrible ending where The Sixth Sense has an excellent ending (that the whole plot depends on).",Eyes Wide Shut
431,Vince-40,A great movie by one of the greatest directorS of all time!!!,9,19 July 1999,"Stanley Kubrick last film is great. I am a Kubrick fan and a big cinema fan. Kubrick abandon a bit his style that he has use since 2001 A Space Odyssey for a more new style who let me remember the great Martin Scorsese. And, by the way, the whole film has an atmosphere of Taxi Driver Kubrick's version.The message of the movie is difficult to understand (well, it is Kubrick). It is one of his less commercial film in the range of Lolita. This is an unerotic movie with a lot of sexual content. One of the most weird movie that I have seen in all my life (David Lynch's Blue Velvet is another).The actors are good. Tom Cruise, in my opinion, is not a great actor, but in this movie he seems credible. Kidman is at his best as always. She is really one of the greatest hollywoodian actress. Sydney Pollack is also credible even if his last scene (the non-explicative scene with Tom Cruise) is a tough one for the audiance to beleive.I must say that I attended to see the greatest film of my life and I was personnaly disappointed, buy it is obvious that it is a film to watch and rewatch again and again like all the Kubrick movies. The problem with me and the movie was that the central theme of the movie was not a theme that really cared about... well rare are the director who let me appreciate a movie with a theme that you don't personnaly care... I can think a few names.....Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Terrence Malick, David Lean, Steven Speilberg and Stanley Kubrick.Remember it is not a commercial movie, so may LOVE it or you may HATE it. It happen all the time with very personnal movie just think of 2001 A Space Odyssey or the great war movie The Thin Red Line.",Eyes Wide Shut

The film is riveting, erotic and absolutely terrifying. The cinematography is some of the best that I have ever seen. The performances are flawless. The story is undeniably brilliant. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are completely convincing as husband and wife. The entire film feels like a lucid dream. The film is clearly inspired by the work of David Lynch.

To make short work of it, Kubrick explores the intertwining relationship between eros and thanatos and subtly supports it with a metaphysical theme (the Fall of Man, Man's redemption by Christ), and still delivers a never less than mesmerizing film, directed as an extended dream sequence. As pretentious as this sounds, the actors register across the board, with particularly excellent work by Kidman. Cruise is something of a revelation here; I've never seen such impressive work from him. The movie is a surprising coda from Kubrick, since it is an uncharacteristically intimate and optimistic film.",Eyes Wide Shut

In fact, perhaps a hour of going over her body with the lens . . . from all angles . . . would have made a better picture (at least for the guys in the audience).  What we got, was not too far removed from that.  I think this movie ran way too long. Not sure what the point was of having a child in the picture, except to demo how Tom has almost zero relationship with her.  Tom, as a doctor, kinda had a false ring to it . . . Some of the mood and imagery was interesting, and kinda ""artsy,"" however, it did not seem to fully develop.  To paraphrase Garcia, ""What a long, strange   trip"" this was.  Did I enjoy it?

It was like lets go to shocking scene 1... action... cut... now lets go to shocking scene 2... action... cut... etc.They could have made five different interesting movies by expanding/going into more details in each of those shocking scenes.  Instead, I felt that I was being jurked back and forth and left and right and waiting to see what the point was only to be disappointed. Now how does all of this affect the marriage?

438,Erich-13,Lesser Kubrick is still high above most pictures,9,17 February 2000,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece.  However, while it suffers by comparison to Kubrick's past works, it is still one of the most intriguing, challenging pictures of the year.I can understand how many viewers might not have the patience to contemplate Kubrick's ambiguous tale, and might dismiss it as a disjointed assemblage of chance encounters and unconnected events.  However, if you're in the mood for a movie you need to interpret for yourself, rather than having the message spelled out for you, you should give it a try.My personal interpretation of William Harford's enigmatic night on the town stems from the title of the Schnitzler story it's based on, ""Traumnovelle"" (""Dream Novel"").  I think of Harford's journey as being like a dream, with all of the occurrences influenced by his own subconscious mind.  He is led into numerous encounters with temptation, but something always occurs to prevent him actually following through.  This might seem like absurd coincidence, but if you think of it as a ""Dream Movie,"" it can be seen as a manifestation of his own conscience, conjuring up obstacles to prevent him violating his moral code.Is my interpretation the one Kubrick had in mind?  Who knows?  But any movie that proves so thought-provoking is one I have to recommend.",Eyes Wide Shut
439,timmyminh,Traumatizing and Disturbing,9,17 June 2020,"There are instances where a film traumatizes me beyond beliefs, that makes me staying up late thinking about the deep and frightful trench of this human experience, and Stanley Kubrick's films never fail to enact that part of my psyche - to dare to provoke in me this dimension of human nature that we don't usually like to visit. And this film traumatizes me just like that. I was too psychologically affected that I did not bother washing my dishes and read my book before bed (my daily routines that I regularly enjoy). That is needless to say this film struck me to the core, and I am still shook by it. It is Kubrick's last venture into the study of humanity and human nature.We the audience are embarked on a sexual odyssey with our protagonist to which we explore the sexual subconscious of the human psyche, represented through material events acting as archetypes. Sex is a lot of things; it can be marriage and fertility, the emancipation from virginity and empowerment of women's position in men (as the conversation between the Hungarian man Alice indicates), it can be solace and comfort for pains (Marion kissing Dr. Bill after her father's death) , it can be a mean for financial survival (prostitution), it can be kink (the two men having sex with the store owner's daughter while dressed in women's garments), and the masonic elites ritual performed in a dark and sinister proportion. Then there is the creepy mysterious soundtrack that I'm guessing was composed in two notes, the tune keeps ringing in my head as if a nightmare. The film leaves a lot of questions and hidden meanings that I am determined to muster out an answer and interpretation, but rest assured that I may probably will never watch it again.Kubrick's films have always discussed radical and controversial topics which are visual literary discussion into human behaviorism and subconscious. Thank you Stanley Kubrick for everything, and I hope there are people like me who should praise and uphold his films and legacy, and to make sure they are way up there with the titans of art.",Eyes Wide Shut
440,sowvendra,"A beautiful, understated, gem of a film",10,18 September 2016,"Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw in ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Stanley Kubrick takes the stars out of Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise and makes them any ordinary, self-searching people. Kidman of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was certainly not the Satine of ""Moulin Rouge"" or any star character of any of her other films. Tom Cruise was not the Tom Cruise we are so used to seeing: Maverick, Ethan Hunt and all. Both Cruise and Kidman were both disrobed and demystified in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" that I felt sorry for them. They are vulnerable, they cry, and they are absolutely not the stars or heroes we are used to seeing.As a film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" works excellently. Though it has been billed as an erotic thriller, it is also a study into human relationships, especially between married couples. There is a line in the film: ""Don't you think one of the charms of marriage is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties?"" This line was spoken in a flirtatious way at a party, but this line seems to be the message the entire film seems to be built upon. In a married couple, who shows the most honesty, the husband or the wife? Alice and Dr. Bill Harford (played by Kidman and Cruise) are a well-to-do New York City couple. Bill is a general practitioner, while Alice used to be a manager at an art gallery who is now a housewife looking after Helena, their only daughter, aged 7. In a cannabis-fuelled haze, Alice reveals that she had wanted to be unfaithful to Bill once, though she hadn't. Bill is unable to stand this revelation, though he doesn't show it, and roams the streets of New York City that night watching apparently committed people turning to adultery, morals (depending upon how one defines ""morals"") being disregarded, and, the highlight of his introspective adventure, gatecrashes a secret party where orgies are being held and that nearly endangers his life.After a lot of revelations and catharsis, the film ends well. But it leaves behind a number of questions, the biggest one being: Who between a husband and a wife is the most honest? We see Alice being honest to her husband, but Bill - because of several issues, including the doctor-patient relationship of secrecy - cannot be that honest with his wife even if he wished to. So was it right for Bill to get so upset about something that Alice said she had wanted to do but she, ultimately, didn't? Was it right for Alice to tell her husband something that she didn't do? Is it right for couples to discuss their fantasies involving other men and women? Or was that joint Alice and Bill rolled that was to be blamed? With a lot of self-searching questions, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is an amazing and beautifully understated thriller.Also, check out the background score. There are a lot of classical music pieces. But what really caught my attention were the menacing piano solos that pop up all of a sudden at critical points. Also, piano - or, rather, a pianist - plays an important role in the plot. Hats off to Stanley Kubrick for giving us this gem of a film called ""Eyes Wide Shut"" just before he departed!",Eyes Wide Shut
441,parlo,legs wide shut,5,18 July 1999,"For a movie about sexual obsessions and sexual jealousy and a supposedly complex marital relationship -there was little sex in evidence. Tom & Nicole may have felt they were doing something scandalous and historical but the naughtiest thing they do is say the F word a lot. This feels like the sort of film that will be hailed as a masterpiece solely on its reverent pacing and the reputation of its director...not based on what it actually is.The cinematography and lighting were gorgeous and Nicole Kidman had some interesting moments near the beginning but everything felt so forced, so deliberate...its as if everyone in every scene was too aware the entire time of the importance of the project so anything idiosyncratic or spontaneous has been stamped out. It felt depressingly lifeless and studied.The big set piece (the orgy sequence everyone talks about) is creepy to a degree but hardly as shocking as it wants to be.

Although the plot of this film was not as interesting as his previous, the performances by the most of the cast (kudos especially to Kidman), the director's stark visual style, and the eerie musical score came together to create a great movie experience.  My only complaint is the casting of Tom Cruise.  He seems sorely out of place in a Kubrick film.  Most actors seem to blend quite well into the ""Kubrick-world,"" but he sticks out terribly and I never truly believed his performance.  That aside, I enjoyed this film tremendously.

The movie was well-acted all the way around, with Kidman in particular impressing me. The music was excellent, going perfectly with the movie, especially the steady piano pulse, which was down-right chilling. In keeping with the mood of the movie, the emotions always lurked right under the surface, never quite rearing their heads. The intensity of the cult ritual scene was incredible. This is truly a movie to make you think.This movie is long, yes. It has a fairly slow pacing, yes. But its a sad day when people cannot muster the attention span to watch such a moving film. This was an excellent movie, a true credit to Kubrick's name, and it was a fantastic way for him to wrap-up his career. Looking back, I seriously can't find any substantial flaws with this film.

445,Arisdoddle,I started a joke....my review of 'Targetted Bill-dividual'.,5,14 May 2014,"(Only mild, kinda vague spoilers so...be brave and read!)Gooooood gooooogly mooooooogly people!It's a psychological mind game! And everyone's in on the joke but Bill, and possibly his wife, or else she's the mastermind.(remember, we didn't see the film Kubrick intended)At no stage during the film is Bill in control of his destiny. It's likely Kubrick's attempt to reveal a pervasive, insidious modern phenomenon known as Gangstalking(I call it the modern inquisition. You can call it 'The Guilt Game', if you like)Watch it again and take note of the facial expressions of seeming 'bit players', like the hotel attendant and the diner waitress(and Bill suspected EVERYONE...eventually, including his wife).The hooker didn't have AIDS. Her room mate told Bill that to chip away at his sanity, and to further emasculate him, which is why she rubbed up against him to begin with - to get his 'fires' started.(The sexiest scene in the film for my money...which is saying something, since they were both fully clothed)Hooker 1 couldn't reveal that she didn't have sex with Bill to her masters, for fear of displeasing them(the explanatory scene was probably ALSO cut from the film). As far as all the other 'players' were concerned, they had sex...so the 'game' was still on. But Bill's suspicions were raised because learning of her AIDS diagnosis was essentially irrelevant to him, since he didn't have sex with her, which the room-mate should've known.Remember the newspaper Bill picks up late at night? What does it say? What are the odds that Bill would pick up that newspaper at that time and read that headline?The reason the movie doesn't make sense is because it was de-sense-itized.'The Cabin In The Woods'(the start at least) is another example of this 'game', and how it might work.Know Thy Self, or place your destiny in other people's hands!

446,juujuuuujj,"Predictable and memorable, simplistic and dreamlike",5,6 March 2020,"I figured out the plot twist about half-way into the movie. This doesn't mean that the film was bad, but it was neither a masterpiece, nor a flop. Kubrick's skill as a director of memorable scenes shines through, but so does his inability to create convincing human behavior and interactions. Here are some of the positives and negatives of the film:
The characters of the doctor and his wife are not well-developed. Their child serves as an inanimate prop during the whole movie, and even disappears during the last scene, as her parents, and the viewer forget she ever existed. The conspiratorial motives of the wife and the personal dilemma and temptations of the doctor are not well written or well-acted. Their behavior seems drugged and dreamlike, even in scenes where they are supposed to be alert.+ The scenes of the masquerade were truly memorable and creepy - people who have watched this film a long time ago still remember these scenes and not much else. But unlike ""The Shining"", where the story is also memorable, this is pretty much all they remember.
The moral of the film is immediately apparent after the first ten minutes. The wife is able to overcome her temptations and remain loyal, whereas the husband is a clueless a-hole who needs to be tested and justly re-educated. As soon as the doctor starts to behave immorally towards his former schoolmate and his wife, we understand that the aim of the movie is to punish and re-educate the antihero. The doctor is frightened to death by his wife's ruse - she has staged the whole thing in order to test him, spark jealousy, and make him fear for her and appreciate her. He does. But he never gets a true understanding of what his wife wanted him to learn in the first place (to understand a woman's temptations, to appreciate her loyalty and feel jealous because of that).+ The plot twist is never explicitly stated - the wife's plot is never revealed, and it is up to the discerning viewer to spot the easter eggs and turn the cogwheels in their mind. With enough imagination, the viewer can even create alternative explanations, but overall, the wife's collusion with the masked men is more than apparent throughout the movie.
The movie is too slow, and I usually enjoy slow movies. But the plot could well be fitted into a 40-minute ""Twilight Zone""episode, without considerable change in the pace. The dialogue felt choppy, with lots of unnecessary pauses, and this added to the unnatural behavior of the actors. The slow pace was great in the lead-up to the masquerade scene, not so much in the doctor's sleepwalking around the city.Overall, it's a film that can make you feel smart, but this doesn't mean it's a masterpiece. A 5 out of 10 is a fair average between the overly positive and overly negative reviews on IMDB.",Eyes Wide Shut
447,buff-18,An overzealous attempt at an intellectually stimulating movie!,6,26 July 1999,"For the first time in a long time I was actually excited to see a movie. The hype surrounding EYES WIDE SHUT and the irony of Kubrick's death before the movie even came close to opening brought out the butterflies in my stomach as I walked to the box office and purchased my ticket. I even had to wait a week after it came out to go so that I could see it with my girlfriend who couldn't go see it with me the week before. We wanted to tickle our imaginations by seeing Kubrick's ""final masterpiece"". I walked out of the theater utterly disappointed. I like movies with intellectual stimulation. Movies that don't impress the viewer with computerized special effects (the Mummy) or gross-out comedy (There's something about mary) though those movies can be really great to see once...I like movies that become better and better every time you see them and leave you walking out of the theater thinking about the story.EYES WIDE SHUT left me walking out of the theater saying...what just happened. I've concluded...nothing. Nothing happened. This movie tried to create a complex web of internal angst but it was only confusion. Tom Cruise gets mad at his wife for having fantasies so he walks the streets for 2 days, shell out about $1000 loosely, doesn't take advantage of the two opportunities to get back at his wife which is his mission in the first place. He stumbles across a nightmarish orgy which is totally unrealistic and a complete a completely opposite turn from the way this movie was going. The orgy seemed to pose a threat to him and his family but near the end we find out that it was only to scare him into staying quiet.When all is said in done, nothing had happened. This movie fired blanks! I waited the entire movie for a plot and it just wasn't there. The sexual content of this movie was used in excess. Sex was everywhere and in such unusual and degrading forms that it made 'making love' look like a thing of the past. The closing line by nicole kidman ""we have to do something we haven't done in a while...f**k"" left me totally hating this movie. Even sex with his own wife is considered animalistic and degrading.EYES WIDE SHUT did not deliver at all. In the end, everything was the same as it was at the beginning except that tom and nicole (bill and alice) had a marriage that was even rockier than in the beginning.

This is not new when it comes to Kubrick. This latest piece of work is nothing less than a masterpiece. Yet again the focus is, somehow, not on the acting as such, but rather the plot. The plot is the real main character in this movie. As for the actors... Well I guess that most actors could have pulled off what Cruise and Kidman achieved. These are not the best actors in Hollywood. They are not bad, but there are better. But as I said: In this movie, it does not matter.I can not remember the last time I heard music that was as haunting as the score for this movie. It gave the movie an ethereal, supernatural quality that almost made you wish that something supernatural would happen in the movie -- not so much consciously as subconsciously. The eerie piano playing its strange melody, accompanying Cruise in that weird mask, just standing there, saying nothing. It kept me at the edge of my seat.As for the plot: It is a stroke of genius. Such a simple story as that of a couple who are in a rut. Nothing particularly exciting happens in their life. That is to say, before the movie truly begins. Then it becomes a fascinating look into emotional life, sexuality and psyche. The audience feels compelled both to loathe Cruise and to love him. All the while he explores his world, the world changes. My hat off and a deep bow to one of the greatest directors that ever livéd in the tide of times.

This is not a film an average moviegoer who checks his brain at the door will enjoy!  It is a psychological drama in which everything in the movie is meant to reflect the inner turmoil of the characters, Cruise and Kidman, onscreen.

450,maatmouse,Kubrick's last attempt at a conventional Hollywood film,7,29 November 2005,"Reading much in the tabloid press about the controversy and lies told about this film's production I was surprised to find, on watching it, that none of the rubbish was actually true. Kidman and Cruise make a halfway decent couple in this film, although one gets the impression particularly from Cruise's acting that he suffered far too many takes going wrong but aside from that, Kidman looks lovely and completely at ease with being pictured in the way that Kubrick portrays his film women - mostly naked but in a strangely non voyeuristic manner.That said, all the classic Kubrick touches are there. The sumptuous ballroom scene at Ziggler's and the equally beautiful masked party scene; liberal use of female nudity (seen in many Kubrick films, including The Shining, Clockwork Orange and occasionally in Barry Lyndon) but with a continental eye on it (as its incidental to the plot), little touches which crop up again and again (the well-lit Christmas tree, Cruise's ill-fated attempts to have sex as a means of getting back at his wife's revelation and the parties of the rich and successful (and masked)). Also there is the Kubrick trademark long tracking shot down a corridor and his use of nudity to shock. Kubrick was an incredibly talented and creative director who will be sorely missed by his fans.The plot is as complicated as ever. Cruise plays an ordinary suburban doctor whose former art dealer wife makes an uncomfortable revelation about an encounter she had on one of their holidays. Then Cruise, answering a call from a client/friend to attend to her dead father, finds himself dwelling over and over again on his wife's real or imagined infidelity as he travels around. He meets a succession of characters; a prostitute whom he almost sleeps with, a piano player in a jazz club who tells him about a masked party in another part of the country which he is playing at and then a costume supplier and his unruly daughter, followed by the anticipated so-called orgy sequence in which Cruise is, oddly, out of place and is 'rumbled'. The rest of the movie concentrates itself on Cruise trying to find out what went on at the party and whether the girl who 'sacrificed' herself for him really did.The only problem with me regarding this film was Cruise's acting. It is, at times, quite tired and he never gives a feeling that he is in any danger or his family are and he is concerned about it.",Eyes Wide Shut
451,bsbulldogs,"Wish my eyes had of shut, and remained shut",1,20 January 2017,"For ages, I had wanted to watch this film as I had heard a lot about it. A lot of that might have to do with the fact that the two stars of the film, Tom Cruise, and Nicole Kidman, were a real life married couple at the time of its release. I usually love Tom Cruise movies but this would have to be his worst film, by far. Totally not worth any hype as it was a snooze-fest, and two and a half hours of my life I will never, ever get back. If you ask me what the plot of this movie is, my response will be a simple shrug of the shoulders. The plot shouldn't even be mentioned as it is non-existent in my view. A 'fun' fact about this movie is it took 400 days to shoot, which is listed as a Guinness record. How it took 400 days to shoot this pretentious garbage is beyond me. Everything about it is horrible, acting, directing, plot, etc. You could tell the actors didn't want to be there with cringe-worthy dialogue. Avoid at all costs and a terrible way to send out a talented filmmaker like Stanley Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut
452,md_bunny1003,A classic thriller with many different meanings,7,5 June 2016,"Based on the 1926 novel 'Traumnovelle' by Austrian author, director Stanley Kubric changes the setting to fit the 90's New York keeping the flavour same. New York city doctor William Harford aka Bill (Tom Cruise) is successful in his profession, has married a former art curator Alice and has a beautiful 7 year old daughter Helena. All is picture perfect until Alice reveals that she was not perfectly loyal to her husband, and that she fantasized about a naval officer who she had just seen, but never even talked. She was ready to give up everything just for being with him for one afternoon, but instead, returned to her husband. And that she continues fantasizing about him. Learning about the near-infidelity of his wife, Bill is determined to find the thrill of having a relationship with someone else and sets out to do just the same. For that, he is prepared to go to any lengths, including the one which will prove to be a threat for his life, and his family.This movie has many layers, and includes the portrayal of many characters who are a part of Bill's journey. This is no blood or gore. Instead, it takes the classic route of a thriller, and mostly relies on human psychology. Accordingly, this movie cannot be specifically categorized as a thriller, suspense or classic. This is a mixture of all three. The entire film explores the relationships between humans, especially couples, and just how their mind can waver. It poses a question that how lethal is infidelity? Is near- infidelity equally dangerous? As this film basically is about sexual fantasies and obsession, few of the scenes are slightly cringe-worthy. (It received an R rating, so.. you might just want to keep your 'eyes wide SHUT').The attention paid to minute details is worth watching. This is a slow paced, dramatic movie, with ominous piano music in the background, so you will need plenty of patience to reach the conclusion. Also this movie depends heavily on psychology, so it is filled with ambiguous meanings. So interpret in your own way. However, compared to the powerful beginning, the ending slightly wavers. But it is an equally thought provoking one. After this movie ends, you might just continue thinking, untangling the chain of events. This one is completely different.",Eyes Wide Shut
453,cgcastanedo-75966,Posthumous film of Kubrick,10,29 May 2020,"The marital intimacy and sexual fantasies of a couple with 9 years of marriage is the theme chosen for analysis in Stanley Kubrick's posthumous film, ""Eyes Wide Shut""
A movie that, like the rest of the director's works, is also a highly made film and that took more than 2 years of production, with pristine setting, decoration, music and cinematography, set in NYC, but filmed in London.
The insinuation, the flirting, the jealousy and the desire, are integral parts of this dream, nightmare or trip towards the unimaginable, and that necessarily lead to a catharsis, where the reflections of their behaviors and actions return them towards a revaluation of their life as a couple.
The vigorous and revealing sequence within the bedroom sets the tone between harmony and chaos, between reality and fantasy.
Born in Manhattan, Kubrick was an innovator, passionate about film techniques, and a perfectionist in every way.
Although he only made 13 feature films throughout his life, his productions had an impact on society, are still current and continue to worry, to mention a few: Spartacus 1960, Lolita 1962, Dr. Strangelove 1964, 2001 A Space Odissey 1968, A Clockwork Orange 1971, The Shining 1980, Full Metal Jacket 1987. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a key film in the history of cinema, for Scorsese it is the 5th. best film of the 90's, for Kubrick himself, is his best work. A film that shows that with a great director, even Tom Cruise can achieve a good performance and not just pose. 4 days after showing the finished tape to Warner Bros executives, Kubrick dies.
Great performances by Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, starring as well: Sydney Pollack, Sky Dumont, Todd Field.",Eyes Wide Shut
454,faornelas,Eyes wide open to our feelings reality.,10,30 November 1999,"Don't close your eyes to this motion picture. Eyes Wide Shut really deserves your attention, as the Academy Awards'. Not because this is the last production by  director Stanley Kubrick, but due to the fact that Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey)  really did a great motion picture. Eyes Wide Shut is a movie that explores the psychological roots of the human feelings, concerning a very delicate subject, which is the treason. The eroticism present in the movie is not gratuitous. There is a purpose to be there and the purpose is to make us think about many things that surround our lives: from the prostitute contaminated with AIDS to the man who uses his own daughter to gain money, the movie constantly gives us something to think about. And there is a lot of time to think since the movie is very long, sometimes tedious. But nothing that we can not tolerate. Moreover, Kubrick presents a natural vision from one of the biggest myths of the human kind: the sex. In Eyes Wide Shut the sexuality is treated with extremely naturalness. It seems that Kubrick's last piece of art have great chances to receive some nominations for the next Academy Awards and succeed in some categories: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman acted extremely well, so were the supporting performances, the art direction and costume design are superb, the soundtrack is excellent, collecting some great musics that fit perfectly in the screen, following the story according to the movie plot; not to mention, of course, the direction. So, keep your eyes wide open.",Eyes Wide Shut
455,Jeff-197,Why is it called 'Eyes Wide Shut'? It is the best way to view it.,2,19 July 1999,"Don't buy the hype.  Too much drama in too little film.#1-The film is impeccable visually, but I could've gotten that in a postcard.#2- Neither Kidman nor Cruise can act.  (note Kidman's one word per hour rate of hyper-drama ranting, her annoying ""stoned"" monologue, and Cruise's emotionless, ""I'll tell you everything"" weep.)#3- You cannot make a DEEP movie about SHALLOW characters.  Before you dismiss me as not understanding the art, or the symbolism, let me say that I got it... all too clear.  The artsiness and high drama were unwarranted, slow, ornate, blatant, and overdone.  A good half of the people in my theatre laughed out loud in several ""high tension"" scenes, due to the ludicrous overproduction.  The film mocks itself.#4- Three reasons for the hype: -Kubrick's last film... how do you spit on his grave and say this film was weak??  - Nicole and Tom's relationship... extra naughty since we're peering into their lives??  - It is pretty racy... legitimized porn sells.In a nutshell, the film had a simple message, which was told through transparent, yet extranneous vehicles.  There was nothing behind the jumbled mass of art (or as one reviewer stated well... nothing beneath the mask).P.S.  If I'd have had to sit through that God-awful piano track ONE more time...",Eyes Wide Shut
456,Lo-Baby,Hideous,1,31 March 2000,"I mean no disrespect to the late Stanley Kubrick, but this film is a complete waste of time and money.  The acting wasn't bad, and there are a lot of talented people in this film.  The storyline was too strange to even fathom, and Class A actors (Cruise, Kidman, Pollack) gave good performances that couldn't save this ugly mess.  Upon leaving this movie in the theater, my date said, ""Not as bad as I thought it would be.""  That is the highest compliment he could pay this movie.They say truth is stranger than fiction, but this is just ridiculously worthless.In my humble opinion, the only portion of this film that had any merit was seeing Cruise and Kidman in scenes together. I got the impression these two are really good together both on-screen and off.In a nutshell:  Don't bother (unless you're an insomniac).",Eyes Wide Shut

Now, is it a good film? That depends on what you are looking for. This is a work of high authority and one can see Kubrick's influence in each frame. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play real life couple in high society New York(completely recreated on a London soundstage). They are invited a party where sexual dealings and offerings are exchanged which leads to an altercations of sorts later at home. What follows is a ride into a rabbit hole by Cruise's character involving sex cults, orgies, identities and obsessions. The film isn't as heavy handed as it appears and the pacing is very good. Worth a watch.",Eyes Wide Shut
458,lewismart,A absolutely cinematic masterpiece,10,5 September 2018,"I have always absolutely loved this film. The cinematography is gorgeous, the score is amazing. This has one of my favourite scores of any movie. The acting in this film is stellar. Tom cruise and Nicole Kidman put on great performances. The trailers to this film slightly confuses me because it makes it look like a straight up erotic thriller, however in my opinion, this is way more of a drama but has some dark and sinister moments. The sex scenes in this film are not meant to be stimulating. The sex scenes always have an eerie and creepy feel and look to them. There's also not too many sex scenes, of course apart from the mass orgy scene in the middle of the film but otherwise it's not too bad. But the whole film does have a main theme of sex throughout even tho ,apart from a few scenes, not a lot of sex scenes are shown.I've heard a lot of people complaining that the ending isn't very climatic. That you don't find out who the association are and there's no climatic thrill moment at the end. However I appreciate this. It makes the group more sinister and mystifying. Another reason why I like that it doesn't delve too much into who they are because it would take away from the fact that the film is about Kidman's character and Cruises characters sexual desires and frustrations and it'll become something else. Overall this is personally my favourite Kubrick film. I'm not saying it's the best but it's my personal favourite. I adore the films eeire and sinister feel throughout the whole film, even at a long time length, the movie doesn't drag and flows amazingly.",Eyes Wide Shut

This movie is a very complicated and weird one with strange twists and a great psychological evolution for each one of the two main characters. Tom Cruise is pretty good and Nicole Kidman is great in her role but, what is important to remember is that, this movie is a Stanley Kubrick movie and therefore, is not accessible for everyone. If you are expecting your average movie where all the answers are given or if you don't want to think about what is going on, don't see this movie. But, if you're in the market for an interesting psychological drama with great cinematography and a good script, then, see this movie. That is all I've got to say....",Eyes Wide Shut
460,Sailor-21,A sad end for Mr Kubrik's career,1,30 March 2000,"After seeing YWS, my first thought was that Mr Kubrik, gifted movie maker that he was, had not the slightest feeling for the nature of the bonds between real people.  My second thought was that Cruise and Kidman were perfect ""actors"" for this movie, as they are both perfect facades with absolutely nothing behind those facades.  Interesting.On reflecting on this movie overnight, my initial reactions are unchanged.The only interesting thing about this movie is that so many people seem to have found it interesting and/or excellent.  Even Mr Ebert has found nice things to say about this goofy movie.  Maybe he didn't want to say harsh things about a dead man's last movie, or wanted to show respect for Mr Kubrik.The movie utterly fails my first test for any movie - that it suspends disbelief, and draws me into the movie's reality.  Never during the movie was I drawn into it.  It was a long 2½  hour movie about Tom and Nicole being in a goofy Kubrik movie.The story-line, about a man 10 years married going off into a wild sexual fantasy because his wife confessed that she'd lusted after another man the year before, might have been credible in 1920 Vienna.  It's just plain silly when the setting is 1999 New York.I gather there was a lot of hullabaloo about digital alterations made to the orgy scenes. I don't understand the hullabaloo. The movie would have been no less goofy if full clinical details of sexual intercourse had been laid out on the screen.I've greatly admired several of Mr Kubrik's movies, and will probably see them again.  This sad piece isn't one of them.",Eyes Wide Shut

462,Curtize,A worthy addition to the Kubrick legacy.,8,9 August 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut - ***1/2Director Stanley Kubrick's final film is a probing, thoughtful, occasionally baffling exploration of  relationships.Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) are smoking pot one night, after a party during which both spouses flirted with others, when Alice reveals that she once had thoughts of cheating on her husband.  She did not act on the impulse, she explains, but she considered giving up her marriage and her daughter to pursue a mysterious Naval officer.  Dr. Bill is startled by this, but finds himself summoned to a house call before he is able to respond to the revelation.  That night Bill finds himself caught up in a series of increasingly bizarre circumstances. 1) A grieving woman makes a pass at Bill right beside her father's deathbed (literally.)  2) Bill is accosted by a gang of young hooligans, 3) He is propositioned by a prostitute named Domino (Vanessa Shaw.)  He goes back to her place, but a phone call from the wife dampens the mood.  4) Bill meets up with an old friend named Nick Nightingale (Todd Field.)  Nick is a struggling piano player who explains that he has a gig later that night at, well. an orgy.  It seems that Nick plays blindfolded.  5) Bill memorizes the password needed for admittance to the orgy and quickly sets out to acquire the prerequisite attire (tuxedo, cloak, and mask.)  Apparently he is after a little revenge nookie.  6) Bill visits the Rainbow costume store in the middle of the night and encounters Milich (Rade Sherbedgia,) the eccentric owner, and his daughter (Leelee Sobieski.)  7) Finally, Bill arrives at the big ""party.""  I will not spoil the rest of the film.  Let me say simply that Bill's covert presence at the orgy is uncovered, and he finds himself afraid for his own life as well as the lives of others.  The final third of the film chronicles Bill's search for answers:  Who are these people?  What happened to that mysterious woman?  Where is Nick Nightingale?Eyes Wide Shut has Stanley Kubrick's fingerprints all over it.  All of his signature traits are here:  The pregnant pauses, the dramatic silences, the somber music, the stillness of the camera, and - most of all - the cold detachment.  It is highly Kubrickian (to coin a phrase) in its refusal to editorialize.  What is the point?  What is this film about?  Kubrick never tells us.  He simply presents us with the facts and lets us draw our own conclusions.  As a result, every viewer comes away with a  different message, because every viewer goes in with a different frame of reference.Much has been made of the technical production of this film.  Yes, it is true that Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh were cut from the movie and recast.  Yes, it is true that Stanley Kubrick filmed numerous takes - sometimes more than 100.  Yes, the shoot lasted for several years.  Yes, it was filmed entirely in London, even though it is set in New York City. And yes, some of the cloaked figures in the orgy scene were digitally inserted to cover strategic areas and thereby earn an R rating - as opposed to an NC-17.  But none of this matters.  What matters is what ended up on the screen.  And what ended up on the screen is an artful, insightful, and mysterious film.",Eyes Wide Shut
463,mailbob,Hard to keep eyes open.,4,29 May 2000,"With the hype last year - magazine covers and all - I expected something more. Much more.I give the film a generous 4. I thought it failed on several counts: Tom Cruise has never been a favorite of mine. In The Firm, at least, he came closer to character playing a smart-ass attorney, but his self-assured semi-smirk and perfect Hollywood looks don't fit the character of a young doctor. Both the Cruise and Kidman characters were superficial to the extreme, with no more personality than cartoon characters.The characterizations were bad enough, but the acting didn't help. The two leads in particular seemed acutely self-conscious. Whenever Kidman spoke, she exuded ""I'm a sexy actress playing a REALLY hot role - listen to my every profound word!"" I could prepare a snack before she finished a sentence. By the time she did, I was so irritated I nearly lost track of what she was saying. And her intoxicated demeanor while dancing at the party with a stranger - who came off as some hack's quick-fix cliché - was simply embarrassing.As if the pace of the dialogue wasn't slow enough, questions had to be repeated - i.e., ""What do you....think?"" (pregnant pause) ""What.....do... I think?"" ""Yes, what.... do you.... think?""  Over and over and over again. Please, not EVERY word is such a big deal. The result is a pretentiousness that simply overwhelems. Is it really necessary for this film to take nearly 3 hours? Not if the characters sounded like real people instead of robots stuck on repeat.  I'm reminded of Kubrick's revolving spaceship in 2001, accompanied inexplicably by a Strauss waltz. I remember wondering - will this scene ever end? Unfortunately, I had the same feeling in this film, many times.  That shouldn't happen in any film, let alone one with a subject matter that should - de facto - keep everyone enthralled, and one that is the last film and the crowning achievement of an important director's life.What a shame. Sexuality - as opposed to sex -- is not often dealt with at all, let alone successfully. I kept hoping for a hook to reality, an honest statement. Instead, the plot degenerated  into a convoluted hodgepodge which, while titillating (no pun intended), was never sufficiently explained or resolved.I would have rated it lower than a 4, but for its ground breaking attempt as a serious treatment of sexuality. For a main stream film, it was bold. But again, self-consciously. For me, nothing rang true. As for nudity - frontal nudity, yes. Breasts, plenty of 'em. Sex, er, maybe. But men's privates are still apparently just that - private. And sex - weird and not at all erotic, and only filmed from strategic angles. There is still that familiar and conspicuous holding back, not just of nudity, but of the treatment of sexuality itself. Come on, we're supposed to be grown up. And this is supposed to be a film about a grown-up subject. Unfortunately, it came off more like an adolescent's wet dream.",Eyes Wide Shut
464,mifamily6,Ever watch a Kubrick film... on weed...,9,1 June 2004,"Just kidding.  No, I didn't watch EYES WIDE SHUT on weed but I have seen it many times.  It definitely gets better with each repeated viewing.  The scenes are so well directed and the pacing is perfect.  No wonder it took 15 months to film.  One night, I couldn't sleep and EYES WIDE SHUT was on HBO, so I watched the entire movie knowing I had to go to school the next day.  I noticed so many things that I didn't notice before.  What a grand movie. Really makes you think.  You can kiss my butt if you think Tom Cruise is a bad actor and I think this was the start of Nicole Kidman's great roles.

465,Sophoclaw,"Bill is existing but not living, takes the world for granted.",7,2 January 2011,"Unfortunately Kubrick didn't have the chance to finish this film. But if he had I'm sure we would've had a chance to grasp its meaning better. My guess, after having watched the film several times, is that Kubrick would've have wanted us to get the following message: Bill (Cruise) is living in a kind of virtual existence and doesn't appreciate what he has or better said what he has inherited as a member of the western civilization. Alice (Kidman) is portrayed as a victim in her role as a member of the woman gender. This comes clear as the film develops when we see how women are treated all along the film. If they are not nice, faithful and obedient housewives, they are hookers that can be bought and misused more or less like animals or slaves. It is their flesh we are interested in. Almost all of the main scenes in this film focus on these concepts. Bill ignores his wife until she confesses some thoughts and flirtations on other men. He reacts as if some of his possessions were about to be robbed and immediately tries to take revenge by being himself unfaithful to her. Suddenly she is real and exists but instead of giving her love, only tries to cheat on her in a miserable and in the end in a failed manner. Now, this is a very difficult theme for a film at any level and Kubrick as a perfectionist as he was, embarked it in an analytical level going slowly step by step, scene by scene systematically to make us understand the implications of the plot. Unfortunately this gives a rather theatric and passive feeling about the whole thing. It seems we are watching a heavy Ibsen theatric play from the 18th century and not a film that is supposed to be modern. This fact is also reflected on the end that is supposed to be a climax after all these steps. It is not, it is tame and disappointedly anticlimax. It is just showing us the indifference or the difficulty about solving the issues this film is dealing with. If just Kubrick had lived enough time to finish it properly.",Eyes Wide Shut

But the guy sure did his homework, which set him light years apart from reliable studio hacks...so compared to a Joel Schumacher, er, maybe Kubrick was a genius. But what the heck's up with his swansong? ""Eyes Wide Shut"" opened promisingly enough. Medium shot of Nicole Kidman's butt, touchdown. Never considered her a decent actress, never considered her attractive, but always considered her creepy, too bony and not feminine enough. Wowzers, though, what a backyard. If only Kubrick kept the camera rolling on Kidman's spectacular pooper. Oh well.What Kubrick did film was a mystery. Figuratively speaking. As in, ""T'hell's the film ABOUT?"" Short answer: It's about three freakin' hours, man. Three freakin' hours.Conceptually? Fidelity or betrayal or something vague delivered like a melting glacier. Although, coming from the calculating director who upstaged Scatman Carrothers with a can of Calumet baking power in ""The Shining,"" was there something more going on? Did Kubrick intend ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to be a farce? Tom Cruise and Kidman were their spectacular lightweight selves, emotions ranged from A to B. Stuck out like sore thumbs amidst naturalistic, talented performers. Was that the joke?? Perhaps looking for farce is reaching too far for subtext. But why the heck else would Kubrick cast movie stars in the leads instead of actors?? Don't know about you, but I'm tired of posing questions regarding ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Art's art and fun's fun but comes a point when something impenetrable becomes a bore. Self-indulgent bore, to boot.Yes, only Kubrick could make ""Eyes Wide Shot."" But then, only Kubrick could make sex boring. And I mean boring. Aside from one genuinely creepy scene full of dramatic tension in a costume shop after hours, rest of the film's an unsatisfying snoozebomb.And the ending? My interpretation (on the basic plot level) differed completely from that of two other people. So three different people viewing at the same time came up with three completely different reasons for the final scene. Testament to a fantastic filmmaker who challenges the imagination? Not as much as a ludicrous narrative that had no place to go logically. Big difference.Don't get me wrong, Kubrick kicked some out of the park. ""Clockwork,"" ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""2001"" showed what he could do on his best day. Unfortunately ""Eyes"" wasn't one of those days.",Eyes Wide Shut

I have always enjoyed Eyes Wide Shut even though after my first and even second viewing I was left with an anti climatic feeling, however the film stays with you and you begin to think about it. Just like all his other works there is something that keeps you going back and discovering something else you did not notice before. His films change as you change with age, giving you new perspectives on not just the films subjects but also your own life. This film is immaculately directed and among the best films to be ever be lit, the constant use of Christmas lights in almost every scene gives the film a dreamy like feeling. I know that Kubrick was looking to change the medium of film again, and the lighting in this film certainly did that. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play their parts well, and like all Kubrick characters there is something off about them. The film like 2001 A Space Odyssey, and the Shining is very much left open to interpretation, Kubrick liked to make his films as ambiguous and allow the viewer to make up their own minds as to what they have just watched. I highly recommend this film, especially to film students. It is created by someone who has a lifetime of knowledge in the film industry and was known as a perfectionist.

It is a shame new movies will never be made like that again; the film world got a little lighter after this past spring.

473,Elder_Yautija,It lacks Kubrick's typical touch,7,13 November 2006,"Eyes Wide Shut is not a bad movie. The story is engaging, the leading actors deliver good performances, the photography is exceptional...but it still lacks something. It lack's the final touch that makes a Stanley Kubrick picture a standalone thing. I mean....if you watch either A Clockwork Orange or 2001 A Space Odyssey (or Barry Lyndon, or any other early masterpiece Kubrick has delivered), at the end of the movie you're gonna be like:""Oh, my god! Was this movie for real or did I just dream it?"", your mouth wide open and tears of joy shedding from your eyes. After watching this one I felt instead like I've been watching a good movie, telling an intriguing story and directed with professionality. That's all. Nothing special. Nothing even in the same league of other Kubrick movies. It lacks Kubrick's magic.Bottom line: if this was directed by any other unknown guy it would be getting a 7. Disappointing.5/10",Eyes Wide Shut

475,reporterman2000,Sexual film noir,9,22 August 2003,"The only adequate description I can think of for ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is that it's a sexual film noir, an erotic mystery wrapped in an X-rated enigma. Tom Cruise is the befuddled detective, fumbling his way through the darkness searching for the light, and Nicole Kidman is the femme fatale whose sexuality holds the key to all. Or does it?I never expected Stanley Kubrick to release a mainstream movie that contained graphic sex on the order of ""Basic Instinct,"" though I would like to see the European version (minus the fake-looking digital forms). This is another intellectual film from the maker of ""2001,"" and it's fascinating and in many ways appalling. It also has a seriously twisted sense of humor ... notice the way a ringing telephone almost always prevents Cruise from going over the edge into infidelity.Martin Scorsese has said that the whole movie is a dream, that not a moment takes place w/in ""reality."" An interesting point of view. But who's dreaming? Both Cruise and Kidman, I say, with Kubrick weaving the two dreams together, and with Kidman emerging as the dominant partner at the end. (She has one of the best closing lines in all of movies, right up there with ""Forget it, Jake ..."")Critics who say Tom Cruise is terrible here are way off base. Dr. Harford has gone into himself; his passions exist with his own imagination -- he is literally walking with his eyes wide shut, obsessing over the mental picture of Kidman having sex with another man, and he's terrific. Kidman, meanwhile, deserved the supporting actress Oscar for her performance here. The scene where she destroys Cruise with her sex fantasy is just outstanding. Rade Serbedgia is memorably creepy as the late-night costume salesman, and Sidney Pollack excels as the scary rich guy who may (or may not) be manipulating things behind the scenes. Every performance, really, is a gem.""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not a plot-driven movie; it's a story, and a character study. Some find it boring because a car doesn't explode every 5 seconds. They can watch ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" This was the final work of a master filmmaker, and it's as great as it is weird.(Footnote: watch this as a double feature with ""American Beauty."")",Eyes Wide Shut

Since it was free and all I have no complaints.  Some people had told me this movie had no plot, but I thought it had a deep and intricate plot!There were many parts of the movie that were left unexplained, or they don't explicitly say what happened (don't you just hate that?)... so that's mostly why I didn't like it that much.  But after reading other people's interpretations and discussions on the bbs, I got some insight on what the hell was going on. Also... the movie was long.  2 and 1/2 hours.  and halfway through I was wondering when it would be over. To end on a more positive note, I like most Tom Cruise movies and he was great in this one as well.  So his presence redeemed this movie somewhat and made the 2 and 1/2 hrs seem less of a drag. I definitely would not recommend renting or buying this movie to anyone UNLESS you're a Cruise or Kidman fan.  If it was some other actor that I'm not a particularly big fan of, then I would definitely regret having wasted those 2.5 hours of my life.",Eyes Wide Shut

I was on the edge of my seat a good deal throughout the movie, only to have to sit back many, many times as the scenes dragged on and on and on and on. With no pay off time and time again, I began to wonder what the good Dr.'s problem was.Woody Allen spices his films about sex and relationships with humour; Kubrick seems to have one sexually deviant scene after the other - none of which fits with the other, none of which fits the Dr.'s personality.Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise in the movie in many ways - all the classic Cruise moves (running hand through hair, plunking his face into his hands that rest on his knees).  Nicole Kidman was unnecessarily nude many times --- basically, the lead actors were pleasant to look at.I've been told since watching this film that Cruise's character was the the one dreaming, while Kidman's was the one who actually went through her part - the opposite of the portrayal.  That helps make some sense of the movie, although I saw no clues to this effect.Overall, lots of sexual tension, nudity, and energy, with no payoff.",Eyes Wide Shut

While there are some attention-grabbing scenes such as the one in Victor Ziegler's pool room, too much of the film has the feeling that they are trying to fill out time.  Nicole Kidman gives a good performance and Sydney Pollack is very good, but Tom Cruise is, well, the same old cocky, one-dimensional Tom Cruise.  Unknown, bit actors kept showing him up in scene after scene; it got a little embarrasing.  If he wasn't good looking, he would have a hard time getting work.I guess if you have 2.5 hours to kill and don't mind a movie that takes you nowhere, you might enjoy this film.",Eyes Wide Shut

Everyone seemed to be fully involved in who their characters were, and you could tell some time had been spent developing this.  But it still turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!  I can give you a plot summary in maybe four steps:Tom Cruise walks around New York to one of two locations and spends ludicrous amounts of money.Tom Cruise says he's a doctor.Tom Cruise thinks of Nicole Kidman.Repeat if necessary until you have thoroughly wasted 2 1/2 hours of the audience's time.The soundtrack was just some maniac on a piano banging a note at a time as hard as he could.  The only noticeable song, Chris Isaak's ""Bad, Bad Thing"" was a bit of irony in that his characters never actually DO bad things. They just think about them or watch, and I'm sorry, but that's terribly boring.  I will do my best to remember this film for the stellar performances and not the depressing technical failures.  2 out of 10",Eyes Wide Shut
480,Piper-10,STANLEY KUBRICK IS MY HERO!,10,9 September 1999,"This movie rocks. That Kubrick has died makes me very, very sad. Now, I'm only left with David Lynch and possibly Terry Gilliam. Like Kubrick, Lynch and Gilliam (and there are a few others, I know, but I'm trying to keep this rant short) seem to understand one thing: If you're really into making a great movie, you're usually going to run the risk of offending your Titanic-loving, Backstreet-boys-obsessed mainstream audience. The simple problem is that people too often equate entertainment with easy feelings. I'm sorry, but I absolutely hate the fact that every single blockbuster dictates my feelings to me. Listen, hey--James Horner has that fake chorus singing so happily; it sure is great that Old Rose is going to see Bill Paxton. yippee-yay! What a load of crap. here it is, folks, plain and simple: Titanic: three-hour love story that shows you how two young punks had a little fling before a ship sank (and THAT's the epic here?) Verdict: Loved by billions everywhere.Eyes Wide Shut: three-hour love story that shows you how two married people came to terms with each others lust, and leaves you the space to interpret different sexual situations on your own. Verdict: Hated and despised by billions everywhere. Well, fine. If all you people really want is to chew bubble-gum and watch stupid, cheesy relationships that have no substance, no character, and no depth, then go right ahead and bash Eyes Wide Shut. Me? I'm building a shrine to Kubrick. Like it or not, the man never catered to the groundlings in the theater. He just made breathtaking films.

Overall, the acting and atmosphere are a bit over the top and the slow pace detracts a bit, but as any work of art, the spectator needs to fathom a message for him or herself.The central theme explores the theme of how much truth one should share with ones lover.  Can one live with a charade, especially with ones most intimate confidant?  Whether a sexual fantasy or an entanglement in a murder, do we kill a part of ourselves by lying or not revealing this truth, or does sanity necessitate a scheme of white lies within and without oneself.This film makes a daring attempt to get people talking about what they really think and feel.",Eyes Wide Shut

484,BobStage,A Legendary Film from a Legendary Director,8,18 October 2007,"I have heard from people I know that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is either a great film or a bad movie. Having seen it myself, I would say that this is one of Kubrick's best. The film deals with the topics of sex, trust, secrets, and temptation. Tom Cruise plays a doctor, married with a seven-year-old daughter in New York City. He takes his wonderful life for granted, until his wife admits to have almost cheated on him. Stunned by this piece of news, he is drawn into a dark world of temptation, whether it is with a prostitute, or with his patients' daughter. Finally, he is drawn to this mysterious mansion where an orgy of masked people satisfy their lust. In the discussion of art and filming, this movie is a masterpiece. The atmosphere is so mysterious, so dark, and very strange. There are some scenes that sent shivers down my spine. One thing I liked in particular was the conversations Tom Cruise's character had with characters such as the hotel clerk, the Russian store owner, and his old friend. One disappointment was Nicole Kidman. I just did not like her in this film, for a number of reasons. Her acting did not impress me as much as Tom's did. I was glad that much of the scenes were focused on Tom Cruise's character rather than Nicole's. She is probably the biggest reason that I would rate the film 9 out of 10 rather than 10 out of 10.However, it is a very good film overall. Stanley Kubrick died believing that he had made the best movie of his life with ""Eyes Wide Shut"". I'd say he was not too far from the truth. This film is brilliant, and it is a pity that it was not as appreciated as it should be.",Eyes Wide Shut

Don't let spiteful reviewers fool you with their pathetic attempts to gain notoriety by bashing this film.

Of course, I could see some standard signs of beautiful Kubric genius throughout and by the end, I grew to enjoy it highly.  I liked it even more after it was over and the film was wrapped up and I had the whole picture. What a fascinating movie!  There are a few things that should've been done differently (look at me second-guessing Stanley Kubrick!) - like Cruise's entire evening should've been more dream-like, like he was unsure it even happened.  There was touches of that though, so it's all cool.  Also don't you think Harvey Keitel would've been perfect in the Pollack's role?

Now here is our good doctor (Cruise) helping a naked woman recover from an overdose, sees her a few hours later (as she is apparently hooking on the streets) doesn't recognize her even when he accompanies her to her bedroom to engage her services. And later when this Amazon Hooker attends an orgy she saves him from a fate worse than life.  This particular female had one hell of a constitution to hook, attend an orgy, after she nearly died a few hours earlier.  It does stretch the imagination.

If this came from an unknown filmmaker, people would be calling it pretentious, self-indulgent, boring, and pointless. There's no way anyone would get past that ridiculous orgy party without rolling their eyes. But since it's from the untouchable ""Kubrick"", it's a work of genius. Well, sure it's boring, but that's Kubrick. Yeah, the pace is mind-numbingly slow but Kubrick can do no wrong!Yes, the film is photographed beautifully. Gorgeous set design. The camerawork is steady. OK...that's all dandy.What about the story? Is that not an intregal part of the movie experience? Who cares, right? For nearly three hours we're treated to Tom Cruise walking around the streets of what's supposed to be New York, encountering all kinds of unrelated people and circumstances. Yawn. Finally there's a lackluster wrap-up at the end which is supposed to explain everything. By that point we're so bored it doesn't even matter.And every scene goes on way too long. There's a scene near the beginning where Kidman and Cruise smoke pot and get in an argument. It takes Kidman about ten minutes to speak three or four sentences. Everything is: ""And...(super dramatic pause)...I had....(longer pause)...a...(pauses, closes her eyes)....dream..."" Get to the bloody point, woman! She's the worst offender, but almost every conversation in the movie is like this. And this is for almost three hours! It's very frustrating.What amazed me was the audience reaction to the film. I've heard nothing but praise. (Of course I live in L.A., where every young assistant and gopher is a Kubrick wannabe) Look, Kubrick was a great director. DR. STRANGELOVE, THE SHINING, and FULL METAL JACKET are some of my favorite films of all time. But the man is not God. He is not beyond a poor film.

490,tango1,"Eyes Wide Shut is is far from being the ""sexual thriller""",5,19 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut is is far from being the ""sexual thriller"" as it's been billed. Also, there are many other misconceptions about the film that should be laid to rest; like the one about Cruise and Kidman being Psychiatrists (they're not), or that there are several very erotic orgy scenes (there aren't), or that this is Kubrick's finest film (it isn't).There *is* lots of female frontal nudity (sorry ladies, no naked men), and sex is certainly ""suggested"", but you never really SEE any of it. At least not in the way people think. There are far more erotic films out there, and if that is what you are seeking I would recommend ""Henry and June"", or something French. You aren't going to get any titillation here.This movie is far more complicated than simple ""thriller""... it isn't even a very typical Kubrick mind f**k. There are elements of Kubrick's films scattered throughout, and it has a creepy coldness that is both fascinating and uncomfortable. The musical score is as close to excellent as you can get in creating that creepy, cold mood... well done.Tom Cruise's performance was laughable at times, and painfully lame at others. He was certainly not believable as a physician... no medical doctor I know runs around calling himself a ""doctor"" the way Cruise does, and his paternalistic mannerisms with his patients are completely unbelievable in the 30-something character. Perhaps the problem was partially the script (which was awkward and comedic at times), but Cruise is also not even half the actor people say he is.Kidman was indeed quite good in the relatively small role she had, however I am not sure I needed to see her naked behind so often as it was shown. Kubrick must have been highly interested in her ass, or thought film go-ers would be. Don't know that it adds anything to the content of the film, but male audience members will no doubt love it.Some great ""cameos"" in this movie: Alan Cumming as the bellboy. Rade Serbedzjia as Milich (costume shop owner) Leelee Sobieski as Milich's daughter (a Lolita if ever there was one, and she doesn't say hardly a word!)If you are a true Kubrick fanatic you should probably see this movie, but then again maybe not.For those who haven't experienced some of Kubrick's finer moments in film making, I'd forgo ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and rent the far more creepy ""Clockwork Orange"", or my personal fave ""Dr. Strangelove"", and of course ""2001, A Space Odyssey"".Meanwhile, I'll reserve my judgement for this summer's best film after seeing ""The Blair Witch Project""...

It doesn't blatantly tug on the heartstrings or the libido. It doesn't attach itself to a genre. It doesn't teach any lessons.

For me, this film raised the bar on good cinematography, so much so that I found myself thinking that the Lord of the Rings films actually didn't convey mise-en-scene well enough (I was surprised to find that simply showing grand vistas of fantastic places/creatures wasn't good enough for me). The pictures in Eyes Wide Shut alone sucked me into Kubrick's world completely. The film made me think that on most films each film frame conveys primarily one color/tint (they look bluish, reddish, greenish, yellowish etc.). The scenes in Eyes Wide Shut, on the other hand, captured in the same frame multiple colors (including black) so well that, it felt like the film had a higher resolution than it actually did (because my eye could resolve more details). The overall effect is that the images felt more real than those of most other films. Actually ""surreal"" is more appropriate, because Kubrick didn't settle for mere realism. It is said the film takes place in a dreamscape, partly *because* of the gorgeous color saturation.The film itself is pure Kubrick. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is all about the mystery and intrigue, never about the clear resolution.

It doesn't show all the programming, torture, microchip implants and demons that are put into the souls/bodies to get them to become the slaves that they are, but it does uncover the veil covering some things.See reviews by Illuminati researchers online for more.The world is not at it seems and such things as portrayed in this movie definitely do go on - more often then one might imagine.Kubrick died 'suddenly' before the movie was released - a day beforehand? Strange to say the least. Some say that he was punished for revealing too much. (Interestingly, Aaron Russo of America: Freedom to Fascism fame also died after he made his documentary exposing the Illuminati's tools of control, especially in the USA.) A movie well done and believable because it is so close to reality - the reality that most do not see and may never see.

""I have seen one or two things in my life but never, never anything like this.""",10,25 September 2005,"I'm sitting here trying to come up with a clever comment about this movie to make you want to see it. When in reality it doesn't matter what I say. As Stallone would say ""I'm at least half a bum."" The truth to it is, it kind of makes me sad that I'll probably never see another movie that affects so much. Never experience a film that 6 years after it's release, I still can not forget.To say the most, it's a powerful film. The directing is world class. The camera work is haunting and the soundtrack gives me chills. It's Cruise at his finest. He is so convincing that one might actually believe that this guy is Doctor Bill Harford and this really did happen to him. And that my friends is the definition of acting. The seriousness of the situation fades away with a stern smile as the plot thickens.To say the least it is one of those movies you could watch over and over again. To be honest with you, I didn't buy it the first time I saw it. I thought it was good, but not great. Then one day I was bored, so I decided to see it again. And that's when it happened. Kubrick came alive. I became infected by his genius and captivated by Cruise's portrayal. His realization and his detail.It's hard to pick my favorite scene in the movie. I couldn't pretend if I tried. I particularly love the opening party scene. That leads to a ""Baby did a bad bad thing"". Cruise being assaulted on the street being so eloquently called a fag. The prostitute. From the piano bar to the costume shop. And finally, the unionized orgy party, that I find hard to believe doesn't really exist. Maybe only guys like Kubrick or Cruise will ever really know if they do or not.Many people might disagree with me when I say Eyes Wide Shut is one of the greatest films. But how come I think it is every time I watch it? To me, it's more than a beautiful work of art. More than a visceral painted picture or a haunting melody.

And that is just what it is - endlessly fascinating.I have been waiting for Eyes Wide Shut since the announcement. So when I sat down in the theater my hopes were high, even though the rave reviews were rather few.The Harford's goes to party and when they come home Alice reveals a sexual fantasy she's been having. That scene is really Scenes from a Marriage on drugs with a Kubrickian twist. After that it becomes a high class thriller.Both Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman delivers first rate performances. So do the entire cast, in every minor role. Sydney Pollack is much better suited for the part of Victor Ziegler than Harvey Keitel would be. So is Marie Richardson compared to Jennifer Jason Leigh who was originally casted as Marion.I would like to give special praise to Marie Richardson and Vanessa Shaw who plays Domino. Both is in the film not much longer than approximately six minutes. But they do so much of their parts.The acting, the camerawork, the editing, the very effective use of music (and not use of music in some sequences), the solo piano in particular.

Based on my experience ofhis many previous works, I have to believe that Stanley Kubrickdid, indeed, create precisely what he wanted to create, which isin itself disturbing.  I can still hear the haunting piano musicin the background, which I sometimes found annoying andsometimes found the perfect punctuation for the one-dimensionalcharacter in the foreground.  At times I felt absorbed; at othertimes, bored.  Some aspects I considered complex; others overlysimplistic and shallow.  I found Sydney Pollock's performance tobe the most powerful, though his time onscreen was limited;Nicole Kidman's, usually outstanding and sometimes weird; TomCruise's, an indication that he was in over his head, both as acharacter and as an actor.

500,abdulio,interesting; but no dr. strangelove,8,9 August 1999,"finally, about three weeks ago, kubrick gives the film world his final opus, eyes wide shut. after seeing it a couple of times, i enjoyed the film, but it's definitely not as good as dr. strangelove, 2001, full metal jacket, or a clockwork orange. it's very reminiscent of barry lyndon. the stunning set designs, color, photography, lighting, and glacial pace. the grainy film was interesting, too. it made you feel as if you just woke up from a nap and are looking around. cruise was serviceable, as he appears in virtually every minute of the film. but at times he seemed to try too hard for melodrama. kidman was very impressive as his wife, and should have been more involved in the film. the editing felt uneven towards the end of the film, and there was one scene in which the shadow of a crew man entered the picture. surprising errors from a kubrick film, since he is notorious for his meticulousness. if he was still alive, i'm sure these would have been improved on. the ending felt forced and abrupt, especially the pool scene where they tried to answer some of the questions posed. the movie would have been more effective if there was more evidence of distrust between the couple. the message kubrick is implying about infidelity may seem dated to many, especially in the late nineties. some darkly funny moments that seem to poke fun at the media who question cruise's sexuality e.g. college homophobes, hotel clerk, hooker's friend. and last, it was just 20 minutes too long, but i never really felt bored. in conclusion, eyes wide shut should be seen by any serious film buff. i recommend ""after hours"" by scorsese, which depicts another man lost in a surreal sexual underworld. it's funnier and more poignant.p.s. pay attention to the scene where cruise is in the coffee house. you'll be surprised at who you see sitting.",Eyes Wide Shut
501,Schmuck-4,A dabble in the occult,6,8 August 1999,"For a Stanley Kubrick film, this one is very different to his earlier works, at least those that I've seen. It's disappointing to say that this final stroke is probably his worst film. Not to say that it's all bad, but it pales in comparison to films such as THE SHINING, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and DR STRANGELOVE. EYES WIDE SHUT tells the story of a married couple living in New York City who are experiencing some marital trauma. The husband, played by Tom Cruise, goes on a strange tour of the sexual underground of NYC, and although he never actually has sex with anyone but his wife, he becomes entangled with some bizarre cult populated by solemn figures in black cloaks, hoods and masks. We never get to find out much about this cult, but maybe that's a part of the film's alluring sense of the mysterious. It seems to represent a break away from the mundane drudgery of everyday life, and a risky dabble in the occult. But unfortunately it's nothing special; by far the most skilfully directed scene was the one in which Cruise infiltrates the cult and bears witness to their eerie and somewhat disturbing rituals, but the rest of the film had a somewhat plodding pace. Kidman's acting left much to be desired; even in scenes when she was supposed to be sober she had a habit of talking very slowly. Quite a mild film when compared to Kubrick's other works. Still quite entertaining and, as it were, a break away from the mundane drudgery of everyday Hollywood movies, and a risky dabble in more unusual films. Two and a half stars out of four.",Eyes Wide Shut
502,Skeptic-8,Pack your No-Doz.,3,25 July 1999,"Kubrick was a recluse, and only a recluse could create a film whose sexual sensibilities are so firmly and convincingly lodged in the 1950's.  How else can we fathom a premise made ludicrous by the sexual revolution of the last 30 years:  that the husband portion of a cosmopolitan, wealthy, and beautiful pair, married many years, is impelled to expore layers of sexual debauchery merely by his wife's recounting of her sexual fantasy about another man?Debauchery of the sort imagined by Kubrick is either common as house dust(prostitution) or untitillating (incomprehensible and unerotic rituals in a Story-of-O sort of mansion).  What is the message the film is conveying through the use of all this sexual dullness?  That we should look before we leap?  Cherish what we have?  Be careful of compromising our moral spheres? If this was Kubrick's essay on moral ambivalence, I give it a ""D"" for failure to establish a convincing premise, a useful narrative thread, or any meaningful message.",Eyes Wide Shut

Friend: ""It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.""The ""nice feeling"" that the Man's friend, here, is referring to is perhaps, the Sense of Freedom that a man with No Attachments whatsoever, can enjoy without hesitations or boundaries...The Power to walk away from Commitments.Right at the beginning, the social event where the Man (who is a doctor) and his friend meet each other after many years, is an Anonymous Party, where no one knows anyone and hence one could make willful choices of actions towards perceiving that illusive personal Happiness he/she is in the quest for. This Party could be an Allusion to that ideal place where one hides away from the others for a while and does what one desires for experiencing Happiness, and it could be some Flirtation, Sex or a seemingly harmless combination of Heroin and Coke ...or just a passion for playing a plain Piano.The Man and his beautiful Wife, return from the Party, but only after having their Commitments for each-other seriously challenged, and they discuss, question and probe anything that defines any aspect of a marital/sexual relationship between a Man and a Woman. Love and Loyalty. Expectations. Jealousy. Wife's (illusive) desire for Security and Commitment, Human being's Polygamous Nature and the futile attempt to control it. The Wife even dreams of her subconscious desire to stray more and more away from the Man, mentally and physically.Realizing that the Wife is not entirely faithful to him, the Man gets involved into adventures of his own. But will he be really as deceptive as one of the earlier lines in the movie says: ""One of the charms of marriages is that it makes Deception a necessity for both the parties."" ?...Does their marriage survive this Storm ?Watch it in Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut (1999)'",Eyes Wide Shut

505,ca_dale,A love-hate relationship,7,14 October 2006,"After watching Eyes Wide Shut (EWS) I found myself extremely divided over how to properly evaluate it.Let me start by looking at what I consider EWS's strong points.Aesthetically EWS is a stunning film. Kubrick's signature tracking shots and creative use of colour and imagery make for many memorable scenes. Lots of symbolism is employed, such as the sexually charged paintings, and of course the wide assortment of masks and costumes. The soundtrack is also perfectly suited to the atmosphere of each scene. The use of a slow but rising piano beat is particularly effective at conveying the mystery and uncertainty that Tom's Cruise's character finds himself in and I found myself replaying it in my head for a long time after my first viewing.Now for the not so good.My biggest gripe with EWS is its often painfully slow pacing. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, EWS has very little actual dialogue, instead relying largely on imagery to guide you through the journey. The problem is that what dialogue there is is not very interesting or relevant. Why does Tom Cruise's character have to repeat every bloody thing that others tell him? This combined with the at times agonizingly slow delivery of the lines frustrated the **** out of me. I can understand what Kubrick was going for (a dreamlike surreal atmosphere) but he fails to sell it clearly and convincingly enough, and the end result is tediousness rather than suspense.Honestly this is a real love hate relationship for me. EWS does grow on you a bit with repeated viewings; still a lot of people will likely be turned off by the pacing. The film is still better than a lot of what's out there, and is definitely worth a look for fans of Kubrick's other work. Overall though, I felt it was one of his weaker efforts.",Eyes Wide Shut
506,Darryl-Gonzalez,Glorified pornography,1,26 May 2009,"This movie is porn dressed up as pseudo-intellectual nonsense. Avoid at all costs. There are much better ways to spend an evening than watching this awful piece of tripe. Sure, Tom Cruise's acting is OK, and Nicole Kidman is passable, but what can one say about a movie that features a semi-Satanic fertility ritual as its central scene, along with the death of a hooker in that scene? OK, one can make the argument that maybe he was fantasizing about sex, and so was she. Sorry, I have no need to spend any time watching someone else's fantasies. I only watched it originally because I was unaware of the content of the film, and because it was supposedly a Kubrick masterpiece. I was initially VERY surprised to see this piece of trash coming from the same mind that gave us ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", which is one of my all-time favorite films, but then I was reminded that the same mind gave us ""A Clockwork Orange"". Fitting end to a career indeed. He could have done SO much better.",Eyes Wide Shut
507,Daniel-10,Blame it on the gossips!,9,28 September 1999,"Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise in a Kubrick's movie? Well, everybody read and heard many things about it, but you know what KUBRICK means in a motion picture. When he was not perfect like he was in ""2001"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"", he was high above the average like in ""Lolita"" and ""The Shining"", for example. In addition, Kidman and Cruise are not only the most gorgeous couple of the movies but they are, indeed, very talented. Then Kubrick died, what meant that it was the last chance to see a new production with his name. Mix these facts with all the gossip that came before the movie itself and so here it is: the most awaited movie of the year, along with Star Wars, maybe.These facts are well known, but you have to recall them cause it explains why some of the Kubrick's fans got a little disappointed with ""Eyes Wide Shut"". It's not a fine situation cause, usually, you don't know where the emotions of the related facts end and where starts the impact of the movie itself. Besides, you will never get surprised cause you expect nothing less than the best.Well, the movie is a genius' work, no doubt about it. In the beginning, you may feel a little strangeness: Kidman and Cruise seem a little dislocated. Wouldn't they bear the responsibility of being in a Kubrick's movie? No way. When the scene of Kidman's confession gets, this problem is already gone and then the rhythm starts to flow in Kubrick's way. It's a delightful experience.Moreover, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not in the same level as ""2001"", but what kind of movie would be? Now, when you compare it to the other movies that were released lately, it stands alone in the top. Isn't it what a Kubrick production is all about?",Eyes Wide Shut

509,LynneSin,What a disappointment,1,25 July 1999,"What a disappointment!!  Anyone who rated this movie higher than a 5 probably did so cause they liked all the nudity.  But let me tell you, this movie was just down right horrible.  And I love Stanley Kubrick films! Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket are both in my top 20 of favorite films.  This is probably in the bottom 5 and I can't believe I sat through all 2 3/4 hours of this movie.  As I left the theatre, it turns out I was not the only one who felt extremely disappointment by this movie.  Everyone was complaining about this movie (for those who actually stuck out the entire film, there were several walk outs too).Where did the movie go wrong?  Well, first he cast Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise as the couple.  Let's face it, Nicole and Tom are incredible actors on their own.  (Kidman - To Die For, Portrait of a Lady, Dead Calm and Cruise - Rain Main, Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men just to name a few).  But the other 2 films that Cruise/Kidman starred together in (Days of Thunder and Far & Away) they just have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever.  This movie just proved it one more time.  If either of them is to ever win an Oscar, they should stop starring in movies together.  Second, personally I do think that Kidman is the better of the 2 actors and yet she was practically delegated to a supporting role.  She is a strong actress and deserves a much better role than what this movie had to offer her.  Did she have to be drunk during the dance scene?  All this talk of the sex between her and Cruise was nothing compared to her porn-star romp with the Navy officer.  Nicole, you deserve a much better part than what this movie offered.  Tell your husband you love him and go find a movie script and a co-star that will help earn you an Oscar.And Cruise, first, what's this with Doctor's flashing their badges everywhere they go?  He was just not believable as a doctor?  That whole badge thing was like ""Hey, I'm a doctor here's my badge, now can you do something to help me get this plot out of a rut?""Finally, just a few other things that bugged me.  Was it necessary that the prositute have to have HIV?  I realize that safe sex and HIV/AIDS awareness is an important topic, but it added nothing to this movie.  I was slightly offended at the 13 year-old prostitute, just felt it wasn't necessary and quite disturbing.  And yes, what's the big deal about having to block out the orgy scene?  I mean, we saw the sex, we saw total frontal nudity.  And let's face it, this movie should be NC-17 rated.  No parents in their right mind would let their kids go see this movie.  Then again, no parents in their right mind should go see this movie.This movie is a sad finale for Stanley Kubrick.  He's had a marvoulous film history with some of the most memorable, visual, thought-provoking movies of our time.  It's a shame this had to be his last hurrah.  If you've never seen any of Kubrick's other films, please rent them so you can appreciate the fact that he was a brililant director.Well, that's my say.  Oh, and get ride of that horrible music in the movie too.  That was the most treacherous sound to my ears.",Eyes Wide Shut
510,MetroRev,"A deep, beautiful movie. Classic Kubrick.",8,6 August 1999,"WARNING:  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN EYES WIDE SHUTI'll start off by saying that ""Eyes Wide Shut""(EWS) is a Stanely Kubrick movie.  If you have not seen one of his films before do not start with this one as it is a very strange movie as compared to today's short attention span theater.  Now that I have cleared that I can begin. 
Where do you begin to talk about a movie that includes necrophilia, sex cults and orgies, prostitution, pedophilia and infidelity?  I guess what I want to do is spoil the surprise and  say that there is no infidelity. 
The most interesting thing about Kubrick's final film is through all the hoopla over the sex people missed the fact that the story revolves around two people who care for each other. Alice admitting to Bill that she has sexual fantasies, not involving him, was a blow to his ego(As it would be to most men).  He gets called away and gets involved in several sexual encounters.  A lot of which parallel some of Alice's fantasies. He never strays from Alice and in the end, when he does go back to the prostitute, he gets ""slapped"" with with a helping dose of reality.  Totally blown back by the fact that she is a victim of HIV.  The movie is masked (as the people at the sex cult) in this ""big sex  flick"" stereotype and that in itself is a joke by Kubrick.  Nearly everyone went to see a ""sex flick"" and came out bewildered because it was not.  It teases you(purposely) with taboos but the truth behind it is the relationship between Bill and Alice and a deep look into Bill's sense of his marriage and how that is rearranged and at the same time strengthened.  Kubrick is a master film maker but unfortunately, like a Picasso or a Poe his work is greatly misunderstood, even worse today where people are making Will Smith a millionaire because he can spew cheesy one liners in front of digital bugs all the mean time while some one decides that the faster the cut and the more funky angles you have the ""cooler"" the movie is.  One amazing thing about Kubrick which today's people often talk about is that Kubrick is one of the few artists(Listening Lucas) that actually ""kept it real,"" never straying from his vision and his own sense of style.  In this modern era, where movies borrowed styles from MTv videos (Progress?) I welcome EWS with open arms.",Eyes Wide Shut
511,WhiteyEd,Kubrick scores big in his final work.,10,18 September 1999,"Stanley Kubrick's final work was very thought provoking, brilliant, shocking at points, and all in all, a very enjoyable film.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" got so much negative publicity in America because it was too sexually explicit. The fact that it has been edited for content made me extremely upset.  The worst part of that was the company that made the movie waited until after Kubrick died to make all the changes.  The same critics who said that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" shouldn't be viewed are also the ones who said that ""Full Metal Jacket"" should.  The whole issue of sexuality versus violence has made me physically ill.  The MPAA has no problem with graphic voilence, but nudity is horrid to them.I enjoyed ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  When I went to see it, I honestly didn't know what to think.  I had heard how it was leading to the downfall of America's youth or something because of all the nudity and sex.  You know what?  The sex was done in a tasteful way.  When I was sitting in the theater watching ""Eyes Wide Shut"" I was simply amazed at how this movie was not the erotic soft-core porn movie that it was supposed to be.  There were not even that many arousing scenes to me.  This is coming from an 18 year old male.Stanley Kubrick's final movie should be seen.  It was a well done portrait of people in love and how they react in certain situations.  I gave it 10 out of 10.",Eyes Wide Shut

Anyway: it's a lot better than his last movie before this one,  and in my opinion his worst, Full Metal Jacket. The film shows that it's a great loss that there will never be another Kubrick again.",Eyes Wide Shut
513,leviathinin,"""I don't know why I love this picture....but I do!""",10,7 February 2001,"I truly believe upon watching this film, that the people who have criticised it were disappointed because like in most Kubrick films there is a moral, albeit a hidden and twisted moral in his cinematic masteries. I think the wonder of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is that there is no hidden meaning, no metaphor and there is certainly no moralistic hint. It is there to simply stun and to be seen as Bizarre (to an extent it does this) but for some reason, the atmosphere and a lot of the dialogue just pulled me into it's deep and disturbing void. There is no over-acting, no big speeches, no shouting, and no overly-flamboyant violence. It is like a steamboat on a river moving at a slow pace, and almost suceeds in glamourising the illicit sexual misdemeanours occuring in society.

515,KristinNAz,Requires multiple viewings to get the full impact of Stanley Kubrick,7,5 March 2005,"When I saw this film for the very first time, I will admit that I did not like it,,but I couldn't think of the exact reason why. I thought it was very slow in some parts (mainly when Tom and Nicole are in their bedroom getting stoned and having an argument, that part just dragged on and on), and the movie scared me a little bit. After HBO kept airing Eyes Wide Shut I found myself watching it over and over, and now I think this movie is a work of art and a masterpiece. You really have to have an appreciation for Stanley Kubrick to appreciate this film.The movie is supposed to be set in NYC,, but one of its biggest flaws was , it was apparent it was filmed in another city (London to be exact). Tom Cruise plays a physician, Bill Hartford. His wife, Nicole Kidman, admits she often fantasizes about sex with another man,, and then he starts to question his true desires and feels he should get back at his wife for her fantasies. It's almost like this movie sends a subtle message- don't cheat or even think of cheating or ""they"" will get you! This is all proved by a series of strange coincidences throughout the film, including the prostitute that Dr. Hartford attempts to hook up with. Sydney Pollack has a role in this film as a friend of Bill Hartford, seemingly normal, but then he too is involved in orgy-like escapades that involves people wearing masks,, another part of the film I thought was creepy.The music played during the orgy scenes, believe it or not, is hauntingly beautiful. There is a lot of speculation as to whether Dr. Hartford is dreaming the entire time the film takes place. I honestly do not know and this never occurred to me the many times I've seen this film. Also, I couldn't figure out the purpose of the scene involving the ""Rainbow Fashions"" shop owner,, who apparently allows his underage daughter to seduce older men. I guess Mr. Kubrick is just telling us that the world is full of perverted sickos. I think, overall, this is a fine film but you have to be open minded about it.",Eyes Wide Shut

523,Malcs,Kubrick's Last Laugh,10,22 March 2000,"There was a brilliant article in the magazine Brill's Content a few months after ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was released which explained what happened to the marketing of the film before it was released. What it boils down to is the fact that Kubrick only let one person see the film before it was released and that person worked for Time magazine and he saw it 72 hours before the film was scheduled to be released in July. But since film magazines and other avenues of the mainstream media have production cycles that have deadlines months in advance, before you knew it rumour was being compounded on top of rumour until it completely snowballed out of control. Obviously no member of the press actually went to the trouble to actually read the novel that Kubrick based the film on, they were more interested in repeating whatever rumour sounded like it would sell magazines. At one point I remember hearing that the film was about two psychoanalysts who are married to each other and each of them starts to have an affair with their respective patients and then they decide to swing with them. Whoa. Says a lot more about the person who thought up the rumour than it does about the film itself. Of course, Kubrick played it to the hilt by just refusing to comment and letting the rumours get out of control until you have lapdog rags plastering their cover with things like ""The sexiest film ever?"" Can you say ""Pavlov""?The public really was conned into thinking that this film was going to have THE most erotically charged orgy ever filmed by what is considered one of the, if not THE, greatest director of all time. So you wonder why everyone said it bombed? Because they were swindled into thinking that it was supposed to be like the rumours and when it was finally released it was revealed to be just like any other Kubrick film: I.E. a sensitive and very analytical piece that is essentially an art house film that will be discussed for decades. No wonder Kubrick kept his mouth shut: he got his last film, an art house film with, as such, a very limited audience, into the minds of everyone passing a news stand and got them into the theatre thanks to their blind faith in the lies and rumours that the mainstream media publish before they realized that it was, sure, a movie about sex, but not an erotic movie at all. Kubrick made a film which analyzes the difference between sex and love (something the United States doesn't realize there's a difference between) and shows both sex and love in ways that are not erotic at all. Those who were disappointed by this film were those expecting a movie with sex in it to be erotic, which basically reveals just how shallow this culture is. It's actually the warmest film Kubrick ever made. If you can think about sex without getting aroused, you'll love this film. If you can't think about sex without getting aroused, perhaps you're better off with Russ Meyers films.",Eyes Wide Shut
524,RonB-4,"Not for the casual movie fan, but serious fans will love it",10,18 July 1999,"At last, after 12 years of waiting, Stanley Kubrick's new film is in theaters. Alas, it's also Kubrick's final movie... The great one died in March shortly after finishing work on ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star in a dreamy, surreal exploration of human sexuality, love and jealousy. Like all Kubrick films, ""EWS"" will only be understood and truly appreciated after repeated viewings, but I offer here a few first impressions. This is a gorgeous movie, full of intense primary colors, lovely natural lighting and the wonderful tracking shots Kubrick has made famous. The performances by Kidman and Cruise are both exceptional, but the supporting cast is possibly even more impressive. Those looking for titillation won't find it here; instead, this is a serious study of the intense emotions that lurk just below the surface in most if not all marriages. The story begins with our sexy couple going to a party, where they get separated and both engage in some serious flirtation, but nothing more. Later, back at home, they discuss the evening in one of the movies strongest scenes. Perhaps to make Cruise jealous, Kidman tells her husband about a man she has been fantasizing about for months, a Naval officer she saw only in passing, but who she says she would have given up everything for if he had only asked her to. Before Cruise can react to Kidman's riveting speech, he's called out on business (he's a doctor,) launching him into a night of bizarre sexual and romantic encounters that play like a feverish nightmare. It culminates with a bizarre masked orgy at which Dr. Bill is deemed to be an interloper and is threatened with death if he reveals what he has seen. Back at home, Kidman tells him about a sexual dream she has had in his absence, and as the rest of the movie unfolds, we begin to wonder what is real and what is a dream. I won't reveal more of the plot, but will say the movie ends on a hopeful, romantic note, something Kubrick fans have seldom seen before. Some critics say the ending is a sell-out, but I kind of liked it. The final word spoken before the ""Directed By"" credit is, it seems to me, a fitting epitaph for Kubrick, the most cerebral yet sensual director America has yet produced. A note for casual movie fans: this is not for you. Audiences used to the pace of sitcoms and ""Armageddon""-type films will not be able to sit still for this 2-and-a-half hour meditation on the human condition. People behind me in the opening-night packed house bitched and moaned throughout about the pace, that nothing ever happened, etc. What's more, they laughed at totally inappropriate places. Obviously meant to see ""Big Daddy"" instead.",Eyes Wide Shut
525,Tyson1,It is a piece of art! Excellent cinema!,10,19 October 1999,"Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) are a married couple with a young daughter.  One night Alice gets high and tells Bill of a sexual fantasy she had with a Naval Officer.  Bill is then set off on a sexual odyssey of adventure and curiosity.  It's a magical journey into the mind and adventures of of man determined to do something about his wife's revelations.  The many different moods and emotions through out the picture is played and is crafted brilliantly!  It also deals with a mysterious masked ball where Bill is almost killed but is saved (redeemed) by a mysterious woman who later in film turns up dead.  This thriller is absolutely extraordinary and the whole two 3/4 hours of the film is entertaining, textural, surprisingly refreshing, and simply perfect.  The great director's last and his best film before he died on March 7th, only days after seeing his final cut of the film for the first time.  It is extremely haunting.Everyone has a different view on the film.  That was partially mine. I've read the screenplay, I've read the novel Dream Story, I have the soundtrack.  I plan to really analyze and study the film more when I own it on DVD.  I've even corrected reviews of the internet made by some pretty popular critics but have their information wrong on the film.  I think it might be too strong right now, but in time Eyes Wide Shut will be called a piece of art, a masterpiece, and  by everyone.Eyes Wide Shut**** (out of four)",Eyes Wide Shut

I'm kind of glad Kubrick didn't have to see the reviews for this movie....it is sad to see an icon flop.  The whole idea of the movie, that a well educated contemporary man would have some kind of breakdown when he discovered that his wife had a sexual fantasy about another man is ludicrous.  Kidman's (over)acting in her ""stoned"" scene was like a scene from ""Reefer Madness"".  I expected to see a sophisticated erotic film that delved into sexual obsession.  What I saw was a movie from a director who seemed to have a silly, old fashioned hooded cloak fetish.

The slow following of Tom Cruise throughout the movie (rather than keeping the camera stationary) is a wonderful technique that submerses the viewer into his character.  The colors are fantastic.  The angles extraordinarily complex and dramatically moving.  As for what the movie's about?  I don't know, for sure.  I think I know, but I don't think anyone knows for sure what this movie means.  I don't think even Stanley Kubrick knew when he made it.

There are some things to hate about this movie (that damned awful piano score) but also things to admire about it. If you feel this is Kubrick's worst movie, try sitting through Barry Lyndon. If Stanley was still alive I'd like to ask him what was up with Alan Cumming's character, was it supposed to be funny or just disturbing? I thought he was going to leap over the desk and kiss Cruise.Overall, this film was a little suspenseful and NOT SEXY AT ALL. And the ending of the story with Kidman's promise to Cruise almost came off more like a threat. Or a life sentence. Whatever grandpa Stanley says, sex is not THAT scary.

With Stanley Kubricks final film, Eyes Wide Shut, he weaves an intricate tale of lies, deceit, envy, paranoia and sexuality. Eyes Wide Shut is undoubtedly Kubricks darkest and most confronting film not because it's subject matter is exploited, but the fact that such common sexual urges and tendencies can be led to morbid outcomes of the highest caliper, in addition to that Eyes Wide Shut can also be perceived as a pretext to Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's ambiguous marital relations.

I won't give a plot summary, as so many people have and the plot itself is fairly simple to follow. Cruise is amazing at the height of his career (his Oscar-nominated performance in Magnolia followed) and Kidman is captivating in her monologue early in the film, the revelation which sets in motion the strange and eerie events of the film. Kubrick's talent is once again visible, employing classical music as well as an unsettling piano tune which plays during the second half (by Gyorgy Ligeti) to sink us in, as well as a mysterious plot which pulls us without warning into a dark world of sexual discovery. Cruise plays his frustrated doctor character with ease and skill, one of the best performances by an actor in a leading role in 1999.

As I stated before this is an excellent film that I recommend to watch by yourself ( DO NOT watch it with your partner). It really made me think.

I don't understand why people hail him as one of the best directors ever. I'll never know. He certainly knew how to make good films, I just don't think he practiced it all that much. Plus, I'm always being told how he was a stickler for details and would shot entire scenes if something went wrong, but I CONSTANTLY find shadowing and crew reflections in his ""masterpieces.

Here's what I don't love or like:  Eyes Wide Shut.  What a stinker.  Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't completely awful or shoddily put together.  It was just far too long, and ultimately misguided.  What starts out as a semi-surreal exploration of sex, the subconscious, and the merging of these things degenerates (after the infamous orgy scene) into a dull, plodding, unsuspenseful thriller that peters out rather than builidng tension.  The final explanatory scene with Sidney Pollack deflates what little mystery there might be left.  It is a dreadfully generic way for such a pioneer as Kubrick to end what started out as a promising film.  Tom Cruise is decent in the lead role, but unfortunately, Nicole Kidman is wooden.  At least when she has her clothes on and is talking.  Kubrick's visual style is as breathtaking as ever, especially during the costuemed orgy and whenever he lovingly frames Kidman's perfect body, but the script is bad, and some points downright laughable.  Too bad this is the last taste of Kubrick we'll ever have.",Eyes Wide Shut

I think a movie about jealousy and the politics of sex in marriage is a superb idea, but in order for it to work we need to care about the characters, they need to be well developed. They are nothing but mannequins here. And there's almost nothing believable here, from Cruise flashing his medical license everywhere (how many MDs carry their license card? and is there even such a thing that fits neatly into your wallet) to his getting so wound up over Nicole's THINKING about cheating on him. And I agree with all of the posts on the hypocrisy of the nudity: WHY do we only see nude women??? I know the director is a man, but please, have SOME compassion for the female viewers. And seeing Cruise shirtless isn't enough, for me anyway, since I don't think he's very good looking.",Eyes Wide Shut
535,Hamlet23,Amazing. Absolutely amazing.,10,21 July 1999,"This movie may well be Stanley Kubrick's best.  Like his other movies -- maybe even more so -- this one is a diamond, and Kubrick wore the jeweler's glass. Every facet, every detail seems to have been considered and carefully calculated.  The colors and the sets -- both of which are incredible -- stand out in this regard.  Each one means something and expresses it.  The score is the same way -- to me, it surpasses even the Psycho score in its contribution to the more frightening moments of the movie.  Towards the end of the film -- at the climax, in fact, when I should have been used to it -- I jumped at those piano shrieks.  Twice.  When this movie decided to be scary, it was the most scary and disturbing movie I have ever seen. The sex in this movie -- though I think it is a study of sex -- is of secondary note.  This is not a porno, and the sex in it is not steamy or sexual.  Most of it is downright eerie. If this movie does not win at least two Oscars -- Best Picture and Best Director (neither of which a Kubrick film has ever won, much to my astonishment) -- I will never pay attention to the academy again, because this will be final proof that it has no taste.  Also, I have learned two things about the censoring of this picture: (1) Kubrick realized that he would have to add the digital characters to get an R rating, and planned to do so.  Though they were added after he died, it was according to his wishes, and (2) I didn't even notice the digitally added characters. They affected the movie or the scene in no way at all.  Though the MPAA are Puritannical Retards, and I am disappointed that I live in the only country in the world that made him add these things, even the MPAA could not damage Kubrick's work.  Besides, I am sure that an NC-17 version will at least come out on video, and that will settle that. This final film -- most aptly described by Janet Maslin as ""haunting"" -- gets an 11 from me.  Kubrick was entirely in a class by himself.  The film is forever diminished by his loss, but at least he left us with a collection of movies to watch in awe forever.  Eyes Wide Shut is definitely a worthy addition to this collection.  Thank you, Stanley.",Eyes Wide Shut

537,pierfconsa,An enormous phallus ... but founded in unstable sand,10,1 July 2001,"I am probably the last person who should write anything about this movie. I am a profound deep admiror of Schnitzler, and am very fond of Austrian decadentism. I was so amazed, happy, thrilled to find out at the end of the movie that the story was actually taken from Schnitzler, a writer whom I have always admired. The decadence of The Male is very well conveyed in this movie. I hope I am not forcing the interpretation, but I thought that Tom Cruise was very well chosen as his role is certainly that of a pathetic loser. Cruise's character is a sort of Ulysses restlessly traveling through the most trivial masculine sexual depravations.  It is in the nature of things that most of the public didn't like the movie. It became so famous thanks to Kubrik's name and that of Cruise and Nicole Kidman. However, it's not typical Hollywood movie, and it's difficult to like it without some background. Personally it was a great experience, and I didn't have to put any effort to let myself navigate into the dreamy atmosphere. The part of the masuquerade was superbous. The musics, the masks, a perfect Freudian nightmare. Also, there is no room for women in the movie. They are represetned simply as the object of male's desires and aspirations. Nothing is dedicated to the explanation of their own world. It's a film all in the masculine gender, but extremely autocritical. I loved to watch the movie, I felt I was looking in a mirror, or sitting at a psychanalist who choses nice words to explain your own pathetic selfconscious",Eyes Wide Shut
538,ben_andreas91,"A film that depicts sex, sexuality and frustration.",9,30 August 2008,"Eyes Wide shut is a very interesting film. The film hasn't got any big plots, but has a lot of long, gentle scenes which have a very obvious theme; sex and sexuality. The film evolves around a couple who have been married for over 8 years. They have a luxurious house and a young daughter. They seem to have it all, until early in the film Alice (Nicole Kidman) opens up to her husband, Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) about how she feels about sexual lust and how it's affecting their relationship. After an unbelievable unreal truth from his wife, he leaves their apartment. And in this night of pondering and confusion, he encounters parts of the town filled with sexual culture, frustration and desperation. As he experiences, he learns frightening truths along the way.As mentioned, the film hasn't got a direct plot, but it shows different parts of human sexuality and sexual relationships. It kind of throws it in your face sometimes, because it barely gives you a break. Either you can think of this as very interesting or very exhausting as you might get the ""I get the point"" in your head. I for myself am not sure what I make of this, but I really learnt and understood different aspects for different types of sexual topics (Such as; homosexuality, prostitution, pedophilia and fantasies) It also asks the question of how important sex is in a relationship and how many people might confuse the two. Other than that, I felt that the character studies of Dr. Harford were very captivating. It kind of answered some of my other questions, which was how a person with high intelligence and full of love can still not fully understand the other part of the relationship which lacks spark and excitement.All in all a film worth seeing with a message and theme which is more than ever relevant in the world we live in today.",Eyes Wide Shut
539,chris-impens,Better written but less consistent than the novella,8,11 November 2011,"A film you're not likely to forget. Kubrick's slow ""Barry Lyndon"" pace works nicely, the plot is intriguing enough, acting and score are excellent. The film is much better written than the original novella -""Dream Story"" by Arthur Schnitzler-, which is very poor literature indeed. Actually, the novella is more like a draft of a novel yet to be written than anything else. Fortunately, it has been written, if not by Schnitzler. Kubrick also threw in some drugs, several homosexual aspects and two new characters: Victor Ziegler and Mandy. Not all of these additions are improvements. The stoned couple does reveal some secret thoughts, but the gay elements don't add anything, quite the contrary. In the novella, the street incident has nothing to do with gay bashing but with death in duel, which fits nicely between the deceased patient and driving to the orgy in a hearse. Mandy also doesn't add anything except her nice body and some extra confusion. She ends up in the morgue, and Victor claims she was the ""mysterious woman"", but he's definitely lying. If you watch closely enough (it's a hard job, but someone has to do it), you see their bodies are different; if you're lazy, just verify the credits, and you'll find that, in real life, one is called Julienne Davis and the other Abigail Good. Are we expected to overlook this, or is it an extra ""dreamlike"" layer deliberately added by Kubrick? The nice thing for an author or a director dealing in ""dreams"" is that logical inconsistencies are part of the game! This said, the novella, while poorly written, is less inconsistent than the movie. Schnitzler's intruder is betrayed at the orgy because he's the only one not to change costumes, and -speaking of costumes- the shop owner's daughter is caught wearing a whig and sitting with two gentlemen dressed as judges. I fail to see why Kubrick had to turn these into Japanese. (Incidentally, Marion Nathanson's fiancé, a historian according to Schnitzler, is a mathematician in the film. As neither detail has any importance, one wonders why such changes are made at all.) Most importantly, Schnitzler's password for the orgy is directly linked to the woman's infidelity fantasy; it's a pity that Kubrick threw away this crucial entrance key to the man's fantasy. The novella ends with the mask on the pillow. If only Kubrick had done the same! His last scene, trivial and cheap, is a complete letdown.",Eyes Wide Shut

Maybe even the actors couldn't find a way to make the writing more interesting so, even their acting came off badly.There is absolutely no chemistry between anyone. The ""orgy"" scenes are laughable and couldn't be any less sexy if they tried. Even the sex scenes are boring! Some people said it was filmed beautifully. Where? Harsh, yet kind of gauzy. It just seemed to be both glaring at you and out of focus at the same time.This is not a masterpiece. Oh, it wants to be. And it tries to be so provocative, smart and forward thinking. Instead, it comes of as an old fashion 70s porn film - and not even as sexy as one of those! It was ridiculous. I did sit through the whole thing when it first came out. I kept expecting it to get better, I guess. And I tried to watch it again recently. It's even worse now. It has not aged well.One to skip unless you are just curious.

541,Maximus975,Summary,7,19 October 2008,"Stanley Kubrick is regarded as one of the greatest directors of his time and even past. Making only a few films in his career, which spanned four decades, ended with the mystery drama thriller ""Eyes Wide Shut."" The films length spans a little over two and a half hours, and within it is the modern day classic Kubrick masterpiece. The look of it is very ""Kubrick"" because of how it was shot. Not simply just the lighting, but also the film stock as well. As a special request to Eastman- Kodak films, the company remade and released the film stock that had been out of print that had that look Kubrick desired. Lit mostly with practical's, such as Christmas string lights and assorted lamps around the room  Aided only by the occasional china lantern or highly diffused light. The story itself revolves around Dr. Bill Harford (played by Tom Cruise) and his encounter with a cult of sex fiends. Even though the movie possibly could have easily been told in less amount of time, it is very unlike Stanley Kubrick to not show every detail both prior and post the main event of the film. To get a greater sense of whom Dr. Bill Harford and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) we spend the greater portion of an hour and a half learning about what kind of people they are. What sort of fantasies, and lives they live on the outside of their marriage. Not to take any of this lightly, it was not uncommon for Kubrick to spend much more time than any other director would have on a scene  making sure he captured every little last detail, and that he got what he came there to get. Such a scene takes place between Bill and a friend of his Victor Ziegler (played by Sydney Pollack). Taken in one location, that of Victor's billiards room took roughly a month to film. Any other director would have been told to move on by studio heads because it was a waste of budget. Sadly however only a few days after the movie was shown to the studios Kubrick passed away.",Eyes Wide Shut

It absorbed my total attention, it guided me along this journey to which I didn't know where it would lead, it isn't a straightforward story. Kubrick takes us through this film in a way I feel I have never experienced before with any film. So fluently and smart and you are never sure of where it is going or what it is you're watching. It's really about what goes on in the mind, not everything can be taken literally, it may be a dream or not, but you don't know which part is which. You're constantly being challenged as to your beliefs and values. The story, the images and the music captivate unlike anything ever has in film.

There are subplots that have nothing to do with anything in the story. The costume store story has no purpose. Cruise goes to rent a costume from a costume store, the owner of the store sees his underaged daughter having sex with two older men so he traps them in the store and continues doing business, threatening to call the cops. When Cruise returns the next day he sees the Johns leaving the store, thanking the owner, who tells Cruise that they worked it out financially before offering his (still underage) daughter's services to Cruise.The music is beyond irritating - a single piano note being hit over and over.So this is a 3 star film.

1999
When I saw the film back in the day it left me baffled as it did with most viewers (and many critics as well, though they had a hard time trying not to show it).
The death of its author overshadowed the film, and rumours about the famous ""masked orgy scene"" somehow mined my viewing ""..when's this orgy scene coming...?""
So I was left thinking that this cryptic farewell by Stanley was either too complex for me or that this story about jealousy didn't turn out to be as iconic as his other masterpieces.2019
20 years have gone by and I now believe that EWS is one of K's most complex and fascinating films.
Maybe because I've grown up in the meanwhile but on my second viewing I picked up on details, patterns, hints, symbolisms that I didn't ' on my first viewing twenty years ago. This is a film to watch over and over again.The plot a in a nutshell: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are the Hartfords a dream couple,young, beautiful and presumably with good economic prospects..but as wealth and status they are nowhere near to Victor Ziegler (Sidney Pollack) whose grand style Christmas party they've been invited to.
At the party the couple toys with the idea of possible infidelity (without believing to much in it) and Cruise's character, who is a doctor, witnesses also an unexpected aspect of Ziegler's private life though he is sworn to secrecy.The following day after having had a fight with his wife on the subject of infidelity Cruise's character is called to the house of a patient and this sets him off on an all night long journey across a Christmas lit New York.
He is tormented by jealousy but at the same time he bumps into many potential sexual encounters with different women (most of them, if not all with rufous hues in their hair like his wife's).
The night culminates in an out of town castle which in a distorted way (as in a dream) provides a bookend to Ziegler's party at the beginning.
By the end of the eventful night all of Hartford's insecurities, inadequacies and maybe his inability to climb the social ladder are dramatically unfolded.Throughout Cruise/Hartford's odyssey his perception of sex is always associated with money and death and violence and guilt and social status.
But maybe Nicole Kidman's character has a more practical take on this subject. Her last line in the Christmas shopping scene maybe is after all the best way to drive away nightmares and insecurities, restore normality and reunite the family.This F-word is the last thing we will see from Stanley Kubrick, a very private man whom we got to know a bit better in the following years through books and documentaries and interviews with his family and collaborators.

With all the media hype over the film and the filmmaker, I was interested to see how the film would stand up to all the wild rumours and expectations. Instead of getting a wild porno flick, Kubrick brought as a classy, slick story of two bored people who imagine life on the wild side but see how scary the scene is and bails out.

549,tobiasn,"ill-conceived, pretentious, and Tom Cruise is miscast",2,2 July 2002,"Kubrick grew up in the Bronx, NY. It is possible that in junior high school some other boy told Stanley a fantasy about orgies on Long Island, NY (where richer people lived). Perhaps as an older man - after a liftime in England - Kubrick retained such a memory, and glued onto it another idea he had - to cast a real-life couple as a couple in a movie.There is hardly another explanation how such a great film-maker could make such a piece of incoherent nonsense. While Tom Cruise is an under-rated performer, his specialty is aggressive, high-energy, and relaxed characters. To cast Cruise as a repressed older NY physician lacking in imagination was colossally wrong. In 30 seconds anyone can think of a better choice (John Heard, or Jeff Goldblum spring to mind).Kubrick's earlier movies were marked by the realistic and detailed depictions of technology and professions. Compare this movie, which completely fails to depict what is like to be a doctor.Of course, if Kubrick had wanted to make a real movie, in order to introduce conflict he would have had his doctor discover the practice of sleeping around with female nurses, or something. But no, it had to be a secret society of orgiers! Given the name of the movie, is this society supposed to have opened this doctor's eyes? That's so absurd an idea as to be almost laughable.I am no prude, I like looking at women as much as the next guy, but here some strange almost-lechery seemed to have compelled Kubrick to put sequence after sequence of female half-nudity, all of it gratuitous and dull. Maybe it was Kubrick's film-maker instincts, maybe he knew that showing so much flesh would con all the young fools into thinking this was a good movie.",Eyes Wide Shut
550,V Hanna,Temptation Comes To Us All!!!,9,21 July 1999,"Kubrick has delivered again and as fate would have it for the last time. I was very anxious to see Eyes Wide Shut but at the same time I knew I had to be patient when the movie began. All of Kubrick's movies require you to watch patiently until the credits roll for you to truly get a feel for what you have just witnessed. Eyes Wide Shut falls right in line with this style. The light he uses is very similar to what Scorsese used in many of the scenes in Casino. This gave the film a visual painting of characters and added so much life and emotion to scenes that would have been empty without it. The films drips of the subtle daring side of sex. You can also feel a real sense of a foreplay effect that the movie emotes to the audience. Almost every scene involving sex in some way felt like Kubrick was tempting the audience slowly and deliberately with a hint of danger and then yanking it away. Watching Cruise go through this ritual of sticking his hand close to the fire and pulling it away was done to perfection. Kidman's role was less than I expected but she did a grand job of pushing Cruise to seek pleasure because of jealousy, but at what cost? Famous orgy scene was hypnotic, dark, mid evil and very dreamlike. Why not just go for the NC-17 is the question everybody keeps asking. What normal parent is going to bring their kid to see this movie? I would have rather seen it in its purist form but it didn't make as much of a difference as I felt was present with the two versions of Basic Instinct (You know what is going on behind the digital characters!). Two things to remember. Approach with a patient attitude, this isn't Rambo you're going to see. Last thing watch out for the ending it comes real quick and if you blink you might miss the last line which is perfect. Rest in peace Stanley and thanks for great movies that will go on forever!!",Eyes Wide Shut
551,hermes-10,Kubrick scores another hit,8,9 September 1999,"After reading the rather bad reviews, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. Photography, editing and direction are top. The subject matter - adultery - is relevant to most people. Two things I found strange: the overwhelming majority of people present at the ""orgy"" were just standing silently and watching. Why not participate if you are at an orgy, after all? The other thing I found weird was the end: Tom Cruise asking Nicole: ""What do we do now?"", as if god knows what had happened. In fact neither he nor his wife had done anything, just fantisized a bit. Nothing to be dramatic about. But apart from that, it's a great movie. A shame to have lost that director.",Eyes Wide Shut
552,Lloyd-23,A very unusually bad film.,1,30 September 1999,"By writing this, I am hoping that I will save people a lot of time and money.  Last night I went with a friend to see Eyes Wide Shut, Stanley Kubrick's final masterpiece.  Supposedly, he had wanted to make this film for twenty-seven years, and spent sixty-seven weeks shooting it, an incredible amount of time for a commercial film.  Being the sort of mug film buff that I am, I thought that I should go to see a film made by an acknowledged master, who had  spent so much time getting it just right.When the film finally ground to a halt, the audience in the cinema stood up and as one started muttering things like ""Is that it?"",  ""Thank goodness that's over"" ""Well, you can see why there are only two showings per day"", ""What a pile of ****"".  I have never heard a cinema audience respond so negatively to a film before.  We talked about it, and we had not a single kind word to say about it.  I have thought about it since, and find it void of redeeming features.It is badly photographed. The sets are often unconvincing. The acting is mediocre. The continuity is poor. The lighting is awful. The picture quality is poor.  It looks as though it was shot on 16mm, and the prints were made at Boots. Hardly anything happens which is believable. There are gaping holes in the plot. Worse than all the above, it is  incredibly  slow.  At no point does the pace quicken.  It is wildly too long. Every single conversation happens at a snail's pace.  Almost every conversation is punctuated by very long awkward pauses.  It seems as though Stanley thought about every scene so much in isolation, that each scene took on great significance, and to get the importance of what was happening across, he dwelt on every word and action.  Every scene could be halved in length and lose nothing and gain much.I was expecting a film in which Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise play roughly equally large parts.  The film is almost entirely about the Tom Cruise character.  I was expecting an intelligent exploration of jealousy and relationships and the like.  Instead we get half way to a thriller, but not all the way, not enough to make it interesting, and there is no intelligent comment on human nature, nor, so far as I can tell, on anything.This film takes itself so amazingly seriously, and yet is transparently ludicrous from start to finish.  Human beings don't behave like that. Nothing made sense.  Characters kept acting on information which they didn't have.  The various parts of the world were not using the same clock.  The sun kept rising and falling at odd times, and characters would go back to somewhere they'd been the day before, to find that no one there had moved, changed clothes, or even finished what they were saying.Yes, there is a bit of nudity in it, but this is presented in scenes of such unnecessary length, and such little incident, that you just wish they'd get on with the next scene.Having more recently spoken to several other people who saw it, I have encountered near-uniform condemnation of this shamefully bad film.  One person fell asleep during it several times.  One had to apologise to the five people who went with her to see it, who all hated it (it had been her idea to go to see it).  Only two people reportedly enjoyed it, but they enjoyed it solely because they thought that it was so bad that it was funny. I say that it is too dull and slow to be found entertaining that way.I would thoroughly recommend this film to people I intensely dislike.",Eyes Wide Shut
553,qflw,Did not live up to its acclaim.,1,24 April 2000,"It wasn't even particularly erotic, despite all the nudity.  Made its point rather heavy-handedly and didn't give much enjoyment.

I tried watching this movie on video, it took me 5 sittings to get through it, my eyes kept shutting... 
At times it is a beautiful film to look at, but not often enough.  I haven't been this bored with a movie that had nudity in it since 'Showgirls'.   
If this movie was made by anyone but Kubrick, it would have been panned, laughed at and forgotten before it hot the theaters. But because it was Kubrick, and it was also his last, no critic wanted to say anything bad about it.   Being a Kubrick film, it brought to mind a Kubrick classic, 'A Clockwork Orange'. Not because they were similar movies, but because I would have needed the Lodovico technique to get through it in one viewing.",Eyes Wide Shut

The movie was a slow drawn out and indulgent mind game. Scenes moved at a crawl many time giving too much time for the mind to wander. A friend of mine fell asleep, another kept asking, ""What's going on? What's going on? and another watch mildly amused especially since he came in during the swinging club scene. I felt that that particular scene was served with a certain foreboding fanfare. Bill wanders into a secret society and becomes driven by curiosity and acts more alive there than other parts of the film. He and Alice are zombie parents and I found the family scenes comedic in its coldness. Laughing in the gaps between scenes kept me going to the end. I wish I was entertained by Eyes Wide Shut as others who had raved it. Unfortunately, this one is not for me. I was glad when it finally ended.",Eyes Wide Shut

Clever social statement by Kubrik, but boring to hear. Exquisite cinematography and beautiful set designsPerhaps this is a movie for the innocent and inexperienced.

559,vdecaire,One of the most audacious filmmakers of our time delivers an unforgettable modern sexual fable,8,12 April 2008,"The story begins with a shot of what the film is entailing: sexual deprivation, temptation and exploration on so many levels. The shot is of Nicole Kidman slipping off her dress revealing her naked body within the pallor of her luxurious apartment. Funny. Tom Cruise plays a different role for him, but not one he necessarily did poorly with, in fact, playing someone in his position would be quite a task. After the couple- William and Alice Harford- enjoy themselves at a party hosted by a fellow doctor, they adjourn to their home to have sex. Ahem. Anyway, they drink, and smoke pot, and begin telling each other how hard it basically is to ignore the temptation of everyday sexual situations, which brings up a story that a menacing Alice begins to tell, about how she almost cheated on him, almost. But this seems to spark some kind of chain reaction for Mr. Harford, and he leaves on a house call, but out of spite, revenge and malice decides to walk the streets of New York, and begins a quest of moral and immoral discovery that leads him to long periods of thought to himself. What is just a story of light revenge between a husband and wife, is actually beginning to become a harrowing journey into some kind of murder mystery. After his pianist friend (Todd Field) informs him of a new gig he got at a mysterious location, Harford can't ignore the apparent lustful edict that goes on at this place, so he gets a costume, including the infamous mask, and spends a lot of money, then is ready to go to this place. It was described as sexual pleasure beyond imagining. And he realizes that it is, but it is also some kind of dangerous cult that poses a threat,and when a stripper informs him that he does not belong there and must leave, he also is told the same by the group. So he leaves with strange confusion. I must not go on. Needless to say, this is a great final film for Kubrick, with two great performances from the leads, and a script based on Traumnovelle by Arthur Schnitzler.",Eyes Wide Shut
560,jamalhugo,The work of a God of Film,10,14 November 2009,"I have to say, this movie is extremely artistic, and uses quite a lot of symbolism, in expressing a message. The music played, throughout the movie, made it seem like a dream, you were in a trance the whole time. Stanley Kubrick, died a week, after it had finished being created, he was a genius, and one of a kind. It will take some time to understand the film. Stanley Kubrick, made the film, lead you in a certain direction, he made you think, what he wanted you to think, he had everything planned. This movie, is also, extremely psychological, because you constantly have to think what is happening, and think about the characters, and what they are thinking. A noticeable element in the film, is that there is a lot of suspense, which just makes it that more amazing. The whole movie, was planned, there is not a moment, metaphorically speaking, that you walked, or stepped away from the path that was built. The movie can be watched over, and over again.

In the party, they both confront other couples and cheating.This starts a sequence of events that teaches inexperienced Bill the many sides of sex while his more mature wife stays at home and tends their daughter.The counterpoint between a prostitute and underground sex party is quite huge. But essentially both show the mysticism and rituals over the same theme. They both are essentially cheating or exploring what is naturally ours.Tension. I have felt it through the movie. Maybe because the topics are quite sensitive. Taboo. Unknown.Whose fault is it? In the movie we see both man and woman make mistakes and make up mistakes. The underage girl with the men, the secret party, all over the movie.The movie gets little by little more psychological and spooky even. It's wonderful how we get the whole spectrum of sex from innocent flirting to HIV and death since sex represents life.The buildup towards the end is immense. Nothing like I've experienced ever before. Maybe the guilt of Bill makes him make things more serious as they really are. And also what his wife experienced was probably not as serious as he thought.

566,Reinbo-7,Best movie of the 90's,9,2 September 1999,Kubrick definitly is the master and this is his last trick. In the dawn of the digital area he shows us that with an 16 mm camera (the film looks so grainy it could have been shot on 16 mm) and a piano and a couple of good actors one can make a film that is much more profound and impressive as all multi million dollar action extravaganza.,Eyes Wide Shut
567,jon-88,the emperor has no clothes....,1,3 September 1999,"Found the movie to be a total failure - really one of the worst movies I've ever seen, for the following reasons:   1. Basic acting and mechanical problems - the writing was laughably bad, and the actors were directed to be wooden - they took five beats between every line, and were almost devoid of emotion (you have to assume, given Kubrick's habit of doing a hundred takes, that he *chose* these wooden performances as being what he wanted... Tom Cruise has too large a body of work to assume that what is on the screen is representative of what he would normally do). 
As to the writing: there was this motif of answering almost every question with a repeat of the question, after a few beats, until finally this friend of mine was able to say this sentence after a line by Cruise to Kidman: ""If she answers by repeating his entire question in the form of a declarative sentence one more time, I'll kill myself..."" whereupon that is exactly what happened.  in another scene, Cruise walks into a room, featuring an obvious shot of a small Christmas tree. I say aloud ""nice tree""... after which Cruise's character says ""nice tree...""....  I mean, farcically bad, like how many times did Cruise's character show his wallet ID card and say ""I'm a doctor"" to how many people?  2. Structural problems  so, the basic conceit is that the wife's dreams are dead-on realistic, while the husband's reality is dream-like... wonderful. But by the time you clue in to this, you just don't care, since nothing that actually happens makes any sense. So, of course, you can say it's *supposed* to not make sense, since it's ""ream-lie"", but that doesn't really help, since it is, actually, reality.  why would the people at the orgy care so much if someone crashes their party? they're all in masks! who the hell would know who was there?  why would the costume-store owner go from wanting to kill his daughter for being a slut, to offering her to Cruise's character?  why would anything that happened, happen? why would Kidman's character report those dreams to Cruise, in such a brutal, nasty, straightforward way - and then why would she cry after Cruise's character told her what happened, since nothing actually happened? He wasn't unfaithful with any of these prostitutes or other women he met. 
3. the music - unbelievably annoying  4. the scene around the pool table - neither character knew what they were saying, or why they were saying it - nothing that happened made any sense, on any layer that the movie was trying to work on.  5. the mask on the bed - I *wish* there was some hiding of emotion, or layer of deceit, but both of these people told each other everything, to the detriment of their relationship.

It's ham-handed, outdated, ridiculous, absurdly sluggish and the blame for the terrible performances rests squarely on Kubrick's perfectionist shoulders. Kidman was terrific in ""To Die For"" - I'm not a fan of Van Sant, but at least he knows how to work with people. I think Kubrick was too old and out of his element to make this movie. It was a bold step for him, I think, and I give him credit for trying. I'm just disappointed that it failed and wish that ""A.I."" could've been his swan song instead of this.I think this film, edited down to the half-hour of solid material that's actually there, will make a great after-school special in 2030.

570,ecto-3,"Reality, phantasy, and desires become mixed together in this rich tapestry",10,18 July 1999,"When a couple have been married for nine years, as the ones portrayed by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in Stanley Kubrick's final film, one supposes that they know all the intimate details of each others lives. But such is not the case in this engrossing study of a marriage.Kubrick weaves a tapestry that is rich in symbolism, set on the margins of reality, and lushly filmed in a New York City which looks slightly alien, erotic and mysterious. In fact, the events of the script leave a wide margin of doubt as to where reality ends and one's dream fantasy life begins.With a deliberate, slow pace, the audience and the players are constantly teased, led down false paths, confused, all in an effort to strip away the layers and layers of protection that we all construct in our relationships and in our lives, literally the very masks with which we present ourselves to the outside world, and even in our most intimate liaisons.Reminding me of earlier works by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, including ""Persona"" and ""Wild Strawberries"", the psychological novels and social commentaries of Henry James and Edith Warton, the film has Kubrick's unique imprint composed of endless details, lushly lighted sets that look like Rembrandt or Vermeer paintings, and dark street scenes evoking menace and mystery, and not unlike scenes from ""Blade Runner"" or even the cult classic ""Around Midnight"".The women that fascinate Cruise's character in the film are all variations of his cinematic and real-life wife, Nicole Kidman, in eroticism, hair color and other body features. In one screening, it is very difficult to recall all the nuances and revelations of meaning. Like some other Kubrick masterpieces, including ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""2001"", and ""Full Metal Jacket"" each viewing should unlock new layers of truths. I give Eyes Wide Shut very high marks for serious cinema fare, though many might enjoy it just for its stunning look and beautiful actors.",Eyes Wide Shut

There the defining questions are always : How so? To What? To Whom? It is well known, among scholars, that Nietzsche said : ""I believe that I have guessed some secrets of the highest man's soul. Perhaps everyone who guesses them is destroyed."" (Trnsl., Thomas Mann; 1947.) Kubrick's so refined adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's Freudian/Nietzschean novel of fin-de-siècle decadence, at this climactic turn-of-the-century and outset of a new millennium, takes the form of his culminating masterpiece of cinematic art and sophistication. And is, in a word : Great !His filmed tribute to and like celebration of all the deep-psychological Mystery in the human condition, reconstructs anew and actualizes those earliest discoveries which motivated very passionate collaborative exchanges between the psychiatrist and the novelist. Indeed we may well contend that our extremely talented director was once again ""ahead of his time"" with this last film and his own breathtaking exploration of the dream-like reality of the human Soul !Such examples of the ""dangerous"" variety ARE perhaps that which is why ""we have Art"" at all; that is, ""to keep us from perishing from (mere) truth !

572,MrJerry,Disappointing farewell for Stanley Kubrick-a movie that was overpromoted,6,17 October 2001,"Stanley Kubrick was a director who was said to have made a number of masterpieces among his movies.I don't consider ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to beamong them.Although Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman(who is nicely photographed in this movie,although some of the shots of her become tiresome after a while)were still married in real life when this movie was made, they appear to lack passion together in this movie.When I first found out about this movie,I went to see it in the movies and walked out part of the way through because I found itto be too slow and not interesting.I saw it on video,however,and although it seemed slightly less slow on tape than it did inthe theater,it is still a disappointing movie,I think,for severalother reasons.1) It is a movie that could have been a half hour shorter and been more effective. 2) The plot is not all that strong;Cruise's sexual odyssey is not an overly big deal in that more doesn't happen with himthan does,although he is on that odyssey in reaction to what his wife DIDN'T do with the sailor.Also,the last third of themovie rings flat,especially with the scenes where the mask that Cruise wore at the orgy is in bed next to Kidman and whereCruise met with Sydney Pollack at the end(which was a weak ""wrap up"" scene,so to speak.) 3) Although the women looked fairly good and there was a lot of nudity and sex in this movie,it WAS NOT a movie that was erotic,in my opinion.I think that the promotion for this movie was in OVERKILL mode over how erotic this movie was going to be.It was a cold movie and not anything that would be that exciting,so to speak.The orgy scene was more weird than anything that would be a turn on,not to mention that the music is overbearing. 4) Finally,the ending was one of those scenes that could be described as a case of ""What?"".That was a weak ending to a movie that is on the ridiculous side and seems to have run out of steam before the end.In short,this was not a terrible movie,but not the greatest of endings for Kubrick's career and a disappointing movie for both Cruise and Kidman,although they both can act very well and have done so in their movies.I give this movie a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.One final comment on ""Eyes Wide Shut"",DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! well.The story was not there for them this time.",Eyes Wide Shut
573,addict123,Kubrick's final masterpiece,10,3 February 2009,"You've gotta hand it to Kubrick, the man never sold out, no matter how critically acclaimed his films were and no matter how much attention the film industry has paid to him, the man always worked to achieve perfection in every shot of every minute of every film he made in his forty years or so in the business. Eyes wide shut, his last feature, is a prime example of Kubrick's masterful directorial style, though not as critically acclaimed as other films he made such as 2001, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut deserves to be included among these, just showing that right up until the end, Kubrick was still making some of the greatest films ever. Kubrick's direction is unquestionable, everything about this film is pure class, perfect shots, perfect locations, perfect story, and a perfect cast. I was sceptical about Tom Cruise at first, for reasons other than the obvious that according to the IMDb review submission is a prohibited word, but Cruise gives a great performance here, it is a shame he went on to be in such limp efforts as Valkyrie. Having the patience to work with Kubrick does make me respect Cruise more than I did, as it is common knowledge that Kubrick demanded up to 100 takes in some of his picture, explaining why he only released a catalogue of around 15 films over a forty year period. But Cruise's performance here is definitely the high point of his career, especially so in scenes where he has no dialogue, such as the orgy scene. Cruise wandering around the mansion observing depraved sexual acts while the piano instrumentals help add to the mysterious aura. As well as being the high point of Tom Cruise's career, the orgy scene I would say definitely rivals other famous moments in Kubrick's history in film, the camera moving through the house, its just encaptivating. On top of Cruise's performance, all others cast in this film were clearly the only people you could cast in the film, perfect actors on perfect form, all roles were played magnificently, Kidman especially. I was unsure about her performance in the scene about half an hour in where Cruise and Kidman's characters were getting stoned together and arguing, but only to slight extent, throughout the film Kidman's role as Alice, the wife with sexual longings makes the plot all the more interesting, what with Cruise's character Bill's investigation into the orgy. Another noticeable aspect of the film that adds to its impact is the score, the piano based instrumentals serves to add to the tension and the mysterious atmosphere, especially so during the orgy scene. The instrumentals make the film feel dreamlike, its almost as if the viewer is seeing it as though they were stoned. The instrumentals help to suck you into the world of the confused jealous husband, adding to the film's overall impact on the viewer. The film was controversial at the time of release, but let me just say that if you think that sex and nudity detract from the artistic significance of a film, you're a f******g cretin. Some argue that porn is art, and the sex scenes and especially the orgy in Eyes Wide Shut proves this right. The orgy scene may be pretty daring, but that was the brilliance of Kubrick, there are no boundaries, all he cared about was making an amazing film. It really is a shame that Kubrick's gone from the world of cinema. While so many nowadays pander to the hordes of those who wish to see more limp, badly directed tripe such as the alien vs predator films or god forbid movie parodies like disaster movie and s**t like that. With people like Kubrick gone, we've got very few visionaries left. We've still got Lynch, the Coen Brothers, Cronenberg and others, but more and more people flock to features with no heart in them. While Kubrick's gone, his films remain a testament to his extraordinary directorial style. Eyes Wide shut is a prime example of the director at his best.",Eyes Wide Shut
574,ColtSeavers,We're awake now,10,1 October 2006,"I saw this movie a couple of times, and each time I was more impressed by how carefully it is construed. With this movie, Kubrick once again lived up to his reputation of being a perfectionist. But the reason why I love this movie so much is not its amazing technical finesse, but its content: We as humans are not in control of our sexual desires, nor are we made for monogamy. Temptation is everywhere. Thus, even a ""straight A-marriage"" like the Harford's can never be the whole truth. When Mrs. Harford, under the influence of Marihuana, confesses her fantasy of adultery to her husband, their naive illusion of perfect harmony is shattered, never to be restored. Instead, Bill goes on a journey into his own (and more importantly, OUR) hidden wishes and imaginations, and is increasingly overwhelmed by the power of sexuality (it doesn't matter if all this really happens or is just a dream of his). In the end, there's desperation, a confession, and tears, but at least: ""We are awake now"". The Harfords have matured by accepting an inconvenient truth about what it means to be human. And there's the stunning realization, that there can STILL be love. Maybe not forever (""let's not use that word - it frightens me""), but at least for the moment. And so, after all, there's one thing the two of them are going to do as soon as possible...What an insightful, liberating and important movie !",Eyes Wide Shut

576,The Galaxy,Kubrick's All Time Masterpiece,10,19 July 2001,"SPOILERS                SPOILERSEyes Wide Shut is Stanley Kubrick's all time best it is brilliant and unforgettable and it's a piece of film history. Some people have sad that this movie was boring, and that it does have a point but, it does have a point it tells a story of two peoples lives in jealously of each other's sexual fantasies and journeys. In the movie Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) is Married to Alice (Nicole Kidman) in real life when this was filmed they were married, In the film they acted like a real life married couple has well because it is not always perfect with jealously on there mind all the time it is true to most married couples. The films first scene of jealously is when Alice gets stoned on pot she tells Bill that when on vacation she had sex with a navel officer. Bill is then shocked and is quiet, the phone then rings, he leaves the apartment. That is just the start of Bill sexual journey of revenge for what is wife did.          SPOILERS                         SPOILERSThe Mask Ball. The scene of the Mask Ball was some of Stanley Kubrick's best filming ever he made art without being so pornographic movies like Spike Lee's Summer of Sam. So read this if you want to know how a piece of film history was directed. Their is a scene were Bill goes to estate outside New York. He gets the password to go into the estate from his friend Nick Nightingale he had previously seen him that the Sonata Cafe that is where he got the password from him. Bill than goes to the estate with the password, he than gives the password ""Fidelio"" to two men outside the house, he than enters the house. ""The Mask Ball"" when he enters the house he sees what looks like some kind of sexual ritual that is taking place in front of several onlookers. Bill is than approached by a women that warns him to leave he does not. Bill than goes through several rooms where sex acts are taking place in front of several onlookers those acts can't actually be seen but in the unedited orgy scene which I have seen you can see them. Bill was warned that he did not belong their and the people find out and warn him that if he says thing about what he saw some thing bad would happen. At the Mask Ball they said one of my favorite quotes in the movie and that is ""But I warn you...if you make any further inquiries...or if you say a single word to anyone...about what you have seen...there will be the most dire consequences for you...and your family."" What I like about this scene is that Stanley Kubrick did not just put sex he made it into art like that sexual ritual, The mask ball, and the fact that only some people where allowed in with the password ""Fidelio"" it was not some open house sex party if you were thinking that.Stanley Kubrick made sex and nudity into art that is not the first time Kubrick has made some thing into art in 1971 he made violence into art with A Clockwork Orange. He is to me the greatest filmmaker of all time and proves that he is the best in this film that he directed Eyes Wide Shut.             By Carlos D. Montemayor",Eyes Wide Shut

579,seanwilson556,A mesmerizing psychological thriller and Kubrick's most underrated film,10,24 November 2009,"Sadly, Stanley Kubrick died before the commercial release of his most underrated film. Eyes Wide Shut is a surrealistic mystery tale, a creepy thriller full of amazing scenes and rich colours.Tom Cruise gives a great performance (almost unrecognizable) as Dr. Bill Harford. Cruise has incredible acting chops and shows it all in this film. Fear, curiosity, anger and many more. Along with Cruise is Nicole Kidman as Alice, Bill's wife. Nicole shines in her scenes and especially in the scene with her confession.Despite being promoted as a steamy, erotic thriller with Cruise and Kidman ""getting it on"", it is not at all erotic. The infamous orgy scene, even though it has strong sex, is more mysterious and disturbing instead of erotic. And yes, this is a better thing.I think the reason it isn't as popular as it should be is because of the false advertising. Hopefully, this underrated masterpiece will be recognized in the future as it is a beautifully shot, creepy psychological thriller and a great end to a very great artist.",Eyes Wide Shut

I think they are made for dumb people. While i am watching the movie i feel so much bored and i thought that director thinks that watchers are going to love it when i make %60 of the movie like erotic film. Is it just easy that making watch the movie? I don't think so if i want to see an erotic movie i just buy it. But this movie is nothing more than an erotic film. Tom Cruise is a doctor who can attract every women in the world and he can pay money to everything like a millioner. There so many things i have to say but most of them have been said from other watchers who give this movie 1/10. Also nowadays Adverts are so like that movie. It shows people that everything is just like that in the world. I don't want to understand this movie and all other Kubrick's movie.

Every scene except for the masquerade is excruciatingly overlong, and talk, talk, talk. At least a half hour could easily be excised. Worst of all, there is no dramatic buildup - it drags the viewer to a head-scratching anticlimax that makes you want to scream, I sat there for well over two hours, and then it simply ends? As for the supposedly controversial sexuality, it feels more like you've been groped by a blue-gloved TSA agent. If you want to introduce a friend about why you're a Kubrickian, start off with Dr. Strangelove or A Clockwork Orange. EWS isn't even close to being entertaining, let alone provocative.

583,supahz,EWS Fails To Live Up To The Kubrick Legacy,1,17 July 1999,"I like Stanley Kubrick.  What director can boast of such a wide variety of films and styles while maintaining such a high level of work?  Few, and Kubrick was one of them.  The man was a filmmaking genius.  No one can argue that point.  However, we CAN argue the merits of individual films within a lifetime of work, and EWS would have to rank as a major disappointment when measured against Kubrick's past achievements.The film was beautiful visually.  Kubrick certainly had his own vision, as every good director does, and his fans certainly won't be disappointed from this perspective.  As far as the craft of making films goes, EWS was often fantastic.  However, the actual story drags in places, which isn't good for such a long film.  In fact it was so much so that I heard some of the 30 or so patrons in the theater begin to make comments to the screen about it. Some movies are meant to be interactive, with cheering and such, but when a film generates only ""get on with it!"" and lots of ""sheesh""es, it's not a good thing.Sydney Pollack was extremely solid in his role.  Nicole Kidman's rear end did a fine job.  And the whole scene of the orgy party was very well done. Another highlight was Alan Cumming, who provided a much-needed wake-up and comic relief as the hotel clerk.  But these were not enough to save the film.I suppose that we should all play nice and rave about EWS, seeing as the master filmmaker died just after its completion.  And I suppose that we should also go along with some fawning critics and claim this is a wonderful film, worthy of praise alongside truly amazing Kubrick films like 2001 and Dr Strangelove, because, after all, it's his last film.  We should, I suppose, also ignore  Nicole Kidman's weak performance (her pot smoking scene was laughable, and performance generally shallow), Tom Cruise's overwrought emotional performance (which was, barring the often senseless crying and whining, nicely done), a piano soundtrack that threatens to cause insanity, and a totally inadequate and weak end scene.  Why?  Well, it was Kubrick's last film, of course.Baloney.  The truth is, unless you're serious Kubrick fan, or a die-hard Kidman or Cruise fan, you're bound to be disappointed.  Like mystery?  It's here only as a misleading force.  Like romance?  Look elsewhere.  Want drama?  There's some, but it's fairly bland stuff.  EWS takes on many angles and delivers on precious few of them.  True, it's nice to have someone take a ""mature"" look at sex and relationships, and to do it intelligently and seriously.  Intelligent films are a good thing, when done right.  There are elements of genius in this film, but it simply doesn't come together in a way that relieves the boring stretches and overshadows the weak performances and ending.I can't imagine that this film is going to be a favorite among the general movie-going public.  I'm sure that that's just how die-hard Kubrick fans would want it, and that's great for them.  However, to fans like myself who have enjoyed Kubrick's work in the past, and had high expectations for this film, it's a disappointment.  Looking back now I can't understand the secrecy or hype around the movie.  And I'm guessing that neither will most movie fans.",Eyes Wide Shut
584,Dave-300,And Lead Us Not into Temptation,9,20 July 1999,"In a society that often refuses to acknowledge the conflict between good and evil in our world, EYES WIDE SHUT is a refreshing if not somewhat depressing expression of the conflict that resides in each of us.  I'll not summarize the plot, for it would not do justice to the allegory that Kubrick spins as he directs his protagonist toward the abyss of his soul.  I will note, however, that he does it magnificently.  The music is hauntingly beautiful; colors merge and reflect the dissonance of the conflict; the actors are most convincing as they wrestle with their humanity...with their eyes wide shut. 
Certainly, there are problems with the film.  Kubrick is often deliberately, yet, agonizingly slow.  As is the case with all allegory, there are moments of confusion regarding the development of the plot.  Nevertheless, after having had a few days to reflect on the film, I plan to see it again...with my eyes wide open.  It is one of the best films of the year.",Eyes Wide Shut
585,GrammarCub,"Haunting, brilliant requiem by one of the masters",9,16 July 1999,"I'm still in shock after seeing ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" a haunting masterpiece of a film written, directed, and produced by one of film's great artists, Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick died just five days after showing his film, suggested by Arthur Schnitzler's novel ""Traumnovelle,"" to Warner Bros. Thankfully, the studio has left most of Kubrick's vision intact, reportedly interfering with but a single scene. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is sexy, emotional, thrilling, and sickening - and brilliant. During the filming, which took over a year, the cast and crew were sworn to secrecy. Speculation and rumors ran wild about the husband-and-wife team of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman: would there be a steamy sex scene? Or, even more intriguing: would we see Tom naked? All anyone really knew was that this was a sexy thriller, a la ""Basic Instinct."" An early rumor I heard was that Kubrick decided to shoot a porno movie using well-known actors and a good script. Well, forget anything you may have heard before - you're in for a shock.Put simply, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not really about sex. Not that it isn't erotic - nearly every scene is alive with sexual energy - but there's a bigger game at stake than just the one played horizontally. This is a film about power, and the loss of power that comes with sexual situations. Tom Cruise, who plays Dr. Bill Harford, is disturbed when his wife Alice (played beautifully by Nicole Kidman) confesses having sexual thoughts about another man. Perhaps part revenge, part curiosity, he sets out on an odyssey to be unfaithful - but somehow, never succeeds. One is reminded of those characters in Greek mythology who were given the impossible tasks in Hades; one had to fill up a bucket with no bottom, and one had to constantly push a rock uphill that would always roll back down to the bottom. Dr. Harford is a man without power who nevertheless requires it - in most situations, his credentials give him power, but he discovers there are certain people he cannot impress simply by flashing his board card.One of these people is his wife - time and again, she takes the upper hand in their relationship. As Bill stumbles haplessly about New York, visions of Alice's infidelity flash through his mind. Much of his odyssey seems to stem from a ""This'll show her!"" mindset rather than the cool, rational façade he wants us to see. In fact, nearly all of Bill's actions seem impulsive - from his decision to visit a whore's bedroom to his chance meeting with an old friend at a piano bar to the drive to the infamous manor house where the film's climax occurs. Dr. Harford is unable to exude power here, in the company of an exclusive group of lechers and courtesans. He is seen instantly as an imposter, and the message is clear: Only the powerful need remain.The specifics of the plot are not nearly as important as the film's ultimate message. Suffice to say, there is intrigue, murder, sex, drugs, and suspicion enough to keep even the most jaded moviegoer interested and guessing until the final scene. And, in keeping with the rest of the film, Cruise's character is not allowed to emerge victorious in the final reel - it is Alice who ultimately shows her strength and power, not Bill. ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" as its title may imply, is full of ironies both large and small: the main character is an anti-hero, his every success doomed from the opening credits; a hooker has sociology textbooks on view in her apartment; a junkie and whore sacrifices herself to save another. What makes this movie so intriguing is that every scene, every moment captured on film, is so carefully constructed that we get the feeling we are standing just behind Bill, observing his tragic fall and even being drawn down with him.""Eyes Wide Shut"" is an outstanding film, one that will be surely recognized by the Academy Awards. I would be very surprised indeed if Kubrick were not nominated posthumously for Best Director. In addition, it is rare indeed for a major studio release starring big-name stars to be an art film - and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a work of art. Every light, every mask, every character - all come together in a stunning array of beauty, shock, and wisdom that makes me realize what a tragic loss Mr. Kubrick's death was. I've often said that Stanley Kubrick never made a bad film, and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is no exception. Disturbing, haunting, and shocking, it is also a beautiful, emotional, and masterful requiem by one of the great masters.",Eyes Wide Shut
586,ike-21,Eyes Barely Open,2,9 May 2000,"Stanley Kubrick is a brilliant director that has a unique style, a vision for details, and an eye for the obscure.  But I don't know where his artistic ability was for this film.  Knowing this was Kubrick's final film, I salivated for a great movie.  But this movie definitely does not deliver the goods.  Nor does it deliver a climatic finale.From the B-rated running of credits, and throughout the movie, I waited for the flavor that shocks the senses that Kubrick knows how to manipulate.  But that never happens.This movie lives on the coattail sympathies that it was Stanley Kubrick's last movie.  That's the only redeeming quality of this film.  In a morbid way, it felt as though Kubrick died before filming the end of the movie.Another irritating aspect of this movie was the soundtrack. The chanting at England's beautiful Highclere Castle was very long and annoying.  And I really would like to know if Kubrick had a cat pounce on a piano for his climatic scenes.  Seriously, I wouldn't put that passed him.On the brighter side, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were very convincing in their roles.  The scene where Nicole is telling Tom about her fantasy, almost made me feel that Kubrick confiscated one of their home movies.  Sure, the half-naked Nicole is basically what makes this scene tolerable for some people -- but next time, I'll save the money, open my window wide, and watch my Springer-like neighbors go at it!I give a 2 out of 10, just for the use of Christmas bulbs.

This film is about trust in a long term relationship.  As one newspaper reviewer put it, EWS is about that dangerous question between two people: What are you thinking?  This film attempts to answer that question. 
I've lived through some of the conversations in this film - and I know of others who have to.  EWS, while not a favorite film for me, certainly gave me food for thought.  If you don't want to know the answer to the questions then don't see this film.  And don't go to see it if you want erotic sex or a thriller plotline, 'cause this ain't that movie.  If you're willing to explore the depths of relationships, infidelity and trust, then this is the movie.",Eyes Wide Shut
588,dtaz,This is why he was Stanley Kubrick,8,16 July 1999,"I sat on pins and needles the last couple of days.  I was going to do something I hadn't done since 1987, go to the theatre and see the new Kubrick picture.  Ladies and gentlemen, I was not disappointed!!  I came away from this film feeling both exhilarated and like I needed a shower. Of course, that was the power of Stanley Kubrick's work, never to let you rest on one emotion.I hardly know where to begin in describing this film.  I won't give anything away, I promise.  I heard and read the adjective ""sexy"" a lot referring to this movie.  First of all, it is sexy, but I think we must clarify the term. This film is not sexy in the normal sense, but sexy in a desperate and, sometimes, dirty way.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a knock.  This movie shows us that sexy is not always defined by ""Playboy"" and romance.  Sex can be good, bad, or indifferent.  The physical act of love is, and always has been, second fiddle to the emotional.  The emotion is one of the things that makes sex good, bad, or indifferent.  The sex in this movie is shows that even love needs a helping hand once in awhile.  Sex can be about love, heat, secrecy, money, physical need, sport, business, casualness, and hate.  It can fill the voids in our hearts that we leave open in anticipation and it can fill the voids left as gaping wounds from injury.  Whatever it may mean to you at any given time, you must still make a choice.  You don't have to seek sex, it can find you; and when it does, you must make a decision.  Is your need great enough?  Is your wound deep enough?  What about the consequences?  Are all, or any, of these things real or imagined.  Are you awake or asleep?  How are you coming to these decisions; in your conscious or unconscious mind?There is a wise, old saying that applies to both men and women, but especially men:  Don't ask about her past because you DO NOT want to know. Cruise's character doesn't ask about his wife's past, she instead freely relates a fantasy.  This fantasy never occurred, and will never occur, according to her, but the more he thinks about it, the more it insinuates itself into his mind.  He is jealous, furiously jealous, of a fantasy. Why? Perhaps because the thought that your woman could find anything more appealing than you, even if only in her dreams, is a near-fatal blow the male ego.The production values are outstanding.  Every scene is rich in color and detail, especially reds, green, and blues.  This and the atmosphere outside lead you to connect with the emotions of the characters.  The score could not be more simple, or effective.  If those two adjectives don't seem to go together, close your eyes and replay the ""Jaws"" theme in your head.  The piano punctuates most of the non-dialogue scenes and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Therein lies the power of Kubrick's work.  Who could have ever thought that the subjects of sex and jealousy could be filmed and presented in such a way as to create a suspense thriller?  That is, without reducing itself to the violence of, say, ""Basic Instinct.""The movie is rather long (approx. 2 1/2 hrs.), but the story will pick you up and carry you along.  I was aware, during the movie, that I knew I had been in the theatre a long time, I was aware of the passage of time.  It didn't distract me, though.  I was pulled in and held tight.  That's the true test of suspense.  Like all Kubrick films, you have to pay attention. If this is not a selling point for you, then perhaps you should see something else.  If, however, you want something to wash the bad taste of ""Wild, Wild West"" out of your mouth and relish in something that challenges, as well as surprises you, then have a great time at ""Eyes Wide Shut""!!!!!",Eyes Wide Shut
589,concord-4,Pretends to be smart,2,17 July 1999,"Many people will rebut criticisms of this film by stating that it's a Kubrick movie and not meant to have the elements present in traditional Hollywood films with mass appeal.  The truth is, this film spends well over an hour building up to its premise, and when it finally gets there, the characters spout off cliche lines such as ""you know not what danger you are in here"".  And as I was watching the film ridiculously and boringly meander through its premise, I couldn't help but think, ""We are never going to find out what danger he is in, are we?""  I thought this because the film sets up a mystery with the potential to have a complex solution, yet it was evident from the laziness present in the writing up until that point, that it would be too much work for the screenplay's authors (one of whom was Kubrick) to formulate an intelligent solution to its own mystery.  This lack of explanation sometimes works in movies, i.e. not knowing what's in the suitcase in Pulp Fiction allows for fun speculation.  However, there is no such desire to speculate here, because as the film continues to sloppily drag on, the only thing you'll speculate on is when you'll finally get to leave the theater.",Eyes Wide Shut

The only difference is that since the video didn't have Kubrick's name in the credits, people would have laughed at Abdul's similar failure at sensuality, which was shot a decade ago.  Other ridiculous elements in this film include the irritating score which fails at creating suspense by constantly hitting one piano key; a hilarious recreation of New York City -- everyone has British accents and one street corner had three U.S. post boxes; and a child who's character seems to serve no purpose but to poorly act.",Eyes Wide Shut
591,Gary ES,Intense,8,29 July 1999,"Very intense, very disturbing, and very enjoyable.  Stanley Kubrick capitalized on an inherent weakness of humanity; fantasy.  I would venture to say that everyone has had some sort of fantasy and felt guilt afterwards. This movie explores this guilt, how people deal with it, and how it effects the ones you love.Fantastic acting by everyone involved, and incredible screenplay.  Spoken and unspoken words were real and intense, which prevented any dull moments from occurring during the 2 1/2 hours.  Kubrick should win an Oscar for best screenplay.8/10",Eyes Wide Shut

This movie had much of a comedy - but it was so bitter and dark that it wasnt really possible to laugh.This movie was about woman, who they really are. I guess woman did torturing him in his life - this is the only explanation why he made such a angry movie. Everything fits perfect - especially the title and the last sentence.So I try to explain what this movie means (SPOILERS AHEAD): Cruise is a man who loves his woman. He is the one who has his eyes shut, 'cause she betrayed him (only in her head, but this makes no difference). Now he starts searching for other woman - but every woman he meets seems to be a bitch (for instance the prostitutes). But then he found one girl, which gave her live to save him. Now of course he thinks that he found everything he searched for - and after that terrible event he searches for her. But as you know he found out that she only played a game. The people at the orgy only where man with money who wanted to have fun. She was a prostitute and played this role for money and betrayed him - again.So he tells everything to his wife - and the last thing she said to him was ""I guess we should fuck again"".

However I watched it on Christmas Eve and the action all takes place during advent. There are some jolly characters in red cloaks but no beards but they are taking part in a somewhat satanic prelude to an orgy and they soon drop the cloaks to reveal that is all they are wearing apart from the occasional thong.And the viewer/voyeur is sometimes invited to see the nudity through the eyes of a doctor  Dr Bill Harford  first the naked body of an unconscious woman whose life he saves and the naked body of an apparent suicide victim And for all the nudity, Bill Harford's sexual encounters are all unfulfilled. His initial encounter with Domino (a name which presages the ""fancy dress"" masked orgy he later attends  is interrupted by a telephone call from his wife (curse these mobile phones!) He himself turns down the offers of his deceased patient's daughter and a fancy dress shop owner who offers him his underage daughter ""for anything the doctor orders!"" And at the satanic fancy dress orgy he sneaks into, he is teased and then caught and sent off with a warning.There film is also a thriller in the more traditional Hitchcock sense of the term. There seem to be two murders but the good Doctor drops all his investigations and accepts the unlikely explanations of his rich client who turns out to have been behind one of the masks.

595,Fad King,A Tedious Swan-Song from a Legendary Director,6,13 May 2002,"This is in many ways an interesting look at jealousy and infidelity that is seriously marred by two elements: (1) excruciatingly slow pacing, and (2) building the movie around the famed centerpiece orgy scene, which may have seemed daring when Kubrick first started working on this screenplay in 1975, but today looks like a pretentious and very expensive scene from a soft-core cable flick. On the plus side, Kidman shines in what are essentially 3 dramatic monologues that occupy most of her time on screen. There's much to enjoy visually in terms of the use of color and light, and the haunting piano theme used during the orgy is an instant classic. Kubrick also manages to build some suspense, but by the time the mysteries were explained, my reaction was, ""That's it? That's what I waited 2 and a half hours to hear?""",Eyes Wide Shut

The movie is explicit, sometimes it's vulgar and repulsive, but every snippet of a dialog contains food for thought, non trivial, even controversial, but ideas, that from time to time will come to your mind and the movie will echo back even after a very long time.The plot is concentrated on a 9 year married couple which lives happy and peaceful life. But a confession, slight and insignificant at first sight, made by the wife (Kidman), turns upside down the lives of the both. A confession, that she cheated on him just by thought, makes the husband (Cruise) to open his eyes and see that he did not really know neither his wife, nor himself, and this revelation leads him to a chain of unusual and dangerous affairs.But the plot is not the only strong side of the movie. Flawless acting of Kidman and Cruise, supported by Kubrick's unique style and accompanied by brilliant music complete the picture.Even if you are not fond of Kubrick, or drama movies in general, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a must see, just to be aware of another type of movies, or maybe the only representative of that type.",Eyes Wide Shut

Instead of contributing his talents to better mankind during the day and enjoying his family on nights and weekends, he (and apparently his wife at some point) goes off on a wild goose chase to get into a very private sex club. Well, duh. Give me a break! So I guess (the film was very vague about everything) if you have the right password you get to have weird sex with whomever. What would they have done to Dr. Harford if he had not known/guessed the right password---made him replace one of the bimbos and answer the door in his birthday suit? Would he have had to grown a mustache (and smiled sideways) too?If this was 1960, and if I was an 8th grade boy, and if I had sneaked into this movie with my cousin (or found the DVD while my parents were out) maybe I'd snicker and think this flick was hot.

I've been interested in Stanley Kubrick's movies but after 2001 A Space Odyssey I figured he'll never come close to anything like that again and he didn't until this movie. It's said that it was his last but at least he had the last word about true cinema and not money making garbage for human consumption. Eyes Wide Shut first gave me the idea of what the Bohemian Club was about but it's more secretive then that and less open to the public. It's for very rich and powerful people who don't have a clue what evil they are a part of and how much it destroys. They are the button pushers and puppet masters of the age of politician and dictator greed that we live in. Anything evil is possible with eyes wide shut. The suspense is comparable to 2001 but not from a computer and actually HAL seems more human than some of the faceless characters in this movie.

But now Eyes Wide Shut is being rediscovered as a cult and already there are a host of blogs and articles online talking about how great the film is.

A chance revelation by his wife sends Dr Bill (Cruise) on a journey into the sexual underworld of Manhattan that is as disconcerting as Marlowe's trip up the river to find Kurtz.

604,PurityofEssence100,Great effort wasted on bad story,4,18 July 1999,"Stanley Kubrick once said of making a good film, ""if you have good actors and a good story it almost doesn't matter how you put the thing together."" In case you ever wanted to know what kind of film you might get if you happen to have good actors and a bad story we now have an answer.  It's called Eyes Wide Shut.More than any other director Kubrick was always able to sniff out a great story.  Often the stories he chose to make became emblems for an entire a generation: witness such works as 2001, Dr Strangelove, or a Clockwork Orange.  One can only wonder then what on Earth was he thinking when he decided to make this film.  For the story premise of Eyes Wide Shut is singularly awful.The movie revolves around the psychological and emotional tailspin Tom Cruise's character is thrown into when his wife (Nicole Kidman) confesses a sexual fantasy she once had for a sailor.  A fantasy, I might add, she never acted upon.  It is the imagined picture of his wife being humped by an unknown sailor that is, if you'll pardon the pun, the driving narrative force, propelling Cruise, as a New York doctor, on a journey to lift the lid on the many dimensions of his own repressed sexual desires - necrophilia, and so on.Now to start with, what's absolutely unconvincing is this film's very premise - that his wife's confession could throw Tom into such turmoil.  I'm sorry I just don't buy it.  And each time the film cuts again, and again to the black and white image of the Kidman/sailor imagined humpfest the more unconvincing the premise gets.  Then, what's even worse is the sexual/psychological journey Tom end ups actually traveling - from heart of gold prostitute, to nutty costume shop owner, to masked orgy.  It's simultaneously so trite and so bizarre as to be laughable.  Which is really too bad because much of the rest of the film is pretty good.  I mean, Kubrick certainly knows how to make a movie.  Technically the film is a pleasure to watch.  The camera movements, the sets, the lighting, even the acting is marvelous.   And some scenes in and of themselves are great.  There's a wonderful bit between Cruise and a gay hotel clerk.  And another one between Cruise and a grieving woman which borders on David Lynch.  As the woman sits next to her father's corpse, and Cruise tries to comfort her, she suddenly confess her love (and lust) and begins to shove her tongue down Tom's throat.  It's all really quite funny.There is some good stuff here.  It's just too bad it's all held together by such a miserable and unconvincing premise.",Eyes Wide Shut

The grainy film stock that Kubrick used was intentional, as if to have the audience view the film as if just waking from a dream.Also, there are many hidden goodies that Kubrick has placed in almost every scene for fans to keep an eye wide open to try and spot.Thank you Stanley for making one more powerful film for us to ponder, debate and enjoy.",Eyes Wide Shut

The music I thought was fantastic throughout, even the annoying keynote stuff because the director was not afraid to fully incorporate music into the film. The lighting was very good as well, I especially like the ""christmas tree in each house"" shot. This was pure cinema but if this film was done by any other director it would be called art house. I found with all of Kubrick's film is the lack of pace and action but what was said was interesting and maybe true. I felt there was a lack of characters but the actors there gave great performances, Cruise, Kidman etc. but I especially like the suit-hire man and the piano player.

608,ziggy-24,The stuff dreams are made of,10,22 September 1999,"'Eyes Wide Shut' could be the best translation of 'Traumnovelle': one should have one's eyes shut to be able to dream. Kubrick gives his own version of cinema being the art-form of dreams, thus the unconscious. True, this middle-class couple is very common and so are their sexual fantasies. This perhaps explains the disappointment of many spectators. In a way, EWS is the opposite to 'A Clockwork Orange' where the hero was forced to keep his eyes wide open in order to watch movies. And true enough, his fantasies were not very common or civilized as the Harford's. The home movie Dr. Harford sees, when his eyes are shut, is always the same: a black and white clip of his wife making it with a stranger. The worse is, of course, that the episode never happened in 'real life'. Perhaps is she only taking her revenge because she saw her husband with a couple of beautiful girls.He then discovers his wife is a complete stranger, a menacing presence, threatening his quiet existence. And suddenly, his life becomes a nightmare. Girls are HIV positive, or they OD, a father sells his own daughter to strangers, a pianist friend is murdered, he finds himself in the middle of a satanic orgy and, as in a nightmare (where you are naked among dressed strangers) he has to take off his mask. It's not important to know if the film is a nightmare or not. EWS shows the very stuff dreams are made of, which is to say, the very core of films as an art-form. EWS is truly a masterpiece. A very mature reflection on the moving image and its relation to our deepest emotions. The photography is absolutely brilliant: its grainy texture conveys 'life', as it would be experienced under the influence of a psychedelic drug. The technique, as always, is inventive without showing off its total command.",Eyes Wide Shut

Well Eyes Wide Shut proved beyond a doubt he can make a bad movie. I tried very hard to keep and open mind throughout this movie, I was just waiting on that ""moment"" when all the boredom I had endured would finally pay off. It didnt happen *sigh* Oh and to top it off the ""1940's Frankenstein music"" made it even more unbearable.

They should've saved their money & pooled it for a DVD of Titanic, instead of tittering to each other throughout the movie. EWS is a film that will be mis-understood by many of the patrons who flock to see it because of the media frenzy surrounding the fact that it revolves around human sexuality as a plot element. But it is NOT an erotic movie, despite the titillating aspect of frequent nudity. You soon get used to the nudity (intentionally, I think) and hopefully get over it so you can begin to digest the REAL story - that emotional and physical aspects of the human psyche are so intertwined with our ""normal"" daily-life-selves, they are inseparable, volatile; and affect us in ways we don't think about often, until a situation comes about that brings the issue to the forefront. And the real story in this film is presented & handled masterfully by the ensemble, under the absolute GENIUS of Mr. Kubrick. This certainly should've earned him that elusive ""Best Director"" Oscar; but thanks to the improper type-casting (of genre, ""near pornographic""??!?) the media has pronounced upon this film, that seems unlikely. Still, it is an obvious effort of genius, which successfully penetrates some issues that have been untouched in film previously. WELL DONE, Mr. K and Mr. & Mrs. Cruise!!!",Eyes Wide Shut

613,harmony-8,This film is definitely not a masterpiece.,5,20 July 1999,"I was very disappointed in Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, -- perhaps because I was a great admirer of Kubrick's films such as 2001: Space Odyssey and Dr. Strangelove.  The symbolism in the film was too obvious to be thought-provoking, and Kubrick's attitude toward the material was puerile and  puritanical at the same time, generating a sense of cognitive dissonance.  As the initial shot of the film as well as the deployment of the movie-star couple  indicates, the director at first seems to underline the voyeurism of the film medium, audience as well as of himself.  Well, however, as the film progresses, his critical stance toward the film medium disintegrates into his somewhat childish fascination  with the ""beauty"" of the nude female bodies in the Hollywood film industry(all of which reminded me of the naked mannequin beverage dispensers in A Clockwork Orange), which is nevertheless hidden under the facade of a stern moralist.  It is a sexist film, indeed.  (Well, which of Kubrick's films were not sexist?) However, the most disturbing aspect of this film event (what else can you call it?) to me was many critics' response toward this film: some of them even called this minor incomplete film as a masterpiece.  Their awe of this outstanding film-maker obviously pulled a blind over their eyes.  Eyes wide shut can be described as the condition of these critics whose inferiority complex makes them intellectual coward of themselves.  As a recent, more thought-provoking film hinted at, we are in a matrix-like system that has been created and controlled by the media. These unthinking critics are the ample evidence of this false-reality-creating machine.",Eyes Wide Shut

617,sharif68,"After Hours, Kubrick Style.",10,30 July 2001,"Stanley Kubrick's last film ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a film that is filled with beauty, danger, and ambiguity. The title of this film should have titled ""Fear and Desire"" because these are the two basic emotions that dominate this superb work of art.WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT! Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise play Alice and Bill Harford, an affluent Manhattan couple. He's a doctor and she's an unemployed art curator. They have a young daughter and everything seems to be perfect, until one night during an argument while they're both stoned on pot (Alice more than Bill) Alice reveals a sexual fantasy about a Naval officer that she saw while she and Bill were on a vacation in Cape Cod. Of course, this revelation shocks Bill, and makes him jealous (the image of Alice making love with the Officer fills Bill's head). It is then where the fun really begins where Bill goes on a strange and comic journey (similar to the Scorsese film ""After Hours"") wandering the streets of Manhattan where the daughter of a dead patient of Bill's (who wants to have sex with Bill in front of her dead father), a prostitute, some drunk College kids, and the very young daughter of a costume shop all come on to him sexually. Bill's journey takes a more bizzare turn when ends up at a mansion in the countryside (He takes a cab to get there which is film's most humorous moment) where an orgy is taking place. From there is where it gets dangerous for Bill and possibly his family because of his journey and the things he has witnessed.
While watching ""Eyes Wide Shut"", the writings of Kafka came to. Bill is an Kafka-like character because like Kafka characters, he's filled with anxiety and torment in an atmosphere of fantasies, dreams, and unsettling realities. But ultimately this film is really about chances missed and opportunities avoided presented in the form of an erotic daydream that is enhanced by the film's stunning visuals. Kubrick and cinematographer Larry Smith do an outstanding job playing with grain, bright lights (backlighting, underlighting), and strong primary colors giving the film an odd, erotic and melancholy tone.The performances are solid, particularly that of Nicole Kidman who really bares her soul( and her body in the film's opulent first image)in the revelation that rocks her husbands world. We really believe her as a wife who feels she's been taken for granted and possibly jealous of husband's success as a doctor. Her last line in this film is filled with irony (and totally Kubrickian) that is a fitting resolution for a couple going through some problems.Although, this film has been dismissed by most people now, it will stand the test of time and be hailed as a masterpiece like every other Kubrick film. But for now, my eyes (and head) are wide open enough to see that it's masterpiece and will continue to see it that way.",Eyes Wide Shut

This movie, however, is not for everyone.The movie is incredibly slow-paced, but if you see the film, you understand why. The first half of the film is incredibly Kubrick in its introduction of the characters. Tom Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford, a role which he is to be remembered for. Nicole Kidman plays his lovely wife very well also. If you can stick with the film and appreciate the art of it for the first half, the second half will blow your mind. Without giving to much away, I'll just say it contains the usual Kubrick eerieness, maybe even stepped up a notch.Besides the wonderful plot and acting, make sure to pay attention to Stanley Kubrick's use of brilliant colors and fabulous lighting.

622,Nearstars,An great original crafting from Kubrick,8,16 November 2003,"Many say this film was a big disappointment. Sure, you'd expect the project that one of the world's greatest film directors had been working on for nearly ten years would be worth waiting for. Well was it? That's the problem - people's expectations were huge. And that has probably detracted from this being a very well made piece of filmmaking.I have seen EWS twice now, and I must say, I liked it much better the second time. The lack of depth that was apparent first time around was absent on a second viewing, and the film showed itself for what it was - a complex, challenging and questioning tale of sexual morality. Perhaps we weren't supposed to ""get it"" first time around, and that the issues and details in the film were so subtle, that a repeat viewing was necessary.I need not dwell on the fact that the cinematography, shooting and craft were excellent. They were, and this was to be expected from Kubrick, a master of the art. But I think people have been unfairly critical of the character development, plot, and ultimate point to the film. This film is comprised of short bursts of high-density dialog and much longer descriptive scenes absent of significant dialog. You have to pay attention during the dialog scenes in particular between Cruise and Kidman, as their relationship, the trust, and secret thoughts therein is at the nub of the film's message.Overall, this is a unique film, both in style and substance, and is, in my mind, ultimately underrated. Kubrick should be awarded the praise he deserves for his last great work.Score: 8/10",Eyes Wide Shut

He's a fearsome figure with a mask...but behind the mask is a fragile little man who is hiding behind his fake persona.Now...let's apply that idea to marriage. We all wear masks, don't we? We put on a persona and we hide the truth. The wife asks if you've ever been attracted to other women and you deny it. You pretend not to notice anyone else, to spare her feelings.So Stanley Kubrick wants to look at this idea of honesty in marriage and relationships. People naked, having sex, yet wearing masks to hide their faces, their true identities, their thoughts. What a clever image! It's a complete mirror image opposite of what we see in the world, people with bodies covered and faces exposed. Is he saying we are at our least honest when we have sex?When Alice Harford opens up to her husband, when she ""unmasks"" and reveals her fantasies about another man, it stuns Dr. Bill Harford to the very core. Her honesty is too much for him. Kubrick let's us know we're in an adult Wizard of Oz. Two girls tell Bill they are taking him to ""where the rainbow ends"". Rainbow colored Christmas tree lights are in almost every shot and Bill gets a mask from ""Rainbow costumes"". And yellow...the color of that brick road, is all about. A yellow cab takes Bill on his journey to the orgy of masked, yet otherwise naked, bodies.When Bill finally goes home, he finds his mask on his wife's pillow. It seems Alice has got his number. He too ""unmasks"" and confesses. Kubrick seems to be suggesting that temptation is dangerous and that the wisest and safest thing a man can do is go home to his wife and get honest with her. Take off the mask, have the courage to expose the fragile man behind the false persona.The other nice thing is the final moment where Alice tells Bill they need to have sex as soon as possible. Sex is an act and perhaps Kubrick is also suggesting people should do it rather than talk about it if they want a happy marriage.As a metaphor of human psychology, Eyes Wide Shut seems to be a film about the value of marriage and family life, and perhaps a film which encourages honestly between men and women, too. As a piece of film making, it's typically outstanding work for the meticulous Mr.Kubrick. It's also a very positive and optimistic film, suggesting that love, marriage and family can resist temptation and the dangers that temptation might bring. All in all, a superb motion picture from a true master of the movies.A final word about Cruise and Kidman.

627,SuMac,Beware - Porno ahead!,5,18 July 1999,"Hey, I'm pretty open-minded, but I don't know how they got the R rating on this film! I love Tom Cruise - and he was great.  But don't get excited gals - he never gets beyond a bare chest and foreplay. On the other hand, Nicole (and every other woman in this film) bares it all - to the point that I was embarrassed for her. The suspense was there, I stuck it out, but it dragged A LOT.Even so it was only mildly irritating until the orgy scenes, which were demeaning to say the least. Everyone in the theater groaned at the ending, expecting a big payoff that never came. Kubrick may have been a master, but I never thought it would be of porn. I'm glad Roger Ebert explained the point of this movie tonight, or I certainly would have missed it. I gave it a lenient 5 of 10 because of Cruise's performance what it could have been!",Eyes Wide Shut

632,Obsidian-4,A Brilliant Finale !!!,10,20 July 1999,"This film is not what it's hyped to be. It is certainly not pornography, it is not even particularly sexy. In fact, there's not very much sex in it! If that's what you come to this film looking for, you'll be very disappointed.If, on the other hand, you're looking for a thoroughly crafted, thoughtful and provocative, beautifully conceived, acted and presented film experience, then you'll hardly do better. Kubrick's films have often gotten indifferent, dismissive and outright negative reviews. Media critics tend to react this way when media events don't live up to the hype they themselves have created. Sadly but not surprisingly, the reviews are so much more predictable than the film itself.Eyes Wide Shut is a film about sex, and about what sex does to us where we live, which is between the ears. The script is rich, tantalizing, playful and full of suspense. The cinematography, design and art direction are sumptuous. The acting is dead on in every single role, and much credit is due Kubrick and Raphael for the body and fullness written into so many of the minor characters.I became a full-fledged Kubrick fan more than 30 years ago at my first viewing of 2001. I've been on his bandwagon ever since, waiting ever longer periods in between his offerings. None of his films has ever presented me with precisely what I thought I was waiting for, and Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. Whatever my initial reaction to his films, I've always found that one, two and five years later they've grown on me, and I've discovered more in them than I first beheld. This one will be savored for a long time. It's a beautiful piece of work!I only wish I could expect that after another long, long wait,  Kubrick would do this to me again! BRAVO Stanley, wherever you are!",Eyes Wide Shut

It is a major disappointment, despite superb technical detailing. Ultimately, it is voyeuristic and un-engaging. Film geeks are foaming at the mouth over a movie that will bore the average intelligent moviegoer to tears.",Eyes Wide Shut
634,mmt02,Sureal Dream...A great finale by Kubrick,10,16 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut will imediately alienate or entice its viewers. Walking out of the theatre, there were many people commenting on how bad it was. For a person looking for a porn film, I guess Eyes Wide Shut had too much plot and too little sex. For a person looking for an erotic thriller, I guess Eyes Wide Shut had too many open-ended questions and too few climatic scenes filled with answers. But for a person looking for a peek into the mind, into that Freudian unconscious, Eyes Wide Shut had plenty of images to contemplate.First of all, like all of Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is about images, visuals. Durring Cruise's ""night on the town"" Kubrick's grainy film mixed with his extensive backlighting creates a dream-like state. The camera is slow and methodic. It shows us all we need to see in this urban dreamscape (minus those pesky digital images!). Because thats what Eyes Wide Shut is: a tour of the human dreamscape, or at least the seedier side of it.The plot moves slowly not concerned that it has left some questions unanswered, because this isn't a film about answers. Here we see another Kubrick signature, the open-ended ending. When those credits role, you'll probably still have questions or maybe you'll want to know what just hit you. Where did Kubrick just take you? What did you just see? I must say that one viewing, which is all that I have had, is insufficient to answer those questions completely.Eyes Wide Shut is an excellent movie that makes you think. Not like The Usual Suspects, but like Persona or 2001 or Blue Velvet, another dream caught up in dreams. It doesn't keep you guessing, it keeps you thinking...well after the credits role. One thing is clear though, this is a must see finale to a wonderful career.",Eyes Wide Shut
635,Matrix-14,Mouth Wide Open. Excellent Masterpiece.,10,18 July 1999,"This movie was amazing. Excellent, excellent film. One of the best movies I've ever seen. I would have known it was film of Kubrick's if I knew nothing about it before seeing it. Halfway through the film at the orgy sequence It was very intense and haunting. The film just drew me in. Something that probably won't happen for most commercial audiences. It is too weird for most people. Most commercial audiences will either love it or just not get it. But people who love Kubrick will love this.The digital mask placing wasn't as bad or as comical as critics say. It would have been nice to see it how it was intended though. And it is a shame that Warner Bros. is more concerned with making money. I'm 17 and I don't think that most people my age or under would want to see this film anyway. It's far too complex.Nicole Kidman was EXCELLENT. Especially in the pot smoking scene. I wouldn't be suprised if she got an Oscar nomination or even an Oscar. Another standout was Alan Cummings as the desk clerk.EYES WIDE SHUT probably won't be nominated for anything else if you go by the Academy's history with Kubrick films.Don't listen to critics. Kubrick's films always got some bad response from critics. You have to see it for yourself.

636,two-ton,Not much here!,1,22 July 1999,"A real long, dull movie.  Don't get me wrong.  I like movies that are heavy on the talking and light on the action, but this one really was boring.  I never thought nudity could be so boring...but it was.  And forget about the two stars.  Their performance weren't anything to write home, or here, about.  The same goes for the co-stars.  Next time I go to a Cruise or Kidman movie, I'll be sure to bring a roll of quarters so I can spend the time playing Pacman in the lobby.",Eyes Wide Shut
637,1-0,Frustrating and honest,6,28 July 1999,"This intense, often frustrating film details the pain, jealousy, and rationalizations of marriage.  This is not to say that it won't appeal to single people, but the movie will most likely resonate most powerfully with anyone who has been in the middle of a marital crisis, or even divorced.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (of course, a real-life married couple) play a couple, flirtatious with strangers, casually flexing their independence, all the while clinging to their marital bond rather for granted.  It's not until a marijuana-induced confession by Kidman's character of a sexual fantasy that the couple's crisis is unveiled, and Cruise's character takes to the streets of NYC looking for answers or relief (by way of any number of sexual situations).  Neither character is given the saint treatment, and the ugly truth that marriage neither means undying devotion or even a promise not to think of sex with another is revealed.  In the end, the characters come to grips with their actions, and attempt coming to grips with each other.  I suppose it's an optimistic ending, wherein they agree to stick with each other for as long as they can, and Kubrick has definitely never been so ""domestic"" on film. 
Of course, the film looks beautiful, and the music can be really effective at setting the mood.  The film is not an overly creepy movie, and I doubt many people are going to be tearing down theaters about the sex.  Truth be told, most people, unless drawn to Kubrick's technical mastery, will have little need to see the film more than once.  It offers a powerful message of the strengths, pains, and trials of marriage -- how you see the movie will depend on your point of view.",Eyes Wide Shut
638,GodEater,BEHOLD!,10,2 May 2000,"Kubrick is one of the greatest masterminds of film EVER. Heck, he may even be THE greatest (I think so).

639,pisces7,Interesting/bizarre,8,19 July 1999,Very often I differ from other film critics and I especially do this time. It has been said that Cruise did a horrible job and i disagree.  I actually thought he did one of his best jobs. Kidman I thought was alright.  Of course she was barely in the movie.  I think there were parts of the movie that could have been a little closer to the heart but I do think I was pulled into the plot.  Lastly I had a major problem with the horrid editing. It took a lot away from the film.  Placing objects in front of scenes and cutting out an ENTIRE scene I think made it not what it was supposed to be. If you want to catch the real thing I think the editors cut on video may be a better idea.,Eyes Wide Shut
640,N.E,a unique film,9,17 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut only shows how talented the man was, showing that he could direct any kind of film and do it well. I see Eyes Wide Shut as kind film that 2001: A Space Odyssey was, a film with a theme that is hard to understand, but a theme none the less.  It is a great film and no one can label it an erotic film or any other kind of movie, but only that it is a Kubrick film.",Eyes Wide Shut
641,sulo,What if the movie had been completed?,6,21 May 2000,"There's no other movie that has been so generously awarded before its premier! Years of headlines about Kubrick, Cruise and Kidman this and that, sex, body doubles, takes and re-re-re-re-re-retakes,hype after hype and finally, Kubrick's death. Which seems like an excuse for leaving the film as it appears. Mediocre. Skeletal. Uncut. Most and foremost: uncut. During the first half an hour I got irritated about the dialogue: - How do ..........you........think about.........that? - ..........How do.........I...........think about..........that? Wellll...... how I.....think about that izzzzz......eehhhh....This is really difficult for me to say....but.....and so on. Kubrick forced his actors act naturally, to act and react, but I don't think all of this slow thinking was meant to appear in the final version. I havent really done any research, but I suppose one third or fourth of the movie could easily have been left out. Of course, the movie would have felt unfinished then, and not the Last Will and Testament of the God.The erotic aspect is OK, but not erotic. Asses and tits come and go, but are more like sculptures. White gypsum copies of the original marble artwork of the antiques. No insight, really. We know that Kubrick didn't actually fool around, meet people, or stay tuned with the world. It shows.The approach is very theatre-like. I actually lost my concentration thinking about how much of the dialogue is Schnitzler and how much isn't. Especially the slimy and sleazy Hungarian, who would very much have wanted to f**k Nicole Kidman, acted nothing like a turn-of-the-millennium-c**t-licking playboy would. Maybe Kubrick thought nothing has changed since the times of the original story.Very sorry. I think Stanley Kubrick was one of the greatest. Eyes Wide Shut is beautifully shot (in Lightbulb Yellow and Nuit Americaine Blue), has a driving screenplay and a genuine no-hurry Kubrick feel, but I still think it's nowhere close to what it would have been, if the director could have worked on it for another five years.",Eyes Wide Shut
642,queenofhalves,The most misunderstood film of the decade,10,22 December 2001,"This movie has been widely hated, even in circles where Kubrick is usually revered. One Salon reviewer even argued that _Eyes Wide Shut_ was a preachy, dogmatic monogamist tract, on the shallow basis that something bad happens to every character that seeks extramarital sex. I couldn't disagree more. The film's final lines suggest both that dreams can be equally as significant as reality, and that a single experience can never define an entire life. Kubrick seems to be saying that a single act of unfaithfulness, whether real or dreamt, does not have to undermine a relationship. Commitment, then, is not a set of arbitrary rules and agreements restricting your partner's sex life, as the Tom Cruise character at first seems to think. This unrealistic, fairy-tale view of his marriage is shattered, plunging him into a surreal, paranoid world of conspiracy and intrigue. By the end, however, he has realized (as his wife already has) that commitment is something renewed from day to day. The film thus points out the dynamic quality of something often considered to be static and constricting, i.e. a marriage, and celebrates commitment without demanding an unrealizable, perfect faithfulness.Despite many critics' assertions to the contrary, _Eyes Wide Shut_ seems to me to be quintessentially Kubrick in its surrealism, its strong use of color (vibrant reds and purples predominate), and its sophisticated theme. An attentive viewer (unlike the majority of American critics) will see that there is much more to this film than a little supposedly explicit sex. Extra props for Kubrick's ability to create a mood that is magical, erotic, and deeply paranoid -- an achievement that rivals David Lynch's best work.",Eyes Wide Shut
643,leica30,Eyes Shut Tight? They Might As Well Be!,5,10 January 2001,"As a Kubrick fan I was disappointed I couldn't get to the cinema to see his swansong. Instead I took the opportunity to see it on pay per view cable tv. I nestled down with the coke and popcorn expecting to see a masterpiece. Then a thought occurred to me. Kubrick was by the time he made this film, an old guy, possibly tired and lacking inspiration.Viewing this film realised my worst fears. Yes, Kubrick blotted his copybook in old age and produced a turkey. Eyes Wide Shut is Kubrick's worst film. Despite the desperate excuses of Kubrick fans this film goes nowhere, it has nothing new to say and employs dull cinematography.I also think Tom Cruise is too lightweight to be taken seriously in a dark role such as this and his wife Nicole Kidman is underused, merely appearing as a dumb housewife. You do get to see her bum though.One critic described this film as an old man's dirty fantasy. I have to agree. Although I enjoy erotica such as Cronenberg's ""Crash"", Eyes Wide Shut went absolutely nowhere, leaving me bored and unfulfilled.You will enjoy the odd flashes of nudity but the story is pointless. We all know there are pervs out there, acting out sexy role play. So what! The scene in the shop tells us that young women are pimped by ruthless people, but we know that already. Thailand is a good example.Kubrick has attempted to show us something we have known for years and thats why this film falls down. It doesn't shock. It doesnt't titilate. And it doesn't entertain.",Eyes Wide Shut

It's difficult to do satanic-genre scenes well - but there are far, far, better examples. And Kubrick has even managed to make the gorgeous Nicole look awful.

646,mambo_man,"From Stanley, with love",10,4 May 2002,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" isn't Stanley Kubrick's greatest film but then Kubrick's genius was such that he set the bar of his own standards so ridiculously high that even his lesser works are fascinating, compelling and essential.Such is ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  Despite the tremendous handicap of featuring Nicole Kidman (an actor so impossibly bad that the only positive contributions she makes to the film is when she is naked or silent), Kubrick has crafted a beautiful, complex, almost mystical film that works on layers and levels unimagined by most all of the film makers filling today's cinemas.In short, Kubrick has created a fascinating character study, based on the flawed and dichotomous Bill Harford as he attempts to reconcile modern modes of sexual conduct with his highly traditional modes of moral conduct. Sexual desire and insecurity is portrayed as an underwold, while everyman Cruise has to navigate through it like a modern Ulyesses searching for his Penelope (now there's a modern irony....)Perhaps mostly importantly, though, Kubrick weaves through ""Eyes Wide Shut"" a number of touching and occasionally humourous homages to his own work - almost as if sensing his own time was short.  The shot of Leelee Sobieki backing away from Cruise is burned in my memory as sheer Kubrick genius.  A wonderful, evocative soundtrack, sumptuous shots, inventive lighting and the remote decadence that only Kubrick can conjure all contribute to the feeling that this film is washing over you, inviting you to delve into it and lose yourself deeper into it's mystery and dark recesses.In short, a film that survives Kidman (how does this woman get work?  have people lost Laura Dern or Julianne Moore's phone number?)and in no way diminished the non pariel reputation of Stanley Kubrick, the master film maker and one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.",Eyes Wide Shut
647,zakso999,Kubrick's Curtain Call and one of the Very Few Films to Change My Life,10,16 January 2012,"Kubrick's film career is quite an impressive one. He can do no wrong. Every single movie he has made has gotten largely positive reviews and now withstand the test of time. Even if one of his movies meets with mixed reviews, it later goes on to get largely positive reviews later (The Shining is a prime example). Kubrick has contributed to nearly every genre of film, even comedy (Dr. Strangelove). Now let's talk about Eyes Wide Shut. This film is often regarded as Kubrick's one mistake. I say otherwise. While I will agree that the film was very long and some scenes were unbearably slow (take the final scene with Tom Cruise and Sydney Pollack for example), the film has some very sincere messages about sexual jealousy, and what it truly means to be committed, the directing is absolutely brilliant, the writing is tremendous. As for the acting, they probably could've done better.Now one thing that I want to bring up is the controversy over the film's erotic content. Yes, the film is erotic and contains some sex and nudity, it is an erotic movie. However, it is NOT meant to titillate or arouse. The film suffered from a very bad marketing campaign that implied that the film was a sexual exploitation film. This film is sorely misunderstood.This film actually helped strengthen my relationships and really affected me emotionally, and mentally. I actually felt myself become wiser because of this movie. Bottom Line: I believe that, if you love Kubrick films, and can sit through a 2 and a 1/2 hour film with a bit of jabber, you will enjoy Kubrick's final masterpiece.**** and a half out of *****",Eyes Wide Shut
648,winterhaze13,"Odyssey of love, lust and reawakening.",10,8 January 2005,"When this film was released there was a small minority of critics who did not like this film. But like many Kubrick films Eyes Wide Shut is ahead of its time in terms of artistic impression and thought-provocation.First I will like to talk about some of the criticisms many had about this film when it was first released. The slow pace at the beginning and the seemingly ""staged atmosphere"" is believed to have been created to convey a ""dream-like"" ambiance. I don't know whether everyone will find this film compelling but I think the ambiguity of the plot creates everything open to interpretation. After his wife Alice(Kidman) confesses a near act of infidelity, the ""good-doctor"" Bill Harbord(Cruise) goes on an odyssey-like walk through the empty streets on New York (Its suppose to symbolize his spiritual emptiness), in a vindictive pursuit to prove his character as a man. When meeting his friend Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), he learns of an underground society that indulges in group sex. Realizing this is the opportunity to reassure himself he ventures into the society only to be revealed as an intruder and cast out. He then tries to retrace his steps in true Kubrick fashion.This film like most of Kubrick's films is artsy and rigorous picture that is just simply not designed for everyone to like because contrary to what you might think it is unique and unconventional. Can you name a film that resembles Eyes Wide Shut in terms of the density of the storyline, emotionally intense, psychologically compelling and strangely thought-provoking? You likely can't because it is a anomaly in a bland and rigid film industry.If you did not like this film, I suggest that you watch this film again and think about what I said and OPEN-UP to it. Take it for what it is trying to put forth. I've heard many people say that the first time they saw this film they did not understand it, but later came to enjoy it. And this is the case for many Kubrick films. In fact when I first saw A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, as well as Dr. Strangelove I could not understand why the academy considers them classics, but they grew on me as well.In the end, Eyes Wide Shut like 2001: A Space Odyssey will be a film that was misunderstood by many people when it came out but inevitably will be widely considered as another landmark in the career of the greatest film-maker of all-time.Rating: 10/10 A Kubrick Classic",Eyes Wide Shut

A lot of Tom & Nicole fans probably won't know quite what to make of this movie. But Cruise & Kidman, to paraphrase Chris Isaak, did a good, good thing by exposing Kubrick's work to a lot of people who might otherwise never have seen it.I was amused to read that some critics didn't think it was ""sexy"" enough, which misses the point completely. What makes sex sexy is intimacy, which almost all the characters in the movie are lacking. The tender scenes with the prostitute and (late in the film) with his wife are more compelling than any of the ""sexy"" scenes in the movie.I hope that someday we'll able to see it as Kubrick originally intended - without the computerized revelers in the orgy scenes. Cruise's character is on a voyeuristic journey for an hour and a half, only to have digital bodies inserted in front of what he really wanted to see. His breakdown in front of his wife afterward would have been much more compelling had we seen the horrors that he did. Again, simulated violence is more palatable to the MPAA than simulated sex is.

I realize we were running a bit long here, but...And don't you think Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman already take themselves a little too seriously? Nevertheless, thank you Stanley Kubrick.

It does not have something to do with age to be able to see this film not as a primitive porn but with intelligence.

When Dr. Bill is insulted-turned on-driven by Alice's (his wife) story of her enormous attraction to a naval officer (""I was willing to give up everything... for the promise of just one night with him."") he departs on a fruitless journey in which he attempts to dive into carnality. Yet, in  his extramarital dealings he finds only deep depravity and perversion.Flaws are present in the RED SHOE DIARIES style Kubrick brings to his representation of Alice's fantasy or the way he decides to end his orgy centerpiece (it feels like a major cop out, certainly not worthy of what we have seen (or were allowed to see) up to that point.  Still the film is an eloquent, deeply felt masterpiece, worthy of inclusion into any Kubrick Collection. Still it would have been interesting to see what changes Kubrick would have made to the film's drugged out pace or just how he would have handled the highly controversial dealings with the MPAA.

It will be the same with EWS. I'm really surprised by the many ignorant reviews, that have been written on this film. As always Kubrick didn't deliver the film everybody expected. This film is not so much about sex (it's not even sexy), the theme of the movie is fear and how we are incapable of handling sex in the age after the sexual revolution.Camera work is extraordinary.",Eyes Wide Shut
661,Tiff-8,"Decent, but no masterpiece",8,16 July 1999,"Unfortunately, Stanley Kubrick's last movie was not on the same scale as his classics, in my opinion.  I went to the earliest showing on the first day it was released (in San Jose) because I had been waiting in anticipation for quite some time.  I wanted to love this movie. Maybe that's my problem; my hopes were too high.The story revolves around Cruise's character, Bill Hartford, and the sexual quest he goes on after an argument with his wife. During the argument, which is over a difference in opinion about the true sexual desires of men vs. women, Bill's wife Alice (Kidman) tells him about her attempt to have a one-night stand with a naval officer a year ago.  If the officer had obliged, she would have risked everything to have sex with him.This revelation really sets Bill off.  The possibility that he was completely wrong about his wife and her unquestioning fidelity drives him mad.  Perhaps to avoid a reality quite opposite to the one he was living in (where men are controlled by their desire to have casual sex with many different women and women just want to be married and have sex with their husband) he sets out for an evening of cheap sex.  Ironically, his attempts at having affairs don't pan outThe controversial orgy scene is entertaining and a little creepy, but I wonder what the unedited portion would have been like.  Maybe that version will make it to the U.S. on video next year.  In any case, I won't be surprised if this flick gets great reviews, especially from men, for one or more of the following reasons:1) Directed by Stanley Kubrick, and his last film, no less.   2) Nicole Kidman has some nude scenes.   3) There is an orgy scene.   3)a.

The acting is amazing, and carries what is not an otherwise notable story.  The artistic direction alone is breathtaking and makes this movie worth seeing.

It took its time, set up the tensions and arguments with authority, and gave me a chance to feel those tensions along with Cruise's tortured character.  Kubrick did a marvelous job of re-creating Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle"" and, as he often has with other works, managed to improve upon it.  He gave us a portrait of a man who is following his strongest dreams-- the ones that show him what he cannot be.  Nicole Kidman was perfect as the doctor's wife.  Some critics have complained that she didn't get enough screen time.  I would say she had all she needed.  Every word she said cut Cruise deeply enough to keep him bleeding throughout the film.   I enjoyed the work immensely.  When the credits rolled, I was surprised to find that three hours had passed.There are critics who have reported that the film wasn't as sexy or conventionally thrilling as they expected.  To them I would say ""Grow up."" This is a film that meditates on the meaning of fidelity to a man's nature. Why are we faithful?  What are we giving up when we turn away an offer from a stranger?    It will haunt and provoke for decades to come, long after Joe Eszterhas and Brian DePalma have faded from our memories.  If you want stroke material, there are movie houses that cater to that taste.

I had some good laughs in this movie, that's quite unusual for a Kubrick movie. Anyway, the acting is very good, I feel that Tom Cruise reprises his role all the time when Nicole Kidman makes a amazing acting. I hope she gets an Academy nomination.

It's not hard to picture Kubrick shooting and reshooting scenes time after time, in order to capture just the right angle, just the right shadow, just the right expression. I was captivated from the start by this story which plunges the very depths of human sexuality, yet makes a strong statement for marriage and family as being the genuine answer to the more base and carnal lusts within us all. I looked at my wife at one point, and she had her hands over her ears as the piano played (you'll understand when you see it). Kubrick's use of imagery and music to torture while informing his viewer had me on the edge of my seat for the entire movie. Kubrick never insults the intelligence of his viewer. EWS is a riveting and powerful exploration of the human condition...ala A Clockwork Orange. Thanks Stanley!",Eyes Wide Shut

It is neither Kubrick's greatest masterpiece, nor an absolute disappointment, but something in between.I was left with the impression that Kubrick may have not quite finished this film before he died. A little more editing could have tightened things up. Kidman's performance is strong, while Cruise wanders somewhere between very good and half-asleep.This film is not an erotic film, nor is it really a thriller, although it contains elements of both. It is a pretty good attempt at exploring a marital relationship and the impact of jealousy on that relationship.A wonderfully effective soundtrack helps keep people on edge and I am still a little on edge some days after seeing it.

668,zazoo-2,I can't believe I watched the whole thing....,7,25 April 2000,"I can't believe that Tom Cruise and Nichole Kidman could have lowered themselves to do such a horrid movie. If you can stay awake through all the street walking and driving around in the car scenes you are rewarded by conversations between characters you don't even care about,  Tom Cruise's blank stares and Nichole Kidman's whinny, crying, stupid dreams were just too much. If Stanley Kubrick set out to make another really bizzare film he missed the mark on this one. It could have been a whole lot better. The whole movie was a let down. As far as this supposedly being a thriller, I wasn't  thrilled. Thrill is created when something dangerous is possibly going to happen to a character that as been developed  in such a way that you CAN care about them. As I said, I couldn't have cared less about these people. If there was suppose to be some kind of psychological lesson to learn it was all to vague and scattered to grasp with any clear cut definition. I can only figure that it's the nudity, unbridled sex and sexual fantasy that getting the ""10"" ratings from the men. If the sex and female nudity were not such a big part of this film I doubt that many men could have stayed awake through it!

669,Monkhead,This one grows on you - Spoiler,8,26 May 2000,"Bottom line with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" for me is this - I loved it. And most of my friends chastised me for that because they hated it.  Hearing their perspective, this is what I concluded - most people want films that ZIP along, especially if we're talking about the summer market.  Also, most don't want a film that's open to interpretation.  That's work.  Well, I didn't mind the work.  There's a haunting beauty and imagery to this film that lingers with you, no matter how much you may despise the overall package.  And as for that ""package,"" here's what I surmise (after sharing this viewpoint with my friends, they seemed more open to the experience)...I interpreted the film as one big dream sequence for Cruise's character (hence the title) that takes place after the pot-smoking catalyst/1st Act Turning Point.  Once in the dream, he's offered one sexual fantasy after another, but each fantasy turns out to be a nightmare, i.e.: the girl in the costume shop, the hooker with AIDS, the orgy gone awry, the death of the orgy-savior-girl, etc.  It's only when Dr. Bill opens up his feelings to his wife at the story's close that he can fully consummate his primal urge.Unfortunately, the mainstream market can't embrace a movie like this because it's so open to interpretation.  The cineplex crowd doesn't want to sit there and work out the ""meaning"" while downing their Junior Mints.  What's confounding is that even the critics and die-hard Kubrick fans threw in the towel on this one.  Bummer.  Because like Kubrick's previous films, this one requires more of an open mind.  If you take on the film as a dream, then all bets are off and suddenly, you're in the hands of someone who's reinventing the conventional mode of storytelling.  Maybe in time, people will realize how beautiful this film is.  It sure beats sitting through ""Battlefield Earth.""",Eyes Wide Shut
670,jvincent1,"Complex and Compelling, but I'm Tired of American Censorship.",10,20 July 2007,"The older Kubrick grew, the more he tired of the limitations imposed by traditional story-telling, as the complexity of the structures of his last two films, Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut, clearly reveal. Had he lived, I'm of the opinion his films would have reflected a combination of his old, traditional eastern European values merged with some hybrid form of David Lynchian narrative structureless, creating a result I cannot even imagine. Debate on future Kubrick films, assuming he lived, would have been most interesting. But, this is not my point. It's those damn little digitalized images which intrude upon the orgy scene in Eyes Wide Shut which have my attention, because, in the United States, those brief little computer-made creatures followed the film to DVD. I was determined to find a way to remove them, so I could enjoy Kubrick's final film in its purest form just like our brothers and sisters across the ocean. I'm sure most persons could care less, but there does exist a small number of film buffs willing to go a little farther in order to eliminate problems of this sort, because there are solutions out there, you just gotta find out what they are. DVD players and the DVDs also are manufactured to be compatible according to its region. The almighty powers of the DVD empire have divided the world into twelve regions, and, for example, since the U.S. is coded region 1, only DVD players manufactured for that region will play DVDs also with region 1 coding. How do you ascertain the region of a DVD? On the back side of most DVD cases, if you will look carefully towards the bottom of it, you will find an image of the globe, sometimes encased in a rectangular little box, others shaped like a global football, and in the middle of that little globe is a number, which in our case is always a number 1. It's not always easy to spot this small globe and number, but believe me, it's usually there. Now, if you were to come across a European DVD in its case, you'll find that same globe but the number in its middle will be a 2, rather than a 1. That's because most European DVD players and discs are manufactured for each other, and in Europe's case, that's region 2. Now, put a region 1 DVD (U.S.) into a European DVD player, and what happens? Nothing happens. You get no picture. The player and disc are very simply not compatible. Very often, when you're on a movie site, looking to buy or rent a foreign film that you've read about, etc., when examining the DVD's specifications, you'll reach a point where it warns you about region compatibility, or the possible lack thereof. Major foreign films, those that have gained a certain level of notoriety among film enthusiasts, very often are available in region 1 format. However, that's not the case for a far greater number of films from other countries. Surprisingly, certain American films are available only through some foreign distributor, in, say, a region 4 format for example. Orson Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons can be purchased only as a region 6 DVD. David Lynch's Lost Highways, until recently, was available for purchase only as a region 2 disc, and this still is the only region in which you can obtain the film in its theater aspect ratio. In addition to this region compatibility problem, the DVDS of films from other countries often have video signals in the PAL format while many American televisions come only in the NTSC system, which basically means your colors will not match and, hence, lousy picture. I'm not very comfortable addressing the contradictions of mixing PAL and NTSC DVD other than to say, it will not work. With all these different regions for different foreign and domestic movies on DVD and PAL encoding for American DVD players designed to handle region 1, NTSC DVDs, is there a way to make it all work? Absolutely. With the region-free or multi-region or all region DVD player, all these problems promptly disappear, and any DVD will perform nicely in a DVD player of this nature. At a price no higher than a regular DVD player bought at the local chain electronics store. Don't look for a region free DVD player there, however. It only sells regular region 1 DVD players for those region 1 DVDs which it also sells. So, where do you go to buy one of these region-free players? The answer is on line. There are many, many sites which offer these type players. I don't know whether you can mention products or stores on here, so I will not do so, but you can email me and I'll refer you to the place where I bought mine, which has operated smoothly for about two years without any trouble, and many, many films have run through it over the course of that time. With this region-free DVD player, I purchased a region 2 version of Eyes Wide Shut on DVD, and watched the film without the insertion of those damned digital images in the orgy scene. It was a little thing, but it mattered to me, as do all the other foreign (and some domestic) films I've purchased and watched several times. With all this hoopla about the coming of high-definition DVD, a battle for supremacy between two competitors and the eventual winner an unknown for several years to come, you're better off with a much, much less expensive region-free player which will greatly expand the diversity of your collection. One other thing about the high-definition competition: the eventual loser will fade at about the same rate as VHS has to DVD, and its products are not compatible with those of its competitor and visa versa.

There is a lot of nudity, which is fine by me. There is plenty of suspense, which is intensified by the slowness and quietness of each scene.  One of Kubrick's best films.

It is both relaxing and intense all at the same time.",Eyes Wide Shut
672,patricktday,Hair-raising uncertainty,8,3 September 2021,"Eyes Wide Shut is the remarkable final film by Stanley Kubrick, the enigmatic and revered auteur. The picture preceded his death by mere months and cements his legacy as one of the greatest filmmakers all time.One of the most immediately captivating elements of this movie is its music - the sounds that accompany Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) around the city of New York are not those of some inner-city melody like one might expect, but rather an isolating, low and rumbling yet volatile piano ballad whose unpredictability mirrors that of the film. The piece begins piercing yet somewhat distant, as the knife-like keys stab and echo towards the audience, before these knives are drowned by the deep gurgle of the lower piano notes, occasionally and incalculably writhing out between those low tones for another stab at the audience's ears. Though simple, this recurring theme does wonders in terms of building the atmosphere and unease within a scene as well as heightening the experience of the film when aligned with Kubrick's fantastic images.Such images are powerful because of their contrast to reality; the film is littered with Christmas lights and colours associated with joviality: shades of green, red, orange, yellow, pink, but as the story unfolds this vibrancy seems to contrast the film's darkness, like an inviting masquerade serving as conspiratorial subterfuge.Everything in this movie contributes to the atmosphere: one of darkness and anxiety. The city, with what few glimpses we see of it, feels alive, lurking in the pit of its own darkness, waiting to accommodate the dark fantasies of the protagonist with both its narrow streets as well as its neon signs and dim-lit bars.Although the most important quality within the film is not mere images in a vacuum, you can have a good-looking film and still, it is without soul if it is without engaging storytelling. Luckily, the movie thrives here, too. The structure of Eyes Wide Shut is certainly off-kilter (though not to the degree of a 2001 or Full Metal Jacket) featuring a myriad of deliberately drawn out scenes both near the beginning and end. The picture takes little time to introduce itself, instead opting to throw itself head-first into the arms of its own plot almost immediately. This structure is extremely refreshing and makes the movie stand out from the very first frame. Eyes Wide Shut is simultaneously quick yet careful, it indulges in the characters and setting to such an immense degree, yet it takes so little time to acquaint the audience with these aspects of the film that the embellishment feels less like your average introductory phase and more like peeling back layers of characters you already know despite having just met them, in a place you're used to despite having never seen. This sense of familiarity soon fades, though, when Bill gets himself wrapped up in either what could be a conspiracy, the calibre of which seems to envelope the entire city, or gets himself wrapped in what could also merely be his own paranoia.The film's true glory is that either could be true; it is left ambiguous, but interestingly so: there is evidence for both conclusions. A trail of upscaling violence left in Bill's wake, a chain made in bruises and overdoses, but then justified by the only common acquaintance and ""friend"" Bill has - Victor - as being merely circumstantial. The afore mentioned long sequences of Eyes Wide Shut build not only the atmosphere, but the film's mystique, also. It is a remarkable (and intentional) irony that the more the audience is made aware of, the less they actually know; instead of answering these larger-than-life questions with lazy expository dialogue, tacked on at the film's end to give cohesion to dangling threads left in the writer's self-made pigeon-hole they locked themselves into, Kubrick ensures that Bill's inquires only add to the unknown.This show of smoke and mirrors never truly ends, it only becomes yet more eery, more bold and more inventive as the film nears its end, supplying the audience with an incessant stream of unnerving scenarios to fuel the intangible sense of dread at the core of the film. The inquiries Bill makes do end up feeling ""pointless"", as they were tactfully labelled by the movie's featured cult, but not in a way that is indicative of feeble writing or material that should be removed, but rather the powerlessness of Bill's investigations continuously builds the hopeless and paralysing questions within the audience's heads.However, the film is not perfect. For example, Alice (Nicole Kidman) has two monologues, one where she depicts a dream lacking in any subtlety in a scene which spans over five minutes, as well as her monologue about a Navy man, and both are underwhelming. The latter is not quite as offensive, it begins promising but is extended past its welcome, reiterating itself over and over while causing an already massive scene which was hitherto brilliant to taper off at the tail end. The former, though, is dreadful: Alice drones on and on for over five minutes about a surface-level dream epitomising obviousness, and despite the point of this lengthy scene being advertised instantaneously, the character and script continue to babble on uninterestingly for several minutes without ever switching subject. It is needlessly drawn out. These moments could be viewed as necessary (without them Bill would lack motive or conflict and the plot would stagnate, and it provides insight into the characters which are otherwise brilliant) or even ""pivotal"" - yet they are boring; the movie proves it is possible to be both. These instances detract from the larger whole of the film and take the audience out of the experience where it could have been avoided, although it doesn't take long to slip back into the film's world, which is enthralling until the credits roll.Perhaps some viewers may be discontented by the lack of a real conclusion to the cult plot, but arguably this lack of transparency is what works best for the film. Even at the end, when somewhat of a ""happy ending"" is reached, the audience will still be paranoid, locked into their seats and awaiting tragedy. An awareness springs, and the amicability of the imagery becomes... sinister. In the movie's final moments we see the couple's daughter walk off, perhaps accompanied by, or - at least alongside - two older men, dressed in coats frighteningly similar to those found in the fantastic mansion section of the movie. They walk off, never to be seen again, with the daughter next to them. Perhaps it's a mistake, perhaps it's intentional. It could be the cult men returning to punish Bill for breaking his oath to tell no-one of the cult, or nothing. The movie is so meticulous in its obstinate refusal to reveal anything that truthfully, it doesn't matter. This could be some horrific hidden ending or nothing at all, but the fact that something lurking in the background of a scene can be discussed akin to a core element of a lesser movie is indicative of Kubrick's reputation for perfection, as well as his ability to manipulate audiences into being hyper-aware of everything, just like Bill Hartford, as a result of experiencing this movie.Eyes Wide Shut is almost wholly unique, with its surreal mansion segment which may go down as one of the best cinematic sequences of all time - especially with its parallels to reality we uncover every day in the modern age - with its intensely oppressive atmosphere of paranoia, sexual frustration and fear. There's a lot to love about this movie, and it's an experience which verges on transcendent; as it finishes, the haunting nature of both major and minute details will remain, and the movie will be left - like those hair-raising piano keys that accompany it so well - to echo in the minds of its audience, as the film refuses to remove its mask.",Eyes Wide Shut
673,lathbury,A Precursor to the Precursor,8,3 July 2016,"A little drawn out and predictable but still riveting and highly charged with tension, the plot lines are neatly—if somewhat over-literally—tied up. The final scene in which Kidman (Alice Hartford) suggests behavior to resolve the sexual mistrust between her and her husband seems to me reductive and not to answer the exciting questions about the place of the libido in married life, i. e., the discussion that precipitated the action.Everything implied or said in the movie is in a 5200 word short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne, ""Young Goodman Brown"" (1835). The sex (more implied than explicit), the uncertainty, and the guilt are all there; Hawthorne's story is told with more tact, with a clearer philosophical framework and less self-consciousness than in Kubrik's film, which I still liked, though.",Eyes Wide Shut

I can only hope that it is better than this on-screen adaptation.I found this movie to be boring. I could barely keep myself in front of the television through to the end, and I was almost angry with myself that I had, given the fact that it ends in about the worst possible manner. It has one of the lamest endings in recorded history. All in all, I would say you are far better off to spend your time watching Stanley Kubrick's earlier works. They FAR surpass this confused, pointless, uninteresting work. The only reason I rated it above a 1 is that some of the scenes are visually stimulating and put together well.

676,rasmushelms,Kubrick's Bows Out With Style,9,28 May 2014,"Like pretty much all of Kubrick's other films, I think that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" will grow in stature with time. Although not his strongest film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is still a compelling picture, mostly due to the trance-like atmosphere it creates.The dreamlike mood that permeates the film, as well as the strange characters Tom Cruise's character encounters, almost makes this seem like a David Lynch film. Nevertheless, one is never in doubt that this is a Kubrick film, as each shot is meticulously crafted with Kubrick's trademark visual elegance. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is meant to be Kubrick's exploration of sexual relations. Its deals with themes of lust and jealousy, and how these innate human characteristics can take their toll on a relationship. Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) play the married couple whose relationship begins to unravel when Alice admits she had sexual fantasies about another man, sparking Bill's jealousy and causing him to go on a sexual adventure that takes him to places he never could have imagined. Its here that the film is most compelling, and delivers some of the most memorable scenes ever to grace a Kubrick film. Although the pace of the film is quite slow, this is important in creating the dreamlike atmosphere, and the plot still remains intriguing. I was never bored. Cruise and Kidman both deliver strong performances. However, as per usual with any Kubrick film, its the director that is the star of the show. Although I'm a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick, this is probably the one complaint I would have about his style, as I feel that his perfectionism can sometimes detract from the raw quality of the performances. Its not often that I come away from his films feeling like I truly know the characters or have gone through fire and hell with them. Nevertheless, the film is a visual treat, and that is the reason that I keep coming back to Kubrick: he is a visionary with images.""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the last stunning work of the director's illustrious career. Its a fitting end to his legacy.",Eyes Wide Shut

678,danduda1,An intriguing mystery,7,18 June 2013,"The thing that struck me most the first time I saw this was what a good movie mystery it is. We're following a character down the street; something's around the corner, we don't know what it is, neither does he...That's still one of my favorite things about it. It's also a lot about sex - but it all feels very cold for us in the audience; nothing ever feels sexy. When I thought over Kubrick's films, this at first seemed an odd choice. Then I realized he has depicted sex a lot - but always in very non-erotic ways. For instance, ""Lolita"" is about an older man's desperate desire for a young girl. But it's his doomed attempt at finding happiness through possessing her that endures in the mind, not anything sexual.""Eyes Wide Shut"" depicts many characters trying to, or having sex with each other - but never in ways that seem sexy. One undercurrent is that people are, or are trying to, feed on one another, in an almost animal-like way.Another theme is a husband, Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) trying to find a safe sexual outlet outside of his marriage, outside his wife (Nicole Kidman). Perhaps reflecting the fears of the times, almost every one he finds turn out to be potentially deadly.There's also a secret society engaged in satanic sex rituals.We are left questioning whether or not a woman was murdered after she offered herself as some kind of sacrifice in the doctor's place, when he is uncovered as an outsider who doesn't belong at their party. Questions left unanswered include: why do they allow the doctor to see and learn so much about them? And why would this woman do this (if, in fact, she does)?Sydney Pollack's character Victor Ziegler may be the clue to our unraveling what's happening just on a simple narrative level. Take a close look at what he's doing right before doctor Bill enters his upstairs chamber, at the first party . For me, it confirmed my fears of about what Ziegler tells the doctor towards the end of the film (a scene that has my vote as the most frightening, diabolical dialogue scene of the decade). We'd like to believe Ziegler is telling Dr. Harford the truth - but the assurance we would feel if we knew he was is denied us.The mystery surrounding the secret society is more compelling than the story that frames it, so when the conclusion returns to the issues the doctor and his wife are trying to resolve, things feel less interesting. Maybe this was another joke Kubrick was making - obsessions over sex can sometimes leave one with anti-climactic feelings.",Eyes Wide Shut

This delivers. Some brilliant eerie parts that I am glad I paid for so I could watch them in my own time and without interruption.The film itself is better than average. But it does get confusing and somewhat cryptic towards the end. Also the scenes where Nicole Kidman's character is acting strangely/hysterically were dire and I skipped past them. Shorter, more controlled sections would have been better, for my own tastes only, of course.Of the three Kubrick films I have seen this one goes after The Shining, Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket. But it has high production values and if you can get your head around the end, an interesting story to boot!",Eyes Wide Shut

But there is so much more to the movie than just these things. It is a story of a journey into the insanity of nighttime and the bizarre lives others live without us even knowing. Then, it is about trying to get out of the rabbit hole after experiencing this.
This movie is built around atmosphere and is really not supposed to be realistic, but rather the isolation that covers the frame or the excess is supposed to give a feel for this strange world that the characters inhabit. The films high amount of sex is used more as a metaphor for the other parts of ourselves that we do not want the rest of the world to know about.
Kubrick's last gem to us all and it is necessary to watch, so don't keep your eyes wide shut to this film.",Eyes Wide Shut
683,jackalchow,Kubrick's style is lasting and consistent,8,11 December 2006,"I have watched 6 of Kubrick' s production so far, his style kept unchanged except for AI which was not completed by him.The films of Stanley mostly reflect his philosophy to community and humanity. So most of the films will not have very abundant story content. He abandoned to develop the script in a way that our of audience's expectation(or what I feel unexpected is that those movies having an ending in such way). If you don't concern the showing time, you won't think that the story has just be completed in such a way. Instead, he portrayed in details about Tom Curise's psychological contradiction. The career and appearance of Tom Curise acted made him to be very appreciated by females. The banquet was arranged to be shown in the beginning highly reflected the live of the couple. Suspect was also initiated in it, even the opening dialogue revealed the lurk of this couple who seems to have a perfect family.Afterwards, once Tom knew that Kiman was almost cheated him, his self-struggle became stronger and the tension of the movie increased gradually, where the peak was reached by Tom attending the potential dangerous odyssey. But he still couldn't take the revenge to his wife as what he try to do was actually based on his jealousy (even he have never met the sailor, the flashback of his imagination about the sexual behavior between that guy with Kiman). He had noting to do and that's why such nightmare couldn't let him overcome his sincere to his wife. That's why he told everything to her as he couldn't play the game of cheating his wife by wearing the mask.In addition, I am especially impressed by the continuous dissolving editing in the scene of Tom going to the sexual party. The taxi across from the crowded city to the silence area. With a dissolved way that made audience also fell into the dream around, as well as the mystery.Kubrick played the similar action to it by keeping the place be secret all the time including at the end of the film. It is unimportant to know the secret behind anymore(although many people like to know the truth of it:curiosity for all). That is what the master ability of achieving this. By doing such action, the film won't be too long and the main message will be shown clearly rather than the audience changing the focus on that incident.Next,it made the crossover between reality and dream: one of the philosophical argument in the world. People usually confused and mix real world and dream, they may even don't know which one is real. Probably what we think our daily live is real one but the fact may still be hidden(Martix reflected more about this topic).",Eyes Wide Shut
684,nickarsenev,R.I.P. Stanley Kubrick.,8,16 October 2019,"Stanley Kubrick was a genius... of sort?What is Eyes Wide Shut about? Is it about moral decay of the upper class? Is it about marriage ? Is it about jealousy? Is it about the rules of society (something like ""there's always a bigger fish"") or about secret masonic-illuminati clubs? I often hear people say about different directors/authors that ""His/her films/books are about everything"". Well if someone filmed about everything - it was Kubrick, for sure. Eyes Wide Shut, just as Space Odyssey, just as Full Metal Jacket, - is about everything and about nothing at the same time. It's open for interpretations and almost every viewer will, most likely, even unwillingly, interpret it in their own personal way. I say ""almost"" because Eyes Wide Shut is a long film, as most of Kubrick's works, and many people just don't get sucked in by it as much as Kubrick adorers do. And this film is a trance even more than the rest Kubrick films (apart from 2001, perhaps).Now, a lot of people call Stanley Kubrick a stylist. I'm not sure I can agree with that most of the times. He was sophisticated and precise in what he wanted the viewer to be able to see in the shot and where he wants the viewer's attention. But at the same time his films feel almost raw. The shots are very simple. And this is especially the case with Eyes Wide Shut.Still, the ritual scene is one of my favorite scenes of all time. I don't know why. Can't even explain it as, again, it's not stylish or tricky in any way, but I just love it.The conspiracy thery about Kubrick's death, the ""seized by the studio"" 24 minutes of the film etc. was on my mind almost the whole time I was thinking about Eyes Wide Shut and rewatching it. I don't know and I'm sure that not a lot do know about how many of this is true, but I still imagine how perfect it could've been with all the missing scenes (if they exist). I must say that I had a feeling that the movie is kind of incomplete after I've seen it the first time, not knowing about the WB-Illuminati shinenigans at all. And rewatching it again made me feel even more like it.Regardless of if it was on purpose by Kubrick or not, I'd love to literally see more of this film, I'd love for it to continue and not to end on such a teasing note, almost mocking me as a viewer (and a man!). Otherwise, not my favorite film by Kubrick, but certainly not less deep than all the others. I was born 6 months after Stanley Kubrick died but I still miss him. 8/10. October 16, 2019.P.S. Lots of naked girls in this film. And I mean LOTS of em. Be aware.",Eyes Wide Shut

It does a lousy, boring job of that. Cruise is so secure in his wife's love for him that when she tells him of a fantasy she once had about a stranger she saw (didn't meet, just saw him a couple of times) Tom losses his invulnerability and begins to act in ways I considered quite irrationally. Jeez, Tom, have you never fantasized?What this movie could've been was a good mystery, which it becomes for the last third. That, however, is destroyed when the cat is let out of the bag in a confession, not by a bad guy that's caught, but by a relatively good guy that has apparently decided the movie has gone on long enough for us to get that point about relationships, trust and jealousy, mystery be damned.",Eyes Wide Shut

687,AnaBH,Go for the raw!,5,26 July 1999,"I've always liked Kubrick and respected his previous movies. I have to say though I was quite disappointed with EWS.  Let's not even take all the hype into consideration. Let's look at the movie for itself. 
From the first scene of the movie where Alice (Kidman) is in the bathroom urinating then standing up and wiping herself to the final last line I wonder what????  Kubrick went for every raw shot he could get in this movie. There was more (or as much) T & A in this movie than in a soft porn one. I'm still trying to figure out where the eroticism is.  Many of the scenes were just for reaction.  What was the point of the Leelee Sobieski part?  I have no clue, does anyone?I can understand the premise of Cruise's obsession upon learning of his wife's fantasy and the depth of that fantasy.  His visit to the prostitute and the mansion where the secret sexual rituals take place bring to fruition his ""I'll show you"" attitude.EWS has it's moments, but never truly comes together.  There are too many unanswered questions.  What really happened to his piano playing friend? Did the girl who saved him really die by her own hand?  What was the purpose of the scene with the young girl (Sobieski) and the Asian men?  How/Where did Alice (Kidman) find the mask?Lastly, too often the acting was totally unbelievable.  In the poignant scene when Alice is telling her husband about her fantasy, and they're discussing jealousy, I felt like I was watching Cruise do a bad imitation of Jack Nicholson.  He went on to attempt to act like a man losing his grip when he visited the morgue and then towards the end when some things are revealed to the audience via his rich friend, contrarily, he was wooden and hardly believable as a tormented man.Watch the movie for yourself, but if I had to choose over again I'd wait for the video.",Eyes Wide Shut
688,apostate,"Kubrick's last film may not be his best, but it still great",9,17 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut will be remembered as Kubrick's last film, not his greatest. But it is still a great film, none the less.  The attention to detail, mood and lighting that are the hallmark of Kubrick's work are all found here. The story itself is fascinating.  The sexuality is blatant, but with an interesting twist: the only real erotic sex is between Cruise and Kidman, all the other sex is portrayed as cold and heartless, or in effective black and white for fantasy sequences.This was a stunning, and beautiful film.  Be prepared for the unexpected. Be prepared to be shaken. This is not a film that leaves you easily.  When I saw it opening night, the entire audience was mesmerized.  They laughed out loud at some of the humorous parts, but otherwise were completely silent. In my opinion, this film did not have the gripping intensity of The Shining or Full Metal Jacket, but like all of Kubrick's films, it is an instant classic that warrants watching again and again.",Eyes Wide Shut
689,orpheus-6,The misleading nature of the hype.,8,10 September 1999,"It is Kubrick. As simple as that. What an amazing movie. A solemn memorandum for one of the greatest directors of all time. Farewell Stan, and thanx for leaving us this masterpiece.Of course this movie is not the type of work that will be accepted and worshipped generally. I remember sitting in the cinema, breath taken away by the astonishing camera work and the sound, when a young couple left the cinema, probably murmuring something like: `Let´s get out of here as quick as possible, I´m afraid this movie demands thinking.' And they were right, of course. Anyone who responds to the big ""Cruise/Kidman-1000%-Sex'-Hype with curiosity, will be disappointed. Some people even feel offended when a movie expects from the viewer the ability to think for himself in order to get what might be happening in it. Go, see Independence Day. This is not your movie.The hype around the sex scenes is a typical American thing, I guess. We´ve had it before with movies like Basic Instinct, Showgirls, Striptease or Disclosure. Americans talk about `scandalous scenes', Christians feel offended, NC-17s are given out like free buttons, and there is banning and censoring done like there is nothing else to do, while Europeans merely yawn when they see the `graphic scenes' that bombed a nation.All the hype lets some people forget, what they are dealing with. This is not a Cruise/Kidman movie. It is an ode to film making, an ode to film viewing, it is art, or again, as simple as that: It is Kubrick.",Eyes Wide Shut

By extinct, I mean that it tries to shock the viewer with scenes of strange sex, but nowadays most of the viewers have been there and have indeed done that.  If this movie were made in the sixties, I'm sure it would have caused quite a stir, but not now.As far as the pacing goes, the late Mr. Kubrick tries so hard to create tension with how the timing runs, but instead it left this viewer wanting to shout at the screen, ""Act faster!"".  The dialog was delivered slowly, endless scenes of Tom walking around the city slowly, people staring at each other for interminable amounts of time... I was literally yawning thirty minutes into the movie.The only reason to see this movie is for the beautiful naked bodies. Trust me, however, that is a very compelling reason to see it!  Nicole Kidman looks as good as I imagined she would (keep your eyes open for the two dimples on her back, worth the $7.50 right there!), and the rest of the cast were just as easy on the eyes.Overall, unless you have a burning desire to see Nicole Kidman nude 15 feet tall in front of you, wait for the video.",Eyes Wide Shut
691,wdwight,"A boring, disappointing finale to a great career.",2,27 July 1999,"My sister-in-law rates movies by how many times she looks at her watch. For me ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was a three-watcher. The movie starts abruptly with a full length shot of Nicole Kidman (Mrs. Tom Cruise) fully undressed--definitely an attention-getter. In fact, the lure of seeing the beautiful Ms. Kidman was a big reason to see the film--and ultimately also a reason not to see it. It's too late to tell Stanley Kubrick (he died earlier this year), but reality doesn't necessarily translate into art. And there is entirely too much reality in this film when it comes to seeing Kidman. We see her using the toilet then wiping herself; later she applies her deodorant and smells her armpits. What is this fascination with bathroom activities? Enough already! THIS IS NOT NECESSARY! THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINING! Additionally, we see Kidman stoned on pot and smoking cigarettes. I know this movie is intended for adult audiences, but many youths will sneak in to see it and her actions are definitely not good role modeling. Perhaps the movie's greatest fault is that it is boring. Yes, BORING! I never thought a film by Kubrick, director of such classics as ""Paths of Glory,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,""""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining"" could make a boring movie. Not only boring but pointless, ponderous, circuitous, confusing, unbelievable and stupid. By now you've guessed I didn't like it.
For years audiences have speculated about the potentially magnificent eroticism of a big-budget Hollywood porno movie with beautiful Oscar-caliber actors. Actors don't get more beautiful and handsome than Kidman and Cruise. And who better to direct such an experiment than Kubrick, whose work on ""A Clockwork Orange"" was stunning and shocking? Alas, ""Eyes"" disappoints. No eroticism and very little shock value (especially since the sexual couplings in the big orgy scene were effectively eliminated when Warner Bros. re-edited the film by placing digital actors in front of the live ones). For the life of me, I can't figure out what the heck Kubrick was doing during the unusually-long two-year shooting schedule with Cruise and Kidman. Was he rehearsing the love scenes as part of a dirty old man's fantasy (his perfectionism is legendary)? Whatever he was doing certainly didn't show up on the screen, produce great acting performances or add to his legacy.
Perhaps the fault lies with the screenplay. It provides no insight into the themes of sexual obsession and jealousy. Much of the dialogue is trite and uninspired (""OK, I'm going to be frank with you""). And the discussions between Cruise and Kidman about the nature of love and relationships fail to surpass the level of profundity found on an above-average television sitcom like ""Friends.""",Eyes Wide Shut

Tom and Nicole play a seemingly happily married couple with an extravagant life and a beautiful child; it all looks good on the surface. But a late-night argument with Nicole leads Tom to doubt the security of his marriage, sending him on an all-night mission to break his vow of monogamy.As you watch the film, nothing much appears to happen.  At times, things move excruciatingly slow. When it's all over, though, you realize what you've been watching is an illusion and that you the viewer have been through a tremendous emotional experience.Nicole Kidman, one of today's most underrated actresses, is terrific as Alice Harford, a woman hiding her feelings behind a facade of matrimonial and matriarchal bliss.  Tom Cruise, on the other hand, can't quite pull off the darkness of Bill Harford. Stanley Kubrick uses the camera like a paintbrush, creating a beautiful visual and emotional landscape.  Now if he had only realized that it's 1999 and the vast majority of the movie-going audience tires quickly of naked Playboy bunny bodies on display, this film would have more appeal.  Instead, it seems as if Kubrick was obsessed with women's breasts and rear ends...to the point that he looked for any excuse to get them into frame.",Eyes Wide Shut

I had thought the movie would build up to an interesting climax and leave me with something to remember.  But just as the big climax was supposed to happen, it fizzled!  I heard that Kubrich had rewritten the ending not long before it was finished. I don't mean to be cruel, but I thought he must have passed away during the making of it, because it just fizzled out and died somewhere in the last half.  I am so sad that this had to be Kubrich's last film, because it had so much unused potential.  I actually walked away from the theater feeling teased, like Kubrich wanted us to know just how great of a loss future film making will be without him.

696,Verbal-39,A disturbing yet brilliant look at jealousy and sexual obsession and a tribute to the greatest genius of our time.,9,27 September 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut is a true tribute to the best director of this century. After bringing us such brilliance as Paths of Glory, 2001: A Space Oddyssey, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket and The Shining, Kubrick goes all out to make his most intriguing film yet. The ""tale of jealousy and sexual obsession"" is the most fascinating piece of film I've seen since A Clockwork Orange. Kubrick spends the first moments of the film portraying the perfect lives of rich doctor Tom Cruise and his unemployed wife Nicole Kidman. Every single scene in the movie has some way of exploring our sexuality from the well orchestrated orgy scene to the apparently pointless scene where a group of boys call Cruise a faggot. After he finds out that his wife came close to having an affair, he goes for a walk through the street at night where he comes across some incidents which would change him forever. Cruise is terrific from his psychotic deep stares into space from the darkly lit back seat of his taxi to his usual overacting which actually gives this cold, disturbing, humourless tale a human side. Kidman is equally brilliant as her seductive eyes stare out of the screen defining herself and her husband as some of the finest actors of their generation. Every incident sparks with a Christamas tree and in some way explores sex. It may be  the scene in which the gay hotel receptionist flirts with Cruise or the disturbing moment where we find out the costume store owner pimps his daughter, but each scene is as disturbing, intriguing and amazingly lit as the last. Cruise's journey is portrayed in a trance-like nightmare, especially the notorius (uncut in Ireland) orgy scene which is magnificent in every sense. The cult is disturbing, frightening and dangerous (a masked woman tells Cruise to ""go now while he still can"") but also plays a large part in the movie as Cruise discovers just what goes on inside. The music is haunting and perfect whether it is the chilling solo pianist or the dizzying ""shining-esque"" trance. A scary and disturbing exploration into the sexual obsessions of humans. Watch out for the Kubrick cameo (he's sitting at a table in a restaurant). Truly a magnificent modern masterpiece which is a tribute to who is definetely the greatest genius of cinema ever.",Eyes Wide Shut
697,Ben-209,Even worse than The Shining,5,14 September 1999,"Yes, I am sad to report that the film that kept audiences waiting so long is very disappointing. The plot is quite close to that of Arthur Schnitzler's 'Traumnovelle'. However, this is a two and a half hour film based on a ninety page novella, which takes a similar time to read. Surely that is crazy? Tecnically, the film boasts all of the attributes which have made Kubrick one of THE greats. However, as with the Shining, form has taken priority over content leaving the poor viewer with a often beautiful looking but very dull film. The issues of jealousy that dominate the film are not taken to resolution in a satisfactory manner at all and the film as a whole falls apart around half way through, after a major scene which is far too long and sadly comical rather than erotic. Kubrick seems to have found something of a dilemma in taking 'Traumnovelle' to the screen. What to modernise and what to leave 'timeless'? The fantasy/erotic parts of the film are rendered somewhat silly and out-of-date in appearence. A shame that the great man's last film is his second turkey.",Eyes Wide Shut
698,petter_olsen99,One of the best films this year,8,1 October 1999,"Just because there is a lot of sex in the film does not mean that the film is ""about"" sex (or pornography, or whatever). IMNSHO EWS is ""about"" communication (or lack of it) in relationships, about the 7 year itch, about the impossible balance between saying too much and saying too little to your partner. Sex and sexual fantasies happen to be some of the most problematic areas to talk about (for some people, anyway). I remember reading an article about ""honesty in relationships"" where a panel of psychologists were given hypothetical ""should I tell my partner that .."" questions. The only all-negative recommendation was to the situation ""when we make love, I fantasize about (person)"" or similar. This, to me, is what EWS is about. It shows a couple going from slight discomfort, the ""something is wrong but I can't really put my finger on it"" feeling brilliantly portrayed at the party and just afterwards, through escalating crisis (though unrealistic and with occasional dreamlike qualities) and eventually to some sort of redemption. Some of these aspects (the important ones, for me anyway) must surely be familiar to anyone who has ever tried to make a long term relationship work, at least.The downside is that this makes EWS a very uncomfortable film to watch with your long term partner.

699,droog1983,The best film of the year!,10,5 December 1999,"As of December 5, 1999 Eyes Wide Shut is definitley the best film of the year.  Only three other films released this year have been close to it, Bringing out the Dead, The Insider, and American Beauty.
One thing that makes me angry is when people say this film is about sex. This film is definitley not about sex.  Anyone who says that either didn't see the film, or didn't understand it.  The film may deal with sexual issues, but it is not about sex.  It is about jealousy, and sexual obsession.  It is about betrayal and trust.Directed by Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest film makers ever, and starring Nicole Kidman (who should win an oscar for her portrayal) and Tom Cruise (who deserves the very least a  nomination).  Stanley Kubrick puts us on the streets of New York after hours.  We follow Cruise's character (Bill) on the streets as he is tempted and lured into a sexual world, but will Bill do it, or does he have enough faith?  This is not Kubrick's best film, but one of his finest, and definitley one of the top 10 films of the 90's.  I feel it may get cheated during Oscar time, but the movie will always stay high in my heart.God bless Stanley Kubrick.  He was truly a magnificent man.  I never met the man in my whole life, but in my short 16 year old life so far he is the closest person to me who has ever died.  And I have to say, I had a tear in my eye when I heard he past away.

700,suprmallet,A moving end to a spectacular career.,10,1 January 2000,"Considering Stanley Kubrick's track record, I was amazed to see Eyes Wide Shut garnering negative press from many distinguished sources. However, once I remembered that most of Kubrick's films initially confused and shocked most of the viewers, I could understand why people would give it negative reviews. I felt certain that the film would rise above the bad press. And when I saw the film I was vindicated. The film drew me in and didn't let go for days. Kubrick has capped off his career with one of his very best films. The script was intense and engaging, Tom Cruise was great and Nicole Kidman gave one of the most moving monologues I've seen in a movie. I think one reason the film got bad press was because the highly toted sex in the film is very slight, most of it was shown in the trailers. This is not a sex film, it is a film about sex and fidelity and how these actions and ideas intertwine and create emotions, often highly irrational emotions, within people. One of the most incredible aspects of the film is the way the plot really does draw you in, whether you know it or not. By the time I got to the ""New York Underground Orgy"" scene which was so controversial, I was so engrossed in the plot that the sex did not get a reaction out of me, and that is a big achievement. Overall, Eyes Wide Shut is one of Kubrick's best films, with incredible acting, amazing directing, and a storyline and dialogue that should, and probably will, be taught in film schools.",Eyes Wide Shut
701,suprmallet,It just has a certain something,10,9 August 2000,"As an aspiring filmmaker, I've often dissected movies to see what makes them great. Other times I'll watch a movie, know that it's great, but can't form a sentence to say why I have such thoughts. Eyes Wide Shut is one of those movies where I can both dissect it and other times I can just let it move me. And since I've already written a cerebral review before, I'll stick to the emotions for this one.I think the fact that of any movie I've ever reviewed this movie alone has made me want to make two separate reviews tells me something about the power it has. I could go on for hours about what I thought made it great, but I already did that in the other review. I wrote that review after seeing the movie once. Here is how I felt after seeing it twice:Thank god for directors like Kubrick. I was so glad to see a movie that had a different pacing than most movies today. The movie took its time to unfold and in the end, even if every single incident isn't examined, it helps to create atmosphere. It helped draw me into the film. The vivid imagery and odd happenings were then more acceptable. I viewed certain events with humor, with apprehension, with interest, but never with disbelief.The acting was dead-on target. I think Kidman deserved an academy award simply for her speech about infidelity. She also plays an inebriated woman quite well. Too bad her role became smaller as Cruise's got bigger. And Cruise was perfect as a normally rational man who internalizes his feelings and is suddenly given information that he does not know how to deal with. He made me believe that what he was going through was genuine and often quite painful.And, in the end, I think I really love this movie because when I see it I get a feeling deep in my gut. This feeling can't be explained, but I get the feeling when I watch something that is, in my opinion, a truly great piece of cinema. It's that feeling that inspires me. It's what makes me aspire to be a filmmaker.

702,darkangel_5,"sphincter wired shut... bloody awful ""movie"" if you want to call it that.",1,15 February 2000,"This movie *deep breath*, where to start... Ok. It is probably the worst movie I have seen in the theater, ever.I see a LOT of movies. I enjoy watching every other Kubric movie. This thing I did not. How horrible. Lets see:NO plot. None. Not anywhere to be found. If you read the taglines maybe you'll see some ephemeral something somewhere. Detestable main characters. No suspense. Cinematography I sincerely believe was done by Kubric's corpse or something.The centerline wavered so badly in one scene (when whiny-boy was lumbering along the street towards his one evil brush with a group of homophobic college kids milling about an empty street) that I'm sure it was Kubric-corpse holding the camera.The soundtrack got on my nerves, badly. That one fingered drunken casio-piano noise really got under my skin.Every time they built up ANY kind of suspense... they killed it dead. The sex-club was a HUGE joke. I really don't think anyone thinks that tame-ol-thing was risque. (I hope.) We are supposed to feel sorry for Pretty-whiny-rich-boy whose solution to problems = shelling out $100 bills from his wallet. Oooooh. Damn. I wish I could have his problems. And I wish I could be the drooling guy that could swagger up to Nicole Kidman and guzzle her drink and spout such cool lines as (paraphrased) ""Yes, I know it was your drink."" If he were coming onto my wife, I'd laugh so hard I'd probably keel over dead. And the scene drug on and on and on... ad nauseum.I sat stunned after the movie was over... then applauded. It was so damned bad that not one person in the theatre had the audacity to even give me a sharp look. How could they? I'm sure they read the ""enlightened"" reviews of just how ""deep and neat"" Kubric's last film could be.If you were to happen upon a copy for free somewhere (some luckless shlep bought it and is trying to give it away before friends and family see it) do yourself a favor... watch the first couple of minutes to see Nicole's touche. Fast forward to see her get fondled a couple of times. Find the scene where Poor-Richie falls flacid when confronted with an ultra-beautiful woman that wants to have sex with him. Laugh at him. Oggle her. She is the most beautiful creature in the film. Then give the movie a quick flip into the garbage can. There really is nothing to see.Manos, Hands of Fate has it beat on all fronts.Now, you will hear the pseudo sub-intellectual crowd that hangs out in front of Borders trying to tell you that it had deep meaning. So does my belly button. But my belly button does have better cinematography. I could take a polaroid. It'd eclipse anything in THAT film. However, while my stomach is much more interesting than this film, I'd never submit to such seemingly endless torture for it either.That being said, if you want to watch it, go ahead. Just don't have any expectations. In fact, watch it with a date. He/She'll be so bored that watching plants grow would be entertaining. If you can't strike up a conversation during this movie... give it up.",Eyes Wide Shut
703,rgreen7360,"Lessen Nicole Kidman's role, and this would've been great.",6,31 August 2000,"This film seemed to be composed of two parts. The first had Nicole Kidman seemingly in the picture simply for eye candy. The second, much more interesting storyline had Tom Cruise, and the mystery of the house. Trim Nicole Kidman's part drastically, or better yet cut her out of the film entirely, and this film has the potential to be great. Not to mention it would have been a much needed forty-five minutes shorter. The scenes in the house, while strong for some viewers, is not actually as scandalous as I was expecting from what I'd heard through word of mouth. In fact the only parts of the movie which were offensive to me where the dream sequences which featured Nicole Kidman and the nameless sailor. I found myself wondering what caused her to make such a poor choice in career judgement. The party at the beginning in which she danced with the Hungarian, was uneccessary, and entirely too long. Cut the whole thing. Make Tom Cruise single, or at least make his married life not quite so drawn out, maybe even give Nicole Kidman some intelligent, brief dialogue to deliver, and this would have been in the eight or nine category, instead of a slightly above average 6, for a good idea, which was off by one performance.",Eyes Wide Shut

Like one guy in here said ""It's exploration into a married couple's relationship, and how sex plays a major role in their union, is quite fascinating"" Really??

It had the usual weird and wonderful hallmarks of a Kubrick film.I enjoyed the minimalist style music, which accompanied the action, along with the more scene specific stuff (don't want to say more for fear of spoiling). In my view the film was about long term relationships: how jealousy can create insecurities; which can lead people to play dangerous games in order to redress the balance.Unfortunately, after a good start and a good build up of tension, this film simply stopped rather than ended. What a shame! The way in which the finishing scenes lacked some special ingredient makes me question whether Kubrick was still around in the final moments of the film's production.The film could have done with being several minutes longer, so that the points it made could have been delivered more slowly allowing the tension to be ease off less abruptly.",Eyes Wide Shut

The plot, what there is of it, is tedious. The acting is awful, which can't really be blamed on Kidman and Cruise, who didn't have much to work with, in the first place. The outdoor scenes look about as much as new York City as those back-lot NYC scenes you see on Seinfeld.

In amazing performances by former couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, both show and represent very well two difficult characters: a married couple who, at first sight, seem very happy, but in the reality are very complicated people. Vast subjects such as sexual obsession, jealousy, desperation, and life frustration are geniously exposed in the movie. After Alice (Kidman) confesses her husband Doctor Bill (Cruise) than once she was tempted to cheat on him, he enters in a confusing and messing odyssey where he tries to seek revenge.

712,sammyfatkitty,Eyes Wide Shut Review,8,14 August 2011,"Eyes Wide Shut is a tense and creepy psycho-sexual thriller, that unfortunately is ultimately a disappointing experience. However, this is still a well acted and well directed film with a genuinely disturbing feel to it. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise), and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman), are members of New York City's upper circle high-class society. Their relationship is going strong, until Alice recalls an event that happened while the family was on vacation, in which she thought about having an affair with a naval officer. The idea that his wife even considered such a thing makes Bill jealous and angry, so he decides to take things one step further and sets out to have a real affair of his own. Nicole Kidman is as good as ever in this film, but unfortunately you don't see much of her, as the story is centered around Tom Cruise's character, his night long escapade, and the resulting events. Tom Cruise does a fine job of playing the obsessed and hurt husband, who has blown his wife's fantasy entirely out of proportion in his mind, making it something much more unforgivable than it really was. You really feel bad for him, especially since his wife has hurt him so badly, and no matter how much he wants to get back at her, he can't seem to bring himself to do it. The direction is also fantastic. Kubrick gives the movie a very creepy feel, especially during the intense middle section. The way the movie is shot is great, and the musical score really adds to the overall effect. While both the acting and the direction were very good as expected, this movie isn't a classic for me because of the ending. This story of revenge and emotional as well as sexual fulfillment is very fascinating and quite original. It also builds up a huge amount of tension. Unfortunately, with so much set up and so many directions in which the movie could go, the movie just sort of fell flat towards the climax. There was no great twist at the end, and the story didn't tie itself together in an exciting way. The creepy atmosphere and the sense of true danger that the movie had built up was completely forgotten within the last 15 minutes. I was expecting the couple to realize that they had both made mistakes and forgive each other, as they did, but I also expected something extremely intense to happen beforehand. Overall, this movie features good acting and exceptional direction, but unfortunately it's extremely slowly paced and the story falls completely flat by the end. It's hard to even call the end a ""climax"" because not much happens at all. However I can still recommend at least a few viewings of this film, if only for the incredibly intense first 2 hours.",Eyes Wide Shut
713,aldo-976-200911,Does not look like Kubrick,3,5 December 2014,"I love Stanley Kubrick. All of what I have seen is in the top list of my preferred movies. Nothing is less than 9/10. However, this one does not even look a Kubrick movie. It is Kubrick in the scenery, in the photography, the lights ... But the story, that's not Kubrick at all. Well, I understand that to direct Tom Cruise, who is as expressive as a sole fish, and make an actor out of him, is far beyond human capability. Nicole Kidman is just a little better. I suppose the production imposed to the poor director the gossip couple of the moment. There are rumors about this, and this can explain many things. But, apart the actors, the story is just stupid, the (in)famous orgy scene is just ridiculous, boredom is coming to a point that I totally missed the ending. I was there, but my mind was wandering on more interesting things. It's a pity that Stanley Kubrick spoiled his career of a genius with this last one.",Eyes Wide Shut
714,Ben_hanson111,"Unique, truly extraordinary",10,26 September 2005,"This is one of my favourite films. I love the tense and psychological atmosphere throughout and every scene was fascinating in its own way. This film was not meant to be particularly sexy as many viewers were expecting. Kubrick would not have allowed it to be marketed in such a way. Many of the characters Bill meets are purely symbolic so people should not complain that they are implausible or caricatured. I would not argue with people who complain of the film's slow pace but it didn't bother me personally. Brief outline: The first part of the film sets the scene and introduces the main characters: Bill and Alice, Nick Nightingale and Ziegler. Bill and Alice's marital situation becomes clear and then her confession sets off a chain of events forming the main subject of the film. Bill has several near sexual encounters with various strangers before Nightingale points him to the mysterious masked orgy at the mansion. I found this to be one of the most sinister and haunting scenes in movie history. Bill discovers that this society is extremely private and that intruders are dealt with severely. He is spared after a woman at the orgy appears to sacrifice herself.During the rest of the film Bill struggles to come to terms with what he has seen and remains curious, especially of what became of Nick. The film retains a strong element of mystery and only ever shows what Bill sees. Ziegler, revealed as a member of the orgy attempts to explain things to Bill and reassure him that nothing sinister went on. Can he be believed? I loved the way the film was shot and the sets were exceptional. All the characters were perfect for their role in the film and the mystery kept me interested throughout. This is a serious film but everything that happens shouldn't be taken at face value. There are many things that aren't explained and seem implausible. e.g The mask appearing on the pillow. It is not made clear that the events are imagined but they are often symbolic and should be taken allegorically. Eyes Wide Shut is flawed, the mystery could have been resolved better, perhaps with Ziegler's explanation being discredited. It remains a great film because its the brilliance that went before that sticks in the mind.",Eyes Wide Shut

719,rahulrajchukkath,Most Underrated Film of Kubrick?,9,3 September 2019,"Kubrick left leaving everything what he had acquired here. 400 days of Eyes Wide Shut made it a masterpiece of Kubrick which we should rank aside with 2001, shining etc. A hypnotic and dreamy narration adds crisp long shots and dedicated music with brilliant acting are more than enough to immerse into this classic.Sexually explicit scenes might be the reason which made people conclude this is an erotic film which exactly isn't. While erotica barely an essence of the plot, there is more intricate paradox of commitment the film deals with. Conflict starts from an argument of Bill and Alice revealing their misconceptions on marriage making an epiphany both to us and the leads. Then begins the dreamy travel through the city which ends up in a more eerie atmosphere of a ritual orgy. Eventually leads us to a realisation how much layered its plot is. The very climax scenes unfolds before us, both dream and truth are mutually upside-down.Along with the master cinematography, Jocelyn Pook's hand-picked music scores adds to the complexity and the mystery. A noteworthy Tamil song with a Carnatic music intensify the extremity of strangeness of the orgy scene. Also, happy hear that in a film like this. I do notice how gorgeous Tom Cruise as well as Kidman as the film demands the necessity of their beauty.Eyes Wide Shut easily becomes my second favorite Kubrick film after The Shining.",Eyes Wide Shut
720,Yankee-3,Gripping,8,21 July 1999,"It's not really a movie you enjoy;  it's more a movie you experience.First of all, it definitely should have been NC-17, with or without the digital figures blocking out all the serious sexual activity. The orgy scene is still incredibly adult, and it is still clear what is going on. Parents who take their kids to it are out of their minds.The acting, directing, and other production values are excellent. Cruise has less emoting to do than Kidman, so it is a little easier to notice her performance, but his is remarkable in its own, subtle way. I've never seen a Kubrick movie before, but I understand he has a history of using long shots and pauses to achieve creepiness, and this is no exception. Color, music, and even extras are all used to emotional effect. For instance, fewer and fewer extras on the city streets as the movie continues and Bill finds fewer and fewer of the people he encounters are so innocent as they seem.As for the plot, well, I can't exactly say I liked it, because that would imply the movie was a cheerful experience, and it was not. However, I did find it gripping and well-executed up until the end, at which point Sidney Pollack's character explained too much. It would have been better for him to throw Tom a few cryptic lines, leaving him and the intelligent viewer to figure it out for themselves. I already knew everything Sid said in that scene--the only real revelation he provided had more to do with Tom's response to everything. All in all, though, there was much humor, plenty of nice touches, and even a few understated running jokes.
I think the bottom line is whether the themes and their depiction work for you or not. They worked for me. The movie reminded me of the Hawthorne story ""Young Goodman Brown"" with a few touches of ""Caligula"" thrown in. I spent $8.50 to see it and I don't feel shafted--what more can one say?",Eyes Wide Shut

Missing here are the all too common jarring transitions of scene.Unfortunately, also missing here is anything to make the viewer care for any of the characters.  Motivations, and especially depth, are nearly completely absent from any of the players.  Myriad possible themes are opened.. with few explored much.. and with no conclusions offered.  No, we do not want a film to spoon feed us a conclusion.. but this film makes no comment, and leaves its explorations so vague as to leave the viewer uncertain even in which directions to contemplate.If you are in the mood for a visually sumptuous film, and are prepared to find no other content, then consider this film.

There wasn't as much fanfare on this one as on Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, but ask any dedicated movie fan, and they'll tell you this is the one we've been waiting for a whole decade.  Was it worth the wait?The answer is an astounding yes.  To reveal any of the film's circumstance would be criminal.  To say the least, the trailers and television commercials give away nothing.  Everything you've read in the press beforehand - about Cruise in a dress, Kidman fully nude, the two of them having explicit sex and using exotic drugs - that's all nonsense.  The film doesn't stray anywhere near pornographic, and the digital masking used to hide some of the sexual activity is the biggest joke I've ever heard from the MPAA.  I thought South Park nearly getting an NC-17 would take the cake. But I was wrong.  Fortunately, the digital masking was prepared by Kubrick, so you're not seeing something unfaithful to his vision, and the message still remains intact.  Nothing is lost in it, but I'm sure a few right wing people who believe that sex and language will destroy mankind, but think that guns are harmless, will probably sleep better tonight.  But I'll be up thinking about every little subtle thing in this film, and what a genius Kubrick was.  I'm sure he died and became the Starchild, from his masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey.Kubrick said before his death that this was, in his opinion, his best film ever.

Kubrick left us with a triumphant, brilliant, provocative movie deserving not only high praise, but serious, ruminative thought by all those who see it.There are other fine films with excellent acting, strong scripts and magnificent direction which cannot raise in me the ardor of ""Eyes."" It is the manifold layered complexity of this movie, the interwoven nuance, which I find so compelling.The title ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not only a telling description of the protagonists' condition - it is also a taunt to moviegoers too meek or superficially inclined to open their irises and observe what is really going in this film.The movie begins in the cut-and-dry, black and white world of ""reality"" (which is really just an idealized dream) and progresses into the many-hued surreality of what is, in actuality, reality (hmmm). Directing one's attention to Kubrick's use of the colors red and blue (and the rainbow interposed betwixt these spectral limits) yields important clues to the film's content.When Bill enters the rainbow (escorted into it by those catty red and blue cloaked models) he begins, slowly by slowly, to open his eyes. Things are no longer what they seem. His close friend reveals himself to be a wanton profligate, a beautiful woman, in a state of drug-induced catatonia, seems endeavored to pursue her own destruction, and his own wife of nine years admits to being beset by a gnawing extramarital desire.Frightened and somewhat naive, Bill bumbles and stumbles into the rainbow. Here begins to see clearly, for the first time, death, destruction, evil and the superposition of ironic extremes - in other words the chromatic dissonance of human reality.Through the misadventures of everyman Bill Harford, Kubrick's dazzlingly rendered rainbow challenges viewers to unmask and examine their own obscured  desires, and through this process, to keep their eyes wide open.",Eyes Wide Shut

It was definitely the worst Kubrick film.It's hard to imagine a film with this many beautiful women in it (especially Nicole Kidman) as being a waste of time, but it is.  The plot could be accomplished in about 30 minutes if all of the meaningless things had been left out.  You can skip the first half-hour and not be lost at all in the story.  The entire segment with the costume store clerk adds NOTHING to the plot of the movie.  What's more, all of the dialog and action feels like your watching the movie in slow motion.  (Hit your FF button and you'll notice that most characters appear to be moving at normal speed!)  Lead characters do not seem to change at all through out the film.  They react to things in one way, then, when those things change, the characters are still reacting the same way, as if the changes had not occurred.The worst part?  The story is completely anti-climactic!  Do sit waiting the ending that will make all the convoluted items come together because you're not going to get one.The most annoying part for me was this nasty habit that all the characters seemed to have:  One character would say a line, only to have it immediately repeated, as a question, by the other character.  Example: Character one says: ""You can't do that!""  Character two says: ""I can't do that?""  This little bit of abrasion occurs about 1000 times in an already exasperating film.

732,MarcelQ,Absolutely terrifying and wonderful.,7,17 July 1999,"Stanley Kubrick has left us with a beautiful uncompromising final film. It is disturbingly beautiful, leaves no answers, and leaves your mouth gaping open from the the jaw dropping first glimpse to the credits.  I saw it yesterday afternoon, and a day later I can't stop thinking about it. The performance by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are their best ever, the visuals are amazing, the story was sublime, but unfortunately, it is not destined for mainstream acceptance.  As I was leaving the theater, I could hear one one woman say, ""Two years wait for this, we should have seen Notting Hill."", Her husband replied, ""The best part was the credits.""  The only flaw in 'Eyes Wide Shut' shouldn't be a flaw isn't Kubrick's fault at all.  People don't want to think they want to be told what they think.  That is the most tragic thing of all.",Eyes Wide Shut

The use of light and color is particularly amazing, the cinematography was dazzling, and the directing was nothing short of genius. The dialogue was tense and very spare -- but purposefully so, The same goes for the film's score. It is a brilliant piece of existential storytelling, and it is a shame that this will be Kubrick's last. But, oh what a way to go out!",Eyes Wide Shut

Despite the fact that some people call this movie disgusting and weird, I would just have to say that they haven't reached the level of maturity in movie viewing to be able to see Stanley Kubrik's genius. Not only is this film strong in conveying an interesting point but it is also highly entertaining to watch. Like all of Kubrik's films, Eyes Wide Shut opens the door to a new universe of understanding a subject, which in this case is sex. Every moment of the movie is filled with colorful themes that branch from that one part of our mentality concerned with love, affection, and last but not least lust. Kubrik presents the viewer with a variety of different sexual preferences and in the background shows how people, sometimes unknowingly, exhibit them through their behavior. At this point it should be mentioned that if you are viewer who is concerned about stuff like strong sexual content, nudity, etc., you should make an exception to see this movie in any case. Because although the MPAA does describe Eyes Wide Shut with these exact words, Kubrik simply used theses themes to deliver a more direct and powerful message (in which he highly succeeded). So in conclusion I highly recommend that you see this film, because it's one that you don't want to miss.",Eyes Wide Shut

The trip is a fun one, full of suspense and mystery, but if you are anything like me, you will find yourself wondering why Tom Cruise has trouble reciting lines that are scripted. Sexual lust, always a hot topic, is a part of this movie, but it is story about beauty. The obsession of beauty is throughout the film, as rarely will you find a person disfigured or a physique too flabby.

Even if the subject, Woody Allen's kind of ""canvas"", didn't fascinate me (the foundations of sex and marital relations, completely revisited by Kubrick's unique point of view), I must say that the quality is there. It is mostly a cinephilic pleasure. My experience with Kubrick's movies taught me to be extremely alert to what is shown and said on the screen, because you'll never know what you could suddenly understand retroactively about his work. Kubrick was and still is one of the greatest directors and each of his premieres are quite an event.An advise for all you puritans out there :EYES WIDE SHUT (R, 159 minutes) -- Contains nudity, sexual scenes,marijuana smoking, alcohol drinking and obscenity.

What a loss he is to the world of cinema. It is two and a half hours of the most fascinating, absorbing cinema since David Cronenberg's CRASH. Both films deal with the many facets of human sexuality; Kubrick's film is 'warm' and may just have a happy ending whereas Cronenberg's film is most definitely 'cold' with nothing resolved before the final credits. Nicole Kidman's performance is excellent but it is Tom Cruise that carries the film; his 'Mr. Lost' character more akin to that of Jeff Bridges' characters in AGAINST ALL ODDS, THE FISHER KING and FEARLESS.

I loved the music, it tied the piece together. I have nothing bad to say about this movie. The actors were good for who they were, the story was good.

I had heard some bad reviews, but generally speaking, I tend to enjoy movies that are different, so we got it. Besides, we thought, there will be Tom Cruise nudity - what could it hurt? It could hurt a lot - and believe me it was painful. I think this movie must have been about 7 hours long. We knew 30 minutes into the movie that it sucked, BUT, we still had to watch the other 5 or 6 hours, because there's the Tommy Nude Shot to look for  - right? (If you've seen the movie, you know how well that theory turns out.) I was quite surprised at how tame it was. I had heard all this talk about how it bordered on pornography, but to me all it was was nudity. Lots of naked women - big deal.

A lot of people were disappointed by the cold nature of nudity and sex, so i assume everyone wanted to be aroused by this film. I did not find it arousing, but this does not detract from it's beauty! This was the first Kubrik film i saw and i think to dismiss it is disrespectful to his genius! The use of light, fantastic music, the way he captures the performances and our attention is brilliant. Nicole Kidman is stunning, she steals the film with her chilling speeches. Cruise is good too, but with a straighter role. The supporting cast are great: Alan Cumming is so funny! It is very long and slow, but i was never once bored as Kubrik always has an aspect about each moment that is fascinating - the time flew by. The story line and dialogue is thin, as in most of the kubrik films ive seen: this is done in order for us to observe the characters, scene and shot more closely. The one thing that a female friend had a complaint about was the lack of male nudity, where Kidman gets her clothes off as much as possible, cruise only ever strips down to his underwear. BUT i think this is done in order to frustrate the audience, as i think Kubrik is commenting on the unfairness of sex. Be warned, this film is not for everyone. It is for an audience that enjoy challenging films and are willing to learn more about one of the greatest directors of all time.",Eyes Wide Shut
748,jawmo,"Very fine, but flawed, valedictory from a legend",8,27 November 2012,"Being a life-long Kubrick fan, I had very high hopes for this, his final film. And it did not surprise me that after the first viewing, I honestly didn't like it very much. (This is often the case with Kubrick's movies.) Yes, it has the classic Kubrick flourishes -- elegant, even lush, cinematography, musical refrains that stick in the brain like cockle-burrs, delightfully off-beat characters that you just don't see in other films -- but there was still something, well, missing.Kubrick has always (at least since ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and excluding ""The Shining"") taken chances with casting. For ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" he used two fairly obscure actors named Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood; later choices included Malcolm McDowell, Ryan O'Neill, Marisa Berenson and Matthew Modine. They all worked (some would disagree) because Kubrick basically broke them down and molded them to suit his vision of the performance. But ""Eyes Wide Shut"" departs from the practice, employing Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, two of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the time. I understand the rationale -- Cruise and Kidman were married, though they'd split soon after ""EWS"" was released, theoretically creating a more believable pairing for Bill and Alice Harford. But Kubrick has never let such matters as star power or compatibility influence his choice of actors before ... why now? Was it because ""EWS"" is such a strange, potentially scandalous movie that Kubrick feared no one would see it otherwise? This seems unlikely for the director of ""Lolita"" and ""A Clockwork Orange."" Whatever Kubrick's rationale, Cruise and Kidman simply don't work in these roles. I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, though I've liked him in certain roles. He just doesn't have the chops for a role this challenging. Kidman is a fine actress, but she comes off as flighty, shrill, angry and submissive by turns; there is no real emotional center to her character, and perhaps no actress could give her one.The story itself is straightforward enough when you remember the source material: ""Traumnovelle,"" or dream story. Where in the story the dream begins is the question. I think it is when Bill comes home to find Alice dreaming; she wakes up, he falls asleep. There are other clues, such as the costume shop, which has been reconfigured when Bill returns his cowl the day after the party. Also, note how in the first half of the movie, women come on to Bill; in the second half it's the other way 'round (without success). I also have a theory that the movie is essentially Kubrick's second crack at Joyce's ""Ulysses"" (""2001"" being the first), but I'll leave it at that.Such notions only come with repeat viewings. This is the ONLY way to experience a Kubrick film. I've never liked his movies as much the first time as I did the second or third. He packs too much information into every frame for my brain to apprehend it all.",Eyes Wide Shut
749,juancorrea503,Misunderstood,10,2 March 2011,"I think Eyes Wide Shut is highly misunderstood. The movie is wrapped in symbolism, which I don't think a lot of people, looking to see a blockbuster with Tom and Nicole, really understood.Eyes Wide Shut is about social status and the power that comes with it. The movie uses secret societies, paganism with the winter solstice to tell its story. Every prop, color that has been chosen, every human interaction is done deliberately by Krubrikc to tell the story, which is why he is a master at his art.The Christmas Tree, the color purple and gold, animal print all represent fertility. Alice is resentful for her husbands social status and longs to be an animal that ""fucks."" The best thing about this movie is that it provokes more mysteries and questions than it feeds our curiosity. For example, when they are having the orgy we don't really get to focus too much on what's really going on and we always peer into to other rooms getting only a small taste of what's going on.This movie is--like I said--about social status, human sexuality (we are only animals who our real purpose is to ""fuck"")and of course secret societies, which provokes the question: are we just living as pawns to feed the interest of the social elite's twisted games?This movie is extremely deep, and at times, I wish it had more to satisfy my curiosity, but that was Krubrick's intention.",Eyes Wide Shut

Nicole Kidman says (The quote isn't accurate)""Well, the important thing is that now we are awake"". This one-line quote provokes many thoughts and motivates great imaginary. It is very hard to express why I adore this film so much. I mean, I know that I love this film so much but I can't just tell what point fascinated me.

751,pbk2010,Must watch this esoteric film with eyes wide OPEN.,8,12 February 2018,"In the film, Dr. Bill (Tom Cruise) is a married doctor in an upper class neighborhood in New York. When Dr. Bill finds out from his wife (at the time, his real-life wife, Nicole Kidman) that she's considered cheating on him, he embarks on a strange journey of encounters throughout the night that takes him to the decadent underworld of the rich and famous.At a jazz club at closing, he meets an old friend from medical school, Nick. Now a jazz piano player, Nick tells him about a party he will be playing the piano for later, but he must play totally blind because of the debauchery that takes place there. All of the people wear long hooded cloaks with Venetian masks, so Cruise ends up renting out a similar costume and takes a taxi to a Hellfire mansion out in the country where Nick will be performing. Hellfire Clubs are meeting places of persons of high quality (politicians, Hollywood executives, etc) who want to take part in extremely immoral acts. Their activities included mock religious ceremonies, devil worship, and occult rituals.The music in the movie changes drastically when Cruise arrives at the Hellfire mansion. Right after Cruise enters this mansion, the very odd song heard in the background is called ""Backwards Priests"" and features Romanian Orthodox Divine Liturgy played backward. The reversal or inversion of sacred objects is typical of black magic and satanic rituals. By having this Christian liturgy played backward right before widespread fornication, it's a way of stating that the ""elite of the world"" is nothing less than satanic!Although none of this is actually mentioned in Eyes Wide Shut, the entire movie can be interpreted as one big ""magick sex"" journey, characterized by a back-and-forth between opposing forces: life and death - pleasure and pain - male and female - light and darkness!

Wooden performances. Pretentious dialog. You name it, this big-budget gobbles almost as furiously as I laughed at it.The scene where Cruise wanders through the secret ""orgy"" is the most embarrassing scene I've ever sat through in a film.

But I think that is part of the point Stanley Kubrick intended to make.The acting is not perfect but it's very good. I would say it's the best movie Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman ever did. Sidney Pollack is great as the rich, self-centred man.It's a mystery that's really about love and how relationships last and survive, and ""what really matters.""I don't want to spoil anything but visually it's quite stunning as any Kubrick movie is, and I'd point out that this was his favourite film of all the ones he directed so that should be worth something right? :)",Eyes Wide Shut
754,laurieweston-55004,Stanley Kubrick's last film is a strange one,10,7 September 2015,"Out of all of Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is arguably the most decisive. Some say it's a work of art on par with 2001, others say it's just glorified porn. And at first glance, I can see why people would think that. But give it a closer look, and I think it will surprise you.A doctor called Will living in New York (played by Tom Cruise) discovers his wife (played by Nicole Kidman) had a fantasy about having an affair with a sailor. Understandably angry about this, he leaves to try and gain his own attraction for another woman to get back at her. He eventually gets into a strange sexual cult who discover him and plan to do god knows what to him, but he's saved by a women he saved earlier that day. The cult let him go, but he remains suspicious that they're following him around.The film is absolutely gorgeous. Kubrick films are well known for being shot like a work of art, but this film takes to a whole new level. It has a very dreamlike look and feel to everything. The colors are hazy and blurry, like when you're feeling tired. Cruise gives a great performance as Will. He manages to sell that this man is feeling betrayed, confused, and even jealous that his wife has these thoughts in her head. Kidman is pretty good as well.The masked ball scene is easily the highlight of the film. Not because it's erotic, though it certainly is that, but for another reason. Going back to dreams, it feels like something right out of a nightmare. The masks are extremely creepy, as they just stare endlessly. The music is beyond creepy. It sounds otherworldly and just shakes you're nerves effortlessly.On a side note, have you ever noticed that Kubrick films usually have two distinct halves to them? As in, the story normally makes a big shift halfway into the film. Eyes Wide Shut does something similar. I won't tell you exactly what, but pay attention to the world before and after the masked ball scene, and you'll see what I mean.I can see why some may be turned off by this film due it's rather 'adult' content, but it's still a masterpiece of film. It is very long, so make sure you have plenty of time, and be sure to let everything sink in.",Eyes Wide Shut
755,nickfaskmail,"Masterpiece, but under one condition...",9,16 April 2020,"I loved this movie. The actors, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, are great. As for the scenario, the only way to really see the movie is to understand it. It's not just a simple plot, some things that happen during a strange night. Stanley Kubrick focuses on specific social messages (and some other messages too that maybe aren't so specific and have to be interpreted). My advice is that after you finish watching the movie, just sit and think about it. Try to pay attention to details. There are also some very helpful video on YouTube explaining the plot and some interesting material that you can read online. In any case, you can't appreciate the movie if you don't realize what the hidden meaning of the plot is.",Eyes Wide Shut
756,betc,Disappointing,5,19 July 1999,"Although I consider myself a Kubric fan, I was disappointed in this film. The catalyst for the plot is Nicole's character's admission that she was tempted not just to cheat on her husband, but also to give up her marriage and child for just one night with some guy she never even had a conversation with.  Give me a break!  Since Nicole's character is not a total flake, I had a major problem believing this.  I also thought the plot was overly moralistic and misogynistic.  Women who indulge in promiscuous sex are severely punished while men are not (the Sydney Pollack character).  There is excessive female nudity, while Tom rarely takes off his over-coat. There are many nude scenes of Nicole, and when she's not naked, she's frequently clad in just her underwear.  The orgy scene was ridiculous with the digitized cover-ups.  This movie dragged on in what seemed like real time. On the plus side, I loved the look of the film, as well as the cinematography and use of light.  Tom was perfectly cast.",Eyes Wide Shut
757,Volvican,The emperor has no clothes,2,5 April 2009,"Reading other user reviews it would seem that a favourite line is that EWS is supposed 'to make the viewer think'. Let me decode that line for you. It simply means that the movie, especially in terms of character, makes no sense whatsoever, so you are left wondering what in the world these people were doing. So yes. I thought. I thought, 'Wow - this is an incredibly bad film.' Again, reading other reviews, I am confronted with the idea that perhaps Doctor Bill's wanderings through NYC are really just some kind of dream or fantasy sequence. I don't know where this idea came from - perhaps the book itself but I can definitely say that it DOESN'T come from the film. There is nothing to suggest that you are in a dream or fantasy world - it is played straight. And because of this it fails miserably because neither character, but especially Cruise's, acts in a manner that follows normal human behaviour.SPOILER ALERT Bill states quite clearly in the argument between he and his wife that he is not a jealous person. Nothing is particularly shocking about Alice's admittance that she wanted to have adulterous sex with a Naval officer that would suddenly cause this to change in Bill. And yet suddenly we now see Bill obsessing over the image of his wife engaging in adultery in his mind, and at this point the whole movie loses the plot. We see a grieving daughter that hardly knows him profess her undying love to him. Who knows why. He then decides to visit a prostitute - only to not go through with it when his wife calls, even though there is no indication of the relief of an escaped mistake. Despite this ' I can't cheat on my wife' moment - he then suddenly becomes incredibly curious about his piano friend's secret gig - that he goes to an awful lot of trouble to steal into the event to see for himself. Why? It just wouldn't have happened. Bill's character is not that sexual driven - he not that sexual compelled - hence him not having sex with the prostitute. He wouldn't have gone there. And when he did get there- he certainly would have gone running at the first sign of trouble - i.e., the masked woman telling him to get out of there.I could go on and on about these strange behavioural choices. And I understand true 'tragedy' where a character is compelled by their character to follow their seeming fate through to a destructive conclusion - but there were no signs of destruction in Cruise's character - nor was there a fatal and destructive end. So it was all pretty pointless. Add to it an incredibly trite ending in a toy store where the moral of the story is 'we need to f**k.' If that sounds bad- let me assure you - it really really is.In terms of sexual matters - overt and subtle and the machinations of sexual desire - David Lynch captures more truth in a single surreal scene in almost any of his movies than this one does in almost three hours. I don't really think Kubrick and sex go together at all.",Eyes Wide Shut

The fact that he'd be staring with his wife as husband and wife made this film even more attractive to me.  This being a vision of Stanley Kubrick; the visuals are at sometimes dreamlike and and at other times, utterly chilling.  Tom's performance is very convincing; adapting to his wife's actions and then later to the aftermath of his own actions.  Mrs. Tom Cruise, er, Nicole Kidman also does a fine job switching between the variences of her character (Wife-mode, Mother-mode, & Bitch-mode).  You'd swear she was playing different characters throught the film and not the same one.  In an all-too-brief, yet very revealing role, Leelee Sobieski give a dazzling performance as a obviously underage girl whom by circumstances Tom's character runs into.  Her character is one that is very sexually uninhibited and extroverted, even to the point of making a profit of her body with it, all with the gentle blessings of her father.  Yes, her father.  A final note on Leelee:  She looked damn hot bouncing around the screen in her flimsy little bra and panties.  With that said, I cannot have more respect for her performance.  She was supposed to give that effect.  The movie was, for me, disturbing at times as it dealt with the subject of infidelity and it's consequences in a couple's relationship.  I certainly would not recommend this as a date movie, unless you're in the mood for a never-ending discussion/fight afterwards.  It's good for what it is; a drama dealing with some very edgy aspects of being a couple and the extremes one may be lead to if give up caring what happens to yourself.",Eyes Wide Shut
760,Vortex-6,"A bad, annoying, nearly 3 hour episode of All My Children.",1,18 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut is a shallow, appalling mess of a film which will no doubt be hailed as high art by the baby boom crowd. I suppose this sort of thing is what white bread America, particularly the repressed crowd I saw it with, imagines to be avant garde. Some phrases I heard from those around me in the theater: ""I can't believe we're going to see this!"" ""This is too weird!"" ""Is that marijuana?"" ""Is she a prostitute?"" ""Oh, she isn't worthy of him!"" ""Thank God he didn't have sex with her!"" ""Oh, look. That's a nice apartment."" Please. I've had racier things go on in my car than any of the sex or so-called orgy scenes in this film, and yet it was giving the fat, status-obsessed yuppies around me a case of the vapors. Eyes wide shut, indeed. An endless, overwrought, melodramatic morality play about sex and guilt. Nothing more. Imagine being taken on a tour of Studio 54 in its heyday while being flogged by a nun. The women in this film ranged from coked-out whores to merely dysfunctional housewives looking for some on the side. The one gay character with lines was stereotyped as a mincing little queen made almost faint by the overwhelming sexual prowess of Tom Cruise. Give me a break! Racial stereotyping was also pervasive, and not one moment of this film's so-called plot was unpredictable. If Kubrick hadn't croaked, this movie would have received all the rotten (and more to the point, honest) reviews it is due. Hell, the pace alone probably killed him. Anyway, if you enjoy being tortured for almost three hours, go see this film. If you're as fortunate as myself, you will get to see it with a bunch of sanctimonious Midwesterners, in which case you will find the audience's reaction more entertaining than what's on the screen.",Eyes Wide Shut
761,Cats Paw,Disappointed,1,18 July 1999,"This movie was very disappointing. The first thing that bothered me was the script. I expected quality writing, but it wasn't there. Then there was the acting. There were scenes where the audience was on the edge of their seats alright, but it was because we wanted them to hurry up and say the next word! An overheard comment when the movie was over summed it up nicely, ""It was as if the director said 'Count to three between each word!'""
Then there was the annoying single-note piano playing. Piano soundtracks have worked with other Cruise films, but in this one, it was just plain irritating.We get to see a lot of Nicole Kidman in the nude, but there is really very little sex. Yes, there's an orgy scene, but they've edited the film to place other people in strategic spots so you can't see anything. Some people want to see ""Tom and Nicole together."" Forget it. The one 'teaser' scene you see in the previews is all you're going to get. You see them with their tops off, and he starts to kiss her neck. Then she gets p***ed off and that's the end of that. You never see Tom have sex with *anyone*.Another irritating point is when Nicole is smoking pot. She (the actress) must have never smoked, because her reaction is totally wrong. She seems to talk even slower than she did before, and then starts getting angry. 'Tom' comments ""It's just the pot making you aggressive.""  What is this, an ad from the PDFA? *Alcohol* makes you aggressive, not pot.
All in all it was extremely disappointing and LONG. Way too long.",Eyes Wide Shut
762,Acorn-2,The Mountain has labored and brought forth a Mouse,5,20 July 1999,"EWS is an unfortunately incoherent adaptation of a book whose main ideas are a half-century behind the times. Kubrick applies his mighty skills to making a movie out of it, but is betrayed by his own lack of focus. This main fault is compounded by shaky performances by Kidman, who seems to be doing ""The Three Faces Of Alice"" and Cruise, who stares stoicly or covers his face whenever called upon to express emotion (except once when he sobs). In addition, there is the weakly obvious screen-play (which Kubrick co-wrote), and a leaden pace and self-indulgent editing that makes it seem even longer than it's nearly three hours. The film is one of Kubrick's least successful efforts, but given the level of his work, it's still better than most recent films, and worth a look. For more detail, see my review at The Nedpages, under the external reviews link in IMDb.",Eyes Wide Shut

Didn't anybody edit this film? Very irritating piano noise (hitting one key repeatedly does not qualify as music). The only reason it took three years or more to make is that they didn't know where it was going. None of your questions will be answered. Is it an elaborate hoax like ""The Game"" or is it a really scary sex-cult? They won't tell you so don't waste your money.

764,wfaulk,The most boring movie ever made,1,16 July 1999,"I cannot say enough bad things about this movie.  I had been passively looking forward to this movie for years, and actively looking forward to it since I heard it announced.  I absolutely love all of Kubrick's work. Except this.  It is, without a doubt, the most masturbatory piece of filmmaking I have ever seen.  Even the reasonably interesting, and occasionally beautiful, cinematography can IN NO WAY save the endless, plodding, poorly scripted, and worse acted film that, the most I can say, ran through a projector for three hours.  I realize that some folks will think I am hyperbolizing, or that I just don't like slow movies, but I like the rest of his work, and, for God's sake, I like Sergio Leone.  But this was like Sergio and Stanley constantly interrupting each other while on Quaaludes.All of the actors were evidently handed their scripts approximately thirteen seconds before shooting and only one take was allowed.  Most of the dialogue consisted of ""Uhhh,"" ten second pauses, and repetition of whatever was left over.To sum up, this was ... this ... was ... the most ... it was the most boring... the most boring movie ... the MOST ... boring movie ...  ever made.",Eyes Wide Shut
765,director-12,Eyes Wide Shut is exactly what my eyes were half-way through this boring and bad Kubrick film,1,19 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut is exactly what my eyes were half-way through this boring and bad Kubrick film.  Stanley Kubrick himself was a bizarre and eccentric guy, and he tried to serve up a display and or commentary to the darker side of human sexuality -- which probably parallels the director himself(who knows? who cares).  The subject matter of this film and the way it was examined misses the mark of good cinema by such a tremendous margin, and I'm sad Kubrick doesn't have a chance to try again now that he's passed on.  But then again, I don't care who you are.  If it takes you 75 takes on a single set-up during a single scene of filmmaking, then you are not a perfectionist, you are obsessive-compulsive and most likely very insecure. I feel bad for Tom and Nicole having spent a year and a half of their lives committed to this project.  What a waste.  And it seemed to me that Tom knew this much during his interview on 20/20.   While on the subject of Tom and Nicole, their performances(and most of the other actors as well) were the only redeeming factor of this film.  Their performances were the only characteristic of this film that kept me in the theater to the end. Otherwise, I would've walked half-way through the second act. Unfortunately, their material was the failure of this film, and, dare I say, the direction.The boredom that overcomes the viewer in Eyes Wide Shut is so prevalent by the third act, that you are most likely to be removed from any attachment to this film by the time the big orgy scene rolls around.  And then it becomes laughable because you have already lost respect for what the movie was trying to convey.  And what was the deal with the horrible scoring of this film?  That horrendous pounding of the single note from a piano was so disturbing that it removed me from any chance of being able to believe what was in front of me.  Audience members in the Los Angeles theater where I watched this movie were laughing every time that damn single piano key was struck.  I couldn't believe all the yawning, himming and hawing, and shifting in theater seats going on during this movie.  People were looking around and bored senseless.  The comments on the long crowded walk out of the theater chimed all the same notes:  this just wasn't a good movie -- not even close.Can Hollywood and the press please not pull another ""emperor's new clothes"" review on this film like they did with Terrance Malick's pathetic attempt at a war movie ""The Thin Red Line""?  I know people will be afraid to say Kubrick made a bad film.  Let's face it, it's bad.  It's easy to say it's a good movie, because it's cool to be a big fan of Stanley Kubrick.  So naturally, the reviews are more of a review of the man and possibly out of respect for the fact that he is dead.  But you have to call it like it is. This is exactly what Hollywood did for Terrance Malick's last film. Everybody began talking about how great this guy was and citing his last work as an example of his greatness.  Gee, I don't remember ""Badlands"" being on anybody's top twenty list of all-time greatest movies.  And suddenly, most of Hollywood is singing praises for the bad director who hasn't made a movie in over twenty years.  It's disgusting.  And Malick's ""Thin Red Line"" was much worse than ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  So don't be sucked in by this false hype.  Can I recommend you see this film in the theater?  No way.  On a scale of 1 to 10 -- I give it a 2.",Eyes Wide Shut
766,director-12,This movie blows. It's bad beyond compare.,1,22 July 1999,"I saw this movie in a popular Los Angeles cinema on its opening day.  I've never heard more yawning, himming and hawning, and shifting in theater seats like I heard during this movie.  And there's good reason:  this movie was bad.If you liked this movie, then you are just one of those bandwagon fans who doesn't have a mind of his own.  You probably liked Malick's joke-of-a-war-movie ""The Thin Red Line.""  Remember how everybody pulled the ol' ""emperor's new clothes"" bit with that guy?  Hollywood was afraid to say that this was one of the worst war movies ever made because they put so much money into his work.  And this is exactly the same response to Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.  This by far was one of the most boring films I've ever seen in my life of going to the cinema.  I feel embarrassed for anybody who says it was good.  I challenge those people to sit through it again. I'd rather go to the dentist.  And how bad was that score?  That horrific pounding of the single note from a piano was such a bad joke to anybody who knows how to score films.  Movie goers were laughing every time that single note pounded into our brains.  It failed in building suspense, and in fact, pulled me out of the scene all together.  And how laughable was that orgy scene?  Half the theater was laughing during that scene too.  And gee, we suffered so much because we couldn't actually see the actors simulating sex up close and personal.  As if that would've saved this bad movie.The only positive I can offer is that Tom and Nicole did a fantastic job with such bad material, and dare I say, such bad direction.  That's right, Stanley blew it with his direction.  And let's be honest, any guy who does 70 takes per setup per scene isn't a genius.  He's obsessive compulsive and sadly over-rated in his ability to work with actors.  Again, it's like Terrance Malick.  If you shoot 1.2 million feet of film in your movie, you're bound to come up with enough good shots to make yourself look good despite all your shortcomings.I cannot recommend this bad bad movie.",Eyes Wide Shut

I gawked with awe, laughing sometimes, amazed at Kubrick's cinematography, soundtrack and general filmmaking.  The deliberate pace of the shots as well as the painstakingly detailed sets wowed me.  As with most of Kubrick's films, there is a lot going on in the movies and each viewing is bound to reveal yet another layer.  This 2 1/2 hour film revolves around themes of jealousy, lust and highlights the pros and cons of practicing medicine in that warped Kubrickean sense of humor that I have come to know and love. This movie is not for everyone. It is a Kubrick movie. To put it in perspective, the people who read the New York Times best sellers probably aren't the same people who read the Pulitzer Prize winning novels.

The plot is a mess, the acting atrocious, and the dialogue verges on comic.  (In fact, this movie would play better as a comedy than the drama it pretends to be.)  I cannot imagine what Stanley Kubrick was thinking (or Cruise and Kidman, for that matter).If you are tempted to see this because you're a Kubrick fan, rent A Clockwork Orange again instead.  If you're looking for a provocative film about marital infidelity, check out One Night Stand (1997) instead.

Though perhaps not Kubrick's greatest film (I've always been partial to 2001 and Strangelove), it would be a lifetime achievement for most other directors. I can see where this film might not appeal to many people under 40 -- it is quite simply that ""adult"" in the true meaning of the word.  The movie nearly begs for previous life experience to understand it on a psychological level. And it is SO Creepy.  That surprised me more than anything, though maybe it shouldn't have.

It really includes all the elements that make a film or book exciting to watch: love, sex, adultery, mystery, murder.  I can remember the theater that I was had a problem with the film in the middle and I was upset because I was anxious to know where it was going.But I think because of the sexual controversy people miss the point of the film.  I think that it is proves a great point about how people don't always know everything about the ones they love, the people they know, or the world that exists around them.I also thought the music within the movie, just adds to the suspense as Cruise finds himself getting deeper and deeper into unchartered territory.",Eyes Wide Shut
772,rudypoo,Simply awful- a waste of time,1,2 August 1999,"I've always felt that Kubrick's movies were a mixed bag- from 2001 to Full Metal Jacket there were compelling scenes and pointless, boring ones as well.But it's a shame that this piece of utter garbage is what he'll be remembered for.  There's no other way to say it.One hundred and sixty five minutes of plotless, motionless movement that just had me begging for the end to come.  The one thing that really bothered me about this movie is that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get myself to care about anything that happened on the screen.  I can't say that about a lot of movies.  As I walked out people asked me about certain aspects of the movie, and I just shrugged my shoulders and said ""who cares?"".Kidman is basically used in this movie as a body and Cruise simply isn't made for roles like this.  Throw him into one silly, irrelevant scene after another and we get a nearly three hour message on monogamy.  Thanks, Stanley.    Don't be fooled into thinking this is a good movie by die-hard Kubrick fans- a spade's a spade.  Just go to the movie theatre and ask a handful of people what they thought of the movie- some people will say they loved it (Kubrick fans) and the rest will likely say they hated it.

773,Plectrum-2,A fitting final chapter indeed,4,26 July 1999,"EYES WIDE SHUT is a fitting final chapter to the Kubrick filmography, a beautifully crafted, sleekly designed piece of cinema that is ultimately overwhelmed by its faults. Nicole Kidman, while stunningly photographed, has too much screen time.  Think of it this way: to have the screen is to have the film.  Quite a few people now expect to see her onscreen longer than Gwyneth Paltrow was in SEVEN (a better take on much the same subject, with more at stake), even though this is essentially the same role.  But this is not her film. Tom Cruise is uncomfortably out of his realm here.  Not uncomfortable performance-wise--he did his best work since BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY--but he's not as believable as Tom Hanks or Cuba Gooding Jr. (the best part of INSTINCT) would be here: imagine them falling from grace!  Even Kubrick's original choice, Steve Martin, would have handled the ambiguity and quirks of fate that EYES dishes out with the tenuous restraint and explosive collapse that was needed, and still be able to establish empathy with the audience.  In what could have been his VERTIGO, Cruise instead rises to high emotions too soon, especially in a movie that screams ""languorous."" Which leads to pacing.  The strength of Kubrick movies such as 2001, THE SHINING and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is the length of takes, allowing the story to develop before your eyes.  But that is the weakness of a movie set in New York--a place where the speed of light isn't fast enough.  There are some beautiful moments captured here off the streets--the dreamy orgy scene is fabulously decadent--but the long takes in the middle of the City That Never Sleeps are not true to the setting, ironically the filmmaker's beloved hometown. There are bright spots: Sydney Pollack ratchets the ambiguity level higher, Rade Serbedzija is a twisted masterpiece, Leelee Sobieski is a blackened cherub and Alan Cumming is outright comic perfection.  But there are too many misses for each of these hits. I would recommend this film to those who enjoy playing ""what if,"" for if there's nothing else to be said of Kubrick's films, including EYES WIDE SHUT, they were meant to be talked about. Too bad",Eyes Wide Shut
774,DoctorJ-2,An enigmatic dream...,8,23 July 1999,"Eyes wide shut is the kind of movie that is made for discussing. I watched it in a nearly deserted theater and halfway through the film some people were starting to joke and laugh due to loss of interest while others (myself included) continued to watch with no little interest. Some of the comments overheard were ""what the hell was that?"" and ""magnificent...""A lush, visual movie filmed in amber and golden tones with a dark background, much like the plot itself: set in beautiful magnificent scenery, while darkly brooding, corrupt characters dance about.Are our dreams less important than our actions? Can  anyone have a meaningful relationship in today's society? If you have thought and fantasized of being unfaithful instead of actually trying to be unfaithful are you less accountable for your actions?These are some of the questions Eyes Wide Shut asks. And in true Kubrik fashion those questions linger long after the movie is over. That is the true importance of this movie and what gives it its appeal: it has substance along with aesthetics while many other art house movies (which eyes wide shut is no matter how comercialized WB tries to make it) offer a pretty package with no gift inside.On the subject of acting, I think it was quite appropriate for the movie, Cruise delivered his lines like Kubrik intended them. He's the kind of director that you either do it the right way or its the highway. The whole movie is played out like a slow deliberate theater play which ties in with some of the movies imagery concerning charades and masks.And finally this movie is unapologetically erotic and there is one particular scene were WB used digital characters to cover some actions that would have made the movie NC17, I think this was in poor taste.

I was not able to see the final cut (65 seconds longer than the released version) Kubrick turned in but as soon as it is made available, I am there.  Some may criticize this film for the amount of nudity.  I would challenge that it is not the amount you should be concerned with but instead the way in which it was used.  Kubrick takes the act of sex and the nude form and raises them to a level of beauty, art and to some degree, realism.  This film is just that, a film.  It is not a blockbuster movie that relies on quick cuts and disorienting camera work.  Kubrick allows you to see, even though the American movie rating system does not, what happens to a man who becomes so jealous with the thought that his wife would give up everything to be with another man.  You feel this film. The acting is top notch.  Tom and Nicole are pure and refreshing.  The scene where Nicole first reveals herself to him is one of the best scenes I have ever witnessed.  It is not just the acting, it's the way in which the scene is shot.  Watch this scene and watch how movement is used to display the emotion.I have watched this once and I would watch it again and again.  I find that the more I think about it, the more I love it.  That is the true test of a great film.

779,Michael-204,Sorry Stanley..,5,16 July 1999,"Although EYES WIDE SHUT does present some compelling moments, it finds itself divided into two films, which are supposedly meant to set up the contrast between sexual fantasy and reality, and what exactly drives the characters to their individual ends.  Cruise's experiences, which seem to explore his sexuality only to a minimal degree, are interesting in their own right,and perhaps would have made for a better film.Cruise's character, driven to pursuit of sexual adventure brought on by his wife's ""revelations"", seems to discover little about himself, and rather, he is exposed to the perverse sexuality of others.  How the events that follow relate to his relationship is questionable, and I felt a bit disappointed when the ""thriller"" aspect of the film was ultimately dropped, rather anti-climacticallyIt seems to me that thematically, Kubrick has some definite ideas, but trying hard to make them entertaining (and perhaps shocking), he wastes time that could have been spent on a more thoughtful interplay between Cruise and Kidman..  maybe I just took it the wrong way, but my initial impression regarding this film is a negative one...",Eyes Wide Shut
780,Medeea,The massacre of an idea,1,19 July 1999,"This movie is a sad illustration of how a wonderful book and an extremely interesting idea can be massacred into a ridiculous movie. Poorly directed and artificially filled with useless, time consuming scenes, this movie also ""benefits"" from incredibly bad acting. I would definitely rate it R for ridiculous.Or maybe it is me. Maybe I had too high expectancies. To be honest, I was dying to see how the complex micro-universe of the couple is seen under the magnifying glass of erotism. I expected to see two interesting characters able to redefine (sexual) happiness in their couple. I thought I would witness two sexually aware people facing the decision of holding their eyes ""wide shut"" and learning to live with their fantasies. All that directed by Kubrick should have been quite a treat, shouldn't it?
The only good scene of the movie, that of the orgy, is entirely copied from Fellini. All the rest of the movie is doomed to silliness and ridicule.
Nicole Kidman is unable to articulate herself in normally-paced English and almost all her scenes are  absolutely ridiculous. The last scene is a masterpiece in this direction. "" I... think... that... we... should... be... grateful."" That takes her 5 minutes. After that, exhausted by the effort of putting into words her abysmal feelings, she utters the F word again. Which word is so much abused in this movie that it loses even its vulgarity. Everything was bad enough, but that ending was also annoying.
The movie could have ended with the scene of her sleeping with the Venetian mask and saved us from another few scenes of pathetic stupidity and poor taste. Well, we weren't that lucky.Tom Cruise's acting was far beyond any critique. I have a hard time believing that he was aware of the fact that he was in a movie. It's pretty difficult to pick up such thing as his worst scene, but I guess he was particularly efficient in making the last scene with Victor Ziegler absolutely laughable.Stanley Kubrick, whom I still admire for some of his films, must have died out of shame for having directed such a profligate assault to the cinematographic good taste. Or maybe, knowing that that was his last movie, he did not want us to regret him too much as an artist.

I saw it two nights in a row and the second viewing was as revealing as the first and equally satisfying. Kubrick spent years on this project and every little detail is significant. Note that all the side and supporting characters are paid great attention to. In the second viewing I noticed details such as Cruise (as doctor) over the dead father: Cruise puts his hand on the dead man's head and the lighting produces the effect of the Godlike doctor. Another fascinating detail is his incorporation of many genres. The most interesting is when Cruise receives the letter of warning at the house - if you listen to the music and look at how we are meant to view the words of the letter - it sees like a silent movie (but only for maybe 10-15 seconds). Nothing has ever been better and I sit here at work with my eyes wide shut anticipating my next (third) viewing as I am well aware that as much as I have seen there is so much I still have to open my eyes to Really see.,Eyes Wide Shut

785,rnapier,"Good acting, great directing, but still weak",6,30 July 1999,"I loved Nicole Kidman. Alice is a dynamic character and I believe this is a great role for Kidman to show a lot of range. I wish the same could be said for the rest of the characters. Bill Harford (Cruise) is a flat character through the entire movie. You hope for tragedy or heroism (or at least decisiveness), but all I could feel for this character was pity. He is not a character that engages the viewer.This is not to say that Tom Cruise does a bad job. I believe he put the same dramatic talent into this as I saw in Jerry Maguire, a movie that I love. My complaint is that he plays Bill Harford too much like Jerry Maguire. He appears to have found a good character (somewhere around The Firm), and is now bringing it with him to each new job.I am a great fan of extended dramatic pauses, and I believe EWS occasionally makes brilliant use of them. Kidman is not afraid to be silent when it's ""her turn to talk,"" and this is very effective. At least at one point, the audience is aware of things several minutes before the players, which creates a wonderful kind of tension. But as with anything, there can be too much of a good thing, and EWS often goes beyond dramatic pauses into just pauses. Beyond just being a long movie, there is a sense that it really isn't going anywhere. Events that occur during a single morning feel more like they stretch over several days. The slowness of plot might be acceptable if the characters were more engaging, but given that Cruise has so much of the screen time and provides so little for the audience to relate to, it can be hard to stay with the movie the whole time.
Music is certainly a very important part of EWS, and the almost abstract nature of the piano pieces could have greatly added to the mood and suspense of the movie. Unfortunately it is often just too loud and jarring to do this effectively.Kubrick fans should certainly see this movie. It is a significant part of a defining career. Those interested in film as an art form should also go see it. There is plenty of material for discussion whether you enjoy the movie or not. Those just interested in a good movie, though, should probably look elsewhere. And despite the amount of nudity in this file, those looking for erotica should definitely look elsewhere.But I still loved Nicole Kidman.",Eyes Wide Shut

I myself am part of this demographic I suppose, so I thought that this movie might hold my interest somewhat.  Tom Cruise plays a lawyer who is married to a simple homemake (Kidman).  Cruise's character is, in my view, plagued by the need of a more sexually exciting life.  He is a curious type that seems to want to experience everything at least once. A good idea. However, the way this is portrayed is slow, boring, and simply uninteresting even with the nudity.

And that happens to be the weak point, where's the story, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise try to learn during the movie what..., well what actually, well of course I now, but I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that you would think Kubrick was capable of finding a more original concept. Now I understand this is his last movie and I mean no disrespect, but this movie is one of his lesser works, that is when you look at the content. If you'd like to watch a movie that makes you feel like you experience a dream, a piece of art and makes you feel like you're floating. Then this movie is definitely your cup of tea, if you're not looking for that, the movie is still worth watching but will be a bit poor on expectations.",Eyes Wide Shut
789,bart88,Kubrick's Did A Bad Thing,10,11 November 1999,"This film is amazing!!  Stanley Kubrick created a masterpiece before his death.  I spent so much time trying to figure out the symbolism after the movie was over.  During the movie, I racked my mind wondering what was going to happen next.  It was an extremely intense movie",Eyes Wide Shut
790,misternuts,America proved it could never learn a lesson from Stanley Kubrick.,10,3 November 1999,"How many times must we trash a Stanley Kubrick movie when it comes out, only to sing its praises years after the thrill is gone? Does anyone out there remember how ""2001"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" were received in the 1960s? The man put a little piece of immortality into each of his movies. I have no doubt that this one will be remembered and studied for many years to come. Even though there won't be a better movie this year, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is already being shut out of the best picture race by popular opinion. One day, we'll all look back at 1999 and see what we had. From the very first scene, the imagery is totally gripping. The story lags behind, but hits us as a surprise when Nicole Kidman delivers her sure-to-be classic monologue. Tom Cruise's blank and disturbed stare sets in, and the audience can FEEL it. It never leaves throughout the rest of the movie. From that point on, we are over-run with his deeply-rooted obcession. We can see how thin the Harford's marriage is, and Bill's sexual revenge mission is quite disturbing. He fumbles around with his sense of security and his recklessness is overpowering. I thought Tom Cruise's performance was very under-rated for these reasons. His cold mental images of his wife having sex with another man chill to the bone, and THEN we have the orgy. There's no way to discuss this movie without talking about the orgy, so if you haven't seen it yet, you might not want to continue reading. I've heard many characterizations of this sequence, and I think pro or con, all are inaccurate. Stanley Kubrick has a great habit of confusing his audiences with the juxtapositioning of real plot and allegorical plot. What we see at the orgy is a representation of what Bill sees in his mind. Just because his wife has confessed that she has the potential to be unfaithful, his mind has been swarmed with confusing mixtures of sexual jealousy, frustration, fantasy, and more. The sex is not hot and steamy, with great purpose. The realm of infidelity is ugly. The people mindlessly bang away, faceless (also with good reason), and emotionless. The act of sex is reduced to the most watered-down physical activity possible. This is the dillution of Bill's mind. The resulting circumstances for his intrusion into this world stem from a mental state that transcends words. It's exciting, and quite pleasantly takes on a mystery format. Those that criticize Kubrick for the orgy scene seem to forget his other works. Were we really expected to believe that Dave Bowman physically walked through a hotel room in the nether regions of the universe? Were we really expected to accept the Star Child as something tangible we could see through a telescope? Absolutely not. Kubrick uses devices like this to point to greater themes and ideas. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a masterpiece, and his technique is absolutely riveting. The music is as effective as anything he's ever put to an image, and this is truly one of his greatest. The only movie he's made that tops it is the legendary ""2001."" Only the test of time can reverse the roles, and it's my bet that this film will go down as the last masterwork of the 1900s.",Eyes Wide Shut
791,helverdi,A straightforward look on relations,10,2 December 1999,"I think the film mainly focuses on sexual relations in the civilized world. The players are so perfectly suited in their roles. Please look at Tom Cruise's development; from the teenager idol in ""Top Gun"" and ""Cocktail"" to a real good actor in ""Rainman"" and ""Interview with the Vampire"" and finally this movie. He is one of the industry's leading actors now. And Nicole Kidman. She has contributed much to the movie. As a result, the couple were wonderful.Stanley Kubrick has taken a sharp look in husband-wife relations. I couldn't help myself evaluating my own ideas on this subject. Since all art masterpieces have the same effect on us to awaken our ideas and discussions, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" should easily be regarded as one of the best.On the other side, the atmosphere was great. You can't even guess what was coming in the next scene or keep yourself out of the thrilling mood of dark NY streets. The scenes that were taking place in the ""orgy palace"" were so well-designed that I nearly believed that I was watching a different movie than the one up to those scenes.I think Kubrick has made a very straightforward movie on human feelings about sex. It is rather complex and still so clear. Many ideas and different movie techniques come perfectly together in a single film so smoothly. This is the talent of the director and how sad that we can't expect new additions to his career. Such skill comes so rare and we should keep on experimenting the art pieces that have remained of them.",Eyes Wide Shut

793,ljc3,What's it all about?,9,4 May 2000,"In my opinion, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is about male insecurity and stupidity. Bill Harford, a doctor, is led on a baffling and bewildering journey of sexual discovery after his wife's stoned confession that she once thought about sleeping with another man. I think it is in part an exploration of one man trying to view his relationship with his wife in terms of the outside world. His is a journey where he gains knowledge, not necessarily experience. He never takes part in any of the sexual adventures he sees played out in front of him. This impotence plays on him more and more, working him into a state of paranoia. The sexual theatrics of New York's elite are stunning sequences, and Kubrick's trademark humour shoots through the veins of this, his last film. It certainly has a specialised audience, and a fair number of detractors, but I was spellbound and amused. Despite all the female nudity, men are made out to be the dummies.",Eyes Wide Shut

795,julesbrian,"Critical of acting, directing, and whole film .",3,5 June 2000,"This film starts with the basic handicap of both leads being undeniably pretty, but utterly lacking in cinematic sex appeal. One of the reasons Kidman was so well cast in ""To Die For"" was the frigidity and detachment she brought to the part of a woman using her sexual charms to get where she wanted.  Add to this Cruise's lack of talent - to the extent that in some of the scenes when he was meant (I think) to be in an extremely emotional state, I honestly found it hard to tell whether he was laughing or crying, and in a scene where he sits in the back of a taxi, there is almost a voice-over saying ""Look at me; I'm brooding!""  True, there are lots of remarkably gorgeous women's rears, and some fronts, and some inevitably unrealistic sex, but I was left not only sharing most other critic's bafflement at what the picture was trying to say, but why on earth it was trying to say it - whatever IT was.",Eyes Wide Shut

Kubrick is certainly among my favorite directors. In his movies, he tryes to portrait an odyssey, in almost every single one of them.
2001 is the only who has the proper name to call it an odyssey.
""A Clockwork Orange"" an odyssey through violence or ""Full Metal Jacket"" an odyssey through war.
""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the the most risky one among the others odyssey because the subject that touches, which could be really belittled sometimes. An odyssey through sex.
It was promoted as an erotic film, and that's not what Kubrick wanted. Because of that, the movie was really hated.
If you are expecting the kind of movie where the protagonist screws with a bunch of people and there's a lot of hot staff, this isn't your movie.
EWS is a perfect thriller that combines the intimate side of the human being with the more superficial side of it.",Eyes Wide Shut

799,follyevan,Another Kubrick's masterpiece,10,8 February 2020,One of the best films ever made with exceptional cinematography,Eyes Wide Shut
800,graciaaaaa,On Kubrick's couch,9,17 April 2020,"""Eyes Wide Shut"". What a brilliant engagement in the subject, not giving me the occasion to hesitate on a wasted Monday. Finally, I let myself plunge into Kubrick's legacy.One thing that took all of my admiration was the lucidity in his definition of fantasm.
The story is simple: a dull couple is tortured by the sudden appearance of fantasm in their marriage. On one side, Bill, an ordinary American, wanders around New York, looking for sexual eccentricities. On the other, Alice, slowly deserts her married life for passionate oneiric meetings with the master of her heart.However, their fantasies turn out to be too high (or too far somewhere), in reality Bill and Alice always found themselves rejected by their desires (Bill face death every time he gets near to his sexual ambitions and Alice's sweet dreams are in fact nightmares). Kubrick demonstrates the state of dissatisfaction inherent in sex when it's imagined, when the fantasy expresses deeper repressed desires or scars (Alice's self esteem for exemple). This way of Kubrick to travel between the layers of reality or the mind, on screen, made the experience remarkably terrifying. Watching ""Eyes Wide Shut"" isn't only entertainment, it's taking part to some kind of cinematic reflection on perception (hence the oximoron wide/shut about vision in the title).In fact, what I also found astonishing in the movie was the thriller form (heavy silences, melodic rhythms, a dark gothic setting of NY) that was very well handled. Indeed, fear (rather than sympathy) accompanied the plot in a way that unveiled the purposes or spirit of the film. The thriller setting almost becomes a story by itself, along to the main subject (which is fantasy), for them to collide and produce reactions within the viewers or the characters (notice the reversal provoked by the mask lying on the marital bed). The movie is incisive, from stage to audience.""Eyes Wide Shut"", a beautiful and vivid analysis of psychosexuality. Anything as predictable as taking us into the heads of characters, but the mixture of elements fitting together and Kubrick's genius = grotesque, occultism, libertinism, death, denunciation, mystery, depression, love, desire, jealousy, dream, marriage, and anything else you notice. Us, viewers are the last element of the experiment. Our eye-opening journey innocently starts with the title, ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and involves us in an adventure full of discernment.",Eyes Wide Shut

802,styn_grieten,"confusion, illusion and unfaitfulness",9,7 August 2001,"This necessarilly slow movie has as main theme the meaning attached to marriage faithfulness. The illusion of a perfect marriage gets perforated by a confession of the woman (kidman); the man (cruise) runs on and seeks a nightly adventure to get square. The tought of an equilibrium is crucial in the film. The sexual orgies in the secret nightly masked ball (the scary, doom-music), make his adventures seem like a dream, sexuality and fear is interwoven. Basically, the unfaithfulness of kidman either wasn't more than a fantasy. The dream - reality theme also dominates the movie. The slowness of the movie makes it all seem so unreal, and fantasy-like, just as the music, often not more than one piano-sound. The end is a view of finding each other in a larger interpretation of marriage and a gives a hopeful perspective of relations. The suddenly unpredictability and confusion of the human mind is to be accepted, and even -to be shared- and can make a relation stronger and 'more real'.",Eyes Wide Shut
803,phryx,Very emotional and again something unexpected....,10,23 November 2007,"So I watched every movie Stanley Kubrick shot since Lolita and its very notable he always tried to invent himself again and again... I think he never worked except with Kirk Douglas with one actor two times, might that right? I'm not a great fan of Tom Cruise, he had really bad appearances and I don't like his unemotional style and also in this movie he had a little bit of it. But overall he played really well this time. And so did Nicole Kidman. The sequence shortly after Cruise arrived at home and Nicole tells him her bad nightmare was very true and real. Also the scenes in the house were really harmonious and I really felt with Cruise in these moments. Though the movie is a two and a half hour drama of epic dimensions it could even be longer because it was never, not even one second, boring... for example the party sequence: I remember a lot of party scenes like this in hundreds of movies, but I can't remember one, which was so near to the people. The dance sequence between Sky Du Mont and Nicole Kidman is so near to them you have to watch them because its so... its hard to describe... fascinating, although they just talk about complete nonsense. I think that's very notable for Stanley Kubrick, there is under no circumstances an actor who is just there and if he wouldn't it would be not important, If you remember the guy from the costume rental, or the guy at the reception of the hotel... both of them had maybe 30 seconds, maybe a minute in the movie but you remember them as a person because they had a distinct character. So all in all I just can say: If you like movies where the plot evolves very close you have to watch this movie but If you expect just a 90 minutes amatory drama, go and watch any Hollywood movie, because this is the real art of cinematography. ;-)",Eyes Wide Shut
804,maury_markowitz,"Visually interesting, but little else to recommend it.",4,28 March 2006,"Kubrick seems to have had a habit of vacillating between movies that are primarily visual and plot driven, and ones that are word-heavy. Sparticus was followed by Lolita, 2001 by A Clockwork Orange. Eyes wide shut falls into the later category, and frankly, Kubrick's never been very good at it.The entire movie is based on a simple premise; the male lead is astonished to learn that his wife has (unfullfilled) sexual fantasies involving other men. This leads to an escalating series of events that fills the rest of the movie.The problem is that we're supposed to believe that this admission would actually be surprising to anyone. Is there any man that is not aware of this fact? I can see this being a plot of a movie from the 1960s perhaps, but today it simply feels outdated, maybe even misogynist. An actual affair sparking things off might be believable, but he's upset because she _looks_ at other men? Come on! It just doesn't ring true. The plot feels completely artificial.To add to the problems, the movie is heavily based on dialog, and it is here that Kubrick always seems to fall flat. The dialog is filled with pregnant pauses and flat dialog, one assumes deliberately, that simply add to the overall artificiality of the plot. People simply don't talk like they do when Kubrick directs them, and I found it sad to see two otherwise fine actors (yes, Cruise is a fine actor) reduced to a series of bland, empty statements. There was nothing remotely like emotion coming out of either one. Nothing could put this into better contrast than the final line of dialog, which Kidman delivers in an astonishingly unconvincing manner.On the good side, Kubrick's visual taste remains as good as ever. The motion is slow, but this is deliberate, and works well. It would have worked much better had the movie been 120 minutes, instead of 159. Once again it seems Kubrick couldn't resist the siren-call of introducing bit characters, filling up some time and then instantly cutting them adrift.I have to say that overall the movie isn't _that_ bad. Faint praise indeed, I know. But simply put, if not for Kubrick's earlier body of work, and well-timed death, this movie would have disappeared without a trace.",Eyes Wide Shut
805,CMPDumont,One of my favourite movie,10,15 February 2015,"We'll never know for sure if Stanley Kubrick was proud of it or not, but I wish he was, because he should. You know, when you are watching a movie and you feel like you're in suspension for 2 hours? One of these movies that puts you in a weird place, but you are so captivated that you can't stop watching for reasons that you can't explain yourself? I don't want to spoil anything so just let me tell you that it's one of these movie that you will love or you will hate. It's not fast pace and it's a complex story. I read the book and even though Kubrick stick to pretty much all of it, I must say that the movie is far more interesting than the book (have you ever heard that? Ever?)",Eyes Wide Shut
806,BuildDiscipline,How disturbing sex(ual fantasies) can be...,10,10 July 2015,"I'm writing this with the chanting of the initiation scene of the masked ball running through my head, over and over again.Kubrick's movies don't come alive on first viewing. At least they never did for me. It's with the second of third viewing that you begin scratching the surface of the first of many layers of meaning that his masterpieces have to offer. Last night was my second viewing of 'Eyes Wide Shut' and it left me disturbed, dumbfounded and questioning.I haven't stopped asking myself: 'What is this movie really about?'. It is not simply about sexual desire, or lifelong commitment to another human being, nor is it about an illuminati kind of world that operates next to our society that we are completely unaware of. These are just the symbols that Kubrick plays with. But what do the symbols mean?What I think Kubrick wanted to do with this movie, is to show how deeply disturbing sex and sexual fantasies can be. It is a feeling that can hardly be expressed using words, which is why Kubrick tried it with this film.Bergman was on the same mission when he made 'Persona', which this movie strangely kept reminding me of. Watch it and see for yourself whether you can find the similarities. Keep an eye out for disturbingly explicit sexual fantasies that are being expressed by a woman. Hearing that as a man feels like being being stabbed in the heart by your own partner, laughing, which is exactly what Alice did in her sleep.Side note: The cinematography of this movie reminded me of David Linch' Twin Peaks at times. Especially of the dream scenes. When I woke up this morning, the first thing I wondered was: what if Alice was actually present at the orgy? The dream she described is very similar to the orgy scene at the masked ball, except she could hardly have been physically present. What if she was mentally present somehow? What if the whole thing was some sort of (collective) dream? A merging of sexual desires and fantasies. The place where they come true.What is blatantly obvious is how important William's occupation and title as a doctor is. I don't know how many times he pulled out his ID throughout the movie to identify himself as Dr. Harford, but if you were to make a compilation of it it would be hard to believe that this was all in just one movie, instead a whole TV series. What does this mean? Why is his role as a doctor so important and how does it relate to what Kubrick was trying to achieve? I don't have the answer and there probably is not just one answer, but I feel the question is important. Does it have to do with identify? Status? Or with the fact that deep down, he is a good human being? He lives up to both the Hippocratic Oath as a doctor and his oath as a married husband. He's had at least 4 opportunities to cheat throughout the course of the movie, but he never did. It makes you wonder: why didn't he? 'Fidelio' (faithfulness) was the only word he knew and spoke with confidence at the intervention at the masked ball... When he was called to Ziegler's room to fix the situation with the OD'ing prostitute Mandy, he did so in such a professional manner and we never saw the two models he was flirting with before, again. His profession and his oath are clearly more important to him than fulfilling his own sexual desires. Even though he may look and act like a flirt.Was he being honest when he told Alice that he only thinks about the health of his client when he is in his role of a doctor? Was he mentally fidelio?We know Alice wasn't. She admitted to have cheated on him mentally, which raises the question: is mentally cheating cheating as well? It certainly feels that way to William, who put on a fake smile when he saw Alice helping their daughter with her math. Their marriage was no longer the same.The scene where William is sitting in the taxi, picturing his wife having sex with the marine, may be the most pivotal scene of the movie. You can feel how disturbed he is by the mere fantasy of his wife being unfaithful. It destroys him. And as a man, I know exactly what that feeling feels like. I know you do too.Wrapping up, Kubrick beautifully showed one of the many paradoxes that we find ourselves stuck in as humans: to be able to physically fulfill our sexual desires, but not being able to live with them mentally and the exact other way around.",Eyes Wide Shut
807,ShadeSiren,Worst Movie EVER,1,1 December 2005,"I freely admit I watched this movie partly due to the ""sex"" publicity, and partly because it was Kubrick film, and everyone talks about what a genius he was supposed to be. I also only watched it because it happened to be on cable when there was nothing else on.The music drove me up the wall - one guy, with one finger, hitting the same damn note on the piano until I was ready to kill someone. I ended up muting the movie to avoid the music. Music gets -5 stars.The movie didn't make any sense to me - the ending invalidated the movie to me. ""Stuff happened, and it greatly impacted our lives, but lets pretend it never happened, and go on as if it didn't."" No real resolution, just a vague resumption of their lives, and a sort of unvoiced agreement to pretend it never happened.The sex scenes were strange, cold, and clinical. The acting was wooden, boring, and confusing.I found the stuff with Leelee Sobieski's character confusing and creepy, and instead of finding her cool as usual, it was just.. kinda gross.I know this was supposed to be Kubrick's final opus, but I found absolutely NOTHING redeemable about this, and in fact, felt stupider for having sat through it. Cruise is vague, Kidman a waste, and Sobieski a waste. I recommend you avoid this movie unless you just REALLY must see Kubrick's last flick, just cuz you feel you need to, or you liked his other movies.

The script is slow and stupid, giving birth to one of the most boring film I have ever seen in my life. I am not surprised that Kubrick died before finishing it because it's so bad that he spent 9 years of his life working on it, and he died before putting a final hand to it. The script is incredibly idiot. For example, Tom Cruise's character is supposed to be a great Doctor and, when he goes to see a prostitute he doesn't even use a condom! So he gets HIV positive.The image has a very good quality and this aspect of this Z-rated-late-night-TV-Show kind of film, is probably the best. The colors are really worked. But the action and the dialogs are so flat that even if there are good actors, they don't have any occasion to prove it here.The good thing is I didn't go to the theater to see this movie. A friend of mine lent it to me, on tape. I almost fell asleep in front of it. This is such a bad movie that I'm sorry that it was Kubrick's last one. He could do much better.

815,ilovemoovies,Stupid film,1,10 May 2017,"This film was made for an old mans wet dream. It makes very little sense. Tom Cruise proves he can't act. Nicole shows she has no passion for Tom. In this film After Dr. Bill Hartford's (Tom Cruise) wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), admits to having sexual fantasies about a man she met, Bill becomes obsessed with having a sexual encounter. He discovers an underground sexual group and attends one of their meetings -- and quickly discovers that he is in over his head.There is plenty of people that will love this film because the director to them is the 2nd coming of Jesus. To me his movies are always way too long and too slow, ""EWS"" is no exception.",Eyes Wide Shut
816,GratefulJBG,Watch it again (and again),10,6 January 2008,"If you don't understand why this film is on par with Kubrick's best, I strongly recommend you watch it over and over until you get it. Rob Ager's wonderful analysis, parts of which can be found on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj7Hw6OnbH8), will clue you in as to why you owe it to yourself to do so.In my opinion  and 2001 is the greatest film I have ever seen  Eyes Wide Shut is on the level of 2001 in terms of its calling us to question the nature of our humanity. The dumbstruck critical reaction to EWS was not due simply to some botched marketing campaign  although expectations of some kind of soft-core porn will surely leave you disappointed if you can't shake that preconception. Rather, the underrating of EWS is a factor of one's viewing the film as a film. It is decidedly beyond just a film. It is a laser beam through your third eye. It is a journey down into the rotting bowels of your subconscious.Certainly, and perhaps particularly if you are an American, parts of it should make you very disgusted with yourself. Whether there is some redemption in EWS is up to you, but I don't think there is. On the surface of the film we are shown how venal transactions and the objectification of women cut through all strata of society, varying only in the level of grotesque and willful disregard for the human soul. We see an idle rich aspirant get a wake-up call about his place in society. We see a married couple come clean about their dark fantasies and ambivalence. But this is truly just the beginning. Once the phone rings in the Harfords' bedroom, the real voyage begins  in us, through Bill Harford's adventures (be they real, a vision of the collective unconscious, or a lucid dream somehow unfolding in real time in both husband and wife).In EWS, the questions we are urged to ask ourselves relate more to our fears and desires and the foundations of society as opposed to our evolutionary history and trajectory. However, nearly every shot in EWS is so saturated with images, objects, penetrating (if sometimes sparse) dialogue, inside jokes, etc., that I would argue that with respect to set design and mise en scene, and even costuming, it trumps 2001. I can only imagine trying to catch all of what is going on by watching the film in slow motion. Just try to keep up with the textual objects in the film (e.g. signs) and you'll have to be on your toes! If it is true that the studio edited Kubrick's final cut, or that he did not have time to ""polish"" his final work, then this is truly a shame. Yet, the film remains a masterpiece. I hope someday it will be able to be seen in whatever version Stanley intended, because not only does EWS turn a mirror onto ourselves, but it allows, as do his films in general, a fearless and honest glimpse into the very heart and soul of one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.",Eyes Wide Shut

I can see where non-Kubrick fans would be going ""Huh"" but that happened with ""Space Odyssey:2001"" too. From listening to comments made by audience members exiting the film I think people were expecting a soft-porn film; I have no doubt the hype and secrecy suggested that mind-set.  Cruise gives a knock-out performance. My one gripe is: I didn't feel Kidman's performance stands up to her husbands.  She was so much better in Van Sant's ""To Die For"".  Still, she looks exquisite which is all part of the ""look"" of the film. A must-see for Kubrick fans.",Eyes Wide Shut

Camera work superb - did Stanley operate the steadycam as well?.Sets wonderful, though the New York built street sets were not quite realistic, but perhaps that was intended. Because I was in N. America I saw the CGI  censored version. I do not think it distracted from the film because it was quite obvious what was happening. But I object to someone deciding what I can or cannot see and sneakily hiding the fact that they have done so, and at the same time destroying the composition of a master.

Though Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman made an honest attempt to salvage the film through their decent performances,  the rest of the movie seemed rather plotless, pointless, and contained only one noticeable theme: sex. More storyline could be found on a porn flick.  It wasn't until I read the reviews in the paper the next morning when I realized what the whole movie was even about. Monogamy? I didn't get that from watching the movie at all. Perhaps Stanley Kubrick is just not my type of director.

For those who haven't, I assume it was a short scene involving a lesbian 69 that was obscured.

What I saw, though, was a really good movie that could probably have been better.   Cruise is amazing in the movie, and you can definitely tell it's a Kubrick movie (ie. It lets us think about the characters, it doesn't tell us right away what there thinking), but Kidman was disappointing.  The movie, on a whole, was enjoyable, but it doesn't live up to the hype.  I had to remind myself that I'm not watching Dr. Strangeglove, 2001, or Full Metal Jacket, but a different movie by a great director.

I think both Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise are good actors and thought the plot sounded interesting.  And it was... for a while.  The beginning of the movie was great.  The party where Nicole gets tipsy and then the scene in their bedroom where they're talking about jealousy.  Then they lost me and most of the people who were in the theater with me.  Parts of the rest of the movie were interesting.  Cruise's scene with Vinessa Shaw and the storyline with the father pimping his daughter were fine.  But other parts of the movie were just odd.  Cruise buying a costume to go to a party, the party itself which had naked women in a circle while some strange man banged a stick on the ground just baffled me.  It added nothing to the movie.  The movie was disjointed and just when you hoped it would end, it kept going.  What could have been a thought-provoking movie about jealousy left me thinking why two good actors would do this movie and why I spent ten dollars and almost three hours of my own time watching it.  I really wanted to enjoy this movie.  I went to the theater with high expectations.  Maybe they were too high. Maybe I just didn't get it.  Or maybe the movie just was not a good movie.",Eyes Wide Shut

There are far too many dramatic pauses, and let's face it, no one in the world speaks as slow as Nicole Kidman does in this movie. Speaking of good ol Nicole, I am amazed that the Academy was able to forgive her enough after this film to give her an Oscar. She is absolutely terrible in this film except when she is not speaking. Which, since she makes so many pauses, is quite a bit of the time. Cruise is ok, nothing spectacular. Here's my suggestion to those of you who haven't seen it: 1. Don't spend your money on renting or buying it. 2. If you can get it for free, go for it. But 3. Fastforward to the part where Nicole and Tom are smoking pot. Stop and watch. Fast forward to the part where Tom meets his old med school buddy. Stop and watch. Fast forward to the part where he arrives at the orgy palace. Stop and watch. Fast forward to the point where Tom meets up with Ziegler. Stop and watch. Turn off the movie. Believe me, you won't be missing anything.",Eyes Wide Shut

The only good thing about it is the choice of both leading actors - they are just as plastic as they were obviously supposed to be.There is one real drama here - the tragedy of Kubrick the old man. I don't think it would be hard to explain and analyze it, but I am not going to try; I respect Kubrick far too much for all the great movies that kept inspiring me through many a decade.

827,TheHun,INDIFFERENCE OF THE UNIVERSE,10,26 August 2001,"The problem with seeing a Stanley Kubrick movie for the majority  is the frustration that it doesn't yield to any cliche. Worse, not only it's not spoon fed, but also it shatters the usual expectations creating an enigmatic feel which deep down disturbs its audience and the critiques in their subconscious. These two elements, integral to each Kubrick film, that is, the indifference/darkness of the universe we live in and the truth of a thing lying in the feel of it, are alien to Americana (in its dominant global sense). Most become perplexed as to what his movies really mean, why they are recognized as great (in fact, most masterpieces), and for whom they are made except perhaps his arrogant self. Again the same questions are asked and the same comments are made on Eyes Wide Shut (EWS). ""Slow, nonsensical, unlike any New York, outdated eroticism, etc..."". From an obscure novella of Arthur Schnitzler (Freud's friend) written in 1926, Kubrick has made another immortal film and despite his genuine desire to reach out to the world, he again couldn't break the box office. That was always his paradox. Making movies on universal indifference that dissect the very same and make people feel their inert apathy is not how you win the tickets. EWS is a dream movie (in line with Schnitzler's original title The Dream Novel) with each shot radiating multiple meanings/feelings in pulsating color combinations, lens selections, set and costume design, and camera movements. Christmas trees appear in most settings, Dr. Harford uses his medical ID as a pass to everywhere, female nudity (from the ingenious opening sequence as a Kubrickian laughter to viewers) is over displayed throughout, masks match character traits... all accompanied and contrasted with an unforgettable sound track starting with Shostakovich's waltz and heavily using Ligeti's anti-Stalinist notes (a favorite composer of Kubrick's), the whole film is one heated feel of dreamy confusion of love, fidelity, jealousy, and eroticism that intensifies the more is gets detached from physical nudity. You may not enjoy EWS now, but you will one day, like all other Kubrick movies which stand the test of time. His death is a real loss to the world. Yet he left behind about 10 kaleidoscopic masterpieces, reflecting new meanings each time viewed. As Scorcese says, ""One Kubrick movie is like ten made by another director"". Aaron",Eyes Wide Shut

The press about the crafting is accurate, and maybe I can understand the length of production.  I didn't think it was very sexy however, and I don't think that's just because I'm gay.  It was more than sexy, it was something new that we've seen before: the art of Stanley Kubrick.  [What does that mean John?]  (I don't know.) It did have a plot, and a strange, somehow suspicious, message. Kubrick was self-indulgent in making and editing Eyes Wide Shut, but I felt self-indulgent watching it.  The use of light was fantastic, really the most memorable part of the film. I could understand why people were laughing, but I was not laughing.  The movie carried itself. Two women stopped us outside the theatre and surmised that we'd just seen it.  They'd walked out and wanted to know how it ended.  I said, ""You walked out.""  We didn't tell them.",Eyes Wide Shut

Eyes Wide Shut proves to be a must for any Kubrick fan but is not recommended for the average viewer of escapist entertainment. My only complaint is that the MPAA made WB change 65 seconds of the film for the goal of receiving an R rating. Several digital characters were added to the print during an orgy scene. Their intended purpose was to cover up any random genitalia that might have been exposed. I wouldn't have any problems with this under normal circumstances, but Kubrick had no say in this. He died only four days after turning in the final negative to WB. They had no right to change his work. They should have kept it the way it was to preserve his memory.I am sorry for my little rant but I feel very strongly about this. The moronic MPAA have been on Kubrick's case from Lolita to Clockwork Orange. Despite all of this, the movie is definitely worth seeing. It is fairly long (159 min.

Dr. Bill is a true mechanical man, despite his job as a healer of bodies.  But he can't suppress dat ol' debbil.  Even worse, he can't forgive his wife Alice for her fantasied infidelity.  A study of men and women -- the woman holds the high ground because of her compassion, and her honesty, which includes her acceptance of her animality. The script's last word is K's last hope for returning to our lost essence. God, those skin tones!  Kubrick's use of available light and high speed film raises primitive technique to sublime sophistication. But that's the point, isn't it.  The naked ape creates stunning mechanisms -- laws, social norms, movies -- in a hopeless attempt to purify human existence. Kubrick grins sardonically, but can't stop joining in.

Generally the movie never gives the audience what it came for. This will annoy some viewers (perhaps many), but Kubrick did something similar with THE SHINING, which is basically an anti-horror film.

We struggled through the downtown traffic to catch an early evening showing and were sorely disappointed that we'd bothered. The advance plot details turned out to be largely spurious and the trailer is fairly unrepresentative of what the film is about. Tom Cruise fails again to offer any evidence of major-league acting talent to back up his pay packet and Nicole Kidman was a huge disappointment after To Die For and Dead Calm, almost sleepwalking her way through the very overlong film. The plot can charitably described as slimline and the weighty themes and important points hit the screen with an almost audible clang - possibly trying to complete with the plinking minimalist piano soundtrack. There were some good scenes and nicely played moments and an effectively captured sense of naturalism though lack of background score and flat/static single camera setups, but these were lost in the landslide of disappointment. I spent the last thirty minutes of the film trying to think of a cast and director who could have done a more efficient, tighter and more entertaining job and came up with at least 5 other candidates.

I am sorry to say that I left the theater a little disappointed.In my movie watching experience I have noticed that some of the movies that get the most promotion and hype don't live up to their praise.  I wouldn't say that it was a bad movie but, it was lacking in something.  Something I am unsure of.  The beginning was slow and it wasn't until about the middle that my attention was caught.  It is hard to describe with out giving away some of the movie but it was just ""strange."" I can't think of any other words to describe it.  The end also left me unsure of what had happened in the movie.  They never fully explained the main incident in the movie.  I like closure when I see a movie.  Even movies that you know will have a sequel have closure.  But I do agree with a fellow critic.  The music was well chosen and adds to the mystery and intrigue of the plot.  All in all ""Eyes Wide Shut"" wasn't a favorite for me but I don't discourage anyone from seeing it.  For those who like abstract movies that leave you to do the figuring out, you will enjoy it.

Everyone in the States should write or contact the MPAA and tell them to use an A for movies with adult themes rather than the heavily connotated NC-17.This movie deals with the deceptions that married people have.  Because of the openess and the honesty conserning these deceptions, the comfortable lives of two people are up rooted.

After seeing it for myself, I wasn't surprised. People who are in long-standing sexual relationships are going to be the ones who appreciate Kubrick's mature, honest approach to the possible dark side of every relationship. Relationships can sometimes seem like a tightrope walk between loving someone and hurting them. It doesn't take much to move from one to the other.One of the details that I appreciated about Eyes Wide Shut is the way in which it allowed the main characters to be wealthy and still arguably normal. Wealthy people in films are too often portrayed as either spoiled and bratty or psycho and drunks. The activities that Tom Cruise's character ends up involved in are pretty out there, but the way in which he became involved and his and Nicole Kidman's reactions all seem normal and healthy.",Eyes Wide Shut

853,pale69rider,The Best Film of 1999,10,5 January 2000,"""Eyes Wide Shut"" weaves its web of psychological carnage with a power that has nothing to do with taste, or preference. Kubrick's images are undeniable and very, very startling. The eye must watch. There is a remarkable trademark of Kubrick's that lies in his spacing of dialogue. It is never as simple as ""He said"" - cut to Her - ""She said"". That is the formula, but Kubrick always cuts away early. He leaves a discernible pause. This creates a note of discord (emphasized in the music score with its jarring one-note piano stabbings), in that everyone who speaks in his films appear to be studying one another. People speak in measured tones, but rarely communicate themselves well to one another. Many have spoken of Kubrick's ""coldness"" as a filmmaker, and it is true that he always keeps his characters at arm's length, distancing them from each other and us. But the reason behind this would appear to be that in doing so, the film's eye catches everything. Nothing gets overlooked in the heat of the moment, in the messiness of emotional embrace. We watch Kubrick's players watch.I have heard tell of a comparison with ""The Matrix"", which I find especially perceptive. Here, the matrix is created by us, by our own psychological make-up. Which of course is more terrifying and pessimistic, as well as more truthful. While Kubrick unsettles with his world of penetrating observers, there are moments of participatory activity, but tellingly, it occurs in dream. Kidman's character is frightened by her dreams of actively humiliating and degrading her husband, more still because she secretly revels in it. Cruise, on the other hand, goes on a tripped-out 48 hour adventure in which he tries desperately to play the role of ""outsider"" his wife so desires, only to be discovered, revealed and publicly shamed. Kubrick's contrasts are obvious, but sooooo compelling: Kidman is active and cruel in her dream-life, Cruise is passive and reflective in his waking existence. As the film ultimately asks at its conclusion, is one more innocent than the other?""Eyes Wide Shut"" may not be the most optimistic portrayal of a marriage and its strengths, but Kubrick has again, and sadly for the last grand time, allowed us to see through his eyes a world where the notion of communication is not taken for granted. His people struggle to express, and seem all the more human for it. Let it be said that Kubrick's eyes were always wide open, and to the details most of us figured too mundane to truly appreciate. He will be greatly missed.",Eyes Wide Shut

It takes an 2 1/2 hours to get delve into a marriage and come up with absolutely no insights whatsoever.  The characters are shallow and uninteresting, the orgy plot is predictable and pointless, and the mood of the film was somewhere between dull and turgid (I don't think this is what Kubrick was going for).Face it, Kubrick really failed with this one (and Spielberg's AI, which was primarily developed by Kubrick, wasn't much better).

This movie is about sex, love... and I think mostly about trust... How do you trust someone if you know they've thought of another?  Is just thinking it as bad as actually doing it?  Is there such thing as only a dream?  I love the music in the film... and I love the trip Cruise's character takes to the... strange place.  It's all very fantastic.. I think that part represents how EVERYONE has these thoughts and does these things... but that (the masks) no one really knows what other people do...

But I find it to be forgiveable, considering the many high points of this film.  The attention to minor details and characters made Dr. Bill's journey more intriguing.  Dr. Bill was painfully bland, sort of an everyman.  I too, was drawn in by that hooker with a heart of gold.  The scene where Dr. Bill is brought in to be questioned before the man in the red cloak at the orgy is chilling, no matter how many times I see it, as it is when he is getting stalked on the streets.  And the movie kept my interest, especially as Dr. Bill's actions the night before eat away at him as he searches for Nick and Mandy until he finally breaks down at home with his wife. And as always, the grand director has created a surreal and fascinating world in this film.  To me, that's what makes watching movies worth it.

Movies like this are the perfect example, how a movie should never be made.Don't make out this movie to be some classic just because it was the last movie that the director directed.

What Kubrick delivered is a unique character study.Cruise and Kidman give brilliant understated performances.Other characters in the film are brilliantly cast no matter how short their screen time.There is a deep undercurrent of evil and nastiness running throughout the film that is unsettling.Cruise's character takes a step outside his normal daily life that is solid and successful and safe into a world he does not belong in, one of danger and menace. Nobody is who they seem.He is in unchartered territory. Kubrick must take credit for the ambience and look of the film and the pace at which the film unfolds, he will lose people's interest along the way but he doesn't care and does not conform,that is why Kubrick is a Cinema great.When Spielberg took to directing their shared interest project 'Artificial Intelligence' he ultimately conformed to making the film a certain way, Kubrick would have made a bolder,darker,colder and ultimately better film.We can only think what would have been. In Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick has left us a small miracle of a film.It will probably never attain the classic status of his best work (which I rate as 'Lyndon','2001' and 'Clockwork')but should be remembered as a daring and audacious work. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*!! A word about Tom Cruise.His was an excellent performance that has gone without deserved praise.Note his acting in two particular scenes - when he goes to see the dead girl in the Morgue and also when he goes to see Ziegler who tells him that he knows about everything that has gone on. Cruise never gets really great critical appraisal but he deserved something for this project.

If they can't easily understand a story - i.e. - they can't explain it to themselves easily, they say ""hate it."" Kubrick, more than any other director, made films that told stories as only film can tell. His films can't be reduced to words.

Kubrick succeeds in what many good filmmakers failed before him- and conveys a beautiful imagery of our state of dreams, full of sexual symbolism and other dream-like symbols (notice the stop signs in the streets in front of Tom Cruise), and creates a feeling of total wandering; although consistent, due to the fact that every scene and dialogue is vital and neccecary for the film's development.Moreover, Kubrick's use of music is even more genius than always, and Ligeti's motif from Musica Ricercarta shows us the repetitive nature of dreams, together with a feeling that we don't know where to go next.And of course there is a note of marriage life, men's sexuality (and the attempt to deny women's sexuality) and the very fine acting of Cruise and Kidman, which was a postlude of there own relationship.For me, this is the finest, most perfect film of Kubrick, and therefore one of the best films of all.

877,director237,The haunting final chapter in a master director's career.,9,2 December 2005,"Eyes Wide Shut was Stanley Kubrick's final masterpiece in which he left the audience for the last time with a feeling that cannot be put into words. The film takes off after Alice(Nicole Kidman)gets angry with her husband Bill(Tom Cruise)because he has never been jealous of her in their marriage of nine years. In order to give Bill a wake-up call she reveals to him an event that happened a year before while they were on vacation. Alice tells him that she was attracted to a navy officer,who she saw, so much that she could have given up her entire life with Bill and their daughter if the officer had wanted her for just one night.This upsets Bill and he begins seeing images in his mind of his wife and the officer together. He only comes to fully believe that a woman could leave her man for another man she does not even know when he makes a house-call to one of his patients. There the woman, who's father has just died, tells Bill that she loves him and kisses him. Dr-Bill can't understand why this woman has fallen in love with him even though they barely know each other. Right after this, Bill meets the woman's fiancé Carl, who is a guy just like Bill, and then it really kicks in that what Alice was telling him could possibly happen.Infuriated with his wife, Bill sets off on a sexual odyssey that night for revenge, but also discovery. His journey leads him to a prostitute, and to a secret mask and costume party that he should not have attended because he not only puts one woman's life on the line, but also puts himself and his family in grave danger.Stanley Kubrick will have you hanging on every single word in every single scene in total suspense in this haunting film. It is one of Kubrick's best films,even though they are all magnificent in their own way. The screenplay is superb, the acting is intense, and the direction is unbelievable. There are all the trademarks of Kubrick's art present in Eyes Wide Shut and the atmosphere is utterly chilling. You have never seen Tom Cruise in a role like this either.

880,highplainsdrifter-63381,Kubrick's Masterpiece,10,23 August 2017,"The short descriptions and plot summaries, here and elsewhere, while perfectly accurate, really don't do this film justice. It takes place in New York City, over the course of several days, and centers around Tom Cruise and his efforts to deal with a very strange situation in which he finds himself.Tom Cruise plays a doctor and the main protagonist, Nicole Kidman is his wife, Sydney Pollock is his very wealthy friend and patient. While the actors all do an excellent job, IMHO the real star of this film doesn't appear on screen at all. The real star is the Director, Stanley Kubrick. The way he adapts the story from the novel ""Traumnovelle"", elicits wonderful performances from the entire cast, controls the mood with great music, and orchestrates the whole thing into a riveting experience, in my view make him the real star.There are so many delicious little sub-plots that, while they could have been greatly simplified, as they are they add a dimension of character and color that make the film far more interesting. The scenes where Tom Cruise speaks with a gay hotel clerk, or deals with a costumer played by Rade Serbedzija (along with his nymphomaniac daughter and her two boyfriends), or finally confronts Sydney Pollock at the end, almost stand alone as great little character pieces that not only help tell the story, but become little side branches that add to the whole.That said, for me the best scene of the film is at the ""House"", where the good doctor finds himself immersed in a very bizarre and dangerous situation. I won't say any more than that, just watch for that scene.This film works on so many levels. There's the main plot itself, where Tom Cruise tries to deal with a strange but all-too-real situation. The terrific little sub-plots with wonderful, if slightly off-beat, supporting characters. The music, especially at moments of high tension.Unfortunately, Stanley Kubrick passed shortly after finishing this film. It is often considered his masterpiece, and deservedly so. This is easily one of my favorite films.",Eyes Wide Shut
881,coiled,Lost,3,29 December 2005,"The so-called genius of Stanley Kubrick is totally lost on me. I'm pretty sure I'm in minority in my opinion (and it IS only an opinion), but I find his films almost unwatchable. Technically brilliant but cold, unengaging and tightly sealed. Suffocating. I'm sure anyone who took over 12 months to make a film could come up with something passable, and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is barely passable. Would we be talking about this film if it was directed by anyone else? Is it merely the high-budget high-brow version of a direct to video thriller? ""Bedroom Eyes VII: The Masquerade"" perhaps? The sexuality on display is stunningly unerotic, the music score heavy-handed (and caused ripples of laughter amongst the audience when I saw the film), the acting highly variable. Tom Cruise tries too hard as usual, and once again fails to come across as a believable character. Nicole Kidman's scenes at the party that opens the film are frankly awful, but for the remainder of the movie she is remarkable. The climactic orgy features some great Venetian masks but is mind-bogglingly heavy handed in execution... I've tried to justify the turgidness of the experience, thinking it actually tells the story of a man with no sexual imagination. Hence his visions of his wife sleeping with another man are flat and clichéd, his responses to sexual situations are muted and almost coy. But even if that were the case, it doesn't make for an interesting cinematic experience. There's no passion on evidence in this picture, no animal lusts and desires and urges. It's too calculated - nothing is 'felt'. And as a result, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" sags and deflates under the weight of pretension.",Eyes Wide Shut

It shows how inner love/ sexual desires shape up and what they say/ mean/ interpret/ signify.I say this on this movie: 1.> All that glitters is not gold.

884,Corina,Schlock,1,20 July 1999,"Perhaps the worst movie I've ever sat through in a theater, much less paid good money for. Only did it cause I (usually) love Kubrick. Whole thing was overblown, hypocritical, misogynist morality tale that played like a short story lifted from a 1950's issue of Playboy. Sleazy without reason, ridiculous and convoluted, wooden/artificial acting from the two leads, heavy handed atmosphere and redundant themes, all to serve a central plot which was as compelling as a frustrated teenager's diary. Sex, desire, mystery, violent urges, perversion, betrayal, all of these things put in an appearance, some longer than others but all similarly shallow.No beauty, terror, passion, or haunting moods - nothing about Kubrick shone through this mess except some familiar lighting effects and camera uses. Ultimately, this belongs on late night cable next to the rest of the erotic thrillers with artistic pretensions. Most insulting is the consistent masculine reduction of women into whores, as though sexuality still has only one point of view, only one motivating force, and it is Mr. Rich White Male. Marquis de Sade played those same games, but he admitted what he was doing, was conscious of his allocation of power. This movie gives Nicole Kidman a few dramatic, annoying scenes to establish a conflict, but her character is ultimately a nil - the sum of her husband's fantasies and projections. If you're interested in sexual power plays, read Marquis de Sade.

""Last night I almost killed the men that molested my daughter, but today I offer her to you.""  ""My wife thought about having sex with another man, therefore I must purge the images by obsessing about that orgy my piano buddy told me about.""

I thought that Kubrick and the cast would have taken more chances, given the subject matter, but they didn't.  Nicole Kidman did a really good job, but Cruise did not.  He had little change in his acting style from other movies.  His character could have been Jerry Maguire because it was played the same way.  Overall, I was let down by this movie.

The tranquil camera work, the relaxed actors,the use of sex as simile for deceit, The Fidelio scene captures the very essence of the work, a perfect setting for a cinematic metaphor. Behind closed doors,behind a mask, is who you are. IF your looking for a movie go elsewhere, this is an experience,a lesson of life & love, but most of all, the human in us all. We truly go through life with our eyes wide shut. The truth doesn't exist, It's absorbed in who we became, never to be verbalized only thought.So, in closing when you go night, night, tonight.

888,Rogue-4,Limp story-telling wrapped up as semi-intellectual nonsense,1,20 September 1999,"And so the last chapter of the Kubrick enigma is written. Trouble is, the real enigma is why anyone thought there was one to start with.There is a danger that Eyes Wide Shut will become, as Kubrick's last movie and the one he died making, some sort of cinematic Holy Grail, immune to all criticism. But it deserves to be said: this is a bad film. Story is glossed over with ambiguity and characterisation eliminated for, well, nothing in particular.The primary problem is that it is a film lacking in any direction whatsoever - by the mid-way point it could have turned into an excellent thriller, or gone in another direction and been an equally compelling look at the two main character's relationship with each other. Indeed, it spent two hours building up both of these plots, but failed to deliver on either. Instead, it wandered off for the last hour in no particular direction and consistently failed to expand any of its ideas into anything resembling a plot-line, ending with a insultingly limp coda where everything was forgotten, forgiven and plastered over. It is as if halfway through, Kubrick changed his mind about what the film was about and then changed it back again for the last half hour, leaving neither element explored to any great degree.Like most of Kubrick's films, the characters are bland, narrow and un-engaging; Tom Cruise's character bumbles from one unrelated event to the next, purely on the motivation that he feels the need to cheat on his marriage because he misjudged his wife's ability to fantasise. There is no structure to his movements through the film. It's all rather aimless. It's all rather pointless. His breakdown at the end is all the more ridiculous because he didn't actually do anything except spend a hideous amount of money not doing it. If this is an accurate analysis of relationships in the nineties, heaven help us all.The one sub-plot that actually promises to engage any interest - a piano player friend has a job at a party that Cruise contrives to sneak into - is presented in a manner worthy of Hitchcock. The resulting party is suitably weird and has a darkly threatening conclusion. Another twenty minutes are spent turning the screws up a notch or two further. You reach a point where you are genuinely on the edge of your seat and then the whole thing fizzles out, to be left with the feeling that surely that can't be all there is to it? Maybe you have to tune in again next week for the second part...What we are left with is an hour in the middle of the film that was completely unnecessary to the relationship of the two main protagonists, which seems to have been the main point of the film. All it serves is to inject a little weirdness into what would otherwise have been a rather banal story about the sexual jealousies of two spoiled middle-class New Yorkers. But even this isn't taken anywhere really interesting. Instead of seeing the characters under a microscope, you feel as if you watching them from the wrong end of a pair of binoculars. Any interest comes from your own desperate attempts to bring the various plot points together in some sort of cohesion.Most frustratingly, the film is littered with well-rounded, interesting characters and ideas and, like all Kubrick films, is beautifully shot. But this simply isn't enough to make it a compelling piece of cinema. Like 2001, A Clockwork Orange and the second half of Full Metal Jacket, there is no emotional attachment to the subject - everything is presented rather coldly and clinically; even the griminess of the hooker's apartment doesn't feel that grimy. It may as well have been a documentary on fungal nail infection. The wonderful and intriguing characters - the Hungarian playboy, the neurotic and repressed daughter of one of Cruise's patients - are discarded after a single scene each. They are not taken any further. It's all a bit of a cheat, really.Like Peter Selllars in Dr Strangelove, Jack Nicholson in The Shining, or Vincent D'Onforio in Full Metal Jacket, this film needed an actor with enough personal charisma and confidence in himself to still shine through after Kubrick's relentless directorial hammering. Instead, the entire cast go through the motions like clockwork, like someone who has said the same word over and over so many times that it no longer has any relation to its meaning. Two performances leave an impression: Alan Cummings, who has played his role so often he can slip into it effortlessly; the other is from Rade Serbedzija, who hams it up wonderfully. The rest, most disappointingly Sidney Pollack, simply glide through the film, leaving no trace of their passing.It is human nature to try to make sense of something so pointless - let's face it, you've paid your money and you want to know what you've spent it on. The danger is that this excruciatingly blank canvas will become painted over with a lot of semi-intellectual twaddle, as self-appointed interpreters of the film preach to the countless poor souls who sat for two hours wondering when the film was going to start and the third hour in the sinking realisation that it was almost over. To say that you ""get what you put in"", or that ""the pointlessness *is* the point"" is a pathetic apology for a film with no idea what it wants to be.",Eyes Wide Shut
889,filmict,Had different expectations,9,19 July 1999,"Eyes started as a great film and had all the makings of another Kubrick masterpiece, but about halfway through the film, the film sort of changed directions and lost its way.  I guess what I expected from the film was an exploration of the relationship and deception between the couple after their experiences, both real and fantasized.  However, instead of doing that, Kubrick chose to divert the film into almost a suspense thriller.  That remains the biggest disappointment of the film.  You do not want Kubrick to waste his time (and now we will not see any new film from him) making a suspense thriller, and not a good one at that.  He could leave that genre up to the lesser directors.In a film which is supposed to explore the relationship between a couple, one half of the couple, Nicole Kidman, was missing from most of the latter part of the film - except for two or three sequences - which was unfortunate, because she gave a much better performance than her husband. In my opinion, Tom Cruise was a miscast.  It is unfortunate Kubrick could not find anyone better to play Bill Harford.  If Stanley had not been such a recluse, maybe he would have found someone better, rather than rely on his agents.  One could not help notice how much time Tom spent with his face fully or partially - one can understand Kubrick directing him that way to hide the expressions, or the lack thereof, on Tom's face in critical situations.Since he died after doing the first editing draft of the film, the editing also left a lot to be desired.  However, Kubrick's mastery of the art form shows through at many places.  The opening sequence is great, the cinematography, specially the use of colors to depict moods, was excellent. In the first half of the film till the scene of the orgy, you were never in doubt that this was a master at work.",Eyes Wide Shut

892,Les-15,An Ambitious Failure,6,17 July 1999,"It is unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick, one of the few contemporary cinematic masters, failed to leave us with a work properly deserving of its position as his ultimate artistic statement. If Kubrick had not died four days after completing 'Eyes Wide Shut', this eagerly awaited addition to his remarkable roster of films would have suffered the fate of Martin Scorcese's 'After Hours'-  to be first defended, then dismissed as an unsuccessful experiment by a director of genius. The film begins well, immediately seducing the viewer with its visual beauty and leisurely pace. Aided by an appealingly edgy soundtrack, it soon proceeds to constrict itself into a tense knot of psycho-sexual suspense. Whereupon it suddenly loses its way. And stays lost. For a very long time. Following a path from provocative to disturbing to annoying to ludicrous, and finally, to tedious, the film then doggedly stumps on for another 3/4 hour.  While impossible to recommend not seeing it, 'Eyes Wide Shut' leaves little recourse, other than to suggest following its screening with a trip to the video store to check out 'Barry Lyndon', 'Lolita' or 'The Shining'.

894,Kevin-63,Comment of EYES WIDE SHUT,9,2 September 1999,"I read many user comments about EYES WIDE SHUT in this site and found that they are main divided into two groups: 1) Lots of praising words of the film, director and actors; 2) Trashing it by saying it's long, dull and a disappointment.I would never be group (2) because I did not feel bored when I saw this movie. Actually EYES WIDE SHUT is like classical music, some people like it and some people (the majority) don't. The people who do not like it think it's long and boring, people who like it would know how to enjoy every second and every note of this film.There are also many people claiming themselves Mr. Kubrick's fans and are disappointed. They usually compare EYES WIDE SHUT to ""Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb"", ""2001: a space odyssey"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" or even ""Full Metal Jacket"", and then comment on the actors and pace of this film, pretending they are critics or Kubrick expert. The worst thing is, they read the whole original novel the movie based on just to criticize the adaptation.I don't want myself to sound like the group (1) praising guys, but I still have something to say as my defense for Mr. Kubrick.1)  Mr. Cruise did act in this movie. People just love to focus on either his face or charm, and says he's a bad actor. Check out his 'reaction' after being pushed by the kids in the street, the silent (beaten) moment after confessing to his wife, the scene in which he waited outside the gate of that orgy house;2)  The actor mostly 'react' (instead of act) the right way, Alan Cumming's character may be is stereotyped, but didn't you ever see a homosexual person act like this? I did;3)  This is just a reminder, many people think that long night journey of Bill Harford happened right after the party, but the fact is he made love with his wife Alice that night (Chris Issak's Baby Did A Bad, Bad Thing). They had a normal life for just one day, then the grass started it all;4)  The little interesting details like the front page of the newspaper Bill bought, refers to his 'in the line between life and death' (threaten, HIV) situation, and a lot of them which I don't want to spoil it. (For all the people who haven't see the movie yet)After all, what a surprising (-ly light) ending and last word.",Eyes Wide Shut

899,spit,A riveting dive into sexual depravity,10,16 July 1999,"Okay, I'll confess now.  I'm a diehard Kubrick fan.  I knew I was going to like this film before I knew it existed.  Even so, this movie did not disappoint.First off, Cruise and Kidman have the comfortable married thing down cold. Many of the subtleties and nuances in their common discourse may be lost, however, on those without any marital experience.  No one will miss the sexual tension brought on by the first party they attend together (although ""together"" may not be the right word, as they spend nearly every minute of it apart).  Every giggle from Kidman, every smile from Cruise, makes the taboo of marital infidelity so much more real.  Unlike the cartoon characters of soaps, these characters have feelings for each other in addition to the animalistic desires (often for those other than our spouses) that cause Man's ultimate demise.  That love for each other makes the fall all the more traumatic and, in this film, dramatic, as you have little idea what will happen next.After Kidman lights the powderkeg that will become Cruise's decent into sexual depravity, the viewer has to wonder who the victim is here.  Is it the faithful, though flirtatious, wife who merely fantasizes about infidelity?  Or is it the naive, unattentive husband, driven into a libidinous stupor by the vitriolic fantasies to which his wife subjects him? Whomever one chooses, this film takes the viewer on a phantasmagoric journey through the minefield which is human sexuality -- one where not only the flesh of one partner is at stake, but the soul of a marriage as well.",Eyes Wide Shut

And a lot of them just focussed on the sex. But actually the comments had more sex than the movie (what might explain some peoples' disappointment). In fact, Eyes Wide Shut is more about philosophy than about f**king.And because of this deeper intentions all the sex scenes aren't sexy at all, but depressing and oppressive. They might cause strong emotions - but no erections.Finally, a few words about the music and the sound. For the last time Kubrick was playing once again with non-diegetic music. Sometimes you think, that you are no longer able to the apalling piano. But you are. And it's worth it. Every single second.",Eyes Wide Shut

902,kenneweg,A rake of a movie that will leave you with plenty to think about...,8,16 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut  keeps you on your heels and demands your attention throughout the length (2 hours and 45 minutes) of the film.  The plot follows a simple concept: marriage and fidelity.Tom Cruise and his real-life wife play a successful married couple that at first appearance has everything they could possibly desire.  However, under the surface the viewer finds it apparent that this couple is struggling with a marriage that seems to have lost its appeal.  Kidman demonstrates, in startling detail, that she is not perfect wife her husband envisions. With no more than words and insinuation she makes evident that adultery does not require the carnal act of sex, but it is legitimately possible to be unfaithful in mind alone.  Kidman's all-to-honest confession sends Dr. Billy (Cruise) for ride that begins with simple introspection and leads him to the veritable edge.  Our hero, Cruise, becomes involved in an elaborate game of vindication through adultery and deception, and sends our hero to the brink and back.Eyes Wide Shut is visually stunning and it's obvious that Kubrick poured his soul into his final film.  He is a master of leading the viewer through an intricate look into our collective humanity.  You find yourself feeling the pain and paranoia of his characters, and you will question if what you are watching is real or if its is imagined.  Crammed with irony, the story is as abstract as it is simple.  In all, you will enjoy the movie long after you leave the theater.",Eyes Wide Shut

904,Thayli,"Visually interesting, but ultimately disappointing",5,9 May 2000,"I have liked most of Kubrick's movies, so I had high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with most of the film.  I could have forgiven the plodding pace had the plot been more solid.  I could have enjoyed the visual appeal of the film had the dialogue not been so choppy and forced.  I would have applauded his use of sexuality in the film had the movie been remotely sexy (never have so many people bared so much with so little effect).  Most of all, though, I didn't care about any of the characters.  It wasn't just that I didn't really like them, it's that I didn't really care one way or the other for them.Was this film filled with subliminal imagery?  Definitely.  If you're one of those people who like to ponder the meaning of cleverly placed props and what they may mean, you will probably like this movie.  There is a side of me that likes that kind of detail, but I wasn't pulled in enough to care. There are also a lot of weird/quirky characters, which I generally like in a film like this.  But they never seem to move the story forward and they were ultimately wasted.I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but I thought his performance was one of the few high points.  Considering his character was generally restricted to awkward pauses and brooding silence, I thought he was fine.  When Kidman delivered her fantasy monologue I felt like I was watching an audition for a high school production.  Ugh!",Eyes Wide Shut

Nor did the film have a definite middle or predictable end.

I had been anticipating it for about a year now and I am so pleased that I finally got to see it.Kubrick is without a doubt my favorite director and as always he pulls it off and displays his skill brilliantly with his latest offering.Unlike 'The Shining' Kubrick, with 'Eyes wide Shut', well I feel, concentrates more on the story and the film than with his photography, although there are a few memorable shots throughout the film, such as the opening shot of Nicole Kidman. If any of his previous work could be compared to this I would say 'A Clockwork Orange'.I think that you need to watch this film at least twice to properly absorb it and take it all in, at 2 and a half hours it can be pretty heavy going but I found that I didn't look at my watch once.I think that Kubrick fans, critics and film buffs will love this but the general 'block-buster loving' cinema going public will find this film a little different.I absolutely loved this film, and even after a couple of days after seeing it I cant stop thinking about it.

Among the the best was the feeling that I watched an hour and a half movie that was actually more than an hour longer.

Like any truly great artist, Stanley Kubrick, the director, is sometimes hard to keep up with.  The thing with the movie was that it was not very sexual.  Yes, there were lots of naked people, and lots of sex in it.  The majority of these scenes, though, were more scary then sexual.  All the times when you would expect sexuality to emerge, namely all the sex scenes, fear emerged instead because of the way the scenes were set up.  Even the one scene that might have been the closest to sexual was tainted with jealousy rather than sexuality.  It was just amazing.  I HAVE to see it again to catch those things I just didn't catch the first time. This film was, at first glance by a casual observer, EXTREMELY bizarre.

Why he felt the need to invent such a comically contrived plot and setting to examine such a basic and realistic subject -- marital fidelity and its attendant emotional baggage -- is beyond me. Kubrick, who by all accounts was an  isolated and detached man, simply does not seem capable of realistically portraying a marriage in jeopardy.  I have a happy marriage, but something tells me that it would not take 100 millionaires dressed as monks, 50 prostitutes, and a possible murder cover-up for me to realize that the wife and I had difficulties we needed to discuss. Apparently Kubrick felt that that was necessary to get his points across.  Instead of making me think, he made me laugh. Unfortunately, that was probably not his intention.",Eyes Wide Shut

915,Todd M,A fitting farewell to the master,9,18 July 1999,"To all of you out there who are eager to discover the closely guarded plot of Eyes Wide Shut, fear not, for I won't ruin any of it for you. Rather, I will say that you will be seeing a brilliant film, the final work of history's finest film director, Stanley Kubrick.  In an age where so many films are over the top and far-fetched, Eyes Wide Shut takes a long hard look at the taboo of extramarital sexual attraction. In this film, Stanley Kubrick bravely delves into the realm of the taboo as we follow Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) on a journey to discover the part of himself he was afraid to admit existed, his own capacity to fantasize about women other than his wife (Nicole Kidman).  This is not a B-rate T&A film and it's not pornography.  Rather, Eyes Wide Shut is a captivating, and at times deeply troubling, look at human emotions.  The script dynamically juxtaposes the sacred with the taboo, mixing Christian symbols with raw sexuality.  The result is a film which cannot help but make the viewer feel the strength of Cruise's moral conflict. More than anything, Eyes Wide Shut is brutally honest.  Kubrick takes a journey into a man's soul and forces you to join him.  Technically, the film is superb with a score that accentuates the emotion of every frame of film and lighting that creates the ambiance necessary to pull off some of Eyes Wide Shut's most etherial scenes.  Finally, praise to Stanley Kubrick, whose final film, and first in twelve years, shows that he never lost a step in 40 years as a filmmaker.  In the hands of almost any other director, the complex story of Eyes Wide Shut would stand the risk of becoming a pretentious and raunchy diatribe.  But the brilliantly subtle style of Kubrick, it is a masterpiece.",Eyes Wide Shut
916,Amason,BRILLIANT!,9,14 July 2000,"So, I saw this movie at the theater, I didn't know what I should expect, I was open-minded.  The outcome; I really liked it, it was completely perfect! Tom Cruise held this movie at the top all time and Kidman wasn't bad either.  The sound-track is in a way 25% of this movie, it's outstanding, maybe the raw piano is too much, but it gets better the second time you see the movie.  The one-take-shots are pure Kubrick, it gives the movie a special character, as other Kubrick's movies.  I bought the DVD as soon as it hit the stock, and have only watched it two times, it is a true treasure and shouldn't be watched often, once a year is enough.  Maybe the nudity is too much for some people, but it didn't bother me.  The story is very real and works out great with a perfect end. a ""MUST-SEE""!",Eyes Wide Shut
917,sjadc,A great probe into the psychology of sex,8,21 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut is not a movie for everybody. You will either be repulsed or intrigued by its icy exploration of the psychology of sex. There is little middle ground. The movie deals with raw sexual emotions that most people experience but do not want to face. For that it should be praised. It's an adult film dealing with an adult topic, and that is rare in this day and age. In many ways I wish it was rated NC-17; it would label it a serious movie.This movie will be the start for many interesting conversations as movie goers head home. That said, be sure you watch this movie with people you are comfortable talking about sex -- not just locker room talk but real conversations about your sexual desires. This probably isn't a great movie to see with someone you are just starting to date or someone you are just starting to have sex with unless you are ready to deal with some pretty heavy issues.One negative comment... for such a high-profile movie, the numerous editing errors surprised me. I know Kubrick died before he could refine some of the shot sequences, but the errors were pretty noticeable in many cases.",Eyes Wide Shut
918,Quietchu,One of Kubrick's best.,10,22 July 1999,"Wow! Truly a must see! Kubrick's final film delivers an amazingly emotional and psychological experience unlike any film to date. At first glance, the simple plot and lack of dialogue appear to make for a pretty dry movie. Kubrick though, true to form, teases, prods and uneases his viewers through an unbelievably perfect ballet of sight and sound. At some points in the film, the music rips at your nerves with merely a few keys on the piano. At others the music provides an eerie subtlety to the immoral chagrin forced upon the viewer by Kubrick's intense visuals. The dialogue, though scarce, follows the music and imagery in that the viewer becomes entirely enveloped in the emotions that the carefully chosen discourse drags them through, especially during Kidman's monologues. Conversely, Cruise portrays his intensity through painful facial expressions and tortured demeanor. Both hollywood superstars gave an amazing, unique performance, even though this is not a hollywood picture. This is not a Tom Cruise film. This is not a Nicole Kidman film. This is a Stanley Kubrick film. In a better world, this film would steal the academy awards...we shall see.",Eyes Wide Shut
919,filmguy-30,"""What we've got here is a failure to communicate.""",1,17 July 1999,"In ""Cool Hand Luke"" Strother Martin uttered that truly memorable quote ""What we've got here is a failure to communicate.""  Never has that line been more apropos then as applied to Stanley Kubrick's self-indulgent fantasy made public ""Eyes Wide Shut.""Last year, filmgoers were subjected to Terrance Malick's long awaited return in ""A Thin Red Line"".  This year it's Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut.""  We can only guess that something must happen to reclusive directors living in isolation that causes them to lose their once profound ability to communicate with their audiences.In the last year, Malick and Kubrick have each provided us with nearly three hours of screen time filled with memorable, and often haunting, images.  It has been as though their personal dream worlds have been given life through the magic of cinema, and tens of millions of studio dollars.  For at least the last year, many of us have heard reports of how Kubrick subjected his actors to continuous rewrites and reshoots.  We can only presume that these ongoing rewrite and reshoots where were the result of Kubrick's struggle to place a story to the images coming out of his personal dream world, both fantasy and nightmare.We have learned over time that most successful films tap into our society's collective mass consciousness.  Stories are told using a form of logic based upon our collective experiences to which most of us can understand and related.  However, in ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" Kubrick has failed to provide his audience with a story which has the requisite logic to connect his images to a world shared in our collective consciousness.In ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" it is as if Kubrick is telling us a story in a foreign language that we cannot understand.  Imagine Kubrick's photography as the body language of the story-teller.  Although we can understand enough of the body language to appreciate the tone of the story, without understanding the words we have no way of truly understanding the message contained in the story.""Eyes Wide Shut"" drops the filmgoer into Kubrick's reclusive dream world, filled with memorable images of sexual fantasies and ominous nightmares. Unfortunately for us, the story-teller has passed away and there is not a translator in site.  Consequently, the film will likely only make sense to a viewer who lives life, like Kubrick, in their dreams -- with their Eyes Wide Shut.",Eyes Wide Shut
920,ophelia-21,Essential Kubrick,9,20 July 1999,"Okay, so I am fairly dissappointed with IMDb's choice of critc reviews for this film.  It seems to be highly underrated.  Kubrick's genius when it comes to illustrating the darker side of human behavior, is interpreted as dehumanization, when it encompasses the essence of being human.  I would like to ask these critics what ""Mistakes"" this film is full of...Kubrick himself said ""Let the film speak for itself.""  This one does.  It is a fascinating journey, intertwining symbolism, vivid dream-like sequences, a high level of suspense and still maintains a very real message.  The importance of intimacy and communication in marriage would be the theme of Eyes, if you had to pick a theme.  Also is the question: Is fantasizing or thinking about cheating as bad as the act itself?  Or is it worse?  Kidman reaches into her backpack of films to pull out the most intense emotional performance of her life.  And Cruise fits this role like a glove.  His brooding sets the stage, as well as the mood, for the entire film.  Eyes has been added to my ""Greatest Movies Ever Made"" list.",Eyes Wide Shut

Its deliberate - almost languid - pace, contrasted with the overwhelmingly oppressive themes of jealousy and alienation, create a surreal, unsettling balance. Not a film to watch alone, or only once.",Eyes Wide Shut
922,Shimsham-2,This was Stanley Kubrick?,2,19 July 1999,"I have been a fan of Kubrick ever since Dr. Strangelove.  He has always demonstrated the ability to bring his audience into a world full of characters that they may or may not like, with whom they may have very little in common, but always making the characters sympathetic and always framing them in a story that is both fantastic and convincing.
Eyes Wide Shut missed this mark.  I am not sure how much is writing, how much is directing, and how much is editing, but this movie was so disjointed that all credibility evaporated.  The acting, though quite good (well above the weak 'Far and Away' performance I was expecting) was not able to save the film.A brief word about the sex: Unerotic.  As I patiently waited for the big turn on (cf. Lolita), I kept thinking how, with so many naked people on the screen, how difficult it is to make so much sex seem so unsexy.  The actions in the raunchiest of scenes (albeit digitally purified so as to not assault my delicate American sensibilities) seemed overly deliberate.  It was more reminiscent of Cinemax late-night than the raving saturnalia it was meant to be.With little action (events, not nakedness), stunning visuals and characters are what keep me interested.  I have to admit, that for the lion's share of the movie, the colors and sets were gorgeous, with interesting themes in lighting to give a sense of what context the scene held for Dr. Harford. The New York (London) streets were well filmed, but not stunning by any means.  But the characters were left as mere shells with minor motivation and very little in the way of context in the story.  Some of the characters I really wanted to know about (eg. Domino, Nick Nightingale) were completely unexplored.For a long time, I have been pushing the idea of a Dolph Lundgren moment. This is the time in some films where the characters and their actions mean so little, that all I can do is wait for Dolph to bust through a large leaded glass window with grenades in tow, and begin the carnage that will inevitably bring the credits as all the characters are dead. Unfortunately, Dolph was not in the cast.",Eyes Wide Shut
923,SethPalmer,"A masterpiece, fitting of being Kubrick's last gift to society",10,19 July 1999,"The lighting and cinematography was indeed perfection if not above it! Now I understand why Kubrick redid takes 60-70 times. Each shot is as beautiful and well put together as a painting. And the ritual orgy is an amazing, haunting, and utterly classic sequence. When the leader carries the staff and the insence, and sends the masked women off, and that eerie chanting is heard... it sent shivers down my spine. This is a film about the nature of human sexuality, and the nature of relationships and marriage... it made me look at mankind's sexual inherency.... a work of art",Eyes Wide Shut
924,Katzy007,Unwatchable,1,25 July 1999,"Lets be honest and call this movie what it really is. An unwatchable, boring piece of junk.

925,denab,Kidman's superb acting combines with Kubrick's verbally complex screenplay to offer a many-layered analysis of contemporary gender roles.,10,27 July 1999,"Kubrick dares to use long takes, complex dialogue, and subtle motifs to give us a noir ""Scenes from a Marriage"" that comments not only on marital role-playing, but our culture's larger obsession with gender roles, sex, and heroism.  Cruise is impotent through most if not all of the movie, and engages the audience in the titillation of seeing but not touching that characterizes American attitudes toward sex.  He tries to play the hero but cannot, and only Kidman's character (and Pollack's, if we trust him) recognizes the warts on the face of the all-American boy.  Risky business, indeed!  Characters develop and grow deeper and more human before our eyes, amply justifying the danse macabre pace.  And the film's self-referentiality to movie  audience's fascination with nudity, orgiastic sex, and the star power of Kidman and Cruise adds an even richer layer to Kubrick's concoction.  Not his best, but worthy of them.",Eyes Wide Shut

927,FlickGal,Strange and yet extraordinary!,10,23 August 1999,"This movie is one of the ultimate mind games of all time. Although the main theme of this appears to be about sex, it starts to scare you almost half-way through. It takes a turn from sexual drama to psychological thriller. Tom Cruise is a joy to watch, playing a curious and obsessive husband. Although he isn't at his acting best, he still plays the role very well. Nicole Kidman is the real star of this film. She's captivating and you can't take your eyes off of her when she speaks or even just stands there. The intensity that this movie gives off comes from her and she definatelly deserves and Oscar nomination. What makes the movie even stronger is the husband-wife bond of Cruise/Kidman. After viewing the film, you just can't imagine any other Hollywood couple in the roles. And then there's KUBRICK!!! The great length's he went to construct this film are almost insane. Shooting the film from  November 1996 through January 1998. Sending a 2nd unit crew to shoot exteriors of buldings and streets in New York City. Shooting scenes entirely by himself. Re-taking scenes, sometimes 70 times! His vision is great. Great panning shots that are un-broken. Some people say this movie was disappointing.

930,Preston-13,Good thing Kubrick's not around to see the reviews...,4,16 July 1999,"First off, Stanley Kubrick's my favorite.  I don't care what the movie's about or who's in it -- if he directed it, I'm there.Imagine my disappointment in Eyes Wide Shut.Maybe the secrecy was to generate a spectacular opening and then  let the film crash under its own plodding, bland, pointless weight.  There's a lonnnnnng build up to something that never happens.  There's nothing shocking.  There's TV drama dialog.  There's ridiculous people and illogical situations.  The nudity isn't even stimulating.  It's a couple of people whom you think would be interesting, one of whom (Kidman) goes on to live a lifeless two days and the other (Cruise) who drives himself to dabble on the darkside -- without success -- while IMAGINING his wife is cheating on him. ZZZZZZzzzzzzz....I'll admit, I am not a Tom Cruise fan.  I've only liked him in three movies (Risky Business, Top Gun and Jerry Maquire), and in this role, Kubrick apparently told him to act like the self-assured dunce he does in 90 percent of his movies.  He at least could have been made to LOOK like a doctor in this.. and come to think of it, why does he have to flash his doctor credentials like an FBI agent to everyone he meets?I am sorry this marks the end of the life and career of Stanley Kubrick. Think I'll go rent ""Paths of Glory"" or ""Dr. Strangelove"" tonight and try to forget what I just saw.",Eyes Wide Shut
931,gonzo-43,Kubrick's final masterpiece,10,18 July 1999,"EYES WIDE SHUT is Kubrick's final masterpiece. This has been his best cinematic psychology thesis since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I'm pretty confident that any fan of Stanley Kubrick will not be disappointed. It has the basic elements of any of his masterpieces: dark mood, surreal backdrops, violent nature and a psychological lesson to talk amongst the more cerebral moviegoer.First and foremost, the mood ,which is classic Kubrick, is dark and mesmerizing.  From the first shot of Nicole Kidman's naked back, the eyes are drawn into the celluloid screen. His use of neon and city lights only add more to the sexual and dangerous atmosphere that he's created. From the beginning, his camera eye throws the audience into each scene as a vulnerable bystander.Second, the characters have a strong sense of detachment. Where some people may have a problem with this and may be accused of being two-dimensional, Kubrick fans should not be surprised.  The characters in his previous films displayed the same sense of detachment. (History shows that only a handful of actors have been nominated for awards.) And once again, this is all Kubrick.  However, I must note that Nicole Kidman gives her best performance of her career, thus far.And also, the music is top-notch. The piano and strings become the blood stream for the film's intense moments. (Watch out for the music played in the masquerade scene. It literally SCARED me.)I really don't seen any flaws in this picture. Seeing Tom Cruise in such a controversal film does not shock me thanks to his role as a vampire in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. The story was original, creative and as usual he does not provide a ""Hollywood"" ending which is unusual for a summer movie. However, Sidney Polluck's character should have had a surrealistic edge to him.  Something like Peter Sellers in LOLITA. Sidney Polluck acted like...Sidney Polluck.Nevertheless, the wait was worth it.  I realize that there are many negative reviews about it but I believe it's because it's not a ""Hollywood"" movie and also because the movie is different than what most people expected. I think they'll like and accept it after another well-deserved look.One last note:  thank you Mr. Kubrick.  You are an inspiration to those who expect a lot more from the films they enjoy watching.",Eyes Wide Shut
932,Pesto-5,Kubrick's Final Masterpeice is Flawless,10,17 July 1999,"Stanley Kubrick's final film, EYES WIDE SHUT, is a breathtaking story of a marriage plagued by jealousy and a husband seeking revenge.  Tom Cruise shines in his brillant potrayal of Dr. Bil Harford as he searches for answers in a haze of sexual confusion.  Nicole Kidman plays his wife in heartbreaking scenes where she tells Cruise of her fantasies of another man. Some scenes will haunt you, such as the well-publicized orgy scene.  Every moment is flawless.  The acting is fabulous, the scenes are eerie, and you find yourself delving whole-heartedly into the escapades of Harford. EYES WIDE SHUT is characteristically Kubrick, and his final movie is just as good, if not better, than its predecessors.",Eyes Wide Shut
933,wally-55,"A slow beginning, a beautiful middle, but a weak end",7,20 July 1999,"This movie has the feel of not having been completed. There are sub-plots that seem to have been abandoned, questions brought up in the film that go unanswered, and editing that seems sloppy in some places while brilliant in others.Some scenes, such as the one where Cruise walks into the room with the cloaked figures in a circle, seem vintage Kubrick. He captures a surreal view with perfect timing. Other scenes, though, seem poorly shot. The scene in which Kidman starts laughing and drops to the floor, then lays face down on the floor, then sets upright, then lays down again seems markedly ill shot. The camera is in for a close shot on her and follows her down to the floor, it then jerks back up when she sits up, and then follows her back to the floor again. This seems poor camera work. If she is going to flop up and down, the camera should have made a wide shot. If the scene called for a close up, it should have had a cut to Cruise interspersed to avoid having to jerk the camera down, up, and back down again. This was a bad enough shooting sequence that it stood out disturbingly in an otherwise excellent scene. I have seen amateurs with video cameras follow movement more smoothly.The editing also seemed rushed. Several scenes seem to have the film footage of one scene just spliced right on to the end of the footage of the previous scene with no transition footage at all. This may be all right for music videos, but I would expect better editing in a feature film.There are also several subplots that are introduced, developed, then simply dropped. Kidman's dance partner in the party segment has a lot of screen time invested in him with a commiserate interest by the viewer. What happened? This was far too much time to just set up Kidman's view on fidelity. The viewer expects something of this to come back, but nothing ever does. Cruise's pianist friend's fate is never disclosed. A simple call to the West coast would discover if he was sent home, murdered, disappeared, or something. Admittedly he was a minor character, but the audience has some time and interest invested in him and it would like to know his fate. Kubrick doesn't always give answers, but he does give enough information for the viewer to deduce what is going on. Not this time, though. The same could be said of the dead woman from the party. Murder, suicide, accident? Cruise's character is a doctor, it shouldn't be that hard to look for forensic evidence to discover the truth. But the movie is silent on this matter.I have seen nearly all of Kubrick's movies, most of them several times, and this is by far the worst edited and constructed of them all. The subject matter may be in the mind of the characters and actual factual matters don't matter, but it is still disconcerting to the viewer. My personal opinion of this film is that Kubrick himself never finished it. The editing and scene selection seemed very inconsistent with any thing he had done before. The story line seems unfinished with loose ends dangling through out. I think what we have is three fourths of a Kubrick film and one fourth of something else. The recognizable Kubrick parts are brilliant in places, the rest is not.",Eyes Wide Shut
934,filmnuts,Stands up to every Kubrick fan's expectations.,10,14 July 1999,"When compared to such films as Dr. Strangelove, The Shining, or Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut has some great shoes to fill.  Yet, it manages to meet every possible expectation, and then some.  It starts with Dr. Bill Harford, played by Tom Cruise, and his wife Alice Harford, played by Nicole Kidman at an expensive party given by one of their friends.  Each are properly being pursued by attractive members of the opposite sex.  In a later discussion of such matters by the bed, and with a little help from some narcotics, an argument breaks out surrounding the tense subject of sexual fantasy and infidelity.  Upset, by this new information, Bill is exposed to many new and dangerous sexual encounters.  Kubrick takes full artistic license when using a very grainy film stock which gives the film a classic and almost warm feeling.  But once things get a little harry, his tight close ups and slow zooming in adds to the uncomfortable feelings presented on the screen.  Kubrick also uses spectacular lighting, and the sound of a solo piano to deeply intensify every uncomfortable situation. Eyes Wide Shut, though dealing with sexual subject manor, is handled professionally, with a touch of Kubrick just to make everything absolutely perfect.",Eyes Wide Shut

What results is a cold, disturbing look into a disturbed man's psyche.  Cruise plays it cool, as does Kidman.  Which is just right inside the calculated world into which Kubrick has thrust them.

Every scene is massive and compelling.  I never knew Kidman could act this well.  There are no wasted lines or images, everything has meaning.

So he's pretty faithful huh? No he's just lucky. At almost every point in the film, where he is about to enjoy one of these temptresses fate steps in and takes him away.

The critics who rave about this movie are simply praising Kubrick, if anyone else had directed this movie it would have been universally bashed as the awful film it actually is. Fortunately this is America and everyone is entitled to an opinion.

There's not a naked guy in sight, the orgy scene is anything but sexy, the dialogue is forced, and what's with Nicole Kidman's accent lapses?  (She's a good actress but she's no Meryl Streep, and should have been allowed to speak in her native tongue, seeing as how it would have made no difference to the storyline.)  The colour and poignancy of the supporting characters (also beautiful people in ugly situations) is the only redeeming factor here.

This movie was way way way bloated with cliched dialogue, actors hammering out every banal word, zero charisma, and poor characterizations.How much more meaningful it would have been with a normal relaxed human pacing, off-hand unself-conscious line delivery, not so heavy-handed confusion of one ""whore"" with another and a truly meaningfully vested characterization of the wife role.How about a (younger) Annette Bening in the role (?Renee Zellweger)? Give the wife some warmth, a quality of having deep and easy capacity to love and be loved, a genuine emotional involvement as a mother .... instead of a detached neuraesthenic shell.  How interesting it then would have been to see her inability to repress her involuntary fantasies of passionate devastation.  Then we could understand the husband's struggle with her ""dreams.""  Instead we are left to fail making any distinction between an empty wife/mother/lover and the ""whores"" in the night.  Where is the tension?  Where is the struggle for when this man has only half a human soul?  There was no story ... if Cruise's character had any depth to him, as soon as he recovered from the parallax of pot and saw her for what she was, he would have filed for divorce immediately.   EWS misses the point!  How can we be troubled by the lust that threatens substance when there IS NO SUBSTANCE?! All in all, Eyes Wide (Robbed) Blind was an abominable bore, a self-involved little piece of mock manhood obsessed over to the point of cloying involution, an insult to my intelligence, a waste of my time (and I want my money back!)  Stanley Kubrick, a masterful filmmaker, has unfortunately been reduced to a two year-old fascinated with watching his ""duty"" circle the bowl.  How embarrassing that his last airs ... came out the wrong end!",Eyes Wide Shut

I'm going to see it again to make sure I take in more of the details that Kubrick so carefully arranged.  Notice how he gives us a clue to the identity of the Mystery Woman.

It does not give all the answers, which I really like, and leaves space for some fantasy, which is what the film is really about.The story does not want to be true nor event realistic. Journey in the mind of a man:  one night he sees and witnesses different things, the morning after it seems that the photographs of all the places and situations have turned negative and reveal an new reality.The idea of death dominates the whole film, love, sex and jealousy are perceived as ways to be reassured that we are not dead. This is his obsession. You can see it because he seems to keep passive, just watching what is happening. At the beginning, he comes close to seeing Amanda (the party girl) dying, then he is called because one of his patient is dead, whose daughter seems to obsessively desire him. He gives up with the idea of having sex with Domino (the street prostitute) and the day after he finds out she was HIV positive. He meets again Amanda, at the morgue this time.I personally think that close to the end, when he finds his wife asleep close to the mask he was wearing on his pillow, he pictures the representation of his own death, and this is what makes him cry, nothing else.Obsessive score,but it has to be, they are obsessive ideas. Some scenes are a too long, but it is worth seeing a second time to pick more subtleties I presume.This film does not show any splattered blood, dismembered nor disembowelled body, no brain material, no murder, no violence, no situation that could trigger first degree nightmare, sex only between consenting adults. In other words, lots of space for censure.

Sexuality and voyeurism are means to reassured himself that he is still alive. He lives a lot of different seemingly disconnected scenes during the night, and he is so puzzled that the day after he has to visit again into the same places and tries to unravel what happened. Yet, nothing is the same, every scene shows a negative picture like a photograph, revealing a different truth. Which one is the real one?Obsessed and surrounded by death, who crisscrosses his path so often: Mandy (the party girl) almost dies at the beginning; his patient dead lying on his bed and whose daughter declares to him her crazy obsession (what a disturbing, incongruous yet beautiful scene); then Domino the street girl who the morning after discovers is brushed by death (HIV positive); finding again Mandy really dead this time; in the cafe the Mozart Requiem is played. The climax is when he comes back home, and sees the mask on his pillow close to his wife: representation of his own death, he is so shocked that he starts crying; being human, he cannot bear this idea.Obsessive musical score, but the ideas are obsessive, quite well suited.",Eyes Wide Shut

Eyes Wide Shut is lame and sometimes even silly. I've tried afterwards to figure out if I missed something, because so many critics thinks this is a really good movie, but I can only assume that they are blinded by Kubricks name and the ""daring"" performance of the starring actors. Nothing in this movie is thrilling and nothing, except from two scenes, are even interesting. The plot is nonsense - you ask yourself, ""Why does anybody care? What is so 'scary' and 'secret'? Why do these 'strange' men pop up to pass Tom Cruise some notes?"". And so on...

963,m.schultze,two and a half boring hours with plenty glamour nudity,2,22 May 2000,First of all the film is far too long. There are so many redundant scenes with beginnings of stories or plotlines that do not come to an end or just seem to be forgotten. Tom Cruise gives one of his worst actings. His character is very obtuse and is repeating every word that someone speaks to him. One cannot comprehend the danger his character is in and one does not get to know about some helpful backgrounds of the story. Therefore I cannot say what intention the film might have. The only pleasant moments for male viewers are the numerous glamour nude scenes and the sight of plenty implant-free breasts which give the movie an extra point. 2/10,Eyes Wide Shut

I thought the scene where Alice was stoned and talking about her dream was NEVER GOING TO END. Sorry for shouting but I see that this film has 25% of people rating it 10. That's not good, the film is flawed in so may ways (the sex isn't even arousing for instance, and when William breaks down and cries after finding the mask on the pillow you just wish he would grow up) that it's not worth a 10, or even 5, I wished I'd not wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life on this durn rubbish.

I'm not saying he didn't do some great movies but this one was definitely c**p in every measurable way.

Sure if you're gonna compare this piece of work to masterpieces such as, ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" among other brilliant Kubrick works, then of course you will be disappointed by this film. Personally, I just took this film for what it was. A disturbing look at sexuality and the destructive role it can play in relationships.What really impressed me about this picture was the atmosphere and look of each setting in the movie. The most unforgettable sequence for me was the scenes, where Tom Cruise finds himself completely out of place.The music I felt was excellent. I can understand people who criticize it, but I think it fit perfectly with each scene.I agree with a lot of people that the pace to this movie was too slow and maybe the running time also should have been shorter, but in my mind the positive aspects of this film, outweigh the negatives.Overall a good film that I would recommend for anyone to view at least once with an open mind.

972,Peter_North1,No dream is ever just a dream,10,14 November 2007,"""A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.""  Stanley Kubrick What is more frightening, having to wear a mask or what is indeed under that mask? Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick's final and most haunting film is a journey into the mind of a Bill Harford, played by Tom Cruise, who after hearing his wife's fantasy of being with another man sends him into a journey to cheat on her. He roams the streets to escape from his weakness of possibly being undesirable to his wife and along his path is offered sex by a prostitute whom Bill considers in order to get even. There are masks on the wall of her apartment  maybe to show she is more honest about her sexual exploits than the affairs of married couples. She is shown in full view. Most striking is Tom Cruise's transformation into the classic character Dante as he journeys into hell with the aid of Virgil (Sydney Pollack) from the Inferno. Kubrick's use of lighting and cinematography is impeccable as many of the shots are done with a dolly which is one of the hardest to perfect.What separates this film from so many others is its realistic characters. None are overpoweringly heroic or clear protagonists or antagonists. One might view Cruise's Bill Harford as a protagonist and Sydney Pollack's character Victor Ziegler who represents Virgil as the antagonist but that would deny their developed and rounded characters. No one is particularly virtuous or morally devoid. It is more of a difference of levers of morality than simple on and off switches between who is virtuous and who is immoral. The dialog is pleasantly restrained from pretension and theatrics. No snappy one-liners or eloquent speeches are used here. Instead we get real people who talk like we all do. There problems are much deeper and painful though and they stem from moral decay.Bill Harford although being a successful doctor is bored with routine, his wife and lifestyle. Anything different would open his life up. Alice Harford played by Nicole Kidman goes through this tormentous affair as well; she takes care of the kid, cooks dinner and fixes the house. They are comatose in an existence where they both are successful and suppose to be happy. After meeting an old friend from medical school who is now a pianist Bill sees him write a password for a gig he will play at. Bill, intrigued, gets where the location is being played from his weak friend.The next part has Bill enter a mansion that holds a secret ritualistic orgy to initiate new women and entertain the onlookers. Everyone is masked including the sexual participants. The sex scenes in the film are detached, impersonal, cold and clinical. The famous orgy sequence features all masked guests at their party to protect their identities. These men are powerful including politicians, doctors and elite aristocrats. The guests arrive in limos and gain entry to the giant mansion, the password  ""Fidelio."" This scene can be seen as the second layer of hell designated for the lustful according to Dante's Inferno. Virgil (Sydney Pollack) sees him and a woman escorts him and tries to get him to leave because he is in danger. After leaving by being discovered he is called by Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack) mysteriously. He tells Bill that he saw him at the party and the whole thing was a charade.Eyes Wide Shut has Christmas trees in almost every scene. This may be since the Illuminati use a symbol similar to it as seen in the dinner party. It is an eight pointed star with a triangle and circle in the middle that is suppose to be an ""eye."" Christmas is hardly mentioned in the film and it really serves no purpose as a plot point so the Christmas tree is most likely occult symbolism.The main conflict that arises in the film is that of intent and action. Harford intends to cheat on his wife and goes as far as entering a prostitute's room to get even but chance strikes as he suddenly gets a phone call from his wife. Does he not go though with it because he genuinely loves his wife or because fear shakes him in this awkward situation? Alice Harford intended to cheat on the marine at the dinner where she and her husband were but didn't. Are they both repulsive for wanting something but not going through with it? That is up to one's own moral compass. The film is about morality and the sex, power and trust are just tests of how strong one's morality is.The ending shows that after Bill confesses to Alice of where he went and his intentions that there relationship was reduced being just sexual after the trust was gone. This is Kubrick's most haunting film that is expertly crafted and deeply layered. It is one of his best films along with 2001: A Space Odyssey.10/10",Eyes Wide Shut

Bill is shocked and is quiet the phone than rings, he leaves the apartment. that is the start of his sexual journey.The Mask Ball. their is a scene were Bill goes to estate outside New York he gets a password and the address from his friend Nick Nightingale he is playing the plano at the sonata cafe where Bill meets him he is also play the plano that the Mask Ball. Bill than goes to the estate and gives the the password to two men outside the house. He than enters the house and sees what looks like some kind of sexual ritual in front of several onlookers. that was a masterpiece at work. Bill is an approached by a women that warns him to leave he does not. Bill than goes through  several rooms where sex acts are taking place in front of several onlookers those acts can't actually be seen but in the unedited orgy scene which I have seen you can see it. Bill does not belong their the people in the Mask Ball soon find out and is warned that if he said any thing about what he saw some thing bad would happen. what I like about this scene is that Kubrick did not just put sex he made it into art like that sexual ritual,A Mask Bill and the fact that only some people where allowed with the password ""Fidelio."" Bill journey was just getting started. Bill does not tell his wife about that he had seen or were he had been because of what the people at the Mask Ball said. He wonders the streets and goes back to the estate and is warned again to stop what he was doing. He wonders the streets again and sees that he is being followed he later finds out that one of his close friends that he did not know was at the orgy had him followed. His friend said it was for is own good. He is later force to tell is wife about what happened because his wife finds the mask that he wore to the orgy. Kubrick made sex and nudity into art.

I actually watched this movie twice (I know I was crazy to do it) to see if it was just me. Was I missing something? This movie was critically acclaimed so I assumed I had dozed off and missed some magical scene that turned this dismal movie around. But to my dismay I didn't miss anything, this movie is absolutely terrible. The fact that Nicole Kidman partook in this film can only be explained by her dedication to her very disturbed husband, Tom Cruise. We all know he is missing a few cards in his deck from his odd obsession with Scientology. The only thing this movie triumphantly demonstrates is Tom Cruise's inability to act! What is most sad about this entire fiasco is that the respected people in the cinematic world gave this film respectability. Perhaps out of respect for a great director who has now passed on. But from what I know of Mr Kubrick he would have preferred the honesty each and everyone of us has shared in the numerous bad reviews we've posted. To sum it up, trust me, don't waste your time.

975,Franki1,Kubrick goes out on a high with EWS,8,17 October 2001,"Inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle"", Eyes Wide Shut is a film which divides the critics (as it was often the case with all of Kubrick's films): On the one hand you have to admit that the film takes quite a bit of time to get really started.  Referring to the first part of the film as boring is unjustified, but it's certainly not breathtaking in terms of action. You wonder whether this sly storytelling is necessary for the action ahead-and I think it is: When Dr. ""Billy"" is walking down the city streets, wondering if this wife really cheated him, the action slowly gets into flowing. When he gets to the mysterious masquerade-party the excitement created by the strange atmosphere and the unfamiliar piano-playing suggests a feeling of thrill. At the same time we undoubtedly know that we are in a Stanley Kubrick film. You can argue about certain elements in all his films but no director I know is able to create these stunnig pictures which are in an absolute harmony with light and sound. In EWS we have these fantastic masks in various forms and designs and we see how Kubrick displays the perfection of the female beauty. There isn't a lot more to tell even if you might wonder what this film is actually trying to say: Is it philosophically? Is it all about what dreams can do to us or make us believe? Is it simply about Sexuality in a relationship or about sex in general? You have to find out yourself. Kubrick's films have and will always stand out-the one way or the other!",Eyes Wide Shut

Yes, I am aware that it is Kubric, but need I remind everybody that he did die before the end of making this film, and indeed, it shows. The editing is dreadful: it was far too long; they were overindulgent in scene and shot lengths.  And while the sets are lavish and the lighting beautiful it does not make up for a POINTLESS script.  It is a hollow shell of a film, a pretty facade, but scrape past that and you will reveal a void of superficial characterisation, trite dialogue, SHOCKINGLY BAD musical score (c'mon.1 note??), with an inane plot.There is no plot, and the insipid characterisation is only made worse by the shockingly bad acting (I'm sorry, was Kidman laughing or crying???).  I am aware that a good use of the pause can add an element of drama to another wise dull dialogue, but adding it after EVERY WORD makes it boring to watch, and it only resulted in a pathetic attempt to add depth to two shallow characters.  The character's adversity is banal, and it is extremely difficult to muster any concern for anything that befalls them.I am also aware that the film won much acclaim, but I feel that this is misguided plaudit from blinded fans of Kubric.  This is a rotten film, and Kubric fans would be best looking at his better work rather than remembering him for this banal crap.  People put too much emphasis on visuals, forgetting there is supposed to be a point, (remember that thing called the narrative).  This is hardly cinema de look, and even `The Big Blue' had a better plot!If you have not seen this yet, then you are lucky  (in more ways than one) as you are obviously not a die-hard disciple of Kubric, and are therefore not vulnerable to liking a TERRIBLE film.  I feel quite safe in saying that you too, will loathe this film.  Do not waste your time.1/10 (an award I do not bestow often)PS: If you are still gripped with the desire to see this film I recommend watching it in fast forward, you'll adequately get the gist and if you do this with a DVD player you can listen to the dialogue at the pace that most humans speak at.",Eyes Wide Shut

But the truth is that this movie is a masterpiece, if you have seen it and felt like me after I first watched it, I encourage you to go to this website: http://collativelearning.com/EYES%20WIDE%20SHUT%20analysis.html and watch the three part analysis of Stanley Kubrick's final film.There are hidden clues throughout the film that show Kubrick's genius. I still am thinking about all the clues and am positive that I will watch this again to see if I can discover anything else, I am certain I will. Perhaps the most meaningful passage out of the reflection was one of the first sentences, this is when the true brilliance of the film really hit me. ""The foremost unconventional story device used in EWS is dream logic - the simplest clue being that the film is loosely based upon a book called Traumnovelle, which translates as Dream Story. And this is exactly what we get while watching EWS – a story that combines the psychological traits of both dreams and reality  of being simultaneously asleep and awake  Eyes Wide Shut."" -Rob Ager.I cannot stress enough how amazing this movie is. I keep repeating this, but the film is truly a masterpiece, I am sure you will feel the same way once you watch or read the anaylisis.",Eyes Wide Shut
983,hlywdman,A sad bookend for a great Director,2,13 June 2008,"As I read through the comments, I have to wonder what is wrong with movies. When something this enervated gets made and discussed seriously, you want to laugh. But you're too aghast to do that, so you just keep watching. If Kubrick wanted to blow the lid off of sex, he's about forty years late. If he wanted to shock you with the idea that women love sex and fantasize about it, then again, I feel that he must have been locked in an emotional prison the last few decades. As with Full Metal Jacket, the ideas and themes are woefully out of date and overdone by the time Kubrick gets to them. Have you ever seen a movie about sex that showed it so clinically? And for god's sakes, it's supposed to be about a sex club, where is the heat. And then there they are just sparks from earlier movies. When Cruise goes to buy his costume, the shop's daughter is a flirty tease, a new Lolita? It's a yawn. And what of the casting of Cruise and Kidman. Did it add the personal touch that Kubrick was hoping for? I don't think so, because Kidman's character is so brittle and shrill and Cruise is down in the dumps. These two may not sex, but they certainly need some yoga. And if you take it, as some have written here, as some great work of art, what the hell what would you take from that? That sex is universal? That you should never go to a sex club unprepared? There are many moments when laughter is induced due to Kubrick's arch staging. My favorite is when Cruise is constantly being warned that he's in danger. Of course, since both he and the girl warning him, are wearing masks, you don't really catch much emotional weight. But it's funny to listen too the girl just the same.",Eyes Wide Shut
984,chapman_nicholas,Has it started yet?,1,4 November 2002,"I have to say that is the most disappointing film that I have ever seen - yes even more so than Blame It On The Bellboy!  It rates only second to The Blair Witch Project as far as overhyping goes.  The plot was shaky and extraordinarily slow moving (if not non-existent), the characters unbelievable, the acting hammy and laughable and the soundtrack/score (normally very good for Kubrick) a little lacklustre.  It seemed to me to be a vehicle for attractive naked people, which was the only enjoyable aspect of the film.

Tom Cruise's performance it's not that good. He smiles every time without any reason, and well it's not his best performance (see Interview with the vampire). Nicole Kidman's performance is amazing, as she always does. I think she's the best actress I've ever seen. She should give some acting lessons to his ex husband Cruise... just kidding.

It's not suspenseful and long periods of time go by where barely anything happens. The plot is extremely hard to follow as well. As Bill tries to piece everything together the audience is left with increasingly more questions, leading up to a completely anticlimactic and unbelievable conversation at the end in which Ziegler magically explains everything. When I spend the whole movie expecting Bill to dramatically uncover the truth, the last thing I want is a half-assed ""oh, by the way, here are all the answers,"" right before the end. To top it all off, Nicole Kidman's acting job is subpar.",Eyes Wide Shut

It has some good ideas, but the length is a huge problem, The movie is way to long. Another problem is The ending. Which doesn't seem like an ending, I didn't feel closure to the story, what sucks most is that you feel like you wasted almost 3 hours watching it when there really isn't a resolution. Overall Some people will like it, others won't I personally didn't like it but i suggest you see for yourself and decide 5/10",Eyes Wide Shut
989,pencho_2003,Stanley Kubrick's swan song is his best film ever,10,18 June 2005,Stanley Kubrick's swan song is his best movie ever. His exceptional talent creates this masterpiece of all times. However the movie was slipped by the Academy without reason. I really think it deserved to be Best Picture nominated.The music was great. The classical music with those suggesting piano key tones is unique.And the actor playing of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman and Kubrick's direction was was truly memorable. And collecting all these details it is turn out to be 10 out of 10.The movie is beautiful and refined and it is about Freud's psychology which was expressed by Kubrick very slowly and carefully. And the movie is not disgraceful at all.,Eyes Wide Shut
990,musical_notes12,A great movie after 15 years,10,6 September 2014,"This film is a work of genius that, like all Kubric films, is open to many interpretations. The art of this film remains its slow, thoughtful pace, camera angles and distances, facial studies, colour and ingenious set designs. The original music of Jocelyn Pooke provides the necessary extra voice and story that gives this film the unique feel it has. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a study in psychology and nerve, human weakness and how we might overcome those weaknesses.Many interpretations have been given of 'Eyes Wide Shut', and I agree that Kubric invites us to think carefully about his films, offering no definitive answers. However, I offer my own view of what I think is going on with the story of Bill and Alice Harford in this piece of cinema noire. Throughout the film, there are a series of clues dotted around the canvas like a puzzle of separate pieces, and yet bound by a common thread.At the heart of the story are the married couple, Bill and Alice, who have marital problems. Alice, whilst telling of a sexual fantasy, doesn't actually enter into any kind of affair. Bill, jealous of Alice's fantasy, is seen walking into a series of temptations and embracing them. These temptations are rather like those described in the Garden of Eden story with Adam and Eve succumbing to temptation.With Bill, it is his night walking and encounters with women in different situations that present his weaknesses. The one moment in the film that, for me, triggered thoughts about the Genesis story were the words of the masked woman at the hedonistic party who steps in to save Bill, saying she will redeem him. Who might she be to offer redemption? At that moment, the other parts of that central section of the film became clearer. The naked people seen copulating with each other is, for me, humans functioning as they should, to multiply. Naked flesh is not presented so much as erotic but rather as humankind exposed for what it is, as a sexually functioning race.Bill is frail, showing fear as much as pleasure at the encounters he is having with the women he meets. The death of Mandy, a prostitute he first meets at Victor Zeigler's party, is a symbol of how life is. Destroy your body with drugs, and you will eventually die.Life is frail, but we have to be strong and make better decisions, and that is what this film is about. It is brilliant and a great testimony as Stanley Kubric's final film.",Eyes Wide Shut
991,liam-burford-696-576984,Better than I expected,8,27 May 2013,There was a lot of hype surrounding Kubrick when this film was made. Clockwork Orange clearly went for the whole shock value thing and so I thought this film might follow in that shadow. Add to this Tom Cruise's ego and surely....a recipe for disaster? Well...actually no. The relationship on (and off) screen between Cruise and Kidman is obvious from the outset and Kubrick films with a real talent towards a 'fly-on -the-wall' style. The inevitable scenes when they arrive are both erotic and yet extremely awkward. Pleasantly surprised by this film...and yet left wondering....why still rely on the 'shock' factor again. The Shining still easily remains Kubrick's lasting legacy.,Eyes Wide Shut
992,gnome77,Over hyped,3,20 February 2005,"This movie contains big name stars and a big name director, thus it received a lot of media attention at the time of it's release. The content, however, is mind numbingly ridiculous and insulting. The world portrayed in this film either only exists in Kubricks head or is a world not worthy of being recreated on screen. From the opening scene (which I actually liked :)), the movie progressed no further. It is basically a lot of nudity and poor scripting of an even poorer story. I can't even fault the actors because the script they were given would be impossible to do well, that is how bad it is.See it if you must, but you're best bet is to put that two hours of your life to better use.",Eyes Wide Shut

Started watching it and instantly I felt by the way the movie moved that it was done very well.Slow paced, not much verbal explanation,Very similar to well done movies that rely on camera and actor skills in portraying feelings and emotions without much dialogue.Was confused at first,but later understood the common meaning here. More akin to something you may learn or hear from a psychologist or group therapy, Its all about the human need for sex.Of course there is some level of complex social problems that is involved,(but really this is how it is in the real world)But basically it boils down to one thing the rich and powerful and people with status desire the most similar to any level status of humans...and that is sex.The film tries to show some conflict of the Doctor and his personal beliefs of social rights and wrongs but in the end his problems with his wife get down to what is core to their problem....Stress reducing, crazy all out, hormome realeasing, sex that all humans need to have.",Eyes Wide Shut

I have read a million 'interpretations', and a million 'explanations', and they all differ, leaving me even MORE confused. And Nicole?

997,elitecktiel,Kubrick's final masterpiece,9,2 July 2016,"In Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, it explores the themes of infidelity and trust between a married couple, played by Kidman and Cruise. This film is yet another example of the pure genius of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. Like many of his other films, Eyes Wide Shut contains many subtle references that are easy to miss. For this reason, his films should always be viewed more than once to get the full effect. For most of the film, there is a sensible distrust between the couple. They have both had thoughts and experiences with cheating on each other, but it doesn't start to effect their relationship until they begin to talk about it with each other. Prior to learning that his wife, Alice, was at one point attracted to another man, Cruise's character, Bill, would never think about cheating on his wife. Although he clearly had thought about it, it seemed as though he would remain faithful to Alice. The night he finds out she had feelings for another man, the theme of fidelity becomes extremely present in his mind. In the end of the movie, they both decide, whether it was a dream or something they actually did, those feelings only existed during that night. Although the ending seemed unrealistic, I did enjoy seeing the change in Tom Cruise's character after realizing his wife almost cheated on him. In addition to the acting and the plot, this film, like Kubrick's other masterpieces, was beautifully shot. The movie also had a fitting soundtrack. Overall, I was satisfied with this movie as the final film of Stanley Kubrick's career.",Eyes Wide Shut
998,robertgu,Flaccid Little Man,10,3 June 2016,"After completing Stanley Kubrick's last masterpiece I feel compelled to give some sort of explanation of what I had just witnessed after I partook of this mind blowing journey. First we follow a man named Bill (Tom Cruz), and from the very get go we quickly pick up on his inability to perform and throughout his journey his sexual escapades turn out to be one miss after another. His wife even mocks him at one point and tells him that he is blind and cant see the development of a sexual human (both male and female) has made over the course of millions of years of evolution. Bill is comfortable not knowing what he is capable of and when His Wife (Nicole Kidman) tells Bill that she could have had an affair with a military man in the past, and in fact in her mind did have the affair the disbelief was too much for Bill to handle. His Journey he made was one for self discovery and every person he encountered within a single night were all near misses for him. At one point a bully bumped into him and called Bill a name, reminding Bill of the wall that he lives behind and is too afraid to come out from behind. He finally reaches the highest level of depravity and witnesses complete sexual freedom and even at that level he is still unable to perform, he can only witness what everyone can become and he still has to sit on the sidelines. I can go on forever with the many twists that Kubrick captured and the reference to the Secret Organization with the Orgy scene is really a minute part of the story, the deeper underlay of the story is how sometimes it is easier on life just living simply without the knowing of what the world is really like, it can be frustrating not being able to reach that level of performance but at the same time it can be your savior, like not getting HIV from one of his near misses who found out the very next day that she was diagnosed with. I highly recommend this film and I know that I may be a million miles off of the real meaning of this story but this is what I took away from it. Enjoy",Eyes Wide Shut
999,thomaspaton-98923,Very Conflicted,4,8 September 2019,"Kubrick's final cinematic offering is very powerful and intriguing... but a huge disappointment for me personally. Eyes Wide Shut is an intense and steamy chronicle of deception, marriage, and human desire. Eyes Wide Shut is a highly pretentious, morally ambiguous, and an unusually graphic melodrama masquerading as high-art. With grand and intricate architecture, a moody musical score, a lot of slow talking, and purposefully graphic imagery... are all things that took away from this movie being great. The dialogue was well written, but the line-delivery was weak and every sequence was at least twenty minutes too long. This movie was high on my radar list for years... I waited until I felt like I was ready... and I wasn't. Either I wasn't ready (which I'm fine with admitting), or this film is simply a melodramatic bore trying to be something that it's not. The camerawork, the director, and the cast are really the only things this movie has going for it. Without those things, this movie would have been truly awful. I looked deeper into the ideas and themes... thought it was purposefully and forcefully symbolic and painfully pretentious/self-indulgent. I tried seeing the directors vision, somewhat understood it? But was still let down, confused, and very conflicted. Stanley Kubrick didn't have to show such extremely over-acted and steamy love scenes, disturbing sexual content, and an unsettling/moody atmosphere to get his point across... that is, if he had a point. Kubrick is still my all-time favourite director... but this film, this film was a mess.",Eyes Wide Shut

Many people will hate this review because to Stanley Kubrick fan's he could film a dog crapping in the mouth of a bay and they would think it was a brilliant piece of work. In this stupid film After Dr. Bill Hartford's (Tom Cruise) wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), admits to having sexual fantasies about a man she met, Bill becomes obsessed with having a sexual encounter. He discovers an underground sexual group and attends one of their meetings -- and quickly discovers that he is in over his head. This is a 2 1/2 hour boring piece of garbage.

Many people say that the movie ends very awkwardly(including me),
and that is because the actual hole movie had another 21 or 23 minutes to end yet.
And this is not a conspiracy.It is a fact.That being said, the movie would go on by showing Bill Harford's wife being part of the orgy and who were some of the masked guests at that orgy house.

Gah. IMDb insists I compose more but what can you say about a rat? If it looks like a rat and all the other clichés that I need to make to pad this review with - well it simply is a ""rat"".I am sincerely sad that Kubrick decided this was worthy of the last days of his life.

One - Kubrick simply made a movie that didn't work.  Like the father of an ugly child, he sees it as beautiful, but everyone else shutters yet says, ""Yes, what a pretty baby.""  Or two - the importance of something is that it is NOT important.  Like Cruise constantly trying to sway the situation by saying, ""I'm a Doctor!""

1012,weezer-5,A haunting dream of sexual obsession.,10,18 July 1999,"I admit that I'm part of the Kubrick cult(people that follow his movies like a religion), and I was first in line to see this movie.  Being a huge movie fan I've seen a wide variety of movies, and have walked away from them with a wide variety of emotions.  This was the first movie to put me in a trance, or dream, like state.  The way the movie was shot, lighted, and so on gave the feel of a dream (to me at least).  I believe that this feel is just what was needed and what Kubrick wanted.  Everyone has to admit to thinking about the dark side of sex, and I believe that in this movie we see that a person can explore the buried desires of their sexual id and still come away a good person.I'm guessing that this was a very personal movie for Kubrick.  He seemed to take Cruise's character to places that he, personally, wished he could explore.  Places, like a prostitute or an orgy, that he'd like to visit, but not want to stay at very long.Praise has to go to Cruise and Kidman for their performances.  Cruise was able to strip away his movie star veneer that seems to protect him in all of his other movies, and bring through the clouded, tormented, and unsure heart of a jealous man.  Kidman must have known that part of her role was to be eye candy, but she fought through that and gave the movie's best performance.To anyone out there thinking about seeing the movie.....I say go.  Some will hate it and others will love it, but half the fun of the movie lies in the discussions that will blossom from this great movie experience.",Eyes Wide Shut

1014,PTB,The perverts will revolt but the intellectuals will rejoice!,10,16 July 1999,"Kubrick has been making films since the 50's.  He has made two in my lifetime: Full Metal Jacket (1987) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999).  I was only seven when Full Metal Jacket came out and far too young, so it was a huge thrill for me to sit in that dark theatre and watch Kubrick's name appear on the screen.There was far less sex in the movie than I had predicted.  Instead, Kubrick stuck to his reputation of psychological exploration.  Bill Harford, played by Tom Cruise, is the focus of this exploration.  The catalyst is a bold confession by his wife, Alice Harford, about her brief obsession with a sailor.  This launches Cruise into a self-destructive path as he approaches his marriage with unbridled nihilism.Many events follow, the most bizarre being Bill's confrontation with masked nymphomaniacs.  This is really the final sexual event and so brings what I believe to be the conclusion about sex itself.  It does not portray animal sex as funny or beautiful, but instead casts it in the light of a Masonic or Satanic type of ritual.While watching the movie, I could not help but think of Edgar Allen Poe's villain in The Tell-Tale Heart.  Bill Harford is not confused or sex-crazed and he is certainly not stupid.  Bill is an intellectual and approaches all of his situations with that type of arrogance that an intellectual has. Yet, when he sees that mask on his pillow, that's the defining moment, the thundering beat of a heart under the floorboards.  It is then when a previously confident intellectual crumbles under the realization of his own weakness and sexual obsession.  All that time, Bill Harford had walked through his own life with eyes wide shut.I loved this movie.  And that's all I can say.  Those who were waiting for some shocking sexual act in the movie will be severely disappointed.  I don't know if this is his best, but if you are a fan of Kubrick films, you will not be disappointed.",Eyes Wide Shut

While it may begin almost like a cheap porno, there is a story building.  The casual nudity and numerous references to sex is what makes Eyes Wide Shut live.  The story is based on these elements rather than being encompassed by them.  The real story lies within the title.  The idea presented is that of reality vs dreams. Sometimes you can't tell which one is which, often leaving us with our ""eyes wide shut.""  This idea is what gives the movie its ""haunting"" feeling.

Stanley Kubrick has blessed us with many great films, Eyes Wide Shut being his last.""masterpiece"" - Absolutely.  This is the only word in any language that can successfully describe Eyes Wide Shut.  Everyone gets something out of this movie.  However, there is no true way to describe it... it must be seen to truly understand.So now after all of this, you may be wondering why I only gave it a 9/10 and not a 10?  Simple.  There is no such thing as a 10.  A 10 is a movie that holds the key to life itself or something equally important.So there you have it.  My review of Eyes Wide Shut.",Eyes Wide Shut
1016,Striggy,"He Made a Bad, Bad Film",1,18 July 1999,"Chris Isaak on the soundtrack notwithstanding, this movie was utter dreck. I went expecting intrigue, suspense, threatening eroticism ... what I got was 2 hours and 40 minutes of yakkety yak yak yakkin'!  Shoulda called it ""Mouths Wide Open"".  There was plenty of talky buildup, but never the big emotional payoff (like in ""A Clockwork Orange"", when Alex is able to listen to ""lovely, lovely Ludwig van"" without getting sick any more and he knows he is cured).  Nope, no such luck here.  There's a saying that sometimes people are ""better off dead"".  Perhaps, if this was his future in filmmaking, Kubrick IS better off dead.",Eyes Wide Shut
1017,PJB-7,A misunderstood masterpiece.,10,1 April 2000,"Like so many, I was swept up by the pre-release hysterics: The sex! The secrecy! The stars! The censorship! Fortunately, I forgot about all of that when the opening credits began, and I was able to appreciate its intricate story, its rich look and feel, its astonishing performances, and the genius of its director. Kubrick's swan song is an incredible journey into the psyche's darkest places--a terrain he knew well. It is a gutsy, dream-like ride to the outer edges of jealousy and obsession, a fitting farewell from a director who was called a recluse but always had perfect pitch for the human condition.",Eyes Wide Shut
1018,toeknee-3,Better Title...Save Your Money!,1,18 July 1999,"This movie started nowhere and went nowhere. It was very slow, extremely boring and didn't make sense. One minute Tom Cruise had all the faith in his wife's commitment to the marriage. The next minute he's looking for love in all the wrong places. The adventures of this search was disjointed and senseless. I have not contemplated leaving a movie early in many years but I almost walked out of this one 3 times. The only thing that kept me there was curiosity. Unfortunately it didn't pay off. I could have left and not missed a thing. Not even worth renting. This is unfortunate because the acting was good. This is nothing like a clockwork orange. My partner said she would rather stick cocktail forks in her eyes then see this movie again. Personally I'll stick with butter knives. By the way...I like Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.",Eyes Wide Shut
1019,Ryan-18-2,"Negative, Degrading Remarks",1,18 July 1999,"I was totally disappointed after seeing this movie.  For months, the rumors had led me to believe that the film was about two therapists struggling with their married life.  Even when I realized this was not the case, the plot was horrible.  Nicole and Tom were rarely on screen together, which was a major reason I wanted to see the movie.  And more importantly, none of the major characters ever had sex!  Both of their characters were extremely dull and one-sided--Tom always in a sexual daze, and Nicole crying or high on some drug.  And the dialogue was just one ""dramatic"" pause after another! The plot did offer one flash of hope, though.  A particular scene with Tom at the orgy was very tense and frightening, but the story was downhill from there.  I did not care what happened to the characters, and the ending was cheesy and very deliberate and, worse, left the viewer unsatisfied.  To anyone even slightly interested, it is not worth the 160+ minutes.  See Lake Placid.",Eyes Wide Shut
1020,marcle,A masterpiece from one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century!,10,30 July 1999,"Too be perfectly honest, I was a little worried about this film before it came out.  I have felt that the most recent Kubrick films haven't been Kubrick films at all. The Shining was just a simple every day horror film. Back in the day when I first heard that Stanley was making a horror film I expected something like THE EXORCIST, but no such luck just an insane killer film. Full Metal Jacket was a little closer to home but the comic relief should not be in a war film.  One of the could be best scenes of the movie was ruined when he had the platoon, who were positioned in the trench, deliver corny one liners to the panning camera. Yet Eyes Wide Shut was Kubricks best work since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, in fact I liked it better.  This is a masterpiece. One of the only films this decade to tackle important topics such as marital sex and betrayal.  It should be entitled EYES WIDE SHUT: a sexual odyssey.  The acting was fantastic as well as the cinematography, and the ending discussion about their experiences is moving and wonderful.  I think KUBRICK finished on a great note!  His best film was 2001.  Next was Dr. Strangelove. and in a close bronze is EYES WIDE SHUT! The best film of the year!-Johnny",Eyes Wide Shut
1021,bgreen88,A Brilliant Work.,9,25 July 1999,"What a fascinating -- and challenging -- film!  As with the best of his works, Kubrick combines a thought-provoking plot with a series of unsurpassed visual and musical touches, perfectly accompanying and, thus, augmenting the basic story.  In cases such as this, the end product IS greater than the sum of its parts.  Further, the performances here, particularly that of Tom Cruise, are some of the best of Kubrick's entire oeuvre.  An acclaimed actor (either Spencer Tracy or Laurence Olivier, I can't remember) once described the art of acting as consisting primarily of *reacting.*  As with ""Full Metal Jacket,"" where the audience experiences the film mainly as a series of actions in which the journalist Sgt. Joker participates, and therefore observes, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" can be seen as an extended dreamlike/nightmarish scenario through which the Cruise character, and, so, the audience, moves.  This is an engaging work, one worthy of the characterization ""a brilliant final legacy.""",Eyes Wide Shut
1022,khadford,I wish they were shut.,1,19 July 1999,"I regret my decision to stick with this movie beyond its slow beginning. The characters' motivation was completely irrational, unbelievable and left me unsympathetic with everyone shown.  This movie could have been a psychological thriller, or a steamy sexual adventure.  Instead it's a baffling depiction of random actions by people we just don't care about. Kubrick has produced some masterworks, but it's an error to add this film to that list.",Eyes Wide Shut

I really liked the movie in general but there were things I did not like. It was a very slow movie, the picture was annoyingly grainy and the nudity was your typical gender biased.",Eyes Wide Shut
1024,McKinley,PURE GARBAGE,1,23 July 1999,"If Stanley Kubrick's name was not attached to this bloated pile of crap, everyone would see it for what it really is.  And what it really is is a poorly executed erotic thriller that should have premiered on Cinemax and starred Jeff Conaway and Julie Strain. Get Gregory Hippolyte to direct and keep it at 90 minutes and it may have been watchable, but as it stands, this movie has NO character development, is unrealistic in the worst way, and has some of the worst acting you'll ever see.",Eyes Wide Shut
1025,Alanosaur,Dramatic and Thrilling Masterpiece,10,20 July 1999,"""Eyes Wide Shut"", is a haunting and chilling suspense masterpiece.  This tale of jealousy and sexual desire is classic Kubrick at its best.  The combination of music and imagery creates the film's dramatic flare and sets the stage for one of Cruise and Kidman's finest performances.  Although one scene loses dramatic effect due to Hollywood's editing intervention, it still retains most of its effect leaving little lost.  Sadly this was Stanley Kubrick's final film, but it certainly ranks among one of his finest creations ever.",Eyes Wide Shut
1026,Pixiechick,Great movie filled with ambiguity,10,17 July 1999,"This film is a perfect example of Stanley Kubrick's greatness.  The isolation, coldness, and methodicality of the characters draws you in yet seperates you. I love the ambiguity of the story. You never know what is real, fantasy, or dream. This is a excellent example of psychoanalytic film that you cannot just see once.",Eyes Wide Shut

If not - just ignore the hype and all these reviews, and go see it for yourself, with your eyes wide open.I have but one question to ask:  What kind of country can America be if it cut scenes from this movie??  Friends and I have spent hours trying to work out which scenes the American censors found offensive, and we can't!  This was not a sexually explicit, nor sexually gratuitous film.  I feel sorry for those who couldn't see this movie as Kubrick intended it.For the greater majority of the world though - wasn't that an overall excellent film?!",Eyes Wide Shut

If you are only to go for one scene - go for Nicole Kidman's enrapturing monologue retelling when she almost cheated on her husband. Amazing. Kubrick always manages to pull interesting performances out of actors. Visually this movie is stunning. Go along for the ride, put preconceived notions aside and enjoy!",Eyes Wide Shut
1029,Kilgoer,Eyes Wide Open... Shut... it doesn't matter.,1,21 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut:This may be the worst movie I have ever seen. It is certainly the worst since ID4, which was of course and entirely different awful movie.I have no idea where they got this terrible idea, well I do, it was from a novel of the same name by Arthur Schnitzler who died in 1931. So this is not a new book, also Stanley Kubrick was so out of touch with what has been going on that the plot of this movie would have been dated in 1970.
The so called sex scenes were like something 6th grade boys imagine sex to be like. They were not sexy or ""turn on's"" they were hysterical.The pace of this lugubrious movie was so slow I thought I had stumbled into the Slow Talkers Of America Convention.  I cannot imagine how a dynamic actor of Tom Cruise's skill could even begin to slow down like this... it was if he were treading water the entire movie.The sound track music was so terrible that I thought I was going to vomit at one point, make that several points, in the film.  I actually got up and left the little cinema to go find out how-much-longer this travesty was going to last... only 20 more minutes. I went back in and squirmed it out.I give it a minus two (-2) on a scale of one to five.",Eyes Wide Shut
1030,script-3,100% Kubrick ??,9,28 July 1999,"I have seen this movie four times and I have some questions that I want to share with all of you.First, How is it possible that EWS contains a scene where you can see a man of the crew ? Almost 3 years on the making and Kubrick didnt notice that particular scene ? The most perfectionist director ever doing an amateur error ? How is that possible ? On the other hand, EWS is the worst edited Kubrick movie ever. Stanley Kubrick, the man who said that ""editing was the most important part of the filmmaking process"" ends his career with a movie that looks like a set of patches? It is hard to believe that EWS is a 100% Kubrick movie. We'll never know.",Eyes Wide Shut
1031,gossboy,A fitting epitaph for a brilliant career,8,17 July 1999,"If you're looking for a brilliant art piece of cinema, it will definitely more than fulfill your desires.  it is very well shot, with oh-so-artistic grainy film and lots of incredible visuals.  If you're looking for plot, it may or may not have one.  it's not so obvious, but you can play it in your head after it's over and figure it out.  it doesn't outright ever give a reasoning for any of the incidents or actions, and they're not so obvious that you'd pick it up while watching for the first time.  if you're looking for resolution, go elsewhere. not much changes over the course of three days (movie time) or 2:50 (real time).  maybe a little peace of mind for the main characters, but that's about it.  their lives aren't any better off, nor is there some incredible climax or mind-shattering event.  if you're looking for tom cruise, it's here, in abundance.  the same can't be said for nicole kidman (a much better actor), nor any of the other minor characters.  there are parts that will chill you (the ritual scene), parts that will make you laugh (little quips from kidman towards cruise, mostly in the beginning), and of course you will get your fill of nudity and sex.  the movie is very long and slowly paced (almost 3 hours), but I didn't feel bored at any time, and I also found myself wanting more at the end, just because it was very pretty to watch.  character development was also very slow, and you really didn't get an idea of how these people were until late in the movie. the only character who has a lot of development is cruise's, but you at least get a hint of other characters.  my only complaint with the movie is that although artistically, it's every bit ""2001"", it doesn't make the impact that kubrick's other films have.  if this was a film by anyone else (barring other masters such as Scorcese, Lynch or Spielberg) it would be a masterpiece.  Kubrick probably couldn't have directed the movie any better (it's incredible, believe me), but the story itself is at fault for the shortcomings of the movie.  I give it 4 stars for art, 3 stars overall.",Eyes Wide Shut

Mixed comments have emerged since the release of his latest film ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  I believe the story unfolded at the right pace and at the right time, revealing the information needed to the viewer to assimilate the nature of this Film.  The cinematography was impeccable so was the acting. Much of the natural light was used without the need of extra lights on the set, therefore creating a much more natural look of the ambient, even if I believe a faster film stock had to be used to achieve this and so more grainy.  If you are a Stanley Kubrick fan I believe you will like and understand this film, if you are not, this film will give you the opportunity to understand why Mr.Kubrick was so unique.",Eyes Wide Shut

1036,Morphues,Psychologically Spell Bounding,10,16 July 1999,"This film excels at developing the mind of its characters with regard to; sex, fidelity and honesty.  The slow pace served very well to allow the audience to get into Cruise and Kidman's head and realize what they were going through.  The head games were serviced by the plot and communicated by the superb music.  Naturally the key scene for myself was the interrogation of Dr. Harford.  The combination of drama and music, mostly accomplished without facial expression, was exquisite.What will be disappointing to people who go to this movie, expecting lots of sex, will be woefully disappointed.  The tense tone of the film prevent much, if any titillation.Finally as a 16 year old who got into this movie by virtue of my elder looks, I think it's really sad that our society has such a puritanical view toward sex.  There are many other intelligent young people that will be denied this film experience for many years, unless they break the rules, and that's just not fair.",Eyes Wide Shut

1038,Chazzy-2,A dissapointing two hours and thirty-nine minutes.,3,20 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut was a huge letdown, when compared to Kubrick's other films. I was lucky enough to see this film during a early screening so i did not have to pay the seven dollars it would normally cost to see a movie. I would not even pay the couple dollars it would cost to rent Eyes Wide Shut.Eyes Wide Shut is being billed as a steamy love story between Kidman and Cruise and as Kubrick's last masterpiece. It is neither. Yea there are some romantic encounters between Cruise and Kidman but they are done in the first twenty minutes of the movie. True this is the late Kubrick's last film, but it falls well short of a masterpiece. The last two plus hours of Eyes Wide Shut shows Kidman and Cruise crying to each other. There are reasons to become a little upset but there is nothing in the film that should cause such crying fits as Cruise and Kidman display.There are more deadspots in this movie than in all the documentaries made in 1999. Many of the shots in the movie have no bearing on the plot and could be shortened and/or cut out completely. The last two hours of Eyes Wide Shut could easily be condensed into an hour and lose none of it's supposed thrill.",Eyes Wide Shut

Kubrick excelled (again) using a few piano notes, and sometimes even ONE single piano note to stun the audience and to deliver his message.

From the imagery of the eyes (the closeups, tiredness etc) to the slow still suspense of what some critics call the slow part. That slow part was part of what made the movie. It helped build the suspense, even when there shouldnt be any. I think this was one of Kubricks finest of which the ones ive seen and ive see near all of them (clockwork, full metal, 2001 {shoulda payed better attention, but I purchased the VHS Kubrick collection today and have the dvd widescreen neither ive seen YET :)} The Shining, Dr Stragelove, and I havent yet finished Lolita.......) but as with all kubrick movies u need to view them more than once to get the full effect....",Eyes Wide Shut

Every shot in this movie belongs to Kubrick- the atmosphere, the sets, the psychology. A few things nag, however, at what the film might have been if Kubrick were still alive. The digital alterations during the ""Orgy"" sequence, while not disruptive, have corrupted the director's vision. The Studio's decision to add these images has betrayed the viewers and the very principle Kubrick worked his whole life to convey. This, and the shoebox ending, are possibly its only flaws.

I felt that the only thing missing were animals. The only redeemable feature about this movie was Kidman who is again proving herself to be a class A actress.

This movie was fascinating.  With great performances from Kidman and, especially, Cruise, EWS had me captivated throughout.  In his classic style, Kubrick explored a universe he had yet to enter: sex & fantasy.  And he did it his way.  With the slow, deliberate scenes and shots,  the unbelievable fantasy world mansion scenes, and the chilling background music, it was classic Kubrick.  His truest fans will appreciate the hints of past works like 'The Shining' and 'A Clockwork Orange', and they will be left to wonder what could have been if The Great Kubrick were still with us.

1051,barryc-3,Going nowhere...slowly.,1,26 July 1999,"**** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ****I sat down to this movie thinking I would see an extremely intelligent movie with a complex plot and well developed characters.  I was wrong.  This movie gets started in one direction, and then proceeds to dance around in place while nothing important happens.I felt that I could have left the movie, walked around the lobby for an hour, returned and have missed nothing at all.The movie opens at a party hosted by Victor Ziegler (Sydney  Pollack). Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) and Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) are introduced as a couple who in the company  of others who are a bit more affluent then themselves.   Apparently, Bill is friends with Victor and gets invited to these parties every year.  We never learn how or why Victor and Bill are friends.We do learn that Bill is in fact a doctor who's not a jealous man until his wife tells him that she had a fantasy once  about being with another man she saw.  Then Bill decides it's time to roam the streets and encounter every sexually skewed person on the planet as he tries desperately to cheat on his wife.  You don't learn much else about Bill except that he did in fact go to medical school, as evidenced by the fact that he runs into an old friend from med-school who dropped out.  His friend, Nick Nightengale, is not developed much either.Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) plays opposite Cruise as his wife.  We never learn much about her either, except that she's a flirt when she's drunk, she likes to smoke weed, and she's really upset that her husband doesn't think that she would  cheat on him.  Oh yeah, there is some mentioned interest in art and I think we see her looking through the want ads for  a job once.The two have a daughter in the movie who's only purpose is to  prove to you that Bill and Alice have actually been  married for the stated nine years without having to actually explain any of their past.  In fact, we learn nothing about their relationship whatsover.  Keep in mind, that their relationship is the supposed crux of this movie.  The ""climax"" of the movie is when Bill ends up at a secret sex party where everyone is masked and cloaked.  He is immeadiately recognized by a hooker who he had briefly helped the night before when she was drunk and high on heroin and cocaine. How she recognized Bill through his cloak and mask despite only have met him once in an extremely foggy (near-overdose) state is beyond me.  Eventually, his true identity is exposed at the party and Bill's life may be in  danger (you're not sure because you never told who's at the party and what their capable of).  The hooker comes to Bill's rescue and sacrifices herself for his sake.  The climax is later undone as Victor explains that the whole identity exposing, life-threatening scene may have in fact been staged just to scare him.  You never learn one way or the other what the truth is.The movie has a fitting ending as Bill ends up confessing all that has transposed to Alice and she tells him that they  need to ""f*ck"". This was one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. Even if you are curious about this movie, I urge you to save your money.",Eyes Wide Shut
1052,Dan S,Unfortunate Legacy for a Great Movie Maker,3,3 April 2000,"I am a great fan of Kubrick.  His movies are timeless and courageous, but this one just didn't work.  It was, in a word, lame.  As a dark fantasy it did not disturb, as a comment on life it did not convince.  Tom Cruise seemed uncomfortable and out of his element, perhaps he's not ready to grow up and act in mature adult roles.  Some of Kidman's worst work, and I believe she is a tremendously talented actress, she was better and more appealing in Batman.  Too bad she allowed Kubrick to sell out her stunning physical features rather than utilise her acting ability.  I would have expected more from both of them.Perhaps, also, it was also a poor choice of material.  I know that Kubrick has had the rights to this book for quite a while, should have kept them a little bit longer.   There was nothing in the way of revelation about the conflict the characters were faced with.  We all deal with temptation every day.  However the characters reaction was almost cartoonish - something one would find in a TV sitcom, but with an attempt to be dark.  I never bought that the Cruise character was ever in any danger, and never empathised with his plight.  The Michael Douglas movie, The gGe, did what this movie was trying to do with much greater effect - the entering of a surreal world where one's most basic values and character are tested.  The Cruise character survived (morally) by pure luck and not due to any inner strength. He was nothing more than a hypocrite that got lucky in the end and the last line of the movie was nothing short of stupid.Dr. Strangelove, Clockwork Orange, the Shining, 2001, etc.  These will live forever.I'm afraid many of the other commentors here have their eyes wide shut to this movie, and are voting for Kubrick's legacy.

1054,MovieGuy-39,Hypnotic spiral of erotic dread.,10,16 July 1999,"Kubrick attains the apex of a style he helped create-- a brooding, dreamlike cinema with just enough grounding in reality to make its descent all the more disturbing. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a film that penetrates internal mysteries without explaining them; like ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" it refuses to make any sort of conventional sense. It raises the sort and quality of questions that it would not presume to be able to answer. I found myself thinking of Kieslowski's Three Colors Trilogy-- at the end of their lives, Kubrick and Kieslowski both found everyday existence ephemera, and the mystery supreme.",Eyes Wide Shut
1055,Skronek,Excellent acting but left me wondering isn't there more to this?,7,19 July 1999,"Let me say this.  I think the acting was excellent.  Especially Nicole. The scene where the couple is talking about the differences between men and women is fantastic.  I felt it was right on the mark.
I thought the story flondered a bit.  It never really tied things up. I dont think that Stanley Kubrick's point was clear.  During the movie I kept thinking..there has got to me more to this. I found myself waiting to get to the heart of the story.  I really wanted to get pulled in. I wanted and expected the line between me the movie goer and the characters  in the movie to disolve. It never did really. I was always a movie goer watching a movie.
As a married person, I was surprised at the lack of depth and insight this movie had.  I was expecting to be able to relate to this movie much more. If insight and depth is what your looking for, skip this move and go for a long walk with your spouce or significant other.  You will most likely get much more out of the nearly 3 hour experience.I did love the use of color and scenery in this movie.  I also loved way that the music was used in this movie.I think this movie is worthy to see but I would be shocked if after the initial excitement of this movie faded, that people would consider it one of the summers must see movies.  It isn't.  I could have waited for the video. In hindsight, that may be the optimal way to view this movie.  You then could go back and rewatch it and look for some of the answers to your questions that will undoubtably be left in your mind.",Eyes Wide Shut
1056,lift01,Stanley Kubrick's finest work yet!,10,21 July 1999,Eyes Wide Shut is a refreshing breath of fresh air in a summer full of blockbuster-type films. Kubrick's attention to detail and the overall atmosphere of the film is amazing. The vibrant colors and the landscape of a transformed downtown London makes it pretty hard to believe that it is indeed New York City. The storytelling is so refined that Kubrick has taken a classic novel and recreated it in an authentic manner.,Eyes Wide Shut
1057,scott308,Could barely keep my eyes open.,3,17 July 1999,"I did not care for this movie as much as I had hoped I would have.  It tended to drag too often and did not hold my interest throughout. I thought that the film relied heavily on a highly improbable series of events occurring, and I just did not believe they would fall in line like they did. I really wanted to like this movie, but in the end could only give it a four out of ten.  It had some good parts, but I thought it could have been a little more coherent in places.  I really didn't understand Tom Cruise's character's motivation for his trip through the sexual underbelly of New York.  He never seemed to enjoy himself, and I wondered why he kept pressing onward.",Eyes Wide Shut

I avoided the previews and plot outlines so I could judge for myself the quality of the movie.  Few times does a movie come along that evokes such emotion.  I'm talking suspense.  Being scared of what might happen next and letting your imagination run away with you is half the fun of seeing this film.,Eyes Wide Shut
1059,perkij,Could it BE any slower,4,17 August 1999,"Wait for the video.C'mon, if it wasn't for Kubrick' name this movie would be a flop.  Way too slowly paced (even for those with a good attention spans) and it left too many unanswered questions.There was definitely potential in the script but it mostly went unexplored. It almost seems like he couldn't decide between making a XXX movie with a good story line or an R rated film with a lot of sex.  The only problem was there was not enough sex for a XXX movie and not enough story for an R.Don't even get me started on that 'minimalist' piano score throughout the film, I was very over it after an hour by which time it just grated. (Although I will say that the cinema we saw it in seemed to have the volume turned up a bit too far which didn't really help the situation).  I will say that the lighting and camera work was a nice change compared to the majority of films that come out these days.I know he's dead, but even so what's the point in glorifying this film.  He had a great career.  Even the reviews I read beforehand gave it a high rating but they didn't really rave about it, I got the feeling that they felt as though they should give it a good rating.  Get over it, call a flop a flop, he's allowed at least one isn't he ?",Eyes Wide Shut

The 3 hours I spent in my seat were definitely worth it and I don't mean for the nudity.",Eyes Wide Shut
1061,ciboreum,"I love my wife, I love my wife, I love my wife...",10,16 August 1999,"Nicole Kidman is brilliant as a woman who finds her self apart from her ""idea"" of herself. Tom Cruise is heart-rending as a doctor who never (before) felt his alienation from all men, until he feels his love for his wife. Kubrick certainly doesn't spoon feed this tale to us- he inserts it in our unconscious, let's us go out to dinner ,go to work, and play his movie in our minds.",Eyes Wide Shut
1062,LionTx,"Pure Kubrick, mysterious and clever",8,29 July 1999,"Of course it's not a soft porn, even though we are blessed with the sight of Nicole's somewhat thin behind in the opening seconds of the movie.But, to tell the truth, I wasn't sure myself what this movie was until the unexpected turn it took in the middle part. It was too weird to believe, but whoever thought old Stan went crazy, soon was proven wrong. Nothing happened by accident in any of his movies, and EWS is not an exception. Yes, the scene in the mansion is weird enough, even with computer generated deceivers of our sex-lusted eyes. But what was it actually? Was it Tom's reality, or just Nicole's dream? You want answers from Kubrick? Not likely.He's neither your moralistic Spielberg nor entertaining Sonnenfeld. Not even your relaxed but crisp Scorsese. Stan wants to make you think, come up with your own answers. And if at first you don't succeed, you are probably asking the wrong questions. There is no point in telling the story of the movie here, but I have to give kudos to the actors. I already heard the Oscar-buzz for Kidman, whose role is second in importance, but first in intensity. The real gem is the performance of Sydney Pollack as ridicilously rich and amoral friend of Cruise's. He's not in the movie for long, but he leaves a strong impression, as well as Rade Serbedzija. He plays the weird immigrant owner of the costume shop, and I felt kind of proud to have known his brilliant work for 20 yrs before he was discovered by American audience (he also played in ""Saint""). And, of course, there is Tom Cruise, who was not able to impress me in ""The Firm"", ""Rain Man"" or ""Born On the Fourth Of July"". But under steady guiding hand of Stanley Kubrick, he came so close. The transformation and the development of his character is very detailed and accurate, and he was able to carry the movie till the surprising end. And last but not least, this movie speaks volumes about the talents and visions of Stanley Kubrick himself. The grainy quality of the celluloid tape, gold and red colour filters, endless sequences without dialogue, bizarre settings, everything bears a visible Kubrick mark. Not to forget Gyorgy Ligeti, whose mysterious music can be found in two other Kubrick's masterpieces, ""2001"" and ""The Shining"". Whether the anemic Oscars acknowledge EWS as a true masterpiece, it will remain as a worthy ending to a brilliant career of one of the best directors in Hollywood history.",Eyes Wide Shut
1063,Metalman-2,"A strong film, but not Kubrick's best.",8,16 July 1999,"Dr. Bill Hartford and his wife Alice seem to have it all, a posh apartment on central park west, a cute kid, and a kinky sex life, but one night, when Bill learns that his wife has had thoughts about another man, he takes to the streets of New York and runs into one unsuccessful sexual interlude after another until he finds himself at a top secret orgy for the rich and famous.  This is where the movie take a suspenseful twist, similar to ""The Game.""  Of course the movie is skillfully directed by God, I mean Kubrick, and the entire cast gives a great performance, but the ending made me feel as if I had been cheated.  It felt like Kubrick made a last ditch effort to wrap everything up into a neat little package.  I recommend this flick nonetheless, just don't be surprised if it doesn't live up to The Shining, or 2001.",Eyes Wide Shut

Some of the conversations could have been done in much shorter time. There were too many holes in the movie and the characters actions and reactions were often not making sense. I know that Stanley Kubrick's films are as much for the mind as for the eyes, but my mind was not stimulated during periods of boredom. There was also way too much hype for this movie.

The movie is overly long depicting a story that is overly strange.  A lot of smoke and no fire.  The movie appears to be an excuse for Kubrick to depict naked women and that's about it.

All of his movies have been extremely exciting and they only get better with each viewing.  Eyes Wide Shut is no exception to the master's work.  The only sad thing about this movie is that this is the last film he will ever make.  And what an ending it was. He shocked people with Clockwork Orange and frightened them with 2001 Space Odyssey and The Shining.  Eyes Wide Shut is not about sex, which is what the previews would have you believe, rather it is about paranoia.  The paranoia of trusting a spouse. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman both give performances of a lifetime.  Nicole finally gets the credit she deserves. Kubrick fans will not be disappointed by his final film.

1070,jkkeller,Pre-release rumors detract from this film...,3,17 July 1999,"I was extremely disappointed with ""Eyes Wide Shut"", for a number of reasons. The first, which is unfortunately no fault of Kubrick, Cruise, or Kidman, is that part of the marketing campaign was to NOT disavow any of the rumors about the plot of this movie.  My understanding, at the time I was walking into the theater, was that I was about to see a movie about a married couple, both of whom happen to be sex therapists, who explore their mutual sexual fantasies.  Sorry to spoil things for you, folks... the movie has nothing to do with that.  in fact (sorry ladies) Tom Cruise never has sex in this film.  Granted, it's equally disappointing when a movie trailer reveals the best scenes of a movie, but in this instance, i felt totally misled.Reason number two:  3 hours of very slow, dragging, film.  I felt there were numerous scenes that could have been trimmed.  There were a number of supporting characters who have moderately lengthy scenes, for no payoff whatsoever.  Why the lengthy scene at the costume rental shop, when we could just see Cruise in a costume, and ASSUME he managed to get one?Reason number 3:  I had little or no emotional attachment to the cold, machine-like Cruise, and no sympathy for Kidman, who laughs at her husband while revealing a past sexual fantasy with another man, and her willingness to jeopardize her own marriage over it.There are aspects of this movie that are deep and interesting.  Even in the 24 hours since I've seen the film, I've found some deeper insight after reflecting on it.  However, I'd recommend that you wait for this to hit the $1.50 rental rack, instead of rushing to the multiplex to catch it!",Eyes Wide Shut
1071,abeer,a total disappointment,1,17 July 1999,"Cheap thrills with the usual feminine full nudity.  No character development or plot.  Didn't achieve any of the psychological thrills promised. Possibly the most unerotic movie that's been billed as erotic, that I've ever seen (see ""Out of Sight"" for a real sexual/erotic movie) sordid encounters at every turn.  The only good thing I have to say about this is that the cinematography was great.  But that's it.",Eyes Wide Shut
1072,Welsh-2,A good ending to a great career.,8,17 July 1999,"Kubrick's last film is a good (not great) ending to a stellar career. What is interesting is that Kubrick's strongest moments in this film are precisely the sort of moments that he has been criticized for coming up short on in the past: the human moments, the character-driven moments. The private scenes between Kidman and Cruise are the highlights of this film--Kubrick's relentlessly voyeuristic camera records the tense and cruel moments between the couple with true sympathetic detachment. A montage of the mundane moments that make up the couple's time apart is sensitive and colored with Kubrick's usual eye for irony. (Those who worried that Kidman and Cruise were not worthy need not worry--they both come through better than I, for one, would have expected. They both do very well, making Bill and Alice two of the truest human beings in the Kubrick canon).What is not as strong in this film, though, are those moments that Kubrick fans have been trained to expect: the haunting images that burn themselves into our brains, the intense and relentless tracking shots, the impeccable use of music. The much-anticipated orgy sequence is marred by digitally imposed images of onlookers--fig leafs that ensured Kubrick an R instead of an NC-17. And they are much like the fig leafs added to great paintings in the sense that they add a note of distraction and silliness to potentially striking moments. The entire masquerade/orgy sequence moves between brilliant and farcical, but in the end seems unnecessary. Kubrick would have done well to record marital jealousy and infidelity without the melodrama.The philosophy behind the film will take some time to decipher. The dominant idea that sticks with me after two viewings is the repeated linking of sex and death--again and again the sexual act of creation is linked with death.A good film, then, but a bit too long. In the end, it feels like a transitional work between the brilliantly visceral intensity of Kubrick's best work of the past and a new cinema more rooted in everyday life. It is doubly sad, then, that Kubrick died before he could more fully explore this new stage in his artistic career.Thank you, Stanley. For everything.",Eyes Wide Shut
1073,Cygnes,May I yawn.,1,26 September 1999,"Come on people. Why do people rate this movie a 10? I've been to this movie yesterday together with my girlfriend. There were a lot of people, there were only a few seats left.Some commercials started and previews of upcoming movies, and finally the movie started. The movie that was very promoted in the media and was promising a lot! But after a whole lot of minutes, nothing happened, no story, nothing. Very slow scenes, texts by the characters where slow, it looked like it took 1 sentence a minute. Come on. I almost fell asleep!! Like the whole audience!Overall: Good actors, bad/no story, stupid ending ( it just ended....no clues...) Everybody complained after the movie!It's just a waste of time, and money. I hope Cruise and Kidman decide to pick a better movie next time. This sure hasn't helped a lot in their career in my opinion.It's been the worst movie I've seen in years.

It's a complex film that not all will appreciate, but the more open you are to - whatever - the more apt you are to enjoy this tale of love, sex, jealousy and fear. Things do not always move at a snappy pace and a few scenes could have been cut in half, but if you love the art of film and admire Kubrick in any way, you've got to appreciate what he was trying to do even if the outcome is not to your liking. The music and some scenes - the masked figures nodding(to name just one)- will stick with me for a long time. I never thought one note on a piano key could make me sit up so straight. I want to see it again, but I think it may be a hard sell for the mall movie gang.",Eyes Wide Shut

If you are looking for an intellectually stimulating film you will be very disappointed it is lumbering and odd, slow moving and pointless.  This film is silly and whiney the viewer never learns what exactly is going on and what we do learn is disjointed and lame. The plot is stale and not fully explored the sex is gratuitous and not very interesting.  There is too much that is unexplained and the entire movie does not make sense. The characters are obsessed with revenge and sex and never fully explored.  The chemistry between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman fizzles right from the beginning and is as volatile as water.   The trailers make you think you are going to see some great psychological thriller but the ending is cheesy and unsatisfying and does not do justice to Stanley Kubrick's last film.

The religious ritual symbolism of the orgy scene was as creepy as creepy can be. I expected the film to be erotic, but was not turned on by any part of it. That's not a criticism, exactly, but you may not want to take a date to this movie (as I did) hoping it will inspire a hot and heavy after-movie encounter...you will probably be disappointed.

It is a work of art that (I believe) is Kubrick's greatest triumph.  The music was very simple but so sensational in the fact that it was blended with the visual aids to create an extremely suspenseful and exhilarating movie experience.  The scene in the mansion with the hooded and masked figures was one of the most awe inspiring scenes in film history.  A must-see for all Kubrick fans and film fans in general.  Also, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were excellent.  Tom's best movie yet!!

Soft focus, high grain, Bergman-esque, with garish holiday background lighting, numerous ""drop-in"" scenes which seem unrelated to the major plot line, terrific ensemble acting, and an emotional range from Tom Cruise we've not seen previously. The disappointingly ""neat and tidy"" reconciliation scene at the conclusion seems to point to the sad fact Kubrick was unable to spend the necessary amount of time in the editing room, finalizing his vision. Regardless, this is a film which will be talked about for a long time--certainly longer than any of the more juvenile offerings (Star Wars, Big Daddy, Wild Wild West) currently jamming the US multiplexes.",Eyes Wide Shut
1083,Skywise-4,A fitting completion to Kubrick's study of humanity,10,17 July 1999,"I managed to swallow my expectations before the film, setting myself to judge it on its own without judging it as a Kubrick film. No need, no need! This film IS a Kubrick film, without any doubt, and as all Kubrick films are it was absolutely stunning. Absolutely. Visually it is brilliant, though I should warn that this isn't quite as visual a film as most other Kubrick works. A lot of the film focuses on the characters, on human interaction, something rather new to this director. Of course, all the Kubrick trademarks are there, cold analytical gazes, sharp introspection. Tom Cruise seems like Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining' and even Malcolm MacDowell in 'A Clockwork Orange' at times, a rather striking fact considering that this is Tom Cruise. The performances were excellent all around, even from places not expected. Again, this is typical for Kubrick. He wasn't much of a people director, but he still knew how to direct people.Almost every moment of this film was flawless, perfect and pristine. The dialog is predictable, but in some solemn and holy fateful sort of way, as though the words and the moments are matched so essentially that nothing else could possibly fit. Beyond that the sounds and images all fit together beautifully, creating an almost unblemished whole. The only part that didn't seem right was the sequence that had been digitally altered. While the alterations were not nearly so obtrusive as I had feared (not knowing about them one probably wouldn't notice them) they do grow a bit noticeable for redundancy (you see a lot more backs than you'd expect, and always in the same places). Unfortunately these came right in the middle of one of the most visually amazing pieces of the film (one of the most amazing pieces of cinema as a whole, in my opinion), a very unwelcome distraction.Is this movie about sex? Yes, it is, but more importantly it is about people. The sex part is simply a product thereof. This is one of the most disturbingly honest portraits of human behavior and motivations ever made. The most honest I've ever seen, at least. To be put simply: It is about sex because people are about sex.I'm still trying to sort through this movie. It's been a good twelve hours since I saw it, and I can still feel it, hard and definite, rotating in my stomach. The film itself seems mostly void of opinion (not entirely, but mostly), serving more as a general statement and commentary than any specific moral warning, but the questions it inspires are very strong indeed. The film, being objective, provides no answers, no justification for humanity. There is no redemption, either, none whatsoever. The film's final word sums it (it being the film and humanity) up pretty well, for better or for worse. I guess that depends on you.A common thread in Kubrick's films since 2001 has been the contemplation and examination of human intentions, the essence of human behavior. Motivations. He's shown us violence and madness and everything else, all tracking the path back to the dawn of man. I think he finally figured it out with this film, however anticlimactic the discovery might have been. At least he did finally figure it out. That's something.I am one of many. I never had the privilege to know Stanley Kubrick. I don't even know that privilege is the right word. I do know his films, though, and while I am in no position to say that I will miss him as a person, I can say, without doubt or hesitation, that I will miss him as a filmmaker.",Eyes Wide Shut
1084,mk-27,Classic Kubrick,8,17 July 1999,"'Eyes Wide Shut' focuses Stanley Kubrick's incisive vision on the psychology of desire in the 1990s. The film displays classic Kubrick styling - from the drama which he imbues to everydayness, and heightens with the resonance of a simple cutting soundtrack, to a glimpse at mysterious and grandiose ritual behaviour - that leaves one not completely certain about what is real or a fabrication of the mind.Like Philip Kaufman's 1990 film 'Henry and June', 'Eyes Wide Shut' illustrates how 'alternative' sexuality is a natural outgrowth of commonplace desire and fantasy. It focuses on the characters' explorations of their sexuality without becoming distracted by sex itself (which in all honesty is much more tame than ratings lead us to belive, and certainly will be no shock to European audiences).Nicole Kidman's performance is honest and subtle with a beauty which does not collapse into mere elegance. The sets spare no expense in contributing to an overall sensory richness perfectly suited to the cinema, or the opera.",Eyes Wide Shut

These people will be highly disappointed by the fact that this film is incredibly erotic without being extremely illicit.  As usual for Stanley Kubrick, the film is full of tastefulness and amazing camera angles that show you just how much characterization and suspense can be built through solid camera work.  If you are searching for passionate sex scenes, look elsewhere; if you have a true desire to see a master of moviemaking performing using every bit of talent (actors included) he can muster, you will thoroughly enjoy yourself.",Eyes Wide Shut
1087,S.K,An exquisite finale!,10,17 July 1999,"Stanley Kubrick's final film is a broodingly psychological, frightening and dark work.In a way, it is an interesting opus to end a legendary career, since his past masterpieces (i.e. 2001: A Space Odyssey; A Clockwork Orange; Dr. Strangelove; etc.) had several Freudian meanings toward the larger picture, whether it was a satire on crime or a grand view of the universe.
And as a finale, Eyes Wide Shut's sexual flavor puts all of his works in full circle in that aspect. But each frame of the film is so cluttered with symbolism and abstract messages (as typical of Kubrick) that the poetic facet of his films are also given a concluding spin.As with his other pieces, the photography is wonderous, capturing the aura of the raw emotions, the terror of the escapades and the maddening facets of lust. And as usual, the music is placed so skillfully that it encompasses the passions of each aspect of the scene.Eyes Wide Shut is truly a remarkable ending of a truly remarkable career. The themes of his past works resurface, subtly, but tightly resolved as the Freudian final word is uttered.",Eyes Wide Shut
1088,beatta,The Normal Tour-De Force Kubrick Film..... NOT a Normal Cruise Film.,10,18 July 1999,"It must be stated I loved this film... Eyes Wide Shut returns to the nineties the cinematic style and pacing that has been lacking as of late. Tragically this is the Grand Master Kubrick's final work, however it is a remarkable end to his career.  Nicole Kidman is excellent in her (albeit brief) performance, if there is any negative comment about this film it would have to be Tom Cruise's acting... there are times when he is incrediable and also time when he looks like he is a rookie actor, dazzed by the filming going on.  The trademarks of a Kubrick film are all  here, the heavy music being masterly craft to make the ultimate amount of suspense and heavy tone... To all Kubrick fans see it immediately.... and Enjoy!",Eyes Wide Shut
1089,sonicjag,+ style - substance,1,17 July 1999,"OK I would just like to say that I am enraged at the acclaim some are giving this film.  It was all style and no substance. Silence does not equal good film making.  It just means the director has no qualms about ejaculating whatever crap he wants to onto the screen.  The long drawn out pauses and sparse/piercing soundtrack might work in films like Shining and 2001 but they become distracting, even comical in EYES WIDE SHUT. One cannot rely on the same tired tricks to propel one's self through an entire career.  This film needs to be judged on its own and not in relation to Kubrick's canon. It makes me sick to hear critics revere this work simply because it came from a man who has done well in the past. This film was not cryptic not mysterious not thought provoking and not even sexy.  Far from a masterpiece and a poor display for Kubrick's final outing.",Eyes Wide Shut

1092,Orson45,Hypnotic!,10,18 July 1999,"At a time in the history of movie making where every single director seems obsessed by special effects and where screenplays are considered unimportant, it is a great lesson to watch such a movie. Jealousy, dreams, reality, man, woman, sexuality, desire, etc... Who but Kubrick could have tackled today these realities with such hypnotic power? The movie is pure magic, the cinematography of it nothing short of gorgeous, the soundtrack absolutely riveting (especially the Ligeti piano music, haunting), the actors (more Kidman than Cruise) are remarkable. This is cinema of the highest level. I'm glad that I've seen it and will certainly go see it again and again. That's the difference between a genius (Kubrick) and those ordinary talented directors (Lucas, Spielberg and co.); his movies are so loaded with layers of meanings that they are virtually always new when you see them on numerous occasions. I wish everybody could experience ""Eyes Wide Shut""; it is profoundly moving and powerful.(Too bad that we, Canadians, were obliged to see the amputated version; we should have been granted with the original).",Eyes Wide Shut

1094,chick-16,What were the critics thinking?,3,18 July 1999,"I divide this movie into two parts.  Part 1 Nicole Kidman gets naked a lot, and Part 2 Tom Cruise puts in a series of pathetic attempts to cheat on his wife while remaining entirely confused.  What most bothered me about this film (aside from it's extreme, boring length and painfully drawn out scenes) was it's treatment of the main characters, specifically Nicole Kidman.  The infamous orgy scene is rather dull, and the treatment of women in it is very dehumanizing, but it is supposed to be.  The treatment of Kidman's character, however, is very base.  (I had no real sympathy for the character.  She simpers her way through the party scene at the beginning of the movie in a most irritating fashion.)  At first the quirky treatment of the everyday (we see Kidman on the toilette in her beautiful evening dress) is amusing.  It is nice to see something real.  We've become so accustomed to the fake loud noises of fight scenes and the fact that all phone numbers begin with 555, that it is kind of nice to see a little harmless taboo reality.  It becomes irritating, however, when it is only Kidman's character that receives this treatment.  We see her later putting on deodorant.  In the first half of the film (she disappears for huge portions of the rest of the film) she is treated very differently from the way in which Cruise's character is.  The movie begins with her getting naked, and in the scene in which she reveals a past desire to cheat on Cruise we continually get full body shots of Kidman (who is unquestionably gorgeous and worth looking at). Cruise, however, continually gets the ""money"" shots - head shots.  We see him naked only once in the short and poorly edited, ""they did a bad, bad thing"" shot.  Neither of the characters seems to have an understanding of his or her own gender let alone the other's.  Kidman's character makes the most naive and silly complaints against Cruise for pointing out the obvious (yes, she is a gorgeous woman and men will want to get her in bed). Cruise's character is equally naive when he asserts that women are only looking for security and commitment, not sex. Moreover, it's just a really bad, boring movie, full of horrible (let me say that again for emphasis - HORRIBLE) dialog and scenes that are unnecessarily drawn out (For those of you who have to see it I example the pool table conversation between Cruise and ""Ziggler"") Don't let me forget to say that it's predictable. The only thing good I can say about this movie was that it made excellent use of lighting and exploring the possibilities of grainy film.",Eyes Wide Shut
1095,sean-112,"long, pretentious and mis-casted.",3,18 July 1999,"I thought Tom and Nicole were mis - cast in the lead roles.  This damaged the film beyond repair.

The media seems to be very wrong about the movie being loaded with sex...I didn't feel that way at all.  I thought the movie ended a little pre-maturely, since there were still a few questions that I would have liked to have seen answered.

The cinematography was spectacular - especially a scene in the mansion with all of the masked and cloaked individuals gathered together, the dialogue was intense and very deliberate (no jargon filler), and the suspense and intrigue really kept me hanging on until the end.The movie dragged on at times but kept within the theme of showing the complexity of marriage, specifically jealousy within marriage.  Its unfortunate that this will be Kubrick's last cinematic experience, fortunately he ended his legacy with a gem of a movie.",Eyes Wide Shut
1100,supafly-4,"A nice artistic vision, and provocative, kinky calling card to a very long, prosperous and effective career.",9,19 July 1999,"It's hard for me to really describe Eyes Wide Shut.  I see LOTS of films ranging from mindless to avante garde, but I am generally able to come to a focused take on them as a film.  But after leaving Eyes Wide Shut I could only describe it as being like a giant, complex painting hanging in an empty gallery.  I feel as though I apprached this hanging painting and gazed into it for 3 hours paying sharp attention to each and every minute detail. The outcome?  This film is an amazing piece of work. I found its message of the possible evils of sexual, how do we say, experimentation, liberation (any term lacking better words) to  be perfectly clear from start to finish. Though many of those I attended the film with found absolutely no point in what they were watching, I found that its point was perfectly clear. It is so hard to fully describe how I feel about this film.  It is not that I thought the acting was great.  I thought Tom Cruise (and I like Cruise's work) wasn't so perfect for the part. He had the boyish looks to pull off his character's youthful, naive struggle.  But overall he was somewhat lacking the depth to fully delve into such a complex character.  Nicole Kidman on the other hand, I found to be a low-point in the film.  I thought her performance was at times laughably bad and over-the-top. How annoying and self-centered can one girl be after drinking some champagne or smoking a little pot?  Her character had surprisingly little film time, and after seeing the film it is quite understandable why she was placed on the back burner. Aside from the acting, I didn't think the writing was of any spectacular caliber either. But what's amazing about Eyes Wide Shut is that the story and mostly Kubrick's portrayal of that story easily overcome any of the film's other shortcomings. I dunno...I don't want to get caught in a tangent describing each individual aspect.  What does need mentioning is the filmd Carnival-like 'Poe-esque' orgy scene.  Truly memorable, guaranteed to go down in film-history.  It was one of the most oddly-horrifying scenes I have witnessed. In closing, I can just say again that the film was an incredible artistic portrayal, not meant to entertain all, but to paint a vivid picture of a story of greed, desire, and mistrust.",Eyes Wide Shut

(And, to be fair, I actually do some film reviews for a major metropolitan newspaper.) Apparently because this was directed by the legendary Kubrick, we're all supposed to love it. Hey, 2001, Dr. Strangelove, Clockwork Orange were all classics--but this is just a bad, poorly scripted, (mostly) poorly acted waste. I've seen it twice (out of necessity), and it just gets worse.

1102,DebLynn,missed potential,5,20 July 1999,"Eyes Wide Shut raises interesting issues around marriage, sex, fidelity, and, as a thinking film, it will give you something to discuss with friends over drinks after you leave the theatre.  But, the slow pace, bland dialogue, and less than inspiring acting left me wanting more.  There was definitely more to be said in the film, more to explore that was only scratched at.  Although I appreciate a film that leaves me thinking, wondering, debating, rather than telling me what to believe, this one fell flat.  A major problem was in casting.  It takes a certain kind of actor to pull off the dialogue and situations in this type of film and Tom and Nicole are not that type of actor.  Sydney Pollack and Alan Cumming both gave fine performances and were much better suited to the genre and script.  There is potential here, but the product did not deliver as it could have.",Eyes Wide Shut

If you're looking for dumb entertainment, go see AUSTIN POWERS 2 (dull and a husk of the original movie); if you're looking for well-designed and implemented entertainment, go see STAR WARS (just remember it's the first two hours of a 14+ hour movie - any lack of plot or characterization is purposefully put in the movie and will be drawn out in the next two); if you're looking for art, go see EYES WIDE SHUT.Almost any couple who's had strife in their relationship will see bits and pieces of themselves in the film.

1104,Milady-L,Made Thirty Years Too Late,2,20 July 1999,"WARNING: Below are character and plot revelations, and the liberal use of the F-word in all its Anglo-Saxon glory. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK:-- Do they 'do' it?  No.-- Does he 'do' it? No. -- Does anyone actually DO *anything* at all, ever? No. {thereby wasting two and a half hours of perfectly good time that could have been spent filing my nails. Which reminds me of a really good JAP joke, but... never mind.}Bias going in: Expecting, hoping, maybe even needing to worship at the feet of the Master. In no particular order:Casting:Bummer. Cruise is about a hundred years too young for the part. The book (and film it 'inspired'... a direct quote from the closing credits) calls for a man approaching young middle age, life-philosophy and habits set in the stone of an already closed mind. In other words, a jaded man as complacent as any white male at the pinnacle of a societally-valued career can be -- and who is about to have the core of his smug little being shaken to its roots. An Everyman, yes -- but a man, not a boy.
Kidman: Eye-candy disguised as a window-dressing plot device. A pun on the title that's only too apt, I'm afraid. She has no career, no goals, no... I was about to say 'dreams and desires' but that would be only figuratively true. She has them 'literally' so Cruise can play off them, but in the sense they exist at all, they exist for him alone, as do all the other women in the film. What she does have, however, is a great butt. To-Die-For great. ==cough, cough=> Kidman/Cruise, as couple and chemistry: More interesting, because it was both good and bad. I can see the attraction for Kubrick; the ready-made comfort level that would allow him to make the first scene (her taking a casual pee while Cruise responds to her 'how do I look?' with 'great, as always') work. But. That same level of unstrived-for coupleness that comes after ten years of marriage is also... boring. I don't mean the sort of boring-for-the-sake-of-him-kicking-over-the-traces banality that would incite a viewer to wonder what lay beneath the calluses, but a real been-there, done-that quality that came through *despite* Kubrick's intentions. Given all the above, the cynic in me wonders (and will never know) if the only way to get Her marvelously sculpted butt was to hire His cute little manicured face.Script:Think of a primer on writing that warns against 'on-the-nose' dialogue by giving examples. This entire script could be used to fill it. Right down to the 50-point type, front page, carefully-placed-to-look-like-a-throwaway newspaper headline that screams the film's message: LUCKY TO BE ALIVE!  And entire speeches revealing motive and mindset have been lifted in their entirety from the book and plunked here---a mere seventy-three years and a galaxy far, far, away---later. There's more---lots more---but I'm depressed just thinking about it.Plot:-- Kidman almost has a late afternoon zipless f**k... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost has two early evening super-models super f**ks... but doesn't.-- Kidman almost goes off with an aging Hungarian lothario... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost sleeps with a hooker... but doesn't.-- Cruise learns that he almost slept with a hooker... with AIDS... and is glad he hadn't.-- Cruise almost kisses a dead woman... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost gives in to irrational sexual jealousy... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost gets laid at an orgy... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost gets in trouble at an orgy... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost has to strip at an orgy... but doesn't.-- Cruise almost has his comfy little apple cart of a life upset... and I sincerely wish it had been.Shall I go on, or have I laid bare the bones of a film that was overheard in the bathroom afterward as: ""Too slooow, and jeez, nothing ever happened.""Visuals: The orgy was just silly and overlong, as were most of the other scenes. The use of color: red for sexuality and blue for emotion (I think; they just blurred after a while) has been done before, and better in films like Jou Dou, Raise High the Red Lantern and especially TC,TT,HWAHL.
Pace: Glacial, which would be forgiven if there were a pay-off. And even so, thirty minutes could easily be cut with no loss to anyone.Concept:Mind-blowing news just discovered by the original writer of the novella and the otherwise brilliant director of the movie: women *like* to f**k!
--  Film at eleven.Sigh. This was by far the film's most egregious fault: it was made at least thirty years too late. Kubrick's widow said that he became obsessed with the book (which she wisely refused to read, feeling that all that 'psychological conversation' was boringly passe, and Schnitzler's failed attempt to overlay new-fangled Freudian theory on old-fashioned Burghers, lame) in 1968. Maybe... a big maybe... if Kubrick had made the film then, transforming fin de siecle Vienna into an insight on the so-called sexual revolution taking place in middle-class America, it might have worked. But now? Aside from the fact that there was nothing in that 'orgy' (ridiculous R, or NC-17 version) that isn't seen nightly on Spice channel *ads* -- the film destroyed the book's main conceit: That middle-class matrons so longed to be f**ked silly (an impossible 'dream' at a time and place where, according to Schnitzler, woman married just to lose their virginity in a societally approved way), and middle-class men so longed to be freed (if only for a few hours, and only anonymously) of their Madonna/Whore complex -- that a if-you-reveal-our-secret-you-die club flourished in the shadows. A club where otherwise sexually repressed men could live out their frightening Freudian fantasies and even more repressed women could give in to their penis envy by engulfing a few dozen at a time, and where getting caught could mean expulsion from decent society, loss of children, or worse. What a titillating idea... then.  In Eyes Wide Shut however, aging, wealthy men pay to be serviced by young, beautiful hookers with great tits and no sags, blemishes, untrimmed bikini lines or cellulite. Wow -- is that a nouveau concept, or what? Oh, and despite the fact that it's the *man* who's supposedly being stripped bare (it's Cruise's movie all the way) there's no male nudity of course, blemished or otherwise -- except for two unclothed, sort of heaving, chests. Worse: by not tackling what is true of marriage today -- that in a society which encourages us to experiment in every possible way with our bodies, but never our hearts, minds and souls, keeping the sexual frisson alive while married to the same person for even ten years is damn difficult -- Kubrick missed his chance to bring his genius to bear on his vision.
And so that which in 1926 might have been erotic, is today laughable. Cruise is jealous because of Kidman's unrealized *fantasy* (after ten years of faithful marriage, no less)? Hell, what long-married couple doesn't *use* those fantasies as the over-the-counter equivalent of Viagra? Along with visual aids and toys from the neighborhood sex shop. Hotel guest and Cabana boy (Mad About You), anyone? Master and Maid? Liddy and Bob play Doctor and the Drugstore? Well, you get the point. Tension:Over what -- that rich, powerful men in masks pay for group sex and might be discovered doing it? Booking a spot on Letterman and bragging about being a club member is more like it. Kidman feeling like Cruise is taking her for granted? Tune in to Oprah. Kidman's sobbing in *terror* and *shame* while recounting a dream in which she'd been willingly f**ked by countless men? Puh-lease. I swear, D.H. is standing in the wings, laughing himself silly and wondering when the remake of Lady Chatterly will be done, and which part Adam Sandler will play. In fact, the only real tension in nearly three hours was unintentional. At the very end, when Kidman and Cruise are patting each other's backs for being such lucky ducks and staying safely married despite the wicked temptations around them, all I could think about was their young daughter, who'd been left to wander alone in what looked like F.A.O. Schwartz for an interminable time -- long enough to be grabbed by some really dangerous modern character and spirited away -- and all I wanted to do was yell 'go find your child, you insufferable clods!'  A sign, I suppose, that I wasn't exactly moved by either of them, or their 'plight'.Your mileage may vary.",Eyes Wide Shut
1105,eli-38,A stimulating and beautiful look at fantasy and life,10,20 July 1999,"This film used the exquisite cinematography that I think American movies have lacked over the past 20 years. It's so rare that an American movie uses closeups on a single face to show that there really is some emotion in the eyes of the actor. The subject matter was interesting as well, fantasy as a theme has never been played so well and it makes you think about what the title means to each character's role.

1106,Robert01,"Flawed, Symbolic Final Film",10,20 July 1999,"Kubrick's final movie wasn't perfect, but it was a good entertainment, and it made me think.  Although by now the plot is well known, I will suggest that in viewing it you could be aware of a few things:  1) The movie is a symbolic journey into the underworld, much as the travels of Orpheus into Hades to rescue his true love.  2)  All the women in the movie are a part of Dr. Hartford's wife.  3)  The movie is about jealousy, but it is mostly about how little we know of other people.  It's about how all we see are masks (looks for this), the tip of the iceburg of unconscious fantasy and desire.  It's about the trauma of sudden, unexpected revelation of sexual desire, a Freudian theme.  4)  Look for the use of color as a symbol of state of mind, of the use of intoxicants as a signal of changing state of being.  5)  Who is the inquisitor in the orgy scene, how does he relate to Lew, Dr. Hartford's friend?  In any case, the movie, like any good fiction, resists simple messages and morals.  The fun of it for me was to go and see it, which was an enjoyable 2.5 hours that passed too quickly (the movie is visually beautiful, as are Cruise and Kidman) and then have something interesting to puzzle over for a while.

Never saw so many breasts in my life, it's all you could look at, forget the dialogue, no one was paying attention to the words.  The musical score was jarring and annoying, I may have not been so annoyed with the movie if it had not been for the score.I think men were short-changed in this movie, they were portrayed as idiots who thought a woman's fantasies were an act of betrayal and so to get even they should go out a have sex with anyone who was willing.  And what kind of idiot would tell her husband stuff like that anyway, get real!After a while the f.. word and the nudity were ineffective because they were everywhere!  This movie reminded me of a bad porno movie, lots of sex, or in Tom Cruise's case, lots of opportunity,  and little plot.

It could have been a sexual thriller... but it wasn't. Rather, it was a 14 year old boys sexual fantasy without the freshness. Tom Cruise plodded through this - you could see him trying desperately to look concerned, look loving, look earnest. And he failed dismally at all of them.

Also characteristic of Kubrick's best work, the themes present here are many and complex.  Not only is this Kubrick's best film in thirty years (and that itself is certainly saying a lot), but it's also his most fascinating, his most intriguing, his most confusing, and the one which best lends itself to critical and intellectual analysis.

I agree with the reviews that the movie delves deep into the analysis of human instincts and the complexities of emotions.  But, here is my bottom line take on the movie - It's entertaining.  I can't remember the last time I was so nervous watching a movie - the closest was when I saw Pulp Fiction and Bruce Willis was going through the backyards to get to his apartment to grab his watch.

1119,augenguy,Got it wrong,10,27 July 1999,"There seems to be a general consensus that this film is about sexual intrigue and the relationship of husband and wife, but I submit that this interpretation is way off base.Let us begin with the symbolism that Kubrick uses.  One may notice that in nearly every frame, there are thousands of small lights, one might even say a thousand points of light.  This is, in fact, a symbol employed by certain secret organizations to refer to their members.  On the list would be the freemasons, the Illuminati, et cetera.  It was employed by a former president of the US on a number of occasions, and this president was, in fact, a member of secret organizations.Next, when the main character enters the house where his adventure begins, where the old man has just died and the daughter makes a play for him, there is a falcon statuette in the hallway, which recures several times.  The falcon is symbolic of the Egyptian god Horus, son of Isis and Osiris.  The connection to this god is reinforced by the setting in wintertime, which is dominated astronomically by the constellation Orion, or Osiris, and the star Sirius, or Isis.  The additional use of Christmas time, the symbols of which are decendent from Roman and Egyptian festivals of light and rebirth, further enhances this connection (ie- the Christmas tree, lights, etc.).The obvious use of a Luciferian mass for the orgy is, without doubt, a reference to the secret societies.  Even the masks used are various symbols and images employed by Luciferians.  The loose and very grey morality of the characters through-out serve to enhance this reference.  Even the characters, man and wife, do not refer to physical love with any reverence. It is simply a course and vulgar act.  And that Lucifer is the fallen star, the light of Heaven fallen to Earth, is further reflected in the use of the thousand points of light.Kubrick has even alluded to his own doubts and misgivings about himself in this area.  The way in which he allows himself to appear in reflection, not a mistake by an amateur, but purposeful, is telling.  The scenes in which the camera is visible tells us that we, too, must now suspect our own motivations.  In other words, this belief system has become so pervasive, that no one is immune to its machinations.There are many more subtle and oblate references.  For instance, the name of the restaurant in the background when the main character is being followed. The music being played when he stops into the pub for a beer immediately after (reference the password used to enter the house).Kubrick has sent out a warning.  He is trying to wake the audience up to the hidden messages all around us.  Our eyes, he says, are wide shut.  We see, but we do not understand.  This film bears additional viewings to pick out the rich subtlety embedded in it.  But viewing it with these points in mind will suddenly open a vastly deeper subtext to the film.",Eyes Wide Shut

The suspense and lead up to the operatic orgy gained more pleasure for the audience when the delivery arrived, leaving them intrigued by the the castle, the masks and fastidious(prostitutes) male figureheads not disclosed.

Sure, Kubrick had high ambitions for Eyes Wide Shut, and he certainly raised some interesting questions about relationships and secret thoughts and fantasies.But please. Eyes Wide Shut is horribly miscast. Tom Cruise might be able to play a doctor in M*A*S*H, but he comes across with no credibility in this movie. His acting is shallow, his believability nil.Sydney Pollack, as the mysterious, wealthy Ziegler, in the end, fuels paranoia about the great Zionist conspiracy (rich, powerful people who shall remain nameless, indeed). He may be credible as a businessman, but not as a member of the power elite; he looks and acts too much like one's Uncle Saul. Kubrick originally intended to cast Harvey Keitel, and it's a shame that Keitel didn't make it. Keitel would have had brought the ominous underlying tension needed for the role.Then there's the sexism. Now, I enjoyed Nicole Kidman immensely. I'd like to take her home with me, and she actually was one of the better actors. But how Kubrick could film a movie rife with female frontal nudity and not show even one little johnson is inexcusable in this day and age. We don't even get to see where the sun doesn't shine on Tom Cruise. This inequity merely contributes to the movie's out-of-whackness.I could go one about the contrived situations and the ham-fisted acting.If you really want to see a movie that raises many of the same questions, head over to the video store for Apocolypse Now, which chronicles a similar kind of personal voyage, with better acting, less obvious atmosphere, and a Marlon Brando who, although also miscast, is somehow less irritating.",Eyes Wide Shut

1126,thEnigma,Kubrick's Stirring Final Masterpiece (of Garbage),1,11 September 1999,"To be completely honest, I love to read all of the reviews people give films like this. Pseudo-intellectual film school students pulling meaning and subtext from hollow, meaningless films. It's quite amusing, actually. You see, if it wasn't for the fact that this film was a Kubrick film, it would be completely knocked by the film going public and critics alike. No one could possibly like a film like this, because it's bad. Bad in every respect of the word, not a single frame in this film is anything but dreadful.Why, you might ask, is it rated so well... Easy, I respond. Many people who want to feel as if they're intelligent try append meaning to the meaningless, and pull some form of artistic integrity out of a film like this. So, if you liked this film, you're one of two things. 1. A thirteen year old boy (for the nudity, of course). 2. A pseudo-intellectual, self-praising poser. Now, stop and think which group you fit into...Now, Kubrick has never been a genius, not close. His films are boring garbage, plain and simple. The only thing Kubrick did in his career is '2001' and that's only due to the fact that '2001' was so far ahead of it's time. The rest of the Kubrick catalog is littered with hollow rubbish.
This film, in particular, is by far the worst. It looks bad, it looks like a bad blow up from a 16mm print. The sets are pitiful, the lighting is horrid... nothing in the film is good. Even the acting is sub-par, which is surprising. I'm not a Cruise or Kidman fan at all, but I would have to say that, with the exception of 'Eyes Wide Shut', they've been able to churn out some descent performances.The script, even though re-written many, many times is inane. Whatever possibilities this film had were lost. Maybe if someone other than Kubrick would've been helming this project it could've came off as something good, but the way it turned out is rediculous.Here's my advice...

Instead, it has been a big delusion.First tom cruise is absolutely unfit for his role>he is good at piloting jet fighters and making cocktails, but he has nothing to do with the character he plays, nor with the movie and that it is all to evident.  Nicole kidman is slightly better and more credible, but that is not enough since her role is indeed secondary to that of her husband.  Furthermore, the couple interaction is very limited and remains fundamentally unexplored.Basically, the movie is about some of kidman's innocent sexual fantasy, which cruise cannot digest.  So he tries in every possible way to vindicate his offended ego, without being able to do so, not even in a huge luxury brothel, filled with naked women beyond imaginable and reasonable.  And so, after the two stars appear to have metabolised their ghosts, they also came up with the stunning conclusion: we must have more sex!!My impression is that kubrick had an idea, and was unable to find the ideal actors, so he settled for a second or maybe forth best, since the choices available around where limited. Secondly, I suspect that if the director had had the time to complete his work, this movie would have been substantially different and less clumsy.

It is only natural that the two would come together in one of his own obsessions, bringing Arthur Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle"" to the screen. Since 1975 there have been rummors suggesting that he was working on this project. It is fitting that this is his last film, an end to one of his continuing obsessions.The film appears to be a dream, a dream that most people in a serious relatonship have had.

Within that ""Dallas"" like setting problems and moral dilemmas simply do not appear real. The lack of reality was heightened by the inclusion of scenes who were completly unnecessary for the advancement on the story.The 2 1/2 hours of footage could well be cut into a standard movie dealing with the moral dilemma, and a one hour tits and ass ""C""-grade movie.Sorry, Stanley Kubriecek, I expected a lot more of you.",Eyes Wide Shut

However, by itself, Eyes Wide Shut is an excellent movie. Much of the negative response to the film is due to people not understanding the film.  I have heard many similar comments regarding Kubrick's other films, including my two favorite, Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange.  I remember responding to those who did not like either film and challenging them to describe what the point of the two films are.  Nobody gave much of an intelligent response.  Many focused solely on the rape scene in Orange, and a few did not realize that in Strangelove, Peter Sellers played Mandrake, the President, and Dr. Strangelove. Upon explaining certain aspects and targets of Strangelove and Orange, I usually received an ""oh, now I get it"".  I am certain that the very same brilliant individuals who initially had contempt for those two movies are blasting Eyes Wide Shut.  Not very surprising.Eyes Wide Shut is, as most Kubrick films are, a brilliantly shot movie and well-acted, and although the story did drag a little longer than I wished it had, it still was an excellent movie.  There were no real incredible acting performances, but incredible acting has always been an accident in most Kubrick films.  Kubrick makes films that are technically perfect and well-acted.  Only a handful of performances in his films could be called brilliant.  George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Peter Sellers, Slim Pickins, Malcolm McDowell, Michael Bates, Patrick Magee, R. Lee Ermey, and Jack Nicholson are the only actors that come to mind that gave such a performance, and not ironically, all but two mentioned actors gave their performances in Strangelove and Orange.",Eyes Wide Shut

The media made it out to be like it was some kind of porno where cruise and kidman had sex through the whole movie. It was so much more then just sex though.After getting stoned, Alice Harford (Kidman) tells Dr. Bill Harford (Cruise) about a sexual fantasy she had with a naval officer. Then Dr. Harford receives a phone call telling him that one of his patients has just past away, and his sexual odyssey begins which eventually leads him to a gathering of some sort of cult where the infamous orgy scene takes place. So the film could be rated R instead of NC-17, this scene was severely edited.As with any Kubrick film, the music blended in perfectly. Cruise and Kidman were excellent. And, of course, Kubrick's directing was amazing. I only wonder how much better this film would have been if Kubrick was still alive to tinker with it.

Do we really need two and one-half hours of boredom to tell us that relationships reach a point where the humanity and vulnerability of those involved is either accepted with compassion or rejected and lead to a breakup? Can this be interpreted as an anti-feminine film? (Wheatly was known for it.) Where the hell are Germaine, Betty and Gloria when we need them?

Franck (Soysoy), I felt posted a very good understanding of the character, but I feel this poster missed the big picture. Before seeing the film I was shocked that Cruise was the lead (although I am not enamored with Matthew Modine either). But after seeing the film, I have come to realize that Cruise was the perfect choice for the role.Cruise, like so many actors (even some I enjoy like Christopher Walken) can only play one role. With Cruise it is the popular (cliche charm) and boyish (immature and shallow) leading man. Lucky for him, this may be the most common hollywood role. This is the exact character that Kubrick is making fun of while exploring in EWS.Alice opens his eyes (that he must keep wide shut), in the beginning bedroom scene, to the fact that his conceptions of love and how a woman feels are shallow conventional concoctions and thus he has no clue what the reality is. Bill says, "" I don't want to put it into words."" He does not want to screw around with all these thoughts he just wants to screw Alice. She laughs at him; she understands his world while he is clueless of hers. The glasses she wears are a hint to her ability to see through her husband. Dr. Harford is just a shell, like the mask that he finds sleeping next to Alice.By the end of the film, after all of Bill's adventures and his confession, Bill is lost and lays himself at the feet of his much more sophisticated wife. She seems regretful that she ever made him think about all of this (by confessing to him about an infidelity) and just wants to go back to the shallow but stable relationship they've always had.

It lacks the profundity that it so desperately strives for.  When an artist shoots for deep meaning on film and misses, the result isn't pretty.To my eye, the truest scenes were the most mundane; and the best acting by the child in the family scenes.  It may well be that a man hearing his wife's confession would act as did Tom Cruise's character in this film but the bizarre nature of the action failed the Oscar Wilde dictum concerning the willing suspension of disbelief.Many persons who commented on this movie take pains to say that the story is not about sexual depravity but about the nature of the relationship between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in the film.  My view is that only exceptional storytellers in rare, inspired moments can tell a story with so little reference to the theme and yet let the audience feel as though they have discovered it for themselves.  It can happen, but Kubrick sadly did not attain this in his final work, and the result is that most of the film does not drive the story or explain the theme but is simply excess.I also agree with many who thought the soundtrack was more annoying than mood-setting.All in all, I feel that Stanley Kubrick reached for the stars and came up without them, and without even the moon, rather simply with a vacuum.",Eyes Wide Shut

1152,sarlow,Rubbish,1,29 April 2006,"I've seen the awe inspiring 2001 and the hard hitting Full metal jacket, I find it hard to believe that Kubrick directed this nonsense, Cruise is a movie star but doesn't have the acting credentials to pull of this movie whereas Kidman is just eye candy, the movie just seem to meander on, none of the lead elicit any sympathy while the strange sexual cabal that Cruise finds himself involved in comes across as contrived. As are the supposed moments of ethos, especially when he confronts Amanda Curren's corpse.Overall an unpleasant movie despite the presence of eye candy, a massive disappointing finale to Kubrick's glittering career.",Eyes Wide Shut
1153,Dalmatinac,"Intelligent, Amazing, Life Time Interesting",8,10 April 2001,"For the first time, first Kubrick's movie... How could I wish for better start. The title of the movie say to me that the main message of it is in conciliation. That effects great on a marriage between Dr.Bill and Alice Hartford. Eyes Wide Shut is a title that greatly say and point out that need for conciliation between a couple on some parts of relationship. The line the couple should follow is sex (between them). The end it's self, says much of where's there a threat of dreams for them. Again this thought is well in the air: 'Women are rotten and men are fools'. I love the movies saying that ultimate truth. (me? -male)All begins with attack of 'the rotten' one on a 'fool' cause of the lack of suspicion Alice gets from Bill. Then Bill gets in his face all the strings her fidelity stands on. Alice mighty say: ""...and I hardly even mooove."" Oh Nicole, my rotten one. Bill then gets in a numerous situations to get even with Alice. Along with other circumstances, he on his journey of understanding fidelity, gets immediately hit by a girl he hardly knows, get saved from getting HIV virus, get hit by sexual ethics on his head in a store. Near the end he discovers that he and his family were saved by a beautiful redhead who's paid it with her life. Through all that time he is terribly confused by meaning and using of fidelity and cost of unfidelity. Remember the time he got home from the orgy and find Alice smiling and laughing in her dream. He awakes her and she turns cry wildly 'Oh honey I just dreamt of being in the middle of gang-bang and smiling in your face.' Oh yes, the rotten one in her very best! Then, she at home has prepared him a little surprise as a mask on his pillow that he lost and which in a first place say nothing. At that sight, even Alice is asleep, young doctor crashed on her feeling guitly (of nothing he had done!). But, what would happened it Bill have discovered 'what where rainbow ends' on a start of a movie??I loved Sydney Pollack's acting.I will have to learn more of Kubrick's work to know how to describe all his skill. It's easily seen that he shows all the scenes constantly on high level. It's amazing how the movie isn't boring at all, very much smooth on it's all length with the slight cut on the end. Music is grand here.I heard Stanley Kubrick was perfectionist. Who can mess with that? Only rotten can...",Eyes Wide Shut
1154,stro2425,The movie can be viewed in multiple ways.,10,30 May 2006,"Replace the adults at the secret gathering with kids and you have a profound movie. Was Kubrick trying to expose pedophilia amongst powerful people? Who knows, but it makes the movie much more profound. It explains why Dr. Bill's life is threatened. Also, turn on the closed captions when the young girl whispers in Cruise's ear. She tells him to get a cloak lined with Ermine. Ermine was worn by royalty. It also symbolizes moral purity or innocence. Why does the movie use pedophilia as bookends for the orgy scene? The movie is spooky, and also unbelievably complex. There is a strange amount of ""Grail"" imagery in the prostitute scene. Notice the immense amount of ""V's"" in the entire scene from her clothes to the way the Christmas lights are hung. Before the orgy there are also two road signs which have a ""V"" and an upside down ""V"" symbolizing the masculine and the feminine.Overall, the movie is about much more than relationships and sex. It is sort of like a Da Vinci painting. It's true meaning may take years to figure out.",Eyes Wide Shut
1155,farmakakistryfon,More real than you want to believe - OPEN YOUR EYES,10,18 February 2019,"I've been reading a lot of the users' reviews about this film and I have noticed that all of them revolve either around the cinematography aspects or the symbolic aspects of sexualism in the film, however anyone wishes to interpret them. I hate to break it to you people, but this film is more real than you want to believe. The question you should start asking yourself is why did the great master Stanley Kubrick choose his last film, and his greatest as he called it, to have this particular theme, and I mean the theme of secret, all-powerfull, societies? The obvious answer, which is the true one in this case, is because he deemed it to be an issue of extreme importance, probably of utter importance. Secretive cults, which use sophisticated and brutal mind programming techniques to control its members, starting from when they are infants and continuing throughout their whole lives are here, are real and are extremely widespread. They have their Manchurian Candidates all over our most important institutions and in the highest levels of government all over the world. They have a very concise plan to take over the world and they are meticulously working towards their sinister goal. You don't need to believe me, because who am I anyway? You can start by reading the works of brave individuals, such as Professor of psychology in the University Of Utah Hospital Dr. D. Corydon Hammond, who after working for years with patients who were trying to escape from the ""family"" decided to disclose everything to his colleagues in a conference. He never spoke about it again. You can read testimonies of very brave and lucky survivors (lucky as Dr William in the film --remember the scene where he starts reading a newspaper with a huge front-page title saying ""LUCKY TO BE ALIVE""? is a very good web resource about all this). By the way, Kubrick himself died suddenly before the film's official release. We are not even sure we watched what he wanted us to watch.
Don't forget to also check out another revealing film with the same theme, ""The Brotherhood of the Bell"", as well as the rare Discovery Channel documentary ""Conspiracy of Silence"". I also suggest the documentary film ""From JFK to 9/11, everything is a rich man's trick"" available (after continuous efforts to silence it) in YouTube. As the great Kubrick himself says to all of us with our eyes wide shut people, WAKE UP!",Eyes Wide Shut
1156,superg22,I AM THE NEXT KUBRICK,7,24 March 2001,actually thats a lie.there will never be another kubrick. i can only hope one day no one gets what i try to do and yet they keep paying me to do it. kubrick was like such fine wine getting better with every year. the reason people hated this movie is because they resent kubrick for what he did in 2001. he made them listen to nietzshe whether they wanted to or not. no one like to pay for a kick in the balls and thus the world of unintellectual christian camels hated fight club. they run around waving flags of their virtue and then they go home molest their children and rage about how directors are ruining the youth of america. while all of yall are really understanding the sexual aspect of the movie there is also a much larger aspect to this movie. that aspect is the celit-pagan sex ritual that they perform in the mansion. now paganism is directly related to freemasonry. if u noticed everyone at the mansion was a very wealthy man. so it was millionaires having animal annonymous sex with hookers and other various miscarriages.then when an outsider enters he is to be murdered. he is spared but why is this all so top secret. in order to get into the movie i think you would have to look into what freemasonry is all about and how it dictates the front pages of headlines everyday. i think kubrick was telling that story the most discrete way he could. in true showman fashion he dies immediately after this film or maybe even during it.we love u stanley where ever you are,Eyes Wide Shut

1164,dlombard-2,Kubrick's masterpiece of surrealist exploration into human sexuality,8,3 March 2010,"The first shot of Eyes Wide Shut (1999) epitomizes the content that is elaborated on throughout Stanley Kubrick's 154 minute drama. The shot frames Nicole Kidman inside two red drapes, wearing a black dress which she then peels off to reveal only her naked body. There is no context for this scene, and it ends abruptly when the films title appears. From the beginning there is no doubt that this movie will be about sex, in every sense and stigma of the word. The highlighting of the female form at the very start embodies the way in which Kubrick's film relies on the titillation of the viewers through graphic sexual imagery to perform its own critique and revelation of human sexuality at the turn of the century. The film utilizes both the narrative involving a married couple and their deep rooted sexual desires, as well the spectator's perception and impression of the visual articulation on screen in its display the grand scope of human sexuality and what that entails. The viewer travels down detailed avenues of the most basic of human desires and its presence in society, depicting images of adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, child exploitation and implications of fatalism at the hands of promiscuity. Kubrick utilizes every facet of film art, production and distribution to articulate his expose on human sexuality, and this film stands out as highly controversial for how it visually depicts this. The role of media saturation of sexuality in America is only a small portion of the films overarching expose on human sexual inclinations. The film's narrative revolves around the affluent lives of Dr. Bill Harford and his wife Alice, which provides the framework for Kubrick to address the virtue of the institute of marriage and the way in which people deviate from it. An integral scene in Kubrick's depiction of their marriage is a marijuana fueled argument between him and Alice regarding their respective notions of infidelity. Alice berates Bill for his implications that men and women harbor different sexual inclinations after he states that men view beautiful women, namely Alice, as simply a sexual object to be conquered, and sex is the only thing on their mind. Conversely, he feels women have an ingrained notion that sex is about security and reassurance, to which Alice is quickly and relentlessly ready to refute. She goes into depth in describing how she fantasized about a naval officer when they vacationed at Cape Cod the year before, and how she would have given everything up to have one night with this man. Kubrick deconstruct Bill's, and the viewer's, simplistic notion of gender dictating sexual desires with Alice's emotional monologue. This sets forth the rest of the film as Bill's own search for a sexual awakening once he is exposed to Alice's deepest and darkest sexual fantasies, the kind of fantasies which Bill adamantly denies at the beginning of the scene. From this scene forward is where Kubrick's sexual expedition begins, detailing the culture of sexuality in a way which no major, high-budget studio feature had attempted before. The most notorious and amazing scene in this film is the ritualistic sex party which Bill attends. He clearly cannot resist the urge to witness what his friend Nick, who plays the piano blindfolded at the party, had described to him. This is the point in the film where Kubrick's pure and natural depiction of the culture of human sexuality is transformed into an indulgent and surreal sequence of sexual fantasy. The scene features dozens of masked spectators, all circling what seems to be a very religious ritual of sexuality. Masked women circle around a man donning a bright red robe, with incense burning and a very ominous chant continues throughout. These first moments of the party feature such motifs such as masks and a religious context to further separate the previous, more human sexual experiences, and transform the theme of sexuality into an ancient pagan ritual. This kind of stark contrast between the first portions of the film defines it as overly surreal and dream-like. Bill walks through the party, witnessing explicit sexual intercourse throughout the long tracking shot. Kubrick establishes such a grandiose mansion setting to further the viewer's surrealistic and fantastical perception of the scene. The explicit nature of the aforementioned scene was too graphic for Warner to release, requiring superimpositions to avoid an NC-17 rating. But the effect on the viewer is not lost due to the changes. Just as Bill is taken completely by surprise by the events at the party, so is the viewer. As a participant in viewing this film, the viewer and the protagonist are both placed inside the dark fantasy of anonymous sexual encounters on an unbelievable scale. Kubrick leaves the viewer with so many questions about those events on screen, but all a viewer can do is interpret what such a surreal and fantastical sequence was supposed to mean within the frame of critiquing human sexuality. While the surrealistic sequence greatly contrasts Bill's other interactions throughout that night, it functions to further Kubrick's theme of sexual culture by contrasting the realities of marriage, prostitution, homophobia, and fatalism directly with the dark sexual fantasy portrayed at the mansion. This reveals the human nature of sexual desire and fantasies of such, while still grounding the narrative and its characters in their sexual reality.",Eyes Wide Shut

Replete with inconsistencies and technical errors, it is nevertheless a completely engrossing story. I hope some more knowledgeable fan can confirm my claim or correct me.Julienne Davis plays Mandy Curran who I recognize as the woman who overdosed at Ziegler' holiday party in his home. She appears to be the same woman later deceased at the morgue. Her face can be clearly seen in both sets. Abigail Good plays the mysterious woman in the large black mask at the private orgy who redeems Dr Harford.I have read several commentaries by writers who stated the mysterious woman is also Mandy Curran. I do not accept that premise. Julienne Davis and Abigail Good have very different body shapes. An apparent difference is that Miss Davis has large, soft breasts while Miss Good has smaller, upturned breasts.I never caught the name of the mysterious woman, but Ziegler said she was Mandy Curran. Dr Harford stared into Mandy Curran's unobstructed body twice, once at Ziegler's party and once at the morgue. He should have recognized Mandy Curran was not the mysterious woman at least by their very different breast shapes.Julienne Davis' Mandy Curran could have been another hired woman at the orgy, but I don't believe she was the mysterious woman.",Eyes Wide Shut

A dream you never want to end. Kubrick really know how to mesmerize us with his unforgettable use of camera and music. He puts the viewer in a state of trance and you don't even know if the things that Bill Harford (tom cruise) experience is a dream or something unexplainable. And that defines Eyes Wide Shut very well. A nonverbal experience. A message from Kubrick which is not even supposed to be explained in words. It took Kubrick 13 years to deliver Eyes Wide Shut after the release of Full Metal Jacket. In this 13 years Kubrick where very depressed sometimes and he felt like he had a big pressure to perform in his next movie. it had to be a special movie. Not just an average movie.

1169,pyota,a misunderstood masterpiece,10,12 June 2002,"i often hear ""i'm a huge kubrick fan, but eyes wide shut is just - insert abrasive adjective"". while i appreciate the subjective nature of film, if you don't at least respect eyes wide shut, you don't understand kubrick. to those who complain it was too long: stick with something which has enough stunts to hold your 10 second attention spans. kubrick may be long, but he is by no means excessively so. i can't think of a single scene in eyes wide shut which would benefit from being truncated.  and to those who try to boil the film down to one idea expressed in one sentence: that's not what he is about.. kubrick is intentionally abstract and soaks everything with ambiguity and meaning, indeed every detail is relevant. but regardless of what kubrick thinks, i believe he made a conscious effort in at least most of his work to get the viewer involved in thinking about things in a certain way rather than making an objective statement.but enough ranting .. to the film: make what you will of the dream story in its schnitzler form, kubrick as a rule only takes the skin of novels then infuses them with his own themes: contingency and failure, dehumanization, human morality and the complexities of culture. what we have on our hands is no exception, but in contrast to the dehumanization, immorality and failures of government, war, or science, here he talks about them in the context of love, relationships and wealth, entities regulated via the more important yet less tangible complexities of social norms, power structures, and culture, all morphing invisibly beyond the control of any single hand to form a web of transparent forces which control our thoughts and actions. those who succeed in understanding and manipulating these forces benefit with comfort and power. everything has its price, however, and for power you pay dearly in the currency of moral integrity.",Eyes Wide Shut
1170,Alex-Schildkret,Brilliant Film,10,8 January 2008,"This is perhaps the most underrated film in existence. It reads like a Greek tragedy in its content of sin (jealousy, envy, etc.), its consequences and the constant Dionysian excess displayed throughout the film. For example, the Doctor's arrogance and the hubris he experiences at the end. A background of simple piano strokes intensifies the dramatic effect. In many ways, the film proceeds like the great classics of the 1940s and 1950s (except for the level of nudity, of course). It's suspense is both brilliant and subtle. It is unfortunate that the masses lack the intellect required to recognize how unique this film is. The film has numerous undertones of ancient Greek plays. The masses, however cannot appreciate a film if it lacks constant special effects and tend to lack understanding of brilliant subtlety. This film took longer than the standard six month, cookie-cutter story. They do not make films like these any more.",Eyes Wide Shut
1171,macchiato_y,a demanding movie,8,26 October 2009,"Although the title is ""Eyes wide shut"", when watching this film, you have to keep your eyes wide open. This film is base on the novella 《Traumnovelle》 (Dream Story), written by Arthur Schnitzler, who Freud claimed had such an intimate affinity with. Kubrick had spent decades of time adapted the novella to the motion picture. With joint effort of two greatest minds, the film is among the most profound ones, so that requires great effort to interpret. In the very beginning of the film, Bill walked from the living room, through the bedroom, towards bathroom. This move provides us a clear establishment inside this New York couple's house. The view is clearly described by Tim Kreider as, ""The paintings that cover the Harfords' walls from floor to ceiling (painted by Kubrick's wife Christiane) almost all depict flowers or food, making explicit the function of art in their environment as mere decor-art for consumption."" Then followed, Alice, who just finished using the bathroom stand up, made her first frontal appearance. This obvious continuity between the paintings and Alice, combining the starting scene which displayed her naked back, implied that our main female character was also an art work that the main male character had collected. When Alice asked Bill why he wasn't jealous, the answer Bill gave is ""Because you are my wife and the mother of my child."" What he had in mind was that Alice was something he owned rather than the person he shared a life with. Alice talked about her fantasy to Bill that she was ready to give up every thing, including her family and her child just because of the glance of the naval officer. She was saying that in order to protest the Bill's ownership. This revealed more of the submissive position where Alice stood --- Always leading by the male. Her appearance was always associated with the mirror. As analysis in Lacan's theory:""The mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential libidinal relationship with the body image"" Alice constantly behavior of checking the mirror indicates of her loss of self-identification. She was familiar with being a wife and a mother---the ego characteristics required by the society. Alice looked like a serious person, wearing glasses, hardly smile. Not until she was on alcohol, pot or during dreaming, did the relax expression appeared on her face. From this we would know she repressed lots of her own desires, hide the tension, the anxiety deep down, so as to meet the demand of her husband and the society. However, when she was unconscious, she couldn't control of the desires and just let it out. The night, Bill came home from the orgy party, found her giggling during her sleep. But when woke up, she look very terrified. The transition from sleep to awaken is analog with the transition form unconscious to conscious. The four step of dream interpretation ""secondary revision"" could be applied to the dramatic attitude changing from being satisfied to being terrified. She feels guilty about dream cheating of her husband so she forced herself as remembering the dream as a horrific nightmare.Bill maintained his dominant poison, identified himself as the role of the saver, using money to control people such as costume shop owner, the taxi driver and ultimately since he was the only financial support of the family, using money to control Alice. When he wanted to do something that considered as immoral or transgression, he start to searching through the unconscious to find the excuses to keep him away from being guilty. The fantasies of his wife making love with the naval officer occurring three times, each followed by the action of searching other women to fulfill his sexual needs, hooking up with the prostitute, calling his late patient's daughter who expressed her desires for him before and going to the orgy party. He needed the reason for the self gratification. And the idea of revenge to his wife's fantasized infidelity severed him well. From this we can indicate that Bill indeed is a very hypocritical person. He spared no effort finding ways to satisfy his id desires while his wife Alice tried really hard to repress it. I think the scene which he found that the mask lying on his pillow implied that he, not his wife, is the person who cheated and disguised as an honest man. Every detail in this film is carefully designed. The name of prostitute the ""domino"" is actually a kind of mask, which predicted the following masque in held in the Somerton. The password of the party is ""Fidelio"", which was the Italian for faithful. It's severs as an irony because using such word as engaging into an orgy. Also, Fidelio is Beethoven' opera telling the story of how a wife risked her life to save her husband in prison from death. It predicted the result that in the end Mandy sacrificed herself to protect Bill's life. It also was using stairs as a metaphor for social class and the dirt inside the upper ones. The higher you climb, the more bodies you might discovered in their closets. Just as the saying goes: ""There is nothing accidental in Kubrick's film."" Because of the films contains numerous hidden meanings and great complexity. People who watch the film at the first time often found it very confusing. Also, during the promotion, it marketed as an erotic thriller, therefore, for people who just want to watch celebrities couple having hot steamy sex on screen would be really disappointed. It's much more sophisticated and you would notice something new when you watch it again and again.",Eyes Wide Shut

Kubrick captures some of the wonderful psychological torments that the couple faces, whether through simple dreams, as in the character of Alice played by (Nicole Kidman), or a dream-like physicality, what Bill Hartford (played by Tom Cruise) experiences.  Here is where Kubrick with Schnitzler's eloquently written novelle about dreams and the desires they create with the analytical as well as clinical portrayal of Freud's ""Interpretations of Dreams.""

They'd better realize it. It's game up. They've been exposed. People know about them. They are onto their game. And it's not going to work.All you've got to do is target the Eye. Hollywood - the people in Hollywood have been trying to warn the Americans for years! If you look at Tolkien's movie, you have this Eye on the top of a mountain. Destroy the Eye and save the world.Or (destroy) the masters. Stanley Kubrick gave up his life to expose these people. . . .RENSE: What happened to Stanley Kubrick? I don't mean the precise cause of death, but where was he going that got him into trouble with these people?FULFORD: It was the movie Eyes Wide Shut, exposing the Masonic orgies. They showed that there were people being killed. This is probably based on real events.I haven't done the proper research, but there is an old man who dies in Eyes Wide Shut. If I'm not mistaken, the man in the movie died exactly the way Stanley Kubrick died in real life, just as he finished the movie.RENSE: It is also suggested that Kubrick was involved in creating the - at least some hoaxed Apollo moon footage, and knew all about that. His wife has intimated as much since his death."" I consider myself a fan of Stanley Kubrick, and I find this revelation, while outlandish, fascinating.Admittedly, when I was a young man, I did not enjoy Eyes Wide Shut as a plodding and ludicrously turgid movie.The strange circumstance of Kubrick's March 7, 1999 death at his home -- and the family refuse to release the exact cause of death other than natural cause (may be sudden cardiac arrest) -- shortly after approving the lock on final cut and before the film was released in theatres in North America and some regions on July 16 provide a new perspective that might explain his reclusive & somewhat eccentric lifestyle beginning in the early 70's and why it led naturally to the subject of his final film.While Kubrick's genius was undoubted to some who appreciate stimulating cinematic art, he chose to relocate to Great Britain to settle as his permanent home beginning in about 1962 after having endured the experience of dealing with the stress and frustration of Hollywood large-scale production & demanding actors (Spartacus). He had not set foot on American soil sometime after the 60's since (he attended April 1968 premiere of 2001: A Space Odyssey in New York City), if the assumption is correct.Kubrick was famous for the perfectionist style in cold, detached, subliminal, psychologically inhumane and challenging cinematic aesthetics and his preferred approach to adapt the published materials for the screen. He chose Arthur Schnitzler's obscure psychosexual drama novella Traumnovelle (alternatively called Dream Story) to form the basis of the film production removed from general comprehension in plot depth more complex than his previous films.It's been several years since I saw Eyes Wide Shut for the second time, in my vain attempt to evaluate the movie on its merit in story and theme comprehension. Now that years have passed and my knowledge of the Illuminati and Zionism acquired, I have learned, by viewing the video on YouTube, the appliance of occult symbols in purposefully obscured ""satirical context"" to accentuate Kubrick's cleverly veiled use of theme on the deadly contagion of mind control, lust, corruption, avarice, deceit, treachery and power vested in the secret society conspiring to swindle, debaunch, brutalize, violate and enslave humanity in Eyes Wide Shut.While (perhaps rightly) condemned by the mystified and bored audiences for its sheer tedium and incomprehensibility of the bizarre, nonsensical story, Eyes Wide Shut may have a valid point that emerged belatedly, as the truth of the disturbing events and facts divulged and theorized in the alternative media and on the information superhighway of the Internet give our conscious mind food for thought -- the events tracing to the secret societies involving ambitious power to control financial and political businesses in governing the national and international affairs, intelligence services and occult participation within the ranks of the Illuminati, et cetera.This is precisely Mr. Kubrick's intention. The interpretation of his prophetic warnings can also be found in another film A.I. (themes of searching for maternal love, inhumanity and human extinction) which Steven Spielberg studiously developed for production soon after his friend's untimely passing.As far as the circumstance of Kubrick's death at the age of 70 is concerned, I may never know whether his death, which is still a great loss for modern cinema nine years later, was a retribution by one of the secret societies angry at the expose of the supposedly discreet activities to bring awareness to the general audience.The general audience's poor reception of Eyes Wide Shut in reaction -- complaining about the slow-moving tedium and weirdly idiotic story (especially the bedroom scene of a long-winded marital communication in drugged state, escape from the cult's grip & the last scene involving the singular utterance of F-word) -- may have brought relief to the Illuminati that depend on the trust of the controlled media not to shed the light on the treasonous activity in the long-term plan to usurp power and introduce globalist totalitarian tyranny.May Stanley Kubrick rest in eternal peace, having departed this mortal plane to leave behind his illuminating message to mankind the warning on the rise of occult tyranny and optimism in renewed hope and faith in the good of humanity.Postscript: YouTube ""kubrick illuminati symbology"" for a 9-minute video that interpret Kubrick's warning as intended.",Eyes Wide Shut
1175,hamfam-2,God-awful,1,31 January 2010,"Want to state first that Kubrick actually is my favorite director and I put Clockwork Orange, Strangelove, and Lolita up there with the best, but I have to say EWS is one of the most boring, vacuous, silly and pretentious films I have ever seen. The stupid one note soundtrack is enough to give you a migraine and the dialogue is just pathetic. If you want to know how awful the script is just look at the ""quotes"" on the IMDb page and reflect on the fact that this crap is supposed to represent the MOST INTERESTING portion of the film's dialogue. As usual, Tom Cruise couldn't act his way out of a paper bag and a huge portion of his lines consists in repeating, for no apparent reason, the last line spoken by whomever he is talking to,in a dull, uncomprehending way, such as ""... because I had you followed."" ""You ..... had me ...... followed."" As for the ""suspense"" element, the party scenes are so boring and the very idea that the whole thing could be a big secret when there are dozens of hookers, butlers, bodyguards etc. running around the scene is just too stupid to be accepted even for ""conscious suspension of disbelief"". This is a terrible film.",Eyes Wide Shut

1177,Holden_Kidman,My Favorite Movie of All Time!,10,15 July 2009,"Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is one of those that can be analyzed in every way shape and form. Even though the film wasn't a big success back when it was released (Exactly ten years ago today!!), the film has since grown and has found new fans with every viewing. I don't care what anyone says, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are perfectly cast as the wealthy secretive couple. I know a lot of people feel their pacing was very slow, but, when you think about it, Eyes Wide Shut is a very theatrical film. Basically, the film could be adapted to the stage with no problem. Cruise and Kidman took their time with each word to show the distinct emotion Bill or Alice would feel. Especially Kidman. Her lengthy monologues are beautifully seductive in the way she truthfully presents them to Bill and the audience. She is probably the most ambiguous character in the whole movie, often compared to the Hal 9000 from 2001. Both take their time to get their point across, which causes an uneasy feeling for the audience, and both have feminine attributes that control the other characters around them. Bill, on the other hand, is the type of character that you aren't sure if you want to like him or not. I know many people that understand him and feel him and yet I know others that feel he is too emotionally stiff. Both are correct. When Bill enters New York City around the witching hour, he witnesses a vain world that he would never see in the daylight. He tries to go with the flow and ends up being too voyeuristic and sticking his nose in places he shouldn't even dream of. Unlike Alice and her comparison to the Hal 9000, Bill is easily comparable to Barry Lyndon. Both Barry and Bill are too shallow for the upper society they try to take a part of. They aren't ready and both characters try to grow faster than they already are. Like The Shining, we don't root for Bill or Alice. In Fact, if any of the characters encountered a fatal attack, the audience wouldn't show sympathy. The characters in this film are sympathetic at all. I think this brings a new barrier to the way we look at character developments in other films. Kubrick took a risk and I believed it worked. Kubrick created yet another masterpiece and ended on the best note. I don't think there could have been another film that would have fit the end of the century like Kubrick's EWS. This was Kubrick's own personal favorite and I can see why! 10/10 ****/4",Eyes Wide Shut
1178,AlexDeLargeisHere,Eyes Wide Open,10,2 February 2012,"Stanley Kubrick's final film is perhaps the first of its kind: it is the only film I have watched that exists within the state of death itself. It's no surprise; Stanley Kubrick died 4 days after submitting the final print into Warner Bros., Sydney Pollock died in 2008 and my grandparents, who saw this film at a screening in 1999, are dead. However, these aren't merely the reasons this film evokes a death-like state, this film evokes a death-like state throughout Bill Harford's sexual odyssey. During the Masonic orgy, which is arguably the film's center-piece, women are used and discarded as corpses who are only valued for their material gain. This film is shroud in ultra-violet blue, especially at the end of the film where it accentuates the characters' trembling flesh and vulnerable humanity, and the powerful red which contrasts against this blue reflects one of Kubrick's favorite themes: dominance. Perhaps it's inexplicable that Eyes Wide Shut evokes a man's dying thoughts. Ironically, this film feels more fresh and timeless than many of its contemporaries, only reaffirming the inestimable value of Kubrick's contributions to cinema and a decade of a cinematic drought aptly followed his death. It was fashionable to deride Stanley Kubrick's final film during its theatrical run, regardless of the fact that he considered it his personal favorite. It seems that the audience expected Kubrick to inundate them with gratuitous eroticism as opposed to ideas. Yet, Eyes Wide Shut has outsmarted time and the film industry itself. It was almost incongruously released a week before American Pie and the abysmal Will Smith star vehicle Wild Wild West. It continues to hold a mere 7.2/10 on IMDb in contrast to escapist science-fiction film The Matrix which holds an 8.7/10 rating and is listed in the top 30 films of all time, above Kubrick's more cerebral science-fiction classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. All of this may be due to the fact that Kubrick argued that 'Observancy is a dying art' and Eyes Wide Shut requires an attention to detail and an attention span that transcends the average summer blockbuster; it's easy to get lost in the terrifying labyrinth of Kubrick's musings. Though, unlike other films, Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut refutes the transcendent imagery and magic that is featured in the majority of Kubrick's films, even in Eyes Wide Shut itself, and strips humanity down to its fragile human core, figuratively speaking; Kubrick comes to the conclusion that when man is confronted with the cold and harsh reality, he favors comforting self-delusion and blissful ignorance.Sydney Pollock's Ziegler argues, during his amazing final monologue, that the Masonic orgies are practiced by society's elite which excludes Bill. Bill spends the duration of the film's first half attempting to engage in infidelity after his wife reveals that she was willing to choose one night with a naval officer over their future. Naturally, this enrages Bill and he spends the night attempting to fulfill his personal need to subjugate his feelings of impotence, sexual and otherwise. Even in the very beginning, when Bill walks with two models, his short stature implicitly denotes his lack of power. Bill is convinced that he has been subjected to a life of domesticity and his wife is responsible; he vows to reaffirm his masculinity. Kubrick paints long shots of New York at midnight which is designed to inspire the viewer with dread. Almost every single beautiful shot capturing the very essence of soft, warm colors in the beginning soon descends into the dark and strong colors that reflect the very dream-state many describe when they watch this film. Yet, to me, it evokes a foreboding death-like state which suggests impending doom. Bill's quest for reaffirmation of his masculinity only renders him emasculated when he enters a Masonic orgy and is rendered socially powerless by a group of the masked elite. Bill's journey neither leads him towards enlightenment nor satisfaction but humiliation and understanding that he has been domesticated by the higher classes. Ironically, his quest for sexual empowerment only led him to the understanding of social domesticity; Bill is not as influential or elite as he had initially anticipated. Not unlike the elite's perception of women; they use the high-class prostitutes as objects valued for their material value which reflects their perception of the masses that are responsible for their success. As in the beginning, when Ziegler needs Bill to revive a dying woman who almost overdoses on a combination of cocaine and heroin, Ziegler values Bill for his medical expertise which prevented trouble with the law rather than his personality. Kubrick's film argues that we live in ignorance of others perceptions of us and this is the ultimate existential fear of Harford; the elite have seen Harford unmasked, vulnerable and exposed. Pollock says 'If you knew who was there, you wouldn't sleep so well.' Kubrick has finally exposed man for who he really is; vulnerable and ignorant of the mysterious forces which govern him. The final and most playfully complex of cinema's closing lines concludes that Bill and Alice Harford have learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. They refuse to acknowledge their social impotence and would prefer for their eyes to remain wide shut, ignorant to the mysterious forces that govern them. On a more optimistic note, however, perhaps Bill's odyssey only made him aware of his vulnerability, and Kubrick evokes this through the dark imagery that recreates the sense of subjective paranoia that Bill is experiencing. Bill realizes what ultimately matters: love and family, as opposed to the power which he initially craved but only realized he was at the mercy of others' application of such social power. I'm open to many interpretations of this film, because Kubrick wanted the audience's eyes to remain wide open soon after they finished experiencing this masterpiece.",Eyes Wide Shut

1187,brettwa1,widely missed masterpiece,10,1 July 2003,"It continues to amaze me how the mediam of film in our society so clearly measures both personal and collective awareness surrounding aspects of life and the experiences it provides us. The expansive variety of responses that continues to surround Stanley Kubrick's final film "" Eyes Wide Shut "" is yet another firm example of such a measure. This film has received such extreme responses that cover all ends of the spectrum. For a particular individual to condem the film as ""boring"" and another to hail as a ""masterpiece"" confirms my theory if nothing less than accurate. It is clear that the many of the more negative responses to this film have been submitted not considering one fundamental possibility. Could it be that the filmmaker(Kubrick) is far ahead of your own personal life experiences and what he explored in this film fails to be relevent to you at this moment in time?. I do not mean this as a put down but something to carefully consider before passing judgement so quickly. Do not forget so quickly the release of Kubrick's 2001-A Space Odessey in 1968. The critics panned it and it took over 10 years before people finally caught up with what Kubrick was attempting to convey and it was then hailed as a ""Classic"". This was the direct experience of Award winning filmmaker Woddy Allen when he stated in a recent interview about Kubrick "" When I fist saw 2001...I didn't like it and I was very dissapointed. Then a couple of months later I was with a woman in Chicago who said to me what a wonderful movie this was so I saw it again and I liked it a lot more. Then a couple of years later I saw it again and thought ...Gee this really an amazing picture and that was one of the very times that I realised that "" The Artist"" was way ahead of me. Stanley Kubrick films are notorious for ""growing"" on you and leave you with an ""urge"" to re-visit them time and time again later in your life. I shall forever remain curious about all the individuals who have so quickly panned this film whether they will hold the same view in 15 or even 20 years time. A lot can happen to any individual during this time- a failed marriage, monogomy failures in thier relationships or even exposure to an underground and highly organised cult. Be cautious and reluctant to judge what you have yet to experience. Do not so quickly undermind a genius filmmaker and the level of brilliant subtley that is embodied in ""Eyes Wide Shut"". This film remains a widley missed masterpiece and if my perception about matters of the human condition are accurate, it shall remain this way for sometime to come.",Eyes Wide Shut

I think impression 10 years back would be higher, then it was now. Just because meanwhile there has been a lot of wonderful movies and expectations for movies are higher. Well. Story of movie is good, makes people to think. Acting is pretty good. But there was TOO MUCH of Tom Cruise. I wonder, Kubrick was in trouble, when he understood that this known actor cannot act at all. Well Kubrick has been taken maximum of Cruise, but still it could be better with actor who could achieve better results. Cruise is as a person really self-centered man. And I could not see him care about this former beauty queen or about his family. Same time beauty of scenes were wonderful, especially together with Kidman. Those casual day scenes, where you are sitting in toilet, sleeping, making love etc are beautiful and to waist time to show it in movies- that is wonderful art. Someone wrote here, that he would like to punch Kidman to face for that cannabis-scene. This remark shows how well Kidman has done this scene under Kubrick hand.

1191,JappJapp,For those about to be unsure,10,30 October 2003,"This film is an ingenious scenery into couple relationships and sexuality. I can't imagine another movie that has handled these themes quite this honestly, bluntly and devastatingly and also beautifully as Mr Kubricks last film.The themes that are approached are numerous but yet strangely coherent as they all combine to the basic element of the movie: sexuality. Jealousy, love, lust, possessiviness, faith - Kubrick shows all these emotions in their real complexity ripped from the ideals of one true love and such myths that are kept as sacred in these times.Why feel jealousy? What does it take away when you betray someone; Whether it is physical or even emotional, why do people generally feel possessive about their loved ones? And what is love and what is passion, lust or so forth?Eyes wide shut is directed very carefully. As Kubrick's other films, it's very subtle and there is very little pinpointing to the answers of the moral dilemmas. But, this is also the beauty of the film - one is forced to think for yourself. And to think these things: how many times have you craved for someone else than your partner? Is it worse than actually doing it just to wish for it? And your partner, what does she/he dream of?It may be difficult to understand the movie if you have never lived in a relationship and had to deal with expectations in a normal relationship. Maybe you need something more, too: you have to be a bit unsure if the current norms of the western society in marital or comparable relationships are just what a man or a woman needs.In conclusion, this film is definately worth seeing.

1195,ficklingsp,"A deeply thoughtful, multi-layered, meaningful and visually beautiful cinematic work",8,31 May 2012,"One film which I have watched on multiple occasions is Eyes Wide Shut. This was Stanley Kubrick's final film. It is one of the most challenging, underrated, misunderstood and complex cinematic works I have ever seen. Ever since it's release it's been given variegated reviews. The flawless visuals, deep themes, slow pace and eerie almost dreamlike atmosphere all captivate the viewer.The premise itself is the story of a doctor named Bill Harford played by Tom Cruise and his wife Alice played by Nicole Kidman. A wealthy and privileged couple who reside in New York with their young daughter Helena. After Alice unveils a mysterious sexual fantasy she had with another man Bill becomes distressed. A thoughtful Bill embarks on a late night sexual odyssey where he counters temptation, lust and infidelity. Before attending an outlandish orgy held by the rich and powerful of an underground cult. There he witnesses the darker side of sex and how dehumanizing and frigid it can be. After being exposed as an outsider Bill's livelihood and family become endangered causing Bill to resolve the aftermath even though he was given terse instructions not to by the cult. Rousing more thought-provocation, confusion and mystery to flow.In the end the film remains ambiguous and puzzling yet nevertheless fascinating. There are many themes to study such as jealousy, intrigue, fear, sexuality, fantasy, reality and dreams amongst a host of others such as psychology, sociology, human nature, society and so on. It's also an fascinating message on how sex has transformed into a technology e.g. the obsession with money. Many stress it to be an artistic film as well. Personally I don't think it's Kubrick's best film however it's still in there with his best. A symbolic, important and serious work. The title of the film is metaphorically relevant to the context of the film in that our eyes are literally wide shut to the truth. As the ending is quite ambiguous interpretations are left open in that the viewer can decide whether or not it has either an optimistic or pessimistic outcome. I would maturely recommend it",Eyes Wide Shut

Settings are top-notch, and the masked ball must be seen.

It has an outstanding complexity, formed by adding it's message (or messages, because we're talking about a Kubrick film) to the other features, such as the plot, setting, cast, or the image.It questions a moral problem linked to the human nature, exposed through a plot which is slowly developed, but once realized by the main characters, it fixes it's roots deeply into their perspectives and actions. Basically, every scene is a key, a piece of a puzzle that, at least in my case, has not been completed even by today. As usual, Kubrick seems to have thrown away the last piece of this puzzle, engaging the viewer to ""create"" his own piece, based on his particular perspective on the approached subject(s).It is full of hidden symbols and clues, which I haven't even spotted before watching several youtube clips about this movie. Somehow, it seems that every object has it's own part in this movie, and without it, the film couldn't be completed.

1200,johannes_schreiber,"not spoilers, but very light scene discussion",8,15 March 2005,"i have seen this movie many times, and i must say thought it awful the first couple of times. mainly because of certain parts, which contained atrocious acting, false and unbelievable scenery, (and if i didn't know Kubrick's style, i would say lack of development). it is a great film, for the scenery, the shots, the underlying Kubrick kind of stuff. but it could have been better with just a few more minutes of development. although this is one of kidman's best acting jobs, i didn't appreciate her drunk or stoned scenes, having been in college, i experienced all there is in the ways of self medicating, and no one behaves that way, the drunk party scene for lack of a better word sucked, and Sandor's accent was far from Hungarian. attention to detail is what makes a movie, and Kubrick has always been one to do just that. i am sad that this was his last film, and i can't believe those scenes passed inspection. but never mind, not really important. i grew up in NYC, and their portraying of it was bad, they tried for that mythical 1980's mayor dinkins era where it really wasn't that safe, but more than that painted a picture which some out of towner who had never been there might describe to a friend. where was the sketchy 42 st and 8th ave they were aiming for? as i watched the movie more times, i started to not pay attention to this tidbit, because it really just made me angry, but more-so i found myself watching it only for the interaction with the sect in the beautiful mansion, (which is also not NYC or out lying territory style. i believe it is in england somewhere)and later in the film the conversation with Ziegler at his apartment. this is Kubrick at his finest: pure eye candy, the house, the robes and masks, the women, the music, the chanting, i've been trying to find out whether the chanting is taken from some other work? (if anyone that reads this knows anything about the music from the ceremony starting the orgy, particularly the chanting of the man in red, please tell me, my email is listed above.) people's fascination with sects, call them what you want, Illuminati, masons, weirdos whatever, this keeps people watching, wondering, hoping that one day the may be redeemed amidst a group of robe and mask clad fornicators.",Eyes Wide Shut
1201,cole-hessler,Underrated,9,18 March 2018,"I was led to believe for a long time that this was a bad film that was not worth my time. I can see how this movie could be divisive, but I think it is well worth the time. I feel that what the movie is really trying to say is hidden under the symbolism. This film is chock full of crazy stuff that I do not have the space to mention here. I was so impressed with this film that I decided to read the novel it was based on, Dream Story by Arthur Schnitzler. Other than a few things, this is an extremely faithful adaptation of the story, and many of the problems people had with the film they would find in the book as well. Except for Tom Cruise, of course.",Eyes Wide Shut
1202,duxcorvan,Boring till death,2,30 March 2005,"If you were anxiously waiting to see Nicole Kidman's butt, you are lucky. If you hoped to see a pretentious and petulant exercise on self satisfaction, then you'll be as unhappy as you like to be. If you expected this to be a posthumous masterwork given to humanity by a genius in his death bed, or simply have a nice time, forget it.As a man, I had never seen so many pretty naked girls together and felt so much boredom and watched so many uninspiring erotic scenes as in this movie. The characters, their psychology, is so strange to human condition that only fully grown weirdos can recognize themselves in the childish woman that feels so dazzled about the most unimaginative of fantasies and the hot poor rich boy that never meets the goal.The 'peak' scenes seem part of one of those soft-core porn sketches starred by Hugh Pfeffner's monthly Playmates, and Cruise is exactly the kind of guy you REALLY WANT to be vexed and killed instead of a chick, to save you from seeing him the rest of the movie, so unbearable he is.The movie really needed to command it in the title: ""Eyes wide shut!"". You had to remember that command constantly to actually avoid closing your eyes and bothering the tiny-beard pipe-smoking smart boys of the forward row with your snores.Rent a true porn movie instead, interpretations are the same as bad, but at least the guy in the film gets the prize and looks more relieved than than the stressed Cruise.Oh, yes, but the work is technically impressive in its sheer academic-ism.",Eyes Wide Shut

1204,felipe_dias,Misunderstood,10,10 May 2005,"It always amazes me how this film has been misunderstood by so many people. The proof of that is that the highest votes on IMDb for this film has been given to males under 18 and the lowest by females in general, most noticeably over 45. I must say, though - Eyes Wide Shut has very little to do with sex and very much to do with relationships. Of course sex has a lot to do with it, especially if viewed from a Freudian perspective, but the film's main focus is on the nature and limits of relationships. What is cheating? Is thinking about other people cheating? Where lies the limit between thinking and doing? Does Dr. Bill cheat on Alice anymore than she does on him? What is acceptable in terms of sexual fantasy? To what extent our sexual frustrations, aspirations and ethics is dependent primarily on preconceived social values? Eyes Wide Shut raises all these important questions and there resides its greatness.",Eyes Wide Shut
1205,saeedpr-55344,Sin rules on the society but the Love Will save us,10,23 May 2020,"The most important thing about this film is ""Society"" and ""City"" the film begins in the high-level part of the city where the doctor has a big house and goed to a luyand beautiful dance party, but as the film continues we go out of this beauty, first we go with the character to anonymous dark room in that party that has no connection with the other beautiful things in that house, in that room we see the dark side of the party and the dark side of the people in this party and beside that even before the room parts we see that the doctor and his wife has the potential of making sins and cheating each other
The first part of the film makes a good guide to the whole movie as we saw in the first part in the party the beautiful things are the things that we saw the first and after that we went deeper and saw the darkness and dark parts, the whole movies is like that too, after seeing the doctor's beautiful shining House we go to another house, the girls house whom the doctor goes, a tiny little house in the very bad part of the city, and we saw that the house has a feeling of sin and darkness and and that is the complete opposite of what doctors house look like with a little girl and very shining furnitures and paintings and other stuff that is complete bright
But as the film goes on, we go underground to a caffe, and their we knew that they are also deeper and darker parts in that society and City
the doctor wants to go that dark parts and we the audience who are mostly living actually like the doctor in a not very very bad situation, we go to the darker and deeper parts with the doctor and that is where our and the doctors reactions are the same, both of us are petrified and terrified of what see in that big Castle out of the city made in the darkness.
Remember the scenes of the custom shop where where the second time actually was shocked from what we saw like the doctor because it's a fully horrible situation the human beings and morality has no import place in the society
so the film is about sins the society and the dark parts of the society what is not seenable in the very first part, but if you go deeper you will see the dark parts of the city, with all that the film also gives us a hope, hope of love that hope of trueness, because the doctor didn't make sin and didn't cheat on her wife and that good thing happened to save him, and that is the thing that will save us from this horrible situation: kindness, goodness, and love",Eyes Wide Shut

Simply a dream like world.It's not just a piece of film but a creation of an universe in its own. The pieces of edited shots can be broken into its genesis from Blocking to Set Design to Lighting keeping a color temperature to it's story. Having an intricate sound mix to it's classic sexy noiric piano synths, really rising the tension. It's christmas, hence another reason for the film to be colorful & open to unlimited layered stories. From his wife's dream to his reality which seems like a dream. Why? Does it seem like a dream. Why? Because the events occurred in this film, can only happen in a film. All created in a rented film studio with a film crew. Sorry, I know the film is yelling Renaissance Architecture & we know Stanley's love for classical architecture & art. I mean this film is a genre in itself. This dream like reality is great study in direction as the characters seem slower & intense than other films i have seen. It seems like Kubrick didn't rush anything. He tried to keep it as real as possible. Audience feeling like they are part of a 2 hour epic. Who makes an audience feel like that anymore. With its music to static melodramatic & tired performances with a charisma that only actors with a lot of experience can bring. Completely losing themselves in this people. Bill & Alice.All this filmmaking breakdown is a research of 120 hours. And I am still in the First Hour.But I tell you cinema lovers, this creation is something else. Not all people in their lifetime will watch it. I feel special watching this.Stanley kubrick's last film.Can be the best last film of any director. Easily.Please, release this in theaters everywhere.",Eyes Wide Shut
1208,mariacp-18078,different and great,9,1 July 2017,"The reason Stanley Kubrick is such a great director, is because he is able to make something completely different from every movie he already made. This is even more true for Eyes Wide Shut. You don't know what to expect. This movie surprised me in a strange, pleasing and fantastic way. I didn't expect such a movie and I didn't expect it to be so good. I'm not a huge fan neither of Nicole Kidman nor of Tom Cruise but they were both great. As expected, photography and cut were even greater. An absolute must see.",Eyes Wide Shut
1209,Kihapkack,You CRUISE You Lose,5,29 July 2005,"The story was fabulous. I really liked the idea of a couple thinking about infidelity instead of actually doing the act...that was more interesting than a real affair. The LIGHTING WAS INCREDIBLE! I loved the dazzling blues with occasional splashes of orange. The locations were well chosen too. The women in the omen orgy scene were a little on the stick side, but I'm just saying that because I wish I were that skinny. Nicole was impressive, especially the part where she gets high. I liked how she went off on Tom, who was way too rigid. She was totally lost in her character and he was still confused and not giving himself over to anything. I think this movie was too deep for him. And on the DVD it's interesting to watch the interviews because that was back in 1999 and he talked about their marriage being strong enough to be able to stand working together. I wonder what he thinks now! I also see why famous people don't like interviews. Anything said in an interview is on public display and could sound incriminating at a later date. Anyway, I feel the movie could have been a lot better with a different actor to play Bill. Cruise was not the right choice. To the film's credit, however, it was one of the first time that I actually looked for the name of the person who did the production design and lights...although I don't remember their names. Too bad this film was wasted on Cruise.",Eyes Wide Shut

It was a so unique scene. I watched that fifteen minutes nearly without blink my eyes.

1212,andrewtempleton,an extended gag,7,11 November 2006,"His last film - Eyes Wide Shut - starts with an iconic, Kubrick moment: framed in a doorway and with her back to us, Nicole Kidman drops her dress to the ground. She is naked but she never turns around. We never see her (assuredly) delightful body from the front.This image - and the action of Kidman dropping her dress - is a neat and effective summary for the entire film. Eyes Wide Shut is one long tease, a tease that expertly plays with the audience's expectations (expectations which are also built up by the marketing campaign - which was completely misleading as to the film's content). Kidman's dress falls easily to the floor and the viewer is immediately primed for an erotic thrill-ride. They couldn't be more wrong. Just as Nicole never turns around, Eyes Wide Shut never allows either of its central characters (and by extension, vicariously, us) to achieve sexual gratification.Kidman's character has a re-occurring fantasy of a sexual encounter with a sailor - a fantasy that we can be fairly safe in assuming is never consummated. Driven by a jealousy over his wife's fantasy life (and no doubt by a desire to hurt Kidman's character for the cruel things she says to him), Tom Cruise's ""Dr Bill"" goes on a series of escalating sexual adventures to get laid - but each time he is frustrated. He never has sex. Neither of them do during the entire movie - with each other or with strangers, thus making Kidman's last line in the film at once predictable and perfect. It is the punch-line we've been waiting for. What these over-achieving, angst-ridden, New York WASPs need to do is simply f**k.The movie works its way to this punch-line extremely well. I understand a lot of people find the movie slow. I think this is fair comment and can be attributed to the movie's one major flaw: Tom Cruise. His performance is mannered and unbelievable. I wonder if Cruise fully appreciated the depth of the material he was working with. If he did, I saw no sense of connection between the actor and the character he was playing. Cruise - such an icon himself - is never believable as the husband driven by jealousy into more and more desperate situations. According to an interview I read, Kubrick and his co-creator came up with the surname ""Harford"" because Kubrick wanted a Harrison Ford-like actor for the role (ie Har & Ford). I can't help wondering if the keeping of the name is not a sly comment from the director saying ""you're watching Cruise, but imagine Harrison Ford"". Ford would have been a much stronger choice and I can imagine Kubrick getting a much more nuanced performance than he did from Cruise. Alas, Ford would have been a bit long in the tooth at the time of filming. Kidman, it should be said, is wonderful but she almost always is.There is one other glaring flaw with the film - at least in the version I saw. At one point, Cruise crashes an elaborate orgy/sex-party at a mansion. It would seem in Kubrick's original, there were a number of (reasonably) graphic sex scenes. In the North American version I saw, computer generated images of party-goers were placed in front of these sex scenes. I can't help but see this as akin to someone coming along with a magic marker and running thick black lines down the film-stock. These peculiar CGI figures are noticeably out of place (I noticed them and was unaware at the time of viewing that they were computer-generated) and, more importantly, undermines the thematic impact of the scene. The key here is that Dr Bill is not engaging in the sex, he's watching. He's observing, not participating in, sexual acts that are impersonal (everyone is masked) and theatrical. We need - as audience members - to see what Halford sees, otherwise it's pretty pointless. An alternative would have to have the audience's experience replicate Halford's - in trying to see into the orgies - but to have his (and our) view blocked or frustrated. Either would have worked.Still, this is an important film and well worth-seeing. Just think of Harrison Ford when Tom grits his teeth and shows off his cheekbones",Eyes Wide Shut

Apart from the nude scenes and the never-seen-before orgies there is nothing to give you thrill. Kubrick(Director) was in no hurry while filming (with 400 days, it holds the Guinness world records for the longest continuous film shot ) so make sure you are in none while watching.

I'm still bitter that I'll never get those two hours of my life back. Just calling this film awful is not enough. The soundtrack consists of two notes, played in different octaves. Both Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman left me feeling cold; whether this was the fault of the script or their acting is unclear. The script and plot line left much to be desired, either way. At no point did I feel sympathetic toward a single character in the film. However, I will not deny that Stanley Kubrik was able to evoke strong emotions from me; I rarely finish a film loathing its characters so thoroughly. If this was the intent, I suppose I missed it. My friend and I kept watching because we felt that surely there had to be a point to it all. Instead, I was left feeling completely stupefied.

The film really proves its quality with very good performances, a screenplay that has a memorable ending, and powerful thriller moments.The film has a different technical part aspect, its cinematography is very well made, the performances of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are amazing, especially Tom Cruise´s acting, and their chemistry makes you really believe that they were together. The ambiance and lighting are also incredible with realistic scenarios and a lighting that makes you think that the hole movie is a dream, and its soundtrack it is so good that you may even not forget it.The plot of the film at first seems to be very simple, but in its second act, there are controversial or even naughty situations that make Eyes Wide Shut a ""strange"" film. Besides that, issues such as infidelity receive pretty nice focus, and a lot of elements in the scenarios also can create questions about the reality of the characters and situations that are shown.In short, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" has a classification of masterpiece for having several symbolisms, metaphors and for its unique technical part. This is one of the few cases which a film with different narrative artifacts can extract its capacity and limits to the maximum and after all this, the results are just like a masterpiece.",Eyes Wide Shut
