0,TheLittleSongbird,"The weakest of the series, but not bad as such",5,15 July 2011,"Scream 3 has some major problems but I didn't think it was that bad. The production values are great, the score and sound are still effective and the direction and performances are credible. Not to mention GhostFace returns and is still as iconic and creepy as ever. However, the story is unoriginal and rather pedestrian, and the script is weak with too many unfunny and clichéd lines. When it comes to the scares, there were moments but too many weren't as strong or as genuine. The ending is also silly and predictable, and apart from GhostFace the characters are not as interesting. All in all, not bad but disappointing. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Scream 3
1,Leofwine_draca,A film just as lacklustre as its predecessor,4,11 December 2016,"SCREAM 3 is one of those nauseating horror sequels made to cash in on the success of the films that have come before. The sole reason for these sequels is to make a quick buck and they're often poorly written, happy to bring back characters the fans already know and love so the hard work is done already. SCREAM 3 is a case in point: the only characters dwelt upon are the three returning stars from the first two films. Everyone else is interchangeable and clearly set up as victims just waiting to be knifed.The plot is pretty nonsensical and has far too many characters involved. In essence, yet another mystery killer is on the loose, this time murdering cast members of 'Stab 3', a film based on the supposed true-life killings surrounding Sidney Prescott. Yes, it's all about self-referencing once again, and although the in-jokes are thankfully cut down this time, it's still confusing, lazy, and pretty boring, to be honest. I had no idea who the director was which why I was utterly surprised that Wes Craven made this – it bears none of his trademark suspense, wit, or atmosphere, elements that made the first film in this series so good.I'm really not a main fan of the actors involved and that didn't really help me. David Arquette reprises his role of the bumbling cop, a character so annoying you want to fillet him yourself. Courtney Cox, skeletal and frightening, isn't too bad, but Neve Campbell is on auto pilot here and seems immensely bored with everything. The only actor I appreciated was Lance Henriksen, who's wasted in a minor red herring role – it's still great to see him and he ends up acting everyone off the screen anyway.Everything here seems to be toned down – from the gore (we're left with a series of moderately bloody stabbings that bear absolutely no imagination) to the suspense (non-existent) to the will-it-never-end twist ending. I really only bothered sitting through the whole thing in the interests of completeness, and to be honest I wish I hadn't bothered – SCREAM 3 is just as lacklustre as its predecessor. By now, the whole extended chase scenes involving the ghost-face killer are completely laughable and reminded me of the same year's SCARY MOVIE. Why they just didn't go ahead and make this one an out-and-out comedy I don't know.",Scream 3
2,SnoopyStyle,tired franchise,5,20 June 2014,Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) is in LA hosting his own TV show. Ghostface calls demanding to know where Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has gone. Cotton refuses and becomes his murder victim. Sidney lives in seclusion. Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) is investigating Cotton's murder. Ghostface left a picture of Sidney's mother at the crime scene. Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) goes to Hollywood where Stab 3 is being made with Dewey Riley (David Arquette) working as a technical adviser. Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) is the director. Ghostface starts killing people related to the movie even flushing Sidney out of hiding.This franchise is tired and lost the freshness of the self-referencing writing. The big addition is a doppleganger effect of the Stab cast and the real characters. Kevin Williamson is no longer involved in the writing. The jokes are half-hearted. The Hollywood people make a lot of comments about the inside baseball. They even have Jay and Silent Bob make a cameo. And Randy Meeks comes back from the dead to describe the rules about trilogies which boils down to no rules at all. At least Wes Craven is back in the director's chair. It has devolved into a game of clue. I don't particularly like the convoluted explanation of Sidney's mother. The kills aren't exciting or compelling. The new Hollywood people might as well be cannon fodder. It would have been more poetic to have Cotton Weary as the killer. His killing is probably the high point of the movie. This continues the slide for the tired franchise.,Scream 3
3,kosmasp,Comeback,4,16 October 2011,"There is a moment in this movie where a character re-appears and made me cringe in my seat. While I know it was meant to be funny, it almost took away the one really great moment Scream 2 had. I still judged the second part without considering lowering it for this really stupid concession from the filmmakers.But when I say filmmakers I should point out that K. Williamson was not involved in this. I don't think he would approve of this (but I cannot be sure about it). While it is only one moment (and as I said, was surely meant as a joke, that didn't work), the rest of the movie suffers not only from this, but from poor writing as well. And I won't even say it's the screenwriters fault, because they may have acted on orders to generate something that would appeal and please (especially the latter with that one really unnecessary scene) the fans the Scream franchise built over the years.The good thing might have been that it did actually put the franchise to rest ... until it came back of course. But at least you knew it couldn't get worse ...",Scream 3
4,Sleepin_Dragon,The almost final chapter.,9,4 August 2021,"Scream 3 is another fine slasher movie, it shows that Wes Craven truly did have a sense of humour, almost a parody of the first, it's not afraid to like fun at the characters, and it really does deliver the scares and thrills. Always great to see the original cast lineup, and all are on form, some of the newcomers are great here, I'm sure we all have our favourites.I do wonder if it had been better if the franchise came to an end here, Scream 4 isn't bad, but it's not a patch on this one. Trouble is, us fans always wanted more.The usual slick production, it's very well put together, with great use of music.Such a good watch, 9/10.",Scream 3
5,lee_eisenberg,rules for trilogies...,7,17 March 2006,"Maybe ""Scream 3"" doesn't have quite the same ring as its predecessors, but it's still really neat. This one features Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) living in LA as a crisis hot-line operator when the murders start all over again. In the process, Sidney discovers a hidden part of her family history.Remember how in the first one, we learn the rules for slasher movies (never have sex, never drink or do drugs, never say that you'll be right back)? And how in the second one, we learn the rules for sequels (higher body count, death scenes are more elaborate)? Well, now we have a rule for trilogies: all bets are off. And you'd better believe that they are here.David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Kennedy reprise their roles from the previous installments. The new additions here are Parker Posey as the woman playing Courtney Cox's character, and Lance Henriksen as a B-movie director.",Scream 3
6,jboothmillard,Scream 3,3,17 March 2005,"From director Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare on Elm Street), the first film was outstanding, the second film was okay, and this third entry, which most thought would be the last, is a let down. Basically the film begins with the death of Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) and his girlfriend Christine Hamilton (Kelly Rutherford) by a new ""Ghostface"" killer (voiced by Roger Jackson), he is looking for Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who is living secluded under a new name hidden from everyone. Dwight 'Dewey' Riley (David Arquette) meanwhile is working on the production set of Stab 3, and Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) shows up hoping to investigate the new case as the killer seems to be killing the victims in the order of the new film script. Eventually Sidney comes out of hiding after being called by the killer, and now the three of them, the cops, including Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey), and the cast members under threat, including Angelina Tyler (Emily Mortimer) and Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), are waiting for the next move. After numerous and often repetitive chases and killings the killer, and finding out that Sidney's mother Maureen Roberts (Lynn McRee) used to be an actress, explaining her sleeping around. In the end we find out that the one behind it all is Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), who reveals himself as Sidney's outcast brother, and who encouraged Billy Loomis to go mad, slightly ridiculous. Also starring Lance Henriksen as John Milton, Matt Keeslar as Tom Prinze, Jenny McCarthy as Sarah Darling, Deon Richmond as Tyson Fox, Family Guy's Patrick Warburton as Steven Stone, Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks (from beyond the grave on video), Jason Mewes as Jay, Kevin Smith as Silent Bob, Carrie Fisher as Bianca, Roger Corman as Studio Executive, Heather Matarazzo as Martha Meeks, Lawrence Hecht as Neil Prescott and Richmond Arquette, David's brother as Student. One or two of the deaths are alright, but it feels just like a repeat of the previous stuff, the acting and scripting could have been much better, and it just isn't as witty and original as the first one was creating a new way to make scary movies. To be honest, I only knew of and wanted to see it because I saw the brief spoof in Scary Movie before it, and it turned out to be a bit of a terrible horror comedy. Adequate!",Scream 3
7,Tweekums,The end of the trilogy... for a while,7,2 October 2019,"Following the events of 'Scream' and 'Scream 2' Sidney Prescott is living a reclusive life in rural California. That doesn't mean the killing has stopped though... the film 'Stab 3', inspired by the original murders is being shot in Hollywood and a new Ghost face is targeting its stars. At each murder scene a photograph of Sidney's mother is found. The killer is trying to get to Sidney but before she breaks cover and goes to LA more people will die. Sidney isn't the only character from the original films to return; Dewey is already working as an advisor on 'Stab 3' and a police officer invites reporter Gale Weathers to help him with his investigation.I enjoyed this sequel despite the fact that it lacks the expected level of gore and even though it is stated that anybody can die in the third part of a trilogy I didn't really think any of the returning characters would be likely to die. The film does deliver some scares and it nicely plays with the 'movie of the movie' within the movie idea; especially fun were scenes where characters interacted with the actor's playing them in 'Stab 3'. The scenes between Gale and the actress playing her were particularly amusing as the latter kept accusing the real Gale of being out of character... it all gets very meta at times! The cast, both regulars and new members are solid; never taking things too seriously but similarly not playing it too tongue-in-cheek. Overall I'd say that this is weaker than the first two films but it is fun enough if you are a 'Scream' fan.",Scream 3
8,BA_Harrison,"It's definitely NOT a scream, baby!",4,15 November 2009,"When the cast of Stab 3, a Hollywood slasher based on the Woodsboro murders, begin to be murdered by a mask wearing maniac, seasoned victim Sidney Prescott comes out of hiding to help try and catch the killer.In part three of Wes Craven's Scream series, a video cassette recorded before his death shows movie nerd Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) warning possible future victims about the rules of the horror trilogy: the killer will be super human; anyone, including the main character, can die; and the past will come back to haunt the survivors of the previous chapters. What Randy conveniently neglects to mention is that the third film in most trilogies is usually the worst, and Scream 3 is no exception.Scriptwriter Ehren Kruger desperately attempts to emulate the post-modern, humorous style of Kevin Williamson, who wrote the first two films, but misses the target by a mile: his script is desperately unfunny, not in the least bit scary, and even manages to cram in a couple of incongruous guest appearances that are just plain embarrassing (what the hell are Jay & Silent Bob and Carrie Fisher doing in this film? What is the relevance of the George Lucas 'joke'?).Director Wes Craven seems content to sleepwalk through his directing chores, bringing fans very little in the way of atmosphere or gore, whilst his cast put in some truly ill-conceived performances which border on self-parody (worst offender: Parker Posey as actress Jennifer Jolie). Oh, and to make matters even worse, the film is just shy of two hours long, making the whole experience even more difficult to endure.",Scream 3
9,moonspinner55,Talk-heavy and juvenile...,5,24 February 2009,"I wasn't a big admirer of the 1996 hit ""Scream"" from original writer Kevin Williamson...and yet, without Williamson, this chapter in the franchise seems to missing not only its heart but its impetus for being. There's no driving force, even with Wes Craven still locked in as director. While a Hollywood film-crew attempts to make a scary movie out of the story behind the original murders, reporter Courteney Cox Arquette investigates new killings plaguing the proceedings. Lots of in-jokes, false scares, several good-humored digs, though it begins to repeat itself and drag after the first hour, and features too much of sullen Neve Campbell in her third go-'round as unlucky Sidney. It isn't a bad picture, just a totally unnecessary one. ** from ****",Scream 3
10,Quinoa1984,Oddly enough,5,12 July 2000,"Oddly enough, this film is now released on video and DVD, in the same time It's parody version-Scary Movie (which was 20 times better than this) is in theaters.  But this film is just not that great.  So repetitive it is unwatchable for the average movie goer, but there are some incentives for the movie.  One is that the final cut is directed once again by Master Wes Craven (though I am not sure what he could've brought to this film that someone else could've).  Also, if you watch this film for the first time it is kinda funny and chilling, but that goes the same for the first Scream, which was better.  This fim had no good plot and another cheesy horror film ending that didn't make any sense.  So this is not exactly the best horror film of the year.  So why did I see this?Because Jay & Silent Bob from Kevin Smith's movies make a hilarious cameo. B",Scream 3
11,BandSAboutMovies,Not fun,4,1 September 2020,"Writer Kevin Williamson had created a five-page outline for two sequels to Scream when selling his original script, hoping that one film could become a franchise. Ehren Kruger, who wrote the American versions of The Ring threw out most of those notes. He'd finish script pages the day they were shot, which led to Wes Craven rewriting them so that the characters would at least resemble who they were in the first two films.This being a Wes Craven movie, it's at this point of the write-up that I discuss that ""production was troubled with script rewrites, occasions when pages were only ready on the day of filming, and scheduling difficulties."" Did Wes ever have a movie go smoothly?Following the Columbine High School massacre and increase worry about the impact of violent media, the script kept getting toned down. Supposedly, there was even a version where Matthew Lillard would return as Stu Macher, having survived the first film and using high schoolers to attack Sidney from prison. What they ended up with was a movie within a movie about Stab, the film version of the movie we watched in 1996.Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) contacts Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) to discuss the murder of Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) and his girlfriend Christine (Kelly Rutherford, who while being known to many from Melrose Place also played a salesgirl in Phantom of the Mall: Eric's Revenge when she was just starting her career). She decides to go to Hollywood to learn more about the story and visit the set of Stab 3, a film based on the Ghostface killings. It's also where Dewey (David Arquette) is working as an adviser.Sidney (Neve Campbell) is trying to hide out as a crisis counselor, but all the calls start again and she's pulled back to the set where most of the cast of the movie - not Scream 3, Stab 3 - get killed, like Tom Prinze (Matt Keeslar, who left acting behind to teach urology), Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy), Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey)m Angelina Tyler and Tyson Fox.I do have to say, having Posey play Cox was a genius idea and one of the few bright spots to this film (she even wore the same green dress Cox wore in the first movie), along with the conceit that someone in Hollywood pushed the original murderers over the edge. The house where this film ends is the same domicile as Halloween H20.The film never had a test screening, with the cast and crew seeing the movie for the first time at its premiere due to worries that spoilers would ruin the movie. Craven also shot three different endings, so they didn't know how the movie would wrap up.Roger Ebert would call out the reason why I disliked this movie so much. For a series that started as a smart send-up of slasher tropes, things really were rote by this point. He'd write, ""The characters are so thin, they're transparent. They function primarily to scream, split up when they should stick together, go alone into basements and dark rooms, and make ironic references to horror cliches and earlier movies in the series.""",Scream 3
12,Coventry,Thank God that's over now.,4,14 April 2004,"I wisely decided not ever to spend money to the Scream-franchise again. So, I patiently waited for this third and final installment to come on TV. Perhaps I may be one of the last persons on this world to see it, but it's not like I missed out on a great masterpiece or anything. I never really understood the popularity of this whole series anywayThe first Scream had its moments and it looked overall fresh, but the sequel already was repetitive and uninspired. Scream 3 is even worse and, in fact, it's nothing more than an obnoxious and lame Wes Craven mess. All the characters are terribly annoying, they stumble and fall every two seconds (yes, even the pull-the-carpet trick still works in Scream) and the constant spoofing and Hollywood-sarcasm only works in minuscule doses. Scream 3 is set in Hollywood where a film-crew is shooting 'Stab 3', based on the original Woodsboro killings. Cast members and former Scream survivors start to die again, while the new Ghostface is leaving pictures of Sidney's mom behind. Sidney joins Dewey and Gale Weathers in their search for the new killer and they discover that her mom once was a B-Hollywood star herselfbla bla bla! Everybody's running around like a bunch of headless chickens and, if you think the 'actors' of Stab 3 look stupid.wait until you see the Hollywood 'authority figures'! Actually, the only GOOD sequence in Scream 3 is more or less a copy/paste of the only good Scream 2 moments and involves an already dead Randy explaining (on videotape) the do's and don'ts of cinema trilogies, while using appropriate and amusing examples. Other (slightly) positive comments go out to Neve Campbell who clearly grows as an actress and  Parker Posey! She seems to be the only cast-member who doesn't take this whole joke too serious and portrays a terrific stereotypical Hollywood actress. In many ways, the whole Scream trilogy (and part 3 in particular) reminds me about Craven's New Nightmare. They're all vain and egocentric films in which Craven regards himself as some sort of horror-deity. Somebody really ought to tell him that his only REAL good movies already date from the seventies!",Scream 3
13,michaelRokeefe,"Time to cringe, scream and wale again.",3,5 May 2001,"The third time is not the charm. Wes Craven can't be expected to hit a home run every time. Maybe he tried to hard or maybe there was just nothing left to work with. After SCREAM and SCREAM 2 we end up with the scum on the bottom of the barrel. A movie is being made of the unfortunate Prescott story and the cast members are being killed off in the same order as in real life. Jeepers!Neve Campbell is about the only redeeming thing this flick has to offer. Courteney Cox looks terrific and actually turns in a fine performance. On the other hand, David Arquette is pretty pathetic this time out. Also in the cast are Patrick Dempsey, Kelly Rutherford and Jenny McCarthy. This flick might have improved if McCarthy had a larger role. Making brief appearances are Carrie Fisher, Roger Corman and even Wes Craven.",Scream 3
14,hitchcockthelegend,Oh the irony of it all...,7,4 March 2008,"After surviving the second wave of ghostface killings, Sidney Prescott has retired to the mountains to live in peace and work as a phone call therapist. Sadly for her she is about to be dragged back into the nightmare because the production of Stab 3 is rocked by murder and the killer is leaving pictures of Sidney's dead mother at the crime scenes.I have to admit that I once never gave this film much love, I loved the first two to such a degree that I felt this third and final instalment was way off being a fitting closure to what was at the time a trilogy. Yet as time has wore on I have really grown fond of the film, Parker Posey no longer annoys the hell out of me, the once jarring itch of watching the makers kill off a fave character of mine in the opening sequence is something I now view as a masterstroke, and the twisty ending that was once an irksome pest has moved on to be the perfect ""trilogy"" closure.Scream 3 has its tongue firmly in its cheek, it's aware of its number and it's aware of its formulaic root, so in spite of treading familiar ground (I mean come on gang, have you not learnt nothing from your previous experiences), the returning characters still have our undivided attention. While the transporting of the story to Hollywood, with its movie within a movie structure, is fresh and adds a new dimension to proceedings. New additions to the scary fun are Patrick Dempsey, Emily Mortimer, Lance Henriksen and the afore mentioned Parker Posey, and all of them add greatly to the mysterious plot unfolding.The death quotient is still high, and the Wes Craven school of whodunitry is well and truly open, and I personally feel that this one is easily the funniest film of the three, witness Jay & Silent Bob turning up, a Carrie Fisher sequence that once heard will never be forgotten, and a video appearance by passed on geek god Randy Meeks. Scream 3 closes the ""trilogy"" just fine, it's got bags of energy and a glint in its eye, now if only I could get a copy of the uncompleted Stab 3 off the internet - and if only there wasn't to be a part 4 further down the line... 7/10",Scream 3
15,Theo Robertson,Rather Dire,4,31 July 2005,Screenwriter Kevin Williamson had nothing to do with writing this sequel but even if he had I doubt if he would have been able to improve it much . The fundamental problem with SCREAM 3 is that we've seen it all before . There's a pre title credit sequence telephone conversation that climaxes in death and then we're on a set of a movie which eventually ends with cast members getting killed one by one . We know where everything is heading but the attempts to hold our attention are rather lame . For example one of the characters sees the masked killer coming towards and guess what ? It's a dream which is something that rings of pathetic story telling . We also get a cameo from Jay and Bob from the Kevin Smith movies which leaves a feeling of doubt that the producers we're getting a bit desperate in the gimmick department . The climax is somewhat watchable but is let down by the fact that Sidney probably didn't need saving after all and the finale was written just so the murderer could explain his motives . For a film franchise that shouts how clever and post modernist it tries to be the producers should know about the law of diminishing returns . Haven't they seen THE GODFATHER 3 ?,Scream 3
16,Doylenf,Satisfying chills in same tradition as the first two entries...,6,22 October 2007,"NEVE CAMPBELL is again being stalked by a killer, this time when she returns to the sound stages where ""Stab 3"" is in preparation for filming. COURTENEY COX is again on hand as an intrepid reporter and David ARQUETTE is back as Campbell's protector, who needs protection himself from the caped killer trying to murder most of the cast.It's strictly Halloween stuff for slasher fans, this time a little more suspenseful than SCREAM 2, with a tighter script and better direction.CARRIE FISHER has a fun two minute segment looking up someone's name under ""Reynolds"". But along with some sly humor, it's the scary stuff that still works pretty well despite the sameness of the theme.PATRICK DEMPSEY makes a good impression as a police lieutenant who actually becomes one of the suspects. The revelation of the killer's motive doesn't quite ring true, but there are hints along the way that make it seem somewhat probable.Summing up: The Wes Craven touch is evident.",Scream 3
17,preppy-3,"Sad, depressing and insulting",1,8 February 2000,"The most insulting horror film since ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"". Also a real sad ending to a great series. This movie involves the filming of ""Stab 3"" based on the events from ""Scream"". Sidney is in hiding and the masked killer shows up looking for her and starts to kill everyone involved with the movie. The story is by the numbers, some of the acting is atrocious (particularly David Arquette and Neve Campbell) and the movie constantly insults the audience's intelligence. A masked killer is running around so people naturally go walking out alone or separate in a huge house to search for the killer! Basically this is exactly the type of movie that the first two ""Scream""s made fun of! It isn't remotely scary; you don't get to know (or care) about any of the victims; the killing scenes are boring; the dialogue is HORRIBLE (I couldn't believe some of the lines!) and the final revelation of who the killer was was supremely stupid. There were a few cute lines here and there, but that can't save an entire movie. A total piece of garbage.",Scream 3
18,poolandrews,"Not as good as the first two, the formula feels a little stale here.",6,21 July 2009,"Scream 3 is set in Hollywood where talk show host Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) & Woodsboro murders suspect is brutally murdered, the cops think it may have something to do with the film 'Stab III' which is currently in production at Sunshine Studios & is a sequel to the films based on the real-life Woodsboro murders & as various cast & crew from the film are killed off by the killer they become sure of it. LAPD homicide detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) ask's news-reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) to help the investigation & she quickly teams up with her old ex Dewey Riley (David Arquette), the murders all point back to Maureen Prescott & her daughter Sidney (Neve Campbell) comes out of hiding to find out why & finally put her murder filled past to rest once & for all...Directed by Wes Craven this is the second sequel to his smash-hit horror teen slasher that practically reinvented the genre & was maybe arguably the horror film that gave the genre the kick up the backside it needed & dragged it back into the mainstream, while not as good as either the original Scream (1996) or it's immediate sequel Scream 2 (1997) this isn't a bad effort & is watchable enough in it's own right & fans of the first two films should like it although they might also start to feel they have seen it all before. The first two Scream films were written by Kevin Williamson & he did a terrific job of poking fun at the genre, using the clichés to his advantage, filling the dialogue with self referential gags & jokes & getting mileage out of the basic limited teen slasher sub genre while here writing duties went to Ehren Kruger who was apparently doing extensive rewrites even as the cameras started to roll & Scream 3 felt like Kruger was trying to copy Williamson's style a little bit too much (maybe the money men didn't want a successful money making formula changed too much?) & as such feels like a forced rehash with very deliberate jokes, narrative & plot points. The script also spends far to much time on the mystery elements & trying to fit all the regular character's in rather than the suspense & horror side of things. The one clever aspect of Scream 3 is the film within a film scenario which while not totally original works well here & I liked the idea of the actress playing Gail Weathers & Sidney Prescott actually meeting their real-life counterparts & shadowing them. The actual plot twist is rather absurd although it does sort of work in a strange random sort of way. Scream 3 just feels alright to me, there are some amusing gags & jokes, some reasonable killings, OK red herrings & plot twists & all the familiar faces are shoehorned back in here to decent effect but out of the three Scream films to date it feels the most lacklustre & by the numbers as the set-up & formula is just starting to feel a little worn out, familiar & overused.There are plenty of fun film related gags to watch out for a spot including a funny Carrie Fisher cameo, there's a Jay and Silent Bob cameo as well as legendary horror film producer Roger Corman turning up as a anti screen violence Sunrise Studios executive. Apparently Scream 3 only used 10 gallons of fake blood while the original Scream used 50 gallons while Scream 2 used 30 gallons & it shows with very little on screen gore or violence, there's a few blood soaked bodies & a brief slit throat but very little else & very little on screen gore. The murders themselves feel unoriginal & are just more of the same like the previous two Scream films with a Ghostface masked killer running around with a knife stabbing people, I could have done with a little more variety.With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 this did very well at the box office & looks very polished with nice production values. Most of the surviving cast from the previous film return with Neve Campbell shooting Drowning Mona (2000) & her Party of Five (1994 - 2000) TV show at the same time she doesn't feature as heavily here as the previous films with most of her screen time confined to the climax, David Arquette & Courtney Cox had gotten married between Scream 2 & filming this, Patrick Dempsey was apparently hired just one day before shooting began while it's always nice to see genre favourite Lance Henriksen turn up in a film.Scream 3 is a good polished slasher murder mystery with plenty of amusing & clever little touches that aren't quite as neat as it's predecessors but are still fun. I gave the original Scream eight stars out of ten, Scream 2 seven stars out of ten & I am going to give Scream 3 six stars out of ten, a good effort but the lesser of the three.

Of course, Courtney Cox could be considered a new member as she is now Courtney Cox Arquette, a wedding having been performed between Scream 2 and this one.There is not as much blood and gore, as it is mostly just trying to figure our who the killer is. Courtney Cox performs as well or better than she did in Scream 2, and is still my favorite cast member.

This prompts LAPD Homicide detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey of ""Run""), a movie buff himself, to reel in Sidney for questioning, precisely what the villains want, too! Inevitably, Gale Weathers, who enjoyed short-lived fame as the author of a book about the murders, starts snooping around the set as the corpses pile and picks up where she left off with Dewey in ""Scream 2.""Director Wes Craven and ""Arlington Road"" scenarist Ehren Kruger have carved out an above-average, razor-sharp horror comedy that brings the series full circle and offers some cutting edge commentary on the film industry as well as copycat killers. As in ""Scream,"" ""Scream 3"" indulges in Tinseltown terminology. Sequels qualify as movies that keep replicating the original, while a trilogy boasts a beginning, middle, and an end. One of the worst things about ""Scream 2"" (8/10 stars) did was killing off geeky Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), the video store clerk who dissected cinema the way that the villains did their victims. Imaginatively, Craven and Kruger have resorted to the cliché of the "" if you're seeing this video, ""I'm dead"" to resurrect Jamie in an exhilarating cameo. According to Jamie, ""In a trilogy, nobody's safe. Even the hero can die in the final chapter.""Audiences that flocked to the first two ""Scream"" movies will be delighted to know that the third installment follows the formula. The pre-credit slasher sequence in ""Scream 3"" tops previous ""Scream"" gambits and delivers the first surprise by disposing of one of the series survivors. What distinguishes ""Scream 3"" is mirror image symbolism. Everybody has a double here, and quite possibly the funniest is the hyperactive Parker Posey, whoas fictional actress Jennifer Joliedoubles as Courteney Cox's bitchy Gale Weathers. During one of their many confrontations, Jolie informs Weathers that ""Everywhere you go, I'm gonna follow you, so if he wants to kill you, you'll be there to be killed, and he won't need to kill me.""Unless you are a psychic Sherlock, you shouldn't be able either to unravel the multi-layered mystery or to guess the identity of the killer in ""Scream 3."" Unlike earlier ""Screams,"" the third entry settles for one killer rather than two. Kruger's complicated screenplay stacks up so much action and exposition that you may have to take notes to cull the clues from the red herrings. Basically, all but one of the survivors from ""Scream 2"" gets out of ""Scream 3""alive--but not without a hell of a lot of howling. Nevertheless, the resolution is pretty clever, and like ""Scream 2,"" the back story is what makes ""Scream 3"" so interesting.Appearing in cameos are Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes as Silent Bob and Jay from ""Clerk,"" ""Mallrats,"" and ""Dogma."" Craven and Kruger take the mirror image symbolism, beyond the fringe with Carrie Fisher. Cast as an embittered studio archivist with a photographic memory for faces and screen names, she explains to Jennifer Jolie and Gale Weathers that she only resembles Carrie Fisher who won the Princess Leia role in ""Star Wars"" because the real Carrie Fisher slept with George Lucas!!! Hardcore film fanatics will chuckle when they spot schlockmeister Roger Corman as an antsy studio executive who puts ""Stab 3"" on hold when the murders start and warns director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) that ""Violence in cinema is a big deal now.""Comparatively, ""Scream 3,"" a sequel to shout about, is better than ""Scream 2"" but not as good as the devastatingly original ""Scream"" (10/10) that revived the slasher genre back in 1996. At this point, Craven and company have all but painted t themselves into a corner, even though a fourth installment could conceivably be hacked out.",Scream 3
21,Boba_Fett1138,Such bad writing.,5,28 April 2011,"It's amazing what a big difference a writer can make. I mean, here we have a movie that basically features the same cast and crew from two previous movies but yet the movie feels totally different and is way worse. Thank goodness that for part 4 they brought writer Kevin Williamson back once again.It's not necessarily the story in itself that is bad but it's more the treatment of its characters and also its horrible dialog. For one, there are some absolutely pointless characters in this movie, that also suddenly completely disappear out of the story after a while. Another thing is how the familiar characters out of the first two movies have suddenly completely changed in this one. For the first part the movie is all about the Courteney Cox and David Arquette character and it wasn't until very well half way through into the movie that they suddenly seemed to realize they had to put in Neve Campbell more, since she is actually supposed to be the protagonist of the entire series and all of the movies and their story revolve around her character. But it just feels very forced all and of course the multiple rewrites that got done while shooting this movie certainly didn't helped with its end result. With also feels very forced is all of its comedy. In a way the first two movies were also already spoofing the genre but this one does it completely wrong and often in a way too goofy way. The movie also has far too many cameos in it, which becomes an huge distracting and makes it obvious that this movie was taking itself not nearly serious enough.It also really isn't much good as an horror, since the movie is lacking with its build up. Again, this is also mostly due to its writing but you can also probably blame director Wes Craven for this. It's as if this movie got done on the automatic pilot by him and he didn't had real interest in doing this third movie in the first place. Same goes for basically the entire returning cast members, who just don't impress all that much.Actually I think this movie would had been a lot better without all of the returning characters from the first movies and make this a movie on its own within the series, featuring all new characters. I say this because the idea of having the killer wander around the set of ""Stab 3"", the movie within this movie, based on the Woodsboro killings from the previous movies, could had actually worked out quite well and interesting. It would had been a new, fresh take for the series but instead it now is something that is happening in the background all, most of the time.But calling this movie horrible also wouldn't be right. It's just that this movie disappoints on about every level, when compared to the first two movies out of the series. But as a standalone movie simple fact remains that this is a quite bad and lacking genre movie as well. Thank goodness that the series didn't ended with this movie, since the series definitely deserves a far better faith than that.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Scream 3
22,Calicodreamin,All over the place,5,23 October 2019,"While I enjoyed the first two scream movies, this one falls a bit flat. There's too much going on and it just tries to hard to be relatable.

23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Not necessarily downright bad, but not up to par for the series",6,12 February 2008,"After the first made fun of slasher films(and was one, partially, as well), the second had more of such, and also tapped into sequels within said sub-genre, and with this announcing itself as the end chapter, the one that turns it from a series or a single film into a trilogy, it would be obvious to gather material from such... but hey, maybe there wasn't enough, it is revealed herein that horror trilogies are rare. What it does instead is broaden its aim(sacrificing the references and jokes, that the first two featured an abundance of, somewhat), target the movie-making business, and specifically having in-jokes from the second and the production of this. I'm not sure this was (necessarily) a bad idea, maybe it just relied on the viewers being obsessed with the series, and/or the makers wanted to take the movie-within-a-movie to another level. It almost becomes self-parody, and I'm not sure that was the best approach. It should perhaps be noted that this is the only of the three that has Comedy as one of the genres. Taking things up a notch(while I suppose I can appreciate the point of view that it was important, possibly even vital) most definitely did not help. The killer is (too) superhuman, and the inconsistencies and unexplained phenomena too glaring, and they tend to bother the viewer more than just be disregarded for the sake of enjoying the film, as with the first two. The ""grand"" quality of some of the stuff in the film, I don't know, not sure it worked out. The writing suffers more than that of the second. I'm not sure the blame lies with the new writer, according to the Trivia page, he did rewrites during production, too. A new plot device is added, and it comes off as cheap(like some of the scares) and, frankly, stupid. ""The voice's"" lines aren't as good as those of the second, definitely not as those of the first, and the killer's plan, yeah, same thing. An interesting scene or two do come out of it all, and hey, if you like stuff that pokes fun at Hollywood, knock yourself out. There is still suspense and tension, if maybe not as much as in the first two, particularly the original Scream. Campbell's character is featured less(but she is still there), with the lead taken more by Cox-Arquette, joined by Posey, somewhat. This does add to the overall story-line, and it is worth watching if you liked the first two, as long as you lower your expectations. I recommend this to fans of the first two, and urge no one to watch this before watching both. 6/10",Scream 3

You guessed it, Sidney (Neve Campbell)! Killers can't get enough of her and nor can writers apparently. In more Hollywood laziness we get a sequel in which virtually all the elements are the same. Sidney is back, as is Dewey (David Arquette), Gail (Courtney Cox), and the unknown killer in the ""Scream"" mask who disguises his voice, kills a lot of unnecessary people, then finally reveals himself and all of his motivations at the end.This movie is a rerun of a rerun so let me jump to the end. Sidney lives, Dewey lives, and Gail lives. Just like old times. I know, shocker right? The killer is Sidney's long lost brother she didn't know she had. Don't be impressed. It's just a cheap trick at being different and original. He does a long monologue rant at the end to fill us all in on his psycho reasoning. He's just as inept at killing Sidney as the previous killers were and just as crazy. Apparently, Sidney just brings the crazy out of people.Total kill count = eight including the killer.",Scream 3
25,anaconda-40658,Scream Three Times at the Horror.,3,5 May 2015,"Scream 3 (2000): Dir: Wes Craven / Cast: Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Parker Posey, Lance Henriksen: Just as the first two films we are promised more blood and guts. It opens with the filming of Stab 3, which is based upon the murders of the first two films and this time the actors are turning up dead by order of the script. The director claims that there is three versions of the script so predicting the next victim is impossible. David Arquette is the security adviser on the set of the film, and recruited again with Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers. Neve Campbell returns as Sidney who learns things about her murdered mother. Director Wes Craven is great with the identity factor but this is still more of the same. Craven was at his best with films like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream but both franchises have far run their course with dimwitted sequels. The cast play out the same roles without any new appeal with Parker Posey as an actress set to play Cox in Stab. Lance Henriksen plays a filmmaker and it is a sad decline for a guy famous for playing Bishop in Aliens. Perhaps she should study only the first film to get any positive spin. While the screenplay attempts to be clever with the whole concealed identity element it cannot take away from the total xerox that this graphic geek show eventually succumbs to. It exposes film trilogies while becoming a boring and pointless excess that one hopes will die. Score: 3 / 10",Scream 3
26,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Great ending to the series,9,13 October 2015,"Following a brutal murder, a detective's investigation into the horror movie revolving around the victims of a similar incident coincides with previous rampages and tries to find a way of stopping the ravenous killer from continuing.With a lot to really like about it and only a few mild flaws, this is a certainly fun entry in the series. One of the film's greatest strengths is the fact that the stalking scenes are suspenseful. The opening is just as good as the others which gets really going early on with the phone-call goes into the great bedroom search that is really suspenseful. There's also nothing wrong with any of the stalking scenes in here as there's a fantastic scene inside the studio where the killer chases one of the actors through the different backstage areas, and with several great ideas brought in to keep this going along in the closets and stage-doors, this one scene leaves a great impression while the assault on the house is fantastic and features a couple great scenes. The best scenes, though, come from all the stalking and chasing down at the end, from the discoveries in the basement to the chase behind the glass mirrors in the secret passageways and much more, these scenes are really entertaining. This one also has some suspense from the calls, with the twist of different voices rather than the one since it adds to whether or not the voice is real or the killer's. This one has plenty of action to it as well, including a frenetic chase through rush-hour traffic, the fantastic house assault and the big chase through the studio are all fun and give the film a fantastic pace to it. The fact that this one also decides to really fill in a couple of holes in the story nicely, and there's some fun to be had from the really good explanations, which make sense and makes this really feel like a well- rounded trilogy. These here are what the film does right as this one here doesn't have a whole lot of flaws. The biggest one is that there's a whole lot of padded time in the film, unlike the others which is way too long and seems stretched out. The beginning hallucinations don't do much, as there's no reason why these are there other than to give false scares and the ending explanations just take forever and gets too over- explained at several points, which becomes a torturous monologue to something that was perfectly understood minutes earlier. Along the lame kills that are really repetitive and don't offer up much blood and gore here, these small flaws are what keep the film down. Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",Scream 3
27,FlashCallahan,All bets are off.....,3,8 October 2016,"Sidney has surrendered to the woods, her whereabouts are unknown to everyone but Dewey, and Wes Craven. After a number of murders that seem to be related to the Woodsboro case take place on the set of Stab 3, Sid comes to Hollywood to be terrorised, find out more about her mother's death, and try to figure out how much of the barrel has been scraped making this film.....So as the videogram from Randy states that with the third part of the trilogy all bets are off and no one is safe, this is just a subliminal message to the viewer stating that there is no chore nice with this film, but you have to have a trilogy, and it's going to make a shedload any so who cares about narrative?After a quite impressive opener, it's straight to dumpsville with the narrative. Sidney gets involved for no good reason, as do the other surviving members of the cast, and in hindsight, would any of the really have gotten so involved? Just get in a car and drive far away until the killer is caught.But we can't do that, because we have to find out who is behind all this banality and what their motive is.And if it wasn't one of the poorest Scooby Doo endings I've seen, I'll re watch it with directors commentary.The cast look bored, and it all feels stale and flat, the exact opposite of the first film which reset the clock for horror films.It's a shame though because somewhere there is a good film waiting to get out, but the writing is terrible.",Scream 3

30,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Scream 3,5,8 March 2011,"I made it a deliberate attempt to want to watch the Scream Trilogy, and made it to both part one and two until I realize that Scream 3 was not on rental at the Esplanade Library, until recently when their collection extended to films rated NC16 and M18. And watching this was also partly because Wes Craven's Scream 4 is due out later this year, and going by how intricately linked the characters are from one film to the next, this went up on the must watch list lest I enter into the upcoming sequel with a large information gap missing.Scream 3 brings back the usual, and surviving cast, of the first two films, with Neve Campbell reprising her role as Sidney Prescott, now living the life of a recluse in the woods and doing so anonymously by taking up a job that only requires telephone conversations (which of course is a sign), Courteney Cox's Gale Weathers the dogged reporter now being estranged from beau Dwight Dewey Riley (David Arquette) who has resigned from the force and is now technical adviser to Hollywood's production of the Stab movie franchise, based upon the infamous Woodsbro murders that we've already seen in the first two films. Then Ghostface comes back to life and starts finishing off members of the Stab cast and crew while looking for Sidney Prescott, leaving behind the photos of Sidney's mom each time a murder gets committed, and it's down to our usual suspects to try and unravel the mystery behind the new Ghostface since they're quite sure he's been put down twice before.In some ways Wes Craven's Scream now is like a typical Scooby Doo cartoon adventure, riddled with plenty of caricatures and red herrings on suspects that will keep you guessing right up until the end, and along the way come opportunities to spook and bump off a few bodies. What's interesting here is the existence of the Stab movie cast, who adds another dimension to the film as the cast members, with recognizable names such as Jenny McCarthy, Emily Mortimer, Parker Posey and even Liev Schreiber lending a short cameo as producer, all providing a parallel to the lives of the characters that we're already acquainted with. Patrick Dempsey also makes an appearance as the requisite investigating cop too.And what this film never fails in, is the humour aspects both intentional and unintentional, and those usual bag of tricks that seemed a little tired, though no less effective in bringing about some jump scares. It does seem to drag out a little in the beginning for the story to allow us some catch up time on the current situation of all surviving cast members, before introducing us to their fictional Stab screen counterparts, and their one upmanship with each other was the best in terms of Parker Posey and Courteney Cox being the reporter Gale Weathers (or Jennifer Jolie in the Stab knock up). Events in the film start picking up its pace when Sydney Prescott reunites with the rest and things go into overdrive with set action sequencesUltimately it's still a satisfying horror-comedy romp with quite the logical explanation of how things all ties up together going back to the first movie, and as explained, how the third film in a trilogy tend to be a different ballgame altogether with rules that were meant to be broken, getting thrown out of the window from the get go. While it may not be as classic as the very first Scream movie 10 years before Scream 3, this one still had its moments as far as third films go, but I'm now quite skeptical if a fourth is necessary, and what the focus will then be given how this trilogy as of now is quite self-contained. It remains to be seen, so let's hope Wes Craven still has plenty up his sleeve.",Scream 3

If the Scream 3 gang had taken that advice, there would have been no movie, just a lot of lonely characters scattered all over California, waiting for calls."" Roger Ebert's review of Scream 3.Scream 3 is often considered to be the worst in the entire self aware slasher series. It pretty much is, but it isn't as bad as I thought it would be. The thing that gets to be annoying is because the film is connected with the fictional movie Stab 3 which is being made about the real life characters and every character is getting killed off in the order they die in the film. Only problem is that there are three different versions of the Stab 3 script and it is unknown which one the killer read. The adventure begins...Neve Campbell returns as Sidney Prescott, David Arquette returns as Dewey, and Courtney Cox Arquette (respectively) returns as Gale Weathers. So we're a step in the right direction with casting. We also get memorable appearances by Jenny McCarthy and, my personal favorite, Jay and Silent Bob. How delightfully unexpected to see one of my favorite movie duos in a Scream film. Snoogans.The franchise is still self aware, and makes a huge note of that. This time the characters exchange various dialog about a trilogy and state in a trilogy all rules are off. Anybody can die, even the lead character. Trilogies have a beginning, middle, and an end. Until Scream 4 comes in the picture.Let's face it, every movie in the series is around 110 minutes long. This one happens to be 116 minutes long. When I saw the first first film was 111 minutes long I thought ""kind of lengthy for a horror film."" Scream has proved it can handle a longer runtime because it wants to explain on the story, provide more background information, etc. The first half of Scream 3 is dull, and Neve Campbell doesn't come in to stay till about halfway in. That alone is already a letdown. I could see where they were going, but this one should've been around ninety minutes in length.I can be picky about a film's runtime, especially when the movie has a long one and doesn't go anywhere. Like Battle: Los Angeles. Some great films get a short runtime and you can clearly tell more could've been added. But films like Scream 3 get a long one when they don't need it.Still, Scream 3 is not awful. I stated the castmates I liked return, the plot is still consistent, it's just not on par with the first two. This time, I think it's acceptable to make another installment to the trilogy to try and end on a positive note. If that doesn't work. Leave it buried.Starring: Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox Arquette (respectively), Patrick Dempsey, Jenny McCarthy, Parker Posey, and Deon Richmond. Directed by: Wes Craven.",Scream 3

I know Randy says forget the past and rules, but that's pretty stupid. Because we look at movies almost like another person's life. Or we want it to be real. This just said, this is the trilogy.

Don't believe the tagline for this movie because this movie isn't the most terrifying movie in the trilogy so far. In fact just about the first scene, it still has stupid mistakes from the first two movies still going and going. This is not the final act, but for a film when it came out claiming to be the final act, it really didn't leave much of a impact. Okay so this time the plot revolves around a movie being made within a movie with actors and actresses being actors and actresses and the movie is called Stab 3. I guess because Stab 1 and 2 were big hits in the ""Scream"" storyline. There is movie references of other generic and cliché horror flicks again, but this movie itself suffers from those problems. It seemed like they were trying, but it didn't go in the direction where it could have been effective. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but some serious scenes seem pretty comedic. The movie basically relies and focuses on the surviving characters from the previous 2 movies. With more drama and more dramatic movies, but it's just so darn lame. But you just can't take any of the characters seriously in this movie, they all seem like a joke. They all seem like Scooby-Doo character except people gets killed. The movie also uses way too many jump scares with random people popping out of nowhere. The plot keeps digging and digging for stuff they can use to make the movie a great final act that it all becomes just way too far fetched. Out of the 3 this one seemed like the most tedious one, which is a shame cause it was getting a lot of hype before it came out since they claimed it to be the final act.

37,thesar-2,"Finally, I screamed, but only for my money back.",2,24 October 2009,"As 'Scream 3' opens, it automatically gets that typical sequel feeling that the series is running out of steam. That's only in the first 10 minutes or so, and unfortunately, the movie only goes downhill from there. Make that, it crashes/burns way before the ridiculous finale. Apparently, Sidney Prescott is the most wanted (for dead) woman in the world. Everyone wants to kill her. And like the 'Saw' franchise, they keep coming up with new (but highly uninventive) ways to want to kill everyone on screen just to prove they want to kill this character. As much as I am a fan of the other Craven-created series, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street,' it would be an incredible drag to see Nancy be stalked in all 7 original movies. Luckily, for more than one reason, they stopped this incessant need to murder Sidney with #3. Now all grown, Sidney follows something she mentioned in #2: living alone in isolation to prevent another killing spree, but alas, it happens again during the production of another movie-within-a-movie: Stab 3. So all the series regulars return, a la the Scooby-Doo team, to solve the ooohhh mystery of whodunit this time. This movie was awful, awful, awful. The ""clever"" cameos couldn't save this mess. Horribly edited, scenes just begin without reason and just as quickly end without conclusion. The script/dialogue was laughable and stale. Cox who looked great in #2 now looks like (probably intentionally) Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, but unfortunately the Kidder from 'Superman IV.' In other words, Cox looked like a plain mess. The suspense on who's behind the mask was gone, Kennedy's return was useless, and Posey? What theI guess no actress is perfect. Summary: it was like Craven simply gave up half-way through.

39,Robert_duder,The trilogy fizzles...while it still entertains it doesn't touch the original two films,6,27 April 2010,"Scream literally re-invented and brought back the slasher flicks of the seventies and eighties and as a devout fan of the genre, I was thrilled. Even better was the fact that Scream 2 was just about a step above the original was impressive. Both films also stacked the cast with hot, young up and coming stars, and a brilliant horror film maker (Wes Craven)and brilliant writer (Kevin Williamson.) Enter the 'final' part of the trilogy. Let's look at what has changed. Original cast...check...Wes Craven at the helm...check...Kevin Williamson...producer but not writer...hmmm interesting. Enter new writer Ehren Kruger who at this point hadn't had a lot of experience with big budget films. I don't blame Kruger for the stumble in the series necessarily. He did pen the script for both ""The Ring"" films which I adore, but then again he also penned Transformers 2 which compared to its original was nothing short of a disaster. Scream 3 is a must see but only because the trilogy as a whole is brilliant because where the series starts out in brilliance, it falls flat by the end with a lower standard of story, a rather disappointing conclusion, less variety and creativity with deaths and just extended characters that don't have the same appeal.In my opinion especially in the horror genre it's always good to have the original cast come back. I love this cast. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox (while I love her character...she looks awful in this movie), David Arquette, and Liev Schreiber however brief has a terrific scene at the beginning which will give you high hopes for the rest of the film. So enter the newcomers, the hot young cast we have come to expect from Wes Craven's Scream series and for the most part they are young, hot and decent actors but they aren't given the roles to sink their teeth into so you don't care about them. Patrick Dempsey is the head Detective on the case with an apparent crush on Campbell's Sid although that is never established nor explored whatsoever its just simply assumed. Dempsey is a great actor and they really short changed his character who could have been as good as Jerry O'Connell in Scream 2. Scott Foley is decent as young director Roman Bridger but again he never really gives us anything outstanding with his character. B-Movie King Lance Henriksen could have had an epic cameo role (think Henry Winkler in Scream 1) but instead he is drab and unimportant. Deon Richmond, Emily Mortimer, and Jenny McCarthy are just simply fodder for the Ghostface killer and they didn't give them anything to work with. I mean in the past films even the supporting cast had significant roles in the plot. The absolutely disastrous attempt to bring back fan favorite Jamie Kennedy in his role as Randy Meeks was even more disheartening and meant an awkward, forced and downright stupid cameo by Princess Diaries alumni Heather Matarazzo.So where did they go wrong? Well first and foremost the film was clearly rushed. They lost all heart and passion for the series and the genre and forced out a sub par entry to 'wrap' up the trilogy. The so called final solution to the Scream franchise was downright silly and not explained or linked together. I don't blame Wes Craven as the man is nothing short of brilliant and I don't even blame the lack Williamson at the helm of writing but simply bad timing and perhaps a rushed film schedule. Fortunately for Scream 3 it will be watched because the first two installments draw you in and make you want more. In true slasher flick style it is now official that Scream 4 (with the potential of a second trilogy) has been green lit and I couldn't be happier. Still be prepared to be let down when the screaming is over. 6/10",Scream 3
40,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It isn't as as good as its predecessors, but it's still a solid entry in its series.",7,2 March 2021,"'Scream 3 (2000)' represents a marked drop in quality from the previous 'Scream' outings, slipping into relatively dull and repetitive territory after its fairly strong opening sequence. However, Wes Craven's top-quality direction keeps things feeling fresh and fast-paced even when the narrative is at its least effective, and it actually isn't too long before the picture finds its footing as an enjoyable and engaging slasher. Though the change in writer is evident, the movie's 'trilogy' satire still works rather well and its core characters are as compelling as ever. There's a lot less of Sidney this time around, though, which is a shame; it's when she enters the picture more prominently that things really start to pick up. The film does a good job at wrapping its series up in a self-aware yet satisfying way, revisiting moments from the first flick in a suitably meta fashion. Though a couple of its retroactive reveals do overreach ever so slightly and come close to detracting from the original's stand-alone brilliance, the finale ultimately manages to tie everything off in an entertaining and, for lack of a better word, respectful way. Though it certainly isn't as good as its predecessors, it's still a solid entry in the overall series and a fun horror movie in its own right. 7/10",Scream 3
41,bowmanblue,"Don't judge it on its own, judge it as a third instalment",8,16 June 2015,"Back in 'Scream 2' one of the characters described 'sequels' as 'inferior by definition.' Many would agree with that statement. So what does that make the third instalment of a horror franchise – a genre hardly renowned for its high-brow concepts and deep and intellectual story-telling.If you're unfamiliar with the 'Scream' films, then part 3 is an odd place to start, but, on the off-chance that you're new to them, they're about a mystery killer (wearing a mask reminiscent of the 'scream' painting) stalking teenagers, normally with a view to get to the central character, played by Neve Campbell. So, here we have a film with – basically – the exact plot from the previous two (not to mention the same plot as many a slasher film around since the seventies). Yes, it's not that original, but it's still pretty good fun.For a start, it's a 'Scream' movie, therefore you still have the fun of trying to guess who's behind the mask (and there are plenty of 'red herrings' to keep you off your guard). And it maintains its humorous irony. It's always self aware and loves to parody itself and the genre it's set it. Finally, you have a decent cast (with previous cast members reprising their roles) who you actually care about.Okay, so it's neither as original as its predecessors, nor any film of the same genre, but, for a third instalment, it's actually a masterpiece. Horror films are famous for starting good then being milked for all they're worth, losing quality with each one. You could say that the quality has dropped here, but compared to all the other horror films, it's actually a masterpiece.If you like the Scream films, or just horror flicks in general, this one's right up there with the best of them. Or rather the best sequels I should say. Special mention to Parker Posey for sending herself, Courtney Cox and Gale Weathers up all in one go (and watch out for Carrie Fisher's brilliant cameo!).",Scream 3
42,Cineanalyst,Harvey Weinstein Did It,4,1 August 2021,"Having been some years since I last saw the supposed end of this so-called trilogy (obviously that didn't last, as ""Scream 4"" (2011) was made, and ""Scream 5"" is to be released in the near future), for the first half of re-watching it, I was surprised how much better it seemed than I remembered or that others panned. Much better than its film-within-the-film, ""Stab 3,"" which introduces an entirely new cast to redo what was already done in the first ""Stab."" Tori Spelling may be no ""young Meg Ryan""--I mean, I don't actually know; I've never seen ""Beverly Hills, 90210""--but at least she has an American accent--being American an' all--unlike Brit Emily Mortimer who apparently cannot do one. I'm still haunted by the horror of her being the only sibling in the all-American family of ""Our Idiot Brother"" (2011) to speak with an English accent. And, besides that, she's indeed too much the ingénue type to pull off the subversion of the virgin heroine trope required of the Sidney part. Anyways, ""Scream 3"" becomes too much of ""Stab 3"" in its latter half and is the worse for it.In light of Harvey Weinstein's subsequent rape and sexual assault convictions, the casting-couch jokes here about aspiring actresses sleeping with directors and producers to get ahead are especially disgusting. Not that they weren't already clearly in poor taste particularly considering the revelation in the film's exposition-exhausting denouement. Boy, is this third installment lacking in the absence of Kevin Williamson, who penned ""Scream"" (1996) and ""Scream 2"" (1997). The writer of this one, Ehren Kruger, has a pretty lousy résumé. The ""Scream"" franchise, too, was produced by Weinstein's Miramax/Dimension company. Rose McGowan and Heather Graham, both of whom starred in the prior ""Scream"" films, are among Weinstein's hundred-plus accusers. I've read a couple articles likewise appraising the picture in light of what we all know now and where it's argued that ""Scream 3"" is some sort of exposé in the style of the series' meta deconstructions of movies and, now, the argument being, the business of making them. It's not, though. It plays it for laughs and as a plot device in its tired whodunit formula, including a Scooby-Doo-esque old dark house for its rapist producer full of secret passages to whisk young women away. No, that's not an exposé; it's exploitation.There are a lot of less inflammatory problems with ""Scream 3,"" as well. The deaths are relatively tame, which has been blamed as a response to the Columbine massacre. Randy's video doesn't work in the way his role did as the film buff in the prior installments. The most interesting reflexive aspects of Gale's character are also abandoned--replaced merely by the boring bickering between her and beau deputy Dewey. Most of the most clever reflexivity of those films is absent here, although its concept of a film entering its film-within-the-film and the killer writing its screenplay isn't unpromising. The Jay and Silent Bob synergy cameo sucks. Carrie Fisher's cameo is odd. The voice simulator thingy is a stupid gimmick. The opening scene misses the appeal of those in the first two films and gives short shift to one of the few characters to survive those installments. Neve Campbell's Sidney is missing in action for too long, and she looks for a book to pull for a secret passageway in the producer's home even though it's never established that she'd have any clue there are such things in the house; she wasn't present when the others figured it out.The one saving grace is Parker Posey, who does make a better Gale than the ""real"" Gale now that that character has been stripped of what made her compelling. She's a perfect double for Courtney Cox, not because they look anything alike--they would've needed to cast Demi Moore for that--but because Posey is just the sort of quirky actress to pull off playing an actress shadowing the character she's to play in the film-within-the-film. The rest of the picture isn't, but Posey is a delight.",Scream 3
43,CuriosityKilledShawn,Okay end to mediocre series,5,6 August 2000,"This threequel massively improves over Scream 2. But that ain't exactly hard. The photography and direction are still very bad but Ehren Kruger's script has a few neat ideas. Unfortunately these idea are ignored in favor of ultra-cheap scares backed up by a lethally loud soundtrack. How many of these sub-genre flicks are going to resort to these cheap tricks?After a pointless, and very long opening, the film relocates from a college campus to Hollywood. The members of the STAB 3 cast are being killed by the masked one and the gratingly awful and highly clichéd 'who's the killer?' conversations follow.People are chased down dark corridorsagain. And loud noise, that is apparently music, attacks our inner ears and numbs our brains. In-jokes are lazy and not funny. Lance Henrikson is only in it for 2 seconds. And it gets quite boring. The only reason to watch this is the few decent ideas that are never realised or developed. 5/10",Scream 3

Although I believe that this movie was a little lower than the previous two movies because I expected something more from this movie in the direction of it.I also think that if you have watched the previous two movies you will understand what I mean because willingly or not the comparison between them is really inevitable.",Scream 3
47,filipemanuelneto,The ultimate scream ...,7,5 September 2015,"Two years after the deaths of the second film, and during the filming of a new movie based on the life of Sidney Prescott (who lives at large under another name), a new wave of mysterious murders shakes the film crew and all suspects a new return of the masked psycho. Sidney, suspecting that the killings have some connection with the mysterious past of his deceased mother, decides to go to Hollywood and help the authorities to face the killer. Directed by Wes Craven, has a main cast equal to that of other films.If the other films could be considered parodies, this film only has a few scenes that point in that direction. The whole film is a small crime thriller where the scary scenes don't scare enough to be a horror movie, but manage to put us in the expectation to follow the investigations and see who will be the next victim. This time, we didn't feel any sympathy for the killer because the main characters (Sidney, Dewey, Gale and even Detective Kincaid) evolved dramatically and now shown to be more mature, complex and able to reach the audience in a more effective manner. The only one with which we don't sympathize is Cotton Weary, a guy more interested in their own fame than anything else. The end of the film is remarkable, and it's surprising enough to make us wonder if it really existed, in real life, more cases similar to those of Maureen Prescott.",Scream 3
48,TheMovieDiorama,Scream 3 has done so much screaming that it has now lost its voice.,4,18 May 2019,"Oh Craven. You just never know when to stop, do you? The majority of franchises eventually hit a level of fatigue, when the premise or story rarely changes and becomes a repetitive exercise in acquiring money. As I mentioned in my 'Scream 2' review, the meta concept was losing its freshness. Well, this third instalment lost it entirely, in what was a poignant stab leaving the audience bleeding out in pure boredom. Another serial killer dressed up in the infamous ""Ghostface"" costume is after Sidney and Gale, whilst also killing the cast of 'Stab 3'.Craven lost in with this chapter. The intelligent use of meta dialogue, referencing the tropes and narrative structures found in films, was forced to the point of being eye-rolling. Yes, this sequel shoves the idea of a ""trilogy"" so far down your throat that'll you be gagging for escape. ""All bets are off"", ""descriptive unexpected backstory"" and ""the main character can be killed, so sorry Sidney"". The irony of mentioning the fact that this segment of the film was expositional was, well, conforming to that very trope. It was unshaven, glossy yet raw exposition that failed to provide any chuckles and felt wholly unnecessary. Just because the other instalments ingeniously utilised meta references does not mean this third chapter must harshly contain it. Subtlety, dammit!If you've seen the other films, then you know how this plot will play out (despite the above quotes). Another serial killer slices, dices and entices its victims in unoriginal ways that inadvertently lost the thrilling slasher element that made the series fantastic. The horror (if you can call that) consists of loud jump scares whenever someone taps another on the shoulder. Literally. Count how many times it happens! Well over seven. Heck, the kills themselves were infrequent and lame.The characters, aside from Sidney's backstory (more on that in a little bit), remained the same and lacked progression. The acting was functional, I mean Campbell and Cox were enjoyable to watch yet again as Sidney and Gale ""My Fringe Will Cause Storms"" Weathers. Arquette seemed somewhat distant in comparison to the predecessors, probably didn't care for the series at this point. Oh, and a nice cameo from the late Fisher who was sublime. Even going as far as quipping about Princess Leia. Classic.So the central spine to these films is the mystery of the serial killer. Who is if? What is it? Why is it? The killer in this film is revealed and suddenly becomes this convoluted family affair that, whilst I'm sure was a surprise for hardcore fans who have invested their lives into ""Ghostface"", just didn't connect with me. I wasn't phased. In fact, by that point in the story, I didn't care anymore. Interest was lost and the motives the killer blubbered out were flimsy and menial. Just backstory that acted as plot convenience.Suffice to say, franchise fatigue hit me hard. Nothing in this third instalment differs itself from its predecessors, following the exact same narrative structure and repetitive nature. Craven had let out his last scream, finishing a trilogy in uninspired form. Well, that is until 'Scream 4'...",Scream 3
49,BaronBl00d,Round Up the Usual Suspects,5,20 February 2005,"The whole ""Scream"" gang returns - even Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks via a videocassette. This time around a resolution is found for the problems of Neve Campbell. Although certainly the lesser installment in th Scream cycle, Scream 3 is hard not to like or enjoy. If you liked the characters and the tone of the first two movies, you will probably enjoy this one as well. It has a script which defies logic and credibility. But let's face it, you know that coming into this film. You are here to see Courtney Cox, lovely as ever, Campbell, Arquette(his funniest turn I think), and the rest plus some new comers needed to increase the body count. The most noteworthy being Jenny McCarthy in a brief but highly enjoyable role, Patrick Warburton as a bodyguard, and Lance Henrikson as a Roger Corman-like director. Oh, and by the way, Roger Corman has a cameo as a Hollywood player. Director Wes Craven doesn't seem to have as much scary juice as in the first two. I also blame the plot for that limitation. This time around the third installment of the Woodsboro murders on film called Stab 3 is the setting for much of the film. Craven is poking fun at the whole horror sequel thing - but much of that ground was tread in Scream 2. We get some pretty lame rules to the horror trilogy. How many horror trilogies have there been? I could not think of any true ones(as Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 are essentially the same film). Anyway, not a bad film not a great film but I found it to be an entertaining albeit derivative film.",Scream 3
50,insomniac_rod,A lame ending to a popular franchise.,2,10 July 2005,"Wes Craven came out with ""Scream 3"" to abuse of it's young cult and put an end to the popular franchise. Face it, Craven only created this sequel to make more money because the story doesn't offers anything new, in fact, it's somewhat a spoof of the original and the weak part 2.The best about Scream 3 are it's performances. Courteney Cox took the lead after Neve Campbell got tired of her clichéd role and to be honest, she did it great. Her husband, David Arquette did a decent job as the co-star. Parker Posey gave the funniest and best performance in the movie as the hyperactive Jennifer Jolie who plays Gale Weathers in ""Stab 3"", the fictional Slasher flick in the movie. The situations aren't tense, suspenseful, and not even entertaining. The death scenes are boring! at least the ""famous"" but boring Ghostface had some interesting killing techniques in part 1 (by the way, copied from popular Slasher flicks from the 80's). Anyways, ""Scream 3"" is a movie to skip at all costs because it's the same thing that you saw in the original and the sequel.The final chase scene is as mediocre as you can get! and the ending will get on your nerves. I can see why Neve Campbell didn't want a starring role in this mess.Think about ""Scary Movie"" with a little gore and you get ""Scream 3""!. Don't even waste your time on this.",Scream 3

52,FiendishDramaturgy,Deserving concluding trilogy chapter,9,2 October 2003,"While fully exploited and mimicked by every hack writer/director throughout the movie industry, this is series stands alone...without peer.This last installment of the ""Scream"" trilogy perpetuates the wonderfully creative job Wes Craven did in the first two. I expected the typical campy, slip-shod third installment that we usually get from Hollywood. Typically, the third ones are the worst. (Halloween 3, for example, Batman 3, Indiana Jones 3, Jurassic Park 3 all fell short of the first two installments of their series.)Again, the original cast is back. I admire that tremendously in any series, but in this one especially, as the acting quality and chemistry between these thespians is absolute magic. Randy (Jamie Kennedy) explains to his friends, his extended family, what a trilogy is all about. In doing so, he points out that this movie that is their life, is the ""concluding chapter of...(their)...trilogy."" This touch added immensely to the understanding of the facts. This movie brings together the first two movies and effectively illuminates all the evidential pieces, drawing them into a solid, cohesive story. While this last installment was a bit less shocking and scary than the first two, it was only by an infinitesimal amount. Randy's explanation is one of the key factors in the ""drawing together"" process around which this movie centers.""If you find yourself dealing with an unexpected back-story and a preponderance of exposition, then the sequel rules do NOT apply. Because you are not dealing with the sequel. You are dealing with the concluding chapter of a trilogy...true trilogies are all about going back to the beginning, and discovering something that wasn't true from the get-go. Godfather, Jedi all revealed something that we thought was true, that wasn't true.So if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some super trilogy rules. (1) You've got a killer who's going to be superhuman. Stabbing him won't work, shooting him won't work, basically you've got to cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him up. (2) Anyone, including the main character, can die. This means you, Sid. I'm sorry. It's the final chapter. It could be f**kin' Reservoir dogs by the time this thing is through. (3) The past will come back to bite you in the @ss. Whatever you think you know about the past, forget it. The past is not at rest! Any sins you think were committed in the past are about to break out and destroy you."" Randy.The new characters are just as well-developed as the originals, the plot is extremely well written and hugely effective in promoting the central purpose of this final film; that of explaining everything and bringing all thoughts, ideas and facts together. In the beginning, I thought that the character of Jennifer Jolie, portrayed by Parker Posey, was hollow, shallow and ineffective. But upon further contemplation, I realized that was true only when she was in her role as Gale Weathers. Her interpretation of Gale's personality was that GALE was hollow, shallow and unprofessional. When she is out of that character, and in her own as Jennifer, her performance is extremely good.That original thought, alone, made me dislike the entire movie. Wes Craven's characters up until that point were all very professionally developed and portrayed. I could not understand his allowing a horrid performance to grace these movies. But in retrospect, it was not like that at all. The characters portraying actors, when in the roles the actors portray, all seem lacking, but I think perhaps that may be Craven's personal comment concerning the recent run of massively ill-done rip-off's of the ""Scream"" masterpieces, and not poor performances by these actors. The rip-off's, such as ""Cut"" and ""Urban Legend: Final Cut,"" are horrid, obvious attempts to mimic the brilliance Craven presents to us. I don't blame him one bit. I would have written in a few snide comments, myself. Probably quite a bit more bold than this.The guest star appearances of Jay and Silent Bob was a lovely touch, by the way.PLOT: Sidney is ""living in the mountains like the UniBomber,"" in an attempt to have some vestige of a life. ""Killers can't kill what they can't find."" Sidney. She works as a counselor for a crisis call center, and can do this out of her home.Meanwhile, back in the city, the killings have resumed, and the case has been given to Det. Mark Kincaid of the LAPD (Patrick Dempsey), a detective interested in Hollywood and its many celebrities.Dewey works for Jennifer as security and her personal adviser, confidante and friend. He also coaches her to help her more effectively portray her character's role as Gale Weathers. Who better for the job than Gale's ex-lover?Pictures of Sidney's mother begin to turn up at each murder site; a perplexing fact which keeps Dewey's mouth tightly shut concerning Sidney's location. But when Sidney's security is unquestioningly breached, she reaches out to Dewey for that sense of connection and the security that only Dewey can give her.Gale and Dewey begin to puzzle out the mystery of Maurine Prescott's pictures, and slowly begin to put the pieces of the final puzzle together.If you liked Scream and Scream 2, this movie is a must see. It answers all the questions and throws you for a final spin that was never eluded to in the first two.Wonderful, triumphant, wildly successful conclusion to this trilogy. I highly recommend all three installments of ""Scream."" It gets a full 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",Scream 3
53,freemantle_uk,The weak link of the series,5,13 July 2013,"The Scream series became a popular series with critics and audience due to the fact it was a self-aware slasher film that knew the clichés of the genres whilst still working as a slasher film. But the third film of the series is considered the weak link of the franchise.After the events of the Woodsboro and Windsor College, a third film is being made in Hollywood to complete a trilogy. But a new killer is stalking has donned the Ghostface mark, targeting both the film cast and survivors of the Woodsboro killings, leading to Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) and her ex-boyfriend, Dewey (David Arquette) to investigate as Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is forced out of hiding after she suffers from visions of her deceased mother.The Scream series has always had a self-aware/meta element to it, but with Scream 3 its satire is taken a step too far as it takes jabs against Hollywood. The big jokes are about the production include constant re-writes to the film suffers, an actress saying she is playing a character that is 14 years younger then her, a music video director forced to make Stab 3 as his directional debut before he can make the film he wants, actors having to sleep with people to get roles and producers debating violence in films influencing real-life violence. The film just got too meta as an actor and the person she is meant to be playing arguing and talking about the rules of a trilogy. This is a film was much more focused on being a satire on Hollywood as a whole then a spoof of the horror genre.Tonally Scream 3 is lighter then previous films. There was always a comic undercurrent to the series, but it becomes much more pronounced in Scream 3 with the characters interactions and the deaths themselves were less gruesome and more over-the-top, particularly with a house getting blown up which was done in a unrealistic way and there is a sequence when Ghostface throws hi s knife and the handle hits Dewey on the head. There was even an occasional comical musical moments in score and a very overt cameo from the characters Jay and Silent Bob.I found the best bits were when Scream 3 was more serious, when we see Sidney living an isolated life in the countryside, with tons of security and works as a women's crisis counsellor: it felt like a good continuous to her story. But it does not blend well with the more comic tone and the film as a whole was struggling to justify her presence in the film. There are long period where she is not involved in the film, she is not involved at all in the first act and forces a reason to be in the film.Much of the problems of the lay at the feet of the new writer Ehren Kruger who replaced Kevin Williamson. It felt like Kruger was trying to copy Williamson's style and directed Wes Craven wanted to remake New Nightmare. The characters did feel a little compared to the previous movies and the satire/self-aware elements of the film was not as sharp to the first two movies.The acting also felt weak, with many of the actors either phoning in their performances or shouting and screaming, including a scene where the Stab actors end up acting clichéd horror victims/targets.Whilst Craven's directing is solid for the most part, a big criticism some of the sequences involving Ghostface's attacks looks like there was more then one killer, but the conclusion shows there was only one killer.At the time Scream 3 was originally meant to be a conclusion for the series and it was a disappointment due to poor script and overly comic tone.

56,meeza,Ok! But Do Not Want More Screams!,6,22 September 2000,"What is my favorite scary movie? I tell you this much it is not `Scream 3.' The finally of this creepy and creative trilogy is here! It follows the same old formula as the previous screams. Don't get me wrong, it is a good formula that works. However, it has lost its lusto. Watching `Scream 3' is like watching `Scream' and `Scream 2' again. This time the killer executes the same deaths as in the movie they are filming - `Stab 3.' I do congratulate director Wes Craven for bringing us this witty horror trilogy. However, I am glad that he has decided not to try another stab at it and make a ""`Scream 4."" *** Average",Scream 3
57,MaxBorg89,"Has a few memorable moments, but is clearly the weakest link in the Scream trilogy",6,14 April 2007,"At one point in this film, Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) makes the following remark: ""All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off"". This is evident in Scream 3, which seems to have completely slipped out of the hands of Wes Craven and Ehren Kruger (original screenwriter Kevin Williamson was left out), becoming an increasingly contrived, nonsensical mess.This time around, the masked killer starts causing mayhem on the set of Stab 3 (yes, Stab 3, unfortunately), before focusing, you've guessed it, on Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who's getting tired of being chased by lunatics all the time. And after this flick, the audience should be tired of watching the chase, too: things happen completely at random, there's no logical connection between events and characters and even the climax, which was also the main problem of Scream 2, is absolutely implausible, clear proof of the fact that this movie was made for the money rather than for the filmmakers'wish to go on with the franchise (hence Campbell's wise decision to appear less than in the previous Screams).A few scenes, however, save the film from being total rubbish: Jamie Kennedy reprising his role as film-buff Randy is still very funny, as is a brief appearance by Kevin Smith's famous Jay and Silent Bob characters (for more laughs, check out the Scream spoof in their own movie). But the real treat for hard-core movie lovers is Carrie Fisher's self-parodying cameo, probably one of the sharpest, funniest satires on the film-making business (and it's only five minutes long).Most of the time, though, Scream 3 is uninspired and dumb.

58,drownnnsoda,"Decent Finale, But Can't Compete With The First Two.",6,9 June 2007,"""Scream 3"" takes us to the Northern California hills, where Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is living in seclusion and immense fear due to the traumatic events that she survived in Woodsboro and at Windsor College. Meanwhile, a Hollywood movie studio is producing a film called ""Stab 3"", the third installment in a movie series based on the events that Sidney has survived. But when cast and crew members begin to die off one by one, it seems another killer has returned, and goes after the fragile Sidney (who is having terrifying visions of her dead mother). Sidney teams up with Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) and policeman Dewey (David Arquette), two people who survived the massacres with Sidney, and try to uncover the new killers identity, which may be linked to Sidney's past.The last installment in a very popular horror series, ""Scream 3"" brings this trilogy to end on an entertaining but rather weak note. The script for this film is nowhere near as good as the other two, which is unfortunate considering this film was the ""finale"" of the series. It would have been nice to end the series with a better film - not that this sequel is unbearably bad, but it could have been better. I will admit there are some decent scare moments and a handful of suspenseful scenes, but it seems to me that there's almost too much going on in this sequel for it's own good. The script juggles the Sidney character, Sidney's past, the Dewey/Gail relationship, the cast members of the ""Stab 3"" movie, and more, and the jumping around hurt the film a little. It didn't seem to have a central point within it, and that was a problem, for me at least.Besides the problems that it has, I still have to say that I enjoyed this movie, mostly because of the entertainment factor. The writing wasn't amazing, but it did manage to continue to have some nice plot developments and a few good twists, plus some decent scares and more slight mocking of the genre and it's rules. The setting is mainly Hollywood, so this film has a completely different atmosphere than the second or the first film. I'm not sure if it necessarily hurt the film, but it seemed a little too ""Hollywood"" for me. The cast is good here, with more returning characters and some new ones as well, mainly added for body count, while the others do develop somewhat during the movie. The twist-ending (which is the revelation of the killer's identity) made sense in terms of the story, but I found it to be a little unsatisfying.All things considered, ""Scream 3"" is an enjoyable but problematic ending to an above-average horror trilogy. You'll be entertained undoubtedly, but this movie can't compete with the second or the first films, because it just isn't as good. I enjoyed it for the most part and I have trouble over-criticizing it, but most people will agree when I say that it can't compare with the original film. 6/10.",Scream 3
59,kluseba,Good for teenage parties but a disgrace to the horror genre,4,27 April 2011,"As if the first two embarrassing instalments for the entire horror genre would not have been enough, Hollywood decided to make a couple more retarded teenagers go to the cinema and created a third part of the series that has now even come back with an unnecessary fourth part. This third movie is the worst one of the series and adds nothing new to the whole concept. The ending is even more stupid and random than the conclusion of the two predecessors. There is now a complete absence of suspense and in fact no atmosphere at all and the well developed and sympathetic characters of Weathers and Dewey are not enough to carry this movie as a bunch of really bad actors starring in the movie inside the movie put this flick even on a lower level than the stupid teenage characters have done in the past.The last twenty minutes of chasing scenes and revelations are at least entertaining and there are a few silly laughs from time to time that underline the status of a typical party movie to switch your brain completely off but those two points as well as the mentioned characters and the general entertainment of the movie that is quite easy junk food to watch if you have got nothing else to do justify my four point rating but not the success of this third flick. Even nowadays, there are so many great horror movies to find out there and people waste their time watching horror parodies with wooden acting and horrible dialogues and lack of suspense, atmosphere and intrigue. Just avoid this movie at all costs if you have a little bit of intellect and taste inside of you. I only recommend this flick for teenage parties and amusement soirées of the lowest degree.",Scream 3

I will give Scream 3 this, out of all the film's premises, this one had the most unique. It doesn't act upon it nearly as much as it could have, but it was somewhat interesting to follow nevertheless. The acting is worse than ever, with all your signature characters who haven't died yet returning- as always. The script is full of cliches, stereotypes, and such basic bland dialogue I honestly wonder if a robot wrote it. What I found largely interesting about the film is the expansion of the story of the mother, and even though we literally never see her besides in pictures and on screen, she somehow still proves to be the most interesting character this film or even franchise has to offer. There are some hilariously stupid moments throughout, as well as some incredibly predictable ones. I haven't enjoyed a single film in this franchise, it may seem sacreligious coming from a horror fan, but these films, I just can't help but feel they are so goddamn lazy. The first one was meh, the second one was awful, this one falls in between. Enjoy it if you can, but in my personal opinion, your better off watching Craven's Nightmare films instead.

67,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Pieces but Too In Your Face,7,8 October 2019,"Now this film is actually the first in the series that I saw in the theater. I caught the first two on VHS when my sister rented the first one and then I believe she had our parents buy the second one. My mother took us both to catch this one. I remember liking it during that initial viewing, but I'm pretty sure I've not seen it since. The person I was with wanted to watch a movie, so we decided on this one. The synopsis is during the production of Stab 3, the third film based on the Woodsboro murders, another Ghostface killer rises to terrorize the actors and the people they portray.I had to improvise for the synopsis as the one on the Internet Movie Database wasn't really correct. We start this off though with Cotton Weary (Live Schreiber) as he's stuck in traffic. We hear him talking to his agent and he gets a call on his cellphone. Since it is a woman's voice, he decides to talk to them. It turns out to be the voice from the changer and it changes to the familiar Ghostface voice, performed by Roger Jackson. It tells him that he can see his girlfriend in the shower. She is Christine (Kelly Rutherford) and she's attacked with the killer using Cotton's voice. When he finally arrives, she doesn't believe him and the two are attacked.From the events of the last film, we get to see what the people have been doing. Sidney Prescott is living in the middle of nowhere and livin in a somewhat of a fortress. She also works from home for a woman's crisis hotline under assumed name. We do see though that she's having nightmares that involve her mother, Maureen (Lynn McRee).Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) has made even more money off of the events in the last film, having written a book. She's on her tour when she's approached by Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey). He is a detective that is looking into what happened with Cotton and shows her a picture found at the scene. It is a younger picture of Maureen. Gale is asked for her help as she knows the case inside and out.This brings her to the set of Stab 3. The studio executive behind it is John Milton (Lance Henriksen). The director is Roman Bridger (Scott Foley). Portraying the characters from the original Scream film are Deon Richmond, Matt Keeslar, Jenny McCarthy, Emily Mortimer and Parker Posey. While on set, Gale comes face to face with Dewey Riley (David Arquette).When deaths start to happen with the cast members, Gale, Dewey and the surviving actors have to get to the bottom of this before it is too late. Dewey knows where Sidney is living, but refuses to give that information out. It takes an even darker turn when she gets a call from the killer. Who is doing this and what does the history of Maureen have to do with it?Now to start this actual review off, I'll admit that when I first saw the original Scream, I was blown away by it. To this day, I'm still a big fan and I even like the sequels, including this one. It wasn't until I was sitting down to write this that I realized. I've only seen this the one time in the theater. It was probably close to 20 years since the last viewing, but I knew a lot of the plot points still. I do have to admit, I liked it when I first saw it, but the longer I sat on it, the lower my thoughts were on it though.To get into this, I did have some issues with how in the face this film is. The first one and even the second one wasn't as blatant in the social commentary. I think that having this actually be on the movie set as they're making the third installment is part of the reason. I understand that as films keep going on, they have to get more and more outrageous. The problem here is that Scream was supposed to be smarter. This one just seemed to be dumb downed though and a bit too in your face.Something this film points out is that history we all thought true will be proven to be not be. I do like that this one actually deepens the back-story of the original one by adding another element to it. It doesn't really violate continuity though, which is something that I'm good with it. This also does give an interesting look at old Hollywood, which is actually quite fitting for what came out a couple years about with the Me Too movement. Ironically, this film is produced by the Weinsteins as well.The final aspect of the story I want to cover I've kind of already touched on, which goes to the rules of a trilogy. We get a video done by Randy (Jamie Kennedy) as he explains the rules of a trilogy. What I do know is that each film has to increase the body count and have more brutal kills. I do think we get a bit of that here. I don't necessarily agree with the rules, but it does lay out pretty much the whole story of the film as it tries to be smart. I'm kind of torn on this, but I had to bring it up.That will take me to the pacing of the film, which I thought was fine. We get the first action pretty early on and much like the other films in the series, we hit a bit of a lull as we get up to see with the story here. I think that there are some pretty creepy scenes before we get a kill. There is really solid climax that takes place at Milton's home though. It piles up the body count there. I also think that it is edited fine in a way where we are seeing a couple different stories as they converge into the conclusion. This runs at just under 2 hours and I really don't mind that. The ending is fitting for what they were building toward as well.As for the acting of this one, I have to say I was disappointed. I think there was quite a bit of overacting actually. Campbell I didn't have any issues with. I like that they establish her as a broken character that is isolating herself and not really living. When she sees things on the news, she knows she has to finish what she already thought she did. We don't get as much growth as from previous films, but she is fine. Cox and Arquette I wasn't really a fan of here. They both really just oversell their performances and it didn't work like the previous two. Dempsey was alright, but not really the biggest fan. I did like the cameos by Schreiber, Foley, Roger Corman, Henriksen, Mortimer and Posey, even though the last one really overacted as well. The rest of the cast I thought was decent, but no one stood out.This will take me to the effects of the film, which for the most part were solid. I thought this one went a bit bloodier which is good. I think that it is interesting that part of this film takes place on a movie set and there are actors playing actors. That allows some swerves with special effects. They do go practical so that is something that works for me. Outside of some markings on characters, I would just be nitpicking. Some of the deaths are a bit outrageous, but I come to expect that from a sequel.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack, which didn't really stand out to me if I'm honest. I noticed they used the 'Red Right Hand' song a couple of times, but it really didn't garner any nostalgia. I don't necessarily think it fit where it was placed in the movie. They also incorporate some lines from Maureen that Sidney can hear. I thought it was a bit overplayed, but there is a scene that did legit creep me out. The others were really to give this a wrapped up feel, which I'm okay with. I'd say overall this was hit or miss for me.Now with that said, my thoughts on this definitely came down after the initial viewing. After this one, I can definitely see some flaws. I think what makes the original film and its sequel special is really overblown in this one. There are some good ideas here, but I just don't know if it necessarily worked. I like the deepening of the back-story that built in the original, so I have to give credit there. I think the pacing and building of tension is good. There's a lot of overacting in this film that bothered me, which with the case was pretty surprising. The effects were good while the soundtrack was pretty hit or miss as well. This is interesting for the first watch when you don't know what is happening, but doesn't add a lot with a second viewing. It really goes a bit too far with the meta aspect for my liking. Overall I'd say this one is slightly above average.",Scream 3
68,raulfaust,Rolling my eyes outta my head,5,2 February 2011,"First I'd like to say that I don't appreciate movies starring ""FRIENDS"" actors, but Courtney Cox is an exception, since she's able to do different characters pretty well. Scream 3 is exactly what it is expected to be. Just another part of the trilogy that started fine but the thirst for money crashed it. This film is entertaining and intriguing, just like the other two. But the development is boring and I really get nervous for the writers never allowing the spectator to find out who is the killer. Why don't they put many clues in the plot and one of those clues really bring to the killer? Instead of this, here they put lots of clues but none of them is leading to the mystery's resolution. Scream 3 had another problem: too many names/characters, so we get to confuse who is who.Also, why on Earth Roman kill a thousand people just because he's jealous of his little sister?

70,Sandcooler,Sequels suck,2,11 March 2009,"By the time they got to making the third one, there was really no charm left in watching Neve Campbell overpowering the killer every time but screaming anyway. Sidney is just really irritating here. The writing is about as lazy as can get, with the revealing of who's killing everybody as an absolute low. I can't believe somebody actually got payed to come up with something as lame as that. Even by slasher standards this thing is just really lacking in creativity. If there's any fun in seeing nameless secondary characters being stabbed I haven't detected it. How I long for Rose McGowan and her garage door. You'd think Wes Craven would put in some decent horror value, but you'd think wrong. This seems like an assignment for him, I've seen beer commercials with more identity. I suppose the sound of the box office is hard to resist, but they really should have put in more effort for this.",Scream 3
71,brando647,Final Act Devoid of any Real Screams....,6,25 March 2009,"The final act in Wes Craven's thriller trilogy falls flat. The original remains one of my favorite scary movies, as it blended scares with humor in a perfect blend. The second film followed pretty closely in it's footsteps and, while it didn't improve on the formula, it didn't fail to do it's job. The third is barely suspenseful and seemed to focus more cracking jokes than slitting throats. In this final installment, a film production for STAB 3 hits a snag when cast members are being killed off in the order they die in the script.As I'd stated, the film neglects it's horror element in this run. The kills are no where near as brutal as we've seen previously and they rarely frighten. Most of the scares in the movie are just BOO moments, which run out of steam after a while. I think something else about the first two films was that the victims were people the audience could relate to: teenagers and college students. The horror occurred in a small town that could've been any small town in America. Now, the events take place in Hollywood and the victims are a bunch of unsympathetic, whiny actors. I personally found that I couldn't care less about whether any of them survived. As for the major moment when the killer is revealed? I can't begin to describe how anti-climactic it truly is; the filmmakers tried to tie the killer to the very beginning of the series but I don't feel it worked.The film reunites the three major players of the franchise. Neve Campbell is Sidney Prescott, who has gone into hiding as a crisis hotline attendant when she becomes haunted by visions of her murdered mother. Campbell's character, for once, is not the center of attention in this installment, seeing as how her character really doesn't have much screen time. David Arquette and Courtney Cox-Arquette return as Dewey Riley and Gale Weathers who team with Detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) to solve the string of (not) grisly murders. One a positive note, Jamie Kennedy has a cameo to reprise his role of Randy Meeks, the horror movie geek who arrives via video-tape to give the rules of a horror trilogy. Aside from some amusing performances from Patrick Warburton and Parker Posey, the remaining cast does little to stand out.While this is easiest the least frightening of the series, it isn't a terrible movie. A good portion of the humor works and the cast does enough of a job to keep the movie somewhat entertaining. I wish the filmmakers had remembered the name of the movie to be SCREAM and lived up to it's origins, but it could've been worse. It's worth watching if for no other reason than to see it all out until the end.",Scream 3

73,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Scream 3""- A confused and messy, yet occasionally satisfying misfire. Rounds out the story nicely, but falls prey to the clichés prior entries had satirized...",5,23 May 2016,"To call ""Scream 3"" a bit of a mess would be an understatement. A big, bad... frankly pretty severe understatement. It's messy. It's tonally confused. It's far too silly to take seriously in the the moments where it's supposed to be serious. It's sometimes too serious to be silly in the moments where it's supposed to be silly. And all too often it falls prey to the exact same tropes and clichés that the two excellent previous films had gone out of their way to cleverly subvert and satirize. In essence, ""Scream 3"" is the sort-of film that ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" poked fun at.Yet, I can't hate it. I won't. Because for all it's bizarre miss- steps and eye-rolling moments, it does fundamentally round out the story the behind the series in a very cool way, and it even develops the characters and plot line through a few... well, very fascinating (if not slightly convoluted) twists and turns. And at the end of the day, it's a fun, breezy watch thanks to these new directions and the wonderful chemistry of the returning cast.Just don't go in expecting another wonderful round of nuanced and clever meta-humor mixed with visceral thrills thanks to a great script. Because sadly, this is the one entry in the series not written by series creator Kevin Williamson, and it shows.When a string of mysterious murders begin to bump-off cast members and others associated with the production of the third ""Stab"" film (which were loosely based on the events of the original ""Scream"" movie), original survivors Sidney Prescott, Dewey Riley and Gale Weathers are forced to travel to Hollywood and try to solve the mystery of what is going on. And when it becomes all-too-clear that this new string of events is part of a plan for the killer to get their hands on Sidney, revelations about her own past will come to light... revelations that could not only change her life, but lead to its end.To get it out of the way, for the most part the cast is at the top of their game. Neve Campbell is the beating heart of this film (even if her screen time is slightly limited in comparison to the first two), and I think it could be argued that the one thing the film does 100% perfectly is its handling of the Sidney character and how the film puts her through some excellent development. David Arquette is as fun, silly and likable as ever. And new cast members like Patrick Dempsey and Parker Posey are a lot of fun.The only sore thumb really is Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers, who falls a little flat. And believe me, it's not Cox's fault. The fact is, her character is very mishandled in the story, and she comes off as far too... whiny and bratty for her own good, constantly needing to be ""saved"" by other characters. It just didn't quite work in this film. Though as I said, it's not the fault of Cox.It's the fault of the messy, hit-or-miss script.Story goes that series creator Kevin Williamson wasn't able to commit to this film due to scheduling conflicts, and he was replaced by writer Ehren Kruger. Kruger, while doing some good work on his own, just wasn't a good fit for the material. He didn't quite seem to be able to properly balance the satirical, humorous elements with the serious and horrifying. Though he tried his hardest undoubtedly, the result is a bizarre mish-mash of concepts and ideas that are generally far too broad and disconnected to really ""gel"" together into a cohesive experience. And as a result, he has to go back to the old some tropes. Cliché after cliché to try and fit the story together and deliver the jokes and scares. In essence, relying on the very same things that the last two movies joked about. So, it's just... awkward and messy when it tries to strike that fine balance needed for this sort of film.Thankfully, his effort at least paid off for the Sidney character, and for the interesting story beats the film takes in its second half. It's just a shame you have to slog through so much awkwardly- placed and out-of-left-field attempts at emulating Williamson's expect meta- humor and clichéd cat-and-mouse killer scenes to get to these interesting beats.Thankfully, director Wes Craven is still at the top of his game, and he's able to elevate the weaker script and play up the facets of it that do work thanks to his wonderful and sometimes poetic visual storytelling.As it stands, ""Scream 3"" is a mess. But an occasionally satisfying mess due to the things it does well. It suffers some weak writing and for inadvertently falling back onto the same clichés that previous films joked around with, but has just enough ""oomph"" in its second half to be worth seeing once for series fans.It's a middle-of-the-road 5 out of 10 for me. Not so much a ""Scream"" as an exasperated gasp.",Scream 3
74,fntstcplnt,Scream 3 (2000),5,23 March 2020,"Directed by Wes Craven. Starring Courteney Cox-Arquette, David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey, Scott Foley, Emily Mortimer, Deon Richmond, Josh Pais, Matt Keeslar, Lance Henriksen, Jenny McCarthy, Patrick Warburton, Liev Schreiber, (voice) Roger L. Jackson. (R)On the set of the sequel-within-the-sequel based on the killings from earlier ""Scream"" pictures, someone is icing the cast in the order in which they die in the script; what are the chances that the survivors of those earlier movies will show up and try to figure out who the killer is? Inspiration is running thin at this point (didn't Craven already do a similar premise with Freddy Krueger in ""New Nightmare""?), and the filmmakers seem aware of this by leaning further into the irony, wisecracking and meta-humor side of things, which is just as well since the stalking/stabbing scenes are tepid and repetitive, and the mystery is a complete wash (really, anyone could have been revealed as the culprit and it would have made just as much sense with a few revisions to the illogical motive). As in prior ""Scream"" movies, a list of ""rules"" are laid out, this time in regards to the final chapter of a trilogy--too bad none of them actually end up applying to this film! Posey is a hoot as the actress playing Cox-Arquette's reporter character; unfortunately, she's the only one who really stands out in the cast, but at least medical science advocates can feel satisfaction watching McCarthy get skewered. Cameos include Jamie Kennedy, Roger Corman, and a few amusing surprises.52/100",Scream 3
75,m-47826,The story come full circle.,5,12 August 2020,"Only the execution is lazy. What made the first, and maybe second movie so good, is handled so poorly in this one. Very few scenes stand out. The infamous opening sequence is awkward. Not only does it takes place in an appartement complex, where you can scream your lungs out without anyone calling the police. But it seems to be straight out of an action, rather than a horror, let alone slasher flick. The acting is sub-par, on all parts. And some of the lines are painful to hear. You even have that unpleasant cheap blockbuster feel throughout the movie. You can see it's not Kevin Williamson script anymore, just one from someone who's used to write big and soulless Hollywood movies. It is so unsubstantial you'd think it's the actual Stab sequel they are supposed to be shooting during the film. The death scenes aren't very tense either, very formulaic even, as if producers wanted this movie to be the first PG13 sequel of the franchise. It don't live up to any expectations, and is handled without the movie buff passion most fans love so much. On the bright side, the killer reveal has the whole trilogy plot come full circle, and the last shot gives the heroine a well deserved closure. And the audience a sense of one as well. For now, at least...",Scream 3
76,rivertam26,Not as good but ends everything nicely,8,11 May 2020,"It's hard when the two previous films in your franchise were literally horror masterpieces but than on top of it all to wrap up a trilogy is unthinkable. There was no way this wasn't going to be a tad disappointing. That being said this is a very fun movie and truly does a wonderful job of ending Sidney's story. This time around Sidney is living in seclusion and the murders start up again in Hollywood while they're making Stab 3 the first fictional sequel in the film within a film franchise. So both the original characters and the actors starring in the new film are targeted. What's great. Our core people are back and they are in top form. I love Neve Campbell's performance in this one because she is just done with it. Courtney Cox and David Arquette have wonderful chemistry as usual. As for the newbies Jenny McCarthy is fun, genre favorite Lance Henriken is awesome, Scott Foley is great and Carrie Fisher has one of the best cameos ever. But the real scene stealer is the amazing Parker Posey and when she's teamed up with Cox its incredible. Also the movies twist is one that wraps up the trilogy nicely. Now for the good. Its evident that Kevin Williamson didn't write the screenplay, he only wrote the treatment. It's not a bad screenplay it's actually good but focuses more on the comedy and feels different than the other films. All in all it's still a very hood film and just overly entertaining.Budget: $40m

77,Screen_Blitz,Downfall to Wes Craven's beloved slash series,3,20 October 2015,"Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson return for the third installment of the slasher horror that pleased critics and horror fans all around the country in the 90s, only this time, lot less fun or exciting than the previous two. Neve Campbell returns as Sidney Prescott who now works as a crisis counselor and is living isolated deep in the woodsy area of California, traumatized by the violent Woodsboro murders from the first two movies. Back in her hometown, Hollywood director Roman Bridger (played by Scott Foley) is working on slasher horror titled 'Stab 3' based on the Woodsboro murders. The production quickly goes awry when Ghostface makes his return and begins murdering the cast one-by-one. Sidney teams up with Gale (played by Courtney Cox) and Dewey Riley (played by David Arquette) to stop Ghostface's murderous onslaught once and for all.As this is the third installment of the series, there is lots of discussion about movie trilogies, and basically what the characters claim is that the third installment in a film series is about going back to the past and learning a shocking truth of what happened in the first film. We are also introduced to a set of new characters, most of which are very one-dimensional other than Parker Posey and Scott Foley's character. Compared to the previous two films, this one marks a low point for the series. The plot is much less clever and less original, and is completely devoid of scares or good humor. While the plot centers on the characters trying to solve the murders of the cast of the (fictional)movie 'Stab 3', the film throws a huge, needless sub plot of detectives trying to solve of Sidney's mother who was murdered which is made the plot so uneven. To make matters worse, Sidney has reduced screen time and appears in no more than half of the scenes, while the film focuses on Gale, Dewey, and these other new characters. The only thing redeeming about this film is the big twist at the end. Other than that, this film lacks the spirit and scares of the previous movies.Scream 3 is definitely my least favorite of the series and one of the most disappointing third installments I have seen. Unless you are a huge fan of the series, this one is probably worth staying away from.",Scream 3
78,Sirus_the_Virus,The curse of the trilogy.,7,8 September 2009,"I have enjoyed every Scream film and can't wait until Scream 4 is out. But like most third parts, Scream 3 is the weakest. Scream 3 has what I liked about the other Scream films. It was funny,scary, original, and fun. But Scream 3 had something about it, a problem that I think I can name but am unsure. Scream 3 was the weakest in the series because it got sort of silly. Why didn't they move their asses out of that place. I mean they did but I would go to somewhere like Indiana, where I live, and start a new life. Also, some scenes in the film were kind of silly. Like when the killer throws the knife at Dewy(David Arquette) and the end of it hits him in the face. It's just a little stupid. I still think that Scream 3 was a fun film though. I have always liked Gale(Courtney Cox) and Dewey because they are funny. Gale is my favorite in the series. Her and Dewey have some really funny lines. There were a few good performances too. One from Patrick Warburton from Seinfeld. The rest were really from David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Neve Campbell. I liked Scream 3, it has most of the key ingredients to a Scream film, but something in it is missing. It was also a little silly. I give it a thumbs up, but it's the weakest in the trilogy. I can't wait until Scream 4 comes out.Scream 3: ***/****",Scream 3
79,baumer,"Kevin, where are you?",4,9 February 2000,"Warning:  may be spoilersWhen Scream exploded onto the scene, horror movie buffs rejoiced.  Here was a film that rejuvenated the genre.  It was directed by horror master Wes Craven and it was written by a guy that obviously grew up liking the same films that we did as youngsters.  Kevin Williamson wrote a brilliant screenplay that showed us how much he loved horror films, and not just by writing a scary film but by including all of the horror insider stuff that only true horror fans would know about. He threw in a line right from Halloween at the beginning of Scream.  He gave one of his characters the same last name as the doctor in Halloween and a character in Psycho.  He knew of the non harmonious split between Craven and Robert Shaye after the original Nightmare On Elm Street was turned into a comedy for its sequels.  He was smart enough to trick his audience into falling for the question that asks who is the killer in Friday the 13th.  We all think it is Jason but of course he doesn't come around until the sequel, in the first one it was Mrs. Voorhees.  He had Fred Krueger references in the film, he had brilliant and witty dialogue about the horror movie rules for survival and he even had subtle moments of genius when he wrote lines like "" you're starting to sound like a Wes Carpenter film.""  and "" what's the werewolf movie with E.T.'s mom in it? ""  Kevin Williamson cares about Scream and he cares about horror films.  That is evident in the awesome Scream and even the quite good Scream 2.  But Scream 3 is terrible.  I won't go so far as to say it is an abomination but it is pretty bad.  It alienates its core audience, maybe not the teens that love it for all that it is but the audience of 20 and 30 somethings that know the roots of Scream.  This is not really a true sequel to Scream, it is nothing but a cheap standard horror film that a 90's audience has gotten used to.  There were no real scares, there was no great movie references to it that we could all feel proud that we understood and there was no great ending to sum it up. Straight up, this film is quite a disappointment, and that is too bad considering who is involved and who they got to take over for Kevin.Ehren Krueger penned this copy of Scream and when I learned that this guy was doing it I was excited.  He wrote one of the best films to come out of 1999 with Arlington Road.  It was smart and frenzied so I had high hopes for his version of Scream 3.  But it was a letdown.  And it goes to show you that no matter how good a writer you are, it is not necessarily easy to take over in a series that already has a certain style of writing.  If this was the first in a series of films, it might not be that bad, but it is the final showing in the great and epic series that had a generation of people scared and another generation of horror geeks ( like myself ) excited that someone had written almost a tribute to us, the horror generation from the late 70's and early 80's.  Ehren Krueger, although he has a great horror last name, is just a cheap and blasphemous copy of the original writer.The film itself suffers from lack of logic.  The killer should have been someone that we know and by giving us a brand new character that somehow ties into to our familiar family of characters really jeapordizes the credibility of the film.  Maybe this is just me but I think a great way to sum up the film would have been to either bring Stu and/or Billy back somehow and/or to have maybe Duey be one of the killers as well.  That would have been good and it would have also explained Duey's behavior in the first one and why he never got killed in the films.  Now I know that is just my opinion but it needed more shock than what it had in the film.  It was a terribly unsatisfactory ending and with the film being just okay up until that point, it left me with a terrible taste in my mouth.  It's too bad really because this was such a good series.  They say this is the last one, well they said that about the Friday the 13th series in 1984.  But just a year later Paramount realized that they could still make money off the name and they made another and another and another and.... well you get the point.  I just don't think this is the last of them.  The very last shot left way too much to be interpreted.  I do think there will be a fourth. Maybe it will be better than this one is.  Then again, any film may be better than this was.It always seems that horror sequels, and maybe just sequels in general don't know when to quit.  Halloween, Friday the 13th, First Blood, Rocky and so on, they all suffer at one point or another from bad sequelitis.  Now you can add Scream to that unfortunate list.  5 out of 10",Scream 3

82,Victor Field,"O Kevin, where art thou?",3,6 January 2002,"""Scream"" lived up to its title, being a masterclass from director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson on how to deliver a horror-comedy that managed to poke fun at conventions of the genre while at the same time being truly tense and scary. Though I don't subscribe to the view that the second film is a member of the Sequels That Are Better Than The Original Society, it wasn't a disgrace either.Unfortunately, Kevin Williamson was only a producer this time around, leaving script duties for the third and hopefully final film in the considerably less capable hands of Ehren Kruger of ""Reindeer Games"" infamy - just as ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" was penned by someone without the initials KW. The result, though admittedly not stinking out the screen the way that wretched movie did, is a long fall from the previous two films... basically, we're talking worst second sequel since ""The Karate Kid Part III.""Killing off Cotton in the first ten minutes (who as essayed by Liev Schreiber was a highlight of ""Scream 2"") was a big mistake, and the majority of the movie's fright scenes are similarly messed up; writer Kruger and director Wes Craven fill the proceedings with self-knowledge and cameos in lieu of turning the screws tighter - the stalking and killing of Jenny McCarthy's Sarah pales in comparison to the demise of Rose McGowan's Tatum (in the first film) and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Cici (in the second) - and telling a strong story (something both previous films did manage) also seems to be beyond them. The chronic lack of wit and mounting implausibilities also get in the way (how does Sidney know about a hidden passageway in the director's house?), and in the end you feel Craven spent all his self-reverence points on ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare,"" a movie that was also up itself but managed to be entertaining as well. Thank goodness, however, for Parker Posey (a better Gale Weathers than Courteney Cox Arquette), Emily Mortimer, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Carrie Fisher, Lance Henriksen, Scott Foley, and Neve Campbell. The cast is better than this movie... but the ""Scream"" trilogy is still preferable to the likes of ""Friday the 13th."" (Not to mention ""Urban Legend."")",Scream 3
83,Stampsfightclub,"Not scary, but weirdly thats the point",7,8 November 2009,"On the set of Stab 3 the cast are targeted by a serial killer using the same disguise as with Sidney Prescott (Campbell) who is once again brought into the equation.In the third instalment of the most renowned serial killer series in the world we see Wes Craven once more use an exquisite horror slasher motive to get the adrenaline pumping and once more the stakes are higher as Neve Campbell is once more at the centre of attention for the masked villain.Opening with the annoying Cotton rushing through traffic to save his girlfriend and the motive is set as the killer reveals his desire to kill Sidney and once more the central character from the franchise is up against the odds.Sidney has developed throughout the screams to be a developed protagonist. The first film depicted her as a nervous wreck and thanks to her difficult life has progressed to be a profound figure in the series. This film encodes quite a bizarre usage of her mother coming back and is rather uncomfortable than scary.Courtney Cox's Gale is as mouthy and uncaring as ever and though this film encodes some more sentimental scripting on her part, the friends star adds that necessity bite to portray her as the stubborn cow the reporter should be.But thanks to many films having many horror ideas this is never about the acting and is all focused on what mayhem the killer can ensue. Thanks to a clever part revival of the best character in modern horror we see more rules demonstrated and acted out but critically this film isn't scary.When you watch a film you usually know what you're getting into. If you watch a Richard Curtis flick you'll know automatically its trashy love and if you pick up a Stanley Kubrick picture you're going to see something other worldly. And the connotations of scream you obviously aspect to be on the edge of your seat clutching desperately to the cushion. Whilst the first two films weren't especially groundbreaking in terms of scares they were certainly profound in demonstrating the motives and activities of a psycho, which this 2000 release does not accomplish.There are frequent appearances of the white face and predictable jumps. And the fact that he keeps falling over and bashing into things make him appear as a clown rather than an established murderer and so your scare factor is down basically to the situation.And yet that does work as once more the scripting is effective enough to keep you guessing right until the final stages and this is the franchise's strong point. With all 3 films you never know till the end and you simply have to keep viewing.The first scream was definitely the best and since then the screams have dwindled but ultimately the films keep you guessing and this is its purpose, to entertain, which it does.",Scream 3

86,stamper,"Well, what to say of this third ( and last?) episode of this slasher/thriller series (trilogy?)",7,26 June 2000,"This is the worst film in the trilogy, but is it bad????? NO, not at all. It is pretty good. Why? Well read!!The first thing I noted, while watching this film, is that there are some people obviously running out of ideas here, I mean you really can tell who is going to be killed and the way they are killed are alike the variations of the first two (with a FEW exceptions of course). The: Hello, is someone there??' routine gets old too. But I must admit, that there was some good stuff too. The new ways' of the killer were very cool. The story itself is pretty cool especially the ending, which unravels all of the previous mysteries'. This is very, very well done indeed. It was not only an ending that was plausible, but it was good instead, it actually only explained a bit of the trilogy's happenings, but that was enough, because the rest needed not be explained as is often done in cheap slasher/horror flicks. I also feel that the killer was a great choice with motives and all and that he, of all the supporting cast was the best. The part after the killings I found rather unnecessary, but it was still watchable. I do not mean the Neve Campbell stuff at the end I rather liked that. But mow further on the story, I found that there was too much spoofing going on here, especially with that Gale from Stab 3 (played very annoyingly by Parker Posey). Too Much spoof that wasn't funny and all in all little laughable scenes I must say compared to Scream or even Scream 2. The supporting cast was really worse than before, but that had to do with the film being set on the set of a cheap slasher flick. I mean not all were bad, they were all OK in a way, but that fake Gale really annoyed the hell out of me. I mean this film missed the likes of Tatum (Rose McGowan), Billie (Skeet Ulrich), Stuart (Matthew Lillard) who were all great in Scream and of course Randy (Jamie Kennedy) who was good in Scream and brilliant!!!! (excuse my exaggeration) in Scream 2. Also David and Courteney's on  screen chemistry, which was worse than OK in Scream 3 made the film less fun to watch. The only steadily good actor/actress was Neve Campbell and maybe David Arquette (if in this one he was only good if not joined by his wife, whereas in the others he was always fun to watch). THAT MUCH about bad things, what was good in the film? Well, I especially liked the scene where the house exploded (clever!), the cellar scene (with Courteney, David and Ghostface) plus I really liked the dream sequence in Sid's house. These were three really great scenes. The first one was really clever, the second one was quite funny and extraordinary I felt because I often wondered why that what happened to Dewey didn't happen more often in films. As a matter of fact it never did as far as I know. The third scene was probably the best, because it helped you feel the movie, it gave me a shiver and I love that. The music, the acting the camera the direction everything was perfect in that scene. Now for the actors. First of all I feel that the magic between Courteney Cox and David Arquette missed in this one, I don't know if it has to do with the both of them being married in real life or something like that, but I missed something here. It tasted like nuked leftovers. Also I must say that the supporting ladies are not quite as stunning as in the previous two, except maybe Jenny McCarthy, who looks like a total knock  out. Of course Courteney Cox does not look that nice, she is far too thin and what the hell is up with that hair. I remember when I saw the commercial, that I thought: Damn she looks ugly.', but I must admit that, while watching the film I hardly noticed. The killer was really good and you believed his twisted ways and you kind of understood him too. As for Campbell, I don't know, I like her almost always. It is not that she is the hottest babe in the world or that she plays Oscar worthy characters. She is just so natural and nice that you just have to like her. Also her character has evolved greatly in this trilogy, which makes her even better.Well and now for the director, well Wes did a good job most of the time and he did exceptionally well two times in the movie or maybe even three. But his directional influence could be seen in one scene in particular, and that is the dream sequence scene I talked about earlier. This scene is really a sign of how good a director Wes is, he uses the music, the plot and the actors to create a scene that influences the audience. He makes you feel something during the movie and that is a great thing to accomplish and in a horror movie it is even better.After seeing this one, I want to say to everyone who participated in the three movies: great job, thank you, but do not make another one, unless you can come up with a whole lot of other ideas (as for ways of killing, ways of the killer's approach (like it was done here!!!!)) and maybe a little bit different approach (as to the Is somebody there routine). Also keep the spoofing down and the laughs up, just as in Scream. All in all generally enjoyable, but I must change my grades for the other 2 films:
Scream:8,0 (highly recommended)
Scream 2:	7,5 (recommended)
Scream 3:	               7,0 (pretty good)",Scream 3

I love this film to death I enjoy this film I have watch it with my dad. It is an underrated gem my personal favorite sequel in the ""Scream"" franchise series. It is an improvement over the second one. Sidney Prescott is a such a bad-ass, you have for the first time in the movie an explosion you see a house been blowed up. The plot and the story is set the first time in Hollywood. I love that it is an original story, it does not copy the second or the first film, it doesn't mess with the first two movies. It does finish the trilogy and brings an ending conclusion to the franchise. I enjoy this film, I love this film to death. Wes Craven did a great direction debut. Ehren Kruger replaced Kevin Williamson thank god and he did much better job to make an original story and make an conclusion to end the trilogy. I love with what happened next with the characters: Sidney now is a crisis counselor, I liked that. Ghostface returns he has unfinished business with Sidney and he wants her back. Dewey Riley is now working as an film adviser In Hollywood. I love his character, this time around David Arquette was better actor in this movie. I love that they did something new with his character, he wasn't annoying, he wasn't useless, he was good. He shot with a hand gun and killed the killer on the end, a real hero in this movie. Patrick Dempsey as detective Mark Kincaid was great he was likable and I have enjoyed him. I love his character. I love Jenny McCarthy as Sarah Darling she was believable. The movie was not dull, lame, or repainting the same story again, it had less humor, more horror, mystery and action it was mixed it had that what the second movie didn't had. The story is set three years after Scream 2 Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who has gone into self-imposed isolation following the events of the previous two films is drawn to Hollywood yet again she returns again to face the past and find out who is responsible for her mother's death. The new Ghostface begins killing the cast of the film within a film Stab 3 and has a score to stale with Sidney Prescott. Dewey Riley and Gale Waethers are trying to find out who is responsible for the killings. Gale has an unlikely sidekick Parker Posey as Jennifer Jolie. Courtney Cox is excellent as always as Gale Weathers. 10/10 I personally enjoy this sequel it is my favorite sequel in the franchise. Lance Henriksen is in this movie too and he is believable.

88,fernandoschiavi,"Scream 3 is the worst movie in the franchise. There are some funny moments, but the script presents many visible flaws",5,25 July 2021,"The first movie set the rules. The second subverted the scheme. In the third, as presented in the plot and disclosure, anything can happen. Wes Craven continues his saga based on the assertion that today's young people need to process their fears in a playful and fun way. In Scream 3, the formula looks a bit worn, as there is a feeling that everything has already been said in the air. Moving towards a finalization of the trilogy, the feature film directed by Craven and written by Ehren Kruger, who assumes the role of Kevin Williamson (who was busy scripting Wasteland at the time), completely changes the pattern built so far, making clear the signature of Kruger, who was on his first job at the time. The film appears as a renewal in the plot, but that little by little becomes doubtful, mainly because it escapes the curve that was created as a standard for the franchise, leaving even the observations left by Williamson imperceptible in the middle of the new creation.Scream 3 presents us with the following plot: there is a continuation of the hit The Stab rocking Hollywood. What should have been a financial bang falls apart when an assassin appears who starts killing those involved in the production based on the order in which they die in the script. We will know, therefore, that all this is a pretext to attract Sidney from her retreat, given that the girl now lives isolated and works as a volunteer helping people who are victims of social problems. The bait is bitten by the fact that, with each death, the killer leaves a photo of his mother, Maureen Prescott, at a time unknown to all.The first mistake in Scream 3 is in using this voice simulator device! When trying to innovate, they diminished what was best in the franchise: the sinister voice of Roger Jackson, the true Ghostface! And it is impressive how much this device manages to capture not only the tone of voice, but also the gestures and the language of each person imitated (irony detected). Also, as the actions take place in Hollywood, they found exaggerated ways to include Dewey (Arquette) - as film consultant - and Gale (weathers), who is a famous journalist always close to the story. However, none beats the participation of Randy (Jamie Kennedy), who died in Scream 2, making a cameo in a tape delivered by his sister to the studio, where he introduces the rules of survival to a trilogy. On the other hand, it was a good idea to use the backstage of a film from the Stab franchise as a backdrop, with the actions taking place inside a movie studio, with its producers, director and actors as characters in the story. In addition to working even more with metalanguage, it allows for some curious scenes such as the one that takes place in the scenario built to be Sidney's house, with the girl running through the environments in the same way she did in the first murder attack in the original film.Scream 3 can't get where the other two got to. It has a weak history compared to the first two, and Ehren Kruger doesn't seem to understand much about suspense. No death scene is very suspenseful, and death is pretty light, let's put it that way. He sticks the knife in the victim's back and that's it. A little disappointing for anyone who saw a Casey Cooper hanging with its guts hanging out of a tree, or a Cici Cooper getting stabbed several times in the back and being thrown from the second floor of her house. Aside from little suspense and violence, Scream 3 doesn't have the most creative story. It's basically about a serial killer who starts killing the cast of the movie Stab 3 (Stab 3) and will obviously also be looking for the helpless Sidney.There are interesting details in the script, such as the necklace that Sidney's boyfriend-victim in the previous film gave her and which she wears as a kind of souvenir, as well as the grandiose chase scene in the studios of The Stab 3, complete with a Woodsboro replica and tension moments typical of the franchise. What gets in the way is the presence of easy scares thanks to the ingenious sound work and the application that serves as a replicator of the voices of the other characters. As an example, the fence of the house where Sidney is isolated. Is not even more than a meter, in short, protects who or what?One of the most problematic elements of the plot, which sounds like a real rabbit out of a hat (in English the term jump the shark would be used here, meaning a non-sense and desperate twist), is the revelation of the killer and his true identity. His motivation, however, is the film's true jump the shark moment. Strange plot twists like the one involving the murderer and Sidney are worthy of the most exaggerated Mexican soap operas, because we know the protagonist well from other films to know that nothing indicated this. When applied to a supporting character it becomes more likely. Revelations like this are usually accompanied by ""I was around watching it all this time"", or in the case of villains, ""I was behind everything"", without leaving any trace of its existence until then. It always sounds synonymous with lazy script.Another item that has bothered fans of the franchise since the release of the third movie is the second killer theory. Officially, Scream 3 is the only movie in the series that doesn't have two killers behind the crimes, but only one. What is notable throughout the entire projection is the super strange behavior of one of the characters: Angelina (Emily Mortimer), the actress who plays Sidney in Stab 3. In the scene where the mansion explodes killing one of the actors, Angelina appears suspiciously, to which some characters, such as Dewey (David Arquette), question her, look at her in an incriminating way and the soundtrack helps us to distrust the girl. In another tense moment, Sidney catches her ready to wear Ghostface's outfit and attack her, but she immediately invents a lame excuse. These clues left throughout the film serve to confuse the audience, showing obviousness about the guilt of a character, to divert our attention making us believe that it cannot be him (a). Thus, finally revealing his authorship or complicity in the crimes. Something like it was done in the first Scream with Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), the most obvious character, who ended up actually proving the culprit - but he wasn't alone.Angelina's ""death"" is also suspect, and takes place almost off-screen, half-at-a-glance, seen from above by another character, with every indication of being falsely orchestrated. In one of the scenes in the mansion, we can see Ghostface attacking Tyson (Deon Richmond) and, seconds later, inside a secret passage, chasing and killing Jennifer (Parker Posey - who steals the scene as the actress who plays Gale Weathers).This is another moment that makes clear the existence of two people using the assassin's costume. These suspicions are not by chance. Director Wes Craven himself confirmed in comments that originally Angelina was one of the movie's assassins and Roman's secret girlfriend. She was also a former schoolmate from Sydney, obsessed with the protagonist's tragic story (an idea repurposed in the fourth film). The fight and the outcome with the death of the villains was very similar to the second film, causing the producers to disapprove, dismissing the idea. The problem is that the film had already been shot with this proposal, and the change left several scenes loose in the air, which only emphasize Angelina's bizarre behavior, without a plausible explanation for this. Another problem is the ending that lasts too long. There's a lot of talk at the expense of action. Following the police style, with the usual atmosphere of ""who is the murderer?"", Scream 3 relates, again, to Halloween, now referring to the idea, even if very fleeting, of ""brother killer"".With regard to sociological aspects, the film continues its satire on the clichés of the genre, using them to execute the plot. An interesting issue is to note that, unlike the 1980s, when movie monsters punished the American yuppie generation for their excessive acts (sex, drugs, among others), in the 1990s the killer belongs to the same clan. There is social leveling and the reasons are psychological, almost absurd, as life sometimes is. We are not dealing with handicapped children who drowned, or the distraught caretaker who was burned to death for abusing little children. The ""monsters"" of the time are rich, beautiful and, based on what society dictates, presentable.Another hit are their special appearances, which come to insert even more the comedy in the long, as Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, who appear as their famous characters Jay and Silent Bob on a tour of Sunrise Studios, the same tour where we can see a quick appearance by Wes Craven. Another of the great appearances is Carrie Fisher who plays Bianca Burnette, a former actress who auditioned to play Princess Leia in Star Wars but ended up losing the role to an actress who slept with George Lucas. Perhaps the biggest problem with the feature film is its premise, which was completely lost in this third feature.Once again we see Marco Beltrami's track stand out and cause most of the scares, although less often than in previous ones. The mansion setting where the final events take place was very well designed and gives us a greater sense of threat and even claustrophobia in its smaller environments, this was really something that worked well in the film. Scream 3 is actually the weakest movie in the franchise. There are some funny moments, mostly starring Jennifer (Parker Posey), the one who plays Gale in Stab, but in the end, they end up not producing the necessary effect, although it is fun.",Scream 3

90,TheNorthernMonkee,"suitable finish, but at times incredibly bland",5,9 August 2005,"SPOILERS All too often Horror sequels become consistent and regular and before long it's entirely possible to end up with a ten film series which was tired after one. It'd be nice to believe therefore that in 2000, Wes Craven and writer Ehren Kruger (taking over from creator Kevin Williamson) were genuine when they released 'Scream 3' as the final part of a trilogy. A suitable conclusion to the series, the film was often increasingly bland whilst once more proving the intelligence of the series with some suitable mockery of Hollywood and it's principles. It was entertaining without being gory, and it's final conclusion felt like a clever piece of psychological drama.On the set of 'Stab 3' the cast are being killed off. Just like in the real world that the film is based upon, a man stalks the crew with an artistic white mask and a large blade. Looking for the hidden Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the killer works his way through people before your typical horror conclusion.Once more attempting to demonstrate their intelligence, Craven and associates use 'Scream 3' as a way of making a point about trilogies. Roping in a video of deceased film fan Randy (Jamie Kennedy) to explain the principles, we have the basic rules of the third film explained to us like we are a two year old child. This in itself would be tolerable, but the problem we have is that new writer Kruger is just not in the same league as the series' original creator. Missing out on large amounts of humour, so much of the film is simplistic and predictable but without the witty script too.It's as if the point is being made that eventually series are just tired and drawn out. The characters are old, the killing is getting boring and the zest with which the original film thrived has long since departed. 'Scream 3' does have it's moments, and the conclusion is a nice way of rounding off the series, but ultimately it just isn't as good as the first two films.Every story should be resolved. That appears to be the basic gist of 'Scream 3'. In this final part of the trilogy, the cast return, we have a new killer, and great truths about the previous films are laid out on the table. 'Scream 3' needed to be made to really finish off the story. It's a shame therefore that it is such a badly written film. Awkward and often incredibly bland, it never lives up to the style of the first two films. It is worth watching just to get some closure on the series, but as a film in it's own right, it's not the finest you'll see.",Scream 3
91,swilliky,Bring the slasher franchise to a trilogy,4,15 August 2016,"The crew returns to make this horror franchise a trilogy. This time, the killer is stalking Hollywood and the stars of a meta movie Stab 3 based on events of Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and company. Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) and Dewey Riley (David Arquette) also return as wealthy consultants for the films and amateur detectives. The killer starts with Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) and works their way through the actors in the new film in the order that they die in the script.The movie expounds on trilogies and skewers the shallowness of film stars. Randy (Jamie Kennedy) is revived in a video to explain the rules for the third part and this means that things from the past will come back to haunt the main characters. The plot does come around and connect with the other films though the final explanation comes off as a little flimsy. Wes Craven embraces the campiness of this slasher flick a bit more than the first two.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Scream 3

It lures Sidney out from hiding in the woods, giving her no choice but to go to Hollywood and face Ghostface once and for all.Third entries have been hit and miss. You get some good ones like Return of the Jedi, Back to the Future Part III, A Nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Warriors, and How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, but unfortunately, you get others that are either disappointing or downright terrible like Shrek the Third and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Scream 3, while not godawful, is also another disappointing third entry of a successful franchise that started with the original.There are some good things to talk about. It's nice to see Ghostface again and is as iconic as ever, the production design's well-shot, the music score from Marco Beltrami is well composed as it fits the haunting thrilling atmosphere, and the performances are very good with Neve Campbell still likeable and relatable as Sidney Prescott along with Courtney Cox and David Arquette continuing to shine as Gale Weathers and Dewey while guest stars, including Patrick Warburton, do some decent support. Not to mention that the story does have an interesting satire on movie trilogies.That being said, the film's not without it's problems. The story, despite it's interesting satire, is just a basic retread of the original Scream. Now, many people can argue that Scream 2 also retreaded the original film, but at the very least it introduced new elements including as introducing Billy's mother. For this film, it didn't have any new elements aside from it's satirical take on movie trilogies. Furthermore, the pacing came across as rather pedestrian and the ending wasn't as thought-out. Not to mention that it's lack of scares kind of hurt the film for me.Overall, Scream 3 is just an okay third entry. It does have good acting, great music, and a nice concept, but it doesn't feel as well-paced, it retreads the original film with nothing new aside from the concept, and it lacks the scare factor. This is only worth watching to those who liked the original film and Scream 2, though.",Scream 3

94,Jack the Ripper1888,Thank the lord that this is the end.,8,19 April 2002,"This movie was the worst of the entire series. It had no obvious plot and no storyline. Writer Ehren Kruger sucks. He cannot write a good script. Neve Campbell is the least used of all the film's central characters. Which is really bad, because she is listed as the film's leading star. *SPOILER* This movie is horrible. I thought it was okay, but it isn't even that if you sit down and really think about what is happening. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) now secludes herself up in her house away from the world, her only contact with other people being her job, which she does from home. *MAJOR SPOILERS* So, when this killer calls her on her home phone, we all wonder ""how did he do that?"". Even she wonders that. She even mentions that her phone number is unlisted and has changed her name to Laura. But this killer, didn't seem to find any of this to be a problem. Writer Ehren Kruger takes everything in this film and makes it somehow so that it was tied in with the first and second films. And that really makes a terrible movie. *MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS* When the killer turns out to be Sidney's brother, after Sidney has killed him in a very un-original fight to the death, they have a little moment where they both grab each other's hands and look into each other's eyes. That moment was stolen directly from HALLOWEEN: H20. Ehren Kruger can't even steal scenes from other movies right! Atleast in HALLOWEEN: H20, it looked real. Here, it just looks like something Sidney does to every psycho killer that she has just murdered out of self-defense. Pretty hokey stuff. So, the killer, goes through all this trouble to go on a killing rampage, trying to get Sidney out of hiding. Because he wants her dead. Why? Don't know. Why four years after the second film? Don't know. Again, another thing that Ehren Kruger didn't think about. He only wrote it because he thought it would be cool. Which it is not. The killer, for some reason, wants Sidney dead because their mother abandoned him at a younger age. One of the dumbest plots ever seen on film. There is even an explosion in the movie, which is clearly done just so something could blow up in the film. SCREAM 3: horrible. See it anyway, though. Its good if you're in the mood for a movie to upset you. 2/5.",Scream 3

The deaths are pretty horrific, with plenty of heart-racing chase scenes and gory, creative deaths. This film seems to have gathered a cult following, probably because most people did find this film to be horrific. However, when I saw the film, I just laughed at the antics and the character dramas unfolding. It is suspenseful, and it is gory, and most people did consider this frightening. However, if you do not like this type of film or are looking for something a little more than a cliché, then do not bother with this one.

But this one just sucked! Everything was cheesy.  It was more of a comedy, than a horror flick.  The ending wasn't shocking (and this ending was supposed to close the series). But worst of all, it wasn't made for horror buffs.  It's just one of those movies where anybody can just walk in the theater and watch (you wouldn't even have had to see `Scream' or `Scream 2').  `Scream' was for horrorbuffs. `Scream 2' was for both `Scream' fanatics, and horrorbuffs.  But `Scream 3' was just nothing.  It had no movie trivia, wasn't even funny, not original at all, and not even scary.  The only reason one should view this trash is to see how the great `Scream' and `Scream 2' end, or just want to see if it's as bad as I say.  Trust me, it is.  3/10.  I gave it a 3/10 because at least all the returning actors came back.  David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Liev Schreiber, and even a special appearance by JAMIE KENNEDY AS GEEKY RANDY MEEKS!  Which sucked, but at least Randy was in it!

Sidney (Campbell) is forced out of hiding, re-unites with Dewey (Arquette) and Gale (Cox) and must face yet another serial killer.OK Scream 3 may not be as strong as 1 and 2 but I still say that it's perfect end to a perfect trilogy. Sidney must the most unluckiest girl in the world every time she makes friends they die, lucky for her in this one she doesn't make any friends smart move for her. also love that they changed the setting, this time the film takes place in La La Land witch opens up a new door for this entrypoking fun at Hollywood and self absorbed actors. We still get to see ""Woodsboro"" the town the two other films took place in but this time it's in the guise of a movie set. They use that set well, giving us a breathtaking stalk scene with a few surprises. The film has a few things we didn't find in the previous entries. We get a kool ""car racing down a highway"" scene, a massive explosion and way more gun play. Directer Wes Craven has decided to use elements of Nightmare On Elm Street in this one such as Sidney's freaky dreams about the killer and her dead mother, This being the third in the series I will admit that it doesn't come close to having the edge, the wit or the suspense the first one had. We're use to the format this time around.: The opening murder was a bit of a disappointment it wasn't as gory or effective as one and two and way to predictable and the twist ending was a bit of a let down as if to say it's all been done before. But the film does bring the series full circle and also what we thought we knew about the past something comes back and bites Sidney on the ass. This movie again brings back Sidney, Dewey and Gale one last time and even a cameo of dead Randy giving yet again more horror movie survival tips from beyond the grave, well videotape. Again we also have a host of new characters such as Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) the policeman on the case of the recent murders going and is also a film buff, Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey) the eccentric actress playing Gale Weathers in Stab 3, Producer Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) angry that his movie gets shut down because of recent murders, Tyson Fox (Dean Richmond) playing a Randy type character in Stab 3 but deterimed to make the character his own, Angelina Tyler (Emily Mortimer) the new Sidney Prescott in Stab 3, directer John Milton (Lance Henriksen), Tom Prinze (Matt Kessler) Dewey in Stab and last but not least Sarah Darling b-movie actress plays an early victim in Stab 3.The Acting Firstly I was surprised to see Carrie Fisher in this movie even though it's just a 2 minute cameo but she rocks, Jenny McCarthy was very sexy charming and I liked her in her short time, Neve Campbell (Sidney), Courtney Cox (Gale) and David Arquette (Dewey) reprise their respective parts and nothing new is brought to them, Parker Posey I loved her comic and manic performance she was the real star of the movie Patrick Dempsey was great very handsome in his role he deserves bigger movie roles and more success because he's a great actor.All in all, well the killings were a bit of a let down much less graphic than the other two but Wes Craven does it again doing a brilliant end to an awesome trilogy.",Scream 3

101,Movie-12,"Not as effective as the original ""Scream,"" but still produces enough scares and thrills. *** out of ****",7,18 February 2000,"SCREAM 3 / (2000) ***Starring: Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette, Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey, Scott Foley, Lance Henriksen, Matthew Keeslar, Jenny McCarthy, Emily Mortimer, Deon Richmond, Patrick Warburton, Liev Schreiber, and Carrie Fisher Directed by Wes Craven. Written by Ehren Kruger, based on characters by Kevin Williamson. Running time: 116 minutes. Rated R (for strong horror violence and language).By Blake French:	""Scream 3"" is not as satisfying as the original horror masterpiece ""Scream,"" but what can we expect from the final chapter in a slasher trilogy? The first film was a superior horror thriller--one of the most loved slasher movies of the past decade. That was a picture with some hard standards to live up to. However, Wes Craven, director of the trio, accomplished another success with the sequel of ""Scream."" Usually this kind of movie would fade into the Hollywood recycle bin by now. But ""Scream 3"" still produces chills, thrills, and lots of surprises--even though we have been receiving the same kind of story for the past four years. This film is marginally passable, although the most flawed film of its series, that fairs as recommendable, but not substantial in quality. 	The film's opening once again provides the audience with a pre-credit murder sequence that is almost the highlight of the entire production. The ""Scream 3"" writers take advantage of one of the movie's old and important characters to arrange this very effective, and scary, sequence.
	The setting is several years after the second film. The small college town of Woodsboro is where we are placed. Neve Campbell again stars as Sidney Prescott, a tormented young woman who was the target of the killing sprees in the past. She has attempted to move on with her life with her father, and has an anonymous hotline operation that offers assistance to those in need. Also, television reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) has experienced a big career jump, now working for a network called Total Entertainment. While the wrongly accused murder suspect of Sidney's mother, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), has his own trashy TV talk show.
	The central presence that connects the events here is the production of ""Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro,"" a movie the characters are creating that follows a horror trilogy based on the terrors experienced by Sydney. The masked murderer may or may not be found on the set. Besides police Detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey), and the arrogant bodyguard Stone (Patrick Warburton), concluding the list of suspects, there is Dewey Riley (David Arquette), a former cop who is now an advisor for ""Stab 3,"" Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), the film's director, John Milton (Lance Henriksen) the film's producer, as well as acting counterparts Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy), Tom Prinze (Matthew Keeslar), Angelina (Emily Mortimer), Gabe Tucker (Deon Richmond), and Gales's reciprocal (Parker Posey).	Certain plot points lead our suspicion to believe one of several characters is the killer. We are fooled again, however. But does the killer's identity really matter here? As long as we receive a speech on why he or she is responsible, we would be satisfied and any of the character's could have been the killer. None of the characters have any shape or construction. We care only about the order that the victims will be picked off at, not about who hides behind the ghost mask. The identity is actually pointless when the slasher is finally revealed. 	Once again, a key success in ""Scream 3"" is the scary sequences that build up momentum and thus work well, usually where the slasher kills his victims. What makes these scenes so effective is how we know that characters are three dimensional; they put up a firm fight for their lives, unlike victims in most slasher films. However, the plot seems to revolve around the murders, instead of the murders branching off from the story. ""Stab 3"" seems to be a central presence to connect the film's somewhat desperate through line. 	Some of the plot points are fun and revealing. We see a videotape of a past character describing the possibilities of the movie's final outcome. This event programs our imaginations to suspect the unexpected. The plot does desperately attempt to fill in missing pieces of the previous screams, however, showing some signs of contrived foreshadowing. Each scene moves the story forward, though, replenishing the plot with freshness and ability around every abrupt corner. 	""Scream 3"" is a close call, and is given somewhat of a mixed review, but I still am giving the movie a marginal recommendation. It contains more startles, more surprises, and more effective scary material than most slasher movies.  Although I believe it was a wise move to make this film the final installment of its series.Brought to you by Dimension Films.",Scream 3
102,alice liddell,Creditable closure (possible spoiler),6,3 May 2000,"Wow, it looks like Craven meant it after all, SCREAM genuinely was a comedy. Not in the flip, 'ironic' sense, but in the traditional, ancient sense of the Greeks and Shakespeare.  All those references to theatre, performance, reality/illusion, actor/role, then, weren't just pretentious appendages, but a systematic attempt to create an old-style comedy, ending with the possibility of marriage and a casting out of demons, especially family ones. Such ambition is laudable.It helps that Craven has gone the whole hog and reduced SCREAM to its bare bones as game.  Much of the first film gained its charge as the emotionally grounded moral journey of a young woman in a very recognisable milieu.  The sequel took the plausible, subsidiary referentiality between clever young people as the film's raison d'etre to excess, but managed, amidst the hollowness, to find a romantic frisson between Dewey and Gale, culminating in the remarkable two-way mirror scene.  3's thrill is intellectual, and although once you've worked out the pattern and probable development (the cameo of Jay and Silent Bob, stars of that other STAR WARS homage, DOGMA, gives it away), you can guess the nature if not the detail of the ending, this doesn't stop the film being highly intriguing.One of the improvements on its predecessor is that it actually absorbs its sequel status into its form, rather than just joking about it.  And so it makes use of that most venerable of horror tropes, the doppelganger, but, as is typical of SCREAM's aggressive post-modernity, diffuses it, so that we've a whole host of doubles.  It is amusing and appropriate that the central 'original' trio don't die, and all the actors who play them in the film do.This can be a joke at all the poor post-SCREAM imitators, the nature of sequels in general, the idea of film being just a component in a whole nexus of merchandise and promotion.  It can also suggest the split within the characters themselves, a Lucas-like good and evil, but also being torn between solitude and friendship, ambition and domesticity, or just the sense of living in a world where you are alienated from yourself, a lovely old-fashioned 60s arthouse idea popping up in the strangest of places.3, as it interrogates the past, its own past (prequels), and that of the characters, also becomes a rumination on the medium, and there is a lot of lovely stuff about old Hollywood and its ghosts, the forgotten spooks haunting the glittering party, hints of the depravity and evil lurking under the surface.  The film is also funnily daring in implying that little has changed, especially when you consider the awesome acting talent on display.This sense of Hollywood's haunted past is appropriately figured in a glorious, Cormanesque Gothic mansion, where the labyrinthine twists and turns shadow the not very straight progress of Hollywood history.  The seriously underrated Lance Henriksen is superb as John Milton, the moral monster with the pained, sensitive face.  Milton, of course, was the poet who wrote Paradise Lost, the archetypal study of unloveable good and charismatic evil, and in a sense, Milton here is the author of the SCREAM trilogy, his creation being the motor of the horrors.It is as a critique of the family that the trilogy works best.  There is a conservative impulse here - in demonising a promiscuous mother, in ending the film in marriage - but it rejects the notion of family being a given as a force of good.  Rather it is a force of terror, death, evil, sterility, fragmentation, uncertainty, preventing its young from any growth into maturity.  Sidney spends the first half of the film withdrawn from the world, alone, in fear - this is the result of family life.  She is only safe when she is with her adopted family - a firm blow for moral choice.  Of course, this is slightly self-serving - the case against violent films being the corruption of family - but why not?3 is full of fresh air after its predecessor.  The change of screenwriter has breathed new life into the series, allowing Craven to minimise tiresome jokes in favour of something more mythic, even if it's just a parody of myth.  The only sustained self-referentiality, featuring the dead Randy, is actually quite moving.  Best of all is the increasing minimalising of Sidney throughout the series.  Her static solipsism is rejected in favour of the joys of group dynamics, often very funny here.  The scene in the Woodboro set where Sidney is chased is supremely chilling and affecting.",Scream 3
103,FlickJunkie-2,"Still entertaining, but running low on fuel",7,5 August 2000,"Wes Craven has produced another entertaining, high budget horror movie in the third of what is now a trilogy.  The film professes an end to the sequels, but at $100 million average box office per movie, frankly I'm skeptical.  The first three `Friday the 13th' movies didn't gross $100 million between them, and now twenty years later, they are producing number ten.This film didn't traverse any new ground, continuing from `Scream 2' with the movie within a movie concept.  Though Craven still presents a droll and effective story, he has stopped innovating.  He simply continues to present us with good but jaded themes.It seems the gore has been toned down for this film, which is probably not a bad thing.  The story answered all sorts of questions about the first film that no one had.  I suppose they needed to create questions so they could make a movie to answer them.  I didn't find Ehren Kruger's writing to be up to the standard set by Kevin Williamson.  Williamson's humor was much more sophisticated and astute whereas Kruger settled for low brow sarcastic sniping and tongue in cheek humor.The whole cast delivered a collectively enjoyable performance, although with the paranoid and overwrought way that Sidney was written, Neve Campbell couldn't have had much fun.  Courtney Cox was funny and flaky as ever as Gale Weathers as was hubby David Arquette.  The rest of the ensemble including Patrick Dempsey, Emily Mortimer, Liev Schreiber, Scott Foley, and Parker Posey and a host of other victims all did a terrific job.I enjoyed this slightly more than Scream 2, but much less than the original. I rated it a 7/10.  Craven's once fresh approach to horror is still good, but it is starting to get threadbare.  If there is going to be a fourth installment in the trilogy (would that be a quadology?), Craven needs to get creative again and take the genre to the next level or risk running out of gas.",Scream 3

Blood and guts abound, but not as much as the first installments of the trilogy.There's some standard Wes Craven effects throughout that make it watchable, but I didn't seem to get into this film as much as the first two.Arquette and Cox - now a real life married couple - are at least convincing, must be the practice!Oh, but Neve Campbell is still gorgeous!",Scream 3

It's better than Scream 4 for sure. I disagree with a lot of people that Scream 4 is better than Scream 3. I liked the start of the movie, but it was sad to see one of the popular characters (Cotton) die. I think that was a mistake from the makers or producers. It should've been someone else in his place. I wanted Cotton alive. He's funny. He's innocent. There wasn't much of Sidney Prescott in Scream 3. She was missing for a large part of the movie. I say that particularly because she's the main character of the series. She still plays a big part in Scream 3. In Scream and Scream 2, it was easy to figure out who the killers were. In Scream 3, however, it was hard to figure out who the killer was. It had me guessing right till the end, yet I still couldn't figure it out. That's why I like Scream 3, and I think it's better than Scream 4. Everyone knows Scream is a ""horror"" movie, but these same people are forgetting that Scream is also a ""mystery"" movie which is one of the popular movie genres. There was so much mystery surrounding Scream 3 compared to Scream, Scream 2 and Scream 4. I liked the killer in Scream 3, and I liked the way it sounded. The killer sounded horrific! That's how it should be. The makers or producers got that spot on. Scream 3 is the most interesting of the Scream movies. I'm talking about the story. Scream, however, is still the best movie by miles. These are the reasons why I think Scream 3 is the third best movie in the series.",Scream 3

110,LoneWolfAndCub,"The Worst In The Series, But Not A Terrible Movie",5,19 November 2005,"Scream 3, directed by the horror legend Wes Craven, is incorrectly regarded as one of the better in the series. It is most definitely the worst, probably due to a different writer. The previous two films were written by Kevin Williamson, this was written by Ehren Kruger. This movie doesn't have the same jist the others had. The deaths are boring and tame, the dialogue isn't as witty and the movie just has a feel of being poorly done.Sidney (Neve Campbell) is in hiding. She has isolated herself from the world. Stab 3 is in production but there is one problem. The cast are being killed of one-by-one (as you would have guessed by now). There is a twist though, the killer is leaving pictures of Maureen Presscott, Sidney's mother, at every death scene. This draws Sidney out of hiding into a final confrontation with the killer.The acting in Scream 3 is, as with all the Scream films, very good. Neve Campbell is always great as Sidney, David Arquette always good as Dewey and Courtney Cox-Arquette hilarious as Gale Weathers. The supporting cast is great again. Parkey Posey is the stand-out as Jennifer Jolie. There is also Patrick Dempsey as Detective Kincaid, Scott Foley as Roman Bridger and Jenny McCarthy as Sarah.The few problems I (and many other people) have are the following: 1. The deaths in this are just not creative or scary enough. In this almost every death is a stab in the back.2. There is not enough witty, movie based dialogue in this.3. The ending seemed to quick. A lot of deaths were shoved into the end.Other then these annoyances it is still an enjoyable movie. If only Williamson wrote it.2½/5.",Scream 3

There is occasionally some neat things to look at, but overall, these movies are all the same and not very brain stimulating.With that said, I thought ""Scream 3"" was ok, a bit redundant, but it was ok I guess.  I have a number of friends that say they like this one better than ""Scream 2"", I can't really say I agree...I think they were about the same.The only think I thought this film really had going for it was that they had a special appearance by Jamie Kennedy, Patrick Warburton (such a cool actor), Jenny McCarthy (looking better than ever, but don't get attached, she gets killed rather quickly) and some cool cameos: Carrie Fisher, Kevin Smith, and Jason Mewes.Well, if you do end up seeing this film, I hope you enjoy it more than I did.

113,jhaggardjr,"Mostly entertaining, but enough already",6,22 June 2000,"""Scream 3"" is supposed to be the final movie in the ""Scream"" series. I hope it is. Even though the movie is for the most part entertaining, it's not as good as the first two movies. Neve Campbell (Sidney), Courtney Cox Arquette (Gale), and David Arquette (Dewey) are back. So is director Wes Craven. But one big element did not come back for the third installment. Kevin Williamson, who wrote the screenplays for ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" (here he's billed as a producer). The writer for ""Scream 3"" is Ehren Kruger, and his screenplay lacks the wit and humor of the first two films. Also, even though Campbell and the Arquettes are fine as usual, the new supporting characters aren't very interesting. The first two movies had good supporting characters played by the likes of Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett, and Jamie Kennedy (who turns up here in a cameo). The supporting characters in ""Scream 3"" are mediocre at best. Scott Foley (terrific on TV's ""Felicity) acts too sullen as the director of ""Stab 3"", a movie based on the events that took place in the first two movies; Parker Posey acts too obnoxious as an actress who's playing Cox's role in the movie that's being shot; Carrie Fisher turns up in a pointless cameo as if she just woke up from a bad hangover; Jenny McCarthy is wasted as another actress in the movie; and Lance Henriksen (from TV's ""Millennium"") isn't given much to do as a studio owner that's distributing ""Stab 3"". The only new character that's interesting is Patrick Dempsey who's good as a detective who's assigned the case when the murders begin. There are other supporting characters in ""Scream 3"", but none of them make a good impression. ""Scream 3"" is good if you like standard slasher flicks, but if you're expecting comic relief, you're likely to be disappointed like I was. It's not real bad, but I expected it to be better than it turned out.**1/2 (out of four)",Scream 3

It's a dull, uninspired piece of work that feels more like the result of contractual obligation than anything. It's so far removed from the few appreciated elements of the original that it's a mere shadow of its former self.Sidney Prescott can't catch a break yet again; Gail and Dewey are madly in love (which nobody cares about) and the movie tries to weave these storylines in with a straightforward slasher for the third time, but to no real avail.It was sold as the end of a trilogy when it was originally released, and perhaps that would've been the best way to go instead of continuing it on again past that. But this film just isn't good and, when viewing it without the nostalgic glasses, there isn't much that can be said in terms of positivity. Had it been in the 80-90 minute mark like it's predecessors, it might've been a better fleshed out and more interesting movie, but it's just a bland drama/horror fusion that is too focused on the former to maintain the interest of a horror fan like myself.",Scream 3
115,SKG-2,So-so finale,7,10 February 2000,"WARNING: PLOT POINTS ARE GIVEN AWAY, SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE OR DON'T WANT TO KNOW, PLEASE DO NOT CONTINUE READINGAs I've said before, I have little use for sequels, which was I was surprised to find myself going to SCREAM 2, and even more surprised that I enjoyed it.  Like the first one, it was fast, scary, funny, and took some nice satiric jibes.  Even the much debated identity of the killer in the second one made sense as a satiric swipe at horror movies, so it didn't bother me.  I didn't know if they'd be able to keep it going for a third movie, especially when hearing Kevin Williamson's involvement was going to be minimal(he's a producer, and he wrote an outline which eventual writer Ehren Kruger worked from), but I liked the first two, I was especially pleased to see Scott Foley(from FELICITY) and Parker Posey in the cast, and I was intrigued to see what happened.  In retrospect, I probably should have waited for video.Certainly the opening shows a little promise; instead of the usual celebrity cameo, we have a spoof of that, with Cotton Weary(Liev Schrieber), who's now a Geraldo-type talk show host, complaining about having to do a cameo in STAB 3(the movie within a movie here), so we know it's spoofing itself.  The problem, of course, is we know Cotton's going to get killed, but Craven is able to draw suspense throughout the scene.  We also get the stated purpose here during the phone call(which, also a bit clever, starts out with a woman's voice before the familiar tone of Roger L. Jackson as THE voice kicks in); the killer wants to find Sidney.Sidney, of course, is living in seclusion, under a new name and barely going outside the house(which, of course, is under heavy alarm), so at first, she's almost like an afterthought to the movie.  Instead, the center is on Gail Weathers, the tabloid reporter, now an entertainment reporter, who uses her reporter skills to play detective when Cotton is killed, and she decides to assist the police, specifically Detective Kincaid(Patrick Dempsey), in the case.  Then there's Dewey, who's a technical advisor to STAB 3, the movie, and they of course worry about what's going to happen.There's all kinds of potential here, and it's directed well, but it isn't written as well as I think Williamson would have done.  There are scares which still work, and while the Dewey/Gail relationship seems a little old hat, the two Arquettes obviously like working with each other, and their familiarity with us helps smooth that over.  Also, while Campbell is disconnected, she's still sympathetic, and while she doesn't have the same fun with herself as she did in the first one, I understood that.  And there is humor, most of it coming from Posey as the actress playing Gail in STAB 3; few actresses can make contempt funny like she can.  There's also the standard satiric bite(the bodyguard who guarded Julia Roberts and Salman Rushdie but ends up toast here).But as I said, it isn't written as well, and the primary weakness is the killer.  In some senses, I guess, having the director(Foley) be the killer makes sense, because he has the technical expertise to handle things.  But it seems to come out of nowhere, and perhaps to distract us from that, Kruger gives us the idea of him being a long-lost relative of Sidney's, which is ridiculous.  Perhaps because of that too, Foley goes way over the top, which is funny at first, but then becomes tiresome.  Also, Kruger cribs not from other horror movies here, but from the first SCREAM(the cloning of the cell phone being a prime example).  And while Williamson's red herrings were pretty clever, this one seems not thought out.  Emily Mortimer's character(she plays the actress who plays Sidney) is a perfect example; there are two indications she might be the killer(three, if you count the woman's voice to Cotton), and yet she's killed off almost as an afterthought.  Finally, as to compensate for all of this, there are a lot more killings to cover up.  Which begs the question; if all he wanted was to find Sidney(as stated early on several times), why not just take Dewey, Gail, and Cotton et al hostage?  The first two movies mocked the Idiot Plot Rule; this one mostly personifies it.It's a shame, because there could have been something made from all this(oh, almost forgot; Dempsey, who I normally don't like, is surprisingly good, and also unrecognizable here).  But this certainly doesn't break any rules. Even the Jamie Kennedy cameo seems obligatory rather than fresh.  This suggest they should have stopped at the second one.",Scream 3
116,AKS-6,Surprisingly good,6,14 April 2000,"I have stopped expecting things from the Scream-series. Don't get me wrong, I preferred the sequel to the original, but it would be asking too much of a filmmaker to actually make a trilogy where the films keep getting better and better until the end. Especially not now, when original screenwriter Williamson hasn't written the script. So, I didn't have any expectations and I assume that's why I wasn't disappointed at all by this third ""Scream"". I certainly do not think it's as good as the first or second ""Scream"", but as far as horror films go, ""Scream 3"" is a pretty good film. Some of the jokes were simply repetitions and the murders were basically the same as in the previous films, but it was still entertaining enough to *not* be a disappointment. There were a few parts of the film that dragged, but other than that I would say that it is a pretty good film for being the third, and last (I certainly hope it's the last, otherwise *I* will scream), in a trilogy.And of course, Dewey is absolutely adorable!!! :-)  (6/10)",Scream 3
117,chrisbrown6453,The final installment of the highly successful Scream Trilogy lives up to the standards the first two set.,8,17 June 2002,"With the original stars coming back, and a load of new friends and killers entering the fray, Scream 3 was a highly entertaining and satisfying end to the most original horror film to come down the pike in a generation.
Scream 3 takes place after our heroine Sidney (Neve Campbell) has graduated from college. She's now living up in the hills somewhere, determined to put the horrors of her life behind her. If you remember in Scream 2, they were making a film about the events that took place in the original Scream, entitled Stab! Well now they're filming the 3rd installment of the Stab! trilogy, called, well Stab 3! Our favorite cop Dewey (David Arquette) is now an advisor on the set. Gale Weathers is still a reporter, and when Cotton Weary (the man accused by Sidney in the first movie) is murdered in his home, the detective on the case (Patrick Dempsey) calls Gale to come and help.One by one the people on the set of Stab 3 are being killed off. The only clues left behind are pictures of Sidney's dead mother. Who's coming after Sidney now? Has everything we believed from the first two movies been wrong? Is there someone else out there who's been behind everything all along? Or has one of our favorite characters finally snapped? After a slow opening, Scream 3 kicks it into high gear with a lot of brutal killings, and a surprise ending that finally ends the nightmare for Sidney.
I love true horror films. And the Scream movies are definitely some of the best of the genre. It has taken horror films to another level. It's no longer just good enough to kill innocent scantily clad women (not that I don't enjoy that as well), you need to write the movie with the understanding that the audience is smarter than in the past (when it comes to movies at least). And the one thing the Scream series doesn't do is insult the intelligence of their audience. Scream 3 continues in the tradition of its counterparts by having smart dialogue, and creating a believable story line (for a horror film). While the eventual conclusion may leave some people with a bad taste in their mouth, I personally feel satisfied with it. A lot of horror film series (which shall remain nameless) keep going in the series, without ever coming to an end. This time, director Wes Craven has made a movie trilogy that comes to a final conclusion. Sure, as with all horror films, there could be another installment, but no one wants that. By bringing the major story arc to a finish, and by explaining how and why the entire series got started in the first place, the story ends without p***ing off the audience.As usual, the acting is pretty sharp (with the exception of Jenny McCarthy who still looks great, but needs to work on her ""scared"" look). Along with the characters mentioned above, there were other good turns by Parker Posey (playing Gale Weathers in the Stab! series), Scott Foley (of Felicity fame) as the director of Stab 3, Lance Henriksen as the Producer of the Stab! series, and two special cameos by Carrie Fisher and Jaime Kennedy (by means of videotape). I especially liked bringing Kennedy's character back (even though he was killed off in the last movie) and having him explain the rules of a trilogy. It's things like that that keep the Scream movies fresh and entertaining. The script (this time not written by Kevin Williamson but by Ehren Kruger (nice name)) was well written and kept the spirit of the first two films alive, while still creating a new story with a lot of new characters.So overall, I found Scream 3 very entertaining and fun to watch. I thought that it did a good job of using elements of the first two movies to create the story, and then giving the audience a final ending to one of the best trilogies of all time.",Scream 3

He managed to do it very well in the first one, and the second one had its moments too. The third time around, we start to see the tricks of the trade.  We know that there will be one or two false scares before the big one.  We know what to listen for with the music and we know that if you don't have top billing in the credits, chances are you won't survive.  What made the first Scream so much fun was the fact that you didn't know what was going to happen.   It's too bad that the final Scream is so uneven.

The Hollywood angle and certain character developments, mostly Dewey, were a little cornball. Perhaps the most laughable, eye-rolling spectacle was a cameo scene by, minor spoiler Jay and Silent Bob. That was definitely a what the hell is that for moment. However, Scream never does turn away from a bit of comedy and Scream 3 did provide some funny lines and creative twists. Along with the story-line, the newly introduced supporting cast was perhaps the worst aspect of the film. Besides the main four returning cast members (Campbell, Cox, Arquette and Schreiber), there wasn't one actor or actress who stepped up to the plate to bring out a good role. The ending isn't totally predictable but it isn't as sly as the first two. Scream 3 is still enjoyable but is a weaker film, one of Craven's overall bottom films.",Scream 3

It is meant to over the top, answering any remaining questions from the previous films, and you can tell Craven was having fun making it. As always, for me at least, Neve gives a fine performance, doing that thing she does with her eyes and lips at every chance, and although she does seem a bit tired of the whole role, she will go out fighting. The survivors, and Randy, from the other movies, all perform well again, while most of the new additions are simply there to be slaughtered. The guesswork is still there, but it is not a primary part of the film, and there are plenty of gory, funny deaths to keep us amused. I saw an advance screening of this when it first came out, and had a row of girls behind me, screaming and booting me in the back at the slightest opportunity. No, it wasn't as scary as they made it out to be, but it has its moments: Mother coming up the path, was one I found quite disturbing first time round, and the opening scene is pretty good too. For me, the highlights are not the in-jokes, (Carrie Fisher's appearance etc), which are good, but the scenes which go for pity and sadness. Randy's video tape always brings a tear, as does Neve's discovery at the end. Strange for a horror movie, even more strange for one which is 35% spoof, to have that kind of emotion, but it's what always set the Scream series apart from the countless other teen slashers of the time.

And so film geek Randy comes back from beyond the grave to explain to us what's going on one last time, as the Scream trilogy, as it was originally intended, comes to an end with a satisfying tale of jealousy and revenge.Scream, in the end, is a series made by a horror movie nerd for the entertainment of horror movie nerds, and this third film is as nerdy as they come. We get one of the original 80's teen flick nerds Patrick Dempsey as the love interest, we get the love interest from Felicity, Scott Foley, as the killer, and we learn that even nerds like Randy and Cotton Weary can and did get the girl in the end.Scream 3 picks up a few years down the track from the second instalment. Cotton now hosts a talk show with the cringe inducingly punny title 100% cotton. Dewey and Gale have broken up again, Gale is back to being a current affairs anchor while Dewey is now an assistant on Stab 3, the latest instalment of the film series based on the 'real life' Woodsboro Murders. Sidney is living in seclusion working as a counsellor for the women's help hotline, with only Dewey and her father knowing where she actually is.But when the kills happen in this one, the victims are accompanied by a photo of Sidney's mother, Maureen Prescott, the very first victim in the Woodsboro murders, all of them showing her around the age of 18, the only time in her life when no one knows where she was or what she was doing.From this interesting and promising opening comes a pretty decent little mystery/ comedy/ thriller. I really enjoy the consistent internal logic and characterisations in this film compared to the first two films in the series.The newer characters, specifically Parker Posey's faux Gale and Phil Roman are very enjoyable additions to the cast. Cameos from Carrie Fisher, Jay and Silent Bob, and a minor role for Lance Henrickson further up the enjoyment. Dempsey's tortured cop and his droll partner are good as well.The resolution is reasonably satisfying and the well realised.

The original film flirted so close with becoming art, a true classic deconstruction of the film genre.  It didn't quite deliver, either because the screenwriter wasn't smart enough, or just didn't want to bog us down with TOO much horror movie trivia.Neither of the sequels fulfill the promise of the first one, but this is not art.  A good scary movie, yes... suspenseful, bigger budget, and much scarier than the previous ones, I'd say... but this wasn't a parody of the horror genre.  It was just another scary movie, and while you could argue that Scream 2 was either a bad sequel, or just a parody of one... well, this was just a pretty decent sequel, with much less to read into it than the others.

But what makes Scream 3 exceptional for me is the inclusion of Parker Posey in its cast. I looove Parker Posey and how she plays neurotic so hilariously. Unfortunately, while I always enjoy her performances, I haven't liked most of her movies. I'm not a fan of the Christopher Guest troupe movies, and all too often Posey's a supporting character with not enough scenes. Well she is too in this movie but at least she was on screen enough to make herself the best part of it.

Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette return, as does another Ghostface killer. All of this nonsense is backed by an early-2000s soundtrack includes Creed and Fuel. Remember them?The bulk of ""Scream 3"" is a movie-within-a-movie, taking place on the set of ""Stab 3"", the movie series based on the Woodsboro murders. At one point, the Ghostface killer faxes (well, it was 2000) script pages which plots out a real-time murder. There's even a cameo from Jay and Silent Bob. To be fair, ""Scream 3"" does delve into Maureen Prescott's backstory, with Sidney having visions of her, and Maureen a crucial part of Ghostface's motivation.Speaking of which, the all-important Ghostface reveal is again linked to Sidney, with ""Stab 3"" director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) revealed to be Maureen's long-lost son and out to get Sidney after he was rejected by Maureen, with his revenge plot going all the way back to the original ""Scream"" (one of many callbacks to the first film).At this point, it feels like they've run out of ideas, and it's just as well the series was rested for a decade before the fourth movie in 2011.

If you liked 'Scream' and 'Scream 2', I recommend this film.(SPOILER) The main problem with 'Scream 3' is that it slightly over-killed the cleverness of the first two films (I liked 'Scream 2':)). The premise was decent enough but it lacked the spark, suspense and satirical nature of 'Scream' and 'Scream 2'! The cameo from Jay and Silent Bob wasn't that great, personally I thought the best bit was the cameo from Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks. Saying that, although 'Scream 3' is my least favourite out of the three, it's still very watchable and it still consists of a similar style and humour of the original two- but lacked in effectiveness!

But the new Ghostface killer is trying to draw her back to him by murdering the actors of the latest movie in the 'Stab' saga, 'Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro', directed by aspiring filmmaker Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), beginning with talk show host Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) and his girlfriend Christine (Kelly Rutherford), then offing actress Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy) and leaving photos of a young Maureen Prescott, during a period of her life no-one, excluded maybe the ambiguous producer John Milton (Lance Henricksen) knows anything about.Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) is actually called on for help by the detective assigned to the cases, Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey), because of her expertise with the Woodsboro Murders, and meets up again with Dewey (David Arquette), which we found out she had left to pursue her career.He hasn't been waiting for her, though; he's involved with the actress Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), who *coincidentally* plays Gale in the movie.And as more and more actors (played by Matt Keeslar, Patrick Warburton, Emily Mortimer and Deon Richmond among others) fall victim to Mr. Ghostface, Sydney is forced out of her hiding and face this killer for the final battle...As a third part, Scream 3 is a little ho-hum, especially because of the decision of having Dewey and Gale as the main characters in this movie, which doesn't exactly work well since 'Scream' is all. About. Sydney.Dempsey hasn't got an exactly big role, but hey, he lives, and isn't a jerk (mostly). Schreiber is very good as usual and everybody seems well in part, with the exception of Emily Mortimer, who wails and annoys.Ehren Kruger (who also wrote 'The Ring') has a very different style, which doesn't always work, but when it does, it actually does, and Wes Craven's direction makes it all a little better.Not bad, but not memorable either.Scream 3: 6 1/2/10.",Scream 3

I thought the plot was decent and it kept me intrigued till the end. One issue I had with this movie and also in Scream 2 is that I find the reasoning of some of the main characters being reunited a bit weird and not believable. I don't know how Sidney managed to survive at the end; They should've stuck with the original ending even though it might have been boring, at least it would be a bit more believable.

134,SamJamie,The lowest point of the franchise.,6,25 September 2020,"Scream 3 is a 2000 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Ehren Kruger. It stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Patrick Dempsey, Scott Foley, Lance Henriksen, Matt Keeslar, Jenny McCarthy, Emily Mortimer, Parker Posey, Deon Richmond, and Patrick Warburton. In the third installment to this franchise, a murdering spree begins to happen again; this time targeted toward the original Woodsboro survivors and those associated with the movie-inside a-movie, Stab 3. Sydney must face the demons of her past to stop the killer(s).The Scream franchise falters with this unconvincing wrap-up to the original trilogy. The cast is good, as is director Wes Craven's inventive staging of a couple of classic Scream kills, splashes of blood, a depraved new addition to the Maureen Prescott story, and Roger Corman shows up for a cameo. Not so good is the absence of hip cross-references to the classic horror tropes that made us fall in love with the original. The self-referential setup is in place, but not the ingenuity or wit to take advantage of it - It's a shame to see what was once such a sharp series almost go out on such a dull note.More than anything Scream 3 feels dragged-out and repetitive with the thrill seemingly gone. The minute Kevin Williamson said no to writing Scream 3, that should have been the end of it -- until he agreed of course. The plot doesn't work as well as it should and what's left is a film with all the superficial features of a Scream movie and none of the heart, brains, guts or laughs. The film turns the franchise into the type of conventional slasher saga that the first two films so effectively lampooned.

It probably would've been a lot better with the striking writing of Kevin Williamson, but Ehran Kruger is writing the story instead. That's the worst component of Scream 3, and it completely ruins everything.At least Wes Craven is still executing the script, alongside the Scream movie's classical cast. There's some decent ideas in there as well, including the set of Stab 3, the rules of survival and Ghostface's slashings. But once again, they are all ruined by the terrible pacing, which connects to the poor writing.The ideas, characters and kills are all that save this overrated instalment from being a complete waste. Will Scream fans enjoy it? There's a good chance that super huge fans of the idea involving horror movie survival will remember it being an okay movie.

When the murderer begins to leave pictures of Sidney's deceased mother, Sidney is soon drawn to the set of ""Stab 3"" (based on her experiences from the previous films)alongside her fellow survivors, reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox-Arquette) and retired officer Dewey Riley (David Arquette). Other players such as Parker Posey, Emily Mortimer and Scott Foley as members of the film-within-a- film join the three original cast members (with a brief cameo by Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks with posthumous advice to survive a trilogy).

138,happyendingrocks,"Apparently, the rule of trilogies dictates that the third installment makes absolutely no sense",5,21 July 2009,"Though by far the weakest overall episode of the trilogy, Scream 3 boasts a few moments of inspiration that help it overshadow the dreadful film it followed.1) Neve Campbell's returning Sidney remains the strongest link in the character chain here, and recasting her as a isolated and agoraphobic women's crisis line counselor does a bit to assuage our fears after Scream 2 that our central protagonist had become as annoying and unlikeable as everyone else who survived the first two films.2) The idea of this film occurring somewhat inside another film adds an interesting twist to the already tired formula, and the movie's mockery of the studio system re-introduces some of the parody elements that made the first Scream so refreshing.3) Parker Posey is awesome in every movie she's in.That pretty much ends any dissection of the positive attributes of Scream 3, because nearly everything else in this outing is derivative of the original film, and delivered with such mirthless temerity that even the excellent array of cameos plays like a gimmick. This film has a number of ridiculous moments that skirt the bounds of acceptability, and while the first Scream used intelligence as a scare tactic, this one induces headaches with its inherent stupidity.The whole gang is back, but by now they've ceased being endearing. Cotton Weary was never given to us as anything but a sleazy shyster trying to make a buck off of tragedy, so are we supposed to care about his peril as the killer stalks him and his stereotypical blonde Los Angeles nymphette through the halls of their swanky apartment? Gail Weathers and Dewey have already suffered mortal wounds twice and survived them just fine, so do we honestly believe that they are in any danger as they get swept into the killer's web? Jamie Kennedy already shifted from witty to ""someone please punch him in the throat"" in Scream 2, so are we really supposed to think it's clever that he turns up for a cameo in this film, despite being sufficiently butchered in the previous one? Butchery that he apparently saw coming, since he took time to record the videotaped message that serves as the ludicrous excuse for his appearance? The videotaped message that predicts the murders will continue into a third epidemic, despite the fact that the when he's recording said videotaped message he has no idea who the killer is, or how the series of events in Scream 2 has played out? The videotape he handed to his sister to be played in the event that he was killed during the second outbreak of violence, thus not around to dispense his wisdom if and when a third outbreak outbroke? Really? Seriously, guys? The finale of this film is by far more insultingly absurd than the silly and thudding finish of Scream 2, and once the killer (or killers?) responsible for the meager murder-spree is (are? this is getting confusing) revealed, we're quickly assured that not only was there no point to any of the killing in the movie we've just seen, but that the two films we saw before it were just as overtly senseless.Of course, we already know that the notion of a trilogy is a dead issue, since a fourth Scream film is currently in production. So, since the trilogy is over, would that qualify the upcoming Scream film as a ""re-imagining""? Randy never gave us rules for a reboot (although I'm sure his animatronic corpse will pop up in Scream 4 to fill us in), but we can certainly hope that the stipulations dictate that even if a reboot retains the weaknesses of a sequel, it at least attempts to remind us why we loved the original so much.

The setting is Hollywood now, and the new Stab movie 'Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro' is about to released. We get an opening scene murder of a familiar face to the 'Scream' series, and that's when the fun begins. Gale and Dewey are back on the scene trying to help the cops solve the case, and Sidney eventually joins them from her secluded farmhouse. Pretty soon more of the cast members of Stab 3 start getting picked off in the order that they die in the movie, leading to a bloody conclusion at the director's mansion in Hollywood in which we learn some hidden secrets of Sidney's mother Maureen Prescott.'Scream 3' is without a doubt the weakest of the original three films. However when the weakest film of a trilogy is as good as this is, that doesn't really matter. I enjoyed 'Scream 3' for many reasons, one of which is the Holloywood setting! It's fun to watch a movie within a movie, and we get film sets and director's mansions and cameos from movie stars. This one delivers in that aspect. I also like the idea of having the cast of ""Stab 3"" murdered off in a specific order, as well as the Maureen Prescott mystery. Almost every time the killer murders someone, a photo of Maureen in her younger days is left at the scene. So I thought that was good as well.The acting was top notch again from all the regulars, as well as some new characters played by Jenny McCarthy, Parker Posey and Deon Richmond. I thought Parker Posey who was playing an actress who was playing Gale Weathers in ""Stab 3"" did a fantastic job in a comedic role. Courtney Cox and Posey running around and away from ghostface was hilarious, the two worked well together! The blood and gore seemed less than the previous films, but still effective enough.'Scream 3' isn't as good as the first two for the reason that it does copy a lot of what we've already seen. That's the problem with sequels usually, and why they fail to surpass the original. It's stuff we've already witnessed. But I enjoyed this enough to highly recommend it, it's a great horror film that has quite a few intense moments. And the killer's identity was pretty good as well8/10",Scream 3
142,Shiva-11,It's time to put this series to rest before it becomes a parody of itself.,7,7 February 2000,"Scream 3: Poor Sidney.  After weathering the murder of her mother, being slandered in the press, and escaping the clutches of psychotic killers, not once, but twice (sending scores of screaming young men and women to the Grim Reaper in the process), she appears to have found peace living a life of solitude..  Unfortunately, the killing isn't over yet.  Actors on the set of Stab 3 - a movie based on the Woodsboro murders - are being butchered like livestock, and once again, Sidney becomes a target.  The first installment of the trilogy was timely: the teen slasher genre was alive and well, and bloodier than ever.  An informal set of rules governed the actions of all victims-to-be: any couples having sex had to die, people always split up to look for the killer, the first place to be searched was a cellar or similar dark and dangerous location, flashlights always died and no one ever carried a weapon.  Scream embraced these rules (and many others) and tried to circumvent them at the same time.  Once the rules were set, Scream 2 went about bending the rules, most importantly core characters were brutally done away with.  Finally, in the last (?) installment, the rules no longer apply and anything goes.  Or at least that's what we're told. There are a couple good scares, several wonderful cameos (my favorite was Roger Corman's character who is rails against the violence in films and their negative effects on society, but I was apparently the only one who got it) and well spaced moments of hilarity.  Unfortunately the theme is growing thin. The victims are as one dimensional as those in any second rate blood fest. They have no connection with the main character, and are simply accessories waiting to meet their inglorious ends.  It is interesting to note that whereas many well-known actors were dispatched in the sequel, only one ""name"" victim gets offed in this outing. I was also annoyed that the characters do everything they're not supposed to do - apparently Randy's wisdom died with him. And what's with Cox and Arquette?  They look horrible: she is haggard and emaciated, while he appears to have absorbed all the pounds she lost, and the chemistry between them is nonexistent. But most frustrating was the fact that they resorted to a cheat this time around (I won't spoil it, but it has to do with the killer) rather than spending more time on the script.  Don't get me wrong, the movie was fun, just not as fresh or clever as the earlier installments and it is time to let it Rest in Peace.",Scream 3

There were things I liked about Scream 3 and some things I did not like, the acting in the film is honestly not the best but Neve Campbell does do her best and succeeds in it, all of the other actors and actresses are very meh, even Cox and Arquette were bland enough in this. The characters in the film were also pretty blunt being very paper thin, Parker Posey also appears in this film as one of the most annoying characters of all time, I was literally just waiting for her throat to be slashed in a very happy way..sorry, I sound so messed up.

The plotlines are just getting too far-fetched, and there's only so much mileage left. This premise is running on fumes.      Sydney Prescott is again the object of yet a different serial killers rage, using the same devices as the first two movies. Right, like ""duh"" you say.       However, the poblem with SCREAM 3 is, besides the gaping holes in the script (like how did the killer eventually get her phone number in the back woods? This event happened before Dewey called her. The Kettles and the Clampetts would've had a darned hard time tracking her phone number down in the Ozarks...let alone the serial killer guy...) is that the movie didn't know when to ease off on the comedy and deftly blend in the tension/suspense/horror or what have you. It just moved in a clunky fashion. A pretty mixed bag for the series swan song.       The series regulars perform up to the expected par, with special mention to Parker Posey, for her humorous turn as the ""Stab 3"" Gail Weathers. She had some of the best moments in the film.      Wes Craven knows his craft, as I'm sure he'll scare our pants off some more in the future, and I can't wait. However, I hope he lets this trilogy stay just that.",Scream 3

It wants to be tongue in cheek parodying itself through having the cast mixed up with the cast who are making a film series based on the original events of ""Scream"". However it doesn't change the fact that it's all a bit tired. I was never once filled with tension throughout the proceedings and each death was greeted with a shrug. The movie felt like it was only made because they needed a sequel to close the franchise - there was no love in this movie.It's not all bad. I didn't feel in pain or bored by the movie but never ever caught up either. Neve Campbell took her time turning up to star in her movie (I don't blame her) and then, much like the rest of the cast, wandered around aimlessly. The ""killer"" turned out to be an utter disappointment (much like ""Scream 2""). The acting was as much as you'd expect from such a franchise (i.e. what acting?). The black humour of ""Scream"" had been replaced with irritating irony.In the end watch ""Scream 3"" if you're a completist or extremely bored.

148,Mr_Censored,"Hardly an amazing sequel, but a respectful finish for the ""Scream Trilogy,' nevertheless.",6,19 June 2009,"With ""Scream 3,"" the trilogy started by director Wes Craven (""A Nightmare on Elm Street"") and writer Kevin Williamson (""Dawson's Creek"") comes to a close, re-uniting all surviving characters from ""Scream 2,"" as well as one that didn't make it. Now, obviously with a ""Scream 4"" (is it a sequel? Is it a reboot? Only time will tell) on the horizon, the ""Scream"" trilogy has essentially come unraveled, but what ""Scream 3"" attempts to do is close out the popular 90's defining horror series on a positive, somewhat epic note. Despite its many short-comings, it mostly accomplishes its goals.It's been a few years since tragedy struck a third time at Windsor College and Sidney (Neve Campbell) has forced herself into hiding. While ""Stab 3"" rolls into production (what happened to ""Stab 2""?), a killer strikes with a familiar M.O., slashing his way through the cast, leaving the odd couple of Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale (Courtney Cox) to try to solve the mystery before the killer fleshes out his own un-happy ending. For Sydney, this means digging up old ghosts and coming to terms with tragic truths.To be frank, there's a lot wrong with ""Scream 3,"" but then again, what third sequel in ANY franchise is ever perfect? The biggest shift from the previous flicks is in the toned down gore and uninventive death scenes. Despite the franchise's popularity, it's more than apparent this time around that the MPAA and the studio were growing impatient with on-screen splatter. Meanwhile, the script, drafted by Ehren Kruger (of no relation to Freddy Krueger) is overly jokey, and comes across as b-grade Kevin Williamson, which is pretty sad. A lot of the humor in the film revolves around lampooning Hollywood clichés, but unfortunately, unless you work in the business, these jokes are trite, boring and only serve to bog down the real story at hand.The film's strongest point is the who-dunnit theme, which feels bigger and more important than in the previous two films. There's an unsettling sense of mystery that carries the film and keeps it interesting when many of the other ideas presented are stale. Also, the chemistry between David Arquette and Courtney Cox helps make up for an overabundance of unlikeable characters in the film, portrayed by likable character-actors such as Parker Posey and Patrick Warburton. The ending and the final reveal of the killer – while slightly contrived – makes for a perfectly satisfying ending that wraps the trilogy up in a nice and neat little bow. Overall, an enjoyable conclusion that lags in pacing and indulges a bit too much in itself, but more than makes up for it in the end. As far as third entries in horror franchises go, ""Scream 3"" could be a lot worse.Look out for a cameo from Jay & Silent Bob, as well as the always-great Lance Henrikson as a seedy B-movie mogul.",Scream 3

Definitely the weakest in the franchise but I still have alot fun with the movie and its a good addition to the franchise just not as good as the others in my opinion.With the new Stab movie being realised there starts a series of killings with the a person killing them in the order they die in the movie.
However there 3 different scripts so there are so many possibilities.The story in this one isn't the best in my opinion but it's alot of fun and Neve Campbell shines once again as Sidney Prescott.The reveal of the killer I really like and I really do like the twist it adds alot to the original movie in my opinion and like it. However it is a abit of retcon but they explain that that can happen in a trilogy so again it adds to meta feel of this franchise and I like that.The side characters are boring in this one and some are annoying you're literally just waiting for them to die with exception of Roman who has a big part in the movie later on he's a good character.Still a fun movie but definitely the weakest I would only watch if I'm marathoning the franchise.
However I do like ending the scene with Sidney leaving the door open because she feels save and feels like its over was a good ending to the series and Sid got her happy ending I would of been OK with the series ending.Verdict 7/10 Weakest of the lot but still alot of fun in my opinion.",Scream 3

Incredible !!! This means he can find NO other solution to tie all 3 movies together except some MYTHICAL device !!! It is MY opinion that Sidney Prescott, will go completely MAD if there is a Scream 4, and become a mass murderer herself !!!If you are looking for some motivation for the murders, Sarah(Jenny McCarthy) for little or no acting ability , Cotton for just being dumb,and anyone else for getting too close !!!I suppose the subplots make the movie more palatable, but at this point, who cares...The Director keeps us guessing as to who the real killer is, until the last 20 to 30 minutes of the film, but he leaves so many clues, even the police can figure Sidney doesn't do it !!!There are several guest performers, but they can't save the film...If you are new to killing and mass murder, then you might get through the film!!!

151,Meredith-7,Disappointing,5,8 April 2000,"I had heard great things about this film before it was released, that it was much better than Part 2, and was on a equal par to the original.  How wrong can people be?  I thought this was by far the weakest entry in the trilogy. The identity of the killer was fairly stupid I thought, with an additional story obviously tacked on to the original story just so they could make a Scream 3.  Neve (Sidney Prescott) seemed to have a smaller role in this film, which was fairly disappointing considering she is meant to be the main character - instead of Gale Weathers and Stewie.  The whole plot was fairly silly, members of the cast of the new movie been killed, people running around a scary old mansion been killed one by one by the killer.  It didn't take much to work out who the killer was, but the question of why was where explanation was needed and was delivered in the final act.  Even the opening scene, which although scary- did not seem to have the shock value of the first two films.  Everyone seemed a little tired of the whole scenario. There were a few good jumpy moments, and Sidney's nightmare sequences were fairly impressive- as was the setting in Stab 3 ( I thought that was used quite effectively).  Patrick Dempsey was great as the cop, it was nice to see him in a decent role for once, as he seemed to disappear in the nineties a little.  There were a lot of great cameos, especially Jay and Silent Bob, but the whole thing seemed a little pointless.  The absence of Kevin Williamson as screen writer was very noticeable - there was no where near as many classic one liners.  It almost seemed like Wes Craven had lost his touch.",Scream 3
152,bayardhiler,I Never Laughed So Hard At A Wes Craven Movie Before.........,7,8 November 2012,"That pretty much sums up ""Scream 3"". The movie tries to be hip and cool like the first two but unfortunately falls victim to the very thing that it was spoofing; the longer horror franchises run the more silly they become. With that said, that doesn't mean ""Scream 3"" isn't entertaining; its just that its entertaining for all the wrong reasons. In this movie, all of the characters have now become celebrities, but lo and behold another Ghostface is on the loose and looking for Sidney Prescott, who's now living in fear and seclusion while working at home as a crisis counselor for women. But she won't be in seclusion for long, as we soon find out that Ghostface is stalking and killing her friends and cast members of the new Stab 3, the movie within a movie spoof, in order to draw her out. The problem is that ""Scream 3"" just doesn't feel like a ""Scream"" movie and the reason why is quite simple; Kevin Williamson did not write it and it clearly shows on screen. Some of the issues include: the fact that the killer can use his voice changer to sound like any one of the characters sounds kind of cool at first but one has to ask how that would be possible, Ghostface using untraditional ways of killing people such as cutting gas lines and blowing up a house, and the problem of Ghostface just not being scary anymore. In the first two movies, Ghostface was human in the sense that people could knock him down and hit him but yet he still managed come across as scary. In this movie, Ghostface gets beat up so much that I can't help but wonder if this is where ""Scary Movie"" got some of the ideas for its jokes. It gets even more hilarious when you learn the identity of the killer, who I will not reveal here, and you're not even sure who he is when he first pulls the mask off because he was such a minor character. If that's not enough the writer, Ehren Kruger, tries to sell us the idea that it was this killer who coached the Ghostface from the first movie on how to kill and even provided him the motivation. Anyone who's seen and loves the first movie should know that's a bunch of bull. Just try not to laugh at all of this and the last part of the movie where Sidney and the killer are beating the living crap out of each other but yet none of them have any bruises to show for it. Bottom line is this ""Scream"" is not a movie you should watch for good horror entertainment. Rather, this is a movie you should watch for a good laugh with friends. 7 out of 10.",Scream 3

I thought that the writing was great, remember they had to keep the plot going for a while. But especially at the end when the ""original"" killer comes out to Sidney about his plan and how he had started the whole thing.The film had its moments of humor but not too much. After all it is a horror flick. The acting was good and so were the special effects - blood. Now everyone's first instinct is to compare it to the first Scream. And of course most people are going to say that it wasn't as good as it. In their opinion maybe not but I think that everybody tends to like an original more than a sequel or in this case a trilogy. The bottom line is that it carried on well and didn't get too old.I'll admit that there was a couple of things that I found pretty hard to believe. For instance, Sidney being able to move after all the pain she must have went through. Who cares! This third installment blew the second one away.   -That's just *my* opinion.",Scream 3
156,kergillian,A poor end to a great trilogy!,5,22 February 2001,"What a disappointment! What a sour follow-up to two fabulous flicks! Sadly, what started as a renaissance of the slasher genre, films of quality not seen since Carpenter's work on Halloween I and II and the Fog...well, maybe *quality* isn't the best word, but you kow what I mean;) What this film truly lacks is Kevin Williamson's writing. Ehren Kruger desperately tries to write like Williamson (which is part of the problem) and fails miserably. Williamson's sharp wit and hilarious satire is missing, as is his keen sense of continuity and plot development. In short: this film drags and lacks plot. The jokes aren't especially funny. The characters are dry. Even Wes Craven seems to be less than interested in making this film. I expected much more from a stellar cast. But even Neve Cambell and the Arquettes' reprising roles seemed to be out of steam. Their characters had dried up...had become generic and stagnant. Indie queen Parker Posey was missing the lustre she has in Dazed and Confused and Henry Fool, Patrick Dempsey's geek-boy charm was washed out, Lance Henriksen wasn't on screen for nearly long enough...even Jenny McCarthy's breasts couldn't save this film!;) Scream 2 was a sequel well worth watching, it had new sides to it that were exciting and fun to watch, it had twists that were fresh and unexplored in the first film. In many ways it out-paced the first and made for a better film. This film, unfortunately, had a redundant feeling...a 'we've seen it all before' feeling. It begged for that spark of excitement, that breath of fresh air that the other ones had. In the end, it was average. There were enjoyable moments (including the surprise guest appearance of Jay and Silent Bob and Randy's soliloquy from the grave) but they weren't enough to keep this film interesting. And the ending!!! Oh the humanity!!! Just a touch melodramatic!! This was even beyond the normal Hollywood cheeze factory! I haven't felt that nauseated at a horrid Hollywood ending since Face/Off! They should have just killed Sidney and been done with it. I'd recommend this at simply for closure. If one is a fan of the other two, it won't *ruin* the trilogy to see it...it's like Phantom Menace, it sucks but it's still Star Wars. This sucks but it's still Scream. And, also like ep. 1, this isn't bad enough to make me wish I'd never seen it, in fact, it was pretty much what I'd expected, so my expectations had been low and therefore I wasn't overly disappointed.

Being able to prevent a masked killer with her foot by pushing him away at the slightest of touches until he catches us completely off guard and stumbles until she's killed.

158,cofemug,Yawn,1,19 February 2000,"This movie was the worst finale that I have ever seen in horror movie history.  I have seen quite a few of them too.  I had high expectations for this movie until I heard Kevin Williamson wrote the script.  I will give everybody the fact that he can't write anything serious, or completely original, on his own, but he sure can satirize a movie genre.  That was the whole problem, and that seemed to be what Kruger did not understand about the Scream series.  (Although I also hated Arlington Road, his other movie) He seemed to think that Scream 1 and 2 were just horror movies that had jokes about others of the genre.  These were great satires that followed a formula, but acknowledged it by telling the formula.Kruger strayed from the finale formula.  The finales in most horror series have the most explicit death scenes of all.  This one seemed to have almost no gore.  That might have been appropriate for the first one (Halloween had no gore) but not for the last.  (We can forget the crappy H20.)  All finales take risks.  Freddy's Dead had the idea of 3-D glasses, Jason Goes to Hell almost recieved an NC-17, and did get it in the video version.  If this movie did not have the M.F. word, it could have easily recieved a PG-13. JGTH had a death scene in the middle of an orgasm.The movie had a desperate feel to it.  There was one scene where I was laughing, simply because it was funny, that was played out for dramatic purposes.  *SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER*  This was when Randy's sister brings a videotape from Randy describing the ""rules"" of finales.  This would have been played out for laughs in other Screams.  But the ""rules"" were shallow compared to the other rules of the game.  They all boil down to ""all bets are off.""  I thought that this was a hint of things to come, but no...Wes Craven played it safe.  He ripped off John Carpenter for the killer, kept everyone alive, and took away all spice to the series.  There was no special spark in this movie.The opening sequence even fell flat by being extremely stupid and over-played.  There was nothing particularly ball-grabbing about it.  The first sequence in Scream ripped out your mind, and showed you what over-knowledge of movies can do.  It was a highly original opening, even if it did rip off movies like ""Don't answer the phone.""  The second one had an even more original opening that called attention to movies like RHPS.  (if you don't know those initials, get help.)  This one seemed drawn-out and boring.  This should have been the quickest, tensest, and most horrific of all the openings.  Well, maybe not tensest.I couldn't help but hate this stupid, boring, and completely clumsy finale. However, you will like it if you thought the other two were only scary.  If they were not clever or funny or mocking, then you will probably like this one.  However, anybody who does think intelligent things about the Scream series and saw them as mocking movies, will hate this.1/10 (can't give any lower)",Scream 3

The scares are even stronger and appropriate the story is good and the killer is absolutely unpredictable, and even when you see it second time everything fits perfectly. Sidney's nightmares with her mother where awesomely scary, congratulations to both, specially to Maureen. The Worst: The movie didn't work out in the Box Office as well as we all expected, while it wasn't for sure a flop, not even close it could have worked a whole lot better. Rating: 7/10Chapter one: Makes the rules. Chapter two: Brakes the rules. Chapter three: All rules are off!Three years and a half after the Woodsboro incidents, Sydney Prescott moved to California, where she keeps a quite life in a house in the hills, changed her name to Laura while she helps women in distress. This life is secret and alone as she is haunted by the ghost from the past. When at the Stab 3 studios the actors start being murdered by the order as they die in the script, Dewey Riley and Gale Weathers are involved in the researches done by detective Mark Kincaid, due to their involvement in the past experiences. Attracted to the crime spots, Sidney once more has to face  her biggest nightmares and find the strength to defy in this explosive and profound end of the trilogy which changed  forever the story of scary movies.Alongside this movie my all time favourite scary movies are (the misunderstood, but hell fantastic) THE HAUNTING, the original SCREAM, SIXTH SENSE, and THE EXORCIST. True to be said, this movie can't even reach the heels of 1999's THE HAUNTING, the most fantastic psychological and supernatural horror film ever!, but this movie sure keeps on the edge of your seat as well as jumping from it (!) presenting good actors, scared and a plot that scares when it should, makes laugh when needed, and make cry the more sensitive ones.Did anyone else noticed the enormous plot hole? On Scream 2, it was presented Stab, but in this movie, Stab 3 is being shooted and there ain't no reference to any Stab 2!

But only after the movie I realized that I enjoyed it mostly because it had characters I already got to like in the first two movies. Ehren Kruger wrote a decent horror/thriller script, but it didn't add any depth to the characters. The characters Kruger introduced were all boring and flat cannon fodder, with Parker Posey's character being the exception.

The actors in this film should have had the fire that they had proved they could do in the other films. It seems to me as if Wes Craven, The Master, had seriously wanted to do a stellar final act but was held back by the lack of enthusiasm for the project. that is why this is the most marred of the three films.

Perhaps it was because of a new writer? Considering the lackluster script, the drastic tone, and the leisure-like pacing, I can say this was the case. Although, one person can't just take the blame. Craven's direction in this one is uninspired, and the deaths are yawn-inducing, which isn't something great to be said about a slasher.First off, what went right? The gang still shine through. When all else fails, the cast is still a strong one. Also, the film had a semi-interesting climax. The back story was kind of intriguing. Well... that, and it didn't completely suck.Everything else is pretty much went wrong. The script, as previously mentioned, is not a strong one. There's an unneeded back story (which still raises curiosity), which still proves less is more. The killer seems like a cop-out, and overall, I feel the film went the cheap route, even the deaths.Well... the deaths still have to be good. Right? Not exactly. The film is just a stab here, and a stab there. Corn syrup and red food coloring came later. Not to mention, the wit is completely absent.

Wes Craven was able to mask its climax message with an horror series well made avoiding any exaggerations, including a bit of smart humor during the calm phases of his movies.

I personally got mixed reviews of this movie from friends before I saw it.  Some people loved it while others said it sucked.  I wanted to see this movie the night it went into theaters, but tickets were sold out! :(  Plus, my friend wanted to see ""Down To You"" instead!  Oh well!Here's the plot:Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now older, and seems to be at peace in her new home.  Yet still, she keeps her home secured just incase knowing what has happened to her in the past.  Still the spine-chilling deaths of her friends and her mom still haunt.  Meanwhile in the glamorous hills of Hollywood, ""Stab 3"" is being shot.  Director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) is making movie magic along with a list of young (and fictional) actors:  Tom Prinze (Matt Keeslar) as Dewey, Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy) as Candy, Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey) as Gale, Tyson Fox (Deon Richmond) as Ricky, and of course, Angelina Tyler (Emily Mortimer) as the ever famous Sidney. 
From out of the blue, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), the man who was originally accused of murdering Sidney's mom, and his girlfriend, Christine (Kelly Rutherford), are brutally murdered at Christine's home.  Yet Cotton and Christine are only the beginning of the brutal killings that soon take place in young Hollywood.  All of the sudden, little by little, the  cast of ""Stab 3"" are being slained, and the killer's main target is once again, Sidney.  And there's another mystery going around besides the murders of the ""Stab 3"" cast....what happened to Maureen Prescott in the 1970's and what does she have to do with (*fictional*) 70's actress, Rena Reynolds???That's the main plot to the whole story basically.  With the return of Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) and Dewey Riley (David Arquette), and of course, as whole new cast of helpless victims and allies, ""Scream 3"" makes it's mark as the final chapter in the ""Scream"" series. 
""Scream 3"", unlike the first and second ones, offers a little bit of suspense, and a bit of comedy with Parker Posey's character, Jennifer Jolie. It's unpredictable to see who the MAIN killer is (although I guess a lot of people know who it is already even though they didn't see the movie).  I have to say, I found most of the characters quite amusing.  That's probably why some people thought this movie was a bit of joke.Yet I liked ""Scream 3"", and I must say, I'm glad I FINALLY got to see it! :) I wish the ""Scream"" series would continue, but I'm glad it ended the way it did.  Plus, once you see the third one, it connects the first and second ""Scream"" to the third one.  And after you see it, you kind of think to yourself, ""Oh...it all makes sense!""""Scream 3"" didn't leave a lasting impact on everyone who saw this movie, but that's only normal.  Yet to all ""Scream"" fans, the final chapter is truly intense and not to mention unforgettable, and is a true classic that will eventually go down in film history along with it's predecessors (""Halloween"", ""Friday The 13th"", etc.)! :)

167,dirtychild,Fun film but not as good as the original,8,19 February 2005,"Scream 3 is the final chapter of the Scream trilogy - a series of films that not only mocks and lampoons on other films, but also mocks itself.Scream 3 picks up the story a couple of years after the events of the first film. The production of ""Stab 3"" grinds to a halt as a killer picks off the cast in the order that their characters die in the film. This draws the three main protagonists of the series together as they determine who is behind these murders.Scream 3 is a definite improvement over the disappointing second entry. It not only takes the p!ss from other scary movies but also takes the p!ss out of itself and the Scream films. You get a perverse enjoyment out of the actors playing the characters from ""real life"" (eg: Parker Posey doing a Courteney Cox impersonation). It sort of reminds me of that Seinfeld episode where the characters of the pilot episode ""Jerry"" interact with the ""real life"" Seinfeld characters.There are plenty of brilliant in-house film buff jokes too (eg: Jay and Silent Bob making an appearance and a Carrie Fisher look-a-like).Anyhows - this is a horror film - and although there are a couple of scares - it doesn't reach the terrifying level of the original.

The beloved cast of recurring characters, Wes Craven's suspenseful directing, the griping plot and the franchise's signature sense of meta humor makes this a great conclusion to a great slasher movie trilogy that has successfully gone out of it's way to show just how good these movies can be and how they can be done right.",Scream 3

The identity of the killer is not really surprising, and the whole backlog story that goes with it is very had to swallow.Most disappointingly, the death scenes have no impact whatsoever (think Drew Barrymore and Jada Pinkett's deaths in the first two, etc.) Not just are they virtually gore-free but they have no power behind them at all, leaving the movie very much a Disney or Lite version of ""Scream"".To his credit, Ehren Krueger does his best with the script, and no doubt it was difficult coming up with a completely new killer, etc. - and Wes Craven directs with his usual slickness.There are certainly some fine moments - most notably Carrie Fisher's cameo with bite, and the bitch-fights between the Real and the Fake Gale (Parker Posey is the best of the cast, and it's a pity her role couldn't have been to more effect).Despite its bad points, there is enough energy left in the serious for this installment, but it just could have been so much better, especially considering all the time and secrecy invested in the project.""Scream 4""?

The other actors in it are either atrocious or are just really good at pretending to be really atrocious actors in the movie-within-a-movie 'Stab'. The only exception from this would probably be Patrick Dempsey though he is not really in the film for a great amount of time anyway.The plot is a lot better than the second film. Some of the murder sequences are a bit far-fetched and ridiculous but I think this was deliberate. The major difference between this film and 'Scream 2' is you are genuinely shocked when you find out who the killer is because you had no idea. The script is a lot better than the previous film but dialogue between characters is not quite up to scratch. In 'Scream 2' the dialogue was a lot more believable and not quite as wooden.Overall, this film is better than 'Scream 2', not better than the first one but it is definitely worth a watch.

177,WasiReviews,A Comedic Mess,5,10 March 2021,"Coming into this film all I knew from the unfavorable reviews was that most people thought this film was the worst in the franchise and I agree with them still, let's look at this film from a different perspective, shall we? Columbine took its toll on 2000 and early 2001 action and horror blockbuster films. 9/11 and the Iraq war exerted their devastation on Hollywood for at least 5 years from 2001-2006. Most of the horror movies made at the time being about torture **** and other thriller nonsense. Due to the shooting and several copy-cat crimes inspired by Scream (1996) that all the Scream films make fun of, Harvey Weinstein and his lap-dogs had to switch the franchise into a Comedy-Horror instead of a Horror-Comedy. Don't get me twisted there were still some scary scenes. Sadly, the movie looks and feels like a cheesy Sam Raimi Spider-Man film which isn't necessarily a bad thing. A little spice up and cheese doesn't hurt underneath a good scary show. However, the movie took it way too far and ruined it all. Some of Wes Craven's films are straight masterpieces that belong in a museum. The rest of his work belongs in the trash and a few like Scream 3 are just straight mediocre.I find it insane how Scream 3 ( produced by Harvey Weinstein) made fun of Hollywood big guys banging young chicks for acting roles and somehow Hollywood did not know? Apart from everything going on outside of the film, the actual film should have been PG-13; the film barely had any good gore or kills but being a Scream movie the whodunnit, horror, and comedy aspects were still entertaining. I will say that even if this film doesn't entice you; you should still make sure to watch it if you plan on seeing the entire Scream Quadrilogy soon to be a Pentalogoy (if Scream 5 hits theatres in January 2022). We just lived through 2020, I can't rule anything out.",Scream 3

180,drawlife,Mediocre.,5,4 September 2015,"It's an underwhelming third entry to the franchise, but there's some good stuff in it. Unfortunately Scream 3 becomes what it originally it intended to spoof. The scares aren't as effective as the first or the second, but the kills are solid. Liev Schreiber's role is reduced to a cameo, and he's killed from the beginning. To be honest the only really effective kill that means something in the entire film. The killer tormenting Sidney with the death of her mother, while also using her voice are some of the film's strongest elements as well. Though Wes Craven's influence is felt, this film is sorely missing Kevin Williamson's flare. It's obvious that it feels completely different from the first two. Neve Campbell's role feels just a tad bit reduced, mainly because she's isolated herself from everyone and everything. Which is a neat concept to watch because you feel for her paranoia and can understand why she is the way she is after experiencing such traumatic events. David Arquette and Courteney Cox seem like the main characters right from the get-go. Unlike the first two the cast are unlikable aside from the three leads. They are basically fodder. I did however liked Deon Richmond's character for the short amount of time he's in. Some of the characters also make some pretty questionable choices as well. The twist and killer reveal is pretty cool. Scott Foley's character is Roman Bridger, Sidney's half brother. The Scream films have at least two killers, but this is the first time it breaks that rule of having just one killer. Pretty impressive that Roman was able to do all that by himself. We also get a nice special cameo from Jamie Kennedy's Randy. It's alright. It's not terrible, it feels a lot more lighter compared to the first two, but because they are almost perfect examples of a great slasher film it pales in comparison. The movie within the movie, set in Hollywood was an honorable approach but it just wasn't executed the way it should have been. 5/10",Scream 3
181,Phil_H,Mildly entertaining fare.,4,4 February 2000,"For the climax of the trillogy we get a few laughs, a couple of good jolts, but nothing new. It's fair to call this a diversion, a nice diversion, but nothing special. Frankly, I think the absolute highlight of the movie, as well as the secret surprise, is the appearance of Jay and Silent Bob (of Clerks fame).  After their appearance, the film slowly degrades into exactly what these films parody...a lame slasher flick. Pity, there could have been some great new stuff going on, but nothing like that comes out.Might as well leave after Jay and Silent Bob...the rest isn't really worth staying for. I give it a 4.",Scream 3
182,Jerry Ables,A very worthy finale to an awesome trilogy,10,24 May 2002,I think this film is great and serves as an excellent way to close out the awesome Scream trilogy.  It was very well written and acted and has every bit of the creepy thrills and excitement that made its predecessors such a great thrill to watch.  Highly recommended to any horror fan.,Scream 3
183,darkwizard404,Weak compared to the original,6,26 October 2021,This one was somewhat enjoyable but overall very weak compared to the original and the second one. Too many characters and the worst thing was that Sidney was not the main focus until the climax. The side characters had more scenes than her. The kills were not as convincing as the previous movies.,Scream 3
184,clay-8,*** out of ****,7,4 February 2000,"""Scream 3"" leaves a bad aftertaste of a big-budgeted, dumbed-down version of ""Scream"". It flashes its money on the screen. I was surprised at how elaborate, and somewhat boring, this movie was. It definitely felt like it was written by somebody else. I guess since this is the LAST, it decided to go all-out, doing things the other two films didn't want to even think about: Explosions, CG-effects, and the constant investigation of strange noises that occur every five minutes. The film doesn't take itself seriously enough and almost seemed like one big joke. Sidney wasn't a very focused character this time around, and I didn't get the whole emotional thing going.But I liked it. Sidney's first encounter with the killer is both clever and exciting. It's probably the best sequence in the movie, but I grew tiresome of seeing the killer pop out when he wasn't welcomed by the characters or the audience for that matter. There are also annoying and unnecessary dream sequences Sidney has about her mother. The whole back-story was a nice touch and I loved learning the truth about EVERYTHING.""Scream 3"" may be the worst of the series, but it is still fun.",Scream 3

The movie in general was very average,i hardly found any suspense in it,i found more fake scares or as i say ""cliches"". I think Jenna McCarthy is a terrible actor,her acting really flunked in this film. I am fairly sick of the unrealism of this trilogy,first her ""friends"" wanna kill her,then her friends ""relatives"" then,her relative.It is very stupid,its like shes got something eternal going on. I didnt toally dis-like the movie,but it just didnt do it for me.Im still wondering when their going to make true horror type films like they once did decades ago.Overall the film wasnt enjoying,but it wasnt un-likeable.It was a fair film,and is better than part 2,but nowehre near as good pas the original.In total i gave SCREAM 3 a 5.5 out of 10.GOOD POINTS OF FILM: A Few Interesting Plot Recalls.BAD POINTS OF FILM: Exaggerated Triolgy/ Poor Acting/ Highly Unrealistic.",Scream 3
187,Phantasm01,The Only Way To Die Is To Go Out Screaming!,7,25 July 2006,"By the time that Scream 3 was released around the turn of millennium, pretty much everyone in the world was familiar with the style of the film, and its storyline. Such is the immense popularity of this film series that you can't help but not think of it when you think of the horror genre. The first Scream film was ground-breaking and original in every way possible while Scream 2 slightly improved the suspense and nail-biting moments while retaining the same old formula. With Scream 3, director Wes Craven has wisely drawn a line under this phenomenon and called it a day. However, Scream 3 is no bad film. It's a great ending to a fantastic trilogy, but one thinks that anymore films in this series would become too predictable and familiar.In Scream 3, Kevin Williamson, scrip writer from the first two instalments is absent. Unfortunately the absence is painfully noticeable. The scrip goes too far and tries to reach areas of the storyline that are too deeply rooted in the unfamiliar to be believable after all that has happened in the first two films. The film attempts to complete the circle by rounding it off with this film, yet it can't help but bringing in new facts and stuff like Maureen's ghost that we really didn't need to know. The long and overdrawn explanation of everything that has happened towards the end is not really needed either. You finish watching the film feeling a little disappointed by the lack of action and suspense, but there's certainly one thing that this film has in copious amounts that the first two didn't - blood and guts.Most of the action that goes on in Scream 3 is featured on the Hollywood-style set of Stab 3, the sequel to the original which featured the true-story events of Sidney's events that we saw in the first Scream film. Stab 3 focuses more on Gayle Weather's account of the goings on around the Woodsboro Murders. Having the characters of Stab 3 play the real life characters that we seen on screen is a delightful touch, and adds many humorous moments to the film. As with the first two films we are treated to a fabulous opening sequence that last some ten minutes to get the audience worked and hyped up. With Scream, we saw Drew Barrymore brutally murdered in the opening, while Jada Pinkett was killed off in the cinema in Scream 2 while watching the Hollywood blockbuster Stab. This opening is the worst of the three, but it's still very good and entertaining.Neve Campbell completes her role as Sidney Prescott in Scream 3 with grand style. Her acting peaks here and she shows raw emotion as the traumatised woman. Courtney Cox is fabulous once more as the news reporter Gayle Weathers, but she has lost her snappy edge from the first two instalments that made her the shiniest character in the film. David Arquette has now fully transformed into a very likable character, and is a different man to the geek we saw in the first film. And that's pretty much it as far as main cast stars go. Scream and Scream 2 had many extras and minor role-players, but Scream 3 focuses more on the three main characters who have been in the film since the beginning.",Scream 3
188,emfern13,"A Really Good Movie, But This Can't be the Final Cut",8,23 May 2002,"I also did not get a chance to see this one in the theater either. After Scream 2 i expected this one to be really awesome and to most likely beat the first and almost as good as the second. I was totally wrong it was really good but it was not a good closing to the trilogy. I mean what about Billy's father? His mother was the killer in the second one. There was only one killer it was much better when there was two. Overall, it was really good but there needs to be a fourth.",Scream 3
189,JohnnyPHreak,A Bloody Finale,9,10 July 2000,"Unless you've been locked up deep in heart of Antarctica, then you know about Scream and Scream 2. The two films that regenerated the teen slasher and horror genres. Unfortunately, they also brought with them the copycat slasher films(the 2 I Knows, Urban Legend, H20, Carrie 2). Scream 3 is the finale in the Scream series. In this finale, Sidney is living in a secluded part of California under the name of Laura, a worker for one of those crisis center help lines. In nearby Hollywood, another film about Sid's life is underway, Stab 3(get it!). But when the bodies of the cast begin piling up, Sid, Dewey and Gail are brought back together in order to help out. But once again they become the hunted and are fighting for their lives. What this film has on it's predecessors is comedy. There is much more of it and it comes in the spoof department. In just about every scene the film spoofs it self and does a very good job at that. But this is not a comedy, it's a horror film and does a horror film justice. The body count is large and there are buckets of blood. It has many great jump moments that will make anyone fly out of their seats. Neve, David, and Courteney do thier jobs to the best of their ability but the real surprise is Parker Posey. She is down right hilarious as Jennifer Jolie, the actress who plays Gail in Stab 3. This film has many surprises, cameos and new development for hard-core fans as well as enough to get the newcomers right in to the story. Scream 3 is a great horror film, fantastic spoof, and the perfect ending to the series. If you haven't seen it already, go rent it, it's worth the four bucks.

190,MadBadMovieman,Trilogy Succeeds!,8,5 February 2000,"Part 3 of the Scream Trilogy succeeds.  We were reluctant to go because of the risk of seeing an average or clone sequel but they pulled it off. Enough new characters, plot twists all bringing the past into the present. 
Good pace, good action, not enough blood to make you puke and enough suspense to keep you watching. Who done it is not clear until the last 10 minutes.All characters did there part. Touching at the end knowing what has happened in the lives of 2 main characters. Very good dialogue and exchanges in some scenes. If you liked Scream 1 & 2, you'll enjoy Scream 3.  I hope they don't try it again. Hollywood can always write a script to open up dead stories, characters and events but it would be tough to be credible after 3 successes.  Quit with a winner!",Scream 3
191,jimmyplm,Not as good as the first or second,9,6 February 2000,"I just want to say that overall this was NOT a BAD movie. It just wasn't as good as the first and second Scream movies. I went into the theater expecting to see something as clever and suspenseful as the first two movies, but left feeling a little disappointed. Courtney Cox, Neve Campbell, and David Arquette all returned in this one, but I have to say--who cares about them anymore? The characters are getting old now in the eyes of most movie-watchers. I was hoping that some new characters would be introduced to liven things up a bit, but it was still the same old focus on the same annoying characters (the only one that I still find interesting at all is Gale Weathers). Parker Posey is the real star of this movie; she was the only one in a string of butchered characters that you remotely liked. I enjoyed seeing Jenny McCarthy again also, though she isn't given a starring role by any means. Maybe if the death sequences had been longer and made as suspenseful as those in the first two, then the movie would have been better over all.",Scream 3
192,benjaminwest-242,A better than decent trilogy conclusion,6,27 October 2021,"Scream 3 is a worthwhile addition to the franchise. The acting is good, with new characters developing solid chemistry with the original cast. This assists the respectable emotional depth present throughout the film, for various characters' relationships. The plot is written mostly well, but does falter at times by not exploring certain aspects enough and with some more predictable scenes. Still, the story flows smoothly enough to be truly frightful. Overall, a solid horror film.",Scream 3
193,Cinema_Love,This film is a MLC... Major League Crap!,6,17 January 2006,"They say the third time's a charm. In the case of the Scream movie series, the Wes Craven/Kevin Williamson collaboration credited for having revived the slasher genre in the '90s, this cliché proves to be a falsehood. The most recent (and hopefully final) chapter in the comedy/horror trilogy comes across as a lame regurgitation of material already presented. There are no real surprises, and the whole affair has the feeling of something left too long in the pot to stew. The life and energy is gone. What began as a lively, intelligent series suffused with self-referential humor has turned into just another slice-and-dice-by-numbers affair. Scream 3 isn't just the weakest of the movies, it's the kind of thing that the original Scream lampooned with affectionate glee.All of our old friends are back - even one who didn't survive the second installment - although virtually everyone looks tired of the project. Even director Wes Craven doesn't seem to have his heart in it. (He agreed to direct this movie only after Miramax allowed him to helm the non-horror Music of the Heart.) Neve Campbell's screen time as Sidney Prescott has been dramatically reduced - she hardly appears during the movie's first half, which concentrates on the exploits of Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette). They are in Hollywood, on the set of the movie Stab 3, where members of the cast are being eviscerated in the same order that their characters were offed in the screenplay. The killer leaves behind a picture of Sidney's mother at each crime scene. An LAPD homicide detective named Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) wants to bring in Sidney for questioning, but she's in hiding - until the killer finds her and she decides that seclusion is no longer the answer. So the whole group is united in Tinseltown for another round of mayhem and murder in which just about every supporting character ends up with a knife in his or her back.Scream 3 features three good moments, but they're hardly enough to save the movie from the tedious spiral of repetitiveness it is trapped in. The first is a from-beyond-the-grave video lecture by Randy (Jamie Kennedy), who offers up the ""rules of the trilogy."" For example, ""events in the third segment always go back to the beginning"" and ""even the hero can die in the final chapter."" (One that he doesn't mention, and which proves true in this case, is that the final installment of any trilogy is usually the worst. The examples Randy cites, Star Wars and The Godfather, are classic examples of this.) Then there's a brief cameo by cult heroes Jay and Silent Bob, who are given a couple of lines (well, at least Jay is. Finally, Carrie Fisher appears as a receptionist who bemoans not having gotten the part of Princess Leia in Star Wars because she wouldn't sleep with George Lucas.When it comes to storyline, character development, and pacing, Scream 3 strikes out. The movie drags along from one predictable slaying to the next, and the only real scares along the way are the ""boo!"" moments when something innocuous jumps out of the shadows just before the real killer strikes. Meanwhile, the level of humor in Scream 3 is way down. Parker Posey (as the actress playing Gale in the Stab series) has a few amusing lines, but the ironic dialogue and cute references to other horror films, which were wearing thin in Scream 2, are now positively threadbare.The protagonists - Sidney, Dewey, and Gale - who actually seemed like real people in the other movies, are reduced to cookie cutter impressions of their previous selves. They look the same and sound the same, but there's no depth. And they're always finding new ways to get separated from each other and trapped in dark places. We get a lot of back-story on Sidney and her mother, but it's all pretty pointless. And, for those who like to play the killer guessing game, there isn't any purpose. Despite numerous red herrings, there's no way to logically deduce the culprit's identity. Once the unmasking occurs, the story is forced to go through a number of improbable gyrations to make things sound vaguely plausible. But, by then, I had lost interest. I was beginning to wish the masked murderer would dispatch everyone who was still alive, including herself/himself, so that the movie could end.Once, I wrote that Scream 3 would have to do something radical or inventive to avoid becoming tiresome. Unfortunately, there's nothing here that even the most inexperienced horror film fan would call innovative, and the predictable result is a movie that pales in comparison with its predecessors. Thus far, 2000 has been a very bad year for films, and Scream 3 does nothing to reverse the trend.",Scream 3

195,segacs,They should have stopped after two,2,5 February 2005,"Okay, so it's been a while since this one was in the theatre. But back then I didn't think it was worth paying eight bucks to go see, and now that I've seen it on the dish, my opinion has been reaffirmed.Scream was once one of the better thriller-type movies, deriving originality from using the rules in order to break them. This made it at least slightly more innovative than the standard slasher flick. The first time, anyway. Even the second one was liveable.The third Scream, though, the so-called finale of the trilogy, was just plain terrible. There's no way around it. Firstly, it wasn't even remotely scary. And this is a supposed scary movie. I didn't even jump once. Secondly, it began with the making of a movie to imitate the Woodsboro murders. Um, hel-lo, that's exactly how the second one began.It's a shame they killed off Randy in the second movie, because he was sorely missed. Even the writers realized this because they brought him back for a ""video from beyond the grave"" cameo. Can you say lame? The worst part was, his scene was one of the best parts of the movie.Another highlight was a two-second cameo by Jay and Silent Bob, but only people familiar with Kevin Smith caught that. The rest was typical: Neve Campbell scared, Courtney Cox bitchy, David Arquette fumbling around while everyone around him is getting killed.The plot attempted unsuccessfully to delve into the past to bring up skeletons from the closet. But they weren't even innovative skeletons. So Mommy was an actress in the past. Big deal. In trying so hard to add plot twists, the writers of Scream 3 made a cardinal mistake: bending the facts to fit the story.In short, that's what's wrong with Scream 3: they ran out of originality. They really should have stopped after two.",Scream 3

Scream 3 is suppose to be the chilling third chapter, of the phenomenon, frightful, and popular Scream movies. However, it lacks what made the first and second Scream movies amazing.I believe the 3rd entry could have used it's old screenwriter back, Kevin Williamson (I Know What You Did last Summer, The Faculty). Instead, we get a new screenwriter, Ehren Kruger (The Ring, Transformer: Age of Extinction). In my opinion, Kevin Williamson may be the better writer.I believe this Scream film didn't have the heart behind it. Easy it enjoyable? Sure. Is it a classic like the first one, or even good like the second? Not really.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Scream 3. It's not as suspenseful, original, and clever as the rest.

197,Xophianic,A great end to a great movie trilogy,9,6 February 2000,"I was very excited about seeing SCREAM 3. The main reason was that this was the first of the SCREAM movies that I did not know who the killer was before seeing it. I also knew that it was possible this time that the three main characters, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) could die. So I didn't know what to expect, and my expectations might have been higher for SCREAM 3 than the others. After all, this is supposed to be the grand finale, as advertised. I was not disappointed.Stab 3, the movie series based on the stories that happened in the last two SCREAM movies, is only days away from opening. But then the murders start again. Sidney Prescott, who has gone into hiding, is discovered by the killer. She goes to find Dewey for protection. Gale Weathers also returns when she learns of what is going on. Cast members of the Stab 3 movie start to get killed as the killer, straight out of Sidney's past, closes in on Sidney for the grand finale.I thought this story line was better than in SCREAM 2 because it was not too similar to that of SCREAM, which SCREAM 2 was. This movie really had the grand finale feel (and I know all about how Kevin Williamson didn't return for SCREAM 3, so if they do make a Scream 4, I don't think it will work) and, although the plot was similar, it seemed to be more of it's own movie than SCREAM 2 was.The acting was just as good as in SCREAM and SCREAM 2. Cambell, Arquette and Cox did their usual good jobs. The small part that SCREAM 2's victim Randy Meeks, played by Jamie Kennedy, did on video was priceless. It was one of my favorite parts of the movie, if not my absolute favorite. Scott Foley did an excellent job. The cameo-like parts done by Lance Henriksen and Carrie Fisher were cool and Liev Schreiber did an OK job for the small part he had. And of course, Roger L. Jackson did great as the phone voice.I was praying throughout the movie that Sidney, Dewey and Gale would survive. I am sure (and I certainly hope) that this is the final SCREAM movie, and I really hope that the three of them survived, even though Randy said it was possible that they could die. Obviously, the character development that was done to them throughout the SCREAM trilogy was well-done.I hope that there are no more SCREAM movies, because it really did end on a high-note. I also hope that the SCREAM trilogy will be remembered as one of the greats, along with the STAR WARS trilogy and the GODFATHER trilogy, because it certainly deserves it. Go see SCREAM 3 in theaters now, you'll love it.",Scream 3
198,flickjunkie-3,Endlessly Loveable.,8,13 November 2000,"Scream 3 is apparently the final cut, the end of the marvellous Scream trilogy. Although it is not as accomplished as either of its predecessors, Scream 3 is still an adorable, memorable and entertaining addition to the series.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has literally disappeared off the face of the Earth - hiding from the world and the whole haunted, bloodstained legacy that is Woodsboro. But that's all about to change. A new slasher flick based on Sidney's horrific story is being shot in LA, called `Stab 3'. And one by one, the cast of `Stab 3'are taking their final curtain call. Someone is mimicking the horrific murders of the first two Scream films, only this time, even the leads are dying. So the real Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette), Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and Sidney Prescott must step into the spotlight to flush the killer out. And that means going back to Woodsboro one last terrifying time.The cast all seem to enjoy themselves lots, the new additions are Patrick Dempsey who is convincingly hilarious, Scott Foley who is near-perfect, Jenny McCarthy who is funny and enjoyable, and newcomer Parker Posey is outstanding. Her performance is witty and watchable. But, it is still the oldies that bring the screen alive. Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette have a marvellous on-screen chemistry and their performances are excellent. But, it is Neve Campbell, once again; who ignites the screen the most. Her 3rd leading role as Sidney in the series is brilliant; her acting is absolute perfection, to say the least! Ehren Kruger, the writer has lots of comic talent. His script is clever and imaginative, and his flaws aren't noticeable.Scream 3 is a loveable instalment to the classic series; it is well worth a look for fans of the first two films.I rate Scream 3 8 out of 10.",Scream 3

The jokes are funny, the cameos are great, and this movie actually had some of the creepy remnants of Craven's Nightmare on Elm Street.  Kudos to Wes Craven for not letting Kevin Williamson continue his fall (Teaching Mrs. Tingle, Halloween H20).

It starts off good and goes downhill very quicklyIt starts off at Sidneys hideaway and she gets phonecall from her 'dead' mother and then she and most of the characters from scream 1 and 2 get killed off eventually.

204,GluStick,"Well, I liked it but I ended up feeling a bit cheated.",9,13 March 2000,"Boy, it's been a while since I wrote a review for ANY movie. Feels good to write something. This movie, though, really made me want to write something. I saw this movie more than a month ago, now that I think about it. Anyway, I'll just cut to the chase. There will be some spoilers and I will reveal who the killer(s) so read with caution or don't read until you have seen the movie. I guess I can start with the plot. More of the same, with Sidney being stalked once again by a messed up psycho. I was sad to find out that she plays a small role in this. She was the main character in the first two but now she is just alone and isolated. Well, who could blame her after all that's happened to her? She lives in a house deep in the woods. She still talks to friends and family but keeps a low profile. She works for a crisis hotline. Good job, I guess. Well, killings start to happen on the set of Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro and Sidney gets thrown into the mix by a nosey detective played by Patrick Dempsey. Call me corny, but I actually liked the idea of bringing in an old 80's teen star. He did a good job and really confused me about him being the killer. I just suspected him all the way but was surprised when he turned out to be a good guy. Dewey and Gale have drifted apart and don't really like each other as much as they used to but still have a thing for each other. Dewey is working on the set of Stab 3 and is no longer a police deputy. Gale is not really a news reporter but sort of a talkshow host-type person. Killings mostly happen to the cast of Stab 3 and people who have something to do with the movie. I thought it was really scary and made me jump a lot of times. I thought it was funny but didn't have the edge Kevin Williamson gave it and I miss him in this one. Well, Sidney shows up for the climax which, I must say, was good but didn't live up to my expectations for the third and, supposedly, last chapter in the trilogy. The killer turns out to be her long, lost brother but he is known through the movie as the director of Stab 3, Roman Bridger. I found that to be a little odd. He wasn't much older than Sidney but said that he was sort of kicked out of the house and some how Sidney didn't even know she had a brother. Like her parents wouldn't have told her she had a brother who was born around the same time as her?!? I really wish there would've been two killers, though. Well, it was a nice twist but all that stuff about 'all bets off' was just to get people excited because they thought Sidney might actually die. She lives and I'm glad she did but it might have been good to step up all the hype by just killing Gale or Dewey or even both. It is pretty violent, though. It was way more bloody than the first two.  I still liked it but was expecting a bit more from the greatest horror series ever made. It was very thrilling and had lots of action, laughs, and, of course, screams and I liked the script but I think it would've been better if it had been written by Kevin Williamson. He made the horror genre better with this trilogy. Speaking of trilogies, I didn't really like the fact that the door was left open for another sequel. I thought they said it was the last, didn't they? Oh well, as long as the fourth is good, go ahead and make it but if it sucks, it just goes to show you, Hollywood will do anything for a buck.

205,mercury-26,Neither scary nor funny,1,8 July 2000,"The best scene in any one of the ""Scream"" films was the opening scene of the first film-the now classic phone call' scene in which Drew Barrymore is cut in half. It was true horror, a tribute to those that came before, as scary and gory as the best of them. It was the kind of adrenaline rush good enough for any horror fan. The rest of the film was more funny than scary, as everything else seemed to play comedically off of it. Still, horror fans loved it.I didn't even remember the story enough to follow along with the connections to the next two installments of the series. I enjoyed ""Scream 2"" anyway. The opening scene, set in the movie theater, was almost as great as the original's. Not all that scary, but clearly they were pulling out all the stops to create something fresh. Another memorable scene in ""2"" was the one in which Sidney and her friend are trapped in the back seat of a police car, the only way out being to climb over the unconscious killer sitting in the front seat. As white-knuckle as they come. A short time later, however, comes the completely disappointing ending, the kind that leaves the audience wanting, priming it for one more installment, just so the series can redeem itself.Not that anyone was worried there wouldn't be a third film: even as the second was being released, they were already shooting number three. This time Kevin Williamson decided to watch from the sidelines and passed writing duties to Ehren Kruger. Kruger is a good writer. He even gets the Scream formula right (if there is such a thing). What he doesn't do is write a scary movie. Not even the usually dependable Wes Craven's direction could make it scary (he's gone soft officially, starting with last year's ""Music of the Heart""). When the opening scene with Cotton Weary and his girlfriend comes and goes with nary a tense moment and barely a drop of blood, the film has already made it clear that its creators are going to let the more squeamish off the hook this time. We have now entered the realm of 'Horror Lite' or 'Horror for Wimps' or, more specifically, Horror designed to draw the widest audience possible.The first two films, along with having genuinely scary moments, were also funny. ""Scream 3"" is not. Kruger was probably selected for his ability to write twisty plots. When it comes to the dialogue, however, Williamson is missed. Kruger's other recent effort, ""Reindeer Games,"" had some humorous moments, but witty youthful banter is not his specialty. Maybe this is a good thing.This was supposed to be the fitting grand finale to a proud series. Instead, it becomes the one that beats its own conventions to death. It makes you realize how tired and repetitive the whole man-with-knife-chasing-young-beautiful-girl thing has become. Yes, this means that the ""Scream"" trilogy managed to both revive and re-kill the teen slasher genre. Of course, the genre is like any good horror movie villain: no matter how many times you kill it, it keeps coming back. Maybe next time they'll think to blow it into bits instead of just shooting it in the head.Grade: D-",Scream 3

Also there are cool cameos by Liev Schrieber, Jamie Kennedy, and Jay and Silent Bob!9/10!!",Scream 3
207,Rinho18,My number 132 movie,8,6 February 2001,"Scream 3 is my number 132 movie. I think it is worse than part 1 and better than part 2. What I did not like about Scream 3 was that all the women scream almost through the whole movie. What is so frightening about a light that is switched off if there are three people standing next to you ?
Sidney Prescott ( Neve Campbell ) has left Woodsboro and went to Los Angeles. She is a clergyman for women in trouble. One day she hears that Cotton Werry, the man that she accused for murdering her mother, but who was actually innocent, and his girlfriend are murdered. A few days later another actor is killed, and people notice that the actors are killed exactly in the same order that their characters die in ´Stab3´ ( the film dealing with the incidents of ´Scream1&2´). But there are four different versions of a script... And none knows how´s gonna be the next...I think that Scream 3 is a good horror film. The first time I really loved it ( in the cinema ), but the second time I watched it on video ( and in English ), I noticed that it was not as good as I had thought. What I totally dislike about all of the Scream-movies ( don´t get me wrong, I like all of them ) is that the murderer/s just take/s off his/their mask/s by the end, although they/he want/s to be unidentified. That is not clever is it ?!? And as in all Scream-movies, the killer/s make a sensation of killing Sidney. All the other characters are killed in less than 5 seconds, but they/he always let Sidney run away. That is quite stupid.All in all, I rated this movie 8/10  ( as Scream 2 ), but I think it is better than Scream 2, because the ending is definitely not as bad as in Scream 2. The ending of Scream 2 was very boring, but this one was quite original.I recommend this film to fans of  Scream 1&2, but you should not expect a film that is as GREAT as Scream1, because Scream 3 definitely is not. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.",Scream 3
208,spikelovesbuffy2002,Pretty good,7,30 June 2002,"I liked this one but it wasn't as good as the original. The storyline was pretty weak in this movie, i really liked the Cameo by JAMIE KENNEDY in this movie expalining ""the rules"". Well its good that this is the end of it i dont think they will make a scream 4 i think its finnaly over, overall its a pretty good movie i give it a 7/10!",Scream 3

210,MissCzarChasm,Welcome to the Final Act!,8,20 March 2000,"What a way to end the most entertaining trilogy out there. at first i was worried that they might mess up the final film. i was worried that maybe it won't be as good as the first but i was totally wrong. in fact it turned out to be the best one out of all of them. It may not be the scariest installment but it is the most thought provoking and it will having you guessing until the very good conclusion. it does what every final film in a series should do. Ties up all the loose ends and answers all the questions that might have come up in the first 2 films.The story begins in hollywood where they are filming the final installment in the Stab trilogy called Stab 3 Return to Woodsborro. when someone involved in the film is murdered( it happens in a very intense opening scene) the stab set becomes a FBI headquarters. pretty soom we are re-introduced to some familiar faces. Sydney is in hiding under a new name and working as a crisis counselor. all is not well with sydney. the vents of the first 2 films have truly tramutized her and she is at her wits end. she's in hiding because according to her ""Psychos can't kill what they can't find"". Back in Hollywood Dewey is working as a consultant on the Stab set and gale Weathers is a reporter for total Entertainment who is summoned to help with the case. Pretty soon Sydney comes out of hiding and now the fianl Act can get into full gear.The acting was good from all of its stars. Neve Campbell has made sydney her own and in this film and it truly shows in this film. in fact she made sydney a strong character who everyone can admire. Courtney Cox is good at playing gale in fact she's my fave character and david arquette is really good at playing dewey. in fact i don't think anyone can play him like he could.The new characters are a mixed bag(since most of them were just there to be killed) Parker posey is very good as the actress playing Gale weathers in stab.she was so funny and a very good in the role. Scott Foley is also good as the director who's cast is being killed by a violent killer. The rest of the cast are just there for a few scenes but they serve there purpose and do well with what they are given.I loved the film in fact it was great. so now i will remember this trilogy for making me scared, making me laugh and most of all making me scream. A",Scream 3
211,alandeza,It was alright,7,21 October 2021,"I loved the first two movies and this one didn't live up to the hype, but it wasn't that bad. The primary trio did a great job as always, and even though she had a nice resolution in the end, it sucks that Neve was barely in this movie because of scheduling conflicts. My only real gripe was that the new characters were pretty dumb and I had no real connection with them. Still recommend it to fans of the series.",Scream 3
212,Speechless,As good as anyone would have expected,6,4 February 2000,"Personally, I'd be very happy if horror filmmakers permanently retired the ""fake scare""-- those dumb little moments when there's a big stab of high-pitched music and one of the normal characters pops up out of nowhere, and we're supposed to be fooled into thinking the killer is there.  The makers of Scream 3 are obviously aware of how idiotic and contrived it feels whenever this happens in a movie, but they don't mind doing it to us fifteen or sixteen times within the movie's hour-and-a-half timespan.  And it's that kind of stuff that keeps this film from being a worthwhile experience; the movie is too busy parodying the horror genre's conventions (and bashing us over the head with them) to be even remotely scary.  They've fallen into the same rut that the original Scream protested against-- the point where horror movies become just rehashes, staying within the guidelines set by an earlier, genuinely scary film.  That's what happened with Halloween and that's what's happening with Scream now.  It's like they're not even trying to scare us anymore.  They just want to see how many times they can ""surprise"" us by having some character pick up the phone and talk to someone else who turns out to be the killer speaking through one of those little voice-changing machines.  It's entertaining enough, but you leave the theater with a definite feeling that these guys are guilty of the exact same offenses they want to protest.",Scream 3
213,mbworm,Different from the first two,7,1 September 2005,"""Scream 3"" is by no means a bad film. It just can't live up to the first two as much as you want it to. ""Scream"" was unpredictable, tense, original and interesting. ""Scream 2"" toned it down and had some very memorable scares, carrying the plot on well. ""Scream 3"" is the big conclusion, and overall, it works on a lot of levels, just not like the first movie.""Scream 2"" seemed too much like a middle. There had to be an end, it just didn't stop there. Although technically it had more of its own storyline, the films were still intertwined, which brings us to chapter three, where we're now in Hollywood.Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette are all back once again, though it's sad to say that they all seem ready to finish, without the effort they put into the first two installments. It really is time for ""Scream"" to be finished or else the first film will be put to shame, so Wes Craven returns to the director's seat and does everything he can to end the series with a bang. The goriest, most mysterious and most intricate film ensues.On the set of ""Stab 3"" (the movie within the movie that chronicle's the events of Sydney's life), the young, hip actors that are homages to the first film are dying off, brutally murdered one by one. The ghost face killer is back and meaner than ever but we actually see less of him here. The story is more focused on the backstory of Scream part one, where Sydney's mother turns out to have a dirty past and Sydney and the gang have to dig deeper into it. The deaths and chase scenes are all well choreographed and entertaining, especially when Sydney confronts the killer for the first time again. But towards the end Wes Craven begins to lose the story. It becomes sloppy and poorly edited, and the conclusion is the weakest in the series Still, what could you hope for? Screenwriter Ehren Kruger crafts too much of a story but it works as the end to a clever series. There's enough scares and humor to stay true. It's a good effort but it's all just so conventional by now. Cool DVD with lots of extra features that goes well with the collection, and look for the funny cameo by Jennifer McCarthy.**1/2 out of ****",Scream 3
214,Chris-332,Much Better Than I Expected!,1,5 February 2000,"Through the first two Scream movies we've been exposed to many laughs, many screams, many thrills, and (sadly) a couple problems. I must admit, when I found out that Kevin Williamson would not be writing the third and final movie in the surprisingly good Scream series. I actually had very low expectations for Scream 3, mostly because I did not like Arlington Road, the movie Ehren Kruger (writer of Scream 3) wrote before this one. When I saw the movie, I was very pleasantly surprised. Sure, it had some bad acting, the beginning was sort of cheesy, and there were tons of pointless characters. But still, the movie shined very bright in both the comedy and horror elements of the script. The movie was both the funniest Scream movie as well as the scariest. I was laughing almost to tears in parts of the movie, and in all the other parts I was jumping in my seat. The movie had so many more scares in it than the first two. Scream 2 was not scary at all, and Scream had some scares, but it still doesn't hold a margin to the many, many scares in the third one. The story had some plot holes, but so did Scream 2 and even the first one. It also had some very clever and extremely fun and funny scenes. Randy's special appearance was a classic element in the movie. The characters in the movie were pretty normal and average. That's one thing Ehren Kruger didn't have, Kevin Williamson's lush and excellent characters. But still, it didn't matter one bit, because this Scream, as the others, has one goal: to entertain and thrill the audience. The killer(s) of the movie was unpredictable and unexpected, but not to the point of ridicule, as the second one did. That one element of the movie was one of two things. It was cheesy, but it also worked very well. I was pleasantly surprised. So all in all, Scream 3 is arguably the best, and worst, of the Scream series. It was definitely the scariest, and funniest, of the trilogy, but it also had the weakest plotline and characters. I personally think it was worse than the first, but better than the second. Either way, though, it was defintely a worthwhile and enjoyable ending to a great series.",Scream 3
215,badgirl9,Good but what genre is this?,6,12 July 2001,At least it's better than Scream 2! I enjoyed the final chapter of the ever popular Scream series but I noticed one major thing: where are the spoofs and references? It took another turn and tried to be serious. I enjoyed reunting with the old characters and meeting a fresh new group of them. It was great to see Randy again as it broke my heart when he died in Scream 2. This is a great end to the great trilogy.,Scream 3
216,Ricardo-36,"Scream 3? Oh no, not again!",2,2 July 2000,"*SPOILER (ONLY IF YOU NEVER SAW A MOVIE IN YOUR LIFE)*     What is wrong with you people? Am I the only one that admits that those ""teenage-mysterious-murder-movies"" really sucks? I mean, c'mon! All these movies use that stupid ""scary"" trick, like someone opening a door very fast, or coming from behind, and making the audience jump from the chair... Or the murder, that seems to be very dead, jumping in the last moment from the floor with a knife in his hand... I don't know if it is going to be filmed a Scream 4, and I don't really care. I am not that stupid to see it...",Scream 3
217,Sharkey360,The best since the original! (Some spoilers),10,1 July 2000,"I appreciate the entire Scream Trilogy. The first was an instant classic, the sequel was a few steps below the original (still very good and has strong intrigue), while the third chapter excels over Scream 2. Scream 3 has a more reunion feel to it and it has more art. Wes Craven and new Scream-scribe Ehren Kruger added some Hollywood feel to the trilogy, way over the Stab concept of the sequel. We get to see real movie sets of Woodsboro, which was needed because the story does not set there anymore...both Craven and Kruger knew that fans would miss home. Heck, the Stab 3 Woodsboro really gave that home feel! Kruger's script really surprised me as each character has deep emotion, intrigue, humanity and pain. I thought that Kevin Williamson's absence would ruin Scream 3, but Kruger's presence filled the hole. Sometimes I felt Kruger toyed with Williamson idea, like seeing the Stab 3 production and the actors...but then again there's no better way to see the Scream cast ""return"" to Woodsboro when the film no longer sets there. Kruger's Hollywood concept is fresh and welcome! I also liked Kruger's addition of that Randy video, which connects this film to Scream 2 very well...plus some movie talk.Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox-Arquette are back. This time Neve's Sidney has lesser spotlight, but the final encounter made up for it. Sidney's maturity is bearly noticed due to the cut of screen time, however she lacks some shock in relating to the truth of the final encounter. It was also new to see Sidney having those shocking visions of her mom, whom you'll learn alot about. David's Dewey has obviously healed the past few years now that he can move better, but it's kinda hard to swallow seeing him with another ""Gale"" (when everyone thought he and Gale are it) and being a filmmaker. Courtney as Gale Weather has a new job...not as a media woman but more as an investigator. I know it's a far jump from the last two films, but I do admit getting tired of her ""journalist breaks rules to get great story"" personality. Eventually, Gale and Dewey get together again.The mastermind behind the killings actually fits into the series pretty smoothly. Seeing the mastermind talk about life, jealousy and leading real events justified the link and the killing spree. Obviously the mastermind grew up with loose morals and a trouble life...but has great reasons to target Sidney.For the directing, Craven's work is once again artistic. One of the parts that I liked best was when Sidney entered the set of Stab 3 and got shocked on how accurate and ""homey"" the set of her home and Woodsboro was...like she was back home. It made me want to see Scream again! Craven's got a lot of killing in the film, although my complaint was that the final conflict lacked intrigue and the musical score was toned down. The ""everyone's a suspect"" concept is here again, and the unveiling of the mastermind is very surprising as well.Like Scream 2, Scream 3 has its shares of movie references. John Milton, the name of Al Pacino's devil in ""The Devil's Advocate"" as well as the name of the poet who wrote ""Paradise Lost"", is the producer of horror movies including Stab 3. Regarding Sidney's mom and the past, he's very guilty of what happened though you won't see it. Star Wars and other movies were mentioned as well. The cameo appearances are cool, most especially Carrie Fisher whom you just have to see and listen for the name ""Lucas"".
Overall, Scream 3 is the best film since the original. It does have some flaws but they're ignorable. Scream 3 is as unforgettable as the first as well, and it's got some fresh concepts thanks to Kruger (who did a great job) and Craven (who added a little comedy here). Close to the original and steps above Scream 2. Watch this movie!",Scream 3

219,timefreezer7,Decent epilogue to the trilogy,8,21 April 2003,"I really cannot understand all these negative comments . Not only Scream 3 is quite good but it is the most decent finale that could ever be made for the Scream history . Why is it that you must always rush in to agree with the official critics and lambast the movies they want to bury ? What is so wrong with Battlefield Earth (IMDb rating 2.3) ? It is a decent enjoyable sci-fi movie . Yeah it is campy . So was the 5th Element (rating 7.0) . I like them both equally . What was so wrong about Batman and Robin despite the dumb one-liners ? Nothing not only the cast was wisely chosen but the action scenes were wonderfully chosen , sets , costume and make up were magnificent and save the Batgirl character , the origin of the others was kept intact . And don't even get me started about the butchering of the wonderful Speed II (rating 3.3 !!!!) . For God 's sake it is a big budget action rollercoaster with good SFX . OK OK , Dafoe and Patrick are more lackluster than their predecessors and the finale was over the top . Well so were all the action scenes in True Lies or even the Matrix !!!! Why must you always follow the dictates of the official critics . Why the praise should go to awful overrated films like Mission Impossible or Sixth Sense (rating 8.3 ?!?!?! COME OOOOON !) . Enough with the manifest . If you agree with me even partially then read this review . Scream 3 is an underrated film . It has some flaws but some of the critics were right . It is better than Scream 2 although not better than the original . This was to be anticipated . They had 3 years to plan it while Scream 2 was rushed into production shortly after the release of the original and was released less than one year later. The result was a carbon copy of Scream (albeit enjoyable one) . Did you know that in the original script of Williamson , the killer was Derek ? This time they had more time for process . I believe it was for the benefit of the film that the script was written by someone else , based on a format by Williamson . This gave the chance for our characters to evolve . Keep in mind that when I watched Scream 3 I already knew : 1) The identity of the killer 2) The motives of the killer 3) What happens in the opening sequence 4) The special trick the killer uses this time (I don 't want to give it away) 5) Jamie Kennedy 's post mortem appearance 6) The visions with Maureen Prescott 7) Who lives and who dies by the end . Still the movie surprised me , kept me hooked and satisfied me . That alone says enough .
OK PLOT SYNOPSIS TIME :  It has been several years after the events of Scream 2 . Do not be fooled by the quote `I met Maureen Prescott 4 years ago' . If this was accurate then the time lapse between Scream 2 and 3 would be only 1 year . Sidney wouldn 't even have the time to graduate from college . `Stab 2' has already been released but the acceptance was mediocre. The basic cast was reluctant to return for yet another sequel but the producers went on to make a `Stab 3' , a semi-fictional movie based on the real living characters set in Woodsboro , in order to answer some questions about what eventually happened in the tragic bloodbath of 1996 . Meanwhile lets see what happened to the survivors . Sidney (Neve Campbell) has graduated from Windsor . She and her father live somewhere in the boonies . Sidney is convinced that she is still in jeopardy , so she has disappeared from the face of the earth . She works as `Laura' , a social advisor of a radio station , taking phone lines in her home and answers to people with various problems (abusing boyfriends etc) . She is tortured by visions of her deceased mother and believes the nightmare will never be over . There may be someone who still wants to kill her . Much like Laurie Strode in H20 her phobias will proven soon to be true . Gail Weathers (Courteney Cox) has changed the name of her show and still struggles to take the Pulitzer Prize. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) has now his own talk show dealing again with social issues . His fame gave him success , celebrity , star power and he has a beautiful girlfriend Christine (Kelly Rutherford) . Dewey Riley (David Arquette) now works at the set of Stab 3 , as a technical advisor since he lived the experience himself . He has an affair with Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey) , the actress who has played Gail Weathers in all 3 films . During the shooting of Stab 3 a new chain of murders occurs . The Ghostface killer strikes again and he kills the actors of Stab 3 , in precisely the same order their characters die in the script . Gail for once more arrives at the crime scene and teams up with Dewey in order to find the killer . The investigator of the case detectice Kinkaid , played by Patrick Dempsey is convinced that Sidney is the key to the solution and wants her to get out of her hide . The killer leaves pictures of Maureen after every killing and has obviously an unspecified link with the first carnage in Woodsboro . It is difficult however to find who will be the next to die , since the producers have come up with 3 different versions of the script in order to keep the plot from leaking to the Internet (something which happened in real life with Scream 2 and Scream 3 : another self referential irony by the writers). After the murders the producer John Milton (Lance Henricksen) has no other option but to cancel the filming , at least temporarily , while the police has sealed the set as a crime scene . The young and ambitious director Roman (Scott Foley) is losing his mind since this is the final strike in his newborn career . Predictably more murders will take place and the leads will try to save their lives as well as trying to shed some light in Maureen 's secret past .Well the secondary characters serve no other purpose but to be killed . The only one which stands up from the crew is Parker Posey . Her disputes with Cox about who is the better Gail Weathers are hilarious and deliver some super bitchiness to the screen . Posey gives a great appearance. Unfortunately the rest are underdeveloped or even annoying (like the actress who plays `Sidney' in Stab 3) . This is a great minus . Fortunately , the writer Ehren Krueger makes up for some of the predictability of the script (especially in the final scenes) with some ironic lines 'Don't worry , we 're going to stick together' `Don't split up in this huge mansion' `Black characters never survive horror movies' . These people , as well as we the viewers , truly believe that these things happen only in horror films and we are not in danger . A classic example is the fax scene where a panicked character does the stupidest thing he could , due to his fear . Secondly there are a few plot holes : Most of the leads had cellular phones , why didn't they call the police ? Moreover , since the set is sealed and when a deranged killer is on the loose why do the actors of Stab 3 keep hanging around there , since they know they are in great jeopardy as the next targeted victims ? Did they want to `pick up their stuff' ? Sad excuse !!! I would also like to point out a factual error : the killer is shot REPEATEDLY and survives due to a bullet-proof vest he wears (don't consider this a spoiler : it will make you understand better what happened) . The truth is that this kind of collar can take just a few bullets but it is NOT A PANACEA and it is possible you will be injured and even with serious marks. Most probably if you take a bullet even with a vest you lose your conscience let alone six or seven bullets . I guess this is an ultra enforced and enhanced model hah ? It doesn't matter anyway . I can always accept a couple of plot holes . An important error by the writer is the déjà vu experience Sidney has in her `house' . I understand the point was a reliving of the fear but did we really have to endure a carbon copy of the original ? You should have at least shortened it Mr Craven . The visions with Maureen should be directed better with more haunting atmosphere.These were the only faults I can give the film . All the other points are positive . Krueger did a wonderful job with our familiar characters . They have aged , but they have aged well and are not at all tired . Their chemistry is better than ever . I never liked Dewey but I rooted for him here . Arquette fortunately abandoned his `Doofus' mannerisms and retarded way of speaking . He is reliable and works as a serious protector . He and Cox give wonderful performances and their interaction is great . Campbell is now a grown woman and not a frightened student . She decides to come in terms with her fate and finally becomes an active character (again a similarity with H20 : no more pathetic screaming victims who run) . The screen time between the 3 leads is equal and this helps the movie not to be boring . All of them search for clues and keep the suspense. Parker Posey is also very good as Jennifer and Patrick Dempsey does fine in a non-geeky role . I am a great fan of Lance Henricksen and Liev Schreiber and they do not disappoint here as well . They shine in their small but effective roles . Kelly Rutherford is also welcomed here . Jamie Kennedy returns shortly as Randy and is cute but the best cameo is by Carrie Fischer in a surprise appearance . Despite the predictable victims the murder sequences are still effective and offer some surprises . The only problem is that Ghost-face is as not as scary as he was . Even Roger Jackson 's sinister telephone Voice isn't  as menacing as it used to be . This was to be expected : after 2 movies Craven realized that the audience cannot be scared anymore . Therefore he did his best to make up . The psychological horror backsteps here but the interest is kept through the action scenes . This is the most action-packed of the Scream movies (and a horror movie generally speaking) . There are not only the routine chase scenes . The victims fight valiantly and there is a lot of bang-bang as well . From the opening sequence to the final hero-versus-villain showdown there are enough physical fights to keep you hooked . Craven is in top form and I don't give a damn about idiot libels .I once said that Scream didn't need continuation chapters (read my comments on the first two movies if you 'd like) . I have changed my mind now . The revelations about Maureen and the re-attachment to the events of the first Scream make the movie worthwhile . The characters have matured and the film gives them and the story a perfect sense of closure . Ironically Arquette and Cox followed their characters' storylines ever since they met on the set of Scream . Life imitating art ? If you are a Scream completist do not hesitate for a second . Rent the final act and see the saga conclude (like the Star Wars trilogy) . Scream 3 is an enjoyable action / horror film which FINALLY does justice to its origins and will satisfy even the ones who were disappointed with the second part . I would also like to see some day a `Director 's Cut' with the rumoured 2 alternative endings. As it is , which is the final grade of the film ?8 / 10",Scream 3
220,sam_aj_01,Loved it but got trashy...,7,26 December 2008,"Scream was an original classic, contradicting all the cliché events in horror films throughout the years. Then came the pointless second that mentions the rules to sequel movies. Finally the third, but this was actually worth watching and beats the second by miles! When Stab 3 is in production, writer Gale Weathers is back and bitchier than ever ready to start on book number two of the Woodsboro murders, however the killer returns too in a attempt to confront Sidney and kill her.The first half of this film is great, but the second half ruins it completely. I would still say this is worth watching, its one of those sequels we've always waited for with a different and better story altogether.",Scream 3
221,Sam_Gray,worthy - an equal to the first two,8,5 February 2000,"Not surprisingly, this film feels a lot like the first two (even with new screenwriter Ehren Kruger), but I found that I really didn't care.  Sure, it's full of one-dimensional characters that only serve to raise the body count.  Granted, it feels a little contrived and slightly far-fetched.  But, whatever.  Scream 3 is, like the first two installments, fun and entertaining almost despite itself.  It's both suspenseful enough to keep a viewer interested and smart enough not to take itself too seriously.Also, although the film suffers from the relative lack of Jamie Kennedy (he has a ""special appearance""), the killer is less predictable than in Scream 2.  But, like Scream 2, the ending seems a little weak, though it manages to get the job done.So, here's the basic litmus test if you don't know if you want to see Scream 3.  If you liked the first two - at all - then you'll probably enjoy this. If you didn't like the first two, avoid this movie.  Personally, I give this movie, and all the Screams, an 8/10.",Scream 3
222,Roddy-15,Great movie!,5,1 March 2000,"I have noticed some people didn't like Scream III. It seems people's opinions are divided on this one. This film has it all. It is funny, scary, and it has action. Unlike the previous two, however, it is not a parody of horror films. That's probably one of the reasons why some people haven't enjoyed it. Bottom line: a little different than the previous two. Scarier but less funny. Once again you will find yourself wondering who the killer is. I will help you: the killer is... Go watch the movie, I won't tell you.",Scream 3
223,blade-21,Now Complete,6,30 April 2000,"I didn't find the film too bad considering the poor reviews given to it by many critics. Having said that however, the series has now clearly run its course and it's time to move on.The plot, such as it is, has become predictable and cliched. If Sidney Prescott was an ""real life"" person I would run a mile rather than be aquainted with her or I'd probably end up dead somewhere!! ( It's a little like getting on a plane only to find that Joe Petroni is a fellow passenger or is in the employ of the airline. You are assured of a scary flight!)Overall then I would say that Scream 3 is predictable but just about watchable. If there is a temptation to make a Scream 4 however, forget it, there's no more mileage!!",Scream 3

225,sloopydrew,"Lame, lousy, mediocre, irritating, annoying, and inadequate",1,23 June 2000,"Calling Scream 3 disappointing, as so many critics and fans of the series already have, wouldn't begin to describe it.  Try deplorable, disheartening, unsatisfactory, ineffective, uninteresting, second-rate, inferior, lame, lousy, mediocre, irritating, annoying, and inadequate, and you might get an idea as to what a rotten little afterthought of a sequel this movie actually is.Instead of ending the series with a refreshing bang, new screenwriter Erin Kruger mimics original ""Scream"" scribe, Kevin Williamson's every move, and winds up making Scream 3 seem like nothing more than a faded Xerox of something that wasn't all that wonderful to begin with.  It is ironic that, by not following the ""all bets are off"" rule that Kruger himself concocted, this film is going to end up making far less money than it would have, if it didn't choose to play it safe.  In the end, it isn't the audience that will be scared by Scream 3 . . . it's the investors.",Scream 3
226,unbend_5440,Wanna know who the killer is?,1,25 July 2001,"The killer in Scream 3 is.............. WES CRAVEN! Because he probably killed the careers of every actor in this movie. The first Scream was pretty decent, the second was disappointing, but not all bad, and Scream 3 is just plain DULL! There's nothing left in this franchise to hold my interest. You'd think since the first Scream was fairly original and innovative, that there'd be something new and fresh in Scream 3. But it's all the same boring scenes and killings that were in the first two, just with different actors. In the original Scream film they made a point to almost mock and make fun of typical slasher films. Now this series has just become everything that the first film set out to make fun of. I knew about 30 minutes into this film that I was going to hate it. But once they revealed the BIG SHOCKING ENDING, all I could do was laugh. Laugh really loud, and really hard. And I wasn't the only one in the theatre doing so. If you're going to waste your time and rent this, you'll at least be entertained by the music. That's about all that kept me watching.",Scream 3
227,TruPretender,Finally-some sense of this madness!,7,3 January 2006,"Director Wes Craven decided to wait a good three years before making this final installment to the overdone Kevin Williamson screen shocker ""Scream"". This film was actually much BETTER for me. To start, the concept was a little different from it predecessors. The plot is more personal, and I DO mean personal. When dealing with such tactics as the last two, a third one would have only worked if a NEW writer stepped in, to both restore the feel, and create a new kind of formula for which the characters will be defined. I am pleased to say that, after original creator Williamsons departure from the writing booth, we were given a new, fresh camp feel by scriptwriter Ehren Kruger. He makes the continuation chilling, funny, and interesting. He puts the seriousness at certain, and appropriate moments, unlike the original writer. What is put together, is a real finale, or climax to what started four years earlier.First off, we know all could be well after the college murders in 2, I mean, who else has the nerve to take on Sidney Prescott and her henchmen? Well, there really IS someone who is willing to take the odds, and as such, does a good enough job, but not without giving the characters a real juicy bygone to work against. Gotton Weary, convicted killer of Sidney Prescotts' mother, is now as famous as he dreamed in ""2"", until he realizes that someone is messing with his phone. Basically, another madman is here to break the silence. There is one specific detail, along with wanting to kill Sidney, he causes confusion, by needing her personal information. Now, that said, he slashes his way through the set of a third ""Stab"" installment while he is at his bloody best. Who is he, and why, after three years of solace, would he lash out now? Dewey, Gail, and a determined police chief pursue this monster, and why he is ruining the lives of celebrities in attempt to find Sidney.David Arquette is, as always, a good blend of comic, neediness which proves to be cute, and yet brave in an hour of need. He gives a deeper feel for the geeky cop, as life has gone on with out Gail Weathers, who also returns. Courtney Cox has also kept true to her character, by putting Gail on a new level of bitchiness. Gail is now a real standard-setter, but without Dewey, she has no depth other than 60 Minutes 2. Neve Cambpell is, for the third time, a silent, passive formation for her famous ""Sidney"". The tough stuff from her inner strength is needed in this final caper, and it's there, hiding, just like her physical being, who is afraid to actually live. Finally, after numerous deaths, Sidney is out to confront the new psycho. Other cast members include Parker Posey as a stereo-typical actress, looking for better work than a scary movie. Portraying Gail Weathers in the new STAB film, she attach's herself to Coxs' Gail for research and security. Posey is funny as usual, very entertaining. Also included, is Lance Henrickson, a vet of the genre as a sleazy B-Movie director, a brief appearance by Jamie Kennedy, as his usual movie-master Randy Meeks, from an old tape. This time, Kennedys' dialog is more tolerable. Last, but NEVER least, is a funny cameo by Carrie Fisher, as a caracatcher, making fun of herself.The script was well thought out, and the dialog, much better, and even creepy at times. A great bow is to be given to the makers of this film, as it was most likely, not too easy to go back to the same characters and storyline again. Still, a good film ends up as the result of a better produced script, and a better direction for the series in general. The film does have its flaws, but they don't seem to shadow over the enjoyment, as this high camp, creepy climax plays to the final act...literally.Wes Craven, doing his usual number, makes this one as enjoyable as he can, and rightly so. Thank heavens we will not be seeing anymore ""Scream"" movies.Patrick Dempsey, Heather Matarezzo, Jenny McCarthy, Kelly Rutherford, Emily Mortimer, and Scott Foley also star.",Scream 3
228,HulkVader,"Scream 3 gets a ""3""",3,27 September 2000,"Slasher movies are just plain lame.  Has there been a good one since Halloween?  With slasher flicks, there is nothing new under the sun. Everything that can be done, has been done.  I remember some of the excitement that was generated over the first Scream was due to just that -- people claimed that it was different from slasher movies past, it had some new twists.  Not so.  But every ten years or so, the new teen generation needs a scary movie icon.  Whether it's Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, or the Scream killer.  This movie has nothing original, and is not worth even a rental.  The only reason it got a ""3"" was for the cool cameo by Jay and Silent Bob.  Cheers!",Scream 3
229,howellgirl2011,Someone's out looking for blood as in Sydney Prescott's blood!,10,21 January 2011,I loved this film so much. I was happy that Cotton was in the film for a short time but at least he had a chance to have a life until the killer found him and killed him inside his home. I had thought that the killer was trying to get to Sydney last instead of trapping her in a room with the killer(aka her half-brother). I was shocked and terrified when he had revealed his identity to Sydney. I thought that he would knock her out and tie her to a chair and talk to her then figure out how he could easily kill her. I was holding my breath when the camera centered in on Dewey and Gale tied up and nearly killed right around Sydney. But I was scared when the killer trapped her in a room and revealing himself to her and showing her clips of her mother before she had died. I loved this film so much that I hope that another sequel comes out and really is a bit more modified to this version a little. I did hear of a new film Scream 4 coming out this year and I am so excited because I graduate this year and this one was of my favorite films. I hope that Sydney still lives and the killer dies in the film!,Scream 3
230,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,"Great fun, wrapping up the trilogy nicely",8,10 June 2000,"Funny, I came to this movie expecting to be disapointed. I thought Scream 2 sucked, and they couldn't even be bothered to bring Scream's daddy, Kevin Williamson, back to write the ending to the trilogy. Instead, we get the guy who wrote that dismal little terrorist movie, Arlington Road. But Wes Craven is doing it, so at least it will look slick. Man, what a surprise! After the opening scene I turned to the person next to me and said, ""It's already better than the second one!"" (the first Scream still kicks the most booty).The cast didn't leave much of an impression. Other than the returning characters, the only performances I enjoyed were Parker Posey and Warrburton (David Puddy!). The rest look and sound like the usual, run of the mill soon-to-be dead teenagers, and poor Lance Henrikson isn't given much to do. The guys a good actor, someone give him a meaty role he can sink his teeth into!God bless the Scream films, since they have guaranteed about another decade of cheap, slasher film clones and rip-offs, just like when the were all the rage after the success of John Carpenter's Halloween. I can't complain though. With the kind of coin the Scream films have taken in, as well as a few others (The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, etc.), we are in the middle of a horror movie renaissance, and I couldn't be happier, horror film buff that I am.
Anyway, i'm giving the movie 8/10 stars. Fast paced, exciting, funny, but slows down in the third act and gets a little stale toward the end. The ending worked for me, and didn't annoy me like the garbage that was the end of Scream 2. Wes! Don't leave horror movies, buddy! They're making a comeback! G'night!",Scream 3
231,david_popa,A cool movie but not in comparation with the first two parts,5,16 July 2000,"This movie does not compare with Scream 1 or 2. It has a much more weak script (maybe because Kevin Wiliamson didn't wrote it) and it isn't very original. The actors don't look so good the action doesn't have any big surprizes. I expect a better movie and, like many other peopels, I was a little bit disapoint when I saw it.",Scream 3
232,daniel-stilgard,Long,1,13 September 2008,Scream 3 it is a not so good horror-movie. It is the most ultimated horror-movie I have ever seen! There are a lot of disgusting scenes.It is excitement and scary. This horror-movie should banned. The Scream-series have bestial violence.Neve Campbell acts very good in Scream 3. Scream 3 have also too terrible scenes that I fell very bad.Scream 3 have high scores by Neve Campbells acting.I can't understand why they do this sort of horror-movies! It is very sick.,Scream 3
233,very_doubtful,"Better than Scream 2, but still far behind the original Scream",7,4 July 2000,"Let me start by saying that the third installment in this highly successful trilogy was not worse than Scream 2. On the other hand it wasn't much better than the first sequel, well, maybe a little...When I heard that the Scream-team had to do without Kevin Williamson as screenwriter I was rather sceptical. But I have to admit that Ehren Kruger did a decent job. He copied the style of Kevin Williamson instead of trying to come with new aspects and I was glad he did so because many other sequels in the horror genre failed because the screenplay contained new ideas which ruined the film. Scream 3 has a solid screenplay, not as clever as the one of the original, but without any major flaws.The body count (although it is not a very gory film) is higher than in its two predecessors. And this time the killer is able to make his voice sound like the ones of his soon-to-be victims. I think this was supposed to increase the suspense (is it the killer or is it the person it seems to be?) but personally, I think it was a rather lame and somehow ""cheap"" idea.The characters: Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) looks better than in Scream 2, Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox-Arquette) looks like a skeleton with messed-up haircut, Dewey (David Arquette) returned back to normal state of mind, Carrie Fisher has a nice cameo and Lance Henriksen is cool as always (too bad he wasn't given more on-screen time). Any questions?In Scream 2 I really hated Kevin Williamson for killing off my favored character Randy (Jamie Kennedy). I always thought there was something wrong about his death. I was positively surprised by his appearance in Scream 3, even if it was just on videotape.Overall, Scream 3 is a good sequel. However, the ending should have revealed anything more spectacular than what it actually did. This trilogy should have ended with a big surprise, something that would stay in your mind (remember Randy in Scream 2?: ""I'd let the geek get the girl.""). The film wasn't as scary as the first two, the only eerie scene was Neve's first vision of her mother.Watch this one if you liked the first two films, if you haven't seen those yet, watch them first.My rating: 7/10 (I gave Scream 2 a 6/10)",Scream 3
234,vhilden,I had never thought murder could be so much fun,10,3 July 2000,"To enjoy this film, you should keep this in mind: it's NOT a thriller, don't expect any suspense! It's not a drama, don't expect complex characters! It's not a horror story, don't expect gore! It's instead a very funny parody of a horror film. If you go for the laughs, you will have a lot of fun.As in all films about making films, expect tons of self references. Carrie Fisher has a very good cameo everyone will catch, but there are many film references thrown all around, I certainly missed many of the more obscure ones.A good parody must be logical, not with the ""reasonable"" kind of logic we call ""common sense"", but the twisted yet precise logic used in jokes. And, a very uncommon thing in Hollywood, this film is technically precise in the details. For instance, revolvers fire six shots and no more, automatics have larger magazines. When the lights go out at the house and the fax still works, one can clearly see the battery-powered ""no-break"" power supply there: it's the beige box with the green light right besides the fax machine. A precise detail, yet only experts would catch it; that's why I mentioned there must be many movie references I missed.But all the normal horror movie clichés are there for anyone to see. That's why there are no complex characters in the film, since everyone must behave as typical horror movie characters do. When a group of people is in a big house full of secret passages with a killer loose, for instance, what do they do? Each one goes in a different direction, to be murdered alone, of course!Only the heroine has any brains at all. She can be as stupid as the rest when she is overwhelmed by the feelings about her mother, but if anyone at all survives in the end it's because of her smart precautions and quick reasoning. It's something like the punch line of a joke, where all your expectations are reversed: in a film about movie clichés the prettiest girl is the smartest character. And what a pretty sight she is, I wonder where in the IMDB can I find Neve's private phone number...Judging from the IMDB rating demographics, this film has been enjoyed most by the under 18 age group, but I recommend it for everyone who likes a good laugh at any age.",Scream 3
235,shuz,Solid ending to a great trilogy,8,5 February 2000,"I saw Scream 3 this afternoon and was pleasantly surprised at how well they managed to end a great horror trilogy.  This one was definitely played more as a horror/comedy than the prior two, but the inspired casting made it work.Parker Posey is perfectly cast as the actress playing Gale Weathers in the pseudo movie ""Stab 3"".  She steals every single scene she is in, make sure to watch her facial expressions throughout.  The movie is worth a watch for her alone! Carrie Fisher also has a hilarious cameo.",Scream 3
236,Mileskolehmainen,"Not quite as good as two, but still pretty great.",8,10 November 2014,"Another underrated sequel. Scream 3 gets ragged on a lot for being a little more flashy and fantastical than the the first two scream movies, saying that it became the sort of movie it was making fun of, but I think that all this was just to put a new twist on the movie, like Scre4m (scream four) has more comedy. So that aside, I also liked the rest of the movie a lot. The writing is very good. The dialog is decent and the finale is excellent, and just like in part one and two, the suspense is effective. You will be on the edge of your seat for many scenes. The characters are once again likable, and they finally did one of my favorites justice. So I would recommend this movie to fans of the other Scream movies, and people who are into the teen slasher genre. I give Scream 3 8.4/10 (P.S. Don't visit Scre4m's IMDb page so you won't know what characters survive.",Scream 3

Dewey and Gale get on the case and persuaded Sidney out of hiding to figure out what her dead mother, Maureen, has to do with this new wave of killings.There's more more emphasis on humor here and some of it works and some of it simply grates and you can feel the filmmakers holding back an awful lot, giving the movie a dull, safe quality that neither of the previous films have. For something pegged as a big finale to the trilogy, it's not as exciting and grand as it should be. The three leads give capable and charming performances, but the only new cast member able to rise to their level and endear them to us fairly quickly is Parker Posey as a hilariously self-absorbed actress who's playing Gale in the new Stab movie. If Scream 3 were a car, Posey would be the gas that keeps it running.",Scream 3
238,rtcnz,The worst SCREAM film - but not a completely bad film,10,14 October 2011,"The premise of Scream 3 is excellent - it's about the filming of the film-within-the-film, Stab 3, with the cast being picked off in the order that they die in Stab 3. Great idea. Even greater is the pairing of Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) and the actress playing Gale Weathers in Stab 3 (Parker Posey).So why doesn't this film quite get off the ground? Firstly, because of its many, many locations. Police stations, studio offices, film sets, star's homes - but by far the worst location is where the finale takes place: the executive's mansion. It's your archetypal 'haunted' house - secret doorways, chambers, basements full of props, and so on.Which brings me to my second point. There's a 'supernatural' element to this film that breaks completely with the tone of the Scream films. The ghost of Sidney's mother features, much to the film's detriment.Thirdly - without spoiling it - the 'revelation' at the end of who was behind the murders. This is by far the most disappointing ending in any whodunit slasher. This is perhaps because none of the characters are developed particularly well, so we can't bring ourselves to care.",Scream 3
239,GoreMonger,I stood in line for this? Where's my bang for my buck?,5,4 February 2000,"I am a huge fan of the horror genre. I've seen great horror films and I've seen horrible horror films.

There's no new ground broken here and you'll get that ""hey, I've seen this before"" feeling many times before the ending credits roll.

Ethan Kruger (Arlington Road, Reindeer Games) did. All of the main characters return, but no-one really cares about them anymore. It now takes place in Hollywood, where the movie Stab 3, is taking place. However, killings begin to happen and suspicion arises. Wes Craven vowed that this would be the last Scream, and it's a good decision, as it's gone from scary to mediocre. The best bit? Death by house blowing up. Cool.",Scream 3
241,davidhutch007,Better than Scream 2 & on Par With The Original,8,1 August 2005,"This is the second sequel to Scream that made audiences laugh and made them Scream. The film again brings back all the main characters from the first two (unless they were picked off) and puts them right back into the horror, where the ghostface killer is going to finish what nobody else could. In Scream 3 we find Sidney living on her own and she has changed her identity so that she cannot be found. She is having nightmares about her past and once she gets wind of the killing taking place on a movie of her life she has to investigate. Gail is also in Hollywood checking out the murders and catches up with Dewey who is working on the film as an adviser. With the Ghostface killer once again on the loose killing the cast of the new Stab film its upto Sidney, Gail and Dewey to makesure this isn't their final cut.This film offers more than you might think and also a lot better death scenes including a character at the beginning who has been in all three of the Scream films. Again with Craven behind the camera he steers a steady ship and does not make this the typical cliché third film in a franchise. The ending does tie up the whole trilogy which i thought was very good because i feel there is no need to go any further as these film are great as a trilogy!Ehren Kruger who wrote this film brings a breath of fresh air to what could have become a pile of trash. Kevin Williamson wrote the first two films and had always intended there to be a trilogy but after No 2 i am glad a new writer was brought in just to add some spice to the franchise. The film offers a great ending which explains quite a few things from the original and second film. The ending is also riveting and leaves you on the edge of your seat gasping for air as the finale plays out.The cast is great, the story is great and overall this film rounds up one of the best horror franchises ever and don't be diturred by the critics view it for yourself first then make a judgement!!!Wes Craven does it again proving that the rules of a trilogy don't always apply.MuSt SeE!!!!!!",Scream 3
242,negeati,A very disappointing trilogy finale,6,4 February 2000,"I have never been so disappointed. ""Scream"" was the best horror I have seen. ""Scream 2"" was almost as good as the original, except it was a bit less intelligent. The second sequel is a lot dumber than both previous movies, but it still has some smart moments. I liked the way they killed off one of the characters, by blowing him up. ""The one who lives is the one who can smell the gas."" Or something like that. Unfortunately this was the only idea worthy of the movie's predecessors. Where there are no ideas, there is fun. A lot of fun. And by saying this, you can easily identify what kind of movie ""Scream 3"" was. Do you think you saw a horror movie? You're so wrong. This was a very black comedy.There are three things that are part of the ""Scream"" trilogy frame. A scary beginning, furious and engrossing stabbing scenes and a high energy ending. ""Scream 3"" fails in all of them. In the beginning of the first two movies, special guest stars Drew Barrymore, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Omar Epps were killed in a very stylish and scary way. In this movie, Liev Schreiber is killed off in a scary, but not so stylish way. He was not a guest star, but a regular. Secondly, the stabbing scenes are very much diluted. I want to see them just like they were done in the previous movies. Call me morbid, but I want to see the knife entering the flesh of the victim. None of those kind of scenes are present in ""Scream 3"", save one when the knife actually stabs an anti-bullet vest. Finally, the ending. The previous ""Screams"" had a very high kinetic energy. This movie ended for me when the killer (yes, it is only one killer) demasks himself about 20 minutes prior to actual end. And I said to myself: What? Several seconds passed until I remembered who he was. Most murder mysteries are like that, you never know who the killer is until the ending. Usually it is a asset, but in this case it is a flaw. Boring. The acting is as usual: strong. Neve Campbell, Courtney and David Arquette have great fun as regulars. Parker Posey is wonderful as the actress who plays Gale Weathers in Stab 3. But I think the biggest surprise is Patrick Dempsey. I saw recently a scene from the abominable ""Meatballs 3"" made 12 years ago and he looked hopelessly geeky and icky. Now at the age of 33, he looks fantastic. You do not see too many examples of such surprising changes.   Some very funny cameos are present. Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes as Silent Bob and Jay (from ""Dogma"") and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia from ""Star Wars IV"", V, and VI) make the movie even more funny than it actually is.
But I did not come to see a comedy. I have come to see a horror movie. And I do not believe this is the end of the series, since all 3 protagonists survive. I recommend only because it is mindless fun. What a shame.

243,applehuntr,Very Disappointing,5,24 October 2000,"I walked out of the theater wanting to like ""Scream 3"", I loved the first two, but I just couldn't bring myself to say it was a satisfying end to the Scream trilogy. Kevin Williamson didn't write this one, he decided to focus on his other project, Teaching Mrs. Tingle (He is probably kicking himself over that right now). The biggest disappointment was that it was not scary at all, no suspense. Sidney, Gale, and Dewey don't even act like the ones we know and love from the first two. Sidney hasn't got any energy, she just mopes around. Gale hasn't learned a damned thing from her first two experiences, she is still a b*tch with no heart. Dewey is just dumb, not funny dumb, just dumb. This movie was a waste of talent, besides Courtney, Neve, and David, it has also got Parker Posey. They all act like they would rather be somewhere else, and after seeing this movie, you can't blame them. ** out of ****",Scream 3
244,marcfantozzi,Nowhere near as good as the first two Scream films.,10,22 April 2001,"It has to be said, Scream 3 is not as good as it's earlier films. Now, I am a huge fan of Scream 3, believe it or not. When Scream 2 rolled around, I was shocked at how good it turned out to be, I was so looking forward to Scream 3. Three long years I waited. A lot of people have told me that Scream 3 is boring and not as enjoyable as the first two films. I feel this is because writer Kevin Williamson did not write this one. Williamson has a unique style in his writing. He creates characters we care about and his scripts are always witty and a lot of fun. Scream 3 seems much more serious than the first two. Neve Campbell, as always, turns in a great performance. I really felt for Sid as her demons came back. On the other hand, I didn't like Courteney Cox-Arquette's performance and the chemistry between Dewey and Gale. They have both changed so much. And what the hell is with the gore in this film? Now I am not a big fan of gore in horror films. I don't mind it, but Scream 3 had none. I am trying to think of the most creative death and all I can come up with is the whole frying pan thing!! I didn't get it. The first two films were very violent and had quite a lot of gore, yet the deaths seemed realistic. Scream 3 had none. I think that the producers were slack this time around. This film hasn't the spark that the earlier films had. But I DO love Scream 3. When I saw it in the theater I was blown away. I had so much fun and couldn't wait for it to arrive on video hire shelves. But when it came to video and I watched it over and over again, I realised it could have been so much better. I know I am being really harsh and Scream 3 is above average and could have been so much worse. It's just when you have waited for a film for so long, and it's not as good as you expected, you feel a little bitter. I won't lie, if Scream 4 ever is released I will kill to see it, but I only hope, perhaphs, it will be an improvement. But see Scream 3. It wraps up everything quite well, it's just not as enjoyable as the first two, though, it has a lot of funny and well done moments. I will give it 10 out of 10, considering it is my third favorite film!",Scream 3
245,marcfantozzi,I love you Neve Campbell and Parker Posey!,10,31 May 2001,"I was way too harsh before. Scream 3 is above average. Courteney Cox-Arquette turned in a decent performance and there is some great humour in this flick. While not as good as Scream and Scream 2, Scream 3 is a ""cut"" above the rest. I look forward to Scream 4. God, I cant wait. Ehren Kruger is great, but it would be nice if Kevin Williamson could write the fourth installment! Keep on screaming!!!!!",Scream 3
246,Scream-11,A Little Disappointing,7,5 February 2000,"I understand that my expectations were so high walking into the theater that practically no movie could've satisfied me, but I'm still a little disappointed at the long-awaited finale to the Scream trilogy.  While the first two were character-driven with murders to increase tension, this film was blood-driven with minimal characterization -- it felt like only Williamson could write these characters as being kinda wacky and out there but believable.  I don't deny that Scream 3 delivered on the tension and scares -- it definitely did, and once again, the ending was a surprise to me, so I don't consider my time wasted, but I feel rather let-down by the flaws in the characters I have come to know and love.",Scream 3
247,Juniore,Not too bad,4,11 January 2002,"I guess this movie was alright. I have always been a fan of the Scream series and I enjoyed this one. The writers put way too much humor into the movie though. They didn't keep a dark enough tone like they did in the first and second. Despite this it was still a good movie, entertaining, scary, creative, etc. It is a great way to end the wonderful horror series.",Scream 3
248,TheMikeJustice,Scream 3 rocked my world!,9,4 February 2000,"Not only was I not disappointed, but I was greatly impressed and quite satisfied with Scream 3.  The only fault I had with the movie was that some of the ""witty"" dialog between Gale Weathers and Parker Posey, as well as the actors' conversation on the set of STAB 3, seemed a little too forced, like the writer was trying hard to sound like Kevin Williamson.  Otherwise I loved the movie.  Sydney truly is a role model for us all--strong, stable, and able to bounce back from traumatizing incidents with gusto.  Maybe a little too much gusto, along with a nonchalance bordering on autism...  But whatever, it's a great film.  Wonderful, I loved it, etc.",Scream 3
249,gga,The original is still the best one...,5,13 February 2000,"Scream 3 starts extremely well with a sequence that has the suspense and chills as in the original Scream, just before the main titles. Unfortunately, everything goes downhill from there.  Suposedly, Williamson had always sustained that the Scream franchise was a trilogy from the start. I sincerely doubt it.  Not only was this one not penned by him, but the ending, the killer with its far-fetched killing motives and modus operandi, will leave more than one disappointed and maybe even saying ""what?"".  If you thought the killer/killers in Scream 2 were far-fetched, you have seen nothing yet!. This chapter takes even less seriously than the others, and there's a lot of inside Hollywood jokes.  Jokes that, for many, will go unnoticed and even for those in the know, will probably still feel flat.  From the Kevin Smith's characters cameo to many of the lines uttered by Jenny McCarthy (...the shower scene in ""Vertigo"" ;). One problem with this installment is that Sidney is almost nowhere to be seen for the first 80 minutes of the movie.  I'm not a fan of Neve Campbell, but her character is supposed to be the main reason for the killings.  And she does not play any significant role until the third act! But the biggest problems are the big holes in the story (there are so many, I could fill a couple of pages listing them).  Most of the plot turns stretch the audience belief, and it is too obvious the writer was running out of ideas on how to get all the characters together under the same roof to have the killer go after them. The one thing that made the original Scream great was its solid script and its great and original ending, while still adhering to all the rules that were listed as necessary for scary movies. And nothing of that is found here in this, I hope, final chapter.",Scream 3
250,kausix777,Funny,4,19 December 2010,"I'm rating this quite low because it was much below the expectations set by watching Scream 1 and 2, of which I'd really liked 2.This one somehow appeared to be a lot of comedy with not much of tension, really. There was way too much screaming, quite a few red herrings, etc. At times, I wondered if I was watching Scream 3 or the spoof series called ""Scary Movie"".Even the villain of the piece did not look convincing and I did not understand his motive either. Overall, this one is a good candidate to win the comedy award for slashers. One can watch it if one wants to complete the series but there is not much of thrill to speak of.",Scream 3
251,niteman,A fitting goodbye to a great series.,8,12 February 2000,"Scream was a great, great horror flick.  It took the cliches that horror movie fans have been enjoying (and bemoaning) for years and twisted them back on themselves, for the first time making a horror movie that acknowledged the existence of horror movies and their fans.  Scream 2 was less of a thrill; it had some great scenes and set pieces, but faltered in the denoument, giving us a laughable finale instead of a scary one.Scream 3 gets back to what made Scream great.  What sets this series apart is the intelligence factor, and Scream 3 doesn't dissapoint.  Plots get turned around and eat their own tails, everyone's a suspect, and in the end the answer is both completely obvious and impossible to predict.  It dovetails perfectly into the first two, expanding the mythos without cheating the audience.The director and screenwriter are savvy enough to realize that just hearing some guy's distorted voice over the phone isn't that scary anymore, so they look elsewhere for suspense and scares, and find plenty of both.  There are great scenes involving Sidney Prescott's supposed mental problems, they're both frightening and make perfect sense -- wouldn't you be a little ding-y if all your friends were killed by a series of psychopaths?I won't say anything about the plot, because the less you know, the better. Just make sure you've seen the first two before you go in, or you'll be completely lost.  I'm sure non-horror fans won't like this one (witness the critical beating it's been given), but anyone who's looking for a good scare will find it here.",Scream 3
252,Oz-27,A Worthy end to an Amazing Trilogy,9,13 February 2000,"I was very worried that with the final chapter in the scream saga that some how it would turn out bad. The first 2 are some of my favorite films so i was worried that this one would end up being disappointing. Boy was i wrong. Though this isn't the scariest of the trilogy, it's the most thought provoking. It ties up all the loose ends that were brought up in the first 2 and the final chapter really does have an interesting story to tell. This film gives the chracters and the audience watching the film the closure they need.first of all when the movie started i was a tad bit dsappointed. the opening scene wasn't very thrilling and it was a little short so i though oh boy this isn't starting off right. it was a descent opening scene. i jumped a few times but it didn't have the shock value the first 2 had. despite that flaw when scream 3 finally gets started we get involved in a mystery that somehow takes us back to where it all began. this mystery involves sidney's mother who had a secret life of her own. speaking of sidney, in this installment she is in hiding, this is because ""Psychos can't kill what they can't find"". While sidney is in hiding she begins to have visions of her dead mother. proving that the evnets in her life have finally taken a toll on her. meanwhile in hollywood they are making Stab 3 and when the cast begins to die in the order they die in the script it's up to dewey who si working as an aid on the set and Gale, who is summoned by the FBI to help in the case to solve this mystery. pretty soon sidney makes it to hollywood and the real fun begins.I've always thought that the scream films always managed to produce and create interesting characters. this one is no exception. Neve Campbell is in top form as sidney. In fact in this one she becomes a fighter and has no intention on giving up. neve plays her well and shows us that sidney has grown between films. David arquette is also good as dewey. he isn't as goofy this time around but he's still very funny. i like courtney coc but this gale weathers was different from the firsr 2. i think that she shouyld've played it bitchy again, when she's nice she loses her edge. she was still good but she could've been betterThe characters are a mixed bag(since most of them are just there to get killed) Parker Posey supplies the film with most of its comice relief. she was really good in the role and i thought she was a good new character. jenny macartney was adequate as sarah darling, an actress who is 35 and tired of playing 21 year olds. Scott foley was also good as a directer who's film is being sabotage by a violent killer.The ending was much better than the ending in scream 2. i thought that this endingsolves all the problems that sisdney had been wondering about. at times it seemd cheesy but i do think that it was good and much better than scream 2's ending.I'm glad they decided to end it now because i would hate to see them ruin a good thing. they ended it like they should've. i'll now remember this a trilogy that made me laugh and most of all made me Scream.

253,timtindy,still scary -- a 7 out of 10,7,7 February 2000,"I went into Scream 3 with only one hope -- not to be disappointed.  With a new screenwriter on board (the guy who wrote the abysmal Arlington Road), I was concerned.  But Scream 3, thanks to its director Wes Craven, is every bit as scary as the first two (with the exception of the first 10 minutes, which have gotten progressively worse with each film).The movie is funny as usual, though not as funny as the first and especially the second one.  But it IS genuinely scary, and I especially appreciated the closure that a fan of the series will get at the end.Recommended to anyone who liked the first two.",Scream 3

Overall I liked it , its a good slasher of the 2000's much better than Urban legends final cut which also had a film industry vibe and felt like a complete copycat at times.

It was such a delight to see after viewing so many crappy horror films, i still love it to this day and know all the words to it as i do with Scream 3. Now its not quite as good as the original but i do love it and the idea of it being set in Hollywood was very good. Its a very entertaining film with lots of scares and lots and lots of blood, which is always good. The idea for this film is great and the acting as always is spot on, and it was a real delight to see Randy back if only for a few minutes.

I also like the scenes with Sidney seeing her mother all the time...and this time i wanted Dewey to REALLY DIE!!!! argghhh...but no Ghostface Had them right there tied up but instead let's them live.Overall i enjoyed it but not as much as the other two defiantly probably the goriest out of all them...except maybe a few scenes from scream 1 and 2...i recommend this movie to most people defiantly need to have it if you have scream 1 and 2.",Scream 3

260,votesmall,The only thing that needed help in this film is Gale's hair....,9,12 November 2011,"First of all, I must say that I did not have high expectations for this film. All of the critics (which I usually don't agree with anyway) and even fans of the series have stated that this is the worst in the series. There is no such thing as a bad Scream film. Each film is awesome. So, needless to say, I walked into this without high expectations. I was planning to rent a copy from Mr. Movies, but needless to say, I found a free showing on AMC. The actual film exceeded my expectations. I absolutely loved it. Sure, it wasn't as violent as others in the series, but that's because of the Columbine High School massacre. Basically, Sidney, who is in hiding, is lured to Hollywood by a new copycat Ghostface killer, onto the set of the new Stab film. David Arquette as Dewey and Scott Foley as Roman are at the top of their game in this. Roman is one of my favorite Ghostfaces, simply because he is just so freaking hilarious. He doesn't over do it like Freddy Krueger, but he makes it all so enjoyable, and I was so shocked to see Roman as the killer, but man, did he have a motive! Parker Posey is a real treat to bring in, and so are Patrick Dempsey and Jenny McCarthy. This entire cast is amazing, though I hated to see Cotton Weary (Leiv Schreiber) die, even though he was a sleaze. I also have no idea why everyone is hating on Ehren Kruger. Sure, it isn't Kevin Williamson, but I think he is a worthy author to the Scream series, using the same style as Williamson. I thought that this was a very worthy entry into the series. Roman is easily the smartest Ghostface, who brings a new, high tech voice changer to the picture, and since it is Hollywood, you get to see some of the best special effects, including a fake corpse Roman uses to trick everyone.All in all, I thought, that though relying more on comedy and suspense then its predecessors, you can't really blame it. I mean, violence in cinema was really controversial at the turn of the century. I was happy with it, and I was honestly surprised more people weren't.",Scream 3

262,Chandlergellar,Scream 3 was an awful way to end a brilliant trilogy!,6,1 August 2005,"When i bought ""Scream 3"" i was exited because i loved the first two movies, but to my shock, this must have been the worst ending to a movie ever! maybe I'm being a bit to over the top but they cast people with no talent, and nobodies! the only person that i had recognised what Jenny McCarthy but her acting was dreadful, i hate to admit it but Courtney Coxs and David Arquettes acting wasn't all that either, the only person that i think made this movie work was bringing back Neve Campbell because shes the only decent actress/actor in the entire movie. also i didn't like it how they ruined the original plot that we loved, i.e a 3rd person killed Maureen Prescott? WTF? i just didn't like it because they toyed with the originals deaths and said that Billy Loomis didn't kill these people but Maureens son did, thats why i dislike this movie and thinking it should have ended a different way. Why did Wes Craven ruin this other films story lines and motives by making out that Sidneys Mom had a secret life and why didn't Sidney or her dad know about this???? anyway... basically they are making a film called ""Stab 3"" based on the Woodsbro and Windsor college murders and the cast members are being killed off in order they die in the movie but there are 3 version of the script and no one knows who will drop next, i don't find that is very original! plus the deaths are so random, why kill some whinny bitch's body guard? why? also i haven't seen acting this terrible since ""Power Rangers"" and other silly horror films such as ""Freddy Vs Jason"". i would have enjoyed this movie a) if they hadn't ruined the other memory's of ""Scream 1"" B) cast more talented actors C)killed off David Arquettes character and finally D) never introduced Maureen Prescotts secret life. i think that it could have been about either a group of new teens or a good story evolving around Sidney and her trying to get on with her life but someone from Woodsbro is out to get revenge or something and not murder helpless actors on a set and find out its your brother, BAD IDEA! to summarise they better not do a ""Scream 4"" and if they do put new teens in it because Neve Campbell doesn't want to be involved (good for you) to finish here are some pointers: Acting was terrible apart from SEXY Neve Campbell who saved the film don't cast people with no careers ahead or porn stars i.e Jenny McCarthy,6/10 thats all, i only watch it for Neve because shes very HOT!",Scream 3

264,WandrinStar,Scream 3 (2000),6,24 April 2012,"62/100. Considering it was coming off two of the most successful horror films of the 90's, Scream 3 does pretty good for itself especially when one takes in consideration other horror movies made in the same year. It definitely misses Kevin Williamson's input, but despite the criticism he's garnered from this film, I felt that Ehren Kruger did a passable job. The only negative aspect from his script was keeping Sidney in exile. Considering most horror movies generally wane by the second sequel, the story didn't need to have another uphill battle by having the main character stuck in isolation for half the movie. But somehow Kruger made it work as I felt he really nailed the character of Sidney and how she would react to her previous battles. Basically the time in the first two that would have been used to develop Neve was used on Dewey and Gale who are the de facto stars until Sidney finally arrives in Hollywood. Even though I'm a Wes Craven fan, his direction seemed a little off compared to his other works. A lack of a Williamson script kept the film from finding the right mixture of laughs and scares generally focusing more on the former than the latter. What makes this even more ineffective is Craven's use for a more dark atmosphere which along with some of the more serious situations present in the trilogy is at constant odds with the abundance of humor. Examples being the Jay and Silent Bob cameo along with Carrie Fisher's role; these detracted from the film's tone. With that said, Scream 3 continues the franchise's trend of being one of the smarter horror series out there. I actually was a fan of the Hollywood location, which provided great genre jokes and help carefully paint horror movie cliché's only this time from a behind the scenes perspective. Outside of yet another annoying performance by Parkey Posey, the supporting class was exceptional and although the killer(s) identity was uninspired and random, the final showdown was actually an improvement over Scream 2's finale by finding a way to effectively do the job the filmmakers set out to do by making a satisfactory ending to an entertaining trilogy...until Scream 4. Jamie Kennedy's has a taped cameo, but it makes you miss the character's presence from the series more than anything.",Scream 3
265,Malifer,This is not my favorite scary movie.,4,5 February 2000,"Jay and Silent Bob are the best part of this film. Without getting into any spoilers, the biggest problem is that this movie doesn't live up to any of its promises. It isn't anymore than another sequel. What promises are broken, well they talk about the rules of the third installment of a trilogy and don't follow them. This could be consider fake foreshadowing to throw the viewer off, but I think it just shows just how unwilling they are to do something different with this film. Now there are a few good laughs and exciting moments, but I feel that although it is better than the scream 2 it isn't anything more than an average sequel and not a good ending to the trilogy.",Scream 3

Parker Posey is amusing and manages to come out of the film mostly unscathed, but everyone else seems to be phoning it in or playing it like they're in a sitcom.The stakes in the film are surprisingly low and you never really feel much danger for anyone.

267,horrorflicklover,An outstanding end to an outstanding trilogy,9,4 November 2014,"I really loved this movie, and I don't get the hate for it. If you want to look up sequels which are just expansive enough to round out the brand, but not over-the-top enough to ruin it, then Scream 3 is an great example. Probably the strongest reason I love this film is the story, and how well I think it's told. Sure, it involved some light retconning, but nothing that HONESTLY changed what the previous films stood for. That may be the case if we're dealing with an eternal killer (ala Freddy Krueger or Michael Myers), but Scream has had disposable killers behind Ghostface each time. Just as Scream 2 connects to the first one, Scream 3 connects to them all. And it does it beautifully. Are people upset that it changed the way they viewed the first film? Sure, but at the same time, it's the dynamic of a disposable killer, vs. an eternal one (read: How Michael Myers mystique was destroyed in the Halloween remake).Scream 3 didn't make the mistake of going so big that you just wished it would go home. Yes, it expanded the Scream universe. Yes, it got bigger in virtually every way. But it did it SENSIBLY. Aside from a lot of action and suspense, Scream 3 did a GREAT job of telling a story. With that, it did a great job of developing the chief players. A key theme of the entire Scream story are the sins of the past, and Scream 3 gave up a great plot which lined up all of the ducks in a row. Aside from a solid script, this film really shines for its mystery and suspense aspects. I loved the cat-and-mouse game between the protagonists and antagonists more than the previous films, because the script had REALLY put me in the position of feeling that this plan was even more masterfully constructed than those. Despite Neve Campbell's decreased participation in this film (due to wanting to avoid typecasting), her scenes are still prominent and memorable. Especially the psychological torment of her life experiences so far, heightened by the killer's own torment. With that, the typical support characters get an even bigger chance to shine, and I feel that this really shifted the entire dynamic of the film to match its larger atmosphere, and rounded it all out as a whole.Maybe I just loved the confrontation between protagonists and antagonists, and loved the motive. That scene really did it for me. But I guess many fans didn't dig the whole perceived ""Scooby And the Gang go to Hollywood"" vibe that they felt. Which I don't get. Perhaps if they made it campy and humorous, like later Nightmare films. But it's the same old cat-and-mouse that we've come to know and love, just on a bigger (and better scale). Admittedly, they couldn't stretch the premise much further, which is why I also felt there never should have been a Scream 4.Scream 3 is a lesson on how to finish off a trilogy. It's a lesson on how to expand your universe, how to build a great story which will complement, but not destroy your previous works. After this film, I said to myself ""It all ends perfectly, please no more"". Unfortunately, no one listened. Why do people hate it? I guess it's ""too Scooby Doo"". Which is ironic, as I despise Scooby Doo, and love this film. I thought it honored its franchise far more than most horror sequels do.",Scream 3
268,Mark-201,a fair movie,7,6 February 2000,"Scream 3 is a decent horror movie.  However, in falling in with the other Scream pics, it doesn't have the same humor.  It seems to take itself to seriously.  The best part is the inspired Jay and Silent Bob cameo.  The ending beats the hell out of the ending of scream 2, but the rest of the movie falls behind it.  Overall, its a decent movie",Scream 3
269,rejoefrankel,An awkward finale to a self assured trilogy.,5,16 February 2000,"Scream 3 starts promisingly.  It plays on the expectations generated by the first two films and their countless predecessors, and opens with a scene that you want to like!  The problem is, it doesn't quite live up.  You've come to the film to be entertained.  And entertaining it is, sporadically. But this Scream has the most awkward blend of gags and chills thus far.  In other words, parts of it are funny and parts of it are creepy, but the two approaches clash.  It no longer has any truly novel jokes to play out.  It keeps throwing in self referential puns and gags, but they are merely designed to distract from the thin material.  To distract from the fact that Scream 3 has become no different from all of the other movies that the first two films spoofed so well.  This doesn't mean that the movie doesn't have it's moments.  Wes Craven makes the most of his material, but Kevin Williamson's presence is sorely missed in this Scream, which doesn't know where to draw the line, and leaves its audience somewhat confused.  The revealed identity of the killer at the end is so unsatisfying, that I would rather have not found out.  And the final moments are a little too conventional.  Overall, if you liked the first two Screams you should still check out the third.  It is designed as a timepasser and on that level it succeeds.  The one real standout is Parker Posey, who makes the most of her role as a spoiled movie star, who is targetted in the adventure.  Otherwise, marginal thumbs down.",Scream 3

The film then takes us to young Sidney Hiding in the hills in a secluded home, using an alias name. The film then takes you to Hollywood California where Gail is once again reporting, and Dewey is a 'technical' adviser on the set of the film 'STAB 3' the latest installment of the Woodsboro murders. But when a masked killer starts to kill the stars on the set and stalk Sidney, The games begin until the suspenseful climax where the final act and twist is revealed...Scream 3 delivers with fresh jokes and good kills.

272,squill,Disappointing series ending,5,4 February 2000,"Definition: the `stupidity' factor   1. smart characters doing stupid things which result in peril; 2. underestimating the audience's intelligence. With the Scream trilogy complete we now know that it really is all about the script. Craven's direction remains a constant as do the leads. With part three, the in-crowd humor shines as brightly as parts 1 and 2. Sadly the last of these films eventually meets it's Waterloo in Ehron Kruger's script, especially in the second half of the film. Kevin Williamson, who scripted parts one and two, held his audience and characters in much higher regard, keeping the `stupidity' factor almost non-existent, or at least within believable limits.Unfortunately Kruger's `Scream 3' pushes the `stupidity' factor back up to the typically intolerable slasher film level, with main characters, who avoided stupidity in parts 1 and 2, now demonstrating they have not an ounce of sense or learned anything from past experience. In addition the plot twist to supply us with the reason for last of the slasher/slashers is blatantly guessable from the minute the first hint is dropped, even if the slasher/slasher's identity is not. And there is such an over-abundance of red-herrings and `off-camera' doings, that guessing the identity is simply pure luck  it could be any of many.Sadly, while a passable film, `Scream 3' ends the series on a very disappointing note.",Scream 3
273,demented_peruvian,Inferior; feels more like a rip-off than a sequel.,5,16 August 2006,"""Scream 3"" feels like it was done purely for the cash, with no ideas behind it. The few surviving characters are brought back, but most of the movie focuses on the Arquettes, whose characters have nothing new to cover or grow on. The new characters are all very annoying and their actors over-act at every chance (particularly Parker Posey). When one of them gets knocked off, you get a profound feeling of lack of interest. Their names are all weak homages/spoofs. Neve Campbell enters the action too late. The biggest problem, however, is the writing. The screenplay's examination of trilogies is really uninspired and underdeveloped, and its citation, reference, spoof, and homage of other horror movies is minimal, weak, and unimaginative. This is really the biggest step down, as it was the main selling point of the first two movies. The twist climax was also weak. The revelation of the killer was a random pick from the cast of characters, with no natural build-up to it.The only worthwhile elements: 1) the new additions in cell-phone technology to further disguise the killer; 2) that scene with the flying knife, which was the only creative spoof of cinema clichés and conventions; 3) some vague homages to AIP and Roger Corman; 4) the always reliable Lance Henrikssen.Stick to the first two movies.",Scream 3
274,PreOre72,SCREAM...because this film was made. Another terrible teen horror flick.,5,7 February 2000,"One of the tagline's for Wes Craven's third and final installment of the infamous ""Scream"" series is ""Someone has taken their love of trilogies one step too far.""  This tagline, alone, emphasizes how recycled this movie was going to be. We all remember the tagline from the original, don't we?I do have to say that ""Scream 3"" didn't let me down one bit because, going into the film, I had expectations of another terrible and tacky slasher flick. It certainly delivered that with, basically, every line said.Onto the part in the review where I talk about the plot.  Wait a minute, WHAT PLOT?!  Let's see if I can explain this paper thin subject for you, hopefully, educated readers.  Sidney (Neve Campbell) is in hiding because she was almost killed twice, miraculously surviving the odds, in the first two films.  Now ""Stab 3"" is being filmed, the movie being made in ""Scream 3"" about ""Scream 3"". Sounds confusing, well it's not and that is obvious because a lot of teenagers liked it and screenwriters try not to confuse them.  Why would you? It's your target audience. Anyway the murderer, still dressed in that ridiculous costume, is bumping the actors off one by one trying to reel Sidney in for the kill. Anyway that is basically the plot, besides the laughable motive the killer gives for all of this madness.The acting gets to you real quick because the characters are so annoying. Does anybody really like Dewey? For that matter, does anybody really like David Arquette? The rest of the characters are one dimensional and poorly portrayed.  Kevin Williamson didn't return to write this ""Scream"", the series which he created and wrote the first two, but I am glad he wasn't.  He loves to throw in terrible jokes at poor times (ex. Killer: What's your favorite scary movie? Randy: Showgirls...absolutely frightening). Williamson had to decline to write and direct the cinematic masterpiece ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle"". ""Scream 3"" was practically ""The Exorcist"" compared to ""Tingle"".  Ehren Kruger was hired to replace Willamson and kept the same low-brow plot and thin motives, for the killer.One redeeming quality was the beginning.  I have to admit that ""Scream 3"" had a fast paced surprising opening sequence but went downhill faster than Corey Feldman's career. Sorry Corey but you had that one coming for a long time for saying you should have received an Oscar instead of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who together made a great film.  Sorry I forgot about ""The Goonies"" and ""Stand by Me"", I mean that was only 14 years ago.All in all, if you have seen a ""Scream"" movie, it doesn't matter which one, then you have seen them all.5/10",Scream 3

276,SMGbuf,Finally closure...,10,1 July 2000,"To start, I love the original two films in the series and so obviously I was overly-hyped to see this supposed conclusion piece in the modern day classic slasher trilogy. Knowing that Kevin Williamson dropped out, and word that Neve Campbell may be next seemed to give the film a preemptive ill-fate feel. The outcome is fantastic. Personally, the first is and always will be the best in the series, and I'm not sure which comes next between two and three. There is the return of horror director Wes Craven, accompanied by Neve Campbell's nice portrayel of an innocent victim, Sidney Prescott, Courtney Cox Arquette's savvy reporter, Gale Weathers, and David Arquette's oafish deputy, Dewey Riley. This time the script is written by Ehren Kruger who gave us the excellent Arlington Road, though Williamson is obviously absent. The dialogue is a bit different, and the chills are lost a bit in too much self-referential dialogue. The cameo by Randy is great, as is this film. My few complaints come from the complete lack of gore, the somewhat less than impactful conclusion where the killer is revealed, and a mistake with police photos of Sidney I am surely one of the few who noticed.The film is excellent and it brings wonderful closure. I have to say that right now, this is the strongest horror series, for all of its films are mesmerizing. Halloween (the best horror film by far) was accomanied by two good sequals, two and seven, yet three through six were wretched. A Nightmare on Elm Street was great, as was Wes Craven's New Nightmare, but two through six sucked royally from bad one-liners and cheesy effects. Friday the 13th never had an astounding film, and from the rumors of Jason X, set in outer space, there never will be a great one. Don't miss Scream 3 for its one of the few teen slashers of the nineties that still holds its intelligence.",Scream 3

There are trilogies out there that are great but sometimes has one of its sequels in away ruins the trilogy and another which makes the trilogy look great. For example I would consider star wars a great trilogy despite I wasn't to crazy about Star Wars (**), The Empire Strikes Back (**1/2), and The Phantom Menace (**) but I loved Return of the Jedi (***1/2) which made star wars a great trilogy. In the Scream trilogy Scream (***), Scream 2 (***1/2) and Scream 3 are all great. The reason why this one was best was because it managed to be different, scarier, funnier, and more unpredictable than the others. Scream was scary and funny and not really too unpredictable. Scream 2 managed to have everything that Scream 3 had but Scream 3 was more exciting, and had some more awesome and cool gory killing scenes. I don't think another trilogy can be made to be as good as the Scream trilogy. Go see this movie 100 times and buy the whole Scream trilogy right away when it comes out on video. ****[4 out of 4]",Scream 3

And I must say, I did love it and it has become my favourite scream. All cast were brilliant and did well. Of course, the plot was original and I loved every second. And Wes Craven has done it again.

Therefore, despite the fact that I'm a fan, I'd have to be very impressed by this third edition or else I wouldn't feel Wes Craven did it justice. I was very impressed.This movie was not just a feeble attempt to make more money on the same hit storyline. This movie had a new and innovative plot and was definitely the final chapter in a trilogy.

It was great how this movie summed up the whole thing and brought you back to where it all started and touched on the original, base plot of the movie.  The 3rd movie was very EEERRIEE, unlike the the first 2 which was just fright and horror.  This had a few Nightmare on Elm Street-ish scenes, and made you feel a different form of fright.....those who saw it, know what I'm referring to.I DID expect something at the end of the movie, that DIDN'T happen...and I was little bit disappointed, but none the less, it was a GREAT movie!

If you are a fan you must (and probably will) see it in the theater. I saw the 11pm showing opening night after having watched the first two again, and I'd bet a large portion of the packed theater had also. The atmosphere was awesome; much yelling when portions of the first two were related. The scene at the movie set was the best--the more so, I think, the more you've seen the first.

What I like about this movie is that you never know who is on the other end of the phone, you could never tell if it's the real person talking to you. Like David Arquette said in the film,"" How do I know if you are the real Gale? Isn't it what the killer would say?"" Forgive me for not being very accurate, but roughly he meant that. This kind of crank calls really raised the tension throughout the movie.Neve Campbell , again, fought the obsessive guy in the end. And she's getting smarter( bullet-proof vest, yeah baby) and possibly stronger, too. The bit where they played the video is just SOOOO unnecessary.I mean, if Sidney really got killed, than it's not bad to have that bit added. But hello? Sidney can't die in THIS movie. And she won't.

This movie was very good, and the new characters and previous characters were all better in this movie. The storyline of Scream 3 is better then Scream 1 and 2.Scream 1 was very average and i say that this movie is fit to be a TV movie; it's just too small for theatres. There isn't much action in this film and the storyline (even though not very good) is better in lines then in teleplay. Also Rose McGowen is annoying in this movie and once her character was dead i said inside THANK GOD.Scream 2 was neither good or bad, but still better than Scream 1. This movie is fit for theatres but the way the movie was written was not good enough.Scream 3 was the best. I guess the way the movie was written is very good. Also the truth about Sidney's mother in this movie is way darker and cooler then the other stories about Sidney's mother back in Scream 1.

290,Allan-14,Theater Mints,9,8 January 2000,"Just to clear up those rumors... Unfortunate news has it that the outline originally penned by writer Kevin Williamson for Scream 3 was rejected completely by director Wes Craven & company in favor of a completely original screenplay written by little-known Ehren Kruger.
To me this is an injustice. The filmmakers should have waited for Williamson to have the time to write a full script instead of rushing into production as they did. Sure, we get the same tired excuses, such as the scheduling conflicts of the stars and the increasing demand for higher salary, but the fact is, the Scream saga was originally planned as a trilogy by writer Williamson. Craven, gifted though he may be, did not create Scream. He was merely an interpretor.
Scream 3 may turn out to be fun and perhaps even ""good"" if Kruger and Craven are lucky, but all it can be viewed as is a sequel- no more, no less. With this kind of deal who is to stop Dimension from pursuing a Scream 4, 5, and 6? Scream was hatched by Kevin Williamson, and Scream 2 was the second act to it. Scream 3 will not be the third act; at best and in true definition it can only be described as the mint you are handed by the theater clerk on the way out of the movie.",Scream 3
291,Allan-14,The next Godfather Part III,9,5 February 2000,"I wrote an earlier comment on ""Scream 3,"" and was rather harsh on the film without having seen it- simply based on the fact that the story was not written by ""Scream"" creator Kevin Williamson. So, I was surprised more than anyone how much I enjoyed ""Scream 3,"" the third and final chapter in the ""Scream Trilogy."" Indeed, I loved the first two and was always in anticipation of the third, but the fact that Williamson was not an integral part of writing ""Scream 3"" sounded to me like the nail in the coffin.
I was disturbed early on by the news that Ehren Kruger would be writing ""Scream 3"" instead of Williamson, less because of Kruger's talents than the fact that ""Scream"" was Williamson's vision and his trilogy. People greatly undervalue how difficult it is to write a GOOD slasher film, i.e. something above the likes of ""Halloween 5."" Kruger has, miraculously, pulled it off. A big mistake a lot of people make is that they think ""Scream 2"" and ""Scream 3"" are sequels. They are not. The three films are really meant to be a trilogy, and just like Randy (Jamie Kennedy) pointed out in the second film, a trilogy is inherently not subject to the same criticisms alotted to sequels. Sequels are cash cows, made for making $, whereas the obligation with continuations of ""Star Wars"" and ""Scream"" is strictly creative, regardless of public opinion. Some of Williamson's crucial ideas for the ""Scream 3"" outline, such as the making of a film within-a-film, were fortunately able to survive through Kruger's script, thus completing the ""Scream"" saga rightfully. Also, while I did enjoy ""Scream 2"" immensely, I did feel that at the end Williamson was becoming a little desperate for ideas. I would sincerely doubt that he could have pulled off the major twist ending Kruger did at the end featured in ""Scream 3."" The killer revealed at the finale of ""S3"" ties everything together, not just within the film itself but the trilogy as a whole.
Perhaps the performances in ""Scream 3"" are not above-par. While Neve Campbell actually does elevate Sidney into a changed person, David and Courtney Cox Arquette do leave a bit to be desired. Dewey is less of a dim-wit than before, which may fit into the whole ""advance the characters"" thing, but he was much more enjoyable as the Gump cop he played in the first two. And the Gale Weathers hair-do has got to go! Her hair was good in the first, and went downhill from there. Despite such shortcomings, ""Scream 3"" does manage to put itself alongside the first two in terms of quality. I imagine the following for this chapter will be much like that for ""The Godfather Part III."" It has a lot of detractors but I thought that was a great film too. What made both ""G-3"" and ""S-3"" work so well was that they realized that anything new introduced in the final act must be minimal, and that everything introduced in the first and second films' events must come full circle. For contrast, just look at how poorly the concept of a ""final act"" is handled in an actual all-out sequel: in ""Alien 3,"" the prequel-survivors crashland, ALL die in the film, and all because there was another alien stowaway (recycled from the original). What a waste of 135+ minutes of screentime in ""Aliens"" of developing these characters only to knock most of them off without any mercy in the first few minutes of ""Alien 3!""
In ""Scream 3,"" we are not just given another serial killer, there IS a backstory that absolutely ties very neatly into the first film, and by the last shot of the movie, we know that ""Scream"" is finished. Of course, this is the art form in which sequels have been made to ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Psycho,"" so what's to stop the FIRST ""Scream"" sequel from being made? Now that would NOT be my favorite scary movie...",Scream 3
292,Movman,A sliding scale,5,8 February 2000,I loved Scream.  I appreciated Scream 2.  I was entertained by Scream 3.  As this series goes on each one gets worse than the previous.  The second movie was comprised of some really creative scary scenes but overall lacked the continuity of the first movie.  The third movie is nothing but a collection of death scenes none of which are as creative as in the previous two films. Both sequels fail as a movie because of their focus on the scenes rather than the big picture.  Still when rating horror movies you have to be more lenient because of what is out there.  Scream is one of the few movies that has attracted a budget and a cast.  So I am glad that it is making money because I like horror movies and if we could get good people working on them the genre would improve.  Instead we usually get garbage and when you make a real good horror movie it usually gets put into the drama section like Silence of the Lambs or Psycho.  So it was not the greatest movie but I was entertained.,Scream 3
293,mmc123,Fair enough.,9,6 February 2000,"Well After I saw the original Scream I loved it and couldn't wait to see Scream 2.  Scream 2 wasn't all that good.  I went to see the end of the trilogy Scream 3 on opening night and had mixed feelings.First of all I loved the opening scene and how we first are introduced to the killer.  It is swift like Scream and way better than Scream 2.The characters weve come to know and love are forgotten in this installment except Sidney who seems to have some human side.  The comedy is extreme which I never expected but liked.  I really enjoyed the movie for the most part other than that.The ending was a surprise and wrapped up the trilogy but not as well as I expected.  They ""left the door open"" for Scream 4 and if they make it I will go see it as well.",Scream 3
294,MovieCritic33-6,Scream 3,10,9 October 2011,"Wes Craven's third instalment is just as powerful as any of the other entries. Many fans of the franchise and many critics have poorly overlooked this underrated entry, and quite possibly because it was the work of another writer Ehren Kruger. I believe most people shot it down before it even got a chance to get off the ground because Kevin Williamson's name was not under writer.As usual David Arquette (Dwight 'Dewey' Riley), Neve Campbell (Sidney Prescott), Courtney Cox-Arquette (Gale Weathers), and Liev Schreiber (Cotton Weary) all return to reprise their roles and deliver solid performances.Although not all of the following characters were given much screen time, the same credit should also be attributed to the new co-stars of the franchise: Kelly Rutherford (Christine Hamilton), Patrick Dempsey (Detective Mark Kincaid), Scott Foley (Roman Bridger), Lance Henriksen (John Milton), Deon Richmond (Tyson Fox), Matt Keeslar (Tom Prinze, Jenny McCarthy (Sarah Darling), Emily Mortimer (Angelina Tyler), Parker Posey (Jennifer Jolie), and Patrick Warburton (Steven Stone). Call many of them only two dimensional characters if you want, but I frankly did not see a difference in character development between the characters of Scream 2 and the ones from Scream 3. Of course by this film, you as an audience and/or fan of the series should know that there is a ""very simple formula"" to quote Jamie Kennedy's character Randy Meeks, who also happens to make a cameo (not a ridiculous cameo either, considering the eccentricity of the character) in this chapter via a home video titled ""Scary Movies 101"" to introduce the rules of a trilogy. If you know the Scream movies than you know it has to have the signature opening prelude before the film's opening title sequence. From then on it follows the same formula of the first two quite similarly, a bad thing? No, not for this viewer at least. Otherwise why call it a Scream movie? The only thing viewers and fans of the series may feel a bit of a disappointment with, is the producers call to have toned down the violence and play up on the humour in the series. The humour was a hit for me, but could be a miss for others. The tone of Scream 3 is much lighter on some levels with the bloodshed being mild and not as excessive. The scares are still there and the film still achieves the same eerie effect of the first two successors, however in an entirely different style. This sudden change in tone may not go over well with most viewers. Ehren Kruger does an excellent job as screenwriter, creating a very witty script (if you pay real close attention). This may have also been a reason for its panned reviews, because viewers were watching the movie rather than listening. Several real life incidences were what called for a drastic change in tone for Scream 3, and it is interesting when you look at each Scream film and notice how it is changed to adapt to its specific ""era"".Of course all predecessors are on some level a sequel, Scream 3 is still the ""trilogy"" Randy deems it to be, mostly linking it back to the plot of Scream with only subtle references to Scream 2. Any plot holes that were left ambiguous in the first film are explained. The climax in Scream 3 is one of the most well developed conclusions to its genre, and leaves the ""trilogy?"" on a satisfying note.Do not underestimate this film until you see it, it is still everything Scream and Scream 2 are but with a fresh approach to the franchise. If you loved the originality of the first film don't bother seeking originality from any of its sequels, the originality has already been done, a sequel only has an underlying originality built from a previous original idea. But I guarantee you it is not the very thing the original Scream set out to make fun of, everything in Scream 3 is intentional and intelligently thought out. Scream 3 is haunting and comical, with its superb score (used very chillingly as Sidney returns to ""Woodsboro""), its uncanny ambiances, and its satirical approach to Hollywood politics, actors and films. Pay close attention and you may think twice before panning this film.-MovieCritic33-6",Scream 3

Wes Craven did an perfect job by closing this trilogy. It's scarier, bigger and better than the two first films. I was a little worried that Kevin Williamson did not write this movie but this new screenwriter did a great job (maybe better than Williamson) by writing this movie ! And the end....wow!!!! It is so unpredictable and breathless !!! What a way to close the best horror movies/trilogy of all time !!! I give it *****+*/***** and it's one of my all time favorite ! Great job Wes !",Scream 3
297,kurtman-3,fabulous,9,5 February 2000,This movie was amazing.  I just saw it tonight and trust me wes cravens still got it.  The plot was great and so was the killer. I knew it would be good but I didn't think it would be this good.  The only bad thing is that this is the last Scream.  Their probably will be another made but Neve or Courtney or David probably won't be in it so it really won't be Scream.  This is one of only a few horror franchises to keep at least one main character in all 3 movies.  They are Scream and without them Scream will never be the same.  I gave Scream 3 a 9 out of 10.,Scream 3
298,doctor_dolittle,Eh... You can't win 'em all,8,4 February 2000,"Being a loyal fan to the ""Scream"" franchise (as short as it may be) I of course was eager to see this movie. Not bad, but not in the same vein as the ""Scream"" franchise. What we have here is horror/comedy ghost-masked as a psychological thriller. Interesting concept, but could have had so much more done with it. This could have been one hell of a thriller if it did not have so many expendable characters or twists & turns that run into dead ends. Not to say this is a bad movie. I only wish it would have gone in a different direction toward the end.I love how Sidney's character has really matured as a real person would. Secluded... paranoid... a bit crazy? Hell, if I'd been through all the crap she's been through, I'd definitely feel a little nutty. Another wonderful sub-plot to the story was the digging back to the past and the entire Maureen Prescott revisit. If the ""Scream 3"" would have focused more in these particular areas, we could have come up with one of the finest suspense films of the decade (despite the decade just starting). But, eh, whatcha gonna do? Another nice touch was how the film chose to spoof the ""Scream"" series itself instead of coming out with the same predictable jokes about slasher films in general.Dewey Riley and Gale Weathers are just as enjoyable as ever. Sexual tension just under their hostile exterior. So suspicious, yet so likeable. Two great characters dumbed down just a bit for humor's sake.Overall, probably not the best film you'll see this year, but definitely something to watch for entertainment. Great direction, mostly wonderful performances, a nice storyline, and a pretty good ending. B average. 8/10.",Scream 3
299,john-mitchell77,Third of the Trilogy Loses Steam,6,10 November 2016,"The main reason I thought Scream was so good was the way it played with fans' expectations. It said 'Here's what usually happens in the genre, and here's what we're going to do'. Sometimes that was to totally subvert a genre convention and sometimes it was to follow one, having first pointing out that it was one. I thought it added a lot of humour to the film, as well as being very clever. With Scream 2 we got more subversion and more of a kind of knowing wink, which was delicious. With the third, imaginatively titled Scream 3, we got something that appears to going somewhere new and interesting, but soon became a little run-of-the-mill and very predictable. In short, it turned into the very kind of stuff that the original and the follow-up were lampooning. OK, there are moments in this which are worth a giggle, but I wasn't rubbing my hands together with delight at how clever it was, as I had done with the first two. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that, as the movie progresses, it gets sillier and more contrived. It pains me to say it, having loved the first two, but, the trilogy ends, not on a high, how it should have, but rather fizzles out.",Scream 3
300,X2Nightcrawler,"Awsome, Awsome, Awsome",9,10 September 2001,"Well i first rented Scream 3 on DVD at Price Copper and the DVD was messed-ed, and all i watched was the 1st half of the movie, and i wanted to finish it, so i rented it again from Showtime.  I was luck and the DVd wasn't messed-up.I watched the whole movie, and was on the edge of my seat, cause by the Trailor when it says all rules can be broken i didn't know if Neve Campbell or David Arquette or Country Cox Arquette where gonna die, and i ain't gonna tell you.  But this is one great movie trilogy.for the longest time i never wanted to watch Scream cause i never liked horror movies, then one night i was thinking, ""what the hell, why not?"" so i put it into my VCR and watched, and when i say the begining of Scream with the girl (ain't gonna tell you who, incase you haven't watched it) was hanging from the tree, I stop the movie.  I though that the move was gonna get a lot more bloody!Well 2 years later, after people talk about all 3 of the Screams, i dicide to watch it, but i started watching it at noon, in the light, not the dark. And I was surprised, it wasn't as bloody as i thought, and before having watched ""Scary Movie"", I knew kinda what was gonna happen!  Well i liked the first Scream, and so i kept the tape playing cause we recored Scream 2 after it.  After i watched both, I really wanted to watch the third, because ""Scream"" is not anything like ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""It"", or ""Needful Things"" whihc had a crazy blood scenes to what i saw.  The Scream movies are like Mysteries, with Swearing, and Blood.  They also have Comedy, special in the third one, which they did i little too much.  But if you are not into Scary movies to much, just like me, and think ""Scream"" is really scary, well you are wrong, go watch it, the first part is really scary but that's really the most blood you will see!",Scream 3

I only knew that if they were going to do that they would need the masterminds behind the first two, Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson. When I heard Craven returned I was relieved, but sad to hear that Williamson didn't who was replaced by new writer Ehren Krugar. I didn't know what to expect from this film, but I thought it was well-done. The movie offers a good plot now that Sidney Prescott has someone targeting her again who knows about her mother's ""secret"" past. In the end, I was amazed at the storyline and was happy with the overall result. The movie is good, and I just hope they don't decide to make a Scream 4. At least they are claiming its the last and ending the films now on a happy note. Scream 3 is a worthy horror film.",Scream 3
303,aro-2,"Almost matches the original, but falls short...",5,4 February 2000,"Sid, still recovering from her traumatic past, hides away in a remote cabin working as a call-in phone counselor. Meanwhile, back in LA, another sequel to the ""Stab"" films is being produced. Murders begin to occur, eventually bringing together the survivors of the previous films. As with the other two, this one begins with a long sequence of the killer stalking his first victims. The lucky couple this time is Cotton Weary and his girlfriend. Anything beyond this would spoil the development.Truth be told, I really enjoyed this. However, I did have a few problems with it. It's almost too serious. The in-jokes and other self-referential material all but ceases after the first third. Without that, it's really nothing more than a slasher flick. The other is, as with part two, there's very little that will actually scare you.On the good side, it's fun. The acting is acceptable, the dialogue is intelligent(most of the time), and the set pieces are great. One of ""Scream 3""'s best scenes is a videotaped tutorial(Scary Movie 101) by Randy. Listening to him describe the differences between an ordinary sequel and the last chapter of a trilogy was a great idea. Then again, it wouldn't be right to have someone else taking his place as the resident film buff. Then, of course, there are the numerous chase scenes and even a chance for some special effects. In a slasher flick, how often do you get to blow up a house? The mansion provides an awesome place for the final confrontation. The best scares in the film(though not used to full effect) were Sid's encounters with her dead mother. There's always the fun of watching for references to other films, too. I can't be sure, but the position of Angelina's body and the way Wes filmed it as she was dragged out of view reminded me an awful lot of Tina in ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", as did the sheet-covered body as it stood before Sid(in the recreation of her house).After it was all over, I was satisfied with the way the ""Scream"" trilogy had ended(though I still prefer ""Alien 3""), so they'd better not make another one.",Scream 3
304,screamking_99,"The 3rd and Final Chapter of the Trilogy that Made Me Laugh, and Made me SCREAM!!!",10,25 March 2000,"I am probably one the the BIGGEST 'SCREAM' fans put on this earth, and when i found out there was going to be a 'SCREAM 3' in late '98 i went crazy! When i got the internet, i was on every scream-trilogy website i could find, i would visit them everyday. Seeing that i'm from Australia, i knew i was going to get the movie later than the americans, which kind of bugged me! So after the movie came out, i had really high expectations of the film, and this is what i got... Firstly, i was DYING (so to speak :) to find out who the opening victim(s) were, and when i did see who it/ they were, i thought, ""yeah why not"" at least it gave me a scare or 2, but i thought that Craven would get someone ""new"", but it wasn't a total loss. When i saw all the actors in the movie, i was thinking, ""like, seriously, if the body count is gonna be bigger, how are we gonna ""connect"" with the new characters like we did in the first 2 movies?"" and i was right, we could not connect with them, which kinda got me angry! the death scenes were a bit too quick with not (if any) enough blood in them. In my opinion all the wrong people died. i couldn't wait for Jenny McCarthy's Cameo, and that's all it was, a cameo! when they revealed the ending, i was so... (i can't swear) it was the dumbest of the trilogy, but the motive was good. but the killer(s) were 100% un-guessable! Also when the killer kept on disappearing from every killing, i thought was exaggerated! One of my favorite scenes i the movie is when the big explosion happens, that was very exciting for me!!! the scares kept on coming, even though you knew that the killer was going to pop up, i still got scared, which is VERY rare for me. All in all, this movie is VERY entertaining, and i would recommend it for anyone who likes a good scare, it's not AS perfect as the first one but still one of the best. i give this film a very good 8/10. (some of that goes to Parker Posey, who is a BABE!!!)",Scream 3
305,android_9999,The worst of the triology,2,10 September 2000,"I must admit.  I love Scream, and I absolutely love Scream 2, however, Scream 3 is a major disappointment.Scream and Scream 2 are good because they poke fun at traditional horror movies and break all rules; however, Scream 3 feels and tastes like just a traditional horror movie.I am very disappointed by it.  One untraditional thing about this movie is that instead of tying up all the loose ends and gives the audience a sense of completion, this movie does little in that direction.Out of 4 stars, I give it 1",Scream 3

All three movies are the same. A new ghost-face killer is on the loose on the movie set 'Stab 3' , a parody of the original ""Scream"" story. As usual the gang is all here, & they of course are the only ones who can get the baddie. The only highlight of this movie is genre favorite Lance Henriksen. The younger 'Dawson's Creek' audience won't know who he is, but then again, they will be the ones who like this movie.",Scream 3

Ruin some of the fascination of the ending. I swear. I'm nowhere near the only one who thinks this way.The first Scream should have, for this, and even generally, remained the only Scream. In my opinion it was and is a classic film that needed no sequels but even though it got them it doesn't lose too much of it's greatness - unless you watch this third part.'Scream 3' makers know the thing has gotten old and try to make this movie ""good"" by strongly pointing at Sidney's mother to bring something ""new"" but in my opinion, they fail. That seems only desperate effort to me. This part's killer's motive is way far fetched as is it's character completely. It's a useless character with useless motive.This film was even generally poorly made. They had almost ran out of new ideas and some scenes really seemed more like a parody or a comedy when I suppose they were supposed to be ""exciting"".I gave this ""3"" only because this has some characters with the same actors from the first Scream (Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox and even someone well-loved character shows up for a time.) I loved them all as characters and their actors, so it earns 1 point for the vote.The rest 2 I give for the ONE scene in this movie that actually was effective and well-done. It points to Sidney's past and to the original killer in a fascinating way.So there you go. Remember, I still say - if you loved the plot and the motives of th killer in the first Scream, please, do NOT watch ""Scream 3"". They may have made it work in a way but it takes so much away from the first part's idea and is anyway useless.SCREAM should have never become a trilogy.",Scream 3
308,zza99tmk,don't bother,4,20 April 2000,"To be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect from ""Scream 3"". I found the first enjoyable and if it wasn't for the over-acting of Matthew Lillard and the unsatisfactory ending as a whole, I would have even said that the first ""Scream"" is a really good horror flick. The opening sequence with Drew Barrymore is one of the scariest scenes I've ever, ever seen. That said, I hated ""Scream 2"". I hated it so much that first I didn't want to see the third part at all. Now to ""Scream 3"": I'll do it without a plot synopsis now, all you need to know is that the script by Krueger (by the way, why is everyone bemoaning the fact that Kevin Williamson was not involved in the making of S3? Williamsons script for the second one was -to put it politely - impoverished; yet I'm somehow curious to see his directional debut ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle"" which is still to be released in the UK) includes in fact a lot of plot holes and  inplausibilities, but then also a few surprises. So there should have been more effort put into the story in general, but what actually disappoints me most about ""Scream 3"" is Wes Cravens direction. Even from lazy scripts you can make out an at least enjoyable thrill ride if you do it right and with enthusiasm for the thing. It seemed to me that Craven lost all interest in the trilogy and more engaged in making films with Meryl Streep and entering new territory. But that's just speculation: in the end ""Scream 3"" has far less suspense than hoped (well, there were, admittedly, two or three ""I nearly jumped out of my seat""- moments). So do we get at least some decent gore scenes? Er, no.(But then again, a film doesn't really need to be gory in order to be thrilling) I should also mention the very annoying score which ruins every possible development of tension, the only moody piece of music was, as always, Nick Caves ""Red Right Hand"". What can I say in favour of the movie? Neve Campell is ravishing to look at, Parker Poseys obsession with being Gail Weathers (it goes like ""I'll follow you whereever you go so that I don't get killed"") and of course the gorgeous scene with the knife. Is that enough? To me, it wasn't (though it was still slightly better than the totally botched second one). As it often goes with trilogies: the sequels never match the achievement of the first part...

The plotline is familiar, yet the movie does contain some fun. Two different cameo appearances gave me a chuckle, so these alone were almost worth the price of the movie.  I'm not going to reveal who these cameos are, but if you've been to some one star was made famous in the 70's while another duo is a youth pop culture favorite of the 90's. The style of the movie is familiar, and why not. Scream 3 is directed by Wes Craven, so it has the same feel and rhythm of the other two Scream movies.  Fortunately, the movie has three of the main surviving characters returning, which adds to the fun of the film. There's also a nice video return of a character who doesn't live past the first sequel.  It explains the rules for the final chapters of trilogies--but this movie doesn't follow all these rules... Does that mean that this is NOT a trilogy?  Literally, and symbolicly the door is left open in the final shot.

Worst of all,neither Gale,nor Dewey,nor Sidney die!Call me cruel,but this excruciatingly formula movie could have used it.All during the length of the movie,I begged for a surprise,a neat twist-anything!To no avail.It's just a dumbed down version of scream(a not too smart movie itself,as it only serves to point out VERY obvious slasher movie conventions!)without that movie's suspence and scares(few that there were after the famous opening with Drew Barrymore). And of course the killer could be anyone-the butler,the cook,the best friend,the neighbor.It's the luck of the draw.No clues are ever given as to who it could be-and of course when we finally find out whodunit,the movie inevitably looses the meager credibility it had to begin with,as none of the dastard's behavaior prior to his unmasking make any sense when put in context.

I intentionally did not read or listen to any reviews before I saw it and I am glad. I will say, however, that this is an excellent horror film and it closes the door on the best horror movie franchise ever.Scream3 has the same feel and look as the first two Scream movies. It is funny, fast-paced and remarkably scarey. Although the first Scream is the best, Scream3 succeeds where Scream2 failed. It is believable and the ending is not totally lame. It is actually kind of cool and follows the ""rules"" of the trilogy as put forth by Randy the movie geek who makes a beyond the grave appearance. All our favorite characters are back from the first two movies; Randy, as mentioned, Sydney (Neve Campbell), Dewey (David Arquette) and Gail (Courtney Cox). They are joined this time around by Jenny McCarthy, Patrick Dempsey, and Scott Foley among others and you will be kept guessing who the killer is and why s/he is killing right up until the final revelation.If you like horror movies and, particularly if you like the Scream movies, go see this as soon as you can.

315,Covey-3,Fitting end to trilogy,10,9 May 2000,"OK. In all honesty, this film has been unfairly criticised by most people. In my opinion, the film is a fitting end to the genius of the trilogy. (Here's hoping that Craven doesn't find a good enough script).The story is tried and tested. Anyone who criticises the film based around the plot needs their head examining and their logic questioning as the Scream franchise was always, quite openly, conceived as a trilogy. So, fitting it is, that we return to the theory of the original idea, the reason that the story exists in the first place, and place it in a location ironic, yet relevant to what the film is sending up, i.e the movies. By locating the film in Los Angeles, the capital of the film world, we are subjected to a fitting backdrop for the characters to weave their tale.As with the other films in the trilogy, the genius doesn't lie in the story, but in the continuity of its characters, instead of having to fear a familiar villain (Halloween's Michael Myers, Friday the 13th's Jason, etc.) we are forced to identify and care about the vulnerable targets, the characters, the victims. By the third film, we almost feel like we know these characters. We can sympathise with Sydney's psychological trauma's due to her Mothers death. We can forgive Gale's shallow yet single minded and coldness and we can wallow in Dewey's idiocy and often unintentional, innocent boyish humour. These are characters we care deeply about because we have rooted for them before and won. The supporting cast, as in Scream and Scream 2 do an able job of maintaining our attention on the story, while also forging out their own identities in the short screen time they know they will have.Overall, this is a more than fitting end to what, hopefully, will later be recognised as the most genre defining trilogy of all time.",Scream 3

The most obvious suspects are actors in the movie but with most of them dying there is no way of telling who the killer is. Sidney again seems to be wanted for dead once more by the killer but can she survive this trilogy and will she come face to face with the new ghost-face.The trilogy answers questions that run through the head from the original like who really killed Sidney's mother.

Of course, it wasn't nearly as good as the first, but as sequels go, it was pretty good. So, last night was the opening night for Scream 3, and you can bet I was in line expecting a lot but knowing it might not deliver. Well, I pretty much got what I expected and thats okay. No, the movie does not come near to ranking with Scream 1 but sequels never do. But I would say it was on par with Scream 2. It still had a clever, sarcastic sense of humor, and some genuine tension, excitement, scares, and memorable scenes. Some of the disappointing aspects of the film were that there really was no ""bets are off"" types scenarios or surprises in the movie. Even though the killer was a surprise and the how and why of it all, the ending was just rather weak for the final showdown of trilogy that is supposed tie up all the ends and give you, what you would think should be a really BIG, all out, not necessarily happy ending.

Check.Even the Have-Randy-Meeks-explain-the-rules-of-the-movie-to-us ingredient is here, despite the scripting challenge of having the late Randy come back from the dead. Personally I loved the way they wrote this one in. Obviously, not all the rules are forgotten.
Not that the movie doesn't have it's moments of originality. In fact it has several. The movie is rife with  moments when you think the characters are in danger but they're not, and of course with moments when you think they're safe but they're REALLY not.Far more common however are the elements that would have been boring and predictable had they been in another movie line, but for some reason come off smelling like a rose here. I think there's an odd form of originality in this movie. Most of the horror-slasher clichés that the first two movies spent so much time tearing down are now resurrected. Many have critiqued this as ""being in a rut"" and falling in line with other slashers, and perhaps they're right. But it comes off as surprising and unexpected since the audience was never counting on a Scream movie to act like a regular cut-'em-up.Example? The ""stalking the girl in the shower and butchering her either in or just after she gets out"" bit has been done so many times, you'd think we were done with it. Screams 1 and 2 were so unconventional that I didn't expect the writers of 3 to touch it with a 10-foot pole. They did. Just as some animals can be so-ugly-they're-beautiful I thought Ehren Kruger's script was so-cliché-it-was-original. I choose to believe that was the point, rather then an accident.All and all, I say it was a good movie, and this is from a person who doesn't watch many horror movies. Scream 3 is a worthy ending point for the genre and if the packed theater I was in last night is any indication, it'll make it big.",Scream 3
321,cyberbat,Utterly predictable nonscream movie,6,25 March 2000,"This movie is very predictable, I kept predicting what would happen all through the movie and 90% of the time I was right!The first one was marginally scary...the second the same....but this movie lets the down the whole trilogy.I was expecting more suspence, gore and scares, but instead I was given a slow movie with little suprises.Yes admitadly a few people in the audience  and screamed but I certaily didn't.However it is still enjoyable entertainment and is funny in parts.My pet peive was that they had to pick such a loathsome person/character for the woman who played an actor impersonating the journlist woman (Dewy's girlfriend).
MINOR SPOILER ALERT (depending on your own oppinions)I was not impressed with finding out who the killer was in the end..it should have been someone else. I thought from the start it was her mother and I was actually disapointed at finding out it wasn't her...pity and it would have been even better if they killed off all of the 3 main characters as well.I give this 6/10 stars <..>",Scream 3

Her past comes back to her when the cast of a horror movie based on some local murders starts being murdered, and she is haunted one again.Though I enjoyed the cornball horror of the original ""Scream"", the second one wasn't as good, and the third was just crap.  The ending was sad, though the whole story sucks.  Sure, it may be an OK, though corny, premise for a movie or trilogy, but how many damn movies can be stretched out from one concept.  Aside from some suspenseful moments, a few funny ones, and great gore, special effects, and a brilliant hard rock soundtrack, the cast and crew of ""Scream 3"" did clearly not put as much effort into this one as the original, or even the second ""Scream"".The original ""Scream"", released back in 1996, resurected the teen slasher genre from the 70s and 80s.  Long after ""Friday The 13th"", ""Halloween"", and ""The NIghtmare On Elm Street"" were first viewed and exploded into long serieses, a whole new breed of teen slasher movies gave teen actors work. Even ""Halloween"" and ""Friday The 13th"" have new movies coming out this year (""Halloween: The Homecoming"" and ""Jason X"").  The plethora of teen stars such as Jennifer Love Hewitt exploded in such movies as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Urban Legend"".  As long as crappy sequels are being made, what is to look forward to in this genre.  ""Scream"" was a guilty pleasure, but now with crap like this, ""Urban Legends 2"" coming out, what is there to look forward to.  ""The Forsaken"" and ""Dracula 2000"" didn't fare to well at the box office.  Neither did ""Valentine"", but ""Jeepers Creepers"" did okay. While I have heard good things about ""Thirteen Ghosts"", how much different could it be then the others.  ""Halloween"" and ""Friday The 13th"" were good, but they spawned so many sequels that the originals are just forgotten.  I guess the Snoop Dogg vehicle ""Bones"" is different, it is a ghettofied horror flick, bu this was just not worth seeing.  See it only if there is nothing else to rent.My Rating: 4 .5 out of 10 or C",Scream 3
324,livealot,Broke The Rules,4,24 June 2003,"SPOILERS - READ WITH CAUTIONWhile this movie claimed to not follow any rule, there was still one big general rule that really should have been followed - as pointed out by Randy Meeks (who makes an appearance via a recording filmed before his death), at the end of a trilogy, ALL BETS ARE OFF. A main character (a.k.a someone from the original) should die. There will be more blood, more gore, more excitement and a killer ending. This is no ordinary sequel. But of course, Scream 3 fails to fire in these areas.It doesn't match up to the first 2 with their wit, thrills and quality. What we get instead is a product that doesn't really excite and leaves the viewer yawning. The ending was far-fetched and in all honesty is rather stupid and had me shaking my head. Some moments were good. A variety of cameos were worth a smile and so was Jamie Kennedy's video recording. Overall, could of done better. 5/10",Scream 3

I was pleasantly surprised, not because I found it scary, but because it was entertaining enough for me to like it. This time, I didn't figure out who the killer/killers was/were, unlike last time, where it was just so obvious that it was sad. That which makes the film work despite not being the least bit scary is that many times it's funny. Very funny. Especially the gab between Courtney Cox and Parker Posey (who gives the by far best performance in the film, by the way). It features a bunch of neat cameos and in-jokes that kept me entertained throughout, but let's hope this is the last film. Let the franchise come to an end before it's too late. Give this a go though. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but at least it's entertaining and well shot/edited/acted. And that's good enough for me.",Scream 3
327,draftyrafters,Not too shabby,8,13 February 2000,"Scream 3 is a good film.  Not great, but good.It certainly has a lot to live up to.  The original Scream, when it was first released, was a refreshing departure from the belabored and formulaic cesspool to which horror movies had long since relegated themselves. Mixing an array of tongue-in-cheek self-referential in-jokes with legitimate terror, the first installment of this multi-million dollar franchise revived a genre that had long since been condemned to movie history, buried alive by such cinematic c**p as Critters 3 and Leprechaun 4: In Space.  Never heard of those?  Not surprised.Unfortunately, the sequel, and even the third installment to some extent, threatened to collapse in upon itself.  Part of the charm of Scream was the way it mixed a clever hook (a horror movie that knows it's a horror movie) with some very simple, but plausibly disturbing murders and motives (or lack thereof).  Cashing in on the success of its predecessor, the makers of Scream 2 hastily jammed together a conglomeration of dying college students with some shaky logic, resulting in mediocre fare.  Although it has some great scenes (with the intro being one of the best and most ironic murder scenes out of all three installments), the second of the series seemed a bit too blood-happy.  ""See here?"" the makers seemed to be saying.  ""We're doing it again!  Isn't it great?""  And we smiled and said, ""Sorta.""Well, Scream 3 is a winner.  In fact, the worst that can be said for the flick is that its irony is often a bit forced, and it occasionally succumbs to the very cliches that it seems to mock.  Although it doesn't reach the crystal clear tones of the original, it takes the same old cast to some impressive heights.  The film is set on the set of Stab 3, a movie within the movie that is a fictional fictionalization of the actual murders in Screams 1 and 2, which are fictional to us, but not to the fictional makers of the Stab movies.  Following me?  Therefore, there are pretty much two of every cast member.  Courtney Cox, for example, plays Gale Weathers, while Parker Posey plays an actress playing Gale Weathers.  It's pretty cute.This gives the cast some artistic license, which adds to the humor and the tension of the script.  With the performances by Posey and David Arquette (as the somewhat annoying Deputy Riley) by far the best of the cast, Scream 3 boasts not only some believable fear, but it also has plot twists that aren't ludicrous for once.  Written by Ehren Kruger (the man responsible for the fabulous film Arlington Road), this final bow by the Scream movies is done gracefully and, thank God, unpredictably.Of course, there are some hitches.  The killer, for instance, takes two ice picks to the neck, one to the chest, a nicely carved and varnished Victorian table to the skull, and several vases to face, and he/she still comes off with barely a bruise.  Ah, but do we care?  Not that much, really. Although some of the movie trips a bit over moments of unnecessary complexity and melodrama, those moments are few and fleeting.  And although it can be said that the movie itself is not quite as substantial as the first, it is certainly a fitting and satisfying close to a franchise that never took itself too seriously to begin with.",Scream 3

329,j-kirby247,An Above Average Finish to an Epic Film Trilogy,7,26 March 2012,"Basic Story Guide: Spoiler Alert (once again I am forced to spoil a few things about the movie, I humbly apologize but it is unavoidable)The movie begins in Hollywood were Cotton Weary is set to do a cameo in the upcoming movie Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro. But on his way home, he receives a phone call from none other than Ghostface, demanding the where abouts of Sidney Prescott. After not disclosing her location, Ghostface kills both Cotten and his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Sidney Prescott, living in total isolation, works as a crisis counselor, and is absolutely terrified that the murders will resume. Her fears are well founded as she learns about the murder of Cotton Weary. Meanwhile, Gale Weathers is approached Detective Mark Kincaid to show her a new development, and a change in Ghostface's pattern: he left a photo at the murder scene of Cotton Weary of a young woman in her 20's. Gale recognizes the woman as none other than Maureen Prescott, Sidney's mother. Now, Sidney must confront not only the psychopath behind the mask, but a ghost of her own past, the woman she called mother. Verdict: The final chapter of the horror movie trilogy that breathed life back into the slasher genre during the 90's was labored during this movie. Not saying its bad, but it's like eating too much ice cream, tastes good the first time you eat it (Scream), it's even good when it goes down (Scream 2) but then it hurts so much (Scream 3). It's above average at best, but it does rely on tired clichés. And there is one part that just made me want to scream (no pun intended). It was just way out there and although it is nothing major, it's just one of those things that doesn't belong in Scream. (spoiler) Basically put, a house EXPLODES! Why in the name of Hades would a house explode in a horror movie? When you take into account that this a horror movie that prides itself on meta humor, bloody violence and the like. It's just a mild irritation but still the movie itself is pretty good overall. The killer's identity is a bit of a stretch, but not impossible. This movie mostly deals with Sidney putting the past with her mother to rest and coming to terms with her. If you are a die hard Scream fan (such as myself) you will like this movie, but it won't win over any non-converts. An above finish to this film trilogy...or, like Creed's song at the end asks, ""Is this the end for us my friends?""7/10",Scream 3
330,Steveo1986,More good acting talent would've made this a better scream,4,12 January 2006,"The Scream franchise bowed out rather badly after it could've done so in a good way after a not-exactly-brilliant but still fairly good series and humour which suited it surprisingly well in some parts. Yeah it was corny in places but at the end of the day, what horror film doesn't have at least a certain amount of corniness in it? Anyway, to the film; a great horror film idea that was marred by mediocre/unexperienced actors. The acting and script for me was a bit too sleazy. In fact, the only of the very good acting came from Neve Campbell as her heroine character Sydney Prescott, although David Arquette and Courtney Cox were alright. Fortunately Neve Campbell turned down her role for Scream 4 (great decision; she deserves better than the likes of this and Churchill:Hollywood Years). One person sadly missed from this film is Jaime Kennedy, and his video appearance in this film was one of very few good parts of it. They made a near-grave mistake by killing Randy off in the second film. I felt that he would've bought more light to this film. He and Matthew Lillard were brilliant in providing pretty much all of the comedy in Scream 1. Some good comedy moments and quotes came from him in Scream 2, helping to keep it above average until his murder. The best thing about this film was the plot. It had more of than the first two Screams (which were pretty much same, even though the murders in Scream 2 were a bit more random). Although even that had a couple or so flaws, like the part where Billy may not have killed Sydney's mother, which was a fairly misleading and confusing. The whole Gale-Dewey affair was typically sleazy and fairly unoriginal, so tying those ends would've made a basically flawless script. The special-voice changer was a great idea and good twist to the storyline. The way that the 'Stab 3' characters get literally killed off in the order they're supposed to on the script. Another good thing was that the killer was someone of the least of people you'd expect it to be. All in all, too much mediocre acting, a fairly sleazy script and no Randy brought this film down and Scream 4 shouldn't be put into the question. Only if Neve Campbell and Jaime Kennedy was in it, but they haven't so on the realistic side the Scream franchise should remain cancelled off here.",Scream 3

Still, you can't dismiss that it's a good ol' slasher movie with enough killing, gore to satisfy. It never chills you (save one scene with Randy on videotape) quite like the 6th Sense and TBWP but it gets the job done (but why does the killer have everyone's voices?).

332,S.A.B.,You've Seen It All Before,5,12 February 2000,"The original SCREAM may have been smart and suspenseful, with neat references to the slasher films of the early 1980s, but it is quite obvious that this latest installment is just another stupid, though mildly entertaining, teeny-kill flick tailor-made for the non-discriminating 16-year-old. The plot of SCREAM 3 concerns Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and the other survivors of the first two films, who end up in Hollywood on the set of STAB 3, a film based on the events of SCREAM 2. Not surprisingly, they are stalked by a mysterious killer.This is barely a horror film. Much of it plays like an inept black comedy such as TEACHING MRS. TINGLE, complete with annoying cardboard-cutout characters spewing out mindless dialogue. Campbell (in the few scenes she's in) and Patrick Dempsey take their roles seriously, and they turn in good performances. The other cast members play it strictly for laughs and give uninspired performances. As dumb as the film is, it is fairly watchable. The stalk-and-slash sequences are fairly well-directed by old pro Wes Craven, and there are some fun cameo appearances. However, if you've seen SCREAM or the slasher films of the early 1980s that it parodied, there isn't anything here that you haven't seen before.** out of ****",Scream 3
333,will51224,A great finale to an outstanding trilogy!,7,24 July 2001,"OK, let me start by saying that Scream 3 is definitely the worst of the series.  However, that doesn't make it horrible overall, considering that the first two were phenomenal and this script unfortunately wasn't written by Kevin Williamson.  The violence was toned down WAY too much, and on top of that, the death scenes were very uncreative.  Almost everyone died the same way: a knife in the lower back.  I was particularly disappointed with the opening death scene.  First of all, the choice of characters to kill was very poor, since we already knew one of them.  The actor that played him isn't even that well-known either, and that's what one of the best things about the first two films' opening scenes was.  Seeing Drew Barrymore, Omar Epps, and Jada Pinkett die in the first scene was completely shocking. This opener just didn't have that same effect.  Also, many of the characters were very one-dimensional.Alright, enough on the negatives - now I'll focus on the good things about this movie (surprisingly, there were many).  Although this movie was not very scary, Ehren Kruger, who took Williamson's place on this one, was able to make it very action-packed and came out with a decent thriller, only because Wes Craven returned as director.  This was also by far the funniest of the Scream movies.  I enjoyed the clever dialogue between Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox - who by the way looked TERRIBLE in this!  My God, her hair! I don't get it!  She looked so hot in the second one!) and Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey - the funniest character in the film) who is playing Gale in Stab 3.  David Arquette is funny once again as Dewey, and Neve Campbell rocks reprising her role as Sidney.  I also loved the part where Randy (Jamie Kennedy) explained the rules of a trilogy on a video.  Everyone else - Jenny McCarthy, Scott Foley, Patrick Dempsey, etc. - were all great as well.Another fantastic part of this movie was the fact that the mystery was not just simply ""who is the killer?"".  It was more complex than that - it involved ""how is the killer related to the 'back story'?"".  The killer would leave a photo of Sid's mom after each murder, and that built up to the very clever identity of the killer at the end.  This is what makes me believe that it's a really great finale to the trilogy because it concludes the story so well.Although it has its flaws and it's not quite as enjoyable as the first two, it's not as bad as it may seem.  I found it to be fairly disappointing, despite the fact that it was fun to see at the movies, because i waited over two years to see it, and i couldn't help but expect something spectacular after hearing countless rumors about how well they kept the script and everything under raps.  But I saw it again on video and realized how well it concludes the story.  It's very entertaining - not as much as the first two - but still a can't-miss for fans of the series nontheless. 8/10",Scream 3

I don't care what anyone says; how cheesy these films were, how lacking the plot was, to me they're just good plain fun.  This film, however, was the worst of the 3, although the story that unfolds in the end is interesting.  The way this film brought itself back to the events of the first was very clever.  Courtney, David, and Neve of course pull rank as everyone else falls in line behind their shadows, but this trilogy was always about them to begin with.  This movie would have been so much better had Kevin Williamson written the script. That's the only beef I have with this film.  Kevin, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? You took the time to write the first and second one, yet you were somehow too busy to do this one?  I would think you would consider this trilogy as your baby, that you would want to do it justice... but I am obviously proven wrong.  The concluding chapter of a trilogy is typically the most important, where everything comes to an end, good or bad.  The way the storyline climaxes was pure genius, but it just falls short somewhere... the writing was just choppy and it was very evident this was not written by Williamson.

One of the best sequels to any horror film.Scream 3 (final act): Not as scary as 1 & 2, decent, could have been better.Alright, as I said Scream 1 & 2 were amazing and scary. Now Scream 3... kinda rushed a few things. They went into killing right away. Cotton Weary who was the big hero at the end of Scream 2, was killed off way to early. Now we have Sidney Presscott who is staying hidden up in California, living under a different name and is a ""Crisis hot line operator"". I felt like Sidney's role wasn't that big, because she didn't really have any scary fights besides the end, like she had a lot of those in a lot more scenes in Scream & Scream 2. The murders were too predictable, but the only best part of the film is the end of knowing how these horrific events of Sidney's life have happened. Kevin Williamson should have wrote Scream 3.

339,Zalman666,Piece of crap!,1,4 June 2003,"I don't know what sucked about this movie the most. Everything about this movie was a huge disappointment. After falling in love with her in such illustrious comedies like House of Yes, Waiting for Guffman, and Best in Show, Parker Posey's acting was at an all time low in this movie. While I was being thoroughly disgusted with this rag, I kept thinking: ""She went from The Daytrippers to this."" Also, Courteney Cox's costume designer and hair stylist should have been fired. Granted that her character Gale Weathers was still nothing more than a ""tabloid twit,"" she did not look the part of someone determined to win the Pulitzer Prize. Despite the fact that Neve Campbell has never been a first rate actress, she does well enough playing someone still troubled by her past. But what was probably the most disappointing aspect of the entire movie was the identity of the killer. Not to give it away, but I remember wishing it wasn't so when the movie came to it's long-overdue ending. The things that make Scream 3 bad can probably be attributed mainly to the fact that Kevin Williamson didn't write the screenplay like he did the first two. However, the most redeeming part of this movie was Jenny McCarthy who provided a line that reinstated the Scream trilogy was meant to be a parody of horror movies. She put it nicely when she said: ""I'm thirty years old and you keep sending me in to play teenagers."" Too bad that alone doesn't make this movie worth a rental fee.",Scream 3

It's not horrible, or even bad.  Just not very effective.  Seems like Wes lost his passion for the material.  The new characters are under developed, and all but two of the horror sequences are uninspired.  I partly saw this because I wanted to see if it could be pulled off; to see if I could guess the killer(s) and his/her motive.  Answer is...no, because, I thought to myself, that's too stupid for him/her/it/them to do it!  And the motive made the killers at the end of two look completely believable.

The only thing this installment shares with part two is, a very silly ending.  Why do I get the feeling that the only reason could possibly like part two about part three is because it's the newest thing.

342,ScaryBoy,What's your favorite scary movie TRILOGY?,10,11 February 2000,"***May contain minor spoilers, but nothing outright*** Words cannot begin to describe how perfectly this film works in wrapping up all the plot details, and bringing the series to a full close. For those who whine and complain about the fact that the rules for the trilogy were ignored, THAT'S THE POINT! The trailers and everything said, ""Forget the rules."" And they did - they outlined the rules and then broke them. On to the performances - Neve Campbell was wonderful here. For all of us who have come along with her for the entire series, it was heartbreaking to see her finally totally break down after the confrontation on the Stab 3 set in her ""house"", and inspiring to see her finally have built up the strength to face the killer (or -ers) after everything she's been through. Courteney and David were great together and separately, with Parker Posey adding wonderful support as the Gale Weathers clone. She provides some of the biggest laughs this time around. I loved how they brought back Sid's dad in that one scene, and Billy's dad too, in the footage in the finale. They were both played by the same actors as in the first, making it even more realistic. And bringing the actress whose picture sat in for Maureen Prescott in 1 and 2 into the movie to play her ghost was very inspired. Add to that Liev Schrieber and Jamie Kennedy, and the gang's all back for the final act. And who would have thought that a line like ""Would you be willing to settle for a PG-13 relationship?"" would bring on such nostalgia? Ha ha! The grand finale works so well. It's wonderful to watch. And even though the killer is hard to foresee, he or she or they still make(s) perfect sense. What is so great about this film is seeing the little things from the series addressed such as, will anyone Sidney is friends with ever survive to see the closing credits? The finale addresses this question big time, with the fates of several characters resting in Sidney's hands and finally giving her the ability to prevent their deaths, an ability she was never given in the first two films. And the final scene wraps up everything so perfectly and sweetly, with the very last minutes just perfectly handled, leaving us with the perfect combination of closure and yet openness. I am a huge Scream fan, and this film lived up to all my expectations of how the series should end. Everyone in the cast did a superb job, however, I think that some of the actors with smaller parts should have been given more time to develop their characters (Deon Richmond, Matt Keeslar). However, everyone had at least one memorable bit, including some great cameos. (It's so cool that Jay and Silent Bob show up in this movie, seeing as how Kevin Williamson and Kevin Smith are my two favorite screenwriters.) In the overall scheme of things, this film was better than the second, but not as good as the original simply because it's NOT the original, nor do I think it was the intention to top the original. I think the filmmakers made the best movie they could, and even though Kevin didn't return and Ehren Kruger could never replace him, I think Wes and Neve and Courteney and David remained true to the spirit of the series, and kept things in the same perspective. I think it would be just fine to end the series with the third one. However, as you see in the final shot, they DID leave the door open . . . Hmmmmmmmmmmm. 10/10",Scream 3
343,junebug058,Wonderfully terrifying and absolutely hilarious! **SPOILERS**,10,12 February 2000,"I absolutely loved the opening scene with Cotton and Kristine! I also liked the way that after the opening scene it went right to Sydney and the story begins! Parker Posey, Jenny McCarthy, Scott Foley, Emily Mortimer, and Kelly Rutherford really give this film flavor. I would also like to give praise to Roger Jackson for doing the voice because he did a wonderful job too. The Arquettes and Sydney played their parts well. My only complaint is Courtney's hair!! The ending was terrific too. I was so surprised when I found out Sydney had a brother, and even more surprised when I found out it was Roman Bridger. I recommend this film to anybody who likes horror movies(the Scream series imparticular)! You won't be disappointed. My grade: 8 out of 10. GO SEE IT IF YOU HAVEN'T YET!",Scream 3

And the next victim is: He who smells the gas? BOOM! If you haven't seen this movie, you probably have no idea what I just wrote. But if you see this movie, you will. If you like the Scream franchise, you might like the humor they threw into it. Anyway it was pretty good and worth the money I spent to see it. I give it a B.",Scream 3

This film is like the first sequel to Scream and was obviously made for money only. There is no passion, no invention, and all the cast members play awfully.

350,David Fick,(6/10) Third Scream movie fine - but loses the edge of its predecessors,6,23 April 2000,"Scream 3 is the much anticipated sequel to Scream and Scream 2, bringing the trilogy to a satisfying close.  What is missing, though, is the freshness of its predecessors and Scream 3 almost seems like a rehash of what we have seen before.  Of course, we haven't and the average audience member will still have difficulty in guessing the identity of the murderer.As far as plot is concerned, we are back in familiar territory with someone charging around in mask and cape, with a telephone to torment his/her victims before stabbing them.  For the details, go see the film - I'd rather not spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet.Neve Campbell returns as Sidney, but her character has been softened incredibly.  Although Sidney is still capable of delivering the goods when she needs to, she has basically withdrawn from life in the outside world. Campbell is, as usual, lovely as this tortured young woman but should now look for something to stretch her considerable talents as an actress.  David Arquette and Courtney Cox Arquette are also back as Dewey and Gale Weathers, and it's good to see Jamie Campbell back as Randy - albeit only in a video flashback.  New and notable to the Scream movies is Parker Posey who walks away with the film as the actress who is playing Gale in the latest ""Stab"" movie.  Also of interest are the cameos by Jay and Silent Bob (of the Kevin Smith films Clerks, Mallrats etc) and Carrie Fisher as the archive secretary, Bianca Burnett.Scream 3 does stand on its own feet.  It has some great moments of tension and one amazing twist at the end - so go and be scared before someone tells you the end!",Scream 3
351,GregJayC,A film to see AND a film to miss...,10,25 April 2000,"I must admit, that like everyone else, I was extremely excited about seeing Scream 3. And I had every right to be, living in the United Kingdom and subsequently having to wait three months.Anyway, the film did NOT disappoint my expectations. Yet it did not exceed them. Scream 3 was definitely suffering from multiple genre syndrome. It simply did not fit neatly into any category. Allow me to explain.For all you absolute gore-loving horror fans out there, this movie will be a big disappointment. Very little blood and relatively tame violence (by today's standards) make this a walk in the park compared to, let's say, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I know that's an old example, but hey...If you are the type who prefers more of a psychological thriller, for example, Silence of the Lambs, then you will probably love Scream 3. The truth is, it DOES provide plenty of scares and shocks. But they are all implied, a la Blair Witch. So as a thriller, it really works.Then again, if you are a Poirot-loving, Columbo-watching mystery fanatic, who loves to solve obscure crimes, don't bother with Scream 3. I HATE whodunnits, yet figured out the mystery sub-plot after an hour. OK, so I picked the wrong person/people, but that's not the point. So if you are the kind who guesses murderers after five minutes, avoid it like the plague.But, as always, Scream 3 does have another saving grace: its humour/humor (notice that little trans-Atlantic touch?). The film is packed full of jokes, sly references to celebrities, nods to the audience about horror films, etc, etc. Not to mention a couple of excellent cameos. It's a good film to see if you like comedy. Sort of like... well, there is nothing to compare it to. Dewey is absolutely hilarious.For me personally, the film did end up a touch contrived. I was absolutely hooked for the first hour or so. As soon as the ""Final Act"" began, it got silly. When they have to resort to killing off four characters in the space of twenty minutes, you know something is wrong.I don't think there will ever be a Scream 4. I don't want there to be. I don't even want there to be a Halloween H20-type reunion in twenty years time. It was a nice series while it lasted, but it's gone now.This film is the final one of a trilogy that managed to create a whole new genre. Scream was excellent. Scream 2 was good. Scream 3 has an excellent cast, a good premise, and a bad ending.To sum up:If you love HORROR, catch it on video. If you love THRILLERS, see it, it's excellent. If you love MYSTERY, read a book instead. If you love COMEDY, this one's a hoot. If you love SCREAM, see it, but with a fresh perspective. If you love RANDY, then you've probably seen it already. :)",Scream 3
352,Mojo-Jojo,"Not bad, not bad at all.",7,8 February 2000,"Sticking with a straight review so as not to reveal anything, I will say that of the 2 sequels, this was the best. Although not written by Kevin Williamson, it was still smart and hip - as critics might say. I didn't know Williamson didn't write it till the credits at the end. As for the ""scare factor"", I was shivering more because the theatre was set at 50 degrees. Seriously though, it isn't anymore or less scary than the first two. I must say overall it was a good movie. To comment on the acting, I would say that it was impressive. The 'Scream' francise is of the horror genre after all.",Scream 3
353,cvrana,"very sleek, stylish, and cool.",9,29 January 2000,"When I first heard about the script for Scream 3 I was a little nervous about it, it seamed a little weak.  But, when I finally saw the movie, I was blown away at how well they managed to pull it off!First of all, it's not the least bit corny, as I was expecting.  The movie is also very full of suspense.  This was a lot better than a lot of the other movies I've seen recently(Supernova, Eye of the Beholder, and Magnolia.)So, if you really want to see a cool movie, check out Scream  3.  You won't be disappointed with this one.",Scream 3
354,time_2_scream,Best movie ever!!!,10,26 May 2001,"After hearing such bad reviews for this film I wasn't really looking forward to this movie but once I saw it I was blown away.  The acting was great especially from Neve Campbell and the storyline was just as good if not better than the other two.  I thought that the way they decided to add more of a comical effect throughout the whole story worked well especially the relationship with Parker Posey and Courtney Cox Arquette was brilliant. But I do have to moan about: The way most deaths were killed in the same fashion,How Gale and Dewey totally ignored the rules that they had learnt,The unrealistic voice changerAnd..Spoiler next
The way you could tell who the killer was as it was the only one where you couldn't see the actual murder taking place. Overall I give it 9.6/10",Scream 3
355,LoveHurts01,The best in the trilogy!,10,25 October 2001,"Scream 3 is definitely the best in this trilogy! It is the funniest, scariest, and most entertaining out of the three. To me, the trilogy got better and better as it went along. The cast is top-notch! Neve Campbell (Sidney Prescott), David Arquette (Dewey Riley), Courtney Cox (Gale Weathers), Liev Schreiber (Cotton Weary), Roger L. Jackson (Phone Voice), Lynn McRee (Maureen Prescott), and Jamie Kennedy (Randy Meeks) all reprise their original roles. New stars include: Patrick Dempsey, Scott Foley, Parker Posey, Lance Henriksen, Jenny McCarthy, Deon Richmond, Matt Keeslar, Kelly Rutherford, Patrick Warburton, Heather Matarazzo, Josh Pais, and Carrie Fisher. Parker Posey gives one of the best performances in the entire trilogy! Her hyper, Gale-wannabe Jennifer is absolutely hilarious, which is not to say that the rest of the cast isn't incredible also!Once again, Wes Craven gives horror fans a movie to love!",Scream 3
356,isaiahc-72408,Didn't feel the same,7,29 July 2021,"I really liked the intro to this movie, but from there on out it was pretty bland. The whole storyline of the killer trying to find Sid was weird and why? The kills were not that good either. Ghostface wasn't as interesting and fun in this one and is he is in the past ones. The final scenes between the killer and Sid, Gale, Dewey, etc., were not cool and it felt like it dragged on for way too long. Dewey and Gales constant fighting was annoying, and they really didn't do anything in the end. I did like the twists that occurred though. I incorrectly guessed who the killer was too and I was surprised to find out who it was.",Scream 3
357,silverfish,A good ending to the trilogy,7,30 October 2001,"After Scream 2, I wasn't sure what to expect in Scream 3.  Scream 2 was disappointing, but this film is much better, and perhaps better than the original was.  There seems to be a change of tone in this film, with quite a few earie moments, as well as the quick shocks of the other 2 films.   
Also, being the last part of a trilogy, there is some of a development of the plot of the original film.  Thus the plot seems to be more developed than the other two films.  There are  number of plot elements that are included but then seem to be ignored later on, but mostly the plot is well written, and more focused than the others.This is well worth watching if you liked Scream, even if you were disappointed by Scream 2.",Scream 3

363,urban_legend,"Great, but lacks the power of the first two.",9,19 March 2001,"Let me just start off by saying that you can totally tell that Kevin Williamson did NOT write this third installment of the trilogy.  Each scene lacked whatever it was that Mr. Williamson put into the others.  The killer was quite predictable, they seemed to skip right over everything that happened in SCREAM 2 (except for the frat letters Sidney still wore around her neck) and a majority of the characters were simply there to be killed off, there was no point to them in the story.  It was still enjoyable, but not as much as the previous two.  I would like to see the Gale and Dewey characters in another film, however.  Maybe a romantic comedy??",Scream 3

365,M-46,Even a 'One' is way too much credit for this movie.,1,14 April 2000,"First I have to say I never saw part I and II of Scream. That was one of the reasons to find out whether or not the movie was any good.The movie started and it was immediately clear there was no story line at all. Scream 3 referred too much to the previous two parts. The script is flawed, for instance: After 3 murders, a girl says ""two people are already dead""! In combination with lousy acting, I have to conclude: Even a 'One' is way too much credit for this movie. If there would be a prize for worst movie ever, they would not even consider Scream 3, for it's ghastly. There should be a severe penalty (think in the category of death) for making such a movie. It was a waste of my money, I should sue Wes Craven.",Scream 3

367,gbjazz1,A brilliant underrated ending to a great trilogy 8/10,8,12 January 2008,"Scream 3. Starring Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox Arquette.After the original Scream (1996) Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson continued the story into a disappointing Scream 2 (1997). After that I wasn't sure about Scream 3. But, I went to see it and I was amazed.Scream 3 is brilliant. All the surviving characters are back (Even a video recording of Randy (Jamie Kennedy) who died in Scream 2) This time they are in Hollywood filming ""Stab 3"" the second sequel based on the events of the 1st and 2nd scream movies. Sidney Prescott (Campbell) is living under a new name in a isolated house. But she gets a call from someone with a familiar voice: ""Hello Sidney"". While that is happening ex-cop Dewey Riley (Arquette) is working on the set of Stab 3, and after a couple of deaths (and a series of clues to Sidneys mother's death) reporter Gale Weathers (Cox Arquette) shows up. When Sidney arrives they decide to try and find him.The suspense is still there, great dialogue, good humour and great special effects (especially on some of the death scenes). If you liked Scream and Scream 2, you must watch this, it ties up all of the unanswered questions that all fans will be asking.I know this can never live up to the original Scream. But it is definitely better than Scream 2. If you're a fan, watch it. If you haven't seen the other two movies first, watch them, then this one.8/10",Scream 3

369,mgm-14,Disappointing!!!!!,5,22 February 2005,"Scream 3 started out well but when it came to the climax it fizzled as once more the writer used one of Hollywoods worn out reasons for murder, mommy loved you best!!! Oh please. Couldn't they have been a bit more original? Couldn't they have used anything but that one. I saw it coming a mile off and yet was hoping that I was wrong. Sorry I wasn't wrong. Then the actual ending was bogus too. There were two killers in both Scream 1 and 2 but not in 3. In my mind here is how it should have ended. Dewey and Gail do there little engagement scene and disappear into the house. Sid comes up with the dog and walks into the kitchen closes the door and proceeds to the living room where she finds Dewey and Gail butchered. As the look of shock floods her face we see Ghost Face appear in front of her and we hear that familiar voice say, ""Hello Sidney, we always comes in two's remember?"" and with that he or she leaps onto Sid and stabs her to death, roll credits............ That would have been the perfect ending at least after the bogus, brother didn't get mommies love and had to kill mommy and all of little sisters friends. Ho Hum!!!!!!!!!! I guess we the public can't have everything.",Scream 3
370,hartje,Go. Enjoy. But don't think too much.,6,6 February 2000,"Scream 3 was slickly put together, but was all over the place. I'm not talking about the usual misdirection, of which there is plenty. It just seemed scattered.The usual cast of survivors are once again brought together by murders that are apparently following the script of Stab 3, which is currently in production. Did anyone really try to follow the script to figure out who would be killed next? Well ... no. But that was explained away quickly.Once again, we are treated to people who insist on splitting up whenever possible to explore the darkest of corners, including Sydney, who has been living sort of like a recluse in the hills. You would think she would be a little brighter by now after living in such fear. Speaking of which, she is also haunted by the spectre of her dead mother in this film. Or is she?Finally, the conclusion leaves MUCH to be desired, including the fact that it is totally inadequate in explaining how certain things could have taken place had the murderer(s) actually been the only one(s) involved in the murders. Certain things simply don't add up. Some of the new characters were simply added just so there would be people to kill instead of the primary players throughout the flick.The best things about this movie were the cameos. Carrie Fischer, Jenny McCarthy (don't worry, she isn't on-screen long enough to annoy you with her special brand of mental retardation), and Jay and Silent Bob.Overall, though, I would recommend this flick for Scream fans, or just basic horror fans. I didn't take the movie seriously, although I didn't find that it resolved as well in the end as the previous two seemed to. You don't go to these movies to have something to discuss over latte and croissants anyway. You don't even really go to be scared. They're just fun, with perhaps the occasional fright, and this one is no exception.Go. Enjoy. But don't think too much.(2/4)",Scream 3
371,todge169,A fantastic finale(possible spoilers),10,11 May 2000,"In 1997, I saw a movie that changed my opinion of horror.  That movie was Scream.  I had never liked horror.  I mean did watch a couple of Freddy Krueger films and thought they were pretty good but never really got into horror until I saw Scream.  I knew from the minute I saw the trailer for the first one that it was something special and because it came from Wes Craven(A Nightmare On Elm Street) I had to see it.  I was completely blown away by it's brilliance.  I only had to wait a year for the sequel and again thought it was brilliant.  You can imagine how high my expectations were when I heard there was a third one coming out that was going to finish the series  This time I had to wait two years but it was well worth it.  Scream 3 takes place in Hollywood two years after Scream 2.  Sidney is living in isolation in Northern California and her whereabouts are only know by her long time friend Dewey.  However she is forced out of hiding when the cast of Stab 3 are being killed off and she receives a phone call from the new killer.  I was really surprized how well this finished the trilogy.  The violence seemed to have been toned down some but it don't spoil my enjoyment and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I can see why they don't want to do anymore because this really makes it a complete story with all the loose ends wrapped up and it delivers a satisfying ending.  I was a little concerned when I heard Kevin Williamson(the creator of the series)wouldn't be writing this one but my concerns were premature.  This film has many funny moments in it and it is nice to see that the four main surviving characters(Sidney, Gale, Dewey and Cotton)are brought back by the cast members who play them to finish off the series.  This film seems to put a twist on everything from the first two and has many clever moments not least the reappearence of film geek Randy(Jamie Kennedy) who was offed in the second film(I won't spoil how he is brought back)and the scene in which Sidney is persued by the killer in a reconstruction of her Woodsborough house on the set of Stab 3.  This film also has nice cameo by Lawrence Hecht who plays Sidney's father. All in all this film is a brilliant, clever, funny and scary conclusion to a terrifying, hilarious and original horror series which is undoubtedly one of the best horror series of all time.  I really do hope there are nore.  There was talk of them doing a Halloween H20 type situation with the Scream series but I think this film is the Scream series equivilent to that.",Scream 3

By the time it was released there were so many imitations, I for one was burnt out on slasher movies.  But, this one is an improvement over #2, and definitely better than most slasher movies get by the time the second sequel rolls around.  The only real downfall here is the cast can't seem to hide their knowledge of being in a popular hit movie, and the corniest most contrived ending in the series.  This time around, I didn't care who the killer was because no one other than the regulars was on screen enough to create any suspicion.",Scream 3

I've never seen any concluding movie in a series go full circle and wrap the story up as perfect as Scream 3 did.
I loved diving into the backstory of the first one. Was like a sequel combined with prequel.
Lot's of fun. Loved the supporting cast too. Parker Posey was great as Jennifer Jolie.
And I was glad they moved away from that teen soap opera feel.
The opening was the 2nd most intense of the series.
Dewey, Gale, Sidney, and Cotton were great as always!I wish Scream 4 was as good as the first 3. It was terrible and the box office really showed it.",Scream 3

Although Scream 3 was not bad, it can't really be put on the same level as the other two movies.First of all I did not like the idea of the movie being based on the set of Stab 3, the third installment of the movies based on the Woodsboro murders. The acting was awful besides the normal people Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette. The story did have a good twist, but it did not feel like Scream to me. I will admit, it might be one of the scariest of the four movies, but it reminded me of just a regular horror flick. It bothered me that Ghostface used the peoples voices instead of the normal ghost face voice. That is just one example of how the movie bothered me.All in all I still enjoyed this movie. Not as much as the other three but this movie was still good. If you like Scream you will like this movie, but if you don't like Scream then you will hate it.My Final Review: 7 out of 10",Scream 3

And scary, too, though not quite topping the Sarah Michelle Gellar or Drew Barrymore scenes of yore. If you liked the old Screams, you'll like this one.

I was amazed, a horror film, that was a send-up of all the horror films from my past, on purpose, but it was something more.  It was fun, frightening, and so damned clever. A film that took a dead (yet again, no pun intended) industry, and turned it into something new and fresh, and began a string of horrible rip-offs.  The second ""Scream"" film fell into it's own storm it created. ""Scream 2"" was still better than 99% of the horror films that were released since the original, but it still echoed ""Scream"".  Now in 2000, 3 years since our last 'Scream' (pun intended) we have the long awaited final episode to the Trilogy.  All remaining main characters return in this dark, revealing, violent final act.  Scream 3 cleans up a lot of the mess and gives us the bang for our buck.  Every secret is out of the box, and we don't know who it is until the last moments.  Neve is better than she's been in the first two films, her acting is flat, but here there is more range. Arquette and Cox are wonderful as usual, but the rest of the new cast leaves little to be desired.  Most of the supporting characters are killed off before we even know there names.  The only other complaint was the first hour of the film drug a little too much.  I will not let any more out, for respect of other true fans.  I give this film a final rating of a 7.",Scream 3
378,Krusty-14,Thank god it's finally over,4,13 February 2000,"Let me start by saying that i loved Scream (the original) and OWN all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.  That said...The REAL ""rules"" of horror trilogies1. Most of the movie will be spent reminding us of past characters and actions, and basically just recapping movies we have already seen, thus wasting our time instead of adding something to the storyline.2.The stars, once considered talented and promising, will have receded into utterly terrible actors (Neve Campbell, David Arquette), or will sport a new look that is absolutely ugly and ridiculous (Courtney Cox-Arquette).3. The lack of a true plot will be obscured by unnecessary profanity (basically every line of script) and not-so-funny humor in an attempt to make an otherwise boring movie entertaining.  Also, by trying to obscure the lines between fantasy and reality, the writers must make the plot into a muddy and indecipherable mess that even Einstein couldn't figure out.4.  The plot will just rehash previous plots (Scream 1 and 2) or even plots from other series (Wes' New Nightmare).  In addition, the ending must be so out of the blue, that nobody could have even imagined it, no matter how closely he watched the movie.5. Pop-culture icons must make distinct and pointless cameos to increase the ""entertainment value"".6. Innovations (like the phone call, voice disguising, and the scary mask and knife) will be merely imitated.  No creativity should be put into the new film.7.Wes Craven will take a once-brilliant idea and run it into the ground until it makes us sick with disgust (a la the Nightmare series).THE BOTTOM LINE: This trilogy should have stopped at a single movie. Scream 3 became what the original sought to ridicule.  I can't believe I sat through this entire movie.  Wes, how could you do this to us?",Scream 3
379,jthebeatles,Scream 3...Not bad,5,10 July 2006,"This film is not bad at all really, I say it should have a higher mark than 5.3 out of 10 on IMDb because its not that bad. Its an average. I don't think its as good as the second as i think that Scream 2 is the best movie out of all the Scream series, but i think that this movie is just as good as the original. No better, No less but just the same. Its might be the last Scream movie in Series of Scream (the last films are usually the worst) but this i don't think is. Its not *PERFECT* but its not *BAD*. Like i said before i think this is an average. Me myself would give this a good ******* out of **********. I'm giving it a seven because its not as interesting as the second and the killer was very obvious.George: Age: 9",Scream 3
380,genedurham,Better Than Expected,8,30 April 2000,Scream 3 has so much secrecy surrounding it that many people had really high expectations for it. Which is why those people are disappointed by it. I honestly thought the film was well written and nicely acted. The characters of course are another story. Ehren Krueger obviously showed a weakness here. The new characters were poorly developed throughout the course of this film. With the exception of Parker Posey's Jennifer Jolie. But even her character development is limited. Scream 3 could have saved money by not including the useless characters. The plot is of course growing tiresome. The script is very good. The movie in all was better than I expected. I expected it to be very poor because it is of course a sequel. But it is worth your money and 2 hours and some odd minutes to view it.,Scream 3
381,conqueror6,ok,5,17 November 2000,"This movie was, in my opinion, a waste of film, however, if the scream movies was never concieved, and this movie still was made under a differnt name I think, that it may have been better. What did save this movie for me and alot of people was the fact that there was a lame movie being turned into another lame movie-Stab 3. HA! So, actually it was a good movie that got hurt because of the association with the first two.",Scream 3
382,Steal-No-Evol,Lance Henrikson bombness,8,5 June 2003,"Lance Henrikson is da man ~! and it's great to see him in this movie(for however short a part).  This time around the main characters do what the main characters have been doing the first two films and the killer keeps up his job too, except this time they don't have to worry about the muckymuck of Kevin Williamson's writing and into the oddertackier graces of Kruger's.Awesome sequel for Scream(s)",Scream 3
383,sirseef,Scream Without Its Soul,5,21 December 2010,"The final installment of the Scream trilogy is an unfortunate departure away from the first two in a couple of major ways, and all seem to stem from who wrote the script. Writing credits are given to Ehren Kruger (The Ring, Arlington Road) instead of franchise creator Kevin Williamson. This departure leads to all the others.The most noticeable difference is the characters. In the first two, the characters had a certain amount of depth, and were to be taken seriously even if they were a bit eccentric (ie. Randy Meeks, Dewey). Comedic elements came from these eccentricities and from situations that unfolded just as they do in the horror movies Randy discusses in the first two. In Scream 3, there is pretty much no character development whatsoever. So much so it's entirely possible to forget about characters all-together. Additionally, some of these characters are way over-the-top and would be more fit to be in Scary Movie than Scream 3. Another difference is there are several iconic links between the first two that are completely absent in the third. However, Scream 3 isn't a complete failure. The rules of the third are what they should be and the movie does a good job of sticking to that idea. The story in this sense is fitting as the final chapter in a trilogy, but ultimately, Kruger doesn't seem to quite get it. It's as if Scream 3 is an impostor - something like out of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It may look like Scream, and it tries to act like Scream, but it's not Scream - even if some casual passer-byers can't tell the difference. Thus Scream 3 lacks an identity and never figures out what kind of movie it is. Scream 3 seems in search for it's soul which is something it seems it cannot have without Kevin Williamson, even if Wes Craven is directing it.",Scream 3
384,rickr-3,Entertaining...and that's what counts!!!,8,4 February 2000,"Let me start by saying I really enjoyed this movie. NO...it was not the same as Scream 1...but it is NOT supposed to be. It was fun, entertaining, cheezy, funny...and some chills too. Now I must digress for a second and say, this movie belongs to Parker Posey. Her hilarious, over the top performance as a spoiled new age Hollywood star...as Gale Weathers....provides many of the best moments in the film. I have been a big fan of hers and I think this movie finally brings her immense comedic talents to a more main stream crowd. So...this may be brainless and cliche ridden...but you can not deny the entertaining fun of it.",Scream 3
385,LordDave,From one who saw Scream 2 and hated it,7,16 February 2000,"Disclaimer 1:  I have not seen Scream 1.  I did see Scream 2, and found it to be one of the lamest films I've ever seen.  All stab, no substance. Unlikeable, cranky characters (except Randy, who met an unfortunately early end) did not help much.Disclaimer 2:  There will be a *SPOILER* near the end of this commentary, clearly marked.  Watch out.I liked Scream 3.  I was VERY surprised at myself.  I was quite prepared to hate it, after my experience with the unscary, unfunny part 2.  I found this one to be humorous, suspenseful (the only kind of ""scary"" that ever gets to me... I like tense moments, not lots and lots of blood and stabbing), and charmingly melodramatic.  I laughed, I cried, I held my breath.  Well, I didn't cry, but Randy's post-humous scene did evoke some cheap emotion. The dynamic between the ""real"" people and their respective ""actors"" in Stab 3 was nicely done, although it could have been explored a tiny bit more. In summary, this movie was worthwhile.  I might actually be going back to see it again, less than a week after the first time, mostly for a few choice funny moments.*SPOILERS*One weird criticism:  At the end, when the killer revealed himself, I didn't know who it was.  Without his colorful wardrobe and distinctive glasses, I had to ask my companion.  Could be just me.  I don't see too well.My favorite part was probably when the knife was thrown at Dewey, and the handle hit him instead of the blade.  That was the defining point of the movie, in my opinion.  The audience held their collective breath, and let out a nice uproarious laugh as he tumbled down the stairs.  It was great. There were also some humorous moments with different characters telling each other to ""shut up"".",Scream 3
386,RichNice,Good end to a Great Trilogy.....,9,5 February 2000,"Where do I begin?  I really went into this movie thinking that it would be horrible.  Why?  No Randy, but to my surprise, the Scream crew more than made up for no Randy by having a humorous script, funny characters, and enough ""who dun it"" to keep everyone guessing.  Plus the cameos will in the movie make it also worth the price of admission (J&S.B.).  So trust me, if you enjoyed Scream 1 and was pissed at Scream 2, you'll luv Scream 3.Happy Screaming.",Scream 3
387,Palermo-3,Mediocre. Forgettable,5,12 June 2000,"There are three holy Wes Craven films: The Hills Have Eyes, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, and the original Scream. Rent them instead. Scream 3 doesn't have a single memorable death scene, and is about as anticlimactic a way to end a once energetic series as possible. Furthermore, the movie is too devoid of style to really have been directed by Wes Craven. It's an unknown secret in Hollywood that it was actually made by the second unit director of Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace. Neve Campbell plays a sadder, more cautious Sidney Prescott with surprising poignancy, but she barely redeems this slapped together effort. For undiscriminating genre fans only.",Scream 3
388,fogg98,The after-mint of a filling meal,6,4 April 2000,"If Scream was the sumptuous main course, Scream 2 the delicious dessert, then Scream 3 is the after dinner mint. Not as gratifying as what went before, however, a very satisfying way to round everything off. I recommend refreshing yourself with 1 and 2 and then catching a late session of 3, as it all adds to the experience (and helps with a bit of background knowledge.) All your favourites are back. Sidney - holed up in the hills, with her nightmares to keep her company. Gale - still the gung-ho, take no prisoners reporter. Cotton - now with his own talk show and Dewey - the lovable oaf who is now a technical adviser on 'Stab 3', around which, Scream 3 revolves. Events surrounding Stab 3 eventually bring together the main protagonists and introduces us to a crop of fresh faces including Parker Posey (Daytrippers), Emily Mortimer(Ghost and the Darkness), Scott Foley(Dawsons Creek), Patrick Dempsey(Mobsters) and Jenny McCarthy(Jenny.) Throw into the mix a couple of cameos by Carrie Fisher and Lance Henriksen and, excluding Jenny M. who is but mere eye-candy, you have a very talented cast. Although I never thought I'd say this about any Hollywood slasher-flick, I found myself wishing there was a little more graphic blood-letting. C'mon Wes, where was all the blood? I fear that events in the U.S.A. involving kids and schools and what not are spilling over into the film world and forcing the bigger players to tone down the violence. It's a shame as it does take away a little from the film, especially after the first two . However the grisly opening, the humour, the suspicion and the 'all-is-revealed' ending are all there and the film skips along at a great pace. Look out for the return of Randy in a great 'voice from beyond' scene. The in-jokes and tongue-in-cheek references have your head spinning for the first half and guarantees a repeat viewing when it comes out on video. For those of you going in fresh, enjoy what is a fun film     that still has you looking over your shoulder as you walk home. If you liked the Scream series, then check out the recent Aussie effort - Cut, with Molly Ringwald and Kylie. Overall, a 6/10 fun night out. Eat it up!",Scream 3
389,Threepwood,"I think I've seen this movie before. It was called ""Scream""",6,13 March 2000,"This movie has all the elements that have made the Scream franchise so successful: humor, self-mockery, metanarrative scenes (ask my English professor what that means), and a scary guy with a knife. The problem is, I've seen Scream. Scream 3 follows the old formula a bit too closely for my taste, almost to the point of repetitiveness. And what is the deal with Courtney Cox's haircut? Still, it was entertaining, and that is what most movies are all about. If you have the time, it is worth a look.",Scream 3
390,rob-437,Hello Sidney...,7,2 May 2000,"Scream 3 is a good film when it is viewed after and in context of the previous two films.  Don't go along expecting never-seen-before, new-ground-covered, horror/slasher movie.  It isn't.  What it does is to give some understanding to the whole movie trilogy, horror-genre thing and in this it succeeds very well.There are some clever moments, for example, when Sidney steps onto a very realistic set of Woodsboro.  The acting is as good the other two with most of the familiar faces being there in one form or another.The film sits well with the other two and it would be recommended to see the other two before seeing this to ensure that all the reference make sense (in trilogy style!).  Very stereotypical, but that's not to say it isn't entertaining.In the true spirit of a Trilogy not as good as the other two but when the rules laid out are applied it does make it a good film.  Also in true trilogy form can only ruined by a fourth (no films in particular being thought of!).  I think a relations dog could have a motif",Scream 3
391,northofcb,Well,7,9 October 2003,"This was a good horror movie, I will give it that. It was slightly original, which is rare in the realm of horrors, but it lacked the ""umph"" of its predecessors. Great acting, but lacked the well placed, but not over-done, gore of the originals.7/10",Scream 3
392,aclockworkorange22,Most Rubbish Wes Craven Film Ever!!!!!!!!,10,5 June 2003,This film was not a horror it sucked big time.

393,Kris19,not worth admission,3,4 February 2000,"In this horror trilogy that changed the genre forever, the final installment was a letdown.  True, it ended where it all began (literally), it did not have the magic that ""Scream"" had.  Of course, there was plenty of gore & violence in the movie, but the killings came to be very expected.  I, myself, am a dedicated Scream Trilogy fan, but I'm glad to see it end.  For those of you who haven't seen the movie, wait until it comes to video.",Scream 3
394,Lynn723,The Best Scream of All!!!!,10,5 February 2000,"I could not believe what I saw. The Scream series was great, and this was the best way to end it. I could not sit still. I was on the edge of my seat through it all. The ending was superb. I usually had the killers pegged before they were suspects in the others, but this I never saw coming. I have to give a large round of applause to Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven. They are truly the masters of horror. I only wish that Randy's warning could have become a reality. That would have made things complete, for real.",Scream 3
395,TyC,Praise for Scream 3,10,1 April 2000,"This movie finishes off the Scream trilogy very nicely, and clears up any questions you may have had about the first two.  The ending in this movie lets you know that everything is over for good.  The opening scene has to be the most ironic one to date.  I loved it how the actor playing Gail Weathers and the real Gail fought throughout the whole movie, it was so funny.  This is so far my favourite movie out of the trilogy (my old favourite was Scream 2 because of Sarah Michelle Gellar).  Well done to everyone involved in this trilogy.",Scream 3
396,Miranda-7,it should have been titled AWFUL!!,1,8 February 2000,"Very disappointing!! Not revealing the murderer would have been better. The murderer was not even believable. Bottom line--waste of talent on a terrible script and direction was blahhhhhhhhhhhh. Patrick Dempsey was good. Neve Campbell came across tired and that was great. As for Mr. Arquette and Ms. Cox, they should save their little eyes for one another off set and remember that they are characters in a movie.",Scream 3
397,Scott L.,This movie could have been a lot better!,7,7 February 2000,"I thought Scream 3 was a all right for a third installment but I was kind of disappointed with the way they wrapped up the trilogy. I thought they could have done better and made the killer's identity a little more shocking and surprising. The movie wasn't nearly as scary as the first two. I don't think I jumped once. Some of the new characters never seemed to develop and the end was kind of thrown at you all in a few minutes with nothing really building up towards it. This one just really didn't hold up to the creativity of the first two Screams, it was kind of like your basic horror flick.",Scream 3
398,spawn777,"Solid, satisfying ending to the trilogy",10,4 February 2000,"I was extraordinarily impressed with this movie, mainly due to the continuity displayed with the rest of the series despite the absence of the series creator, Kevin Williamson. Equally funny and scary, it was definitely a fit ending to the series. Aside from the main returning characters, Parker Posey and Patrick Dempsey stood out as excellent additions to a series that is unbelievably adept at snagging character actors that rise above their usual efforts. The story stretched further than the first movie, but it developed an excellent back-story to tie everything together and still remain self-referential. Randy's cameo was great, and definitely helped raise the stakes for the usual surprise ending. If only all fun movies could be made this rich.",Scream 3
399,santo316,The story ran dry,6,2 March 2000,The third installment of this movie was the same nonsense the second movie was. I have to admit I enjoyed the first scream; it was fresh and totally revived the horror movie genre. But the sequels where completely disappointing. Another thing about this movie was that the story they where trying to tell could have taken about 15 minutes instead we had to endure about 2 hours of it.,Scream 3
400,simono84,Good but not great.,7,28 March 2000,"I enjoyed Scream 3. It's the worst of the trilogy, but if it was a stand alone and was not compared to the other 2, it's a good movie. Jenny McCarthy is a bad actor, but I liked her in this. She had some funny lines. Parker Posey was great. Heather Matarazzo was annoying, and Patrick Dempsey was a little to serious. There were some good jump scenes as well as some very funny parts. But the revelation of the killer(s)... Well, there were no hints in the movie as to who it is. You can only guess who it is, so it wasn't that much of a whodunnit. I give Scream 3 86%.",Scream 3
401,tyhemp-2-2,"Three times the charm, the blood, and the personality",10,5 February 2000,"Did they disappoint us before?  They made sure they didn't this time. Scream 3 is just a great film.  Warning to any fans who have not seen this movie yet: This comment may contain some spoilers.  Fans of previous Scream films should gladly accept this third attempt as another worthy effort, but it is by no means better than the first.  It could be, but that just isn't the way horror movies work.  Always credit the first film with the most points.The setting and environment of Scream 3 is choice and inspiring.  Could see many horror films working this way.  Sidney's dark and eerie cabin in the woods (where she is hiding) provides for some very suspenseful moments.  A few ""visits"" lure Sidney out of hiding, out under the lights and cameras on the set of Stab 3 in Hollywood, and everything just gets better from there on out.  It never lets up.  New main characters include Posey and Dempsey, who provide top-notch performances with Parker Posey as the wannabe ""Gale"" who takes the whole murder mystery way too seriously and tries to annoy Gale by acting out her role as Gale, and Patrick Dempsey plays the perfect role of the suspecting cop who suspects too much and therefore makes himself a suspect.  The movie is funny, but yet really serious, and I have to say that I felt disturbed watching the characters die in this film.  That only happened once before with Tatum in the first Scream.  Well, in this Scream almost every death scene was disturbing for me.  The blood is there, lots, and I hate to say it but Scream 3 is actually more frightening than the previous two films in the trilogy.  The killer is almost like a ghost, a mistakable entity.  I could ""feel"" the killer's presence.Another plus in this film is the incredible use of bad lighting in the final scene.  Choice!  Go, Wes!  That's what we want.  You can't really see what is happening, but you know that something is.  You hear the knife blade. The fake studio scenes within the film provide perfect traps for some of the stumbling characters, and there is even a new phone-voice gadget that the new killer(s) use(s).  Wont tell ya what it is though.  I'll tell you, honestly, I haven't been really scared, and I mean FRIGHTENED-scared, by a film since the first Scream and possibly Halloween 666.  But Scream 3, it outdoes all of the nineties horror flicks.  No lie.  However, it does start off a bit cliche and a little lame, but it works well.But Scream 3 absolutely, positively, and intentionally never, ever stops scaring for the whole two hours.  In the previous two Scream films, the audience actually had time to contemplate the killer's(s) next moves, motives, and/or identities given the gaps of dying time between death scenes.  In Scream 3, the dying and the action almost never stops.  You won't get to suspect any of the characters because they drop like flies. But, please fans, take this movie seriously, but not TOO seriously.  It is a landmark compared to other horror genres and their third sequels.  Watch it with an open heart.  Let me spoil at least two things now:  Jamie Kennedy makes a cameo, and there is a very big secret shuffled into the trilogy very smoothly.  Also, there are so many red herrings and fancy plot twists in this film that by the end of the movie you will feel literally drained by it.  This movie had a personality, and it had class and style.  Stuff that the first Scream had that other horror films didn't, which makes Scream 3 a nicely made, different stretch from both films with a bit of its own flavor. Scream 3 on the BIG SCREEN is fresh on my mind right now from last night (fri 2/4) and all I can think about is going to see it again and again and again.Overall, there could be more to ask for out of it, but this works well enough.  If I would rate Scream with an 9.0 rating on the IMDb website, then Scream 3 should get at least an 8.5.  Three point deduction from Scream's rating for a little bit of bad acting, and a two point deduction for some poor casting choices.  Preferably, Jenny McCarthy.  Please, don't let her ruin the movie for you.  Her fate is obvious, just bare with it.  The acting/casting was good, don't get me wrong.  I wasn't able to get out of my seat for the whole duration of the film.  It's hypnotic.  I was so hyped to see this film and I wasn't let down one bit.  I won't talk about the ending in my review much cause I'm sure that some fans won't like it.  But it is still a great film.  For casual movie-goers, as well.Here's the crack down: Scream  -9   stars, A+ Scream 2-7.5 stars, B+ Scream 3-8.5 stars, A- for actingAnother spoiler, maybe.  One scene almost made me cry, and the ending of Scream 3 is seriously odd and eerie.  I mean the dead last shot, not the climax.  Never before has there been talk or suggestions of ghosts or entities in Scream, but the ending of this film makes for some pondering. Hmmm.  True fans always love another open door.Just remember.  All bets are off.",Scream 3
402,folie,Just an above average horror movie,6,5 February 2000,"I didn't find any of the stabbing scenes scary or gross and the characters just do stupid things, like not sticking together as they should.The motive was apparent half-way through, even though the killer could basically be anyone.  The identity is randomly assigned and I never suspect the 3 main characters or the black dude (if you guessed the motive...) or Parker Posey (who did a great job as a comic relief).  The motive is really contrived, though not as silly as in the 2nd one.  Take away the fun factor (thanks to Parker, various cameos and in-jokes), this is a very average & play-by-the-rules horror movie.  Sadly, it doesn't measure up to its two predecessors.  Since it didn't break any new rules, it's not a real trilogy as it claims in the movie.  Although the ending refers back to the first one, it's a so-so finale in my humble opinion.",Scream 3
403,bernie369,"A bitter sweet ending of a trilogy,",4,1 October 2005,"First of all I want to recommend everyone, who wants to watch this movie, that you watch Scream and Scream 2 before that one. You might understand the plot but I'm quite sure you won't see all the little cross references to the predecessors.There are many new characters in Scream 3 but of course the trio Sidney, Dewey and Gale is again on board. What I really liked in this movie was the idea to parody the characters and to make fun about their weaknesses. The ""original"" protagonists meet their pendants who act them in a movie called Stab 3. But as I said: I liked the IDEA. But what I didn't liked was the realisation. I see the Stab 3 actors more as a form of supply of victims being killed than new characters. They seem to me like targets, which somebody wants to shoot, than real persons.I expected the death scenes to be more cruel and more bloody but instead they made look more kindly. I just didn't like the way how it happened.What I liked was the fact that it was thrilling to guess who the murder is. I also liked the connection which is made to the very beginning of the Scream movies.It's a good final movie of a trilogy but it simply couldn't fulfil my expectations. Nevertheless I think if you liked the first two movies you have to see to complete the whole picture.",Scream 3
404,staggeredgenius7,"Not a spoof of slasher flicks, a spoof of The film world",9,12 August 2000,"While I do agree that this was probably the weakest installments of the best horror franchise in history, I say that the bashing that this film has received is ludicrous.  Every entry in the Scream trilogy has brought something original and unheard of to remove the  horror genre's staples. The first spoofed slasher flicks which upon the release of the Last Friday the 13th film had been eroded into a waste of film. Yet ""Scream"" maintained its own artistic credibility.  The second did the same with sequels and received the same result and critical praise.  Now the mystery, why was the 3rd so lambasted?  Was it because it took pot shots at the Hollywood mentality and hit too close to home.  We all know Hollywood has a way of milking the dough out of anything profitable even someone's own life ALA Sydney Prescott in the film series and OJ, Jon Benet, etc., in real life. Would a suit care about a person's feelings concerning an ordeal if the first installment of his/her story had grossed 100 million?  I don't  think so. When something is proved financially viable, the mainstream film industry has a way of beating it even after it is a dead horse and not caring who they hurt in the process.  Look at the horror franchise after ""Scream's release.  When one film is successful producers make a plethora of knock offs praying for the same affect, thus hurting the reputation of a definitive film and all involved with it. The actor's playing Hollywood moneygrubbers in the last installment of the trilogy make faces at the very people they are involved with every day; tabloid journalist's, hungry directors, starving actor's, womanizing producers.  The  effect is a quite satisfying portrayal of real show business. Was the film ripped apart due to its spoof of Post Columbine censorship? Many acts of violence in the film (fake knives and costumes) make a reference to the thick line between reality and fiction.Or did critics refuse to believe that a trilogy of sequels much less HORROR sequels still remain fresh after 4 years? Even the great films Psycho, Halloween, The Howling have never been able to successfully spin off a well made sequel (with the possible exception of Halloween H20 which still is not on a level with any of Scream's sequels).  It seems instead of being proud a once dead industry did something right and knew when to stop, critics had polemic views fueled by many awful memories of slasher sequels from the past.  In relation to the first two films Scream 3 is weak in the same sense that Armani is to Versache which is hardly a noticeable one.Following in the footsteps of its predecessors ""Scream 3"" continues with as much wit and believability as its siblings.  Kruegar's writing is on par with Williamson's, the acting has now been honed to an art, and the new players are as volatile and interesting as the survivors.   Its only flaws are the holes in the connections between the killers in all 3 films and a belated release.  I could have used this film at the end of 98 when nothing good was released until Christmas weekend.  If it had an earlier release date it would have probably been lauded and topped the 100 million mark as did parts I and II.  As it stands, it has earned its inclusion with ""American Psycho,"" ""My Dog Skip,"" ""Gladiator,"" and ""X-Men"" as the only ""Hollywood"" films of 2000 I have seen that are worthy.",Scream 3

I thought it was going to be terrible, just awful, boy was I wrong! Usually the third movie in a series is just plain bad, but this is pretty good. Not very scary, but still entertaining. Even if it's the worst one in the series it is still fairly average. Some parts are really dumb, and this one even has some comedy in it, but a slasher flick can definitely have some humor in it. No damage done. I knew it was going to be the worst one, but I didn't think it would be even average. It was a little above average to me. Everybody has different opinions, but horror fans should have liked this a bit!",Scream 3
406,brandonhelee,Not as bad as the other Scream films.,6,15 September 2015,"I must say I'vie once was a massive Scream fan but as the years went on and my film watching grew I slowly realized that Scream isn't the god send to the horror genre as most people make it out to be and Scream 2 was just a even more stale version of it's predecessor. Now we get to Scream 3 sure pretty bad but certainly the best of the franchise. Scream 2 instead of brining nothing new to table that admitted Scream the original brought something Scream 3 brought something new. The film is about our typical Dewey and Gale relationship that's been getting old but unlike Part 2 it seems a little bit more heart warming to see this relationship grow into it's happier state in the end of the film. Sydney in this film comes off more like a lame Halloween H20's Laurie clone same thing goes for the equally horrendous Rob Zombie's Halloween II. We got a lot of blank almost non existence characters in this film like the security guard & plenty of others. I like the element that they we're playing around with Hollywood and the sleazy underbelly of it. The killer in the film comes off a little too whiny and complainer but I'll take a solo man act over the very much gay relationship between Billy and Stu or the generic almost comical Billy's mother of which was only saved due to her sidekick having a small bit of social commentary but with Roman I like a solo case and the emotion behind it. Scream 3 unlike Halloween H20:20 Years Latter should'vie been the end of the series but we got a worse film eleven years later in Scream 4 of which I consider to be the worst of the whole franchise might review that soon. Scream 3 seemed like a perfect closure to the Sydney,Dewey & Gale storyline instead of a lame bastardization Halloween H20's ending would'vie brought to Michael Myers something non Halloween fans would consider great.",Scream 3
407,phill-9,not bad at all for a 3rd chapter... scary and entertaining,10,5 February 2000,"I have been a fan of the Scream series since the first one came out. I know many of you out there either love it (like me) or u hate it. Scream 3 is bit different from all the other movies in my opinion. At almost every scene there's suspense, instead of just talking and character development. Scream 3 is really scary. Like Scream 2, it starts out a bit stupid, but nearing the climax, it becomes really good and its probably the best climax of all 3. This movie is definitaly a must see for all Scream fans, and a must go for anyone seeking some good laughs (specially from Parker Posey and Jenny McCarthy) and some good suspense. It really was an awesome close for the best slasher flick of the 90's. 5/5",Scream 3
408,phill-9,"three times as funny, scary and entertaining",10,7 February 2000,"Scream 3! The final chapter of the trilogy is finally here. I know reviews have been mixed, with people either detesting it, or loving it. In my opninion, Scream 3 is actually pretty good. The only fault of this movie is that it does has some faults, compared to only a few faults from Scream and Scream 2. Scream 3 is a lot funnier that the 2 previous movies, but it's less scary. We sure could have used a similar car scene (from Scream 2) in the new movie. For sure, the best new character is Jennifer Jolie, played by Parker Posey. She's so damn hilarious. If I was to make a whole new Scream movie, I would choose the beggining of Scream 1, the middle part of Scream 2 and the end of Scream 3. Although the ending and the climax of Scream 3 was the best of all 3 movies, the killer wasn't all that. For this reason, I would pick the killer of Scream 1 to be in this new movie. Overall, Scream 3 does entertain. It does give you jumps and it sure makes you laugh. I strongly advise you to go see it. 5/5",Scream 3
409,blondi99,Might give away some overview ideas of the plot. Just fair warning.,7,2 February 2000,"Scream 3, Stab 3. Murder Hollywood Style. Specifically, Miramax style. Don't get me wrong! It is funny, entertaining, amusing, heartfelt (it has its moments), even bloody, but lacked the suspense of the first two. It was like watching the post-Oscar parties from your bedroom television set. All too aware that these happy, shiny people are glamming it up while you brush your teeth and set your alarm to wake up and trudge back to work the next day. As excited and connected as you want to feel with these party-goers, you just can't quite connect. They all seemed to be having a good time solving the mystery, no longer even glancing at the piles of dead bodies. But then again, if everywhere you go a killer follows, after the first twenty or so murders, I guess your compassion might fly out the window.But to the writers/directors credit, I found myself laughing merrily along with the rest of the audience when time after time, Dewey and the rest of the gang repeat the same mistakes, never quite learning from the first hundred or so murderous attacks. Yet, Sydney, always cool, calm, and collected with the Why me? expression wisely locks herself away, only to discover that barricading her doors provides no more protection than erasing her past. So, as with all trilogies...(even while it pokes fun at them) Scream 3 smoothly takes us back to the beginning and asks the unanswered questions in an attempt to find the ""real"" killer. If this seems jagged it is not your imagination. There are so many ideas, so many stories, so many strong characters that it is hard to not jumble it all up and just give the main idea. All the little ideas, minor characters, cameos (Yay Kevin Smith and Jay Mewes), are what make the film worth paying a ticket for. Maybe don't spend 8 bucks at night, but definitely catch it in theaters some afternoon for half the price. If ya love it, you can see it twice for the price of once. Cant beat that. If ya hate it, well you only blew half the money.",Scream 3
410,monte-13,Disappointing (Spoilers),6,7 February 2000,"As a major fan of this series, I loved Scream and I even really liked Scream 2, but Scream 3 had WAY too many holes to satisfy me as an ending of a trilogy.I would give this movie 6 stars out of 10, and those 6 stars were earned in the first 60% of the movie. The end seemed forced and the movie began to take itself too seriously. Just 2 of the GLARING HOLES in S3 was 1) When Roman shot at Sydney for the 2nd time, HE SHOT HER IN THE FACE, how the hell could he miss from 2 feet away? So that's one Syd should have been dead. And the second hole: In the scene where the house blows up, how did ONE killer shut the power off, open the gas line and Fax 4 pages at the same time? Not to mention that the power was off but the FAX machine was still working!Not that any of the movies endings were ""believable"" but the ending of 3 just didnt seem right, totally reminds me of other movies such as ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"", ""Halloween 6"", ""Psycho IV"", ""Candyman3"" all sequels that try too hard to explain the past. Not to mention the blatent rip-offs of ""House on Haunted Hill"" (secret passages, creepy basement) and the Sixth Sense (Scene with the Syd seeing her mother)...I would slap Wes Craven on the wrist saying ""Bad Wes, Bad Wes!"" He should have dumped all the money in the world to Kevin Williamson to write this last chapter....maybe someday they will do something titled ""Scream: S20"" to finally get the end right as they did with Halloween.....tsk tsk tsk....",Scream 3
411,Dave-627,Very Good for the final film,7,12 February 2000,"Well, I went to Scream 3 to see the finale to one of the greatest slasher series of all time and I wasn't disappointed.  I got just what I wanted. It's all there the killer, the original cast(that have survived the last two films), and a story that will have you pointing your accusing finger at more than one suspect before the film is over.  I found that this one was a bit more comical than the last ones but it still had the audience shrieks of fear throughout the entire film.  Sydney is now an adult.  The killer is also more professional than the others which makes it a little bit more creepy.  I have seen this movie twice now and I liked it even better the second time.  Personally, I am kind of sad to see this rather successful series go, although they really can't do much more with it.  I would give this film 7 out of 10 stars.  It was a worthy finale to a great series.",Scream 3
412,gt3097b-2,"Not the best ending, but at least is an ending...hopefully",6,6 February 2000,"This movie is all that I expected, which isn't much.  It's an ending to the Scream trilogy, assuming Wes Craven, and the cast members have the integrity to stay away from the easy money, and never again return to Woodsboro.
I'm sure everyone hoped for a great surprise when they went to see this, like the firt movie provided, but it's just not here. The only surprise is the actual identity of the killer...as far as the twist ending, it's fairly obvious to anyone about halfway through.  Nothing in the movie made me ""scream"", or anyone else in the sold out theater for that matter.",Scream 3
413,emarone,"It's a sequel, alright.",5,18 February 2000,"Where Scream was clever and Scream 2 was hip, the third installment of the Craven/Williamson too-cool-to-be-cult series was a pretty big dissapointment.  Although they kept me guessing at who the killer was until the end, the suspenseful scenes were predictably scary (a friend and I were timing how long it would take for Ghostface to pop up in the window, etc.) and the blood and gore were rather PG.Despite fine performances throughout, here's hoping Scream doesn't continue to parody slasher flicks and turn into a six or seven-part series.  Let it go out on a marginally good note rather than mock itself into the books a la Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th.",Scream 3
414,tontin,Intense,8,6 February 2000,"After viewing ""Scream 3"", this is what was the general opinion of the audience that were in attendence of the showing that I was at. Many thought it was the best of the series. Others thought it was as good as the first, and almost everyone agreed that it was the scariest of the three.This movie is VERY INTENSE. From the opening scene on it never lets up. It doesn't have the humor of the first two, but it makes up for it with scares - and there are plenty.This is by far the most violent of the three ""Screams"". In fact, not since ""Saving Private Ryan"" have I seen a movie in which almost the entire cast dies.The script and Wes Craven's direction are once again top notch, but like ""Scream 2"" the characters aren't as developed or likeable as the first ""Scream"".The only frustrating thing about ""Scream 3"" is that there are several opportunities to bring back Billy and Stu through flashbacks or through new information that is given to the audience. Unfortunately, we are just left with audio clips of the two and long narrations about them.I wish that Wes Craven would have realized that the audience was really wanting to see Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard one last time. ""Scream 3"" gives them the opportunity to return, but Craven never takes advantage of it.All in all, though, ""Scream 3"" is a very good and scary movie.",Scream 3
415,queen_medea,"Not bad, but not great",6,4 February 2000,"The last installment of the Scream series is, in a word, okay.  For some odd reason it's filled with B-list movie stars (Jenny McCarthy, Matt Keeslar, Parker Posey) who give adequate, but predictable performances--basically just acting scared and in danger.  The writing isn't great, and although it did make me jump a few times, it falls into some of the horror movie cliches the series used to make fun of.  The body count is higher, and the ending is very far-fetched.  Overall, once again, it's not bad, but not great.",Scream 3

I mean c'mon a voice changer! A VOICE CHANGER! It couldn't be more stupidThe only way Im rating this a 2 is because of Neve Campbell (Sydney Prescott) acting, the ""attempt"" in the movie to try to be ""different"" which of course didn't turn out well, and little of the end.",Scream 3

Sidney isn't in it as much but I think it's good for this movie because instead you get to see what happened with Gale and Dewey.The only bad thing about this movie is I didn't want Jennifer Jolie(Parker Posey) to die. She was the best new Character TheScream Trilogy could give!I hope they come out with a 4th movie (which is in talks right now). Overall this is a very good movie !! I like it because you get to see all 5 characters that were mentioned in 3 movies, in this movie.

418,georgekoul,"The weakest of the franchise, still a great one",9,31 October 2021,"The third installment in the franchise has multiple mistakes, forgettable characters and choices that the fans didn't enjoy. Nonetheless, it's a fun, goofy slasher movie set in Hollywood (pretty meta indeed) with very little suspense and dull kills, yet it's very entertaining.People consider this movie to be a bad movie, and I disagree. It's a decent slasher movie, but not a good movie that belongs to the scream franchise. There's too much comedy, but there are still some badass scenes here and there, especially with Sidney in the third act. I think that she's never been so badass and epic in a movie before without taking away from the killer's threat - they fight like two beasts, literally. Some of the characters are a bit forgetful, but I still like them.The killer reveal is lame and his character isn't the best (I won't spoil anything for ya), but I like when they revealed he is also responsible for the events of the first movie. It could take away from Billy's and Stu's legacy, but I don't mind. I don't know if the ""magical"" voice changer is an issue. It's quite unrealistic, yet it's a cool addition and gives the killer a new ability, making him more fearful in some ways.Overall, the movie definitely has some issues, but it's a pretty fun watch if you want to see it yourself or with your friends and family and crack some laughs. It's bad for a scream movie, yet I'd recommend it.9/10.",Scream 3

One thing that made me mad about this entry, considering it was supposedly the finale, is that Neve Campbell couldn't be on set very long due to scheduling conflicts, therefore isn't in the film very long. They should've just waited a year or something to make a more Sidney-Involved entry.This film, although flawed, was very good, and had very good dialogue....especially Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey)...she had the best lines of the series in my opinion. It was a very inadequate film compared to the other two, but was still a very very good movie, and has been in my top 5 movies list of all time since I saw it. And i have watched it probably once every 2 months for the last 10 years....but I swear have a life....hahahaha.This movie might not be the best finale but it's a damn good movie, and I recommend it to everyone who visits this page...and if you are disappointed, don't be, because the 4th film will be out April 15th, 2011.",Scream 3

Movie Trivia: Wes had a cameo in the first film as a janitor and the Clerks VHS box was sitting on top of the VCR when they did a close up of the hidden cam in the first movie.The first one is still the best, but this one is definitely a great ending to the series.",Scream 3
422,chancedelhomme,I'm In The Minority....,9,2 July 2019,"But this is my favorite SCREAM movie, and Roman is by far the best villain in the quadrilogy! My only question is: since in Scream 2, Mrs. Loomis & Mickey were the killers and Roman never mentioned them in his killer reveal monologue like he did Billy & Stu from the original SCREAM...did he just sit back while Sidney was stalked at Windsor College (the action in Part 2 probably playing out during one long weekend, thus Roman might not have had the chance to know about the goings-on at that locale/time until Gale & Cotton's news stories hit the airwaves! I just find it ironic how he pretty much relishes in being culpable for the multiple terrorizations of Sidney but the events in Part 2 aren't even mentioned, as though it never happened (kind of reminds me of the new Halloween!).",Scream 3

OK, I know that perhaps many people won't agree but here is my opinion. For me those movies are even not scary, it's just a bunch of teenagers playing to kill each other, what's the point of this ? The third one achieves to be one of the worst movies of all times, and I can easily understand why not even one of the trilogy appears in the top 250.",Scream 3

Also the killer just doesn't hold up to the last two Screams. He's just not as intimidating or psycho. Good backstory and cool moments though. Parker Posey can do no wrong either lol.",Scream 3

They threw in all these people only to have them be killed off 10 minutes into the film.IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM, THERE ARE SPOILERS BELOW.  I guess one reason that I didn't like the movie was who the killer was. It was kind of obvious that she would have a half brother since her mom slept around with people. I didn't guess which one...but I didn't like who was the killer. I love him for his other roles that he plays and don't think he pulled off the killer role very well. But one thing I will say. Is that I liked it how Sid took his hand as he was dying....H20 tried that but they didn't pull it off that well. Scream 3 did a good job of that. I also thought that this was more funny then scary.

426,dan-303,A success...In the spirit of the first two,10,11 July 2000,"I have to say that this was a rather satisfying conclusion to one of my favorite films. Scream 3 strengthened the relationships between its three original stars, squeezed in some catchy one-liners and kept me on the edge of my seat. While I can't exactly say it matched the quality of the first Scream, it's easy to forget how fresh the original must have seemed at the time. In that sense, comparisons made between Scream 3 and its predecessors are not fair. While the horror genre is more stale than it was in 1996, Scream 3 works with the material leftover from the first two films and comes out a winner.",Scream 3

Don't look for character development in 'Dumb & Dumber', for example. Now, with that, I give you my review of 'Scream 3'.  I read that this movie was slapped together.  Now I'm sure of it.  This movie was so corny, so repetitive, so predictable.  And I liked Scream 1 and 2, so I'm not biased. The ending leaves nothing to the imagination and actually ends up ruining the first movie. This theater was packed to the brim, and nobody was satisfied.",Scream 3
428,Midnightcat,Excitement takes a vacation in this non-thriller.,4,5 February 2000,"I was so disappointed in this movie.  Scream was hilarious, Scream 2 was pretty good, but Scream 3 just didn't measure up.  The regulars were fantastic - David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Neve Campbell, and a special video appearance by Jamie Kennedy were all great.  But the rest of the movie just couldn't support them.  The writing seemed weak and contrived, and the movie seemed more like a vehicle for cramming in famous people who wanted a cameo than the funny/scary as hell franchise we're all used to.  There were few screams, fewer laughs, and I went away wanting a better ending.",Scream 3
429,Hypnotic31,"Definitely has its weak points, but overall a pretty good time!",8,4 February 2000,"I'll admit, I had low expectations coming into this movie. The whole teen-slasher movie formula is pretty tired by now, and I wasn't sure if even the Scream franchise's self-mocking humor could redeem it. Yet, on the whole, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the movie lacked solidity on the plot; yes, it was sometimes a little predictable. But this predictability didn't diminish the fright factor one bit. You hear the scary music, and you *know* someone is going to jump up at the window, but you still gasp and grab the person sitting next to you. It's involuntary, and that's what makes the movie entertaining. Fear is one of the most basic human emotions, and no matter how much we're expecting the scary killer, you're still shocked when you really do see him.The plot, I do have to note, was a bit thin at times. It seemed at times to be struggling to connect with itself, especially when discussing events that took place in the earlier movies. It was in places such as these where Kevin Williamson's absence was truly felt. Williamson was the one who gave life to the characters; he supposedly had begun the series planning a trilogy, and it would have only been proper for him to stick it out until the end. Unfortunately, however, producer Wes Craven apparently felt differently, and the decision to substitute virtual unknown Ehren Kruger was a detriment to the plausibility. Now, don't get me wrong here, I did indeed enjoy the way Ehren Kruger writes; `Arlington Road' was enjoyable, and the writing in the `Scream 3' was certainly of high quality. It just wasn't *right*. First of all, Kruger has no experience with the genre, and more importantly, he has no experience with the `Scream' franchise. Joining as a writer in the middle of a series is always a difficult transition, and you could see a general stylistic difference between Williamson's and Kruger's screenplays. Kruger has a great deal of potential, but it must be refined first; the finale to as successful a series as the `Scream' movies is simply not the time to be testing untried talent.The characters also seemed more artificial this time around than they had been in previous installments. After the last 2 movies, the only original characters remaining were Sidney (Neve Campbell), Dewey (David Arquette), and Gale (Courtney Cox Arquette). One would think that, after all this time, their personalities would truly shine, yet they come across as thinly as the new additions to the cast. While I mostly fault the writing, problems with the acting certainly existed; it seemed at times as if the actors were simply trying to get through the scene so they could go home. In fact, this `are we done yet' attitude was persistent throughout much of the movie, almost as if the cast realized that the slasher-movie boom was dried up, and they just needed to get through this final performance before putting the genre back to sleep.I'm being a bit critical here, probably because the negative aspects are easier to put into words. What I do have to say, above all, is that I *liked* the movie, quite a lot. Looking at it as a reviewer, there were plot holes, and weak acting, and a fuzzy script written by an unknown; but looking at it as a teenager, I have to say that it was a fun movie. Although it lacked certain elements, it did manage to keep the most important: it was entertaining and enjoyable to watch. Just don't try to look too deeply, because you'll find that not much is there beyond the surface.",Scream 3
430,NICK C,Better than the second,9,6 February 2000,"Scream 3 definitely gets a ""thumbs up"" for me.  The second film in the series was kind of disappointing, so I walked into the theater with low expectations.  However, I did thoroughly enjoy the film and didn't see the ending coming at all.

It did have a few flaws like useless characters(e.g. Randy's Sister) and the begining of the movie was obvious, but beside those It was really done nicely. Yesterday I heard that They might make another Scream. Only if Scream 3 makes over 00 mil in the box offices. In the first 10 days it made over 0 mil, so everyone...SEE SCREAM 3!

Then the killer moves on to the set of Stab 3, the final film about the killings back in Sid's hometown. Someone from Sid's past is back and furious. Someone dressed up in a familiar halloween ghost-costume, with a very sharp knife at hand. To find out who it is she must go way back in a past she'd rather not to... This part is much better than the disappointing Scream 2. It's a worthy finish, and you really don't have a clue who's going to live or who's going to die. Not even Sid is safe, because as the police on the case (Patrick Dempesey) puts it: ""... In the third installment of trilogy, all bets are off."" The film has got humour, thrills and a clever plot (as in the first one) and it was surprisingly good. A pity Kevin Williamson abandoned the project, and gave it to Ehren Krueger. I imagine Williamson would've done it better. But as said before in the one line summary: It's ""a worthy finish to a brilliant trilogy...""

I thought that was the fantastic part, where it's Hollywood, anything can happen! And in the end, the killer is a little too fantastic when you find out who it actually is. The killer is so unoriginal. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, so if you have seen it and wonder why I think it's unoriginal, email me. The whole movie idea is very original though. I liked Scream 3 though. I am now a fan of the Scream trilogy, thanks to this movie. I thought it was really nice, but it was a bit lame in a few parts.One thing that I did not like about the production of this movie was Ehren Kruger. I know that Kevin Williamson was not going to write the script for this movie for two reasons, (and its a shame, because it would have been even better!) 1)He couldn't finish it in time, with Teaching Mrs. Tingle and all the other stuff going on, and 2)because he wanted to take the story to Woodsboro again. And, you may have noticed, what I don't like about Kruger is that he made fun of Kevin Williamson's idea. Stab 3 is about the ""Return to Woodsboro"" and notice how cheesy and phony the characters are. Truthfully, Ehren Kruger did it for the money. He didn't care. Dimension was desperate, so they got someone who wasn't busy and who doesn't know crap about the Scream films. Oh well!",Scream 3

I watched it twice so far, but I will see it again. In Germany it is already more successful than the previous two, after two weeks!!!The end is also better as Scream 2! Parker Posey and Matt Keeslar have done a very good job! And Neve Campbell, well, you know how perfect she is!

439,fpf,The best Scream!,10,18 August 2000,"Since I am a Scream fan, i no doubt, loved this movie. I thought the first Scream was funny, original, scary, and witty. after seeing the first one several times, I was so excited to see the second. But, i came out a little disappointed. There was no way, you could've guessed one of the killers. I found that the killers were minor characters, as in Scream1 they were not main, but have good screen time, and was not that scary. But, the more i watched the movie, the more i liked it. So, by the time i heard about the third in the Scream series, I was counting down the days till it came out. I ended up seeing it the day after it came out with my best friend. I found that it was scary, original, and had some really good fight scenes and unforgettable characters (PARKER POSEY'S ""JENNIFER JOLIE""). The voice changer this time was really unique and very clever. I also thought the buddy/hatred-ness  between Courteney Cox and Parker Posey was hysterical. Mainly i thought Parker fueled most of the movie with her comedic preformances. I thought the ending at Roman's birthday was truly the best. And i was also surprised to see Jenny McCarthy give such a good performance for just the short time she was in it. David Arquette also gave a good performance, along with the rest of the cast.  Neve Campbell was great with her lines like ""It's your turn to scream, ***hole!"" and ""You want me, mother******, come and get me!"" I found those to be effective if not cliched. So, if you are a fan  (or not) of the Scream series, you MUST, i repeat, MUST see this movie. I will guarantee you will have a good time watching it, as i did. 10/10",Scream 3

Only in a Hollywood movie would this ever be remotely plausible. Once again, the audience is subjected to another guessing game as to who is under that costume. I guess in the reality of this film, being targeted by a serial killer every couple of years is normal. The FBI believes there are at least 20 and as much as 50 active serial killers in the country today. How unfortunate for Ms. Prescott that she would defy the odds to be the focus of them three times.

For this film, I gave it around 50 shots, alright? I love Neve Campbell, she's cute, she's adorable. But, her features are exactly as attractive in the 2nd. When I first saw her hair I thought maybe she would grow it out. Short hair is not pretty on her. The cast, the originals are skating past like they are doing a home movie. While the rest are just fabulously (sarcastic) gingerly reading their lines with retardation.The killer, Roman, has a good reason to hate Sidney. However, his sore acting skills don't help. I mean, the voice box, it may seem ""good"" in the script, but however will not work while filming. It just brings ""the killer is trying to hard, and the actor is, as well"" to a new level.

The fact that the movie is based on making a movie of the first scream movie already spells it out that it will be a horrible movie, i mean the first one was horrible... anyway the killer being the long lost son who is actually a successful Hollywood directer is lame just lame. This movie was like a high budget C rater. I think that after scream one the director should have been executed or at least banned from ever making a movie again. Worst part of the movie is when the 'bad guy' gets shot. and they think its over only to discover *SUPRISE* he isn't dead?!?! my god nice twist I'm amazed.... no.

Scream 3 as a Scream movie was horrid!The opening sequence had nothing on the original, it was kinda better than Scream 2's opening scene, but not that topping that would be hard.Scream 3 just didn't seem like a Scream movie to me. Scream was a no non-sense no supernatural elements horror movie. In Scream 3 when Sidney started seeing her mother from beyond the grave, even if it was all dream sequence it blew it. That was a completely stupid, not scary and therefore not needed. Scream 3 is the worst Scream movie of the trilogy. There were few scary scenes, I jumped maybe once, and I'm the biggest scardie cat out. The phone voice changer that could mimic any voice really sucked. It wasn't menacing at all when you heard a familiar voice - it may be slightly suspensful as we never know who it actually is talking, it could have worked, but it didn't.I was truly disappointed with the final, and God, let it be the final, in the Scream series. I am a HUGE Scream fan and the trilogy overall would rate an 7.5 out of 10(it could have been higher but Scream 3 knocked off maybe a point, it stays a high rank on the strength of the first film).Scream 3 just wasn't scary.

All the Scream movies follow a pattern - one of the criticisms I read of Scream 3 was that it was a Xerox copy of the first two - but all sequels are basically remakes of previous films that preceeded it e.g. the Bond series.  The success of the Scream films is that Craven and Williamson (and now Scream 3 scribe Kreuger) have blended the ingredients differently each time - you'll definitely enjoy the ""Hollywood"" flavour of this one!",Scream 3

Of course, as many of you will know, the insaneness takes place on the set of Stab 3...and one funny thing is how everyone makes fun of the third installment of Stab, and how stupid it is.  Convenient that this all takes place in Scream 3.

Two years later, we get Scream 2...a great sequel to a great original.  Now, we have Scream 3.  Who would have thought?Personally I am a huge fan of the Scream trilogy, and while I am sad to see it end, I am happy at the same time.  Anymore would probably ruin the whole Scream franchise and it better be over at Scream 3.This movie had it all, the laughs, the scares, and the shocks.  It starts off with the famous opening scene death, which was done greatly once again, but nothing can top the Drew Barrymore scene.  Next we're reintroduced to Gail Weathers, who gets the news that another murder has happenend, in connection with the Woodsboro Murders and the Windsor College murders.  We than see Sidney, who now lives in hiding, fearful that somebody will find her and kill her.  She says something along the lines that whoever she gets close to dies...hmm...yeah I think she may be right.I'm not gonna say much more...but we are introduced to a great supporting cast after that...Scott Foley, Jenny McCarthy, Patrick Dempsey, Matthew Kessler and in my opinion, the person who was my favorite character, Parker Posey.  Parker does a fantastic job acting like Gail and in the movie all together.  I'm not gonna ruin the ending, but I wouldn't be lying if I said that it was a little disappointing for me.  I think it could have ended a bit better, but that didn't ruin the movie for me.  Scream can be put to rest and have a place in horror movie history as the best horror trilogy ever made.Thank you Kevin Williamson for creating Scream and Wes Craven for making Kevin's words into a masterpiece of cinema.",Scream 3
452,Reanna,Scream 3 offers less of the same.,6,4 February 2000,"I have to say that I went into the theater with high expectations for this film, partly because I am a big fan of the series.  It was decent enough but not really what I had hoped for.Good movie sequels earn their kudos by offering more of what the fans of the films have come to expect more frights, humor and more of what made the previous two films unique it's self-commentating parody.  But unfortunately ""Scream 3"" offers less of all three elements.Enough familiar aspects remain to entertain the most hardcore ""Scream"" buffs.  But ""Scream 3"" makes the mistake that it's predecessors succesfully side steped-it takes it's self too seriously.As many ""Scream"" fans know the films always open with a pre-credit murder sequence that is often the highlight of the films.  That is certainly the case in this film.  And in this aspect ""Scream 3"" does equal the first two films.  Most of this movies suspense and originality is crammed into the opening 10 minutes of the film.  The scene makes disturbing use of one the vetrans of series, and it is a scene that left me feeling queasy for quite some time.The new killings seemed to be linked to Sidney's long ago murdered mother. The film tries to resolve the various loose ends of the series by going back to the beginning.  As for the rest of the plot details I will leave that for the rest of you ""Scream"" fans to discover.  However, to my disapointment very few of them are at all shocking.Overall I think that ""Scream 3"" puts a period on the trilogy when there should have been an exclamation point.",Scream 3
453,Ash119,Lived Up To My Expectations,10,5 February 2000,"The movie begins with Cotton Weary driving in L.A. while talking on a cellular phone.  And of course someone clicks in and you can only guess who it is-thus begining the traditional Scream opening murder suspense scene. Sidney Prescott has moved down to the Los Angeles area and has basically gone into hiding, working out of her house as a crisis-hotline operator. Gale Weathers is the same as always of course as a bitchy tabloid news anchor.  She has written a new novel though which is what the movie inside Scream 2 (STAB) is based except Stab 2 has already been released and they are in production of Stab 3.  Dewey is also on the scene as a type of helper on the set.  One by one the cast of the film turn up murdered according to script.  The old hollywood mansion as the final scene makes a great setting as the surprise twist-final deaths take place.  Definately a satisfactory ending that kinda wraps it all up, with some great cameo appearances especially with the video of Randy that was a great touch to keep the 'trilogy-movie buff' type of thing in the movie. The movie goes back to its roots and fills in all the little holes of the first one. Of course the movie may have been a little better with Kevin Williamson's touch but overall it was still great.  I went into the movie without having very high expectations at all.  I am a very big fan of the original Scream, yet going into Scream 2 I was expecting it to be very good and I was extremely disappointed with the outcome.  So going into Scream 3 I just didn't set myself up for the disappointment.  But I was very very pleased it was AWESOME Go see this movie if you are a fan of the original.I'd give it a 9.5 out of 10",Scream 3
454,wimbledon,"Disappointing, but still good stuff",7,5 May 2000,"Disappointing finale to the trilogy - I didnt guess the killer, not surprising since, in my opinion, the motive was pretty tenuous, presumably the director thought so too judging from the killer's long description to tell us why!! Nonetheless Scream 3 did keep me on the edge of my seat and there were some nice touches, like when Sydney revisits her old house in Woodsboro on a Hollywood set. Two points to throw in: 1. Why did the killer blow up someone in the house when every other killing in every other film has been a stabbing? 2. Why on earth is (in England at least) Deon Richmond one of five faces on the promo poster (the others being Campbell, Arquette, Cox and Parker Posey) when his part is very small and irrelevant?",Scream 3
455,deermada,SCREAM 3 is only a little better than STAB 3 (Potential spoilers included!),4,4 February 2000,"It's unfortunate, but the more I think about ""Scream 3"", the more I think they messed it all up.  As far as I can tell from everything I've read, the powers that be at Mirimax demanded that the film be set in Hollywood, which was not what Williamson originally intended.  (He planned for it to start in Hollywood and then move back to Woodsboro -- hence ""STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO"".)  That explains why all the pre-release synopses I've read were all wrong.Rumor has it that Williamson bailed out on the film, using the excuse that he was too busy, because he preferred to have nothing to do with the film rather than have his name on a script that he didn't like.  That makes a lot of sense.  With all the connections the film tried to make between ""Stab"" and ""Scream"", why was ""Stab 3"" called ""Return to Woodsboro"" when ""Scream 3"" never actually returned to Woodsboro?  I think it's because they kept some of Williamson's ideas and changed the rest.  As a result it falls flat. One of my major complaints after seeing the film was that all the victims were lame Hollywood types, and not anyone that we really cared about (with the possible exception of Cotton).So I think Wes Craven did his best to keep Ehran Kruger on track with the script -- in fact Kruger makes comments to that effect -- but even Wes himself couldn't save the film from all the lousy cooks that insisted on being in the kitchen.  And that's too bad.I have been hearing for a long time that Neve Campbell was iffy about whether or not she was going to do the movie.  I think she should have said ""This movie sucks.  Get Tori Spelling to play 'Sidney'.""If you liked this film, please don't feel like I'm dumping on you.  I actually enjoyed sitting through it.  (The opening sequence with Cotton and his girlfriend was just great!)  What really bothered me was what I DIDN'T feel after I left the theater.  In the first two films, I was moved by the lives that were lost, and by the grief of the people who would miss them. After seeing #3, I felt nothing, because there was no real loss to feel.So all I can do is hope that Williamson will one day be able to make his own final chapter, and pretend that ""Scream 3"" never happened, like William Peter Blatty did with ""The Exorcist"".",Scream 3

That will definitely put it within the top 10-15 highest grossing films this year. Very exciting! How many third part installments in a horror genre are this successful?!?!However, you have the usual number of skeptics who are afraid to say they enjoy such a film. Thats really too bad. They might be more comfortable renting ""Shakespeare in Love"" and laughing at just the right parts so all their friends can see how clever they are. If thats why you see a movie, well more power to you.Scream 3 transcends all genres. It does exactly what it wants, and does it well. It has thrills, definitely laughs, and a cast who looks like they are having a lot of fun. Parker Posey is hilarious!!! On opening night, everyone in the packed theatre was having a great time. Isn't that why we go to the movies? No, my life wasn't changed by this film, but did you expect this to be a life altering film? Heck, I enjoyed ""American Pie"" for what it was, but it didn't change my life, or the way I look at film.I think people expect too much from a movie these days. I want to help people to understand Scream 3. Some people think, ""well, I laughed a lot and I wasn't really scared, so it must have been a bad movie."" This is an inaccurate assessment. The movie definitely has more laughs than scares, Parker Posey is in the film for crying out loud!!! It laughs at itself!! Its like a Scooby Doo mystery. It also has a few parts that make you jump. Thats the beauty of it, this film doesn't fit snugly into a perfect little category. I mean, is Forrest Gump a comedy or a drama? Well, it certainly has both elements. One really must free their mind and accept that this film is not just a scary movie. Its a FUN movie!!I would also like to mention that a lot of people seem to think the film should have been different. For instance, I hear a lot of ""The movie should have had this happen"" or It would have been a lot scarier if this took place"". Well, it didn't. The movie did its own thing, and its still making millions. You can find these same type of people quite often commenting on ""The Phantom Menace""... ""Lucas should have done this."" Well guess what? He doesn't care because its his movie. Remember? You just paid a few bucks to sit on your butt and watch it!!! Nothing can satisfy these people.In closing, Scream 3 will be enjoyable to anyone who's looking to have a good time! Everyone else, lighten up! Never be afraid to have fun!!!!",Scream 3

Critics who bash this movie as just another sequel obviously have been subjected to too many movie series not intended as trilogies (Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc.).  Like Jamie Kennedy's character says from beyond the grave, trilogies are completely different from plain old sequels.I went into the theater with a vague idea of who the killer might be, but nothing definite - the way it should be.  Right away, one of my guesses was shot down (or ""cut"" down).  The rest of the film left me guessing - eventually, I picked up on the even more vague clues and figured out the motive and the killer's connection to Sidney, but the identity of the killer was a complete mystery to me until the mask came off.  A satisfying end to the whole ordeal - the whole thing makes sense now.Maybe it was just me, but I found the overall tone and mood of this one to be much darker and somber than the first two.  A friend of mine who went to see it with me said that it was more of Hannibel Lechter kind of horror flick than a teen scream queen flick.Overall, I thought that this movie was every bit as edge-of-your-seat-ish as the first and as humor/satirical as the second.  It's not just another sequel - it's a very well put together trilogy.",Scream 3

459,rkarlberg,"Not scary, not funny, not entertaining.",3,24 July 2000,"I enjoyed the first Scream, but this one was a major disappointment.  The first time we saw the killer's costume, it was actually scary.  There is just something about that mask that really gets to you.  But by now, we have seen it so many times, that it just isn't scary anymore.These characters are so one dimensional, we simply don't care what happens to them.  The movie is supposed to be self aware, one of the things that made the first one great, but this one is just a generic slasher film. There is only one brief scene where the horror movie trilogy is discussed, and that's about it.  The characters do the usual stupid things otherwise.There are also many ludicrous coincidences.  Time after time, the victim runs around and hides somewhere, and the killer just happens to be right there.  How did he manage to set up things so perfectly?  And the voice device he uses?  Things like that made me begin to hate this movie.The last straw was the ending.  The killer could have been anyone, even a random person off the street.  The motivation we are given is a joke.  It's painfully obvious that this movie was made just to cash in on the Scream franchise.",Scream 3
460,Bloody Realms,What ever happened to horror?,1,5 February 2000,"Let me sum up my thought of scream 3 very briefly: Just like the first 2, it sucked horribly. Not as bad as the second one, but worse than the first one.As I left the theater, I was in much discontent. I kept wondering what happened to the great horror movie? I went to the last showing, it ended at 1:00am. (A great time of night to be scared.) My girlfriend and I were up till 4am discussing the demise of the true scary movie.The original Scream movie knew the facts: That horror movies had become nothing more than hack'em slash'em gore fests. Designed and written to make the audience jump in it's seats more times than the last movie did. The original Scream set out to mock this, and create a new type of horror flick. But it quickly turned into the same type. As did the sequel, and now, the third (god i hope) final 'chapter'.Does anyone remember what makes a horror movie scary? Maybe it's just me, but jumping in my seat (which by the way never happens in Scream 3, it's too predictable) doesn't mean a movie is scary.  Some of the scariest movies I've ever seen never claimed to be scary at all. Such as Aliens. Aliens was a sci-fi/action movie, with a few scary elements. But James Cameron managed to weave a story that haunted me for weeks, i didn't want to sleep the first night that i had seen it.My girlfriend had nightmares from Independence Day. By no means a horror movie. But it managed to make an impression on her as a very scary movie.The greats of horror, Mary Shelley and Alfred Hitchcock for example, knew how to scare people. And they did it very well. Horror doesn't mean jumping in your seat a few times, then going home remembering that it's just a silly movie. Horror is when you go home from the movie, or close the book, and you don't want to lay down and close your eyes. You just can't shake the thoughts, you know it's not real, but something just lingers in the back of your mind, not letting you rest.I find it a grave injustice that movies like Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, Halloween, Friday 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc. get called horror movies. When in fact, they are nothing more than a cheap slasher, shocker, or gore flick.Scream 3 is probably the finest insult to date, to the horror movie category (even worse than the final Critters movies).",Scream 3
461,dragon1734,Did you expect this to be that good?,7,5 February 2000,"Ok, first rule... this is the third part of a trilogy.  Therefore, I think it's unreasonable to place such high expectations on Scream 3 to deliver big.  It delivers, but not even close to the way that the first two did. The plotline was fairly typical of trilogies (probably intended from the start), there were many loopholes in the story (like Randy's unmentioned sister appearing out of nowhere to deliver his 'eulogy'... a bit of a stretch there), and Neve's performance was even worse than the original. However, there are moments in the film that make it all worth seeing.  For star wars fans (no spoilers here), there is about 30 seconds of film in this movie that are worth paying full price to see it twice.  I was so happy that my favorite character (Randy of course), got his spot in the film, and explained things so well for himself.  Finally,  we see technology runamuk again in this film with the clever new devices used by the killer.  Those three points alone give my recommendation full force.

I know that a lot of people didn't enjoy Scream 2, but I found it very scary, despite a lack of jokes and a end a little inappropriate and impossible. But still, it was good. Scream 3 was the movie I expected the most, and I was a bit disappointed. Of course, the acting was good, there was the returning actors Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox Arquette, who are like always the bests. Neve has done such an incredible work on the scream trilogy, she is one of the best actresses of her generation, and I am so sad ""Party of five"" is about to end. I learned also that ""Friends""' 6th season was the last and I am so sad about it because I am a big fan, who taped all the episodes ! Anyway, my subject is Scream 3. The new cast, except Jenny McCarthy, Kelly Rutherford, Scott Foley and Lance Henriksen, was unknown (for us in France). I haven't seen Parker Posey, Deon Richmond (whose part is useless in this movie), Emily Mortimer or Matt Keeslar in other movies or TV shows. In the first Screams, there was Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart, Jada Pinkett, Jerry O'Connell... who were famous because of their shows or some of their movies. But here, new coming actors are very good and funny, particularly Parker Posey who did a great job. The acting was good, so were the jokes. It was the funnier Scream movie. All the cameos, like Carrie Fisher or Roger Corman , were funny, the characters of Jennifer Jolie and Gale Weathers were great too and Randy's videotape was excellent. I laughed a lot, but wasn't scared enough. And that's my point. Was it scary ? Not enough. The first scene, who's the best generally (even if you didn't like Scream 2, you had to admit that the first scene was a good idea and was scary !), is here not scary at all. Kelly Rutherford is a pretty, good actress and she knows how to shout but her part was thin. And who cares if she dies ? I was disappointed by this scene, even if I jumped of my sit a little. Then were the murders not hard, not bloody enough. The killers just catch the characters and stab them, without any pursuit. Remember the scene with the murder of Tatum in the first one, or the murder of Gail's camera guy, or in Scream 2 the murder of Maureen Evans (Jada Pinkett), Cici Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar) or Randy Meeks ! But still, this is a Scream and Ehren Kruger did a great job. That was hard to make a screenplay in a couple of weeks ! The ending is a great end for the movie, and for the trilogy, but it is like Scream 2 and the murders in the second movie never existed ! Sidney seems not to remember those atrocities. Well, it is funny, a bit scary, well acted but not as good as the first Scream.I gave ***1/2 /5",Scream 3
465,withnail82,Scream Wee,2,27 September 2000,"Now as a film student I try very hard not to hate every film Hollywood produces, and my god I try really hard but when such excrement such as scream 3 is smeared over the big screen it makes life very hard for me. Now don't get me wrong Hollywood can produce some great films (The Matrix, Batman, American Beauty) and I loved both Scream and Scream 2 because they knew not to take themselves too seriously.  Scream was a great Horror satire witty and sharp to the end, Scream 2 sent up the ever so crass sequel, but what is with scream 3 and it's straight to video plot scraped together most probably by the Tea boy in his lunch hour. Scream 3 is over long with new characters that I just don't give a toss about. By the time you find out how the Killer is you miss the obviousness of it because you just don't care. And don't even get me started on the fact that the best character was killed off in scream 2.Oh dear Holly wood will you ever learn.

467,Rincewind82,The final part of the most famous horror movies of the late 90's,4,28 February 2001,"No matter how much I try to be objective about the whole Scream ""saga"" I can't achieve it so I will be as subjective as I can be. I was never a big fun of scary movies, but I liked watching the good ones. When I heard about Scream, I thought that the mix of horror and humour would be something interesting. Then I got Scream 1 to see. The only scene I found interesting in that movie was the one with the car keys towards the end of the film. The rest of the film was just a bit above average. The case with Scream 2 was even worst. The whole story with the psycho mother was a bit far stretched and the film was just a repetition of the first one in my opinion. And then Scream 3 came into life. I found the fact that the movie was going to give us additional story secrets quite fascinating. I love trilogies, so I thought maybe we're in for a great surprise with this movie. The movie started quite well but it didn't turn out to be something unique. In the beginning all kinds of secrets seemed to exist about Sid's late mother but the end disappointed me very much. I won't reveal anything about it because I don't want to totally ruin the movie, but I believe the writers could have been more creative. Furthermore, there isn't a scary scene in a movie which is supposed to be a horror movie. All the murders are shown as they would be shown in an adventure or gangster movie. There is no gore at all. And that is a disadvantage for a horror movie. I found the scene with Jay and Silent Bob quite interesting (Dogma and Clerks forever :)). The rest of the movie wasn't something exceptional. Even Gayle wasn't the ""bitch"" she was in the other two movies. As a closing to this review I would like to say that the scream trilogy is nothing exceptional in my opinion. It cause a reappearance of all these horror movies which take place in little american towns and the victims are mostly teenagers. I don't know if this is good or not but if I want to see a scary movie I would prefer to see something more original.",Scream 3

But they can't help sneaking him in anyway, on a prerecorded tape to explain ""the rules"".*While these rules are clearly spelled out- its the last movie,so anything can happen, and anyone can die, the movie proceeds to ignore them completely. I was waiting to see which of the main characters would die. But none of them did. Also, the killer is supposed to be almost superhuman because its the last film. But I seem to remember it being harder to kill the guys in Scream 1 than this guy.*The killer himself, is a minor character until the end, when he is revealed. You shouldn't have to think twice, and say ""Who?"" when the killer is revealed. (I thought they would have learned their lesson from Scream 2 about this one.)

Like I'm ever going to win an award playing YOU!-Parker Posey in Scream 3,10,28 December 2003,"Welcome back Neve, David and my personal favorite, Courteney, to one of the best horror series ever to hit the big screen.  All three are back and are in top form.  As a huge FRIENDS fan, it's always fun to see the non-Monica, Gale Weathers, and to see another side of Cox-Arquette's talent.
The finale in the Scream trilogy, and while perhaps not the scariest of the three, it is certainly the most funny.  That is thanks largely to the brilliant casting of the satiric roles belonging to Parker Posey and Jenny McCarthy.Parker Posey playing Courteney Cox Arquette's ""Gale"" in the movie Stab 3 within this movie, Scream 3, was a stroke of genius.  For those not familiar with Posey's work I strongly recommend checking out ""The House Of Yes.""Another welcome attribute to this third and final (?) chapter in the series is the way in which they tie up the loose ends and allow certain characters a sense of closure.You definitely need to view these 3 in order, but it's all scary fun!",Scream 3

Some of you (including the characters in the movie) suspect that the killer found it by using Dewey's cell phone. Well they're right and wrong at the same time. Yes the killer was using a cell phone but, no it wasn't Dewey's. If you paid attention to the beginning of the movie, you'd know a guy named Cotton Wearey. He was not only the first person the killer stabbed, but the first person the killer called for information on the whereabouts of Sidney. After Cotton was killed, the killer must've taken his cell phone and copied the number off of it. Speaking of Dewey, if you really paid attention to the movie, you'll know that conversation Dewey and Gale had about how he removed Sidney's case file from police archives. That's the reason why the killer called Cotton. I don't blame the killer, if Sid's mom hadn't slammed the door in his face, he wouldn't have Billy try to kill her in the first movie.",Scream 3
475,battleroyales,In defense of Scream 3,9,18 June 2018,"I actually didn't hate Scream 3, which appears to be a controversial opinion among fans of the franchise. Hey, I'd even go as far as saying it's GOOD. As a big fan of Neve Campbell, I do absolutely adore Sidney, but it was refreshing having the movie with a split focus, seeing in more detail the adventures of Dewey and Gale. I also loved to hate the new characters - Parker Posey as Jennifer was absolutely hilarious and I thought the inclusion of the Stab 3 cast was a genius move. Even the ending wasn't that bad, and while the reveal of the killer felt a bit weak due to his Roman's irelevance as a character, if you will yourself to believe it, plotholes in the first movie can be explained away by this big reveal. Personally, I'm not sure how you could dislike this movie. It's still funny, despite Williamson's lack of input on the screenplay, and it's different - something the franchise is known for that I think it delivered on again. If it was the same as the first two it'd have little impact, and this shake-up of the formula was well done. While maybe it's not as solid a film as the two before it (the deaths certainly aren't as memorable), as a Scream nerd it was still totally enjoyable, and provided a good end to the 'trilogy'.",Scream 3
476,Jules-37,~SPOILERS~ Garbage,3,4 February 2000,"To tell you the truth I liked Scream 1 and Im ashamed of it but it was funny so I liked that.  Scream 2 just plane sucked and now they made the trilogy horrible by topping it off with Scream 3.  This movie wasnt to bad, mediocere makeup effects.  The scene where Sidney dead mother is in the window could of been terrifying but it wasnt.  The death scenes werent origional just your basic stabing and stuff.  I kinda liked it until I figured out the killer.  (HERE COMES THE SPOILER)  In the scene were Sidney is talking to the cop in his office I noticed that Sidney had on the necklass Jerry O'Connell who played her boyfriend gave her in Scream 2.  I figured ""this is weird"" then I remembere what the necklace had on it ROMAN letters that's right ROMAN letters.  And what was the name of the director of Stab 3 ROMAN.  Right there I knew who the killer was but I didnt know his motive.  I figured O.K. maybe something really cool happens at the end. Then the climax hits,  Roman reveils himself and I was right (and I made my friend pay up because I made a bet with him in the middle of the movie) Then when I found out that Roman is Sidneys ""long lost brother"" I fliped out,  that is such a let down to a suposide UNBELIEVABLE trilogy, which is the words my friend Colin used after he saw it the first time.  The only thing that was Unbelievable is that Wes Craven could allow something that crappy in his planned Trilogy.  The movie wasnt all bad,  some parts were funny and my favourite charactor Randy had a cameo but because of the ending I gave this movie * out of **** Dont waste your time or money See the first one because its atleast decent~Jesse~",Scream 3
477,hellboy,A mostly satisfying conclusion to a memorable horror trilogy,3,5 February 2000,"As a film on its own, Scream 3 fails miserably. But as the concluding chapter to the plot threads raised mostly by the first Scream, Scream 3 gives us proper closure with the characters we've come to know and root for, and gives us a clear and underlying theme of vengeance that will color the entire trilogy on future viewings. Is this good or bad? It depends on you, though the final revelations do diminish the power and intensity of the killers we met in the first two movies, now that there is really a clear culprit to blame rather than society, psychology, etc. Still, Scream 3 fulfils its duty by ending the trilogy and keeping us entertained for another 2 hours of bloodshed and mayhem. Who knows, we may see another sequel down the line, but assuming we don't 3 brings things very happily to a satisfying close.",Scream 3
478,BigSexxE,Scream WEEEEE!!!!!!!!,10,4 February 2000,"Finally, a movie series that ends on as much a high note as is made possible.  Scream 3 is a funny, intense, and actualy has a heart warming ending.  No, you did not misunderstand what I said, the VERY end of the movie (after the killer is revealed to be......Sorry can't spoil it!) is a magnificant wrap up. The movie opens with the death of Cotton Weary and his girlfriend Christina (Kelly Rujtherford).  We are then transported to the foothills of California where Sidney has taken up a career as a abuse hotline operator. She soon learns of Cotton's death and fears the worst.  The police are down playing the murder as a copycat, because Cotton is now a very successful talk show host, and one of the  most hated. Soon, one by one, the cast and people related to the movie are being killed off in the order they are murdered in the script.  But, the killer is a true believer ibn Auteur theory of film and tends to make last second rewrites. The death scenes in this movie take a back seat to what the film is realy about.  The wrapping up of the entire franchise.  There is only onbe killer this time around, and everything from why Billy and Stu were attempting to kill Sidney to who really killed her mom is reveled.  The climatic end takes us to John Milton's mansion which is kind of a West Coast ""Studio 54"".  The mazes and intensity in the climatic 40 minutes is truely wonderful.  The very end of the film is heart warming and should bring a load of applause from the theater you see it in. So this is the end to the series that made us laugh, cringe, and gasp in terror.  I for one am glad I was able to witness all three in the theater, and take my hat off to everyone involved in making these wonderful films.Grade: A+",Scream 3
479,Drac-7,Scream 3: Suck-o-rama!,3,7 February 2000,"Scream 3. Like a lot of sequels, they tend to get worse as they progress in numbers, and the Scream trilogy is no exception! This movie was SO bad, I smacked myself across the face for thinking this one could actually try to pick up and try to redeem where the other horrible installment left off!! The words that come to mind...let's see...boring, rehashed, terrible script, predictable, annoying, and lastly UNSCARY. Hell, even my wife who jumps at the smallest little cheap scare in any movie, didn't even budge a muscle! The movie was a long, drawn-out convoluted mess, from start to finish. They totally abandoned the feel of the first movie, which made the first so good. The first one drew on the satire of horror movies, mocking them, and putting them into a real life perspective. That was the formula that worked, and why they didn't choose to extend that, is beyond me. When they tried, it just turned into rehashed sam-ol same-ol. The plot had so much going on, that they wanted you to think that it was some sort of Agatha Christy mystery-theater novel. Who cares? I don't, and certainly not the teeny boppers this movie was slated for. Drac's Decision: F",Scream 3

It seems at this point in the series, the actors and the script itself are just going through the motions. I am glad however that they are ending the series now leaving it with a little credibility. After about 4 installments of a horror franchise, it becomes old and boring. Scream 3 doesn't break any new ground, and you can almost predict things before they happen. Believe it or not, but the scream franchise is starting to show its age, thanks in part to the third installment. For the scream fan such as myself, it's enough to get you through the night.

One of the best moments of this film comes in the form of Gale...wait, Jennifer...wait, well...the Gale Weathers' in this film.  Parker Posy's impersonation leads to much of the film's comedic appeal.  High action and true suspense make up for the lack of originality plot wise.  Scream's 1 and 2 were genius, Scream 3 is formulaic, but only in the sense that we may have seen this before.  And that is the point...WE HAVE!  Originality in the horror genre is as dead as, well...Drew, Jada, ""Buffy"", and Randy.

484,chaze_r,A great finisher with a bad finish.,9,4 February 2000,"Scream 3 is here.  Was it worth it?  Oh yes, but I have my guffs and I want to share them with you.Without spoiling any of the details of the movie, I will just sum it up that the Sindey character is still the 'target' of the killer, but the main focus of the movie seems to be on the Gail and Dewy characters.  They have almost twice as much screen time as Sindey does.This is a problem.  It seems like the writers couldn't figure anything out for the Sindey character to do.  It's as if they thought Neve Campbell wouldn't do part 3, wrote a script without the Sindey character in it, and when she signed on to do the film, put her in the script anywhere they could.Now for the fun part.  Scream 3 is a lot more scary then the first two were. There were far more ""jumps"" from myself and my friends then there were viewing the first two films.  It's all the classic ""get ready to jump out of your seat"" stuff that horror movies make their money on, but far more false starts then any other scary movie then I have ever seen!  By false starts I mean ""YIKES, IT'S THE KILLER!  No wait, that's not the killer... YIKES!"" You get it.  Be ready to be on the edge of your seat at all times.  Avoid holding an open container!Now here comes the big letdown: the ending.  The first Scream had a wonderful ending.  The second Scream had a very bad ending.  Scream 3's ending was down right awful.  Be set to be disappointed.
Still, anyone who likes the ""jumps"" that horror movies provide, then Scream 3 is right for you.  This is a must see for people who enjoyed the first two, simply because this is it for the series... I hope.",Scream 3

487,MagnusBuchan,Probably the biggest cop-out I've ever seen,1,5 February 2000,"*****WARNING:  SPOILERS*****As Randy says in a video tape he so luckily made before he was offed in Scream 2, anyone, including the lead actor/actress, can die.  A cop (Good to see Patrick Dempsey working again) says to Sidney, for the final chapter of a trilogy, all bets are off.  These two scenes got my hopes up.  This movie should have ended with Sidney being the killer.  Or Gale or Dewey, the only returning cast after Cotton gets it in the first five minutes.  Or at least one of these (Sidney, Gale or Dewey) people should have died.  They needed to die or kill.  This would have given Scream 3, the final movie of the trilogy, enough oomph to be different than the other two.  To be better than the second (As if that would have been a challenge).  Even better than the first, which actually would have been tough to do.  Instead, we get a film that is worse than it's predecessors.  Why, you ask?  Simple.  It's a sissified cop-out.  Aside from not even being scary at all, (O.K., in Dewey's trailer when Patrick Warburton gets it made me jump) the only people who die in this load of crap are bit players.  People you barely see and don't have any clue who the hell they are.  So why should I care if they die?  They're new, one dimensional characters, who've been on screen for about 4 minutes a piece.  Then we get to the end.  The biggest dissapointment of an ending I have seen in a long damn time.  The killer is a new character to the trilogy (I'm telling you, it shouldn't have been someone new), and again, one that's on screen for literally 10-11 minutes before he's unmasked.  And then, it turns out it's Sidney's god damned long, lost brother, who it turns out, had Maureen Prescott killed before the events in the original Scream.  Of course, Sidney saves the day.  Boring. Boring, boring, boring.  And then, to add unexcusable sap to a let down, Dewey proposes to Gale, the woman who was broken his heart twice already. This scene was just too much.  Overall, what a crock of shit.  Ehren Kruger, who wrote a great movie and excellent ending for Arlington Road, should have done better.  Instead, he wusses out.  Think about it, after the events in the first two movies, Sidney snaps and by the third movie...is the killer!!! That would rock!  Or how about this...Gale Weathers, wanting a pulitzer prize so bad, dons the mask and knife and begins murdering just to get a story!!  Or Dewey, having his heart broken by Gale twice now, snaps and begins a killing spree!!! (O.K., sure that's a little weak, but still...) Those would have been great endings.  Plus, it would have gotten originality points, of which Scream 3 gets 1/2 out of a possible 5 in my book (Getting 1/2 a point, even though it was lame, for the long, lost brother which was at least somewhat creative). Now, why is it a cop-out, you ask?  Simple. All those annoying teeny-boppers who are getting picked up by your moms outside the theater right after the movie in the Winstar minivan, so they can all pick up their soccer uniforms we unfortunately have to share a theater with would whine and complain about how much ""it like totally blew"" that this movie had the courage to do something different and kill off/make the killer one of the main characters because a few 7th graders don't like anything new or dark.  Damn shame.  Oh well, at least it wasn't as bad as the I know what you did last summer movies.",Scream 3
488,mwzeininger,A great final chapter,10,9 February 2000,"This final chapter, following the brilliant original and the fun and exciting second film, puts on the finishing touches.  And in doing so, we're given scares, laughs, and a bit of nostalgia.  I can still remember seeing the original for the first time.  It was so amazing.  Here, we're reminded of the original, with the film-within-the-film involving Woodsboro and the plot going back to where it all began.  Neve is tough and fun to watch, Courteney and David are obviously enjoying themselves, and the new people, namely Parker Posey, Scott Foley, and Jenny McCarthy, are game for the series.  The opening carries on the scary-as-hell tradition, and it concludes with a bang.  I never would have guessed that this is where the Scream story would end up, but it is a good place to be.  It's bittersweet to have the trilogy all under my belt now, with no more new films to see, but they're an excellent trio of films, and they'll never bore me.

I actually understood the parts and some killings better.  But there has been some contoversy over the realisticness of the film.  Let me give you people some of my defensive ideas:1) The voice changer IS a real thing 2) The killer got Maureen's voice during the same time he tried to find her. When she rejected him, he directed Billy to kill her. 3) Roman is Sid's half brother; he was concieved when Maureen went to Milton's mansion to sleep with all the other guys.  Roman's father is unknown, as it was just random man that she slept with. 4) People thought Roman died, and were confused when he turned out to be the killer.  This was because he is a DIRECTOR, therefor he easily created the fake body with the knife wound.  He also used a styrofoam head, so when Gale knocked the guillotine, it chopped of a fake head.

In general its a let down the story has never been mentioned before its completely new and its just been used to make a lot of money it tied up a few things but things which didn't need to be.  The special effects used on the ghost were not needed and really ruined the film.  But as i said i am a massive fan of the Scream trilogy and looking back it seems better, go and see it make your own mind up.  Plus i heard reports on the net and papers about a clause in Neve Campbell's contract which didn't come true and that shocked me the ending could be used to make another i hope not though.",Scream 3

It was the same plot pretty much as the first one. The killer wants Sydney Prescott (Neve Cambel)and only her and kills anyone in their way.  It is always the same voice, same accent or whatever whether it is female or male.  But Anywho, Somebody is killing cause of somebody else and they are depressed, cause so and so ruined there lives and there after her cause she is the daughter.  Just like in the S2. I can just see if they make a p.4 it will be Syndeys father trying to kill her cause her mother was a tramp, her boyfriend was a murderer, and her other boyfriend was a psychotic, and so on and so forth.",Scream 3

Neve Campbell & Courtney Cox were Great (as always). The only thing that I didn't like was the opening.

When I saw Scream 2 I thought that it was great also, and it also (like Scream) made it into my TOP 10. I have waited for Scream 3 to come out since I saw the 2nd one, and I had really big expectations from the 3rd one. When it came out, I saw it on the opening night - I just couldn't wait to see it, and after 2 hours of watching I'm glad to say that Scream 3 is the BEST movie EVER!!! The movie is very clever, funny, and really scary (although the first one was the scariest). Big part of the movie is about the new movie 'Stab 3', and we actually see all the actors that play the real characters from the 'Scream' movies. Neve Campbell is excellent as usual, and Sidney is again, one of the best characters in the movie. Courtney Cox (Arquette) is also great and she has great chemistry with  Davis Arquette. The best newcomer to the movie is Parker Posey. She is funny and a very good character. As for the killer, it reminded a little of the killer from Scream 2, but anyway, I thought it was a good ending. GO SEE IT! My rate: 5/5",Scream 3
496,jay1207,Not what I expected...,2,15 February 2000,"After seeing Scream I was blown away.  It was very original and added a new twist to the slasher genre which made it fun again.  Scream 2 was not that good, but since I heard it was the second in a trilogy I allowed it because the second one is never the best.  Unfortunately, I had myself extremely hyped for the third in the trilogy.  I expected it to be at least as good if not better than Scream.  Man was I wrong...  Technically, besides really bad acting in some instances, there is nothing wrong with Scream 3.  Everyone who has watched and studied Scream as many times as I has knows that one of the most important parts in that movie was the unexpected ending that no one saw coming.  It was almost like a mystery more than a slasher.  Scream 3 works fairly well during the beginning and middle, but the end falters in such a big way that it destroys the rest of the movie.  The end of the movie turns Scream 3 into exactly what the series has tried to parody, a tired cliche of the horror genre.  Anyone who had high expectations for this will be really disappointed.  I suggest you save your seven bucks and go rent Scream again.",Scream 3

This one was better then the second one but not as good as the first I believe.",Scream 3
498,bud2401,"Its Awesome, despite what the critics are saying.",10,11 February 2000,"Trust me, anyone who loves horror (especially the Scream films or Wes Cravens work) will love this movie.  I've read, however, some really up and down reviews about the movie, and what it boils down to: movie go-ers love it, critics are bashing it.  These web reviews and newspaper reviews I've read for the past three or four days (Houston Chronicle for example) are coming from columnists or critics that could not give a rats ass about the genre, and I promise, they dont know what they're talking about.  They are saying that they are sick of horror films, and that its time for Wes Craven and the boys at Mirimax films to ""hang it up"" for a while, but trust me from the way they talk about the film and what they were complaining about, they wouldnt know a really GOOD horror sequel like this one, if it landed out of the sky and screwed their face!  This movie is being reviewed by people who get paid to write these summaries on movies, but they hate horror, or they hate Stallone movies, or who knows what.  These columnists cannot take an unbiased approach to criticizing anything.  They also go on to say that the movie was predictable, and the ending was an utter disappointment, but my question to them is, DID YOU WATCH THE LAST TWO?  I would like you to go find another horror movie sequel that the same characters were played by the same actors, the story stayed together and the turn of events that were laid out in the original were tied together in the finale, where the intensity and violence stayed consistent and the villain isnt mocked by every 17 year old in the country at summer camp, and were two sequels were PLANNED from the beginning and before the creation of the original.  If you think someone else or another film or director could have done it better in this genre, youre poorly mistaken.  Cox-Arquette, Arquette, Campbell, and Parker Posey are terrific.  The movie opens with a bang (much like the original) and has and ending that makes you think ""damn, i was wrong the whole time! i should have known it was him/her/them.""  Bottom line: f*** the critics, if you liked scream and/or scream 2, you will LOVE this one.",Scream 3
499,bud2401,"Scream 3, the end of a good thing.",10,8 June 2000,"Sure the movie had its typical sequel problems, but they were minimal flaws in comparison to ANY other franchise in this genre.  It was a good look at how each of the surviving characters in the story had changed, and where the problems in the original ""Scream"" started.  It kept the pieces together, and the story intact.  It still manages to pull MANY inside jokes, while at the same time giving you chills as the killer continues his vengence.  Scream 3 is in no way better than the original, but FAR superior to Scream 2, and any other horror sequel for that matter.  Alot of movie-goer's complained that Scream 2 and Scream 3 were stupid or not scary.  But trust me, those people are not true fans of the series, direction, writing, or cast.  They're just there to watch a movie.  So, please pay no attention.  Scream gave horror a much needed boost in the late 90's and spawned 2 years worth of copy-cat films.  I think what a lot of people just don't get, is that Scream had two sequels from the beginning.  These were planned sequels, not merely attempts to fool us into buying more movie tickets and popcorn, but rather a very long horror movie/story that the producers found could be told in three parts allowing more detail and emphasis per movie/story.  Hollywood has just about finished its horror/teen flick run.  Scream 3 is definitely the end of a good thing.",Scream 3

With most horror films that I have seen I have always felt that their plots were always very weak. I also never really seemed to care about the characters. But with Scream 3 I really enjoyed all aspects of the film. The more in depth you create a character the more you empathise with them and root for their survival and I felt like Scream 3 did a great job of achieving this.  Of the three, this one was by far my favourite.",Scream 3

It's watchable enough if you've nothing better to do but isn't nearly as fun as Scream 1 or 2. David Arquette comes off the best with some amusing lines but the Agatha Christie style plotting which means that the screenwriters can conveniently pick anyone they want to be the killer and explain it in the final reel with a lengthy monologue is, quite frankly, annoying. Also this film must hold the record for the biggest use of breakable glass and pots. Not scary, not funny and not a great deal of fun. Wait for it on video.",Scream 3

Well, i entered in the cinema.. The people screaming and etc... Then the lights turn out and the Dimension Films logo appear, i was really excited!! Then the first scare came out! The Killer! Christine death was a little bad but Cotton's death was just perfect!!! ¡Snikt¡ the killer stab Cotton... the blood jumps out of his body and start the final chapter of the trilogy that made you laugh and made you scream!!!For next we have a bunch of craziness and non-sense comedy then starts the really bad part of the film, when the characters start to been kill'd like chicken's in a farm!!! First Sarah Darling, then a lot of characters that are in the film simply just to die, but in the finish when idney( Neve Campbell in a perfect interpretation!!) comes out to save everybody, and the SCREAMs, the SCARES and evrything starts again! For the last time!Finally SCREAM 3 is a very good movie, with a non-good script, but ends the Trilogy with that same old Halloween charm!! And one thing that i found just soooo funny, is that when David Arquette finished to make the last scene( the one that he propose Gale) he said ""I want to make it registered in celluloid that I think that know is the perfect moment to the killer came back and kill all the characters!!!""",Scream 3
504,klemencerne,"Oh my god, what have they done?!!",4,26 December 2000,"First of all I must say that I consider myself as one of the greatest fans of the first part of Scream trilogy. I watched it 17 times and I know every detail of it. Second part was quite good but not so special, which left me a little disappointed. For that I had even lower expectations for the final part. And still it managed to p*** me off!!! They ruined the whole trilogy with this nonsense. O.K. let me start at the beginning.SPOILER ALERT!!! Drew Barrymore's opening death was scary, unique and special. It is considered a classic. Than here is Jada Pinket's cinema death in sequel which succeeded to scare me as well. And what about Scream 3? Opening killing was part of Scream's charm and even here they totally blew it. It was the most  boring, scareless and ordinary of all deaths in previous two parts. And remember, that is only first 5 minutes. Than it goes even worse. The whole script was bad and after a while you get a feeling that you are watching a stupid comedy. I was laughing out loud during the scene with a spinning knife and I must remember you, laughing isn't the most common behavior while you are watching horror movies. Another thing let me down and that was movie knowledge and movie quotes. It's true that there are some facts about final parts of triology (actually the only bright part of the movie were Randy's rules on a videocassette), which is funny if you consider a fact that the whole movie is happening in a film studio. And a thing with a voices. Instead using scary Scream voice the killer uses copies of character's voices, which is not only impossible but also stupid.Lets move on to the characters. I love Neve Campbell but Sidney has lost her charm and is it just me or she is not a main person anymore. I know that this whole thing is about her but Dewey and Gale have had more actual time on the screen, like someone cares about their romantic problems. Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Sidney in the first part said that it is stupid that girl runs into the house while she is trying to escape from the killer, cause that's  what she did now.I saved the final cut for the end. Who did it? Who is the killer? Who is behind the mask? Oh, it's just Sidney's insane half brother. Like someone didn't know that. The fact that confused me was that there was only one killer, who managed to do all the work without the partner. My second guess was a cop. When Dewey pointed at him because of the phone he took, his explenation was something like ""I'm a cop, not a bad guy. You can trust me."" O.K. Now we believe him. And that thing with changing events from the first part. It's very thrilling that Crawen was thinking about trilogy from the beginning and it would be fine to me if this final part was a wee bit better, but how can this crap changes a beauty of the original, tell me please! I think I'm going to stay with the original story and forgot about that cinema incident. Oh, and another thing. The scaryest person was not a killer in a white mask but Gail Weathers wannabe actress played by Parker Posey. My advise, if you have a chance to watch this so called movie, don't! Stay at home for god sake and rent a first Scream, you will feel much better.",Scream 3

Mainly because I am so sick of the same characters in every one, but also because they ruin it with new ones. What a surprise it is that Sidney, Gale and Dewey survive(!) In fact in the final scene I almost was happy when Sidney was shot, but not surprised as she miraculously survived. (How come they were too stupid not to shoot for the head?).The story line was seriously screwed up with...no storyline?! Except for the usual. Oh come on! Roman, the killer!? It's pathetic. They couldn't have tried a little harder could they?! He turns out to be her brother! I think they struggled for an ending so just settled for the most stupid ending they could rush through. They could have at least used someone we didn't suspect from the start. Why didn't they have Kincaid as her brother instead? Or Angelina as her sister!? But Roman!? Why!?

As exciting the breath of fresh air Scream brought to the silver screen and particularly the horror genre, Scream 3 leaves a terribly bitter aftertaste like something that has been cooked to death. The momentus build up to the release of this film and the subsequent fact that it was the last in a silly trilogy that would tie up all the loose ends lying around like carved up crab sticks from the previous two. Firstly, Scream 3 only goes furthur to throw more confusion into an already warped out melting pot and secondly the neat little tie in's to previous instalments of the franchise are about as substandard as a morning episode of Hanna-Baberra's Scooby Doo mysteries. If this was the best whopper they could come up with to finally wrap things up, these film should be re-classified as comedies for our future generations to laugh at. As Scream opened the floodgates to zillions of other imitators, hopefully the big surprise to come from this film is that no other future Hollywood studio may make another slasher flick involving teens or psychotic villians in ridiculous masks.

So i had pretty high expectations for scream 3. My friends and I bought our tickets in advance and got their early and were just extremely excited. I sat during the movie with a horrible glare on my face. I left completely furious. Everything about this movie was horrible. <not to ruin the ending for anyone.. because the ending ruins itself> but I thought that was the weakest ending i had EVER heard. I honestly think they had a five year old write the script. They tried too hard to add humor. they had their ""token black guy"" who of course died. Every character in the movie was horribly written. They HAD no character. I was horrified by every aspect of the film. I couldn't believe somebody allowed for them to film this piece of trash.

512,adt4m,Trilogy that influenced my life,8,3 April 2004,"This trilogy changed the way I look at life.These films show that the line between fiction and reality, between art and life, and between cinema and our lives is blurry at best. In the world of Williamson, life can follow the conventions of films, or it can completely dilineate from them. Young men in love can leap onto a table and sing to the object of their affection, and those around them will support this impromptu musical sequence. Some of us are supporting cast; others are the main character, a person of tragic drama. And the ending- well, that's never written for us. In 1996 Kevin Williamson took the conventions of horror films- and, specifically, teen slasher films- added his own Dawson-style teen drama and wonderfully crisp dialogue- and created one of the most self-aware and entertaining films ever made. In 97 he continued his franchise with Scream 2, a film that fails to live up to the giddy greatness of the original but which still manages to bring the above aspects back in a strong way. And now we come to this third and final installment to the trilogy. This third chapter has some weak points: unfortunately, for one, Williamson did not write it (although he had the idea, and the whole trilogy idea, in his head from the get-go), so it lacks his level of teen drama, self-awareness and dialogue. But this can be seen as a good thing- Scream 3 takes place in the world after high school and college, so the absence of teen drama seems fitting, if not necessary, and as for the self-aware ingenuity and dialogue, this film delivers in a strong way. The makers of Scream 3 not only understand the essence of Williamson's trilogy, but they also obviously use care and skill in crafting a fitting conclusion to his franchise. Bravo! 8 out of 10",Scream 3

Well, maybe the whole 'serial killer reveal' was not as predictable in the second one. But that's just because it was completely random.The only thing that makes these movies worth watching is the adorably dysfunctional chemistry between Courteney Cox Arquette's obsessive character Gale Weathers and David Arquette's gimpy character Dewey Riley.

And SCREAM 2 was even a lot more suspenseful than the original. These two movies were written by Kevin Williamson, and they had a very simple formulaic structure. Unfortunately, Williamson was not available to pen the third and final script of the series, so, Ehren Kruger was signed on to write it. His SCREAM 3, in the end, tried so hard to copy Williamson's style of writing, but did not succeed.He got the opening sequence right. A couple is attacked by a menacing caller. But he got the murders wrong. In both SCREAM and SCREAM 2, the boyfriend dies first. In SCREAM 3, the girlfriend dies first.Sidney is no longer the main character. SCREAM 3 focuses more on Dewey and Gale and the cast and crew of ""Stab 3"", the movie within a movie. This may be because Neve Campbell, who plays Sidney, was only available for 20 days. Plus, she lost interest in playing the same character.Randy comes back in a videotape to give the rules in surviving a trilogy. In the first SCREAM and SCREAM 2, he references to horror movies. But in SCREAM 3, he does not use horror movie references, he uses ""The Godfather"" and ""Star Wars"" trilogies. Randy says that trilogies are a rarity in the horror genre, but they DO exist. So, why didn't he reference those horror movies? Such as the Evil Dead trilogy? There were always two killers in SCREAM and SCREAM 2. But in SCREAM 3, there's only one killer.In both of SCREAM and SCREAM 2, the span of the movie was 3 nights and 2 days.

Scream, Scream 2, and Scream 3 are my most favorite horror movies, next to Freddy vs. Jason. The goofs in Scream 3 are a little too noticeable, but the movie in all was still pretty good. My favorite character in these movies is Randy Meeks. He is hilarious, and knows a lot about horror movies, just like me. Scream 3 isn't really the best Scream movie in the trilogy, though. If I said it was, I was mistaken. Scream 1 is the best in my opinion. All the stuff in that movie is new to us when we first watched it. We didn't know who was who, or who was a main character.

There were many other things that were funny as well, such as scenes like when Gail meets Gail, where a knife is thrown at Dewey's head (trust me, may sound scary, but if you keep your eyes open you're in for a great laugh), and Psycho refrences in the end.

The series went from being smart and funny to an unoriginal slasher movie that was mocked in the original. It seems they just added a higher body count to make up for the lack of a good script. At least I cared or knew something about the victims in the previous two but I was just glad or just plain forget who most of the victims were in this one.

The whole set is not scary ( slasher-I'm-gonna-rip-your-insides-out ) but there's many BOOM ZING CRACK POW along your trip to find who is the mysterious killer ( are they 2 ? Can it be Sidney ? Or Gale ? God ... I'm confused ). Talking of the ending, ( don't worry I'm not going to reveal anything ) it is kinda odd, there's a side of it which is : "" Cool, great idea"" and ""uh? well ok then, if you say so"", but I liked it eitherway.To make some sense to my review, Scream 3 is purely entertainement, with good ideas, nothing more, 10 / 10 for the genre, 7 / 10 for the global thing, I maybe be too much generous. It supplants all the imitations Urban Legend, I know what you did last summer and all the siameses that Scream gave birth to )Inconditional fans will be on exctasy for a full 120 minutes.P.S. Do not close your eyes or block your ears during the representation for a complete and full satisfying experience.What's left ?Scream.",Scream 3
522,Stringy-3,The best horror film of the year!!!,10,18 February 2000,"I'm a big fan of the Scream trilogy and I thought it was the best horror film of the year and the best movie to end the trilogy. Neve Campbell was great in this movie! She can still kick some ass and Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette were very funny together.

Much like Scream 2, I found that I didn't really CARE who the Scream 3 killer was.  When we did find out, I was very disappointed.  It felt cheap and contrived, and there were too many plot holes.Of note to Neve Campbell fans, Sidney Prescott is little more than a sideline character, despite being referred to in the movie as the ""main character.""",Scream 3

From its non-humorous dialog to its fragmented plot, this film does not do much justice to the 'Scream' franchise.  If this is to complete the 'Scream' story, then I hope that Williamson does to the franchise what he did to the 'Halloween' franchise, completely ignore the piece of trash that this sequel is and write a new conclusion.

Thanks to Arlington Road and John Frankenheimer i still have hope for ehren kruger and Reindeer Games.  But Scream 3 is a big let down. Because Scream is one of my favorite movies I was hoping Scream 3 would be the ultimate sequel where anything goes and all the horror movie rules established in the first two Screams would be turned on their heads and smashed into pieces. But instead of a memorable or  original conclusion to what could have been an excellent trilogy  we get in Scream 3 a rehash of the 2 movies that came before it.  Which means almost exactly the same jokes and scare tactics. There weren't even any cool death sequences.  The only thing I liked about this movie, besides jay and silent bob, was that the the guy who just appeared to be a caricature of quentin tarantino turned out to be the killer. that's about the only unexpected thing that happens in scream 3 and it's ruined when we find out who this guy really is and the fact that he just happens to be a Hollywood director who is directing a movie that is being produced by his father (who conveniently doesn't know he hired his son) based on a string of murders he started. Sounds silly when you think about it, doesn't it?  Boo Scream 3, they should make a better one and just forget this one ever happened like everybody does with Halloween 3.",Scream 3

529,BuffyMan,The Best Of The Trilogy,10,29 February 2000,"Scream 3 REALLY Rocks!! It's so good!! It's the best one of the trilogy. Although the first one is awesome, this one's too. Neve Campbell has improved a lot like actress, and the Courteney Cox - David Arquette (Gale & Dewey) relationship is so funny, i'm so glad they got married in real life. At first I thought that Sidney hadn't a storyline, cuz she's not in the movie like for the first 45 minutes!! But, in that time, the Dewey - Gale relationship is very well developed, and the resting hour is mainly about Sid...Well, I just want to say GO SEE IT!!! It's the best one YET!!!",Scream 3

I won't give away a thing, but Scream 3 tied up most of the loose ends, and was good till the end. My daughter and I are both movie buffs, and had planned on this one for awhile. We almost went thru the line again, but it was sold out. I expect it to make a ton of money, cus this one has legs. I enjoyed Scream. Scream 2 was a bit of a let down, but Scream 3 was I think the best of the bunch. I am glad it was a Trilogy (don't ya know they have different rules than sequals <G>).",Scream 3

It lacked a certain horror genre of the first two movies.  I appreciated the ""comical"" outlet however, it was a little over done.  This movie seemed to be missing something the first two had.  The first two left us guessing up until the end and showed more ""creepy details"" than this one, not to mention they could have gotten better cast members to play the characters in the ""movie within the movie"", although Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox-Arquette, and David Arquette did do a good job as usual.Since I purchased the first two movies I will purchase this one (after all it is a trilogy) when it comes to video as it wasn't too bad, but my recommendation folks is don't waste your money at the theater, wait for video.",Scream 3
533,staros_14,SPOILERS AHEAD!!! I really hated this film...,2,5 February 2000,"Again, there are spoilers in this; stop reading NOW if you haven't seen the movie yet (better yet, don't see the movie ever). This was by far the worst of the Scream trilogy.  The first two were scary, funny, and clever.  This was horrid.  I didn't care about ANY of the characters that died.  They didn't kill off any of the main characters as Randy suggested in his videotape (if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean).  The only good part was the videotape by Randy.  I realized that Jamie Kennedy really was the comic relief of the series, and the movie suffered not having him in it since he'd died.  At least he was in it for the cameo.  The Silent Bob and Jay cameo was funny too, now that I think about it.  The movie overall was plotless, not at all scary, and had THE most disappointing ending I've ever seen.  I mean, the whole ""I am your brother"" ending was extremely contrived, and the last scene was overly sappy. All I can think to say is ICK.  See the first two if you want clever, scary satire; if you want an example of what the first two were satarizing, see this.",Scream 3
534,rmforden,Good but a lame ending.,8,7 February 2000,"This may continue minor spoliers but I will not give away the endScream 3 reminded me a lot of Scream 2.  The pace of the movie was right on. It was suspenseful, scary and funny.  But like the 2nd in the series the ending was quite a let down.  Once the killer was exposed the move lost all energy because of the poor choice.  Besides that it was a very cleaver, fun movie.  GO see it.",Scream 3
535,john120381,Best Movie Ever,10,4 February 2000,"Scream 3 was a great movie.  A lot of humor for a horror movie.  Overall it was great.  I give it 4/5 stars.  A little confusing at some parts, but if you are a Scream fan, this is a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. I had my doubts at first but it was a great movie. Courtney Cox Arquette looked a little sickly in the movie but was great.  Neve Campbell was great and so was David Arquette was great too.  Everyone: Go See the movie ASAP.",Scream 3
536,btwright,Wow,10,4 February 2000,I just got back from watching this and... wow. I expected some cheese and a little bit of light amusement. Instead I got what I consider to be one of the best of the trilogy. Randy's advice from the grave was great. My only complaint was the way the supporting cast was shuffled off to the side after a while. And it's about time some one figured out that a handgun might just be a good defense against a knife... especially if every time you turn around your friends are getting turned into fish food. Overall a great film and as Wes Craven's last horror movie (by his own words) a fine way to go out.,Scream 3
537,Vitros,I miss you Kevin Williamson. Spoilers included...,6,6 February 2000,"I'm a huge fan of the first two Scream movies along with horror films in general so therefore I was greatly anticipating the release of the third. I was slightly disappointed when I heard that Kevin Williamson would not be writing Scream 3 but I figured that since Wes Craven was directing it would still be pretty good.  Boy, was I wrong.  From the very opening it was evident that the movie was missing Williamson's touch.  I agree with the fact that some of the big name characters in the movie should have been killed off but opening it with Cotton getting slashed was a bad move.The acting in Scream 3 was sad, even for a horror film.  Neve Campbell and Lance Henriksen were the only two in the movie who acted like they wanted to be there.  The fact that Neve did a great job again was odd considering all the fuss she made about even wanting to appear in the third installment. Again, I think the reason for the poor acting is due to the fact that Kevin Williamson did not write the script.  They were his characters and they seemed flat without him giving them life.I also thought this was the least ""scary"" of the three films.  There were a few moments of tension however.  The scene where Sid was dreaming and her mother appeared in a zombie type why was somewhat creepy.  Also, Sid's recollection of the events of Scream in her room on the set of Stab 3 provided some chilling moments.  Unfortunately, the movie tries to scare the audience by using the sudden entrance of an actor into the frame followed by the ""stinger"" of music blaring throughout the theater.  This is a poor technique and really gets old when done as many times as it is in this movie.   I view it as a bale out attempt by the writer or director or whoever when they can't think of anything else to do in order to scare the audience.For some reason, however, I gave the movie a 6 out of 10.  Probably because there are some well written things in the story and because it has the Scream name and Wes Craven's attached to it.  I know that is pretty sad reasoning but it's the only thing I can think of. I guess I could go on about how bad some things are in the movie and even how some things are done well, but it's not worth it.  I recommend that you see the movie for yourself and form your own opinion.  At least, hopefully, this is the last installment of the series.  Please, Wes, do not do a ""Wes Craven's New Scream"" or anything along those lines.  Just let the trilogy be as it is. Those last two lines go for any other director or producer at Miramax wanting to resurrect the series.",Scream 3
538,jonesee1,"Not as good as the original, but still provides plenty of scares.",8,5 February 2000,"""Scream 3"" grabs you from the get-go.  It delivers more ""screams"" - and laughs - than the second, but in my opinion does not top the original. People thought that in this movie, Sidney Prescott moves to Hollywood to become an actress.  Not true.  Following a string of murders directly related to the script of ""Stab 3,"" the movie-within-a-movie, Sidney comes to Hollywood to try to shed any light she can on the murders, and perhaps stop the killer once and for all. ""Scream 3"" definitely delivers good old-fashioned scares from beginning to end, and also delivers an intricate plot, which keeps you guessing, and brings closure to the previous 2 movies.",Scream 3

544,sassymaz,WHY I LOVE THIS FILM ****SPOILER WARNING****,10,7 February 2000,"OK. so I have been taking a lot of crap for totally loving this film. But there is method behind my madness. First of all you must understand that the original is my favorite movie.Part of the reason why I loved this one so much is because of how well it ties into that one. With all of the trouble in Woodsboro circling around Sid's mom, it's only natural that they return to the roots to tie up all loose ends. Think back...as we all no Maureen Prescott had some, well issues, with her sexualtiy. An illegitimate son is not that far fetched. In the original, when Sid and Billy are making out in Stu's house he tells her, and I quote, "" It's all a movie, Sid. It's all one great big movie."" Now, how fitting is it that the culprit behind all of Sidney's misery turns out to be a director.Billy also states the, ""maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior,"" which is exactly the source of the killer's anger in this one. It's basically what strted it all. And I personally find the idea of an overall mastermind a novel one. Add Jamie Kennedy's cameo as Randy to explain the rules of a trilogy, and you have me hooked. Although Kevin Williamson didn't write it, Krueger had a well enough perception of who Sidney, Gale, and Dewey were to close there story as it should. In fact I think he gave it the extra dramatic edge it needed to be more than just the spoofy horror flick this series started out as.I feel for Sidney through the whole thing and i never doubt the fact that Gale and Dewey are meant for eachother. I really did love this movie...I guess that's it. I rest my case..",Scream 3

There are great surprises and jumps throughout the film, however, I made it back to the car in the dark without even once feeling compelled to turn around in fear of some impending doom--a feeling I always get after any good horror movie. The Scream series' trademark ""Scooby Doo"" endings have always  kept the audience from successfully guessing the true killer until the crucial unveiling point, and the best job of this element was demonstrated in the last part of the trilogy. It seemed, however, that Scream 3 focused more on confusing the audience, rather than frightening it. If this was the goal of the film, then Bravo!

Scream 3, wasn't really that scary at all. I really wish that Kevin Williamson had written this movie. You can really tell that it isn't him. The movie was good, but it didn't keep me at the edge of my seat. It went more for the laughs, instead of the throat, like the others did. This could have been a great film, except that there were too many characters. And most of them were underdeveloped. Most of them just stood around to be killed. In the first movie, you got to feel for the characters, and were upset when they died. In this movie, it was ""Wait, who was he again?"" And in the commercials, everyone was talking about some huge secret that would bring everything together. But when I heard it, I was thinking ""So? THAT'S IT?!?!"" I have to say that I was really disappointed with this movie.

Actually I like all three Screams, but Scream 3 is the only Scream I have ever seen in the cinema. Did I miss something!!! If I had seen all three in the cinema, the comparison would be more honest. But anyway, back to Scream 3.The fact that Sydney has a brother is very original, but it makes it harder for the viewer to predict a killer. And that in Scream 1 and 2 there where two killers, makes it logical to think that in Scream 3 there are also two killers.  That is the first thing I like about the movie.The second thing is that the main characters (Sid, Dewey, Gale and Cotton) are played by the same actors as in the first two episodes. And the last last thing: ""SEQUALS DON'T SUCK!!!!!!!""",Scream 3
556,pandabear2003,DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH!!!(potential spoiling),3,27 May 2000,"To me, and the majority of people, this movie definitely wasn't that great at all. I had great expectations for Scream 3, seeing as how part 1 and 2 were pretty good. I even thought up my own plot for it which was where Gail Weathers was the killer with someone else because she wanted to have stories she could report on and make books one. Dewey would find out it's her but too late because she would kill off Sydney, and then would have to kill her. That's not my whole plot but the main idea of it. Scream 3 was a HUGE disappointment. Here are some reasons why: - a different script writer... WHY? :( - Sydney doesn't have a big enough part - plot doesn't really make sense - no main characters die (except Cotton) I think Sydney should've died - too many new people - only the new peope die - the deaths aren't gory enough*
*What I mean here is that the killer just went stab stab and the person died. In part 1 and 2 the killings wee more bizarre. Like in part one when Drew Barrymore's mom listens to her being dragged on the grass and then finds her hung. In part two when Jada Pinkett is dying in the theater but everyone else thinks she's just acting it out. The garage door, etc. - not enough suspense - a main character should have been a killer - only one killer, not two - too much confusing and stupid past crap about her mom and her death - not a good enough motive - what's with Courtney's hair??? There are more reasons but none I can think of now. I watched the movie last night and nothing really stands out in the movie that I can remember as being scary or that totally made me jump out of my seat.The one part i liked was when Jenny McGarthy was in the room full of the ghost mask costumes and then one moves. Well I don't want to give away the killer if anyone wants to see it. They ended the trilogy so that they could make a fourth movie... PLEASE DON'T IT WOULD WRECK IT MORE.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, don't expect a freaky, wow i didn't think he'd die movie, and I would say it was a total waste of time and money.

563,maspears_tsy,I thought this movie was the best one...shouldn't have stopped here!,10,24 August 2001,"SPOILER Scream three kept you in suspense the most.  Who was there left to want Sidney dead?  In Scream it was her boyfriend and his twisted friend Stu. In scream 2 it was Billy's mom, in a way it was suspected to be her cause a mother is going to want revenge.  Of course no one thought it was that nobody reporter that showed up every where.  So who was left?  Her brother that no one knew existed... I thought it was great and there should have been more to follow up.",Scream 3
564,donnawmoody,Mistunderstood,8,14 August 2021,"I try to be as honest as I can when reviewing Movies and I must say that this is a classic. A ""must have"" movie for anyone who likes scary movies. I will say that Most movies get worse as the sequels come out but this one is just as good as the first one. I have all of the Scream movies and I would recommend them to anyone who has not seen them or to anyone who does not own them. One of my favorite (3s) of a series.",Scream 3
565,odelyau,Not as bad as some say,6,19 August 2021,"The film isn't as bad as people say, but it's still a step down from the other two films. Which is all more disappointing as this was meant to be the final chapter.",Scream 3
566,lanc-31051,So disappointing,5,10 October 2021,Had so much fun expectations but this it's nowhere near as good as the first 2 films.,Scream 3
567,sports_star_roro,shark swarm- lame title but okayish,7,5 July 2008,"overall the movie was pretty good but it was SO INCREDIBLY LONG and so REPTITIVE that. even though i think the scriptwriters wrote an ingenious script, the simple length and repetition bored me to tears. the movie, which starts off with sinister criminals dumping sinister-looking chemicals into the ocean, was a never-ending saga of death by swarming sharks. person after person after person was killed and eaten at sea. it practically never stopped! ever ten minutes in the film another few humans would get eaten.whats more is the people are so stupid! i mean, they're STILL swimming in the ocean after what, at least twenty people go missing in it? and NONE of them think it could be a shark? and that little girl that sees the lifeguard get eaten alive. she doesn't think to maybe, oh i don't know, say something?! the worst aspect though was definitely the number of deaths. people falling, boaters being knocked overboard, sharks biting fishing lines, divers, bathers, lifeguards. there was no end to the people dying!!! and NO ONE even freaks out a little at the huuuuge number of deaths. they just go on swimming. as if about thirty people haven't disappeared.but asides from those aspects, i quite enjoyed this film. not a patch on JAWS but then again, nothing is =) a good film for people that like a thrill but don't want to be majorly scared. and a GREAT cast! put your hands together for shark swarm :)",Scream 3
568,kevKwa,Now it's the final one!,9,31 August 2002,"This third installment of ""Scream"" was making all the sense to me. The survivors of ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" returns to ""Scream 3."" Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox Arquette, Parker Posey, and more. The story begins with the murder of Cotton Weary [Liev Schrieber]as the killer comes back to Sidney's life. This movie 's killer was really hard to figure out because during the movie, Emily Mortimer gets this creepy ""Stab 3"" souvenirs. But it was a pretty fine sequel. Who knows if there's going to be ""Scream 4""?",Scream 3
569,Calliecat7,Awesome Movie,10,22 August 2002,"Scream 3 is one of the BEST slasher movies I have ever seen.  The plot twists keep you guessing ""Who's the Killer"" throughout the whole movie. You never know who the killer is until the very end.  This just might be the best movie in the trilogy!",Scream 3
570,neenhen,I think I did a good job about what I thought of the movie.,10,8 April 2003,"I seen Scream 3 it is a really great movie. It will keep you guessing the whole way through the movie. The killers on the first two Screams I got alot sooner then I did on the third one. Scream 3 keeps you guessing the whole way through you think it is one person then that person gets killed and you have to pick some one else. Screams 3 answers alot of questions I had after watching the first two Screams. I would recomend Scream 3 to any who asked,but first I would tell them to watch the first two before they watched Scream 3 . Otherwise part 3 won't make any sence to any one. I liked the Scream movies so much that i bought the videos and the dvd collection. The cast in all three Screams and the music made you feel what the actors were feeling and also like you were right there with them. One of the great things about these movies is there is no nudity that is very rare for horror movies,but I thought it was just great. The guy who wrote this Kevin williamson really knew how to write a great story. With Wes Craven directing these movies you know they have to be good.",Scream 3
571,Faith-fan,good,9,30 January 2005,"I have to say scream three was the best out of the scream trilogy.With the members of stab 3 dropping dead you never know who is going to drop dead next and with Sidney in hiding , Gale working with the police and Dewey working on set of stab 3 you never know whats going to happen but at the end all the lose ends from the first and second scream finally piece together and the killer will shock you.Scream three brings you thrills, laughter and suspense.I think that the first and second scream were really good but in those two you know that something has not pieced together yet and in scream three it finally does.In most movies they have something thats brings it to life but in scream three that something is fear.",Scream 3
572,fireman_matt1491,"Scream 3/ and the rest of ""horror"" movies!",10,10 August 2005,"i haven't seen this movie but i am all for the scream trilogy...its my favorite. I cant wait...until Scream is back for one more scare...i hop they make a Scream 4! the thrill of a man/woman in a ghost mast scaring people is my idea of a thriller...(laugh out loud)...i cant wait until i see it...the whole idea of the freight factor of someone out to kill you...is very thrilling...so i recommend you try to see as many ""horror"" films you can!! i absolutely love the Halloween movies...and the Friday the 13th movies...and the all so famous Nightmare on Elm Street! you must see them! i swear you will wet the bed...especially in your dreams...(nightmare on elm street)-matt",Scream 3
573,cconsultoria,Really Good Movie,9,10 June 2015,"Well , how can i start , OK , is my first review , I think that Scream 3 is a amazing movie , but i miss a little more of gore ,deads and others , but i think that is a really good movie because it is a good thriller , a perfect movie , i think that scream 2 was best than the scream 3 , i'll watch the scream 4 and write a review , but for me , scream 3 was PERFECT , specially for the final fight of Sidney and ghostface , who surprised me a lot when i discover who is , sidney is always smart and beautiful , a really good actress , anyway , I recommend it for all to see this movie , wes craven another time made a good movie and surprise me again , i'm very excited to see scream 4",Scream 3
574,akyriacoudakingofgreeks,this film rocks,8,16 June 2006,"Let me tell u something right the first scream was fantastic and the second one kind of sucked but it had the best attack scenes ( when there in the car and when gale is in the sound proof glass) and then there's scream 3. This film made everything come together in a great motive and is also the only scream film 2 have 1 killer. And you see why he managed to do everything so brilliantly i mean as he says just give a kid some few pointers and a partner to help him and your all set to go but what really set him off was the video of his father. and its true and then you start to think wow sydney is in a room with the killer who is her half brother and its just them to we are EXPECTING A HUGE 1-1 and you get it they both batter each other until sydney gets shot or dis she . and we see that she has a bullet proof vest and this shows how much she has learnt over the previous attacks.now the scene where roman is nearly bout to die is a fantastic scene because it shows there was sympathy there and that sydney did not want to do it but she had to . So she could end the madness that had haunted her for years. the deaths were the only thing that put me down in this film. because they weren't as big and it did not feel that it had the whole I'm stalking you and your gonna die kind of feeling, it was haha here i am your all gonna die. Bt also this was the only scream where the killer was in the same room with about 5 people and he was in costume. and he delivered a great action scene and to death scenes so all in all this film was brilliant and it also had the most difficulty of finding out who the killer was.",Scream 3
