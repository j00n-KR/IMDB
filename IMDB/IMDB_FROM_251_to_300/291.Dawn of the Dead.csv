0,Leofwine_draca,A different enough remake to be a success,6,29 June 2016,"When I heard that this loose remake of the Romero classic was scripted by the guy who also did SCOOBY DOO, I cried. Then I went to the cinema to see for myself (no matter what reviews might say, it's always worth checking out movies for yourself; sometimes you might be pleasantly surprised). As it stands, DAWN OF THE DEAD is an acceptable remake-cum-horror-thriller which uses the original film as a basis for the story and then moves on from there. Luckily, it's not too similar to the '70s classic; half the film is set in the mall and the rest is an extended chase between humans and zombies. The zombies here are quite good although, I have to say, I prefer the slow-moving variety to the animalistic killers in this and 28 DAYS LATER. Special effects have progressed to a grimly realistic level and the film is packed with enough grue and gore and spraying blood to please any avid horror fan.As a plus, the film retains a grip on characterisation and deals with some fleshed-out people. The acting of the leads is great. Sarah Polley (looking uncannily like Gaylen Ross) is a strong-willed heroine, Ving Rhames is the tough, silent, kick-ass cop. Kudos to Jake Weber for his excellent turn as the group's leader, and especially Michael Kelly, who starts off as an idiot security guard and ends up being the most heroic of them all. Fans of the original will enjoy seeing Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger and Tom Savini in brief cameos on the televisions.I had mixed feelings about the direction, but for the most part it's good. The last half an hour employs camera-shaking, jumpy music-style shots to depict a bus chase. I enjoyed it, but I couldn't have put up with it for that long. There are many enjoyable and surprising moments, like the games played with Andy from the gun store, and the use of a chainsaw which ends in calamity. There's an ambiguous ending, but if you stay and watch the credits you'll see that things become a lot more downbeat. Special effects of the decaying, mutilated zombies are disturbingly real and there are some automobile accidents that'll have you watching with your mouth open. Watch out for the zombies being crushed and mown down by trucks, some of my favourite moments. Particularly good is the first ten minutes, which puts across the hopelessness of the sudden destruction of society in a way I found to be particularly frightening. Strong horror entertainment, hopefully we'll see more like this.",Dawn of the Dead
1,SnoopyStyle,Fast moving zombies in simple story,7,9 March 2014,"Ana (Sarah Polley) is a nurse in Milwaukee who just finished her shift. She's sleeping with her husband and is woken up by a rabid neighbor girl. She goes on the run for her life. After crashing her car, she's joined by cop Kenneth (Ving Rhames), criminal Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant girlfriend, and TV salesman Michael (Jake Weber). They are cut off and decide to hold up in the mall. They find other survivors and are surrounded by zombies.Director Zack Snyder takes the George A. Romero classic icon with James Gunn script, and he injects it with the fast running zombie like '28 Days Later'. It doesn't try to explain away the zombies. It just gets the action started after a short introduction. It's an exciting action start that showcases Snyder's skills. I especially like the zombies really running hard. The story isn't anything original, but it has the sense of suburban reality. The mall looks real although a few brand name stores would help. I like the character work and I like the simplicity of the story. It knows its simplicity and works within its limits.",Dawn of the Dead
2,claudio_carvalho,Excellent Remake of a Classic Horror Movie,8,17 November 2004,"Escaping from an epidemic of zombies, the nurse Ana (Sarah Polley), the police officer Kenneth (Ving Rhames), the Best Buy seller Mike (Jake Weber), the small time crook Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his Russian pregnant girlfriend Luda (Inna Korobkina) seek refuge in an isolated mall. There, they find the three security guards leaded by CJ (Michael Kelly), and after an initial problem between the groups, they join forces trying to survive. From their secluded place, they find another survivor, Andy (Bruce Bohne), living on the roof of his gun store. The group organizes an escape plan to a vessel moored in the marina, trying to find a safer nearby island to live. I hate remakes, but I have to admit that this version of 'Dawn of the Dead' is excellent. Indeed, the writer James Gunn used only George Romero's classic storyline in a totally different screenplay. The zombies in this 2004 version do not move slowly like in the original version and there are lots of characters, instead of only four like in the original version. Both 'Dawn of the Dead' are worthwhile horror movies and highly recommended to any fan of this genre. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Madrugada dos Mortos' ('Dawn of the Dead')",Dawn of the Dead
3,nogodnomasters,She's a twitcher.,7,17 February 2020,"This reboot takes place in Wisconsin instead of Pennsylvania. The zombies are caused by an infection so they run fast unlike the foot draggers in the original. It is all your basic zombie stuff. Ving Rhames eventually leads the group to a supposed island as he does later in Zombie Apocalypse as the search for Catalina. Ana, a nurse is the main character introduced first, so we know she is the final girl. This is the film with a zombie baby.Guide: F-word. Sex and nudity.",Dawn of the Dead
4,kosmasp,Fast & Furious,7,26 November 2011,"If you can get your head around the fact, that this is called ""Dawn of the Dead"" but is more an action movie, rather than a horror movie. Hence do not compare this with the original (Romero) Dawn! It works pretty good as an action movie. Zombies that can run, may or may not be your thing (I'm still with the slow ones). Social criticism has gone (almost completely) AWOL, but it is still nice to see at least one familiar face (Ken Foree that is).I really dug this movie although I am really big fan of the Original. But as I have said before, you can't compare the movies. And even though I haven't seen the Day of the Dead remake (haven't heard nothing good about it at all), I'm pretty sure this is one of the better remakes of Romero movie (even or because it does not try to imitate it).",Dawn of the Dead
5,classicsoncall,"""When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the Earth.""",4,5 July 2018,"If you need to know the plot for this film it's really very simple. Put a group of non-infected humans together and have them shoot as many zombies in the head as possible in a hundred and ten minute time span. It's no more complicated than that. My viewing was of the director's cut, with Zack Snyder's introduction stating how there were additional dead bodies and character development the theatrical version didn't have. Character development? That must have been when Ana (Sarah Polley) shared a romantic moment with Michael (Jake Weber) before she knew that he'd been bitten during one of the undead skirmishes. Didn't Ana's husband turn into a zombie only like about, what - six hours earlier? That must have been a solid marriage. Look, I know there's a fan base for this stuff, and because I'm not a member, I just don't get the fascination. For the rest, have fun, if that's what you get out of it.",Dawn of the Dead
6,gavin6942,"Less Satire, More Action Than The Original",7,17 October 2006,"A nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman, and other survivors of a worldwide plague that is producing aggressive, flesh-eating zombies, take refuge in a mega Milwaukee shopping mall. Production company Strike Entertainment (who had connections to distributor Universal) pulled out all the stops for this film. Being a fan of the original George A. Romero film, as we all are, I initially had my doubts about this one. As it turns out, however, by avoiding much of the original story, writer James Gunn helps the film avoid many of the comparisons it would have been subjected to. This is, for all practical purposes, a film of its own. And between my first viewing in 2004 and more recently in 2017, it has only grown in stature.Gunn's style of work with Troma (""Tromeo and Juliet"") and his later work with ""Slither"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" does not seem to arise much in this film. The humor is more subdued, but I will give him full credit for the Jay Leno / Burt Reynolds target practice scene. Excellent work. To be fair, Gunn actually left the project early to concentrate on ""Scooby-Doo 2"", Michael Tolkin (""The Rapture"") and Scott Frank (""Minority Report"") were brought in for rewriting; Tolkin further developed the characters, while Frank provided some of the bigger and upbeat action sequences. Interestingly, Gunn's ""Slither"" was the next project from producers Strike Entertainment.Zack Snyder makes his feature film directorial debut, though he had made music videos for Morrissey and Soul Asylum throughout the 1990s, so he was not a complete novice by any means. Interesting, Snyder was born in Green Bay, which may explain why the film is set in Milwaukee. Assisting him is cinematographer Matthew Leonetti, who started out on ""The Bat People"" (1974) but went on to great things with ""Poltergeist"", ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", ""Weird Science"" and many others.All of the acting in this is great, especially Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames, so there is no need to even get into that. Polley was Snyder's first choice, actually, which was wise on his part. Nobody stood out as the best, nobody fell short... by horror movies standards everything was kosher. The scenery was also great (it is a mall, it looked like a mall, job done). The zombies? Fantastic! So much better than the original in terms of getting the gore and missing limbs down to a science. Blood today is so much better than it used to be. What you may not know is that the special effects were done by Heather Langenkamp, better known to horror fans as Nancy from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise!There was some dispute between the producers and Snyder about putting Johnny Cash or Richard Cheese on the soundtrack, with Snyder ultimately prevailing. And I say unto thee, you could not have picked two better artists for the soundtrack. The Cash song (""The Man Comes Around"") set the necessary mood while the opening credits create the back story, and the Cheese song (""The Sickness"") kept the mood lighter when it needed to be (horror films really should not take themselves too seriously). Adding the original ""Sickness"" (by Disturbed) was a nice touch. In fact, the soundtrack as a whole really catapulted this film from good to great -- so we have to thank Snyder for that. I really enjoyed the news footage placed in the movie at the beginning and at later times, especially with Tom Savini (""we have a twitcher"") and Ken Foree (the televangelist). It really gave the movie a more ""real-life"" feel and was a good throwback to ""Night of the Living Dead"" with the radio reports, not to mention giving these ""Living Dead"" icons cameos.If you are holding back from watching this because you love the original, give it up. This film deserves a solid chance. If it helps, just ignore the fact the title is ""Dawn of the Dead"" -- this film rips off the original film much less than other films try to do. At least here, proper credit is given, but it really is a breed of its own.The 2017 Scream! Factory Blu-ray is phenomenal and the only home video version worth owning. Take your old DVDs and sell them. Scream! provides a two-disc set f both the theatrical version and the unrated one, both with new 2K scans. The features are packed in -- featurettes, storyboards, audio commentary, deleted scenes. New to this release is behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with several people, including horror royalty Heather Langenkamp and living legend James Gunn.",Dawn of the Dead
7,jboothmillard,Dawn of the Dead,6,31 January 2007,"I saw the original 1978 George A. Romero classic, and I knew that this remake was never going to beat it. It stuck to pretty much the same story as the original, where the characters go into a shopping mall and live as long as they can away from the flesh eating zombies, or living dead, and also, someone reuses the great tagline, ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth. What really grips you besides the sight of faster, pretty much more sophisticated zombies and gory effects, is the characters. These include nurse Ana (Sarah Polley), (my favourite) cop Kenneth (Pulp Fiction's great Ving Rhames), Michael (Medium's Jake Weber), Andre (Mekhi Phifer), Steve (Ty Burrell), CJ (Michael Kelly), Terry (Kevin Zegers), Bart (Michael Barry), Nicole (Lindy Booth), Norma (Jayne Eastwood) and mall neighbour Tucker (Boyd Banks). Moments of this were good, including a pregnant woman who dies, becomes a zombie, and then just after she dies the baby is born, also a zombie. Good!",Dawn of the Dead

9,BA_Harrison,This is how remakes SHOULD be made!,10,18 November 2007,"One of the few remakes of recent years that is actually worth watching, Zack Snyder's Dawn Of The Dead takes the basic plot from George Romero's 1978 original, in which survivors of a zombie outbreak barricade themselves in an abandoned mall, and strips away the social commentary whilst cranking up the action, delivering a white-knuckle ride of flesh-eating terror.A nerve-shredding pre-titles sequence see Ana (Sarah Polly), a pretty nurse, narrowly escaping with her life after her neighbourhood is rapidly over-run by the living dead: nasty, snarling, nightmarish creatures that, unlike in Romero's movie, can run like the clappers. All around her, chaos is erupting as the zombies rapidly increase in numbers, and Sarah eventually loses control of her car and crashes into a tree. Cut to black. Cue titles...I haven't seen such a great opening to a film since Raiders of the Lost Ark!And what follows is just as intense. The remainder of the film sees Sarah team up with a tough cop (Ving Rhames), a TV salesman (Jake Weber), and a young couple expecting their first child (Mekhi Phifer and Inna Korobkina), who are travelling to the relative safety of a nearby mall. But once in the sprawling shopping centre, the group realises that zombies are not the only threat to their safety: the white trash security guards that patrol the building are not too keen on sharing their sanctuary with outsiders.Very gory, and damn scary (a scene in a pitch black underground car-park being my favourite creepy moment), with characters that are developed enough for us to care about, Dawn Of The Dead is a triumph. Its narrative contains enough differences from the original to make it constantly surprising, the special effects are top notch, with truly unsettling zombies and some disgustingly realistic gore, and the cast are utterly convincing as the terrified survivors of a nightmarish apocalypse.I first saw this film at a late-night screening in my local multiplex. Afterwards, nerves extremely jangled, I had to walk through a nearby shopping centre in order to get to my car, which was parked in a large and quite poorly lit car-park.I'm not ashamed to say that I've never moved so fast in my life!",Dawn of the Dead
10,paul_haakonsen,A worthy re-make for once...,7,20 January 2016,"Normally I am not particularly keen on re-makes of movies, especially when directors decide to tamper with movies that were already good in the original version. But this being a zombie movie, is almost sufficient in itself to make me look past my contempt for re-makes. But as a re-make of the 1978 original Romero movie ""Dawn of the Dead"", I must admit that director Zack Snyder really impressed.While there are in overall similarities to the 1978 movie, then director Zack Snyder deviated enough from the original movie to make this 2004 version outstanding and memorable. And he managed to do so without actually embarrassing the George A. Romero legacy. And while there are similarities, then there is even more originality, which makes the 2004 version seem like a very different movie compared to the original.The story, briefly summarized, is about a group of people cramped together inside a shopping mall with hordes of relentless zombies gathering outside. But with chances of survival dwindling, tempers flare, and things taking unseen twists, the survivors struggle not just against the zombies, but also against themselves.The effects in Zack Snyder's version were impressive, with lots of great visuals in terms of zombie make-up, wounds and injuries and the special effects throughout the movie. And such effects are crucial when making a zombie movie, and I will say that the special effects and make-up departments really came through in this 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"".But a lot of credit should also go to the acting talents, as they had some talented people on the cast list. Sarah Polley was really great in her role, and I haven't really taken much notice of her prior to this movie. Ty Burrell, Ving Rhames and Jake Weber were also quite good in their individual roles. Personally, I found it a delight to see Matt Frewer in the movie as well.""Dawn of the Dead"" is a fast paced movie with lots of entertainment and thrills. Director Zack Snyder managed to present his vision in a way that was captivating and compelling for the audience, and it is difficult not to get swept up into the atmosphere of the movie.This 2004 version is well-worthy of a place in the movie collection of any zombie aficionado, and it is likewise well-worthy of a place alongside with Romero's 1978 version.",Dawn of the Dead
11,Quinoa1984,"A post-modernist's take on Romero's masterpiece- a good film, for what it's worth...",7,25 March 2004,"(SPOILER WARNING)I won't be a complete close-minded critic of the remake of the new Dawn of the Dead remake, but I do have to be critical about it, not just for my own piece of mind, but because I think the original happens to have a crucial place in horror, and indeed all of cinema, history.  When Romero created his film it was definitely original, or at least an original riff on what he had started a decade before.  It had laughs, but it didn't over-do it in cheesy-ness, and there was a constant sense of doom and satire when dealing with the apocalyptic climate of his slow-moving, blue-ish & pale zombies roaming the country-sides.Now we have Zack Snyder, working from a script by James Gunn, who has decided to take on Romero's view of society and sense of horror for 2004. As I left the theater I felt similar, coincidentally, to how I felt after I first watched Tom Savini's remake of 'Night' years ago - yes, the make-up and special effects are improved, yes there are some effective scares here and there, and yes, every once in a while there's a laugh at a zombie's expense.  But, and here's a question for horror fans, why should it have been titled Dawn of the Dead?  Yeah, it takes the concept of the survivors in the mall, and it has some bits of dialog lifted from Romero's script. However, there I would say draws the line for the similarities.  In a way, I felt like the filmmakers could've just ripped Romero's material off, given the film a different title, and I wouldn't of thought and felt the story and attack sequences were not entirely improvements on the original but, well, mutations.Because, as a zombie film in and of itself, set aside from the reality that it is a remake (this is for all you who didn't see the original yet and are thinking of seeing this one first), it's not a poorly made or deplorable work.  The acting is also dependable, especially by the likes of a strong lead in Rhames, an interesting female lead in Polley, a chilling supporting role in Phiefer, and plenty of well-balanced work turned in by character actors like Weber and Burrell.  As I said, the make-up is impressive (er, for it's Hollywood budget), and there's one scene involving a pregnant woman that did have me glued to my seat.But then there came the problems I had with the film, and it wasn't just that not enough time and patience was given to develop the characters more appropriately or give the story a certain juicy-ness Romero had pouring out of him.  Now, I don't think running zombies are a cause for total uproar - I thought it was highly effective in 28 Days Later, as prime example - yet I may not be the only one who thinks that there's something just slightly eerie and exact to how the living-dead moved in Romero's films as opposed to Snyder's.  There are the explanations I've heard from various zombie fanatics (many on this site) to explain it, but it's almost irrelevant to explain it for a genre such as this.  The living-dead exist entirely in the 'movie world', and since this film doesn't even bother to explain how the virus got started (the original didn't explain it either, but it didn't have to as it was a sequel to a film that did explain it in its sci-fi quality), saying one is more shocking than the other doesn't give much justice to how people will react person to person.  As for the other flaws, I thought the dog element was a little under-cooked (is dog too good for their tastes, huh?), a number of times the dialog felt forced, and also the very end left a bad taste in my mouth.  I won't say much about it, but the last scenes in this film remind me what separates such a remake from an original horror film from the 1970's - a minor lack of respect for audience intelligence and expectations.Maybe I've been sounding biased in parts of my review, that I should recognize that it's a revision, and it should be respected.  I do respect it, and it wasn't a disappointment.  As I left the theater though, I realized something that also came to me after I left the Texas Chain Saw Massacre remake (which was a huge mess any way to look at it), and also after seeing the remake of Cape Fear recently (a film of which I haven't seen the original yet, which I fear I may not like as much, though time will tell).  Some movies may be seen when we are young, and they may leave such an impression, especially after multiple viewings, that the first notion of a remake sounds ridiculous.  It's not to say that when a director has an idea of how they personally want to improve on a classic it's not warranted. But, with some films, it's often very challenging to be equalized let alone top them.  A number of films may improve on originals, giving the original director a taste of what new blood has to offer for the genre.  In dealing with Dawn of the Dead, I won't be a movie-snob and say that a remake should not have been attempted let alone executed.  It's not a failure - it's just not anything I'll pay to see again unless it's on cable.  Note of interest to fans, they're (for gag value I suppose) cameos with original stars like Ken Foree and Tom Savini, though for not much other purpose than to remind viewers it's a remake.  Oh well - (strong) B",Dawn of the Dead
12,wes-connors,Dead Again,7,22 July 2009,"Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" gets off to a shaky start by not improving upon the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" image of the innocent neighbor girl turned brain-eating zombie (1968's cellar dwelling Kyra Schon was the original). But, by the time nurse heroine Sarah Polley (as Ana) hits the road, all is forgiven. This film lives up to its DVD sleeve description: ""When a mysterious virus turns people into mindless, flesh-eating zombies, a handful of survivors wage a desperate, last-stand battle to stay alive and human! Exploding with terrifying surprises and nerve-shredding fun, 'Dawn of the Dead' is an edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride."" This one doesn't make the same subtle points as the earlier ""Dead"" films (real or imagined), it's predictable, and it tailspins in a dumb ending.

13,Coventry,When there's no more room in hell...the zombie fun moves to earth!,8,5 July 2004,"Now, THIS is a remake worth watching! Director Zack Snyder proves here that nowadays remakes don't necessarily have to be uninspired, overbudgetted productions meant only to make money at the expense of the original films. George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead was awfully close to being perfectAnd Snyder seems to realize this too! He didn't try to add (or change) anything to the substance of the film, but merely focuses on disgusting and amusing the audience. Respectively with filthy prosthetic make-up effects and some of the blackest humor you'll ever see. Without any explanation or logical cause, the dead are raised overnight. The reanimated corpses attack the living and once you're infectedyou become a zombie as well (notice that this word isn't used once in the movie, though). A group of survivors gather in the local mall and watch the place getting surrounded by an endless army of the bloodthirsty undead. At first, the remaining hillbillies keep themselves entertained by playing wicked games (shoot that Jay Leno look-alike!!) but soon the situation becomes more and more cul-de-sac and the growing internal intrigues result in dramatic, needless bloodshed.The atmosphere in Dawn of the Dead is light-headed, but Zack Snyder never really loses that brilliant apocalyptic touch. The feeling of hopelessness is upheld constantly and even wonderfully stressed by Johnny Cash' great song 'When the man comes around'. The film is filled with great references towards Romero's original, with the appearances of the original cast members as an absolute highlight. Initial zombie warriors Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger and Tom Savini all star briefly in this new version of Dawn. The main actors are worth praising as well. Ving Rhames was a great casting choice and the beautiful Sarah Polley impresses as the female lead. Snyder's style of film-making is loud and volatile, but it never becomes too irritant or boisterous. You can see his roots lie in shooting ads and commercials but he's obviously talented and capable of doing more. A comment I've heard a few times already is that this remake outshines the original. Of course it does NOT! Frankly, if you share this opinion you haven't got the slightest idea what the original stands for as a horror film. But it is terrific entertainment, for sure. I saw Dawn twice in the cinema already and I can't wait to buy it on DVD. Highly recommended horror fun!",Dawn of the Dead

15,hitchcockthelegend,"Come on, man. You must've heard the priest say something about life and death.",8,21 October 2015,"George Romero fans feared the worst, another one of his sacred original zombie trilogy films was being remade, this even though the remake of Night of the Living Dead didn't disgrace itself. As it happened, the fears were unfounded, for Zack Snyder and his team crafted one of the best horror remakes going.The premise follows Romero's wonderful version, a mysterious epidemic is causing the populace to turn into undead zombies, the bite of which transfers the illness to another. A small group of survivors make it to the Crossroads Mall and hole up there whilst trying to keep at bay the zombie hordes, but inner fighting threatens the group whilst they know they can't stay there for ever.Right from the off the film grabs you around the throat, it's a blistering and terrifying opening which brings heartbreak and terror in equal measure. It also announces to us that these zombies are different to Romero's, these suckers can run, and run fast. After some chaos and blood, the introductions to our survivors is set up and the pic settles into a superb group dynamic situation, where machismo and brains meet dumb and dumber, all while little devilish moments trickle away in the background.It's the focus on the survivors that really lifts it to greater heights, how they variously react to their plight, there's good thought gone into the screenplay (James Gunn). The natural progression of this type of film calls for horror moments, and Snyder deftly slots them in when the pic needs them, which again brings about scenes of terror and genuine heartbreaking moments. Some neat cameos will be cheered by fans of Romero's work, while the cast are superb here, with Sarah Polley the standout fulfilling the believable promise of the character as written.A remake that is its own beast yet still pays homage to what inspired it, and good at both! Now that's a rare thing in horror! 8/10",Dawn of the Dead
16,Theo Robertson,Blame Hollywood,4,8 February 2008,"Let's get something out of the way first and that is as a director George A Romero is way down there with Ed Wood . The technical aspects like editing and sound are awful while his cast are so wooden you'll get splinters from picking up a DVD of one of his films .But as both a producer and screenwriter he credits his audience with great respect and his films are unusually sophisticated and intelligent with DAWN OF THE DEAD being his masterwork . It's a film that pre-dates gore fests from the 1980s while at the same time mirroring the haunting novels of 1950s British apocalypse writers like John Wyndham and John Christopher and this level of sophistication I remember the original film for .It's difficult to know who to blame for this farce entitled DAWN OF THE DEAD . Romero doesn't have a producer credit and it shows . Zack Snyder later went on to direct 300 , one of the most aesthetically pleasing and remarkable films of recent years . But there's little here that is pleasing . A lot people have suggested 28 DAYS LATER rips off Romero but I wonder what these critics will say when they realise the zombies in this film are able to run like an Olympic runner ? Something along the lines of "" Well it was filmed in Canada so as a tribute to the Canadians they're a homage to Ben Johnson hence their rapid running ability "" . Don't patronise me because the zombies here are a homage to Danny Boyle rather than Romero Unfortunately Hollywood being Hollywood everything is about money so it's not difficult to see the motives behind remaking this horror classic . The technical term for this is "" Making a fast buck "" , also known as "" Making a bad film but it doesn't really matter because schmucks will buy their tickets before word of mouth causes the movie to disappear from the box office "" , so don't blame Canada - blame Hollywood",Dawn of the Dead

Then again, it couldn't be as good.  The original was a ground-breaker--it was the first unrated horror film to play in first-run theatres.  Also, for 1979, the amount of gore was just staggering.  Nobody had ever seen anything like this!  Also it wasn't just a horror film--it was also a satire on American consumerism.This one totally drops the satire (not a bad idea) and just goes full speed ahead with action, adventure and gore.  It's not as gory as the original, but it definetely pushes the level for an R-rated film.  DO NOT see this if you're squeamish.The acting is just so-so--even the great Sarah Polley seems muted!  But really--who sees this for the acting?  It's scary, fast and violent and also the dead, this time around, move MUCH quicker (and are often filmed running in fast motion which is truly scary).  It does have its slow moments but those are few.  And I REALLY hated the ending.Still, well worth seeing for horror fans.",Dawn of the Dead
18,poolandrews,"In my opinion not as good as the '78 original, nowhere near.",6,29 January 2007,"Dawn of the Dead starts just like any other ordinary day for nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) as she goes home after another long shift, she & her husband Luis (Justin Louis) go to bed & have a good nights sleep. The next morning Luis is woken by Vivian (Hannah Lochner), their next door neighbours young girl, who proceeds to bite Luis on the neck. Ana manages to push Vivian out of the room & locks the door, Luis dies in front of her but suddenly comes back to life & attacks Ana in the same frenzied way Vivian attacked him. Ana climbs out of the bathroom window & sees complete pandemonium outside as the dead are returning to life & attacking the living, Ana gets into her car & speeds off but ends up crashing. She is found by a cop named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) who in turn find a guy named Michael (Jake Weber) along with Andre (Mekhi Phifer) & his pregnant wife Luda (Inna Korobkina) who all decide to head to the local shopping mall to find safety. They break in & watch in horror as the streets outside become overrun by flesh eating zombies while the TV news broadcasts offer little hope, if any...Directed by first timer Zack Snyder Dawn of the Dead was apparently described as a 'reimagining' of George A. Romero's utterly brilliant Dawn of the Dead (1978) which itself was a sequel to his groundbreaking Night of the Living Dead (1968) which already has already been remade so I guess Dawn of the Dead was next in line & I personally think the result is less than inspiring. There are two versions available, the theatrical cut & a longer director's cut, unfortunately I watched the shorter theatrical version because that's the one they showed on TV even though I have the director's cut on DVD but just hadn't got round to watching it before it aired on TV, I wish I had because I don't really feel like watching it again despite the promise of some extra gore but I suppose that's irrelevant... The script by James Gunn is actually quite different from the original except the title & the fact that some of it is set in a shopping mall, I think that almost everything that made the '78 original so brilliant is lost or diluted here. The start of the film is completely different & in my opinion the best part of this 'reimagining' as it's rather effective & well built up, once the film gets to the mall not that much actually happens to be honest as straight away it's empty with only two zombies inside, there's no running around shooting zombies, there's no hiding out, there's no locking or blocking the doors off, there's no raid by the bikers & it all seems rather stale, static & predictable. Then there's the character's, there's just too many of them & there's no real connection between them unlike the original which had a tight group of four close friends this time around they are a bunch of unlikeable underdeveloped clichés like the self serving yuppie, the 'strong' female, the big cop, the middle class hero & the antagonistic redneck. I was also disappointed with the lack of social satire, unlike Romero's original which had meaning this is a shallow film where the mall is used as a place to hide & nothing more. When Dawn of the Dead '04 does do something different like the zombie baby or the fact the zombies actually run it goes nowhere & they seem like afterthoughts just for the hell of it. Having said that Dawn of the Dead '04 is far from a bad film, it moves along at nice pace, it has some decent if unspectacular set-pieces & action scenes, I must admit I really liked the ending with the video taped footage during the closing credits, it's very sleek & it certainly passes 100 odd minutes entertainingly enough but it had an almost impossible task to better the original which it most definitely doesn't in any way.Director Snyder does OK & there's plenty of homages to the original including cameo's from Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger & the ever watchable Tom Savini along with the BP trucks from the original turning up as does the WGON traffic helicopter also from the original. Gore wise I thought Dawn of the Dead '04 was very disappointing, there's no big gore scenes unlike the original, there's nothing in here to rival the screwdriver in the ear or the zombie having the top of his head sliced off by helicopter blades or zombies having machetes shoved into their faces or the gruesome cannibalistic scenes at the end. All this new version has to offer are better looking zombies, some gunshot wounds to the head, a spike through a zombies head, a poker through a zombies eye & after that I'm actually struggling, there's nothing here that memorable that will have people talking unlike Dawn of the Dead '78.With a supposed budget of about $28,000,000 Dawn of the Dead '04 obviously is better made than the original with that big budget Hollywood polish about it, it's well made & has good special effects. Apparently the budget for Dawn of the Dead '04 was 'significantly slashed' by Universal after the critical & commercial failure of House of the Dead (2003). The acting is forgettable, I must admit I disliked most of the character's in this.Dawn of the Dead is a perfectly watchable & entertaining horror film that is certainly worth a watch but I think it pales into insignificance when compared to Dawn of the Dead '78, it seems to have a good reputation but it just didn't for much for me. However if you like shallow story lines, poor character's & no stand out set-pieces then you too might like it. Good but not brilliant & overall pretty disappointing.",Dawn of the Dead
19,dbborroughs,Not Your Mother's Zombie Film,8,20 March 2004,"To compare the two Dawn of the Dead films is unfair. Twenty five years have passed and there is no doubt that what passes for a R rated film today would have been X rated when the original came out (and vice versa). The two films also have very little in common other than the  basic premise.Where the original film had more than being scary on its mind this new film is more concerned with building tension. The zombies, instead of being slow moving beasts of the original, move with the speed of a track star, so there really is a reason to fear them, you either kill them or they will kill you giving you no time to run. This will either thrill you or make you scream in pain. Personally I think it works since it explains why things fall apart so fast.The new film, like the old film, is not with out its flaws, they just occur in different places.If you want to see a really good horror/action film that takes its source material and does something other tan resting on its laurels with it, see this movie. However, be warned it is as bloody as the first in its own way.8 out of 10 (which is what I'd give the original)",Dawn of the Dead
20,lastliberal,I am not a horror fan,8,10 March 2007,"I don't usually watch horror films. I have maybe seen three or four. I'm not talking about old Dracula or Frankenstein movies, but the current stuff. This film was so good that even a non fan like myself would enjoy it.The film was tense and action packed throughout. If you like blood, this film had it, but it wasn't gross. If you like tight suspense, then this is the film for you. It changed every second and you never knew where it would end. I'm still not sure about the ending, but I am not hopeful for the four who were left.Ving Rhames was excellent. He was supported by a great cast and each character added something of value to the film.",Dawn of the Dead
21,zardoz-13,"Snyder's 100-minute remake equals the imaginative, but bloated 126-minute original and surpasses it in several respects",9,22 June 2007,"Although Zack Snyder has produced only a handful of television commercials for Chevy Blazer, Budweiser, the NFL Quarterback Club, and BMW, this first-time helmer makes a stunning directorial debut with his super-charged, high-octane, blood-drenched remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" (***1/2 out of ****), zombie-master George Romero's low-budget, classic cannibal chiller sequel to his 1968 seminal undead black & white opus ""Night of the Living Dead."" Hard as it may be to imagine, Snyder's 100-minute remake equals the imaginative, but bloated 126-minute original and surpasses it in several respects. Naturally, Snyder benefits from conspicuous computer-generated special effects (not available to Romeo in 1978), a $28-million budget, and a fabulous cast featuring Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, Mekhi Phifer, and Jake Weber. The only blunder in scenarist James Gunn's screenplay is the irrational sentimentality one character attaches to a canine. Can anybody forget the scene in ""Alien"" when Sigourney Weaver put herself in peril to rescue that darn cat? Well, pretty much the same thing occurs here smack in the middle of an adrenaline-laced action scene, and you want to shout back at the screen to stop such stupidity. Such is the visceral power of this entertaining but ghoulish ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake. Compared with the shuffle-footed zombies of Romero's trilogy, Snyder's zombies rush their victims headlong like the defensive line of the Green Bay Packers on first and goal. Despite this unfortunate animal-lover's cliché, Snyder and Gunn have churned out one of the more riveting zombie movies in years. Forget those recent, reanimated efforts in the same direction by Paul Anderson's ""Resident Evil"" and Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later."" Unlike its prestigious, path-breaking predecessor, who belongs to the independent, non-Hollywood film category, Snyder's mainstream Tinseltown remake fondly cherishes many of Romero's ideas when it isn't taking a different track. A group of unglamorous but heroic characters and Matthew F. Leonetti's grainy, stark widescreen photography give this macabre but mindless melodrama a hypnotic, hair-raising presence punctuated with bouts of satire.Whereas the original ""Dawn"" opened with a S.W.A.T team blowing zombies away before the heroes flew away in a helicopter to the comparative safety of a Pennsylvania shopping mall, the hyperactive remake takes place in a Wisconsin mall. As the story unfolds, an overworked nurse, Ana (Sarah Polley of ""Go""), gets off work and heads home to her hubby for sex in the shower. During her hospital shift, she saw and heard about patients with mysterious bite wounds, but she missed all the special bulletins about a developing epidemic where these people die and come back to life as zombies. No, these aren't the traditional voodoo zombies from movies like ""White Zombie"" (1932) or ""Plague of the Zombies"" (1966). Instead, these undead dudes arise from an inexplicable virus or disease. In Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead,"" newscasters speculated that a contaminated satellite probe back from space resurrected the dead. Nobody knows for sure in this ""Dawn"" remake, and when Ana and her husband awaken the following morning to find her preteen daughter standing in their doorway with blood stains on her nightie, part of her face eaten away and a powerful urge to gnaw human flesh. She attacks her dad, tears a hole in his throat, and blood flies everywhere. A terrified Ana tries to stem the fountain of blood. Suddenly, her husband's eyes take on a dull glow and he goes after her. She escapes, jumps into her car, and careens off into the dawn. Chaos rules everywhere. Explosions erupt; smoke billows in clouds, and berserk gore-smeared corpses chomp away at anybody. Eventually, Ana hooks up with a police sergeant, Kenneth (Ving Rhames of ""Pulp Fiction), a husband, Andre (Mekhi Phifer of ""Honey""), his wife Luda (Inna Korobkina of ""The Ladies Man"") and a salesman Michael (Jake Webber of ""Meet Joe Black"") and they take refuge in the Crossroads Mall. Initially, they run afoul of three trigger-happy security guards: CJ (Michael Kelly of ""Unbreakable""), Terry (Kevin Zegers of ""Wrong Turn""), and Bart (Michael Barry of ""Detroit Rock City ""). Predictably, these guys aren't happy to see them. They form an uneasy alliance and resolve their differences when thousands of zombies besiege them in the mall. No, a biker gang doesn't show up as in the original ""Dawn."" Instead, a truckload of other refugees shows up. Before the TV stations sign off, a preacher (Ken Foree of the original ""Dawn"") utters the line made famous in Romero's ""Dawn"": ""When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth."" Unlike the original,too, the remake gives our heroes another, more interesting way out of their predicament that recalls the climax in the Clint Eastwood epic ""The Gauntlet.""Shrewdly, Zack Snyder alternates scares with satire. Like the original, the heroes speculate that the zombies are flocking to the mall because it played a dominant role in their lives. Alas, this clever concept made the original ""Dawn"" a witty satire on the foibles of humanity. Synder's ""Dawn"" doesn't capitalize on it as much as Romeo's ""Dawn."" Instead, Snyder focuses on the alliance the occupants make before they break out and make a run for it. One scene that stands out involves the husband and wife. She gets bitten, but her husband hides her from the others. She turns into a hideous zombie and gives birth to a zombie baby. Mind you, if you like to dream sweet dreams, watching this ""Dawn"" is going to be a nightmare for you. There's blood, gore, and more, but none of these zombies feast on body parts with the oozing alacrity that Romeo's zombies did. While Romeo generated suspense in his version, Snyder gives us wall-to-wall suspense that will have you gnawing your fingers to the quick. Make-up artist Tom Savini, who handled the blood and gore in the original ""Dawn,"" has a cameo as a sheriff. Watching Zach Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is like taking a bullet in the head.",Dawn of the Dead
22,Boba_Fett1138,Gore fest.,9,3 August 2005,"With all those bad horror remakes coming out lately this movie feels like a breath of fresh air. It's original but still remains faithful to enough to the original material.The movie beginnings very promising and features some of the better opening credits I have seen in a while. After the quite hectic and realistic opening the movie doesn't loose much of its power. It remains tense and till some extend realistic throughout the entire movie.The fun feeling of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" movie is at times also still present but this movie is more tense and gory than entertaining really. The zombies are real killing machines this time and can actually run this time. This provides more than enough tense moments. For the fans of gore there is more than enough to enjoy here, also make sure to pick up the unrated director's cut for even more gore and explicit scenes.Only problem is that the movie features a bit too many characters. The movie would had been better of if it had just focused on the first small group of character, formed in the beginning of the movie. Because of the many characters we lose track at times and don't ever get emotionally involved with any of the characters. Bit seriously, that is my only complaint about this fantastic gore filled horror movie.Also want to know what happened to our heroes after their escape? Keep watching till the end credits.Especially recommendable for the fans of gore and horror but also perfectly watchable for those who aren't familiar with the original George A. Romero zombie movies or horror in general.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Dawn of the Dead
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Largely a popcorn flick, but one of the better ones",8,13 October 2009,"I base this upon the Director's Cut. However, I saw this at the theater, as well. There are new story sequences(among other things, making CJ likable), and the movie also gets bloodier. This remake of the 1978 classic that it shares a title with has the zombies running(I think which appears more comical is a matter of taste), and takes a stylized approach(note that it is not as indulgent as what Zach did on 300 and Watchmen, I believe he reserves that for graphic novel adaptations), without the form overshadowing the content. Apart from a marvelous look and awesome action(there are those that would say that it overshadows the horror; just don't forget, this has plenty of creepiness, jump scares that pay off, unforgettable disturbing content and bone-chilling atmosphere, also it adds stuff that, if it has been seen before in the sub-genre, it's certainly been a long time since it was), this actually does engage the viewer, and at least for the 100 minute running time, you care about these people, though you'll definitely find some to hate(and this does use a couple of clichés). Snyder is no Romero, but to be fair, he really isn't trying to be. He's got his own voice, and it's nicely distinctive without attracting too much attention to itself. This goes for comedy to a greater extent than the 'real' ""Dead"" films, and typically succeeds. There is a little satire, and it's spot-on, perfectly delivered. The acting is mixed. There are a couple of impeccable performances. The pace is even, and mostly quite fast. This never loses your interest, and, for the right audience, it is a satisfying viewing experience. There is graphic and brutal gore, brief nudity, a moderate amount of strong language, and of course what I've already mentioned. The DVD comes with an introduction to the version, five deleted scenes, three featurettes(one of them, along with Andy's Lost Tape, have separate pages here on the site, and I will comment on them there), and a cringe-inducingly corny and overlong production called Special Report. I recommend this to any fan of this type of cinema. 8/10",Dawn of the Dead
24,view_and_review,A zombie movie taking place during the day???,6,21 February 2007,"This is the type of movie I usually try to avoid: the walking dead, buckets of blood, dire hopelessness, etc. Not only do these types of movies creep me out, they disgust me. Having said all that, this came on one of the movie channels and I had nothing better to do than watch it. Boy this movie didn't waste any time with the zombies. I think it was the second or third scene that the little girl wakes up and decides that she wants to eat mommy and daddy.Eventually a group of living were able to hole themselves up in a mall, which I thought was interesting and smart. So few people are smart in horror films thereby lending themselves to be easy prey. Now, of course there had to be at least one act of stupidity or this would not have been a true horror, and there was one. The mall scenes were more or less an attempt to buy time to come up with an escape plan. Well, they escaped... sort of.This movie was probably the best of its kind that I've ever seen, not that that's saying much. I sat through it and watched from beginning to end, so I had to give it an above average rating.",Dawn of the Dead
25,Uriah43,Better in Some Ways Than Its Famous Predecessor,8,26 July 2014,"Although this movie is a remake it has a few differences that make it better in some ways than its famous predecessor which goes by the same name. For starters, this movie was filmed 26 years later and it obviously has better technology at its disposal. Additionally, the first movie depended almost exclusively upon the horror aspect showcasing slow-moving zombies and relying heavily upon the gore factor. It also seemed to place a greater emphasis on character development which tended to give the audience a greater feel for the characters. This movie has fast zombies which results in plenty of action sequences. That said, viewers who enjoy an action movie will probably like this film over the older version. On the other hand, those who prefer a bit more shock and gore will almost certainly prefer the original movie. Be that as it may, I thought Ving Rhames (as the policeman named ""Kenneth"") was tailor-made for this role and he performed it very well. I also liked the performances of Sarah Polley (""Ana"") and Jake Weber (""Michael""). Along with that, I thought that Kim Poirier (""Monica"") was absolutely gorgeous and wished that she had been given a larger role. In any case, the original movie was extremely good and even though there were some elements in it which may have been better, this remake had some improvements which I believe tended to balance things out. As a result, I rate this movie the same as I rated the original ""Dawn of the Dead"". If you like zombie movies then I think you should check this one out.",Dawn of the Dead

Frankly, as a remake this one here succeeds quite nicely with some rather gruesome-looking zombie make-up and gore-gags, fantastic action scenes that are utterly thrilling which include the final escape attempt from the mall inside the barricaded truck while trying to fend off the unreal swarms around them, numerous quality thwarted escape attempts inside the parking garage and a few funny gags spread throughout when dealing with the zombie horde outside, not to mention the utterly thrilling and breath-taking opening set-up that still manages to shock and entertain at the same time. There's still some problems here, from unrealistic character stupidity to throw themselves into danger, a complete lack of common knowledge or intelligence displayed, a dearth of zombie action in the middle for useless moments to pile up as they live their lives, and then comes the running zombie debacle that really permeates this one and moreover is the key to getting through to this one, as such a massive flaw against the main characters themselves is enough to knock this one down enough for some to despise it, as well as its standing as a remake in the first place. It's still got enough to entertain, but there's some flaws to be found.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a short sex scene, and animals in peril.",Dawn of the Dead
27,FlashCallahan,The dead will walk the mall....,7,27 February 2017,"Ana goes home to her husband, after a difficult night shift, but is shocked in the morning when he is brutally attacked by her neighbour. In the chaos of her neighbourhood, Ana flees and comes into contact with a police officer named Kenneth, along with more survivors who decide that their best chances of survival would be found in the deserted Crossroads Shopping Mall. When supplies begin to run low and other trapped survivors need help, the group come to realise that they cannot stay there forever, and plan to escape......To say now that Snyder made a film that would stand proud in the serious Zombie horror genre, would be met with guffaws, seeing that since this film, his output has been mediocre to say the least. But in 2004, one film changed the way people would perceive the 'Zombie' genre, and the way most 'zombie' films are made today.But that's enough of Shaun Of The Dead.DOTD doesn't try anything new, aside from the fast zombies that we would all hate to be stuck with, and although it never reaches the height's of the original, it still entertaining and shocking in equal doses, thanks to a wonderful script, and very good performances from all the cast.There is nothing special about this group of people, and they wood be just as nameless as the dead outside, if you were to pass them on a normal day.The film does follow the tropes you would expect from a film like this. You get the leader of the pack, who is just a simple mane with common sense, the people who were there first, thinking they are the kings of the castle. The obligatory yuppie, who whines throughout the movie, until he comes good. We get the tough cop with a heart of gold, and of course, because we have to be all PC, the main protagonist is a woman, who adapts to everything really, really quickly (see also The River Wild).It never lets up, there are some truly disturbing scenes, but foe a remake of one of the most cherished zombie films of all times, it's a pretty solid film.",Dawn of the Dead
28,Aaron1375,I liked it as much as the original.,9,21 March 2004,"I did like this movie as much as the original, though for different reasons. This one starts out showing you the outbreak as it first happens and I thought that was very nicely done.  Sure ""Night of the Living Dead"" sort of showed us the initial outbreak, but this one does it in such a fast and furious way.  This movie has a few similarities with the original, though not many.  Mainly the name and the fact the survivors find refuge in a mall are the main similarities.  This is fine by me because I do not want to watch the same movie again.  The zombies here are fast, sort of like the zombies in ""Return of the Living Dead"" or ""Nightmare City"", but they are still stupid and can be killed with a bullet to the brain.  They are also a lot better than the ones in ""28 Days Later"" though they were not really zombies.  They were just people infected with a disease that turned violent and puked blood, while the zombies here do what zombies normally do...eat people.  Some humorous moments are scattered throughout, as are a few cameos...Tom Savini and Ken Foree are the two I noticed.  Good action and lots of zombies to be seen here.  This movie does one of the better jobs of making you believe the zombies are everywhere and the zombies are numerous. All in all good zombie action fun to be had.",Dawn of the Dead
29,Wuchakk,Horrifying and INTENSE,8,12 March 2014,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is the 2004 remake of the original 1978 classic horror film.THE STORY: When dead people start coming back to life it seems like the end of the world. A group of people (led by Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jack Weber and Michael Kelly) hold up in a shopping mall to survive while the dead increasingly congregate outside. What's going on? What can they do? How can they survive? And is there any hope? Although the basic plot is the same as George Romero's original film the characters and storyline are completely different; hence, this is more of a re-envisioning rather than a true remake. Personally I prefer it this way. We already have the original so let's see a different take. No? I just saw this film last night and it was so freakin' horrifying and INTENSE I couldn't sleep for two hours. This, for me, reveals the true effectiveness of a horror flick -- whether or not you can sleep afterwards. In this sense ""Dawn"" is a 5/5 Star film all the way.What I liked about the story is that it takes the material seriously; there's no, goofy, campy, unrealistic vibe. What would it be like if dead people REALLY started coming back to life and seeking out living flesh to eat? This is the approach the filmmakers take here.One reviewer complained that it was unrealistic that the characters on occasion would laugh, smile and joke around during such a dire, hopeless situation. But this isn't unbelievable at all. It's a natural defensive mechanism of the human psyche to try to have fun, joke and make the most out of a bad situation. I've seen it numerous times in my life and the lives of others over the years (car accident, hospitalization, destruction of property, serious illness, death, etc.). Besides, the film more than adequately portrays the downside of human reaction -- depression, violence, grief, madness, etc.The only negative I can cite is the speeding-up effect used in the Third Act. It worked at times but too often it came across as awkward or amateurish and just served to confuse the viewing experience.Some people didn't like the zombie birth scene but I found it well-done and effective.The original was filmed at the Monroeville Mall near Pittsburgh, PA, while this remake was shot at the (now demolished) Thornhill Square Mall in Ontario, although the story takes place in Milwaukee.The theatrical version runs 101 minutes (the version I saw) and the Director's Cut 110 minutes.BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a truly intense, horrifying flick you can't go wrong with this 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead.""GRADE: A-",Dawn of the Dead
30,mm-39,Fast paced,9,10 April 2004,"Spoiler  This film is well paced.  My wife likes the original better, but my opinion differs from hers.  I, personally, find that over the years, directing, film quality, acting, editing, and special effects have improved.  I see this improvement with this film.  The film makers made the story different enough from the original, that the view is not watching a repeat.  It starts out well, with the nurse and others finding a strange infection, no one knows how it starts, the nurse and husband should have been paying attention to the TV.  Morning comes and this is the best part of the film, anarchy happens, like how I believe events would really happen, ie. the van hitting the car.  This movie shows how attitudes have changed over the years, with lots of the characters having jerkitist,  I find this very realistic, this jerkitist plague we have today is spreading fast like the zombies.  This fits into the story, I am surprised no one has picked up on the story's social message.  This zombie plague is brought on my humanity as a punishment, the evil that we do.  When the minister said when hell is full the dead will walk the earth.  This means the Zombies are the damned, humanity was so bad they filled up hell and had no other place to go but with the living.  They are suffering on earth, and prey on the living out of rage.  That is why they do not care about the dog in the movie.  That is why going to an island or under water or anywhere doesn't matter; the damned will just walk across the lake they can't die, just their body does.  The film shows how no one cares and causes this effect, except for a few.  In the end, humanity was damned this is how I interpret this film.  What caused it is for your own mind to make up. 9 out of 10  Mike",Dawn of the Dead
31,Mr-Fusion,Hyper-violent action movie with zombies,5,11 July 2011,"George Romero's '78 classic ""Dawn of the Dead"" gets a cosmetic facelift in this über-gory remake from newcomer Zack Snyder. I will say this: it's a terrific movie if you've never seen the original. Snyder put together a pretty good zombie movie. But it's clear that he (and screenwriter James Gunn) wanted no part of the satirical humor of the original. Snyder just set out to make a kickass zombie movie, while at the same time upping the ante. And in some respects, he succeeded.The action this time around takes place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The pandemic (like the original) springs from out of nowhere, taking the country by surprise. A group of survivors bands together and seeks refuge in an abandoned shopping mall while they formulate an escape plan. All the while, zombie hordes gather on the outside of the mall, looking for a way in.The most noticeable change is in the zombies, themselves. No longer do they shuffle around like geriatrics. Snyder turns it up a notch with running, leaping and screaming. His zombies are indeed much more of a threat (not to mention terrifying). But the makeup here (compared with Romero's original) is on a whole different level. The pallid complexions of 1978 give way to bloody, decaying pieces of meat (nothing like a zombie with half a mouth!).What's interesting about Snyder's version is that it's almost more action movie than horror. Here, running and gun-play are just as important as blood-spatter and severed limbs. It makes for a lean, mean zombie flick, and in that regard, I think it works. I tend to wonder if the powers-that-be should've just concentrated on upping-the-ante with the zombie movie, but not even associate it with ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), which is why I was ultimately disappointed. It's as if Snyder & Co. made this movie because they found the original ""too boring"", and felt it needed to be faster, bloodier, etc. Lost in that update is the sense of fun inherent in the original. The remake also eschews the social commentary of the zombies being attracted to a shopping mall (mindless consumers), in favor of the shopping mall just being a place to convene in relative safety. In that respect, it seems rather arbitrary to set the movie in a shopping mall in the first place.It's clear they used the same title for brand-recognition, but it should've been its own thing; Snyder's throwing down the gauntlet with his own movie, not a remake.5/10",Dawn of the Dead

33,christopher-underwood,Not terrible but terribly disappointing.,6,9 January 2021,"The opening of this, the pre-title sequence, is breathtaking. The couple and their child in the suburban house, the fast moving terror and gore and out on the street the full and terrifying picture becoming apparent is awe inspiring and I felt like rising up and applauding. And then we proceed to the mall and although it is interesting at first to notice the difference between the 70s and 00s malls, between Romero's setting and this, it is sadly all downhill from here. We miss the joy of looting, we miss the bonding of characters, we miss the knowledge in the back of our minds that there is a helicopter way out and we miss the bikers and just about everything that is good about the Romero and Argento originals. We are way ahead in this one, we groan as soon as we see the pregnant woman, we can't wait for the repercussions to be out the way and we begin to long for those zombies to get in and chomp them up. Having the dead move so quickly must have seemed a brave and innovative move but it ruins everything and although could presumably have been made to work in a different environment, not in a closed one like this, that relied on that spooky, jerky, slow but persistent and relentless forward thrust.

I need to rent it again and see what the original was. I thought this remake was very excellent. It wasn't all like computer effects, mostly make up. There a few flaws. Like I wished they explained a little more on the virus. And the ending seemed a little strange. I'm kind of curious if they will make another ""Dawn of the Dead"".

36,sddavis63,A Surprisingly Good Zombie Movie!,8,4 September 2011,"Back in 1968, ""Night of the Living Dead"" did a really good job with the whole concept of zombies, and of those who weren't zombies being trapped in a hopeless situation as they struggled to find a way to survive. Somehow after that, though, the whole ""zombie"" craze seemed to lose its footing. Any such movies I've happened upon have really been rather silly with nothing much to be taken seriously and nothing much to commend them. Then I happened upon ""Dawn of the Dead."" This movie manages to get the whole zombie thing right, and the end result is a movie that works really well from start to finish.There's no science in this; nobody spends much time trying to explain what's happening. The closest might be Ana (played by Sarah Polley) finally figuring out that the zombie ""infection"" is caused by a bite - although that was a bit anti-climactic. I mean, wasn't it rather obvious? But there's no time wasted offering much in the way of explanation. This is just happening. There are living dead everywhere seeking to bite and kill others, who will then turn into zombies themselves. In keeping with the simplicity, the movie jumps right into the mystery. After a brief opening scene in which Ana (a nurse) puzzles as her shift ends about why a man who was hurt in a fight would end up in the ICU, we go right into the action, and the opening zombie attacks (without giving too much away) are both shocking and terrifying. Ana ends up bound together with a group of survivors who hole up in a local shopping mall while they try to figure out how they're going to get out of this mess.This is very frightening at times, and - be warned if this bothers you - it's very, very bloody. The sense of hopelessness is real, and although the ultimate fate of the survivors we've been following isn't really made clear, there's no sense left by the end of the movie that theirs will be a happy ending. Give credit to those who put this together. It's an excellent movie, although I confess that I personally didn't really see the humour in using background music like ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" and ""You Light Up My Life."" It was meant to have a degree of irony, I guess, given the situation. I just found it out of place. Still, a very good movie with a lot of chills and a pretty decent cast. (8/10)",Dawn of the Dead
37,Buddy-51,pretty good though not up to the original,7,12 March 2005,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is a remake of the George Romero film from 1978, which was itself a sequel to his 1968 classic, ""Night of the Living Dead."" This new version, written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder, follows the original storyline fairly closely, centering on a group of people who are holed up in a local shopping mall while flesh-eating zombies wreak havoc on the world outside.The original, in addition to being a horror film, was also a playful little satire on the consumerism in modern society. This version shucks this dimension entirely in favor of a straight-ahead horror approach. It may seem impossible for someone to actually ""dumb down"" a horror film, but Gunn and Snyder have managed to do that here. For this reason, the most famous and imaginative images from the first film - that of the undead wandering through the mall, vacantly interacting with the clothing and other paraphernalia contained therein, just as they did in their previous lives - are nowhere to be found in this edition. The other major difference between this and the original is that the zombies themselves are no longer restricted to a lumbering pace but can actually outrun the people they are pursuing. Although, theoretically, this should increase their terror potential, it actually winds up diminishing it somewhat because it robs them of that otherworldly creepiness that made them so scary in the earlier movie.Nevertheless, this remake turns out to be a fairly effective cannibal zombie movie even if it doesn't rise to the level of the original. There's a nice apocalyptic feel to much of the earlier portions of the film, and the screenplay allows for a reasonable bit of character development within the rather limited framework of the genre. There's even a very subtle homage to the great ""Carnival of Souls,"" the far more gentle precursor to all these over-the-top zombie pictures, when a character describes himself as a church organist who sees his ""calling"" as ""just a job."" Although the film isn't really all that scary, ""Dawn of the Dead"" provides just enough tension and chills to make it worth seeing for any true horror film aficionado.",Dawn of the Dead
38,thesar-2,Hell's Full. Get Ready.,8,25 October 2009,"Horror goes in cycles, and as all circles, you always end up where you started. At times, they bombard us with Zombies, then Psychos, then demons, then haunted houses/spirits, etc and back. A few years ago, they did rejuvenate the zombie lore, and none pleased/scared me as much as the 2004 remake 'Dawn of the Dead.' Yes, I loved 'Shaun of the Dead' as well, but that was more dark-humor. 'Dawn' follows very closely the Romero original: All hell breaks loose, literally, one ""dawn"" and a group of survivors hold up in a shopping mall to figure out what to do, how to escape, survive and/or get rescued. Gone is the social commentary that had a lot of fans disappointed. Though I am a fan of the original, I wasn't one that was let down. I liked this one for the acting and realistic fear-factor. (In reality, I'd rather be up against Romero's zombies; you could all-but walk past them whereas here, if they see you, it's probably too late.) Polley: I love her! ('Go' is one of my favorites.) She is an excellent actress. Rhames was powerful. But probably the key element was Weber, whose very screen presence was astonishing. The rest of the group wasn't bad, but I think they did try their own social commentary by coincidentally putting all walks of life together, no two alike. It wasn't a perfect movie, but it's one I've seen at least a half-dozen times. Gore, soundtrack (this one introduced me to one of my now all-time-favorite songs: 'The Man Comes Around'), realism and tension all worked for me. Word to the wise: I didn't like to see the epilogue, so if you don't want to know what happens in the aftermath, stop the film when the credits roll.",Dawn of the Dead
39,bensonmum2,"""OK, I have an idea. We draw straws and the loser runs across the lot with a ham sandwich.""",6,13 May 2006,"I actually enjoyed Dawn of the Dead more than I thought I would. Not being the biggest fan in the world of the original, I found very little appealing about the thought of watching a remake. While my rating certainly doesn't indicate I thought it was a masterpiece, as a mindless action film, there's plenty to enjoy. Mindless? Shooting zombie after zombie in the head isn't what I would call thought provoking. But the scenes like the one in the sewers where our heroes are being chased by zombies sure is a lot of fun. However, as a horror movie, Dawn of the Dead is a failure. There appears to have been no attempt to create any atmosphere. Other than the scene in the parking garage, I never go that uneasy feeling horror usually produces. The horror that is there is too obvious and lacks subtlety that I find necessary for it to be really effective. Also, as there isn't really much of an attempt to flesh out the characters, it's difficult to care about the predicament they find themselves in.I've read any number of internet posts on what seems to be an endless debate about fast zombies vs. slow zombies. I actually see advantages and disadvantages to both. I find a slow moving zombie lurking in the shadows to be a far more frightening visage than the Carl Lewis style zombie. On the other hand, the fast moving zombies seem to present more of threat and work better in action sequences. Push come to shove, I suppose I would come down on the side of the slow zombies. The undead in Romero's Night of the Living Dead or Fulci's Zombi 2 work better for me because of their inherent creepiness.",Dawn of the Dead

41,bowmanblue,A remake they actually got right,10,15 February 2015,"It's become very fashionable to knock every single remake/reboot/re-envisioning that Hollywood comes up with. The idea it that they basically take a film that was popular a few years ago and film it again. Although what's churned out has very little to do with the source material apart from the name. It normally ends up being a soulless attempt at cashing in on the original's success via its name.Dawn of the Dead is one of the (few) exceptions to the rule.The original George Romero version is largely considered as the best zombie film going. It is indeed epic in length and has a smattering of social commentary regarding people's obsession with consumerism and spending all their time in shopping malls. The 2004 remake still has the zombies and the mall and, although some Romero die-hards will lament the lack of social commentary, most will appreciate it as a truly modern re-telling of the story. At least quite a few of the old 1979 version's cast make cameo appearances in the new version (playing new parts) which give us 'old school fanatics' a few in jokes to pick up on.Perhaps the 2004 version has its roots in the English film 28 Days Later which took the concept of zombies (or 'infected' as they were technically known) and made them run. Gone are the 1979 slow-moving 'shufflers' and here are some really nasty zombies who will even chase down a fast-moving car in order to rip apart their human prey.The 2004 version also has more characters. Granted some are a bit under-developed, but the majority play their parts well. The director, Zack Snyder, also deserves some credit at putting his own stylish spin on the direction, giving it a distinctive 'look' about it which elevates it over its numerous competitors.Granted Dawn of the Dead 2004 is not perfect. There are a few moments where daft things happen which are purely there to move along the plot and not really based on what would actually happen in such a situation. These faults I believe lie with the screenwriter. If you listen to the director's commentary, even he questions the characters' (and even zombies') motives for doing what they do. However, Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a case of there is so much good and right about it, that I think most people should be able to see past the few flaws and just enjoy it for simply being a decent action/horror film.If you only want to see one modern zombie film, I'd watch this one (or 28 Days Later, but, as any zombie enthusiast will tell you, there's NO zombies in 28 Days Later... technically).",Dawn of the Dead
42,MLDinTN,"lots of gore, better than a lot of recent horror movies",6,19 April 2005,"This was pretty gory, but of course, nothing like the original. Most of the plot is the same as Romero's: a group of survivors gather in a shopping mall waiting for rescue from the walking dead. The ending was different than the original and other parts were different, such as walking underground to an adjacent building.There were plenty of chainsaws and splicing through legs. One fat lady looked beyond disgusting before she turned into a zombie. I liked the way the film was shot. A good contrast of dark and light was used and parts of the film had a campy feel to it. For example, in the middle of the film, an upbeat music plays as they put together the driving vehicles.FINAL VERDICT: Worth a viewing if you like the horror genre.",Dawn of the Dead
43,Cineanalyst,Undead Remake,4,24 April 2020,"Remakes prove that even when a film is done and dead, it may be reanimated and, like the undead here, oft in a more sickly form. If you're looking for improved zombie make-up and effects and more frills in the flesh-eating and head-shooting action, this ""Dawn of the Dead"" may be for you, but if you expect a more compelling reason for one of the classics of the subgenre, George A. Romero's 1978 original version, to be remade, this is a pretty pointless endeavor. Between the additional cluttering of characters in this second iteration and continual set pieces of the living fighting the ghouls mixed with episodes of the living yelling at each other, one may be forgiven for not noticing the utter lack of comic relief, social commentary, or merely even trust in the audience to piece things together relative to Romero's film.The after-credits sequence here is a good example of how nothing is left to the imagination. With Romero, we may wonder what ultimately happens to the remaining heroes. Director Zack Snyder and writer James Gunn, instead, prefer to keep everything simplistic and tidy--something that also served them well with superhero franchises. At least, I suppose, this final sequence involves a character video taping it, which is rather unexpectedly reflexive. TV is also employed earlier on as surveillance and, as Romero did, for largely unnecessary news broadcasts. Regardless, there's also no insinuation, as with Romero, that the living are like zombies in their unreflective materialism, as well as with the warring with each other. Heck, the remake even goes to pains to explain the mechanics of zombies--head shots, effects of bites, etc.--as though we aren't already overly familiar with said conventions.It's no wonder the gang here is so eager to get on with what seems to be a suicide mission for the climax; they have little apparent reason to live in the first place. Families die. Jobs are gone. The only guy from a church is an atheist, while others consider an alternative worse than death. And chess, sex, shooting and smoking only entertain one for so long. Romero's group had lives inside the mall worth protecting and appreciated their bounty. This gang, on the other hand, just seem to be looking for a diversion to pass the time and overly willing to risk their lives for an adrenaline rush.",Dawn of the Dead
44,g-bodyl,Effectively Scary!,8,16 July 2013,"I'm not a fan of horror movies at all and I do my best to avoid them, but with zombies being the rage these days, I guess it was time for me to check this film out. It's a remake of the 1978 George Romero classic that I have yet to see, but as a stand-alone film, it's an effective scary film. It delivers the thrills, chills, and plenty of gore and blood.This is the feature film debut of Zach Snyder and it's an impressive debut. It's about how this mysterious virus spread by human bites that kill humans and turn their bodies into the living dead after they die. A group of survivors head to a mall and there they fight with all they got against these flesh-eating monsters.The acting is pretty good. I hear from other people that the acting is better than the original. Unlike most horror films, you get to care for the main characters and feel sympathy towards them. Sarah Polley is pretty good in the lead. Ving Rhames is very good as the hard-nosed cop and I liked Michael Kelly as the slimeball mall guard who goes through a change in personality over the course of the film.Overall, this is all you can want in a horror film. It has good chills and the creature designs are excellent. The makeup is effectively scary. This is most likely the movie that started the zombie rage that is currently taking place. It's a fine horror movie, but nothing more than that. I was pleasantly surprised. I rate this film 8/10.",Dawn of the Dead

46,CuriosityKilledShawn,Absolutely STUNNING remake!,10,29 April 2004,"I really knew nothing of Dawn of the Dead 2004 until I saw the preview. No trailers, no TV spots, no hype. So I was quite surprised at how breathtaking it is, moving at a neck-breaking pace and not letting up on the gut-wrenching tension for the entire running time. The critics and majority of the audience agreed, something damn rare for a remake.While many remakes are easy, pointless cash-ins on previous success and a quick way to mooch a few dollars off fans, DOTD 2004 is something quite different. Both Dawn of the Dead movies are great for their own reasons. And while most will judge this a remake only and do nothing but compare it with its 1978 counterpart, it's really best to watch them a two separate stories happening at the same time.Young Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) is living the suburban dream: perfect house, loving husband, well-manicured cul-de-sac. All that is about to change. As she drives home after a long shift dozens of clues surrounding the brewing trouble literally fall on deaf ears as Ana is too tired to notice. Overnight, her life is changed forever (as anyone's life can) when a lethal virus, that causes the dead to come back to life, spreads with alarming speed all over the world. Utterly, completely, hopelessly outnumbered, Ana flees her perfect life and hooks up with a bunch of other survivors who take refuge in a huge shopping mall.I will not pretend that the satire of the original is something of my own discovery (as so many, many other reviewers have) and complain that it's pretty much absent in the remake because DOTD 2004 has so many other levels to it.First of all, the zombies (the word is never mentioned in the film) can be seen as the perfect society. There is no conflict between them, no hate, no prejudice, and no grudges. They exist only to create more, as humans invariably do. The survivors barricaded in the shopping mall are rebels. They are refusing to conform and fight for their life, for their right to be different. And with this right to be different comes conflict and turmoil. The barricade between inside the mall and outside the mall is the line between the western world and the third world. Indulgent, ignorant and wasteful on one side and starving masses grabbing for whatever food they can on the other.DOTD 2004 offers a wider range of characters (more zombie nosh!) boarded up in the mall: cop, nurse, hoodlum, survivalist old lady, pregnant woman, security guards, gay guy, arrogant playboy millionaire, pretty girl and average Joe. It could be argued that they're a far more PC assortment of characters than the original (DOTD 1978 had 2 SWAT cops and 2 reporters-the very people we rely on to protect and inform us in times of crises-chickening out of their utterly futile duties to fend for themselves) but it ends up with character arcs and a sense of sticking together to survive, despite differences, that the original didn't have.The cast is well chosen and all act their parts brilliantly. Horror films have severely declined in recent years with most being turned into 20-something teen soap-opera trash. In DOTD 2004 you'll see a realistic group of people dealing enormous pressure with sense and reason. However, there is one particular moment in which a complete idiot character jeopardises the security for everyone else for the dumbest and stupidest of reasons. It really bugs me that this device is in the film and it damages DOTD 2004 and prevents it from having any everlasting integrity.There are a few references to the original (I'd hate to call them 'in-jokes' as that term would be kind of inappropriate for a film of this nature) that fans will have fun picking up on. But mostly the characters and situations featured in DOTD 2004 are completely new. The most interesting of which is the gun store owner across the street from the mall who communicates with Ving Rhames with his whiteboard and marker pen.Writer James Gunn (Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed) unleashes an entirely new monster this time. Many people have strongly complained at the 'fast zombie' type seen in this movie and (the absolutely awful) 28 Days Later. But they are far, far, FAR more terrifying than the slow, sluggish, rigger-mortis stricken corpses in the original. They'd be on you, ripping you're throat out before you can say 'crikey!' Yes, the 'turning times' vary wildly in the movie, but it all depends on the bite and how bad it is.I had never heard of Zack Snyder before seeing this movie, but for a debut feature he sure has impressed me. Every scene in this film is shot and lit from an identifiable point of view. This could be YOUR shopping mall in YOUR town. Not some fantasy happening far away. It's these kind of qualities that make DOTD 2004 stay with you longer than Darkness Falls or Scream 86. I'm glad that Hollywood can still make horror films as bloody and relentless as this, though there were several cuts made to the theatrical version.This new Directors Cut DVD runs 110 minutes and features more gore, bridging scenes, more character development, more violence and the odd restored shot here and there. It really is the definitive cut of the film to have and I urge you to buy this version.Filmed in Super-35 the DVD presents the film in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. A truckload of extras include Commentary by director Zack Snyder and Producer Eric Newman, The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed, Special Bulletin: We Interrupt This Program!-complete news coverage of the attacks, deleted scenes, Raising the Dead and Attack of the Living Dead featurettes and Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads.",Dawn of the Dead

50,poe426,What Richard Matheson by way of George Romero has wrought...,10,8 February 2005,"Filmmaker George Romero has often cited Richard Matheson's classic SF shocker I AM LEGEND as the inspiration for his chiller NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. In Matheson's short story, DANCE OF THE DEAD, a ""loopy"" comes twitching to life before a crowd of onlookers (""loopy"" being a play on ""Lifeless Undead Phenomenon""). Unlike the vampires in I AM LEGEND, the zombie in DANCE OF THE DEAD is slow-moving and uncoordinated. Like the walking dead in Romero's classic(s). (Or perhaps Romero found inspiration in the first feature based on Matheson's I AM LEGEND, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH; certainly the living dead in Romero's movie mimic the ponderous, slow-moving vampires therein- not to mention the undead in INVISIBLE INVADERS.) In the ""remake"" of DAWN OF THE DEAD (a remake in name only), the zombies are even closer to the vampires that originally inspired them. They are no longer the lumbering, slow-moving creatures that we've all come to know and love. Like the zombies in RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, the reflexes haven't slowed since death. This makes for an even bleaker scenario than in the Romero films (in which there often seems to be, somewhere in the gloom, a faint ray of hope, however dim): not only do you need to be faster than the guy next to you, you need to be able to outrun creatures impervious to pain; creatures dying, if you will, to taste your very flesh... The film starts off well, but begins to lose focus as characters crowd in on one another, with ""throwaway"" victims introduced just minutes, in some cases, prior to their deaths. (It's hard- if not impossible- to feel for these ""throwaways,"" as we learn very little about them.) The interplay between the principals, however, more than makes up for the shortcomings of the diversionary deaths. (In all frankness, the gratuitous gore is a given in these movies- it's part of their allure-, but makeup fx alone do not a worthwhile feature make.) All in all, a topnotch entry in the (sub-)genre.",Dawn of the Dead
51,johnnyboyz,"It's better than the original because it's faster, better paced and doesn't have any 'consumer society' nonsense in it.",8,2 September 2007,"It's a reworking of a 1970s, George A. Romero cult classic and its premise is a load of people in a mall with zombies trying to get them: sounds like a recipe for disaster, right? Wrong because Dawn of the Dead (2004) is anything but.I think I was one of the few people who liked this film so much, it actually made me want to dislike the original even more. I'd seen the 1978 version twice before this one and now I've seen this one twice, I can safely say that it is better. Romero's original is sort of weak and how it managed to gain its cult status is a little beyond me. Its premise of: 'stuck in a mall with zombies all around you  what do you do?' still works in this version but Romero's sloppy direction, sloppy editing, poor script and lack of a star cast to give it good acting are four reasons why I didn't take to it. Maybe people like it in the same vein people like 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' (1959) but are too fickle to admit that Dawn of the Dead is a cult film because it's so bad.This reboot rights some wrongs and at the same time tells a story in a quick, pleasing, bloody and suspenseful way which makes it so enjoyable. The set up is focuses on speed more than anything as ignoring some plot details yet adding in a few of its own. We don't know where the disease that turns people into zombies comes from and we don't really know an awful lot about Ana (Polley) our protagonist apart from the fact she's a nurse and has maybe a husband or boyfriend that is removed almost as quickly as he is introduced. In fact, the film is so fast in its set up that the little girl that Ana has two confrontations with (the first being outside and all friendly, the second being quite the opposite) I mistook as her daughter.What Dawn of the Dead does that keeps it eerie and entertaining is that it mixes up several elements to keep it going. We are given the customary group of survivors of different ethnical race, age and social background and then given some more when they get to the mall in the form of security guards and then some more the next day in the form of even more survivors who have made their way to the mall. All these people add up to good zombie fodder for when the time comes but Dawn of the Dead doesn't just do it in an immature and guilty way because it retains sensibility of its situation and incorporates well set up and suspenseful action scenes as well as including gore, humour, action and feint romance whenever necessary. Not only does it get the basics right but it spaces them nicely. We never get overloaded with gore or manic gunfire; we are also spared the numerous shots of zombies on the outside looking in through windows or extensive shots of shop fronts as zombies trudge past them like we weren't spared in the original. The reboot also adds in running zombies and even child zombies which act as an interesting spin on zombies on a whole (the running part obviously inspired by 28 Days Later).Whatever faults the film does have often are there to invoke tension or push forward the plot. No, I don't think the dog could have been that intelligent and yes, I feel the zombies would've gone for it  no, I couldn't believe the intelligence of Nicole when she puts herself at unbelievable risk just to save the dog and I was also confused over the fact Ana shows no emotion or sadness towards her partner from the first ten minutes.I feel the running zombies are not just mere copies from 28 Days Later but signify a deeper meaning: where the 1978 version of this film's zombies trudge and moan  this version's run and scream. The remake, just like its zombies; is faster, louder and better.",Dawn of the Dead

54,Anonymous_Maxine,"It's a weird, weird time when a remake of a horror classic is getting better reviews than the new Tom Hanks movie.",9,10 May 2004,"Zack Snyder, who at the time of this writing is such a new director that his photo is not even posted on the great IMDb, has started off his career by reminding the world that the horror genre is not quite dead yet, that it is not doomed to spout endless crap like I Know What You Did Last Summer, Jeepers Creepers I and II, House of the Dead, Cabin Fever, etc. Rob Zombie did a wonderful job of jumpstarting the horror genre with his wonderfully unapologetic House of 1000 Corpses, and I have to say that I was endlessly thrilled to see this remake of a horror classic come off so successfully, especially since modernizations of classics generally tend to strike me as little more than cashing in on past successes due to a current lack of ideas.The revised Dawn of the Dead comes at a time when the cineplexes are saturated with bad horror escapades, not the least of which are mentioned above, with others including Resident Evil, 28 Days Later, Gothika, etc. All of the standard remake things are there, the famous actors, the enhanced comic relief, bigger special effects (and, much less common, also better), and also in this case, importantly clarified plot points. It was nice to see the characters act more logically than was displayed in the original, the ridiculous biker gang was scrapped in favor of better zombies, a group of touristy people who show up in their motor home, a guy on the roof across the parking lot (tempting the cast and the viewers with the fact that he is heavily armed because he's on top of a gun shop) and one of several mall security guards, constantly demanding authority.Ving Rhames takes on the lead role in the film, leading the cast because he's a law enforcement officer, but also challenged by the jerk security guard mentioned above, determined to be obeyed to the point that it endangers all of them. He's the only really irritating character, wanting to basically imprison everyone except himself because he is so distrustful, which is strange since they are hiding from the walking dead who are all instantly recognizable. These people are all struggling for their very lives, what does he think they're going to do, steal from The Sunglass Hut?
The zombies themselves have been upgraded as well. In the first film (as well as the original Dawn of the Dead), they are slow, loping creatures similar to the killers in slasher movies. They're extremely slow-moving but scary because they're so relentless. In this movie, not only do the zombies move fast, they run and even jump. In the original Dawn, they wouldn't even duck down to get past an obstacle. They were so mentally absent that they would simply keep walking into an obstruction over and over, like one of those little robots from Stephen King's The Waste Lands.
(spoilers) Much of the plot has been changed for the remake. There is no snide content about the innate need to shop that was mentioned in the original film (maybe this has become so deeply ingrained that they were afraid the audience would be genuinely offended this time?), there is no biker gang, there is much more worry about what is going on in the rest of the world (concentrating on a particular rescue post that they are desperately trying to come up with a way to get to), and the final escape attempt is made in a boat rather than a helicopter. Today's audience is too impatient to watch these people struggle for their lives in this mall while they had a helicopter on the roof.
Also, the zombies are no longer the bad guys, just the walking dead who have no control over their actions. The idiot who kept hooting and hollering until he was attacked several times by the zombies in the original Dawn once referred to them as `bastards,' in this movie the characters are simply trying to escape from them. Their confused wandering as seen from the rooftops in this movie may even be an attempt to create sympathy for the people that these creatures once were. Unfortunately, in the absence of a real antagonist they decided instead to have this one security guard act like a complete jerk to everyone until they have to lock him up in the mall's holding cell, until he miraculously has a change of heart late in the film so that his anger doesn't render him a loose end.One of the things that I liked about the movie was that the black guy was one of the powerful characters. This is to be expected from Ving Rhames, but unfortunately there was another black guy whose portrayal is not as easily deciphered. Mekhi Phifer plays Andre, the guy with the very pregnant wife. I liked that he is portrayed as more interested in saving the life of his wife and baby than in his own well being, but then when his wife and baby are both turned into zombies, one of the other characters runs into the room, sees the zombie tied to the bed (where she gave birth to the zombie baby) and shoots her. Andre, still foolishly thinking that the zombie was his wife, accuses the woman of killing his family, and so pulls out a gun and shoots her as she shoots him. Yes, the black guy was the strong character in the movie, but does the other black guy have to get shot by the woman that he's shooting?That being said, I guess I have to admit that it is one of several clever scenes that were invented for the remake. Nothing even remotely like this appeared in the original film, especially with the baby zombie. Oddly enough, the baby zombie was one of the funniest moments in the film, a reaction about which I'm not sure I should be amused or repulsed. But hey, I thought it was funny, too, so I guess I shouldn't say anything. I think that a pretty big point of a movie like this is that it is meant to be funny (hence the success of such scenes as the one where Rhames holds up a sign for the guy across the way to pick out and shoot people in the wandering zombie crowd who look like celebrities.There are some great additions to this version in the escape as well, one of which surprisingly utilizes the cute dog in the movie. The characters find a couple of vans in the mall basement and turn them into heavily armored transport vehicles, with the intended purpose of taking them to the dock, where one of the characters has a boat that they may all use to escape the horror of the mainland. Interesting ideas are hatched as far as keeping the zombies from climbing onto the outside of the vans. There are some genuinely creepy scenes in the opening of the film, one of which involves a little roller-blading girl, also invented for this version of the movie.I think that really the only way that the movie slips up is that it has sort of thinned the depth of its plot, although this is done in favor of one that makes more sense. The zombies are faster and smarter, living humans do not fight other living humans beyond the struggle with the one security guard (a conflict which pales in comparison to the trigger happy biker gang in the original film), and they still try to escape even though it seems clear that the zombies would eventually starve in whatever way they starve, since they have turned so many people into zombies that they have successful eradicated all of their food. Kind of like what would have happened in Blade had the vampires succeeded in the mass domination scheme which was their self-terminating goal. I would think that one good reason to wait until the zombies started to run out of gas is the little fact that they happen to be in a shopping mall, in which they could conceivably find enough sustenance to survive for weeks.Luckily, in this installment, the rescue post that has reportedly become an outpost for the few remaining survivors of the human race is a pretty tempting destination. I have to admit that I would not be that anxious to sit around for weeks waiting for the zombies to die if I knew that the only survivors on the outside may have become zombies themselves by then.
Oddly enough, despite being a bigger and better version of a 1978 movie that fell flat largely because it was bigger than it's predecessor, the Dawn of the Dead remake also redeems itself by ironically maintaining some of the series' original simplicity. The special effects, budget, actors/acting, and story are heavily improved, but the movie smartly avoids one of the pitfalls of many recent horror films, which is to have a trendy soundtrack to sell. There are two versions of a wildly popular Disturbed song, but other than that mostly the only music on the soundtrack is the tinny, boring mall music which, at a few points, is the only sound onscreen at all, which is a great effect which alludes back to the simplicity of the original Night of the Living Dead. Evidently this clever mix of high-technology and low-budget filmmaking makes for a good combination for modern horror. Now can other filmmakers actually notice this time?",Dawn of the Dead
55,southdavid,Shopping Maul.,8,6 June 2021,"Having completed the Romero aspect of the pre-""Army of the Dead"" we're now going to pick up a few of the spares starting the Zack Snyder's calling card, his reimagining of ""Dawn of the Dead"". My recollection of the film was that I enjoyed it almost as much as the classic original and was happy to discover that this was still the case.Ana (Sarah Polley) awakes one morning to discover her neighbour's daughter in the house, confusion turns to horror when the zombified girl attacks and kills her husband. Fleeing for her life, she sees that her neighbourhood is being quickly overrun by the undead. Meeting a small group of survivors, she ends up at the local shopping mall. Despite the relative safety of the building, eventually the supplies start to run low and the group come up with a dangerous plan of escape.Though nearly twenty years old, ""Dawn of the Dead"" still stands up. It's really quite dark, with plenty of people, even children, meeting violent ends but somehow it still feels fun. It's a lot more of an action film than the original, and so rarely stops moving and has a couple of set pieces whilst the gang are at the mall, before leaving and heading for the conclusion. The zombies being ""28 Days Later"" fast ones works in differentiating this from others in the genre and the gore and CGI work is all pretty solid.As per a James Gunn script, I enjoyed the use of licenced music across the film. I would say that the characters aren't that memorable, certainly not compared the original.A lot of fun though, and for my money up there with ""Watchman"" as Zack Snyder's best film.",Dawn of the Dead
56,FiendishDramaturgy,It's a Great Remake But Completely Unnecessary.,6,8 January 2009,"I think I like the original better. I do NOT like fast moving zombies. They just freak, me right the heck out. This lacks the light easy comedic element found in the original, but has a harder, edgier feel. It is, therefore, more reflective of the new generation, but I'm not sure that's what's best for this franchise.Either way, If you are interested in this film, you should definitely watch the original and be your own judge. That's always the best way to go, don't you think? This bears some shocking elements, some sad, others unthinkable, so if you have a weak heart or a squeamish tummy, don't attempt it. This is a zombie movie unlike the rest of the line. This one gives its viewers a completely different take on the whole flesh-eating zombie thing.All in all, it's a great remake but I found it completely unnecessary. Go figure.It rates a 5.5/10 from...the Fiend :.",Dawn of the Dead
57,Captain_Couth,Remake Mania: Dawn of the Dead,8,31 October 2004,"Dawn of the Dead (2004) was pretty good. I was very surprised when I saw this movie on V.C.D. a few months back. I have to say that I was very impressed. The script by James Gunn and the direction was on par with the original. Ving Rhames was the man. He played his role quite well and was creditable as the tough cop. The set pieces were up to snuff and the gore effects were excellent.A strange mutation has quickly spread across the land. It hit so fast and so hard that nobody was prepared for what was to come. Society collapsed along with the military and the government's ability to try and contain the situation. Thousands of the living dead roam the streets and what's left of the survivors are either squabbling, bickering or killing each other off. A local mall as become a magnet not only for survivors but for the hungry and ever growing horde of the living dead. A nurse, cop, a family man and a young couple seek refuge in the mall that's under the control of three security guards who are still ""on duty"". Can any of them make it through the ""dawn"" so they can survive another ""day""?Like I said before hand. A very good remake of the original. Instead of trying to do a scene for scene remake or an ""inspired"" by version, the film makers wisely incorporated both elements to create this release. I haven't seen the new director's cut yet but from what I have already watched I have to say that I'm very impressed. Impressed indeed!Highly recommended!AKeep an eye out for three stars from the original film. A nice treat fro fans of the original film.",Dawn of the Dead
58,freemantle_uk,Surprisingly good remake,8,18 February 2010,"This film had all the hallmarks of being a disaster: it was was based on a very popular and critically acclaimed horror, it was directed by a first-time director and was going to take a glossy approach compared to the original. But luckily the first-time director was Zack Snyder, a man who was known for doing adverts, and a man who picks his projects carefully. He ends up doing the important and making a good re-make of a horror classic.In the American state of Wisconsin the zombie virus suddenly spreads, causing death and destruction around the world. In the middle of this is Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who has to go on the run after her husband and friends are turned. She joins up with a group of survivors, including a cop/former marine Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Michael (Jake Weber), petty criminal Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant wife Luda (Inna Korobkina). They decide to hold themselves up in local shopping mall with a team of security guards. More survivors join them, but soon becomes clear that they could only stay in the mall for a limited amount of time, especially with the survivors turning on themselves.As stated, Snyder is a director who picks his projects carefully. He rejected the chance to direct SWAT because it wouldn't be R-rated, and later on rejected doing X-Men 3 because he wanted to do 300, and rejected doing Wolverine because it wouldn't be R-rated and so he could direct Watchmen. Some first-time directors are so desperate to direct a Hollywood, that they don't think about the consequences for their career. But this didn't happen to Snyder. Horror remakes often repeat the same plot of the origin, but have more glossy violence, and making the film a boring experience. What Snyder and the writers avoid this: they follow the same basic plot, survivors are under siege in a mall, but they make a different film to George A. Romero, following a different storyline.Snyder shows his skill as a director, films some fine action scenes, showing he can deliver a few good scares and makes a exciting gore action (it is acceptable for zombie films to be gory). The opening is particularly good moment, with good scares, a shot scene involving Ana driving her car away from her house, and with a zombie following her. The opening credits were also well used to show the impact the rise of the zombies with news footage around the world. Snyder also casts some actors more famous for smaller roles. Ving Rhames is a talented actor and he role was very similar to Ken Foree in the original. Mekhi Phifer too is a good actor, and a decent bit of casting. Sarah Polley was a compelling led and with Ving Rhames made a good team. However some of the acting does slip a little at times.The remake never has George A. Romero's political message about American consumerism. They is a little nod to American militarism but that was really an after thought then any real political insight. This film just sets out to be fun, popcorn version of this story. Snyder was also influenced by Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, allowing the zombies to run. This must have been because of that film's success and try and make Dawn of the Dead more action packed.A good remake and a good debut for Snyder.",Dawn of the Dead
59,strong-122-478885,"Like, Even Shaun Of The Dead Was 10x Better Than This",3,12 September 2011,"Yep. It's true. This review may contain a ""spoiler"", or 2.You know, after watching this less than frightening ""Dawn Of The Dead"" remake - I seriously think that Director Zack Snyder should return, like, pronto, to directing TV commercials for BMW and Gaterade. He really should. 'Cause if Dawn Of The Dead (DOTD) is really supposed to be a sample of Snyder's work as a feature-film Director, then I think it stinks.I mean, let's face it, Snyder doesn't have the knack for sustaining horror in his picture, nor does he have the ability for developing interesting characters, or even creating an involving storyline. This is all so clearly evident in this little debut feature film of his.Believe me, the spine-tingling, rapid-fire images that one sees during the opening credits of DOTD are 10x more terrifying than anything we are shown in the actual picture. In my opinion DOTD only came to life in its final 15 minutes and by that point I was so bored out of my mind by it all. I mean, this movie offered absolutely nothing new to the viewer. And, if that wasn't bad enough, DOTD lapsed, far too often, into a regular, little soap opera of bickering, betrayal, and back-biting amongst the non-zombies.In my opinion, all the in-fighting amongst the folks at Crossroads Mall got so tedious at times that I seriously began to wonder who the real monsters were here - The dysfunctional humans? - Or - The flesh-devouring zombies? I mean, if there actually was a choice to be made in the matter, all I can say is - At least the zombies knew exactly what they wanted.And speaking about the zombies here in DOTD, like, what was this breed, anyways? They seemed to be just ""biters"" not ""eaters"". Whatever happened to zombies who took the time to actually devour a person alive? 'Cause unless I blinked when it happened, DOTD certainly lacked this very integral part of any zombie's relevant existence.And, so, in conclusion - I can't begin to tell you how truly disappointed I was with DOTD. Here I was all prepared to have the socks scared right off of me (in the same fashion as 28 Months Later freaked, me out, big time), but it just didn't happen.This remake certainly made the original 1978 version seem positively sensational by comparison. This film was so bloody dreary at times that even the birth of the zombie baby, as cute as he/she was, seemed somehow trite and altogether anti-climatic in the long run.Yep. Before it's too late - Let's send Zack Snyder back to directing TV commercials. Pronto!",Dawn of the Dead
60,Stevieboy666,How to make a remake,8,30 October 2021,"I saw this remake of the 1978 Romero zombie classic at the cinema in 2004, I didn't realise back then that it was the cut theatrical R version. I have just now thoroughly enjoyed revisiting it, this time uncut on DVD. Early on in we see nurse Ana Clark (Sarah Polley) finishing work and driving to her suburban home to the tune of ""Have a Nice Day"" by The Stereophonics. Unknown to her her young daughter is a zombie, who then rips her husband's throat out, he then becomes one too. Ana escapes by the skin of her teeth, she is indeed not having a nice day! She soon meets cop Ken Rhodes (Ving Rhames), the pair, along with a few other survivors, make their way to a shopping mall. Whilst the mall is central to both the original and the remake the 2004 version is more of a reimagining, not a scene for scene remake. Which is no bad thing. Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames make two great lead characters, he has had some bad parts in some bad movies but shines here. A nice touch has Tom Savini and Ken Foree from the original appear in small roles. There is a ton of gore and violence, a bit of nudity and also some great humour. Despite being a very good film there are a few things that I didn't go much on. Firstly I am not keen on zombies that can sprint like Usain Bolt, I prefer the shuffling type. Secondly much of the special effects use CGI, not a fan of them myself. And thirdly at times the movie looks like a MTV music video. However, for a directional debut Zack Snyder did a great job, Dawn (2004) was made during a time when horror remakes and zombie films were being churned out left, right and centre. This is easily one of the best examples on both counts. Not as good as the 1978 original but as remakes go this one is highly recommended.",Dawn of the Dead
61,dfranzen70,"Gory, but not scary.",4,3 November 2004,"Pardon my impertinence, but aren't zombie movies supposed to be scary? Or are they supposed to be funny? After watching this remake of George A. Romero's 1978 thriller (itself a sequel to 1968's Night of the Living Dead), I'm all confused. To sum up, some kinda plague thingy breaks out, turning nearly everyone into jibbering idiots. After a while, it's hard to tell which ones are zombies and which ones have simply been watching too much election coverage. All heck breaks loose. Loved ones are killing each other. Little kids, too. Everyone's gone all higgledy-piggledy.A hardy bunch of survivors makes its way to the most American of inventions, the shopping mall. They have all they need - food, shelter, TVs, XBoxes, and a zillion zombies patrolling outside the mall, desperate to get in and feast on the nice, fresh meat.Lemme stop for a minute here and wonder out loud. (Note: This is a rhetorical question.) Why do zombies need fresh meat? Why can't they just feast on each other, or even themselves? Would they even notice if they bit their own hand off, for example? (Okay, that was three rhetoricals.)So our intrepid gang barricades itself inside the mall. But they soon want to get out. They're holding out hope that somewhere out there, there's someone who's not quite dead yet. You know, somewhere where the zombies haven't quite taken over. Like Canada, or something. But we the viewers know better, don't we? This is as good as it gets, staying in a mall all the time. If it were me, I don't know if I'd ever leave. But oh, those nutty survivors. They're communicating with the crazy cat a building or so over via sandwich board, playing chess long distance and the like. We see all kinds of fun and exciting activities, all set to a peppy song, whose name and beat I have conveniently forgotten for all eternity.So they want to get out. Their plan is to commandeer two of the mall's shuttle buses, fortify the crap out of them, and off they go. Well, bad things happen. The end.This movie failed for me because at no point was I scared. I didn't jump out of my seat, or even shudder. Sure, there's gore, but it's pretty mundane. If you've seen one head explode, you've seen 'em all. (Oddly enough, when someone shoots a zombie in the head late in the movie, Ving Rhames is inexplicably impressed.) Movies like this need to have a strong sense of reality; the viewer must be able to imagine that this is happening Right Now, outside his or her own door. And this movie utterly failed to do so for me, which made it take on a surreal and ultimately comic sheen.The acting's no prize, either. I know these guys had little interesting or unique to say, but I felt little sympathy for them regardless - and that's the actor's job. Convey to me how awful your situation is. I wasn't openly rooting for the zombies, but sometimes I felt like it.One final nitpick - the ending credits sequence contains footage of What Happens Next. It's very, very jarring; credits are shown on a red background, then there's a quick cut to video, then back to the credits, on and on and on. Distracting and pointless.",Dawn of the Dead
62,dee.reid,"""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004)",10,30 October 2004,"Zack Snyder's 2004 revision of the 1978 action epic of zombie mayhem, ""Dawn of the Dead,"" is less a remake of George A. Romero's classic of the same title than it is its own individual vision of zombies and the survivors who band together to keep them out of the huge shopping mall they've barricaded themselves in.The new ""Dawn"" is not a better film than the original, but is better made and is more streamlined and fluid. The zombies in the revision run, instead of merely lurching up and down escalators or are otherwise slow to capture victims. These zombies are quite vicious and relentless in their pursuit of potential victims.I'm hesitant to call ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) a remake because in my opinion, what allows the new ""Dawn"" to surpass the 1978 version is that the new version doesn't try to outdo the original; it instead builds on that film's reputation. The original's idea of humans barricading themselves in a mall to avoid the hordes of flesh-hungry zombies that run rampant outside is only a template for the new version's more nefarious agenda of scaring the daylights out of the audience.The new ""Dawn of the Dead"" treads in places where Romero's film didn't  it delivers genuine shocks  not satire and is heavy on gore (which is extended in the director's cut) and characters you come to know and care about. Yet, you can't completely dismiss Romero's original. And whereas the mall in the original was a haven for the four main characters to keep the hording masses of zombies outside at bay, the mall in ""Dawn"" (2004) is merely a rest stop; the survivors here in 2004 aim to escape from the living dead as soon as possible.As a fan of George A. Romero's highly praised and daring ""Living Dead"" trilogy, it only seemed natural that a remake of the most popular film was reasonable. Already ""Night of the Living Dead"" was remade in 1990 and was directed by Romero's right-hand special effects man Tom Savini. As far as I can see, a remake of 1985's ""Day of the Dead"" is not that far off, as well as a FOURTH ""Living Dead"" film.And several 1978 ""Dawn"" alumni make cameo appearances: Ken Foree (""Peter"" in the original) plays a priest who delivers ""Dawn's"" most famous punch line (""When there is no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth""), Scott H. Reiniger (""Roger"" in the original) as a military general, and special effects wizard Tom Savini (""Blades"" in the original) as a sheriff leading an operation to eradicate the zombies.""When there is no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth"" has a greater relevance in the new ""Dawn"" because here, the zombies walking around and consuming the flesh of the living is seen to be a worldwide epidemic  the Apocalypse. In the original, the zombies were simply seen as more of a nuisance, not the end of the world.10/10",Dawn of the Dead

Stars: Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi PhiferDawn of the Dead is not just a good remake ..it is a good zombie film in general. 28 Days Later basically kicked started the zombie genre again in 2003 and in a sense helped this movie get green lighted. It shows that the zombie genre is in full force because Dawn of the Dead 2004 does not disappoint. The director Zack Snyder really knew what we wanted. He did not just do a remake and carbon copied the original. He made the film stand out on its own and one of the thing he added was fast moving zombies. In my opinion it worked and made the film intense.The movie waste no time getting to the blood and gore. Within the first 10 minutes we are treated to an intense zombie opening . Not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked; followed by one of the best opening credits ever. What better way to start off this bloody film than with Johnny Cash?This is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. Spoiler :a zombie baby. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. This is one hell of a horror movie.",Dawn of the Dead

There are a reasonable amount of shocks, most of them in the first few minutes before the credits have finished, and then repeated in formulaic fashion with predictable regularity. Needless to say, if you have to pop out for more popcorn, you won't miss much you couldn't guess.Standard horror fare, but fills the midnight movie gap well enough.Takes itself a bit too seriously considering it has little new to offer other than reviving some snappy editing . . .",Dawn of the Dead
66,jimbo-53-186511,The most idiotic film I've ever seen,2,26 February 2014,"I'll cut straight to the chase and openly admit that I did not like Romero's original 1978 version of this film. However, one thing I will admit is that compared to this mess Romero's original film was a 'masterpiece' (which is saying something considering I rated that film 4 out of 10). I'll attempt to explain the problems with this film one by one; 1) The basics; right from the start there were no scares, no tension, and no character development. Therefore, I wasn't impressed with Snyder's remake from the start, but then things went from bad to worse 2) Zombie infestation; once our protagonists enter the mall as a 'safe haven' (as they did in the original), we see 1 or 2 zombies attack our protagonists as presumably they've gained entry into the mall the same way that our protagonists did. Naturally, our protagonists overcome these zombies and manage to find their way upstairs where they bump into 3 security guards who reluctantly agree that they can seek refuge with them (I still wasn't overly impressed by this point, but still thought 'Well it's OK'). However, later in the film we see very little zombie attacks or infestations in the mall, what I couldn't understand is why a few zombies managed to gain entry at the start, but couldn't gain entry later? It just removed any modicum of tension that the film had originally built up. Why couldn't they get in afterwards? Had they turned the mall into Fort Knox? Completely illogical3) There is another scene where our protagonists venture out into the car park and they are set upon by zombies. I thought at this point; OK, fair enough they may have been able to find their way into the car park, but then our protagonists spend considerable time modifying 2 RV's in the underground car park without any problems from the zombies. How did they manage this? Were the Zombies having 40 winks? 4) The signs; OMG What the hell was that all about? Initially Kenneth (Rhames) and Andy (Bruce Bohne) write notes on large boards in order to communicate with each other. What made me laugh is that over an hour into the film they send a dog across the zombie infested area between the mall and Andy's gun shop with a bag strapped around its waist with a walkie talkie in it to Andy (who owns a gun shop and is one of the only other survivors - his reason for survival is self evident). This is so that Andy and Kenneth can communicate more easily. Why did they need walkie talkies and hand written boards to communicate? Had the scriptwriters forgot that it was 2004 when this film was made? The age of the 'mobile phone' - this whole situation could have been resolved by one of them saying 'Hey Buddy, this is stupid, write your number down on the next card and I'll text you'. 5) Mobile phones; nobody seemed to have one. I could understand if this was meant to be set in an age before mobile phones existed, but it clearly isn't so the fact that no-one has a mobile phone makes no sense. They see a helicopter fly past which doesn't rescue them even though they have a big SOS labelled on the roof; why it never picks them up and why another helicopter wasn't sent is never explained. Surely if someone had a mobile, all they would have needed to do would be to make a 911 call and ask for a helicopter to be sent to a specified location point in order to rescue them. This is what makes this film so flawed as in 1978 when they were isolated in the mall, they really were 'isolated' as the original film was made before mobile phones were invented so this made the premise in the original film slightly more plausible. In 2004, in the age of the mobile phone it doesn't work so well.I'm sure there are other problems but I feel I've made my point plus I'm in danger of exceeding the 1000 word limit if I continue much longer. I hate this film (as you'll have gathered) and the only reason I've given the film 2 stars is because of Ving Rhames' performance). Rhames managed to give some credibility to proceedings and was definitely a 'diamond in the rough' In summary, this was a horrible film that makes the 'lacklustre' original look like a masterpiece. In hindsight, I now wished that I'd avoided it, but the optimist in me said 'Give it a chance'. I really wish I hadn't have bothered.",Dawn of the Dead

Screenplay is rightly paced. It seems that it is more mature movie in it's genre.The only drawback of the movie is some flaws such as the husband of main character turns into zombie into seconds but other took lots of time and Luda wife of one of the character Andre took days to turn into zombies, but still this is one of the finest zombie movie.",Dawn of the Dead
68,drownnnsoda,"I'm Not A Zombie Fan, But I Liked This.",8,23 March 2005,"The ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake is one good zombie flick, I'm the first to admit it. I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies, I prefer slashers and supernatural horror, but this movie stuck in my mind for a while and was an excellent remake of the zombie classic. It basically is the same plot line as George Romero's original version- people hiding out in a shopping mall after zombies began to walk the earth and mankind begins to die off. The group of people who wind up in the mall begin to bond and form friendships, while the dead are outside taking over the world. They think they are safe, but little do they know, one of the women staying with them was bitten by a zombie, and is now giving birth to a zombie infant. As time goes on and they begin to run out of natural necessities, they face the fact that they can only stay in the mall for so long, before they run out of food and water. They decide it's best to break out of the mall and fight against the zombies in a mad dash for survival.The performances in this film were great, Sarah Polley was excellent as the leading heroine in the film. The characters here kick some serious zombie ass, but sadly they fail in the end, and the zombies win (you have to watch the entire credits to actually see this). The interactions with the characters were genuine and well acted, it was interesting to watch them as they go through such a drastic and bad situation. Can you imagine zombies taking over the world? The gore and zombie makeup effects looked great, and there were plenty of action sequences that were enjoyable and entertaining to watch. I especially enjoyed the scene where the characters actually break out of the mall, armed with a load of weapons, in their zombie-proof buses.The ending was abrupt and harsh, but I think it fit the brutality of the film very well. Bottom line is - good acting + good story + lots of gore = very good zombie film. All in all, this is an above average zombie movie, and horror fans should enjoy it. Not to mention, it's excellent for a remake. 8/10.",Dawn of the Dead

70,davispittman,Pretty well made remake,8,15 April 2017,"I won't be comparing this remake to the original dawn of the dead film because I haven't seen it. I'm just going to review it as a regular movie as if it wasn't even a remake. The movie begins with a nurse at her suburban home with her husband. They go to sleep and the next morning she finds a neighborhood girl that has been turned into a zombie and she of course runs to her car and escapes. She then discovers the zombie epidemic that has claimed the city in which she lives, and ultimately everywhere. She some other survivors drives to the mall and take refuge there. The acting is pretty good, all the actors give believable performances. The scare factor is definitely there, I thought the zombie attacks were creepy and had a very suspenseful feel to it. The only thing I didn't like as far as the killings go was the accidental ones, there's one character that accidentally gets killed by another survivor and I thought that was pretty stupid. That's really my only complaint as far as that goes, I wouldn't have minded if they were a little less gory but that didn't bother me all too much. The writing was fairly decent, better than your average horror film, which is refreshing to see. The movie has a high entertainment value, which is the only reason anyone would ever want to watch this movie. 8/10 for Dawn of the Dead.",Dawn of the Dead
71,hu675,Finally One of the Few Horror Remakes is Done Right.,8,20 April 2005,"Gruesome... But this surprisingly entertaining remake of the original 1979 classic from George A. Romero (Which Romero will have his fourth Zombie film ""Land of the Dead"" will be released this summer). Which it has the same basic idea from the original but different in tone and a new set of characters for this updated remake. When a group of survivors (Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer, Ty Burrell, Micheal Kelly, Kevin Zegers, Micheal Berry, Inna Korobkina, Lindy Booth, Kim Poirier, Boyd Banks, R.D. Reid, Jayne Eastwood and Matt Frewer) decide to take refuge on an abandon Shopping Mall hiding from mindless, flesh-eating zombies. Trying to Survive, while the human race is becoming erased and only becoming a bed-time story for campfire tales. Those handful of survivors are trying fight a desperate battle between the survivors and these zombies but only to stay alive.This remake is directed by first time filmmaker-Zack Snyder (Snyder's next film is Rainbow Six and 300). Snyder brings a lot of energy and style to this now-familiar story but equally impressive film. This remake is exciting, violent, funny and even touching. The film also has as well of some disturbing scenes. Original Dawn-Romero's message on commercialism is lost (Since the shopping malls is outmoded anyway). Synder brings some terrific action sequences towards the third act of the film. Synder is certainly new talented director with good movies for him to come. He's one of the few movie directors that Hollywood should watch for. One of the producers of this remake is Richard P. Rubinstein (Who produced the original Romero's classic). Rubinstein is one of few people, who stayed to be involved with the remake. Tom Savini (Who was the make-up effects artist and also had a bit part as Blades), Scott H. Reiniger (Who played one of the heroes:Roger) and Ken Foree (Who played the lead hero:Peter) do excellent cameos for this remake. The Unrated Director's Cut of the Remake is certainly much better than the original theatrical release not because of the extra gore or a bit more of characters development. The Unrated Director's Cut actually corrected some of the continuity story errors from the R-Rated Version and it also make a bit more sense. Sure, the remake has a few plot holes and maybe a bit too much characters are not enough focus in this remake (Since Jake Weber is the most focus character in the remake). But this new Dawn is well cast with good performances.DVD has an sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an superb-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an engaging Commentary track by Director:Zack Synder and Producer:Eric Newman. DVD also has Deleted Scenes with/without commentary by Synder and Newman. DVD has two amusing mini-movies that inspired for this Remake but the best of all is three featurettes on the make-up effects artist by Two-Time Oscar Winner:David LeRoy Anderson. Anderson won Two Oscars on Make-Up Effects for The Nutty Professor (1996) and Men in Black (1997). DVD Features could have used more like the Original Theatrical Trailer, Interview with the Actors and why Rubinstein wanted to do a Remake of Dawn. Which Rubinstein did a commentary track for the Extended Cut of the Original-Dawn on the Dead in the Ultimate 4-Disc Edition. The Remake of Dawn is almost perfect as the Original but the only real shortcoming of this remake is the surprise end-credits, which it does push things a little too far and it seems to come from a different movie. Was it really worth the trouble ? Since the surprise end-credits wasn't part of Screenwriter:James Gunn (Best Known for writing-Scooby Doo films) original screenplay. Top Screenwriters:Micheal Tolkin (The Player) and Scott Frank (Minority Report) did some re-writes for this remake, which they are uncredited. Super 35.

73,JoeKarlosi,A good zombie movie ***,7,9 January 2005,"I've always been known to trash needless ""remakes"" of films, and especially the more recent re-do's. I think it's become a celluloid disease that's really infested cinema these days and there aren't a whole lot of fresh ideas remaining, specifically in the Horror genre. Having gotten this out of the way, there are exceptions to every rule and all you die-hard Romero fans might as well get your stones ready for hurling at me right now, because I may actually like the 2004 version more than the 1978 film.In all honesty, other than spending some of its time in a shopping mall there really isn't all that much direct similarity between this new DAWN and the original; hell, this movie could have been called something else entirely (NIGHT OF THE ZOMBIES, 28 DAYS LATER or anything) and then it wouldn't have mattered to hardcore purists as much, because this film is very much its own animal. We all know that the real business reasoning behind using the title DAWN OF THE DEAD was to lure in the hardcore fan base. So it's best to approach this experience as just another ""end of the world""/""zombie takeover"" situation on its own terms.Still, comparisons (thanks to the title) are bound to crop up. I found these ghouls to be a refreshing change from the traditional slow-moving ones; I'd be much more terrified at having a carnivorous flesh-eating cannibal hot on my ass running after me than I would one of those old fashioned crawlers who could easily get knocked to the ground by a good sneeze from my nostrils. This doesn't mean I don't retain my fondness for the more limping, arthritic type of zombie of yesteryear; it just means I thought this change was welcome and posed a greater threat. Since whatever is ailing these creatures is never explained, I also had no problems believing it could make them speedy and even roar like wildcats. Hey, at least it makes them fearsome.It's been claimed that the characters in this new version are not sympathetic nor well developed, and I take serious issue with that... On the contrary -- it's the characters of the ""original"" DAWN OF THE DEAD whom I've never felt anything for. But in the 2004 film - and this is especially true regarding the favored Director's Cut - these people are exceptionally well defined and distinct from each other. There are heroes (Ving Rhames) and there are villains in this predicament (the security creep). Sweet guys and jerky guys (the dope with the boat is a perfect example of the latter). Guys you can feel sorry for (like Andy on the roof or that poor soul who has to face a crucial decision late in the fight). And no matter which version you prefer, Sarah Polley runs circles around Gaylen Ross in the Leading Lady Department.Zack Snyder is no genius (after all, he still allowed inappropriate hard rock music into the soundtrack for one thing), but he's directed a pretty good thriller with an end-of-the-world feel. This is especially felt in the knockout pre-credits sequence. There are plenty of exploding heads and gore to please fans of the original yet not go into overkill mode as happened the first time. It's not perfect and it's not as horrifying as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, nor is it as uncomfortably apocalyptic as DAY OF THE DEAD ... but for all intents and purposes that are forever open for debate, it IS more fun for me than that other Romero zombie film that fits between those two.",Dawn of the Dead
74,alansabljakovic-39044,Halloween is here,7,27 October 2018,"Unfortunately, I haven't seen the original but I think this one is great too. Great zombie movie with amazing soundtrack.

75,Jonny_Numb,a remake that has no right to be good (but is anyway)...,7,29 March 2005,"Not too long ago, Hollywood rode high on the crest of the teen-horror revival (begun by Wes Craven's ""Scream"") as a glut of winking slashers designed to make us nostalgic for the franchise staples of yesteryear(""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", etc.) became the main attraction at multiplexes the world over. Not surprisingly, what at first looked like a trend proved a mere fad and fizzled out in a fraction of the time it took to put Freddy and Jason down. These films were little more than self-conscious showcases for vapid pretty faces with little in the way of acting talent, and CGI-approved gore that made one nostalgic for hand-made FX.Therefore, with Hollywood running low on creative ideas (what else is new?), the teen-horror infatuation was abandoned (or perhaps more accurately, 'transposed') in favor of 'remake mania.' In hopes of snaring both the curious and ignorant, those charming studio executives have shamelessly gone for the throat--especially in the horror genre--in cranking out one soulless remake after another. We're at the point now where there's a direct correlation between using horror remakes as an excuse to launch the film careers of music-video directors, and the results are accordingly shallow product. This raises the question of the necessity of remakes, especially remakes of films that, in most regards, leave no room for improvement and at best will only be perceived as failed hackwork? Why not create a good film out of one that is a piece of unredeemable garbage? Paradoxically, the films of Ray Dennis Steckler or Ed Wood, while incendiary, low-budget, and considered by many to be awful, still attract a cult following that would be just as upset as those who loved, say, George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" and were slack-jawed in horror at the notion of it being remade.With every reason to be skeptical and expectant of a rotten retread in the best-case scenario, Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" takes all the money-grubbing remakes of late (hello, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""!) to task, and in turn shows what a good remake should be. (At the very least, he shows a reverence that is seriously lacking in the horror genre.) As if aware of the sheer inability to match the wit, intelligence, and horror of Romero's original, screenwriter James Gunn (who previously scripted Troma films) takes the skeletal structure of the original and infuses it into a modern telescope. As before, we are introduced to the survivors of a plague that has swept the world, seeking refuge in a shopping mall. As opposed to the blue-faced, slow-moving zombies of Romero's original, the dead of ""Dawn 2004"" are rotten-faced speed freaks who dash crazily after humans who let their guard down. The details of the plague are left appropriately vague--Snyder is less concerned with the cause than he is with knocking you out of your seat (which happens time and again); whereas Romero's film was a more relaxed meditation on consumer culture, Snyder seldom allows time for the audience to catch their breath, as he is staging one elaborate jolt after the next. Oddly enough, this method consistently holds up, and while it can easily be decried as skimping on the depth of Romero's original, it glues you to the screen all the same, and in my opinion, that is a different kind of success.Granted, when the survivors start piling up, few ever get out of the first dimension, but dimension is irrelevant so long as the 1-D characters are given splatterific deaths (I was surprised the chainsaw dismemberment didn't give this an NC-17). After all, within the first few minutes we can pretty much tell who will be around at the climax and who won't. Perhaps there was more CGI used in this film than I noticed, and Snyder's gritty style (which employs a certain dank paleness) obscured it a bit; in any case, the zombie and human kills, and the way they are photographed, is presented with a rollicking intensity that few films of late have shown. ""Dawn 2004"" is what ""28 Days Later"" would have been had it jettisoned its preachy plot. Whether the decision to make the zombies fast-moving savages was an effort to create tension or appeal to our attention-deficit society, it works on both counts.Ultimately, ""Dawn 2004"" is an example of a remake done properly, even though I still have the vaguest notion of what a remake really should be. No, it doesn't come anywhere near Romero's social statement, nor his dynamic precision in presenting believable, everyday characters, but it entertains, it frightens, and is bloody fun to watch.",Dawn of the Dead
76,ShootingShark,Enjoyable But Predictable And Undistinguished Remake Of Zombie Horror Classic,5,30 January 2007,"Ana is a nurse who wakes up one morning to find the world has been overrun by an apocalypse; an infection communicated by bite has turned almost everyone into crazed cannibals. She hooks up with a group of uninfected people at a local shopping mall. Can they survive, and what does the future hold ?This remake of George A. Romero's classic 1979 low-budget zombie epic has good points and bad points, but overall is marred by poor direction. The cast are good - Polley, Rhames, Weber and Kelly particularly - the sets and makeup effects are great, the locations are good (Toronto doubles for Milwaukee) and there are some scary, effective scenes, notably the creepy birth sequence and the early shots of Ana driving through the madness. But the movie falls down badly in two areas for me. Firstly, James Gunn's script doesn't take the material anywhere new - it's essentially the original movie without the social commentary or the interesting, slow-paced, character-based, middle third. It alters the classic zombie mythology (the undead can run and jump, and anyone who dies naturally isn't reanimated) which is okay, but it doesn't go anywhere with the new ideas. It's chief sin however is that for a movie filled with action, the choreography and editing is poor. For an action scene to work we need to know where the characters are in relation to each other, how fast they are moving and what the physical space they are in is like. There are moments here (like the flight from the gun store to the sewer) where the coverage and the cutting is so lame we have no idea what's going on, and so there's no tension or suspense. Despite having the great cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti (who shot Poltergeist, Johnny Handsome and many other great flicks), Zack makes the classic MTV-director mistake of thinking that if he just cuts his scenes fast enough, with plenty of off-putting slow-motion shots thrown in that somehow that will make his movie exciting. He should go back and watch the biker gang attack sequence from the original movie and really look at how it's put together. I don't want to criticise this flick too much though - it's still a lot of fun, it's an updating of a great classic that everyone should see, and it has enough gore and scares to satisfy the gourmet horror fan. It does however have the most annoying end-title sequence I think I've ever seen in any movie. Co-produced by Romero's old business partner, Richard P. Rubinstein, and featuring cameos by original cast members Reiniger, Savini and Foree. Worth catching, but for those of us with more than a two-second attention span, check out Romero's superb new zombie flick instead - Land Of The Dead.",Dawn of the Dead

78,a_chinn,Unneeded remake is surprisingly good and satisfying for fans of the original,8,14 July 2019,"Surprisingly good remake of the George A. Romeo zombie apocalypse classic. It's tricky doing a remake of a beloved cult classic, so when I originally went to the theater to watch this film, I went in expecting to hate it, especially since the film was written by the same guy who wrote the terrible live-action Scooby Doo movie, along with some first-time director I'd never heard of and who'd only done music videos and commercials. However, right from the opening moments of the film, with a quiet suburban neighborhood quickly descending into a fight for survival from zombie hoards to when the opening credits roll to Johnny Cash singing ""When the Man Comes"" around, I was hooked! Little did I know that writer James Gunn would go on to write other terrifically smart and subversive mainstream genre films like ""Slither,"" ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" as well as the little seen low budget films like ""Super"" and ""The Belko Experiment"" and that director Zach Snyder would go on to tackle (more successfully than you'd expect) other sacred cows such as ""The Watchmen"" and ""Man of Steel."" Compared to Romero's original, this remake is minus the political subtext Romero infused into all of his zombie films, but it does manage to capture the original film's balance of comedy and horror. Both films are for the most part straight faced horror films, punctuated with moments of levity and black humor. The remake delved less into the audience fantasy aspect of getting to have the run of a shopping mall (similar to ""Night of the Comet""), but the humor Gunn placed into his script was arguably much more witty when compared to Romero's more pie-in-the-face style of slapstick comedy. The remake also boasts a strong cast that includes Sarah Polley (a nurse), Ving Rhames (a cop), Mekhi Phifer (an expectant father), Jake Weber (a nice guy), Ty Burrell (a rich jerk), and Michael Kelly (a mall cop). Another charm of the film for fans of the original is that while it does deviate from the original in many ways (running zombie instead of slow zombies, changing most of the characters and scenarios, and keeping really only the basic concept of people holding up in a mall during a zombie apocalypse), the filmmakers included many Easter eggs and nods to the original films, including a truck crashing into a diner (a nod to a story shared by Ben in the original film) or the mall being named after the lead actress in the original film, or cameo appearances by the three stars of the original film (Scott H. Reiniger, Tom Savini, and Ken Foree), and many others. Overall, the world did not need or ask for a ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, but Gunn and Synder managed defy my fanboy reservations and won me over to their new vision of Romero's horror classic. Well worth watching for fans of contemporary zombie films as well as for fans of the old school original film.",Dawn of the Dead

80,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Fun, Popcorn Take on a Classic",8,30 September 2020,"This film I will admit, I got caught in the hype learning that this was going to be made. The original was a staple of my childhood and still one of my favorite films of all time. I'm pretty sure I saw this movie in the theater when it came out, probably more than once. It was an immediate buy and I've seen this one quite a few times. The older I've gotten though, I've slowed down and it has been a few years. I did give this a rewatch as part of the Summer Challenge Series over on the Podcast Under the Stairs for the 2000's. The synopsis here is a nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman and other survivors of a worldwide plague that is producing aggressive, flesh-eating zombies, take refuge in a mega Midwestern shopping mall.We start this in a hospital where a doctor is looking at a CT scan of someone's head. The nurse with him is Ana (Sarah Polley). The doctor asks her why this scan was done when he was admitted for a bite. She goes to the front desk to find where the patient is and we learn that he is in the ICU now.She heads home where she speaks with the little girl that lives next door, Vivian (Hannah Lochner). She promises to go skating with this girl around the block after work this weekend. Ana then goes inside for date night with her husband of Luis (Louis Ferreira). They end up making love in the shower.The next morning they are woke up by Vivian. She is missing her lips and is covered in blood. Luis goes to check on her and she bites his neck. She is knocked out of the room and they close the door. He is losing a lot of blood. He dies on the bed while Ana tries to call an ambulance. The line is busy though, which doesn't make sense. He immediately turns into a zombie, chasing his wife into the bathroom. While he is breaking in, she escapes through the window. We see outside that everything is chaos and everyone is scared. Ana drives away.This cold open ends with her crashing over an embankment and over the credits we get to see a bit more of the scope. This is worldwide and no one is really sure what is causing it. The dead though are returning to life to eat the flesh of the living.When she comes to, she escapes her car and meets a police officer named Kenneth (Ving Rhames). He's heading for a nearby military base where his brother is stationed. They encounter another group of Michael (Jake Weber), Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant girlfriend of Luda (Inna Korobkina). It is disheartening for Kenneth to learn they can't get over the road, as it is thick with zombies. They've lost most of their group in an attempt.The group together decides to head to the nearby mall. They have to break-in, but find it relatively clear of the undead. They are locked up when they run into the security crew there. This group is led by CJ (Michael Kelly), Terry (Kevin Zegers) and Bart (Michael Barry). The guards don't really like the idea of sharing their place with these new people and they lock them up. When another group drives up in a panel truck, decisions are made and those in charge are now held prisoners.They soon learn that bites because you to become one of these things. The numbers swell with Norma (Jayne Eastwood), Tucker (Boyd Banks), Glen (R.D. Reid), Monica (Kim Poirier), Frank (Matt Frewer) and Steve (Ty Burrell) hold up here. They create some sort of normal life there, but the longer they stay, the more zombies congregate outside and making it that much more difficult to leave.That recap went a little bit longer than I wanted, but that really sets the stage for the movie. I've already given my history with the movie and I'll admit, there was a stretch there where naïve, younger me thought this could be better than the original. In my defense, I was a 17 year old kid when it came out and I was high on this movie.Now that I've settled in with some life experiences and appreciate cinema more, I've come down on this movie quite a bit. Getting into podcasts really helped me to see what others thought as well. Having now watched this for the first time in awhile with a critical eye, this does do some really good stuff.This version takes out a lot of the social commentary that the original had and makes it a popcorn film. That's not meant to be a slight though. This movie is still fun to watch in my eyes. Even though it runs 101 minutes it really does just fly by. What I really like to go with that, they incorporate elements from the original, while doing their own thing and not making it a shot for shot remake. That's not to say we don't get some social commentary here still.I like we a strong woman character as our lead in Ana. She is a nurse, so it makes her important and she is trying to hold on to humanity for the society they're living in. On the flipside there is Kenneth. He is a black cop who only cares about himself. He is quite similar to CJ, but being that he was already in the mall, they fall on opposite sides. I like that they're both tough, but crack to join the cause. Michael is a character that couldn't find a place until being here. Andre seems like a criminal, or at least that's what Kenneth thinks. It does feel a bit racist though. Then there is Steve. He's rich; he's a jerk and does nothing to help. He is reaping all of the benefits, so we are getting to see classism play out on a small scale. It is a good job to have all of these different characters from all different walks of life for sure.Something I do need to address in this movie is the zombies. They're fast moving, running zombies which I'm not the biggest fan of. I know some people are and I get the appeal. They can run after you and kill you, making even one of them dangerous, especially since it is only a blow to the head that will stop them. It is even more terrifying here to see the mass numbers of that many, dangerous creatures. The problem though is that they're decaying people. They shouldn't be able to run. It loses some realism in that fact for me. I still like the tension that comes from these ones, but I prefer the slow-moving, more traditional zombies.Since I'm talking about the creatures, I'll go next to the effects. I think that all of the practical effects are good here. The make up of the zombies is good. I like what they do with the headshots and the blood that comes from it. Back in the day I watched the featurette on the DVD for it which I found interesting. They do well with having a bit of hair and scalp move at times to help as well. The CGI really doesn't hold up for me. It isn't as much as you'd expect from a Zack Snyder film, but it is still there. Plus there is just an odd filter everything is through that I've come to notice with him as well. I think some of this comes from his use of green screen if I remember correctly.To take this next to the acting, which I think is really good. Polley is solid as our lead. I used to have a bit of a crush on her, but that really isn't there anymore. She doesn't add a lot to her character. She does fit just fine. Rhames is good as that brooding, imposing guy with an attitude for sure. I like Weber. Phifer is fine. Burrell cracks me up in his role as this rich jerk. I also really like Kelly. Aside from that, Zegers, Barry, Booth, Banks and Frewer are all fine in my opinion.The last thing to go over would be the soundtrack. The normal selections for the movie I thought fit well. They help to accent the scenes. What I really wanted to talk about though are some of the other songs. There is the Johnny Cash song of 'When the Man Comes Around', Richard Cheese doing 'Down with the Sickness', Disturbed's version over the credits and some other sprinkled in there. I really like all of these and it makes me think of this movie for most of them.So now with that said, this is one that I was really high on at first and have cooled quite a bit on it. There was a stretch where I even thought I might start to hate it. That isn't the case though. This is a good movie in my opinion. It takes the hurt of the original and does its own spin on it. Not everything works for me, but I do think the acting is good on the whole. The practical effects are as well and the soundtrack really works for me. Some of the CGI doesn't and I'm not the biggest fan of the running zombies if I'm honest. Regardless, it is a fun popcorn take on a classic story.",Dawn of the Dead
81,onepotato2,"comme ci, comme ca",4,2 January 2005,"Generally I liked this movie better when it was called ""ALIENS!""This is roughly on a par with 28 Days Later which had a stupid 2nd act. This Dawn has its scares but I really hate cheap shots, and I get very tired of scripts in which people in new, possibly dangerous surroundings, split up (!?) to investigate individually. (say... that's been a terrific idea for decades!) Sadly, it's the whole cast is filled with dumb characters. A girl who traverses a crowd of thousands of zombies to save a dog. Sarah Polly witnesses how fast her husband transforms but can't figure out the bite is the problem? What's up with depicting the playboy as a snide gay guy? They're two different things! I never believed he liked chicks for minute. Just kill them all, NOW!People who are offended by the changes in the remake should 1) explain why a remake should be remade if nothing is rethought? If there's not new riffs to play with, why remake a movie? Did the shot by shot remake of Psycho earn your praise? 2) They should also view the 1978 flick again. I had such strong memories of that film that I thought a remake was a dumb idea. After renting it again, it's comically dated, with bad acting and effects. Remakes will occur - Accept reality.",Dawn of the Dead
82,aimless-46,Lions and Tigers and Emmitt Smiths-Oh My!!!,6,21 March 2005,"Unlike my reaction to most remakes, I was happy when I first heard that they were remaking ""Dawn of the Dead"", the story is so irresistible that it could be remade ten times and each would still be entertaining. And I was sure they could do a whole lot better than George Romaro's third installment, the awful ""Day of the Dead"". Seeing the remake did not change my opinion, I found it fun entertainment and better than ""Day"". But I am hoping for still another remake because while better than ""Day"", it was not even remotely in the class of ""Night"" or the first ""Dawn"". It was about on a par with ""Return of the Living Dead"". Hopefully Romaro's new ""Land of the Living Dead"" will be a worthy companion to ""Night"" and to the original ""Dawn""..The remake started out well and it worked fine as long as Sarah Polley was the central character, but once they got into the mall the wheels fell off and the whole thing became very ordinary. And I was stunned by how bad the editing was with jump cuts and puzzling gaps in the storyline. While these may have been due to production issues, the lazy hack job done on titles and credits makes the post-production folks the most likely suspects.The biggest controversy is a shuffling zombie vs a running zombie. A single shuffling Romero zombie was not particularly dangerous and it was only a crowd of zombies that posed much of a threat. So having a running zombie helped to close the main plot hole in Romero's films-it never made sense that something that slow and stupid could have taken over. But a shuffler is a far more frightening image because zombies are about entropy, a symbol of individual humans and eventually the entire human order breaking down. Slow rot that eats away everything human in everyone else until it devours you alive. Barely ambulatory supports this fear far better than zombies that run like Emmitt Smith.I did generally enjoy this movie. But the comments on IMDb are far too often of the ""best ever"" ""worst ever"" type; useless to the prospective viewer. So for the benefit of those viewers I will again say that while the remake doesn't suck, it is extremely flawed and is only a pale shadow of the original. It is silly for us to accept that something this imperfect is anywhere near the best that can be expected from modern horror-especially since the illogic of such a belief is exposed by many classic horror movies, which create better horror and more suspense in subtle ways that does not need to overwhelm us to throughly scare us. So if someone calls this effort a classic, you can safely assume that they have not seen much else that the genre has to offer, or that they are as brain-dead as a zombie (but maybe not as brain-dead as those, and there are some out there, who thought ""Day of the Dead"" was the best of Romaro's trilogy).",Dawn of the Dead
83,Kamurai25,"""Let's Go To the Mall!""",9,23 July 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend.Granted, if you're not a zombie fan, you're probably not even considering this one. Then you have the great argument about infection vectors (this is pretty classic, bite infection transfer), and slow vs fast (this movie is fast) zombies. I'm basically just pointing out why we can't have nice things, people argue about it.This has a great cast: Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley and Jake Weber in particular. The production value was definitely present, and not just in renting a mall to trash, or even just the zombie practical effects.The large scale scenes look amazing, and the details on the various infections are fascinating to watch. And sure, there is lots of quality gunfire (foley is good) and shooting zombies for people you are just in it for the action. While it's actually got some good (if dark at times) humor to it, it's not ""Warm Bodies"".Of course the presence of zombies / apocalyptic situation / lack of central authority gives us great philosophical opportunity to discuss what life means and see how people behave, but this leans more towards survival strategy aspects.If anything, I think that is where the ""flaw"" is in this movie: (most of) the characters are relatively competent so it detours some from typical movie formula relying on the characters to make mistakes to progress the story, but more of there is just a hopeless unending storm of bad things happening to them, it's honestly a little refreshing.This is probably one of my favorite zombie movies, and I don't even like running zombies.",Dawn of the Dead
84,Rob_Taylor,Wow! A remake worthy of the original!,8,29 August 2004,"Yep, it is rare that remakes do much for me. Usually they're crappily done rehashes that lose all of the original's charm and messages (if any). Either that, or they ""re-imagine"" the original (God, I hate that term!) and muck the original about so much that you wonder why they gave it the same name (eg. Battlestar Galactica)But in DoD we get a movie that, like the original, is full of dark humour and menace, updated for today's audience. The original Romero version was good, and remains one of my favourites of all time. But this remake can stand proudly alongside it without feeling inferior in any way.The plot is virtually the same. People fleeing from zombies hold up inside a mall and try to wait out the apocalypse. This version has a whole lot more characters, although I'm giving nothing away by saying most of them die, and a few new ideas thrown in.The zombies owe more to Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" than they do to Romero's shambling originals. But that serves only to make them more menacing, since you can't necessarily outrun/outmaneuver them easily.The characters are reasonably stereotypical. But it is nice to see a movie where the heroes have ordinary jobs and aren't all ex-Green Berets or Navy Seals. Just average Joes and Janes. In fact, the most competent (in this kind of situation) individuals are a cop and some security guards, and none of them are eager to take charge (except one of the security guys, and he's messed up).There isn't a huge amount of character development. In fact, the aforementioned security guard undergoes the biggest development, losing his selfish attitude and becoming one of the more likable characters of the group.Needless to say, the group diminishes in size as the film progresses, lost to the zombies mostly, though with the occasional accident thrown in for good measure.There are a few things to mar this film. If you were trapped in a gun shop and had thousands of rounds of ammunition, wouldn't you just kill as many zombies from the rooftop as you could? What would be the point in not shooting them? Similarly, when using gas containers as bombs to be shot at as they lie on the ground, why not tape thousands of nails and screws to them and make them even more dangerous? But these are minor gripes more concerned with what I would do in that situation, rather than actual movie problems. In fact, most of the characters act with far more intelligence than you are used to seeing in a horror film, which in itself is a refreshing change.But, on the whole, this film scores highly for entertainment and rewatchability. There's plenty of gore to keep the splatter fans happy and plenty of fear for the easily frightened to bite their fingernails at. Likewise lots of ""Yeah!"" moments to cheer at.Easily the best movie I've watched this year.",Dawn of the Dead
85,lewiskendell,The way zombie movies should be done.,7,15 March 2011,"I'll always associate the Dawn of the Dead remake with my freshman year in college. Myself and a few of my friends had a great time in the theater watching it, and checking it out again a few years later, it's still a fun time. I credit it and 28 Days Later for really bringing the zombie movie back in an awesome way. Dawn of the Dead does almost everything right. There are some really horrifying events, plenty of scares, a good cast of characters played by capable actors, lots of action, a few moments of levity, and tons of zombie mayhem. It avoids the overwhelming deluge of heavy-handed social commentary that so many zombie movies drown in (Land of the Dead, anyone?), but it's also not just a completely shallow experience. You can't really go wrong with Dawn of the Dead if you're even slightly a fan of the genre. It starts with a bang from the very beginning, and rarely lets up the intensity. See it.",Dawn of the Dead
86,slayrrr666,"Better than expected, but not the original",9,23 April 2004,"`Dawn of the Dead' remake is a great horror film, but it is not all that great as a zombie film.**SPOILERS**During a grueling hospital shift, Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) returns home to her husband. In the morning, she awakes to discover her neighbor has a horrible rash on her face. The neighbor immediately attacks her husband, forcing Ana to restrain her. In the confrontation, her husband dies. As Ana tries to contact medical authorities, her husband comes back to life and attackers Ana as well, fleeing her neighborhood, Ana realizes her whole city is being ravaged by an unknown source. On the run, she meets up with cop Kenneth (Ving Rhames) who tries to get her to safety. While searching for safety, they meet another cop, Andre (Mekhi Phifer) who is transporting his wife to safety. They find another man, Michael (Jake Weber) and together they find shelter in Monroeville Mall. Knowing of the sanctuary it provides, and the three guards trusted to maintain its security, Bart (Michael Barry), CJ (Michael Kelley) and Terry (Kevin Zegers), they reluctantly accept the group inside. After a few nights together, they earn each other's trust and begin to formulate escape plans. All are shot down by the unknown enemy that lurks outside the mall. Finally realizing it is a zombie threat, they begin to realize they are all that is left of society. Then comes a strange delivery truck which drops off several people at the mall. At first, Bart and CJ don't trust them and order them away. Terry disagrees, and switches sides to help the wounded. They realize too late that those bitten become zombies, as several of the people were bitten. After ridding, the problems, they try a last chance to escape. Steve (Ty Burrell) one of the people from the delivery truck, has a boat that could get them out of the mall. Figuring it's worth a shot, they rig buses from the storage lot from downstairs into almost impenetrable masses of destruction, and set out to the dock where it's kept. Along the way, several more meet grisly ends at the hands of the zombies. Ana reveals she too is infected and will become a zombie, so she stays behind as Kenneth, Michael, Terry, and his girlfriend escape from civilization.The Good News: This film has an unbelievable opening and closing. The opening is perhaps one of the best scenes filmed in years. It is pretty close to the original, with its intense atmosphere, unreal images, and heart-stopping pace. It grabs you and never lets go, giving you almost no chance to rest in between. The ending is also a great scene, with complete irony toward the entire movie, while leaving a sequel in the works. The rest of the movie does have its fair share of good scenes. The zombie attack on the garage is tense and gripping, leaving the mall and entering a teeming zombie mass and still escaping is a breath-taking highlight, and the part with the sharpshooter picking off zombies is pretty funny. All in all, there are plenty of parts to give it a wonderful tone. The number of scares is small compared to, say, `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' but those it provides are especially powerful. The opening is very nerve-wracking, but it still plays perfectly with the rest of the film. The performances are quite good, with the three leads Rhames, Polley, and Weber turning in solid outings. As expected, a ton of gore is found, but only in the beginning and end of the movie. The end is pretty gruesome, with its escape from the mall, not the escape from society/ closing credit sequence. The middle of the film does have some good gore scenes, but it seems awfully watered down. A pack of zombies drag a man down and swarm over him, but then nothing is seen. A gripe I'll mention in the next part. The Bad News: I don't know if it was played for comedy or what, but the stupidity of several characters was irritating. After knowing that zombies can't talk, Bart refuses to let Kenneth and gang stay because he suspects they may be zombies. A small part where from one side, Kenneth and group peer out into the zombie mass and pick out zombies that look like celebrities. The sharpshooter across the street picks them off, and they mention one that looks like Rosie O'Donnell. After knowing that zombies won't attack a dog, they release it into the mass to go across the street to deliver food to the starving person. When he gets bitten, one of them rushes across the street, teeming with zombies, to rescue the dog. Also, why was there a scene where the characters have a long, civilized dinner? This happens in the middle of the movie, and I was confused why it was shown. Stupidity than rationality was common in this movie. Again, no explanation is offered for the zombies appearance, which is particularly annoying know. I don't care if they give an illogical reason for them to be there, as the Italians do. Any reason is better than no reason. Also, despite the high gore opening and ending, almost nothing in the middle of the film. I don't know if it was censored or what, but I expected a movie about flesh-eating zombies to be teeming with gore. Speaking of flesh-eating zombies, they were given little screen time. A few scattered scenes in the middle are all we see of them after the opening and ending. I expected more zombies, despite the fact that they were now the fast-moving kind. Since it was in a mall, the mall didn't seem that big or expansive, and it lacked an all-out zombie-vs.-Man encounter. The Final Verdict: See this only if you love zombie movies or modern horror movies. It will not disappoint anyone.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a short sex scene, and animals in peril.",Dawn of the Dead
87,screenman,Yet More Zombies!,7,9 April 2012,"By now (2012) I've grown pretty weary of flesh-eating zombie types. They've become a whole genre to themselves. From the endless 'Resident Evil' to Big-Ears' 'I am Legend' on to the no less eternal 'Walking Dead' TV serial-thon. Why do they have to eat flesh all the time anyway? It's clear that they don't actually need it because they can go for weeks without so much as a nibble. Why can't they have a positive fixation like painting & decorating or flower arrangement?Well, this 2004 remake takes Romero's original and gives the cadaverous ones an Olympian turn of speed. The result is much more dramatic. Chases are truly hectic and confrontations are more in keeping with werewolves or Aliens. The movie takes a pretty dystopian view about the consequences of social breakdown. There's very little heroic stiff-upper-lip stuff and a lot more looking out for number one. Against such dire consequences, it's probably much nearer the mark. It's one thing to go to the guillotine for someone, but quite another to be eaten alive or changed into one of them yourself. Methinks Sidney Carton would take a raincheck here.Most of the takes are pretty solidly put together. Looks like the directors hired a genuine shopping-mall for the weekend. There's lots of believable conflict between the survivors and plenty of extremely tense action sequences when zombies turn up, fast, furious and very ravenous. Editing is sharp and well observed. Lighting & sound do the business. There's no happy ending.Character development is more detailed than the usual slash & gnash offerings. Most of the dumb things people do are plausible, even though I often found myself saying 'oh-no; you don't want to do that' or 'why don't you try this?' At least I was drawn into their dilemma. But having said as much; I wasn't particularly inclined to empathise with any of them either, which left the story with a shallow texture.Altogether it's a decent watch. Certainly I would recommend a viewing. It's at the top end of the zombie market, for what that's worth.",Dawn of the Dead

Also a healthy dose of satire on religion.I come to praise. But there is a mystery - the director and writer joined the Hollywood clown show after this, so how did they come up with such brilliance in the first place?

As a result, what we see here is a mish-mash of all clichés possible, and every time you watch some certain scene, you scratch your head as if trying to recollect whether you've seen this already in many more such like movies, and you'll be right. We have seen this all before many times, and we are not impressed. One good thing did come out of that, though - Shaun Of The Dead, that hilarious parody film with great Simon Pegg as a lead. They parodied all the key moments of Dawn, with all those inevitable and highly predictable moments. Any redeeming feature in This flick? Maybe, the very beginning, with the family breakdown and initial panic spread out. All the rest is a yawning fest with all the hugely exaggerated scenes of cartoonish violence and long, slow talks.

94,KUAlum26,"Solid film, whether you like horror movies or not",8,10 February 2005,"I just saw this one yesterday on video. I must first off confess that I haven't seen the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" except for brief clips(which really shouldn't count). I must say I was impressed.I will also cop to the fact that I am not ordinarily a horror film fan. That isn't to say I haven't seen my fair share of scary flicks be it cheesy and formulaic(i.e. most of the Friday the 13th series,the first ""Poltergeist for examples) or classic(""Psycho"",""Carrie"",""NIght of the Living Dead"" come to mind),but I don't think I could call myself an aficionado of the genre. Having said that,I would recommend this film to either horror buffs and even non-buffs,but the latter on one condition:that you have a high tolerance for gore.By now,you know the scenario:a group of basically ordinary people hide out at a mall,trying to stay safe and stave off a seemingly endless waves of flesh and brain-eating undead. Naturally,a level of claustrophobia envelops the group and it becomes as much a psychological drama as it is an emotional thriller. For all you uber violence fans out there,there's plenty of killing,crashing and explosions to keep you sated. Ving Rhames and JAke Webber really stand out among the survivors here,though I gotta give credit to Sarah Polley for adding a level of thoughtful dignity to her character in a film type she's not ordinarily associated with. A mostly obscure cast(that seems predominantly Canadian!hmmmmn) fills out this cast,exceptions being Mekhi Pfeifer and Matt Frewer(Max Headroom,anyone?). The makeup effects for the zombies are strangely showcased in full in only two parts of the movie: the very beginning and toward the end. The credits were probably consisting of mostly fx,makeup,pyrotech,stunts and cameras.No surprise there really,and they do their jobs superbly!To those who want to see a wild,explosive action/horror hybrid of a film,I recommend it. 8 out of 10 stars.",Dawn of the Dead
95,oneguyrambling,Zack Snyder's first - and so far best - film,9,27 November 2010,"So the neighbour's kid comes into your bedroom in the early am, snarling a little more than an 8 year old should, should you be worried?In fairness she did seem to be missing most of a lip, that's bound to create some sort of speech impediment. So poor Louis leans in just far enough to leave his neck exposed and...Louis predictably enough (for a zombie movie) sparks up a little after death, and immediately takes a different interest in Ana, deciding that some shower action might be appropriate, only this time rip your living flesh from your body action.Ana decides that enough of this relationship and kicks Louis to the kerb by jumping out the window and driving off, once outside she realizes that she isn't in Kansas anymore. At least I don't think this was filmed in Kansas, what do I know I'm not American.Outside everything is in chaos, there are some awesome visuals in these first moments of realization, including a massive fuel station crash that still has impact even when you've seen the film half a dozen times like me.Ana eventually reverses her car off an embankment and her lights go out...And that's when the opening credits roll! Fast forward a little, Ana is now back on her feet, and she meets with other survivors, each with their own grim tales to tell. They all decide to head to the relative safety of the local mall. The initial crew are Ana, cop Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Michael (Jake Weber), and a pregnant couple.Once in the mall their initial impediment comes in the form of some dipsh*t security guards who have decided that allowing others in will somehow compromise their own safety, this all changes when a new batch of survivors shows up and joins the party.The new group of about 8 (from memory) include 2 wounded, obviously the gang haven't seen a zombie movie before so they don't see what's coming until it gets there.Another new development is the sighting of another survivor across the road from the mall in a gunshop, after conversing by hand held whiteboard and binoculars they discover that the man's name is Andy, and that he is alone. Even though he is almost within shouting distance however, the sea of zombies in between makes it nigh impossible to simply catch up for a beer.It is obvious that even though some are better equipped to handle the situation than others, there is no Arnie style hero among them that will single-handedly ward off the zombie hordes, nor a super-genius character who can devise an amazing cure (Pontypool?) or amazing escape. It is simply a bunch of random people thrust together through amazingly unfortunate events.Most notable among the group though are two guys who couldn't be more dissimilar, Michael is loyal, quiet and sensible and extremely determined despite his background not suggesting any heroism,""I sell TVs at Best Buy"". His antithesis is Steve, a smarmy, self-absorbed prick of a man who wants no part in anything even vaguely dangerous and is more than content sitting at the back of the room and throwing jibes around without ever being the least bit helpful.Steve is a total w*nker but provides most of the funny in the film, so much so that I didn't actually want him to get what he really deserved, and Michael was so resourceful and selfless that you want him to make it out too, but for the opposite reasons. It's rare that a horror film takes the time to actually highlight the various personalities of the characters to an extent greater than ""the hero"", ""the nerd"", ""the hot chick"" and ""the evil guy who will die horribly"".The ongoing discussions invariably return to the outside world; are there unaffected ""safe"" areas?; are there even other survivors?; and the overriding question remains should they stay in relative security or leave and see for themselves what is ""out there""? Without spoilers, eventually the decision is sort of made for them, and the final 15 or so minutes is nothing short of awesome. The film has some amazing action sequences, some great gore effects and things move at a frantic pace. Say what you want about running zombies but in my view it is scarier to be chased by a foaming and spitting zombie that can do the 40 yard dash in a few seconds than a shuffling mummy-style thing. Obviously the zombies had the good sense to keep up their cardio, even in death.For those who say that the dead can't run. They can't shuffle or walk either f*ckers! The film has a couple of amusing bits, but even in the face of zombie apocalypse it is fair to expect someone to crack a joke every now and then. In the main though it holds true to the tone set in the early going, escaping a flesh-hungry menace can bring you down just a little.There is never a reason given for the outbreak in zombie-it is, and I maintain that if the movie is good then there doesn't ever need to be.And this movie is verrrrry good.When I originally watched it 6 or so years ago I remember thinking ""that couldn't have been that good could it?"" and I watched it again the next night. I was amazed to find that even after the second viewing I was just as blown away.Final Rating - 9 / 10. Proof that remakes don't have to be simply lazy cash-cows. This is ferocious, adrenaline fuelled and original in its own way. Even though this is not particularly scary it is still a modern horror classic, and should form part of any discerning horror fan's DVD collection.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Dawn of the Dead
96,Cosmoeticadotcom,Mediocre,5,10 September 2008,"OK, so the 2004 Zack Snyder remake of George Romero's Dawn Of The Dead is better than his own fourth Dead movie, Land Of The Dead, but it's still not nearly as good as the original 1978 Dawn Of The Dead. The basic problem is that the film violates its own universe's rules so many times that the film falls apart narratively. One can get away with things that are illogical in real life, but not according to the film's own precepts. In contrast to the Romero canon, zombies in this film can run like Olympic sprinters. Why? No reason except the financial success of the British zombie film 28 Days. Also, in the Romero canon, anyone who dies becomes a zombie, whereas in this film you are zombified only by a bite. Yet, if so, how did the first zombie, Zombie Zero, come to be?That said, this film is not bad, merely a solid action/horror flick that follows the same general pattern as the original Dawn Of The Dead, except that instead of four survivors in a mall there are a dozen or so. Illogic rules, as in all horror and sci fi films, and the plot is propelled by the characters doing the dumbest things possible, such as the climactic scene where they make a dash from the mall to a marina to head for an island they think will be safe haven. For fans of the Romero canons there are a few cool cameos by Tom Savini (Romero's original makeup man), and Scott Reiniger and Ken Foree, from the original Dawn Of The Dead, with Reiniger as a military man interviewed on television, and Foree as a televangelist repeating his famed declamation from the original, 'When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.' This, and a bevy of other little 'moments', is enough for me to recommend the film as a solid reinterpretation of the superior original, despite its reliance on the 'humans are their own worst enemies' mantra, although the DVD features make this a much stronger recommendation for those zombiephiles out there.",Dawn of the Dead
97,BrandtSponseller,"As good as the original, with exciting new directions and room for a sequel!",10,18 February 2005,"Shortly after a number of strange cases begin to appear at the hospital where Ana (Sarah Polley) works, a bizarre zombie ""epidemic"" hits the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area full force. Sarah escapes her immediate threats and meets a number of other humans who decide to seek shelter inside a large shopping mall. As they learn that the zombie outbreak is much more widespread than anyone could have imagined, their chances of survival grow increasingly dim.I know an awful lot of genre fans rail against remakes, but like the update of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), this version of Dawn of the Dead is so good that we should instead be clamoring for more.Writer James Gunn and director Zack Snyder knew that they had to come into the remake with both barrels blasting. Hardly five minutes into the film we're already into hardcore, high tension, gore-filled horror material. In lesser films, our introduction to full-fledged zombie activity would have been dream material as a kind of teaser. Gunn and Snyder dispense with such weak-willed tactics and immediately launch into Armageddon. We quickly move to a wide shot of explosions, brutal car crashes and other mayhem.We do finally get a breather while we're learning our cast of characters at the mall in nicely written scenes that bring out personality and depth to the relatively large cast, but horror fanatics need not fret that the film will evolve into a drama--tension and gore are never far removed from the film.Gunn and Snyder earn credit for both paying homage to their source material and taking off into other interesting directions. This remake is just as intense and titillating as Romeo's original, but with a different spin.The cast is excellent, the cinematography and editing exciting and innovative, and the makeup and ""creature"" effects are top notch.Even though I've seen greater quantities, the DVD for Dawn of the Dead also has some of the best extras I've seen on a disc in terms of quality. You get two excellent short films that effectively extend the feature. In one, a new character from the remake, Andy (Bruce Bohne), who runs a gun shop across the street from the mall, gives us a 15-minute video diary of his last 15 days. It's similar in some ways to the feel of The Blair Witch Project (1999), but for my money, it's much better than that film. In the other, we get a 30-minute condensation of the news broadcasts following the outbreak of the zombie ""epidemic"". This also easily beats any mock horror documentary (such as The Last Broadcast (1998)) with its hands tied behind its back. Make sure you at least rent the DVD to check out these extras.",Dawn of the Dead

But I thoroughly enjoyed this film.Yes, I knew where the scary scenes were and anticipated it's arrival and found the whole 'If you get bit you turn into zombie' a little cheesy. But overall the movie had some good bits that kept it strong.I loved the scene when the guys have to turn on the power, very nail biting and exciting; as well as the construction of the vehicles and their run. The end was quite sad, but I guess that's what happens when the world becomes infested with the dead.For an idea that has been done countless times before, it was able to maintain some type of hold on its audience. And didn't spend ages on the discussion of how the dead are suddenly walking the earth and the zombie birth was quite startling.",Dawn of the Dead

100,MrGKB,Workmanlike re-imagining,6,21 August 2005,"(Edited from a post to IMDb ""DotD04"" BB, with DVD-release emendations in *asterisks*) In ""Dawn of the Dead (2004)"" Director Zack Snyder has crafted an interesting, though flawed, thrill ride of a film that cribs the scenario---a plague of the reborn dead intent upon devouring the living---and the shopping mall setting of George A. Romero's classic ""Dawn of the Dead (1978)"", and precious little else. Purist fans may be offended, but this reworking of Romero's consumerist satire is entertaining, if somewhat skimpy on substance; Snyder and screenwriter James Gunn have twisted elements of Romero's story to suit the needs of a revved-up, post-millennial audience. We get a child zombie, but this time right up front and gruesomely disfigured to boot. We get a ""Steve"" to love to hate, but he's not a lead. We get the mall, but it's not as much a haven to be secured as an insecure prison. There's no biker gang breaking in; our heroes are instead forced to break out. The zombies are as hyper as Mikey on four bowls of Life cereal, but just as appropriately gruesome and scary as their cousins doing the Romero shuffle. We get a dose of homage, including a Gaylen Ross storefront and a CGI-flyby of the WGON helicopter. We get Max Headroom as a guy who looks like the original Roger and dies like him, but without the ""I'm going to try...not to come back!"" along with the original Roger as a haggard general, Ken Foree reworking his classic tag line, ""When there's no more room in hell"" and Tom Savini chewing scenery as a sheriff. We get a spectacular exploding head, but it pops near the end of the film, and it happens to someone we like. We get an unsettling ""happy"" ending, which is then tagged with a deliberately confusing ""unhappy"" postscript mixed into the credit reel.What we don't get is much in the way of character development, and next to nothing of Romero's wry social commentary, unless one takes the underlying nihilism of the film to be thoughtful insight. Snyder's inspired opening and title sequences paint an uncompromising nightmare of civil disorder and a failure of authority to deal with crisis. Medical personnel are more dangerous than useful: a doctor shows more interest in golf than an unusual bite case, an ambulance runs down Ana's neighbor. Bus drivers are potential carjackers, the first cop Ana meets points a shotgun in her face, and later, security guards offer anything but. The military tucks its tail into a helicopter and runs, while the broadcast media seem to collapse overnight. Our band of survivors is left to its own devices, and the film's zeitgeist is very much every man for himself. Or as Kenneth says, ""F*** y'all."" The film leaves more questions open than it grudgingly answers. Some are immaterial (how did the zombie plague originate?), some are niggling irritations (why wasn't Vivian as aggressive as the other zombies? Why do zombies possess the vocal cords of wild animals?), and some are whimsical (why kill a baby zombie; what's it going to do, gum you to death?), but some are crucial to the internal logic of the story. How did Andy die and do the zombie two-step so fast? *This is explained in the DVD release in a short ""home-video"" as a combination of weakness from starvation and bad luck* Why did Luda take so long to die, compared to the fat lady in the wheelbarrow? Why did the bite victims in Ana's hospital take so long? Where were the zombie children and teenagers? Where were all the other dogs, and why wouldn't zombies eat them? How did Ana and her husband manage to remain unaware of the growing chaos outside their house? Big question: why, once they were secure within the cornucopia of the mall, didn't our protagonists exploit those resources? Why didn't they dress protectively? Why didn't they improvise more weapons, especially flammable ones? Why didn't they scrounge up a short wave radio, or try to access the Internet? *Andy apparently web surfs in his home video, but this avenue is quickly squelched* Why didn't Snyder and Gunn put a little more thought into their story?Fast zombies are a chilling variation, but they defy the laws of physiology for the sake of frenetic film-making. Snyder and Gunn have catered to the eMpTyV, short-attention-span crowd and jazzed-up Romero's much more disturbing shamblers, if not for the sake of hectic-editing junkies, then as justification for the swift spread of zombie infestation. One can only guess how Andy barricaded his shop so quickly. *Even the home video ignores this* Fast zombies (or ""zoombies,"" as one inspired IMDb BB writer dubbed them) surely expend more energy than slow ones; flesh and bone breaks down without refueling, and corpses don't have much in the way of fresh oxygen and nutrients. Eyes cloud when fluids dry up. Joints stiffen; internal organs shrivel. Suspension of disbelief falls by the wayside.Despite its plot flaws and questionable character development *some of which is mended in the DVD director's cut*, I enjoyed this reworking of Romero's seminal classic. Some of the visual effects were less than convincing, but the make-up was effective, the acting was commendable, the overall apocalyptic vision was well-realized, and the storytelling was well-paced, if problematic. I enjoyed revisiting the delicious horrors of zombie invasion, but---and it may simply be because I am now a quarter century older and that much more jaded---""Dawn'04"" didn't give me nightmares like the original did. If I had to pick one of the two for a desert island DVD collection, it would have to be Romero's inspired, shoestring-budget masterpiece over Snyder's pricier, workmanlike debut any day of the dead, pun fully intended. Still, I give ""Dawn'04"" a 6 out of 10; it's nearly as frenetic as the zombies with which it's populated, but just as empty-headed as well.",Dawn of the Dead
101,CitizenCaine,When There's No More Room In Hell...,7,1 May 2004,"The dead will walk the Earth...over my dead body! Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Mekhi Phifer lead the cast in this re-imagining of George A. Romero's horror classic: Dawn Of The Dead. I say re-imagining; because, any attempt to classify this film as a remake would be inaccurate. Aside from cameos by original ""Dead"" actors, a few in-jokes related to the original ""Dead"", the shopping mall setting, and the title, this film is its own entity. After an intense beginning full of horrifying images, the film settles into ""introduce the motley band of characters"" mode. A nurse, police officer, young interracial couple, mall security with little men syndrome, and a few others are thrown together in order to build up the zombie fodder numbers. We don't really know who is going to get it next or why. The film is absent of the social commentary that Romero's film contained, but there's a terrific scenario involving a rooftop sniper trying to survive that reduces normal human beings to mindless, non-discriminating perpetrators of equally bloodthirsty violence. I doubt whether the writer or director intended this scenario to have any effect beyond the comical one it had. The film contains a few other welcome scenes of grotesque humor as well, mostly in the middle third of the film. The film picks up again when the survivors decide that they must flee before becoming zombie stew. The film contains several extremely intense scenes of graphic gore and violence in the last third of it. It seems like nearly every object becomes a potential weapon in this film besides the wide assortment of guns and ammunition: An ax, a croquet mallet, and the horror film staple, a chainsaw. The film is supposedly set in a fictional town near Milwaukee, but it was obviously filmed elsewhere. Aside from the Wisconsin license plate on a car in the early part of the movie and a media news brief, there is nothing else that I saw that places the film in Wisconsin. Most of the movie was actually made in the Canadian substitute for the Midwest these days: Ontario. The film bears more than a passing resemblance to the recent 28 Days Later, but it stands on its own merits. There are too sudden character transformations and a few plot holes, like how did they know which boat to run to near the end? However, this film will satisfy most horror fans out there. Stay tuned through the closing credits. *** of 4 stars.",Dawn of the Dead

103,KnightsofNi11,Zombies- 1 Story/plot/characters- 0,5,12 September 2012,"Zack Snyder's directorial debut tackles the remake of George A. Romero's 1978 zombie classic, Dawn of the Dead. While Romero's original was a slow moving suspense filled gore fest, Snyder's version is just a gore fest. In this remake the zombies no longer shuffle about aimlessly. Now, they are feral creatures that will run at you as fast as they can, snarling horrendously the whole time. The film follows a group of people, including a nurse and a cop, as they make their way to a mall where they plan to hold up until this apocalypse blows over, or something like that. Of course, the calm and peace is short lived before hordes of the undead start making their way to the mall, forcing the survivors to find a way to escape this hellish nightmare.Zack Snyder is honestly the only thing that makes this film watchable. If not for his wicked visual stylization we would be left with an utterly silly film full of characters we can't wait to watch die. This is a plot hole ridden film where the characters actions don't seem to be backed by any logic or reasoning. These moments of total stupidity range from laughably bad to frustratingly moronic that you just want to punch something. Needless to say, we would all be screwed if we wound up with these people during the zombie apocalypse.That being said, if you like zombies and you like copious and almost over-the-top amounts of gore then it's hard not to enjoy Dawn of the Dead. It's so intense, so brutal, and so non stop that you really sort of become enthralled in the graphic events unfolding before your eyes. If you watched Dawn of the Dead when it first came out in 2004, chances are you suspected this Zack Snyder guy to be someone worth keeping up with. And of course, he was worth keeping up with because everything he has done since this debut has been an improvement of his style and eye for sick visuals.With a story that actually made sense all the way through and characters that we could actually sympathize with, Dawn of the Dead actually could have been really good. But its plot really drags it down tirelessly, and all we are left with is cool zombie action, and that isn't quite enough to save this film from being pretty bad.",Dawn of the Dead
104,Holt344,"Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead is a worthy remake of the original, making it scarier and gorier - a great zombie film",9,2 November 2021,"I'm going back to Zack Snyder's first film for a second viewing, I found the film to be a solid 7.5 back then and my opinion have changed to a small degree, I think it's better than that. With a lot more knowledge of both the zombie genre and Zack Snyder's filmography, I still think George Romero's original Dawn of the Dead is better but Zack Snyder created a worthy addition to the zombie genre and a remake true to the source material. James Gunn's screenplay is fantastic. With producers Eric Newman and Marc Abraham along, they knew exactly what they were doing and it worked well. With a well written script by James Gunn, the original's basic premise is instead oriented around the action genre and Snyder helped keeping every aspect of the production as grounded in reality as possible with help of the producers and Gunn. But this is the first time I've watched the director's cut of the film and it isn't that different, just more character development and more zombie gore. But the theatrical cut is still terrific, this version just adds on that brilliance.Set in Milwaukee, Dawn of the Dead follows a group of lone survivors who take refuge in an upscale suburban shopping mall during a zombie apocalypse. The survivors are mostly normal civilians like a nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman and other survivors. The cast has actors like Sarah Polley as Ana Clark, Ving Rhames as Sergeant Kenneth Rhodes, Jake Weber as Michael Shaunessy, Ty Burrell as Steve Markus and Michael Kelly as C. J, along with a couple of others.Many years went by before my first viewing and my second, still, I remember so many scenes. Zack Snyder have created a zombie film that you'll remember for many years to come as that's my experience. It's also a great remake or reimagining of the original film, I still think George Romero's Dawn of the Dead is better with its message and just being one of the best zombie films. Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead has great cinematography and Is visually a good looking movie. The pacing is perfect, with non stop action and suspension, makes for a film that will get your heart pumping. The choice of making the zombies able to run and smarter, makes for more a horror experience and honestly I was scared countless of times on my first viewing when I was new to the genre. Both the sound design and musical score plus soundtrack was brilliant. The special makeup effects for the film were created by Oscar winner David LeRoy Anderson and I have to admit, the work he does for this film is award worthy.Critics have said that this is Zack Snyder's best film and I don't really agree, but it's easily among his top five. I see that now. But I think it would have been even better if it was longer as it would have meant more character development but could easily made the pacing worse. The people behind this production and especially the director and writer wanted to make a grounded and suspenseful zombie film and they created one of the best zombie films out there, a flawed zombiefied masterpiece.",Dawn of the Dead
105,jluis1984,Almost as good as the original!,8,28 December 2005,"Young director Zack Snyder risked everything he had with this remake of George Romero's classic zombie movie, and he hit the jackpot. Snyder not only makes a movie that is as good as the original, he develops the story in a different direction and makes a movie that will be remembered as a classic on its own merit.The basic premise of Romero's original screenplay is here, a group of people uses a mall as a fortress during the outbreak of the zombie epidemic; nevertheless, Snyder takes a more action-oriented approach to the story focusing in the fight for survival, instead of the social cometary Romero always gives.While purists may call this a cheap change to make the movie more appealing, I believe that Snyder's work is really a good rework of the story. Sure, it is true that the fast action that the movie delivers gives few room to explore the characters the way Romero used to do, Snyder makes the whole trouble a bit more realistic, by pushing the claustrophobic tension to the limit.The acting is for the most part very good, and while the characters are not really very well developed, the performances of the cast really make up for it.A single expression of Ving Rhames says more than a thousand lines of script. He is truly an underrated actor. Sarah Polley and Jake Weber are very convincing as unlikely survivors of this apocalypse and while not as good as Rhames, both of them have very good chemistry.The SFX are very good, frightening and convincing, and to add my two cents to the famous debate about the ""running zombies"", I think that they work very good in the context of the movie and serve the purpose that Snyder had in mind.Sadly, not everything is perfect, as certain subplots are somewhat absurd and out of place in the movie, also, the lack of development of the characters at times hurts the film, in the sense that one would like to know more about the characters and their motivations; nevertheless, it is fair to point out that there is more good than bad, and that the feeling after the movie is the one of entire satisfaction.The dawn of the Dead remake is a movie that lives up to the expectation, and respectfully follows the path of the original in its transformation into a genre classic by its own merit.8/10. Awesome debut for Snyder.",Dawn of the Dead

This is the only good movie Zack Snyder has ever done and I have been watching a lot this movie. I have it on Blu-ray disc and this film was really the first zombie film I saw before I purchase an watch the original film.The special effects were done by Heather Langenkamp from a Nightmare on Elm Street ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and New Nightmare. My favorite heroine Nancy Thompson did special effects for the zombies for this movie. This is my all time favorite zombie horror film that I have watch it more then once Ving Rhames is also good likable character much better then he was in Undisputed.A mysterious virus is bringing the dead back to life as vicious re-animated corpses that go fast and feed upon the living. One morning, a nurse (Sarah Polly) escapes from her house after her husband was turned into a zombie as she escapes on the road only to be later crashed without being killed.

Romero's masterpiece ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 1978 was going to be remade, i was really upset. I mean why mess with something that wasn't even broke in the first place? Then when i saw the trailer to it, i thought it might not be so bad. Afterall the original 1978 version is one of my favorite movies of all time, i did went to see this version in the theater and was pleasantly surprised of how well this was well made.This is a spectacular update of George A. Romero's classic and worked just like the 1990 remake to ""Night of the Living Dead"" , this movie offers great performances by the cast and marks the debut of visionary Zack Sydner who gave us ""300"" and the upcoming ""Watchmen"". this movie is loaded with action and over the top gore like exploding heads, implements and of course the zombies here are fast like in the tradition of ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Nightmare City"", ""Lifeforce"" or ""The Stuff"". Although it misses out on the excellent social satire that made the original the classic it was, but this is a brilliant and fun re-imagining that is a solid winner.Score A 9/10 I would have give it 10 but the original George A.

107,juliankennedy23,Isn't a good remake an oxymoron,9,8 May 2005,"Dawn of the Dead (2004): 10/10: I sympathize with the fan boys that feel any remake of Dawn of the Dead is religious sacrilegious. You get an emotional attachment to films that scared you in your youth. (One on mine is Assault on Precinct 13 that was remade recently and I just know I will be disappointed with the remake. I am still scared of ice cream trucks as a result of seeing that film when I was 9) Remakes themselves have a well deserved bad reputation. (Easiest movie trivia question: What is the best film remake? The Maltese Falcon of course. That Humphrey Bogart perennial was a remake of a 1931 film of the same name. I'm sure back in 1941 that there were a couple of people complaining that Bogart was no Ricardo Cortez and the ruined the story by taking out the affair and homosexual subplots. The first film after all was a pre-code affair.) Dawn of the Dead is in reality a different movie than the original. This is no shot for shot Psycho remake nor is it the same movie with a glossier CGI coat of paint. It is a faster more intense zombie film. It is one of the best action horror films of the last ten years. The opening twenty minutes in simply one of the scariest action packed sequences I have ever seen. By the time our band of protagonists gets to the mall they are not the only one's catching their breath. It becomes a pretty good sized group at the mall and you end up slogging through some slow bits as the zombies eat it down to a more manageable size.The acting is across the board good and the effects are suitably gory and plentiful. Director Zack Snyder wisely dumps much of Romero's sociological subplots and replaces them with a more timely commentary. (Instead of zombies as consumer motif we have shooting undead celebrities. And instead of an outwardly hostile motorcycle gang, we have a more subtle power struggle between the otherwise powerless.) The updates honestly work, as a more literal remake would have simply fallen flat. Is Dawn of the Dead better than the original? I won't say. Is it one of the best films of 2004? Yes. Is it better than Romero's own sequel Day of the Dead? Good Lord yes.",Dawn of the Dead
108,Squonkamatic,Decent Pop Culture Nihilism,7,24 April 2010,"If nothing else, the phenomenal popularity of Zack Snyder's 2004 re-visioning of DAWN OF THE DEAD is proof positive that deep down inside our contemporary youth culture is still as morose and titillated by carnage & destruction as mine was. I missed the frenzy of excitement + hype over this film at the time of release, too fully absorbed in my own fascination with European made horror from the 60s and 70s to be bothered with a modern day remake of anything by George A. Romero. A remake of his 1978 DAWN OF THE DEAD seemed especially futile since part of the reason why that movie worked is as a reaction against the tacky polyester disco suit pop culture of the Carter years. People whine about Bush but I had to live through Carter and trust me, it was worse, though after seeing it Snyder's remake I can say it is exactly the movie that the post 9/11 War On Terror era had coming. In spite of its grim source material the film manages to upbeat, exciting, engaging, and most of all fun. Go figure.Was Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD fun? Kind of, or rather its satire angle gave the mayhem a kick in the pants that was absent from so much of the similar material from the era. Much of it was genuinely hilarious within the context of the film like the priceless epic fail gag where the zombie rises up to attack only to have the top of its head lopped off by a helicopter blade. We had been waiting nearly 20 years to see something like that and at the time it brought down the house. But one of the reasons why Romero's DAWN worked so well is the plodding, relentless course of doom that focuses the film's central themes of the world having come to an end. Even an idyllic life in a fully stocked shopping mall won't cut it, with the primary underlying conflict in the film being providing the survivors with a reason to get the hell out of there.Snyder's remake does an admirable job of imparting that need before its survivors even get settled in for the long haul. I never felt at home in this mall, which was so impersonal and unaccommodating that even the toilets were fakes in the home decor shop the primaries are forced to bed down in. Then again the film never pauses to really let them get used to being there -- something the 1978 version went to great lengths to depict -- with the zombies existing almost as a Greek chorus to keep the plot moving along. Random new characters are inserted to up the body counts and provide emotional draws for the audience to identify with, including a cute dog put to work in the crux scene where the film starts to spiral out of control and they are finally forced to abandon the mall to the zombies.Who are more interested in chasing down the surviving humans en masse like they were storming a free Michael Jackson concert. Similar to the creatures in Umberto Lenzi's CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD the zombies are fast, deadly, and instinctively trained in hand to hand combat, a fringe benefit of being bitten & transformed. To hell with bombing Iran, we should set a horde of zombies loose on them and flood the airwaves with Johnny Cash songs. They'd go belly up inside of a week. The one complaint I had about the zombies was that fighting them off became a video game, complete with a sewer level where they lost the blue key while getting fresh ammo packs + quad damage. When the movie finally sputtered to an end all I could think was, What no Boss Monster? Which might come across as a criticism but then again this is the visual language that the target audience (10 to 40 year old tech savvy consumers) knows & speaks best. I was grateful Snyder spared us having to use cheat codes on a Thrall map.A subtle zombie movie wouldn't have been appropriate either, with the mold for the film's approach lying somewhere between the Italian horror epics and Dan O'Bannon's punk rock RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD. But unlike that film Snyder's remake retains an air of sobriety and grim seriousness that was strangely refreshing, and quite fitting for some of the 9/11 era images of urban destruction it depicted. There was one shot of a street littered with office paper that was right out of the WTC photo memorials, and Snyder's makeup crew did a marvelous job of creating their zombies by basing the imagery on autopsy photos. All of it felt quite real even if the primary focus of the cinematographers was to find white surfaces for brains to splatter on when a zombie got shot in the head. But hey, that comes with the territory.The film had two great contributions to zombie lore as well, first with Michael Kelly's superb character of C.J. the cynical security guard, and a zombie baby birth that like the head in the helicopter blade gag was exactly what we had been waiting another 20 years to see. Ving Rhames also created an excellent character with his gruff Officer Ken, and the film manages to maintain a level of mayhem throughout its length that is quite worthy of the traditions on which the movie drew (including a first rate quickie scene of a Presidential Guard detail gunning down a group of journalists who get to close: my kind of stuff!). All of it works pretty well though it is definitely more of a ""re-visioning"" of Romero's scenario rather than a remake. I guess they felt compelled to re-use the title as an homage because its a very different film, very well made and very worthy of being seen. Even if nobody actually gets eaten.7/10",Dawn of the Dead
109,rainking_es,Pure Entertainment...,7,2 September 2004,"OK, remakes haven't the same merit than the original thing and the most of the times are unnecessary and quite worst than the movie they're ""remaking"". However, there're exceptions to that rule, and Dawn Of The Dead (2004) is one of those. The starting point is the same as in George A. Romero's version: a group of people take refuge from the attack of the living dead in a shopping centre. But there're some differences that makes this remake much better and much frantic than the 1978's Dawn Of The Dead:1) It's not as long as the first version. Almost 40 minutes shorter.2) The living dead are fast as hell, which makes them much more terrorific.3) This movie is pure action, there's not a second's break.4) The use of digital cameras intensify the action scenes (especially to the of the movie)5) Obviously they've spent much more money than Romero did. Spending more money doesn't mean that you're gonna make a better film; but in this case it does. 6) There're no easy frights.7) (This may not be an advantage) Is not as darker an oppressive as the first version.Well, that's it. No pretensions but to make you have a funny-cary time. Zack Snyder definitely achieves that.My rate: 7/10",Dawn of the Dead
110,swilliky,Fast Zombies!!!! Great Remake,8,20 August 2015,"This movie and the 28 days and months, and maybe Zombieland, have the fast moving zombies, which are so much more scarier than the shambling ones. The beginning is so quick and concise right to the action and that overhead shot showing the spread is amazing. Good acting, not the best, probably the weakest part though I think there were certain performances that stood out like Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley. This seems to be where Zack Snyder showed his talent and has gone on to do great things. Also James Gunn's writing has that great sense of enjoyable horror and action that has shown through in several of his other works. I think this movies was what first engaged me in zombie films and how terrifying they really can be. It brought the next generation since this was a remake of an old classic and though the story is similar, it feels fresh. (Spoiler: the biggest flaw is the zombie baby) This is my first review so I hope to get better at this as I go along!",Dawn of the Dead
111,EijnarAmadeus,Brutally intense and effective,7,22 June 2005,"A recreation of the classic from the 70ties may seem unnecessary, though it's always great fun watching them. With the ultimate zombie-gore movie DAWN OF THE DEAD as it's proceeder, the movie does all the same things that the original do in storytelling and plot ways. Ana comes home from her job as a nurse at the hospital to fall in sleep together with her husband, waking up the next day her husband is brutally attacked by the neighbor girl and kills him. He wakes up again and attacks her, and Ana understands quickly that she is one of the few that hasn't been bitten while driving threw the city filled violence, zombies and fires. Teaming up with a group of certainly not-dead people, they make a fort in a supermarket along with the peculiar security guards to starts a war against the undead...The sort of problem with these kind of movies, is that they get so intense in the length. Wherever the camera turns, it's a zombie ducking up from behind the counter or whatever and by those means; the movie is a bit irritating and bothers you more than it frights or entertains. Filled with dozens of weird and sick characters, and off course some normal, the team of people does a lot of very un-realistic moves in their way to kill and get away, were almost everything they do is about suicidal. Kenneth, the rough cop played by Ving Rhames, is probably the most trust-able of them all, except Ana that is, he loads his shotgun several times to blow a zombie's head off - and with the movie filled with violence and gore, it's also close to disgusting time after time, but hey - it's a zombie movie.DAWN OF THE DEAD gives us also several close-up shots to the undead, that's practically always filled with blood in their face and has some ugly scars right across the face or in the forehead or whatever, making them look monsters every one of them. The irony and sarcasm of the original has been pulled away to be replaced by more serious means and character development, though the black humor of them sitting on the roof tops shooting at celebrity-lookalikes among the undead is pretty sick anyway. It's not a happy movie, no movie to play on whatever kind of celebrations it may be, because it's so intense and effective in it's brutal reflections that it doesn't get pleasing watching it. Truly disgusting scenes flash upon you over and over, and the movie has got this kind of news-channel mood that puts it all very close to you. The opening with Johnny Cash tumbling a song in the background doesn't make the scene that serious, but with effective sound effects and pure gore this is a movie that's very serious and tense.No movie for the whole family that's for sure, but for a group of teenagers bored and wanting to see something disgusting and bloody maybe? Though only that in fact is pretty scary.",Dawn of the Dead
112,deatman9,good movie poorly performed.,6,19 October 2012,"This is a remake of the classic dawn of the dead and it does not a bad job of living up to the original. The story sticks close to the same but there is some things that botherd me. The acting is terrible by everyone except maybe one of the cast and the zombies run....which everyone knows is impossible. Other then that though its not bad, the action scenes are intense and gory for the zombie lover fan.This movie is about a woman who in the middle of the night is attacked by a little girl with some kind of disease. The girl bites he husband and gives him the disease which turns him into a flesh eating monster. She runs from him and ends up with a group of people who decide to go to the mall to try to survive agaisnt the hoards of the undead.This movie was pretty good besides the acting of course. The story line was good and there were some nice twists and turns. Quite entertaining with lots of zombie killing",Dawn of the Dead
113,Son_of_Mansfield,Dawn Rises Again.,8,5 April 2006,"The original is a classic, so why bother with a remake? People don't seem to understand that a remake is made to honor the original. This is probably because most remakes aren't worth the film they are shot on. But this is worth it. The spirit of Romero's Dawn of the Dead lives on in this film which uses the same basic storyline of the original while updating the elements. The music is great. The creepy ""When The Man Comes Around"" plays over the blood soaked titles, which display scenes of human on human carnage. ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" plays in the empty mall as the plague rages outside. There is a great montage in the middle of the film that features a 50's lounge version of ""Down With The Sickness."" The barb filled script by James Gunn and claustrophobic direction by Zack Snyder are both sturdy. My two major complaints with the movie are that there are far too many characters and the ending should be more of a part of the film. It is obvious that many of the people are there solely to die and the reverse Zombie 2 ending is depressing in it's choppiness. The many references to the first three of Romero's dead films are great as are the cameos by Savini, Foree, and Reiniger. The saturated look of the film is potent and makes the gore scenes that much better. The scenes in Ana's bedroom, in the parking garage, with the bloated women, with the baby, and shooting the stars are all highly enjoyable. Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames bring respect to the cast while Michael Kelly and Ty Burrell make fine jerks, one redeemable and one not. The best remake in a long time, made me want to watch the original again, which made me want to watch this again, which...",Dawn of the Dead
114,Superunknovvn,Is the horror genre on a role again or what?,8,19 April 2004,"""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" & ""The Ring"" proved that classic horror movies can be remade even better and ""Dawn Of The Dead"" gloriously follows that tradition.MINOR SPOILERS: The movie grabs you right from the beginning. The first 15 minutes are absolutely admirable: first you see a close up of an x-ray of a skull and then the movie just bursts with action. The explosions and car chases are filmed so nicely it will take your breath away. And then in the middle of all that chaos the credits first appear to the sounds of Johnny Cash' ""The Man Comes Around"" while we see short clips of the Zombies taking over America. How great is that? A song hasn't been used so effectively since ""Layla"" in ""GoodFellas"". END OF SPOILERSThankfully, the movie doesn't let you down or gets boring from there on. The characters are interesting and believable and there's just the right amount of humor (dark humor, that is). On the negative side, the movie did have some rather laughable scenes, too.MORE SPOILERS: The zombie baby was unnecessary. They could at least have made more of it instead of just shooting it after that ridiculous monologue by the father. And why did the guy on the other roof hold up a card with blood on it after his transformation? Why would a Zombie do that? Also, the explosions in the end were too much over the top. The people in the trucks wouldn't have survived that kind of detonation themselves. END OF SPOILERSAnyway, personally, I'm not a fan of Zombie movies at all, but this one totally  convinced me. Bottom line: if you see only one Zombie flick in your life, this is the one. Bring on the remake of ""Day Of The Dead""!",Dawn of the Dead
115,Movie-Misfit,One Of Snyders Best!!,8,12 October 2019,"I remember when this first came out, the buzz about it and the apprehension going to see it. After all, 28 Days Later had already made such a splash and a remake of such a classic was never met with any positivity really...But what a surprise then, and even now - watching it years later - it still rocks and delivers on horror and action.This was Zack Snyder's first feature as a director and it certainly shows what a different director he was then to the one he became once the Hollywood doors flung open!!Scripted by Guardians of the Galaxy director, James Gunn, this fast moving remake is packed full of gore, violence, action, and memorable moments that definitely made it a favourite among horror fans all over.While it is a no-brainer, there is a couple of minor gripes for me that stop it from being a 5 star film. These would be due to a few silly moments, typically stupid American stereotypes and lines, and couple of annoying characters - especially the young girl who comes in second half and messes everything up over a dog...Ridiculous.In fact, the movie could have went a totally different way had she just got thrown to the zombies!Apart from that though, I do love this film. I think Snyder should sit down and rewatch this before he sets out to do anything else and get a reminder of how creativity works best when budget can't...",Dawn of the Dead
116,TheOtherFool,Those darn Zombies again!,7,11 October 2004,"'Dawn' always was the most appealing of the Romero trilogy, so I guess they made a good choice remaking this one.The movie starts literally like a blast. When coming home from work Ana (Sarah Polley) finds her husband becoming a zombie after being bit by a little girl. She flees with her car while around her the neighbourhood and the whole city collapses. Fantastic heli shots in this one, you should see the movie just for that.She then meets up with a group of people, and they all get trapped inside a mall while thousands of zombies try to get in, like in the original. Of course not everybody will make the end alive...There's some pretty gory shots in this one (check out the birth!), but it's all great fun. One to watch, although I still think 'Shaun' is the better movie...7/10.",Dawn of the Dead
117,tomimt,This time the deaders won't crawl... they run,7,19 May 2007,"You ever had a day, when you wake up in the morning everything starts to go down the drain?. Ana (Sarah Polley) certainly has, when nice little girls rips her husbands throat open and after a furious escape she notices, that the whole city has gone to hell. With growling and running zombies in the every corner.So after some running Ana and policeman Kenneth (Ving Rhames) end up in a mall with some other refugees. There they meet every stereotypical character of any zombie movie, have some great time, shoot zombies from a roof and finally make their doomed escape. And that's all there is to it.There isn't anything original or new to the genre in this film, but there's no real need for that either. The film looks good, actors do great job, and the effects work, well at least most of the time. There are those mandatory who fells for who and other sappy crap moments in the film, but mostly it's just fun zombie flick, that isn't very scary.Snyder has managed to scrape together good apocalyptic action film, that isn't an embarrassment to Romero's original film.",Dawn of the Dead
118,MattyGibbs,Brilliant Zombie horror,10,30 August 2014,"Dawn of the Dead is one of the best Zombie films ever made. It combines a decent storyline, good acting, nice cinematography, good dialogue, good soundtrack and is genuinely scary. From it's brilliant realised and scary opening, Dawn of the Dead holds you by the throat and doesn't let go. The action is pretty much non stop and at times it becomes unbearably tense. As well as a huge amount of gory scenes to keep bloodhounds satisfied it throws in a number of human interest sub plots as the survivors come to terms with their predicament. This stops this being just another one dimensional gore-fest. What elevates it above most of is that it has characters are not only interesting but totally believable. All the cast do a good job in particular Michael Kelly as the power crazy CJ and Sarah Polley, Jake Webber and Ving Rhames as the main survivors. This is an incredibly entertaining film packed full of memorable scenes. Most films are let down by their ending but this one is highly satisfactory if a little bleak. Anyone that likes Zombie movies is almost certain to like it. In my opinion it is pretty much the perfect Zombie movie. Highly recommended.",Dawn of the Dead
119,Darkside-Reviewer,Dawn of the Sickness,6,20 June 2019,Well not as good as the original this remake was well made taking key elements from the original movie and modernising them whilst adding new ideas and characters into the zombie movie formula.The movie follows a small group of survivors of a zombie outbreak who decide to bunker down in a shopping mall where they have endless supplys until they are rescued but time passes by and no one comes to there aid and with the hundreds of zombies waiting at there front door they all have one question on there mind what now?.This movie came at a time when there was a lot of remakes being made and 90% of them were bad while there are some good remakes like this movie were overlooked due to oversaturation of movies attempting to cash in on peoples nostalgia.If you haven't already seen this movie I recommend giving it a watch while it's not the best zombie movie out there it still gives us what we expect blood guts guns and action.,Dawn of the Dead
120,gigan-92,One of the Few Well-Made Horror Re-Makes,9,20 March 2012,"Zack Synder is one of the finest contemporary directors of our time. Here he's taken a 1978 masterpiece and has managed to create a version that pays tribute to the original but is also different enough not to feel unnecessary (kinda vice versa how ""Predators"" felt unnecessary even though it WASN'T a re-make, it sure felt like one with the countless homages). I felt the Tom Savini directed re-make of ""Night of the Living Dead"" was a great movie, while the Nick Cannon-starring re-make of ""Day of the Dead"" was just plain sh*tty. This film stands on its own remarkably well.It has awesome cameos of Tom Savini, Ken Foree and yes Scott Reiniger fans of the original will enjoy. I'm surprised they didn't sneak in George Romero in there somewhere (maybe he's one of the zombies if you look hard enough...). Any who, the characters do have less screen time individually due to a larger cast, but they're still pretty memorable. Most noteworthy of them all is Ving Rhames obviously. He's the new zombie-killing bad ass. Sarah Polley, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer and Michael Kelly all do really well. The director's cut is definitely the way to go, you get to further immerse yourself into the world set up by the camera. As for for the zombies, I whole heartedly prefer the original designs. The slow movement allows you to analyze the disgusting details as it were. The zombies in this film are agile and fast movers, probably somewhat inspired from the 'zombies' of ""28 Days Later"". It works because the film is aiming more for action than grueling horror which is easy to tell thru a lot of its comedic moments. And yes, credit to Tyler Bates for creating a very effective score.While not up to par with the original, this one is definitely worth a look due to a different, fast-paced direction. The director's cut is the preferred edition to see it.",Dawn of the Dead
121,movieguy1021,Dawn of the Dead: 8/10,8,4 April 2004,"I hate remakes, especially unnecessary ones. There's no reason for them to exist, and unless it goes into a completely new direction (kind of like a ""re-imagining"", like Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes), it's worthless. Yet I found myself going to see the new, ultra-violent version of George A. Romero's classic horror movie Dawn of the Dead. I haven't seen the original (the only movie of the original Dead series I've seen is the first one, Night of the Living Dead), but I can tell that the original was nowhere near as violent and gory, and probably had more social commentary than the thin layer that's in this version, but it's probably not as scary and entertaining as this version.Ana (Sarah Polley) is forced to take refuge in the local mall after a zombie killed her husband. There, she meets up with other survivors, such as Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Michael (Jake Weber), and Andre (Mekhi Phifer). Along the way (as they have to keep the zombies out of the mall), a baby must be born, dogs have to run through hoards of zombies, and much, much more. Let the fun begin.Dawn of the Dead could have gone terribly, terribly wrong, like it's half-cousin 28 Days Later. With all of this blood and maiming, freshman director Zack Snyder could have focused too much on making the blood sensible while still having shock value. However, Dawn is actually scary. It's not continuously scary, but many scenes were, and, unlike 28 Days, they didn't last for just five seconds. And even better (compared to other recent horror movies), all of the scares weren't either just ""jump"" scares, or began by that. One problem I had, though, was that so many characters became involved towards the middle that it was impossible to guess the order in which everyone would die.There's lots to say about mindless people clamoring to get into a mall in terms of social statements. Is this what we've become? Yes it is, but this takes second podium to the buckets of blood and crazy zombie killing. I don't really consider myself a gorehound, but I expect that when people get killed, there's blood (re: Halloween), but, obviously, this movie is not realistic. This is what a horror movie should be: scary, bloody, funny, and filled with Ving Rhames.I do have a few qualms with this movie, though. First, I found it annoying how the camera switched from film to handheld, making no connection between the two and making it hard to watch at times. Second, random characters just jump in at inconsequential times. Lastly, it loses track of where it's going towards the third act, but other than that, I would call Dawn of the Dead one of the best horror movies of this millennium so far.My rating: 8/10Rated R for pervasive strong horror violence and gore, language and sexuality.",Dawn of the Dead

It had the correct amount of comedy and that seriousness about it. I know this is a remake but believe it or not I've not seen the 1978 version. I'm always going to be happy with my ratings of zombie films because I love zombie stuff but this one is genuinely really good. I'm so glad Netflix has put this on.

Romero's masterpiece ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 1979 was going to be remade, i was really upset. I mean why mess with something that wasn't even broke in the first place? sheesh, then when i saw the trailer to it, i thought it might not be so bad. Afterall the original 1979 version is one of my favorite movies of all time, i did went to see this version in the theater and was pleasantly surprised of how well this was well made. This is a spectacular update of George A. Romero's classic and worked just like the 1990 remake to ""Night of the Living Dead"" , this movie offers great performances by the cast and marks the debut of visionary Zack Sydner who gave us ""300"" and the upcoming ""Watchmen"". this movie is loaded with action and over the top gore like exploding heads, implements and of course the zombies here are fast like in the tradition of ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Nightmare City"", ""Lifeforce"" or ""The Stuff"".

124,dr_foreman,attack of the zombie marathon runners,7,22 March 2004,"I've soured on horror films lately - aren't they just the most repulsive things ever? - and yet ""Dawn of the Dead"" won me over simply by being, well...exciting!  Most of the gore is confined to the first few minutes (the worst of it, anyway), and the rest of the film relies more on tension than violence.  So there's not too many long, lingering shots of people being eaten alive - thank goodness.Of course it's no masterpiece, but then again neither was the original (I don't think that a few comparisons between zombies and mall shoppers makes for an insightful social commentary!).  The main thing is that it's a bloody good siege story, and the characters - though thinly developed - are likable enough that you want them to survive.   I figured that Rhames and Polley would be good, but the surprise show-stealer here is Jake Weber's Michael, who distinguishes himself from the crowd by not shouting all the time. 
Huge gun battles, a pair of cool armored buses, and loads of tragic deaths keep the film rockin' on until the surprise climax, which is a bit too snide for me, but nonetheless effective.  I'm not sure I like the running zombies; they're very ""28 Days Later"" and very human-like in their movements, whereas the original lurching brand of zombie seemed more alien and therefore more frightening.  Still, faster zombies means extra action and a greater chance that the heroes will be caught, so there's both pluses and minuses to the new approach.",Dawn of the Dead

(Very entertaining, with load of - action, guns, zombies and running survivors.) The story is still intact as the original, and is having a brilliant casting leading by Sarah Polley. The acting is very decent and is very convincing. The camera work is brilliant with still base on the original film and with higher budget some of the scene are ""Woah"".

A lot of people said that Dawn of the Dead is a great horror film and it's gotten good reviews, so why not? I watched it. The film wasn't as good as I thought it would be. In fact, I thought it was more funny than scary because of how the dead zombies acted. The acting was alright, a few corny lines and some bad dialouge but they did alright, I guess. The gun owner named Andy was my favorite character because I thought he was a bad ass. Too bad things didn't exactly happen right for him. Overall, a decent horror film with some freaky scenes and the movie entertains you for sure. Usually, I tend to think that most all of horror films are really bad but this film wasn't bad at all, but just not exactly good. Decent film to say the most for Dawn of the Dead.

The film is packed with action, some new suspenseful situations, and some nicely done humor. This remake is all the more intense because it doesn't use the typical 'zombie' image, but rather re-invents the flesh-eaters as more cunning creatures, after all they do run in this film! There's also plenty of freakishly good make up FX to be had and a great rock soundtrack.The cast is pretty good, Polley, Rhames, Weber, Kelly, Booth, and Zegers being especially good characters.Dawn of the Dead 2004 remains the most critically acclaimed horror remake thus far, and it's not hard to see why.*** out of ****",Dawn of the Dead

I liked Dawn Of The Dead because it avoided this fairly well at times. But during a few scenes the irrational stupidity of characters shone through. In fact one of the best examples of any horror movie stupidity presented itself when the character Steve (alone and in the dark as usual) puts down a perfectly good weapon (a crowbar) and picks up a lesser weapon, a croquet mallet. A nearly unbreakable heavy metal bar or a fabricated piece of cheap wood, what sane person in dire circumstances would prefer the later to the former? Perhaps, yes, i am over thinking the movie here (instead of sitting back and immersing myself) but this type of stupidity leaves me feeling as though i am the fool for wasting my money.low 6 out of 10",Dawn of the Dead

Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" back in 1978 was a masterpiece in horror cinema that not only did I say it is the best horror movie of it's kind, but I ranked it on my top ten list of best films of all time.Just like many movie studios, everybody wants to remake classic films to give them a little edge. Some of them worked from Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear (1991) to Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) where it was about different points of view and trying so hard to be faithful to their counterparts. Other remakes never fulfilled like Gus Van Sant's Psycho (1998) where it felt like I was watching the film but in color with goofier content.Here in the remake of DOTD, Zack Synder, who would later direct 300, paces up to speed where after watching 28 Days Later...(2002), he wants his zombies in America to run faster compared to the slow and smart zombies in Romero's movies. The film starts with Ana (Sarah Polley) coming home from the late shift at a hospital where she falls to bed with her husband before seeing a little girl filled with blood in her mouth approaching the married couple where Ana's husband is attacked and turned into a wild and venomous monster within seconds and after her flesh. She flees her home and sees hell breaking out from car crashes, people begging to be safe from the creatures; some are even being devoured by the cannibals in front of her eyes. She meets up with survivors Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a cop with a shotgun; Andre (Mekhi Phifer) a thug who has his Russian pregnant wife; and then there's Michael (Jake Weber) a TV salesman. The five of them head for the mall where they noticed that they're not alone with three security guards and other people getting involved where they witness that an epidemic has hit the scale with people turning into these creatures. The mall is filled with ravenous zombies but not before they make their hideout their sweat haven.The film also makes references to the original masterpiece where the stores are named after actors from the 1978 movie to even cameo appearances from Ken Foree, Tom Savini and Scott Reinger.I liked the film. It was a little edgier and much, much more violent and graphic than the original.

131,danielmanson,An above average film,6,10 October 2021,"With it being Halloween season I thought I'd watch this for the first time and I have to say it's not bad at all. I do love watching films, horror in particular, from years ago, because it really emphasises how far cinema has come. Off the bat you have this really fake blood everywhere and over the top acting to get you scared. However, it's still fun and that's what makes these films great.I won't do a huge review, just gonna quickly whack down the bits that annoyed and move on.1. Characters. A couple were very unlikeable, but overall I'd say 50% of them were just forgettable. Like, I've just seen this film and I cannot remember the names of most. I thought a few of them would make some really annoying and illogical decisions also.2. The first half of the film I thought was quite slow paced. The second half was really fun, but the first was just a little boring.3. Is it scary? No. I think this might be more to do with what people found scary 17 years ago, but there isn't really any jump scares or anything. It's more just a classic case of zombies everywhere.Having said all that, it's a fun film. The final half an hour or so is brilliant and I was completely absorbed by it. I got massive Left 4 Dead vibes watching this and I loved that gaming franchise. But yeah, it's an fun and entertaining film. Don't expect a serious, in depth horror though, because you will be let down. I'd recommend, it's definitely above average, hence the 6/10. But it's not much more than that, just take it as it is and have a bit of fun and see some zombies die.",Dawn of the Dead

133,Shattered_Wake,S_W's review of 'Dawn of the Dead' (2004),8,5 March 2008,"Title: Dawn of the Dead U.S. Release Date: 19 March 2004 Directed by: Zack Snyder Written by: James Gunn Running Time: 101 minutes Synopsis: After a Milwaukee zombie outbreak, a nurse (Sarah Polley), a cop (Ving Rhames), a gang member (Mekhi Phifer), a regular Joe (Jake Weber) and others take refuge in a shopping mall along with some jerk security guards. . . and flesh-eating corpses.Cause of Outbreak: Unknown, but some supernatural type (according to Snyder) Review: This film is probably my favourite horror remake ever, which is pretty impressive seeing as it's a remake of the second best zombie flick in cinematic history. What makes this remake different is that Snyder and Gunn took the original idea, modernized it, but made it their own. Usually, the makers will either go for a strict modernization without making it their own (the 'Psycho' and 'The Omen' remakes come to mind), or they'll leave the original ENTIRELY with almost nothing but a few references to relate it to the original (the 'Day of the Dead' remake, for example). When it comes down to it, almost everything about this film is pretty damn good. Even for an ensemble cast, the characters are all very well formed with their own distinct voices (helped by some fine acting). The music is great and often hilarious (Cheese rendition of Disturbed). Zack Snyder's eye for action proves to be more than substantial. And, finally, James Gunn's script perfectly fuses terror and humour in a way many horror writers strive for, but rarely achieve. Overall, it's a great action-horror/popcorn flick with some genuine scares and high-quality film-making.Final Verdict: 8/10 Recommended? Yes, unless you're anti-remake and/or enjoyable modern horror and 'popcorn cinema.' -AP3-",Dawn of the Dead
134,markovd111,Well...,6,11 June 2019,"Seeing the glorious reviews, I expected nothing but a good zombie fun. What I got was... Well... Let's just say the first half of the movie is bad... Characters aren't acting realistic, nor according to the situation and the movie is trying too much to be serious by exploring some themes and there are sexual scenes sprinkled all through the movie... It just feels wrong... No nihilistic feeling of dread and depression like the first Romero's trilogy. Oh, and the zombies aren't slow, they run. Then the second part of the movie starts, and things finally get together... What you get in second part is practically ""Left 4 Dead"" in a movie, which is no surprise, because the movie probably served as an inspiration for the game. And while it lasts, it's awesome... Aaaand, then they ruin it with the credits scene. I can understand why people like it, and on it's own, it's OK movie, but compared to the original, it's bad. Remake of the ""Night of the Living Dead"" was much better than this. I give it 6/10. Zombie fans will be right at home here, but forget about any kind of horror (it's just jumpscares whole way through).",Dawn of the Dead

136,domino1003,Interesting Re-Telling Of A Classic (SPOILERS!!!),8,30 March 2004,"I just got home after seeing ""Dawn Of The Dead,"" and I immediately rushed to the computer to place my thoughts on this site. After being stoked for the past few months and after watching the 10 minute clip on USA, I settled into the seat and watched, transfixed at the screen and watched the fun begin. It is a very good film (Although the camera-work made me a bit dizzy and the sound system gave me a severe migraine)with an interesting story. No need to re-cap what it's about, but I will tell you that the humor is really on target (Especially the celebrity look-a-likes that get bumped off), the zombies are incredibly SCARY! (The thought of those things running after me scared me so much that I had to look over my shoulder on my way to my car), and it wasn't too heavy on gore (Just graphic violence). The ending reminded me of 1979's ""Zombie"" (Those who have seen this film will understand). One word of note: watch the final credits! My one gripe is with Matt Frewer, because he really wasn't in the film that long (At least 5 minutes). Other than that, this was a truly excellent film. I HIGHLY recommend the unrated version, with the bonus footage and the behind-the scenes stuff. For fun, watch it back-to-back with the original version.",Dawn of the Dead

There's a good bunch of characters (even some development-see CJ's redemption), a nice helping of zombie suspense and gore (the special effects are excellent), and an engaging escape plot added at the end.

139,emperor_bender,Very good for a remake,8,18 February 2008,"This was a great remake of the already great Dawn of the Dead. This was pretty much a new movie based on the concept of the original. This movie did not really stick to the original...which is actually a good thing. I like when remakes come up with new ideas of their own. I liked the more modernized feel this movie brought with it. Also, there were a lot more main characters to root for, which I enjoyed. There was a variety of them too, rich, hick, jerk, crook, cop, nurse, truckers, doctor, model, you name it. I liked Andy, the gun shop owner across the street. He made me laugh a few times, along with Ving Rhames. Also there were new zombies. These zombies were faster and much more deadly than the original ones. Although I enjoyed this movie, it had its share of flaws I think. But don't let that stop you from watching this. I recommend this movie to fans of zombie movies, and maybe even to fans of the original Dawn of the Dead and the rest of Romero's ""Dead"" series. 8/10",Dawn of the Dead
140,Gafke,VERY Well Done!,10,20 March 2004,"I've seen the original ""Dawn of the Dead."" I loved the original ""Dawn of the Dead."" I loved this one too, probably because I didn't see it as a remake, I simply accepted it as an updated retelling. I can also accept the fact that both of these movies ARE JUST MOVIES! So, I'm going to skip the purist arguments and just review the damn film.In the first five minutes of ""Dawn of the Dead"" we are introduced to the blase, perfectly normal ho-hum life of a nurse named Ana, who just wants to go home after a long shift and see her man. They have a nice, quiet evening together and fall asleep in each others arms without a care in the world. The next five minutes that follow Ana into the next morning are a violent, brutal shock. Instant carnage erupts as the little girl next door attacks Ana's man. Infected and mortally wounded, he turns on Ana. Within two minutes of awakening from a peaceful sleep, Ana is blood drenched and in shock, hurling herself out of the bathroom window only to see a world gone mad. Her peaceful neighborhood is in ruins, her neighbors are the undead insane, feasting on the few living left. As she escapes the burning ruin of her safe little world, the camera pulls back and gives us a glorious crane shot of apocalypse. The distant city is ablaze, the roads are overrun with ghouls. There is nowhere to go. It is indeed an awe inspiring, overwhelming sight. There is no safe place left. The feeling of isolation and growing fear is enormous. From there, the movie centers on the refuge of a local shopping mall, which is littered with clever in-jokes that are never pointed out or lingered on too long. (The Gaylen Ross store? Nice...) The survivors gather together hesitantly, each eyeing the other with suspicion. There is no time to grieve for the dead with survivors straggling in, some injured, some not...and some on the way to ZombieLand. No one knows who to trust, and not everyone is what they seem. They still manage to forge hesitant friendships and there are some genuinely comic moments involving a long-distance chess game, the bored mallers taking target practice on some appropriately nicknamed zombies, and a great rendition of Disturbed's ""The Sickness"" performed Lounge Style. Finally, after a horrific quadruple death scene which wipes out an entire family, the survivors can take no more. They have a plan to escape and make for the ocean, and from there to a distant and unoccupied island far away from the overrun mainland. This movie certainly owes much to the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" but there are also touches of ""Day of the Dead"" and Fulci's ""Zombi 2"" here as well. All in all, this film succeeds. It is strong enough to stand apart from the original. It may not bypass it, but it is a powerful entry in the zombie genre. The gore is understated, though brutally shocking when it does make its appearance. The real drive of the story here are the characters. These are not meat-for-the- grinder disposable heroes at all; they are very real, and very sympathetic. I found it very easy to imagine myself in their situation, and this is the films strength. The performances are wonderful, totally believable and the sorrow very genuine when one of the cast falls. There ARE truly fates worse than death, and this films shows you every last one. This is NOT a film about zombies. This is a film about staying sane in a world gone mad. Despite a downbeat ending (for anyone who sat through the end credits, that is...) this is a film I would see again and again....just like the original.",Dawn of the Dead
141,supertom-3,Etertaining gore-fest!,7,1 November 2004,"This is a remake of the seminal zombie classic and the second zombie film of the year, so how does it match up to the original and indeed Shaun Of The Dead? Well in truth it gets thoroughly beaten hard by the other two but this is still a very enjoyable gore fest. The film is a loving homage to the original taking pretty much the same story and setting of a group of survivors holding up in a mall while thousands of peckish zombies try to break in and eat them. It's got a clichéd group of characters as is usually the case and lacks the heart of the original but this is a very polished and expertly crafted piece of schlock horror. Cast wise there is no star name to headline and ride this like an ego-vehicle and stink up the place, this relies on unknowns and cult actors. In fact the biggest names in this are Vhing Rhames, Mekhi Phifer and Sarah Polley. All the cast are good and Jake Weber in particular is excellent. There is certainly a good mixture in the cast and each character is different. Director Zack Snyder handles things well and creates tension while letting lose when the action hits overdrive. Like Dawn Of The Dead in 78, this film has superlative gore effects. In fact this was a superbly gruesome movie with plenty of zombie biting and flying entrails to keep the gore nuts happy. It is a key element for a film such as this and thankfully the effects are spot on. The film is entertaining and while it's not the best zombie film it has a great beginning that grabs the audience by the nuts and then does so again with the superb ending. ***½",Dawn of the Dead
142,skybrick736,Dawn of the Dead (2004) 6/10,6,10 July 2015,"As a stand-alone zombie movie, Dawn of the Dead is an action packed nail biter after an initial watch. However, after consideration, there are massive plot holes and characters making the wrong choices throughout the film. At one point, all the characters were in a gun shop with zombies surrounding them and then all of a sudden, a terrible cut, and they all end up in the sewers. How does that happen? The girl going on a suicide mission for a dog was incredibly dumbfounding too. The ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake is widely entertaining and worth a rent or look on television but it fails in a lot of potentially credible spots.",Dawn of the Dead
143,dead47548,Fun enough.,6,8 January 2008,"An exceptionally fun, zombie-slaying time. It sticks to the basic horror formula of 'Everything is fine, turmoil, everything is good again, huge problem, attempt to solve it, happy ending' but makes everything a lot more fun and gory than the average weekly gorefest. The performances are all pretty nice, notably a surprising turn from Sarah Polley into a much more mainstream environment, and no one really distracts from the story of the film. All of the gore and violent scenes are very well done and are some of the best entertainment of the decade. Attempts at a more supernatural form of horror, like the baby delivery, are poorly done and tend to take you out of the thrill of the rest of the film but they are few and far in between. It gets a bit dull at time, but as always, the final act is exhilarating and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The finale is bittersweet and a perfect end to the picture.",Dawn of the Dead
144,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,3 March 2005,"Being a zombie movie fan, i have much enjoyed the recent (continuing) resurgence of the genre. As i believe that Romero's Dawn is not only the best zombie movie ever, but one of the best horror movies, i was both excited and sceptical to hear about a remake. Reasons for excitement- 1. It's zombies. 2. A big budget. 3. If done right, could be brilliant. Reasons for scepticism- 1. A big budget. 2. Less gore, less shock value. 3. If done wrong could be awful, and possibly tarnish the name of the original in some people's eyes.I soon heard that the zombies would be able to run- a source of many arguments among fans and purists. On one side, the zombies were scarier because their slow speed was irrelevant, they would probably get you in the end through sheer numbers or by the fact that they don't get tired. Slow zombies were scary because they were falling to pieces. However, on the other side, people who have recently turned may still be in good shape so should be able to run until they begin to decay. Fast zombies make the threat more immediate and therefore give rise to more jumpy moments. Fast zombies mean we have an even smaller chance of survival as we may not be able to outrun them. Some have said the zombies in this are 'super-fast', but this is nonsense. A zombie should only be as fast as it was before it turned, more likely slower, but will not get out of breath. All this running will however mean quicker decay. What it all boils down too in the end is whether you can make your choice effective, and in both films, both directors succeed.A Nurse, Ana, during and after a heavy shift fails to notice the news reports that the dead are attacking the living. It is probably rubbish anyway, and she just wants to get home to suburbia. The next morning, her young neighbour enters her bedroom; She seems to be hurt. When her husband investigates, she attacks him, biting off part of his throat. He dies, the phone is engaged, but he quickly rises again and goes for his wife. When she escapes the house she witnesses chaos, people screaming, houses on fire and being attacked, her neighbour with a gun, promptly run over by an ambulance. She escapes in her car only to crash after seeing the scale of the madness. Soon she meets with a cop- Kenneth, Michael, Andre and his pregnant girlfriend Luda. They decide to hide in a local mall only to find that Store guards have claimed it for their own. However, they work out a compromise and soon other survivors join them. As the days pass, they try to work out a solution, how to maintain their safety and sanity. When an attempt to send food to Andy, a survivor on the roof of a gun shop a few hundred yards away goes wrong, the zombies get into the mall, and the remaining survivors flee. Their plan to escape to an island by boat seems good, but it is based on pure hope, and the desire to get out of their present situation, rushed, and the hordes continue to chase.The film lacks the brains and atmosphere of Romero's masterpiece. But it makes up for this by giving an excellent view of how contemporary people would likely react to the situation. The film begins quickly, and to the director's credit, the pace continues throughout. Anytime something good happens, something worse happens to bring the characters to an even lower state. It is frantic, but never out of control, and their is a fair amount of tension. Once we realise the zombies are fast, we are on edge, prepared for one or one hundred to come racing round the nearest shadowy corner. The actors all do well, particularly Polley and the excellent Weber. His character is just a normal guy, a failure at many things, but who will not give up. Rhames is tough, but doesn't set out on his own, knowing that he is needed. The soundtrack is more conventional,with booming rock songs being played over each attack, but this heightens the chaos. There is little hope left at the end, and little time for discussion over why this has happened. There are a few good set pieces, and the gore is good for a modern mainstream film. There are a few funny moments, and of course, another staple of zombie films, an annoying character-Steve. The best of the recent serious zombie films by a wide margin, lets see if Romero can regain his crown.8 out of 10",Dawn of the Dead
145,charchuk,"Exhilarating, well-made, and very cool",8,1 September 2006,"Quite entertaining, very well-made, and just plain cool. Though much more action than horror, and perhaps containing too much zombie killing and not enough social commentary, but this is mere nitpicking. The beginning is simply brilliant, from the opening attack scene to the driving scene, which is so well shot and just chilling in its depiction of the apocalypse. Not to mention the wicked credits, incorporating a Johnny Cash song into some memorable stock footage. The first 90 minutes or so of the film contains little action, but it serves the film well, as it would feel overdone. Case in point, the last twenty minutes are chocked full of such non-stop thrills that it's in dire need of a breath, but never gets one. The ending is just perfect, though, as it's just as uncompromising as the rest of the film. The acting is about as good as one can expect, and the direction is just awesome. All in all, a solid remake and an exhilarating film.",Dawn of the Dead
146,xamtaro,Zack Snyder's awesomely demented Zombie apocalypse Debut,9,24 November 2009,"Imagine living your uneventful life, day by day as a nurse in a county hospital. Then imagine waking up one fine morning, just in time to see your sweet little 10 year old neighbor gnaw your husband's neck open, killing him! That's not all as your husband suddenly gets up again, blood-lust in his eyes and tries to eat you! Such is the plight of poor Anna. As she flees her suburban home, she is greeted with a world of chaos. Some form of infection that turns humans into bloodthirsty undead zombies after they have been killed is spreading across the globe. This infection spreads through bites received from other zombies and there is no cure. Anna bands together with a few other survivors, and together they try to whether the zombie apocalypse inside a mall. But sometimes, the greatest danger might not be the obvious danger. What started off as a normal everyday morning has now become a DAWN OF THE DEAD! Love it or hate it, this remake by Zack Snyder is one of the finest horror movie remakes of the new century. Though it downplays the whole social satire/political undertones bit, it cranks up the action and drama. It can be argued that Dawn of the Dead 2004 is more of an action thriller movie than a horror movie; it is not scary aside from a couple of cheap shock moments. Snyder's versatile camera work and effective usage of slow motion enhances the impact of every gunshot, every limb severed and every zombie blasted to kingdom come.But do not let all that action fool you, this film thrives on its well written script, good acting and characters. Granted that the characters are mostly action and horror movie stereotypes (tough guy, emotional damsel, kick a55 gal, sombre hero, etc) but it is the drama that ensues as the diverse cast of characters interact with each other that drew me into this film. All of the characters are fully fleshed out with their own attitudes, motivations and reactions to their current predicaments. Every one of them is easy to relate to as they represent the ""every-man"". Under all that zombie killing action, this is a story about how grave situations can unite the most unlikeliest of allies and bring out the best in most people. It is just that easy to get emotionally invested in this movie. The fact that the cast are relative unknowns with no big name stars makes relating to the characters so much easier.One thing that stood out was Zack Snyder's usage of music and little nuanced references in the background to enhance the story such as the ""hallowed grounds"" coffee house where the survivors usually congregate and where they hold their funerals (references back to the old zombie movies where Zombies were considered unholy creatures that cannot harm people on hallowed grounds). The opening theme of ""The Man Comes Around"" set to scenes of Zombie carnage worldwide sets the overall subdued mood of a bleak post-apocalyptic land where Zombies rule the streets.Fans of the original 1978 classic might not be too happy with the amount of liberties this film takes. The zombies, the cast of characters, even the setting and feel of the movie are all vastly different. However, one can see these changes as an improvement. For example the savage, fast running zombies(now immortalized in recent games like Left 4 Dead) are a lot more dangerous than the dim witted lumbering ones in George A Romero's classic. Also the special effects, cinematography and story pacing are all better.Overall, Dawn of the Dead 2004 is an exciting, adrenaline charged piece of modern film-making that is sure to please any blockbuster fans. Horror fans may be a little let down by the lack of scares. Great makeup and effects, excellent acting from a cast of relative unknowns, and awesome cinematography coupled with an exceptionally witty script. The movie is well paced, never drags and has its fair share of sad and light hearted moments.(the best is the montage that plays over Richard Cheese's lounge version of ""Down with the Sickness""). Easily the best remake of a classic horror movie ever and a real treat for any movie goer.(Get the director's cut DVD. it's worth it)",Dawn of the Dead
147,christian123,Fun Remake,6,21 November 2004,"In this remake of the classic 70's zombie movie, a mysterious virus has turned the population of Minneapolis into flesh-eating zombies, forcing a group of survivors to hole up at the local abandoned mall, where they are surrounded by thousands of the blood-crazed savages. Can they survive, let alone escape, with the odd so set against them? Dawn of the Dead is a fast paced, horror film that will actually scare you. It's gory, scary and a lot of fun to watch. The original film is overrated in my eyes. It was corny and dull though that's probably because it is outdated. So, the remake surpasses the original film in pretty much everything. The original had a good chance to tell a really scary story and it kind of blew it. The remake does a better job at telling the story and it adds more characters. There's more suspense and a lot more action. The zombies also run in this version. I know some people will complain that it goes against the whole point but it was a lot scarier. Watching thousands of zombies run after humans just sounds scarier and it looks scarier as well.The acting was also pretty good and convincing with the best being Ving Rhames. He can change his emotions easily and gave a really good performance. Sarah Polley also gives a good performance without going over the top. Mekhi Phifer gives an okay performance, nothing special. The rest of the cast are made up of unknowns but they all do a good job. Most of the characters are interesting to watch and you want to root for most of them to survive. It's been a while since I have actually cared about the characters in a horror film.The movie also doesn't take itself too seriously. It can be serious and scary when it wants to be. It can have a funny side as well and that keeps the film from becoming boring. There's hardly a dull moment as everything is pretty interesting. This is Zack Snyder's first movie he has directed and he should get more opportunities to direct in the future. He keeps the film tense and scary the whole time. He really does have a good eye for suspense and horror. Would you believe the guy who wrote the screenplay for the Scooby Doo movies also wrote the screenplay for this remake? He does a pretty good job and I can't wait for his next movie. This is by far the best horror film of 2004 and it's a must see for horror fans. In the end, this very bloody and entertaining remake is worth checking out. Rating 9/10",Dawn of the Dead

There is hardly enough warning, and when the zombies suddenly strike in one city, a small group of people end up trapped inside a shopping mall while the growing numbers of the living dead swarm outside. This is a very well made zombie movie, and probably one of the best horror remakes there is.The entire concept of this movie is creepy, and the style that it's made in, with the shaky camera and fast pacing, manage to heighten the intensity of the movie. The special effects and make-up are as realistic as they could possibly get. The movie contains just the right kind of blend of action and horror, as well as throwing in a touch of comic relief here and there.The acting is extremely good for a zombie movie. When you've got good actors like Ving Rhames and Mekhi Pfeiffer in the movie, you know that there's not going to be any problems in the acting department.Overall, this isn't even a popcorn flick.

149,kgprophet,Rent the Original,5,26 March 2004,"I am a fan of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"".  I was in high school at the time and it was the first movie that really scared the bejesus out of me.  The extreme gore, and the heartpounding opening sequence where a group of people escape within inches of their lives.  This movie feels like it would've been better with another rewrite. It's too scattered to feel that sense of danger.  Only the 3 main characters thankfully have a bit of depth.  When the rest of the troop bites it over the the course of the movie,  it's little more than scorekeeping for the audience.  At least the film tried to explore a couple different angles from the first. But it feels like the first film had a bigger budget.  There are stretched out moments with no action, even our friends the zombies don't appear for long periods of time.  I liked some of the morality play,  and Jake Weber does a solid job as the voice of reason. 
I just didn't get the heebie jeebies like I thought I would.  ""28 Days Later"" got some good attention,  because you could sense the fear.  A tighter script with more action would have drawn you in more.  Nevertheless,  the success of this one will draw out a sequel. Maybe there will be better ideas and a better budget next time.5 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
150,eagandersongil,The first and important film of Zack Snyder,7,12 November 2018,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is, in a precarious way, one of the films that most resemble the classic films of Romero, a simple, voracious movie with traits of humor and terror, with gore, bizarre, suspense and character, a classic apocalypse, with all the well-defined symptoms and ingrained by the beloved and hated Zack Snyder, who already in his first feature already began to demonstrate his traits and exaggerations of unique directions, even if still timid.
Snyder has very well defined his script, he chooses to tell the story of a group of people, so he does not give an explanation about the apocalypse and does not extend much about the destruction of our civilization, this is summarized in an excellent clip of 5 minutes to the sound of a country classic and Snyder already defines in the first minutes the initial nucleus of the group of survivors, that in the future changes, however, the character developments are still in that first group, which gives an idea that the focus of the script was to play with the end-of-the-world issue in people, an interesting and well-made decision.
Snyder uses the script for the film, which is about the zombie instinct, when the world ends, hundreds of them go to the mall, an interesting question, we are alienated alive and dead, but none of this is the focus of the movie. to test many cinematographic techniques - such as the final post-credit - that would eventually make their mark, such as slow cameras, medium framing, gray photography, good use of soundtrack, and redemption of characters.
Zack Snyder knew how to explore the bizarre and the comic in a film, which although little known, is extremely important because it has caused a huge influence and has become a source of inquiries the inspiration for the gaming industry.

151,squeezebox,Didn't this movie already come out as 28 DAYS LATER?,6,19 April 2004,"**POSSIBLE SPOILER**This movie is less of a loose remake of George Romero's infinitely superior original than a not-so-subtle rip off of 28 DAYS LATER. It's even shot the same way. Then, to add insult to injury, there's a BLAIR WITCH rip off over the end credits. Despite that, the movie does have its merits, albeit few.The opening scenes are great, then it's a sketchy ride the rest of the way. There are some truly great moments, and the tone of the movie is winningly basic, but this is supposed to be a remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD, and therefore the lack of any of the original's depth or subtext is disappointing. The remakes of THE THING and THE FLY and CAPE FEAR took the original stories and reworked them, expanded on them and took them in new directions. This one doesn't. It takes the most threadbare elements of the original movie's story and stretches them out to ninety minutes. The rich characterizations and witty screenplay are absent here. The script is clichéd and one-note and the characters are the most one-dimensional I can recall seeing in a movie in years.James Gunn is obviously a talented writer. He wrote Troma's best movie (TROMEO AND JULIET) and obviously is capable of writing that is far more interesting and challenging than this. Let's not even get into the egregiously awful SCOOBY-DOO movies.DAWN OF THE DEAD 2004 is a pefectly okay zombie movie in its own right. It's better than, say, Umberto Lenzi's NIGHTMARE CITY or even the Australian disappointment UNDEAD. But that isn't saying much. If Gunn just wants to write screenplays for cash from now on, instead of writing anything with meaning or depth, that's fine. Just one more promising artist to throw onto the ever growing heap of hacks-for-hire.",Dawn of the Dead

I have seen many horror movies including Evil Dead, Hellraiser, Freddy movies, Jason Movies, Exorcist, Haloween and Texas Chain saw massacre. The List will go on, never have i been this entertained. Apart from Evil Dead, Dawn of the Dead is one of the most entertaining Horror movies ever made. Packed with lots and lots of gore, blood and violence, This is one roller-coaster ride of Fun. The 70s version was a Classic, but this version is Much better. The 70s dead walked very slowly, one step at a time. It will be easy for the survivors to escape. This version the dead run fast and attack their victim, making it tough for the survivors. Ving Rhames gives a good performance. I saw this movie first day at 11pm.

154,coldwaterpdh,Loses points because of the name.,5,11 January 2009,"2004's remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a classic example of a decent film that is hindered by being another in a long line of horror remakes.While not technically bad, one has to wonder: wouldn't it have been easier to omit a few technicalities from the script and plot and create a fresh, new zombie movie for us? While it did have similarities to the superior 1978 classic, it didn't have THAT much in common where a few things couldn't have been changed to create something original.Ving Rhames adequately portrays the bad ass while Sarah Polley is also great in the lead female role. The zombies move fast ALA ""Nightmare City"" and are genuinely scary in some parts.I really wanted to like this film except that it is called ""Dawn of the Dead."" This is not ""Dawn of the Dead,"" there is only one and it was directed by George Romero in 1978. After viewing, I felt like I did after I watched the awful ""Day of the Dead 2: Contagium."" I kept asking myself WHY WHY WHY? Get original, Hollywood. You obviously have the talent; is it really that hard to develop a new screenplay??? 5 out of 10, kids.",Dawn of the Dead
155,GeorgeRoots,"What Shouldn't Work, Wasn't All Too Bad.",6,17 August 2014,"At first you'd think ""Wow, what a horrible idea"". One of the most beloved horror-satire movies of all time really needs to be remade? Surprisingly, if you give it a chance you see that the movie had decided to do the smart thing. With a script handled by James Gunn, the satire of the original is removed and the film-makers go in there own direction with a totally different approach altogether. Still, the movie has its flaws and I don't think it holds up well to the original, making me wish it was just called something else. It'll definitely appeal to the younger generation of people who don't want to think, but would rather just see large amount of bullets and half a cast of dumb-ass, uninteresting characters just waiting to be eaten.Still, Zack Snyder did a solid job for his first feature. He definitely knows how to give visual flair to even the smallest things, and the camera catches everything well. Notable actors from the first movie make an appearance, and Sarah Polley as well as Ving Rhames are the most likable characters in a group that arguably may have too many people in it. It's definitely not a zombie movie for the Romero crowd that's for sure.Final Verdict: Enjoyable and not all bad for a Romero remake. Leave your brain at the door and have some fun. 6/10.",Dawn of the Dead
156,MovieGuy01,Good zombie horror movie....,7,2 November 2009,I thought that Dawn Of The Dead was a good horror film. It is about a young nurse named Ana who is returning from a hard day at work. wanting to go home and see her husband Louis. But not paying attention to an emergency broadcast telling the public about a deadly plague of flesh eating creatures. Until the next day when the next door neighbour a little girl comes into their house and bites Ana's husband Louis in the neck. But Louis does not stay dead. later he is up and trying to bite his wife Ana. Ana manages to escape in her car and sees members of the public being eaten by flesh eating zombies. She crashes into a tree. she is recovered by a black police officer called Kenneth. They group up with 3 more people and find shelter in a shopping mall called the Crossroads Mall. While they are in the mall they find 3 security guards there armed with guns. They wait for help to arrive But they are all running out of time and the zombies are approaching the mall. The dead are retuning to roam the earth. I thought that this was a very good zombie horror film with great acting from the cast. 7/10,Dawn of the Dead

It is fast paced, develops it's characters just enough that gets you invested into their survival. The slower scenes help build the tension and then the action hits. There were a few shots zoomed out to show the carnage that was happening all around our characters it added to the whole mood of the movie and made you question what is happening not to mention the realization that there must be millions of other stories happening to other people in this movies universe.I am not a big fan of gore, I tend to avoid it where possible. I also tend to not watch bleak movies (looking at you THE ROAD) since I find they stick with me for a long time and I don't care for that, no sir not one bit.

159,AndyVanScoyoc,What a vast disappointment ****Spoilers!!!****,4,22 March 2004,"I hardly know where to begin with this movie. I will start off by saying that I *did* go in to see this film with a completely open mind and will in no way compare this ""Dawn"" to the original ""Dawn."" I will simply state what I felt was a real letdown about this movie.While the direction and the characters were very well done, the plot and the logic for some of the scenes left much to be desired. I will start with the flashes of world outbreaks of violence and other such scenes at the beginning. If this was supposed to signify the spread of the virus, (a stretch) then they needed to obtain other film that was either a little more vague or produce their own as inexpensively as possible. As it was, what they showed looked like a typical night on CNN.Now, about the movie itself...the first thing that I found vastly disturbing about this movie is the ""I don't know factor."" While in the first ""Dawn of the Dead"" (which in my opinion was one of the best horror movies ever made) didn't give you a clear reason as to *why* the dead were getting up and walking, this ""Dawn"" did a much larger injustice to the viewer by touching on what could have been construed as a reason for the virus, but not elaborating. The movie begins in a hospital with a doctor and nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) talking about a patient with a virus. When the nurse goes to find the patient later, he is in ICU, with no clear reason as to why, when he wasn't in serious condition when he was brought in. Then she simply leaves the hospital and that is that. Nothing more. Did this patient start the virus? The next thing that I found totally disappointing was the in-continuity of the dying. As with all zombie movies, if you are bit, you die, it is just a matter of time.Now, the first woman who is brought to the mall after the people show up in the panel truck, she had been bitten (no clear time is given, could have been days, could have been hours, I am *assuming* hours) and she was dying. She died, came back, etc. Now, later on in the movie, Andy (the character that Ving Rhames befriends who is on top of his gun shop a ways away from the mall, and they ""talk"" via binoculars, and reading boards that they write messages on) gets bitten while trying to get something to eat and in mere minutes he is dead! Is this supposed to reflect the virus becoming more serious and stronger than it was originally? Maybe, but once again, that is a *big* stretch to ask the movie viewer to make when the writers gave no indication of such a progression. Now, the pregnant lady with the bite that looked more like a scratch and it took days and possibly a week(once again, no time line is readily established) for her to die, that made sense, as she didn't have a ""bite"" mark, it was more like a deep gash made by a tooth. Now, as for the rest of the movie and either the editors', the writers' or the director's short sightedness, I will touch upon that here. Now, to start...when the movie begins, the neighbor girl, Vivian comes into the house owned by Ana and her husband, as she and Ana are obviously friends...but *how* did she get into their house? It was the next morning, and Ana and her husband were asleep in their beds! When you see the door later, there is no obvious sign of trauma to it, meaning that Vivian walked right in. I don't think so.Now, on to the next scene. Vivian kills Ana's husband and he dies, then comes back and goes after Ana. She gets out of the house and goes to her car, where her dead husband proceeds to jump on the hood and nearly put his hand through the windshield of the car. OK, if *he* by himself was able to nearly break through Ana's windshield, then why couldn't an entire host of the undead break through people's doors, yet it seemed like none were. People *seemed* to be safe in their houses. That was never made clear either. Next is Andy, the poor gun shop owner, who while is one hell of a shot, he takes no provisions to his rooftop with him. Now, growing up around guns, hunting and being quite a shot myself, I can tell you that owning a gun shop in times of the undead walking would be quite handy but...there are things in gun shops, that not all, but *most* gun shops carry, that are not just guns. Most gun shops cater to hunters in one form or another, carrying *some* camping supplies and MRE's (Meals Ready to Eat)or protein bars at the very least. I have grown up around enough hunters to know, that when you are watching for that perfect buck, while sitting 20 feet up in a tree, you are not going to jump down and take time to hit McDonalds for a burger and fries. Now, why Andy didn't have *some* foodstuffs is beyond me. He nearly starves to death on top of a roof and then dies anyway while trying to get food.Now as for the end of the movie...does everyone die or not? I watched and watched and absolutely could not figure out if everyone dies or if they are still trying to get the zombies away from them so they can get back to the boat and get away. Top that off with the unnecessary tit shots (not just guys watch horror movies you know?) and I just think that this movie could have been so much more than it was.",Dawn of the Dead
160,Jacques98,Uninspiered.,1,2 September 2008,"Am I really the first negative review for this movie on here? That's pathetic.It was just stale.The beginning brought my level of hope for this movie up pretty high, and the sleek new zombies were pretty amazing. When the zombie action and scare scenes actually happened, there were simply some of the best I've seen on film.Too bad action and scares only happened for 20% of the movie, and even that might be a little high. The majority of this film was just stale, boring dialog with some comedy thrown in. I thought the comedy bits were pretty well-done, but they didn't fit. At all. I think the scariest part of this entire movie is the main menu.I just can't give this movie a positive rating because I've seen this movie done before a hundred timesbut done right. Parts of the movie reminded me of Cloverfeild, which kept the mood and setting without the pointless dialog. Parts reminded me of the video game Dead Rising, which had complete and total zombie mayhem and massacre, whereas this movie didn't come close.I'm not even sure this was worth watching once because it is so dull.0/10",Dawn of the Dead

And the most important question: will anyone CARE? I really, REALLY don't understand what to make of this movie; it isn't scary, it isn't suspenseful, it has characters I don't give a damn whether they live or die (and in some cases, like Ana's, really hope to see them die), it has way too much gore and is riddled with clichés.It's a movie to give to Joel, Mike and the 'bots.What I'm happy of, is that while the original will always stand tall, this remake has already been forgotten after two years of it being out.The only saving grace (and reason why I didn't sell my DVD) is the mock-newscast; I felt more for that newscaster than how I felt for the entire cast of this crap movie.So, in short; there are good remakes, after all.But this one is not.Dawn Of The Dead (2004): 1/10.",Dawn of the Dead
163,geminiredblue,Bloody Good Remake!!!,9,19 June 2013,"Normally I'm stand-offish towards remakes. Usually it seems when filmmakers decide to remake a classic, what they're really saying is ""The original sucks in some way. So now I'll do it better."" And 9 times out of 10, the remake is worse. Filmmakers of a good remake however say ""The original is excellent and we're not going to mess with it. Let's set it to one side. Now here's our version!"" In many ways, a good remake is an alternate story. DAWN OF THE DEAD is an example of a remake that is done very well. Taking the same basic concept as Romero's 1978 classic, director Zack Snyder and his team create their own frightening zombie film.The story: For nurse Ana (played wonderfully by Sarah Polley) her rough day at the hospital is finally winding down. All she wants to do is go home and fall into the arms of her husband. On her ride home, kids are playing, birds are chirping, music is blaring out of her radio. Just another normal day comes to an end... Next morning, in one of the best scary scenes in recent cinema history, she's attacked and must flee her home. Shortly afterward, she meets up with Kenneth (Ving Rhames) along with several other survivors. With nowhere else to go, they head to the enormous Crossroads Mall. And the rest of the story involves their struggle to survive in a zombie-infested world. There are so many individual scenes and gory special effects that I wouldn't think of revealing them all. Everything from the witty, sarcastic dialogue to the fleshed-out characters work together. Does it improve on the original? No, the original is still the best. However, it does make a wonderful companion piece. So if you want to have a double feature, go ahead and watch them both. Also, if you're not satisfied with the ""happy ending"", stay through the end credits!",Dawn of the Dead

This remake felt more like an action film than horror because it didn't really scare me but that didn't hurt the movie. The action sequences most involving the character being killed in gruesome ways by the zombies or vise-versa are well executed. The zombies did look terrifying and were fast too but you could help but get this feeling you've seen before. The effect worked none the less though. There was a little suspense but the ending was a bit predictable. Despite some flaws Dawn Of The Dead really isn't that bad of a movie because it's sure to please any die hard fan of the genre.

The moronic security guards at the mall who forces a pregnant Russian woman and her husband to urinate somewhere besides the bathroom, the clever betrayal of one of them, and the man who looks like the guy from My Name is Earl turning good, it's pretty clever. And if you enjoy the occasional humor in a horror movie, knock yourself out with a brick, because there is some in here. Ever wanted to see a zombie that looks like Jay Leno shot?

169,meathookcinema,A worthy remake of the original masterpiece,7,19 October 2020,"A remake of the much loved and revered masterpiece Dawn of the Dead was always going to be sneered at by fans and film scholars alike when the project was announced.I actually saw the film on it's release when I was visiting Glasgow and was expecting to roll my eyes constantly whilst saying 'Psst!' under my breath a few hundred times (but not too loudly...) during the film's running time. I was pleasantly surprised though. Whilst it was no worthy competition for Romero's original film in terms of it's coveted place in horror history, it was far from mediocre. In fact, it was really rather good!The opening scenes show central character Ana finish a long shift as a nurse at her local hospital and return home. The next day a little girl from her neighbourhood comes into her house and shows that all it not well. She has changed into a zombie and fatally attacks her partner, ripping out a chunk of his neck with her teeth. Very quickly, he then springs back to life and also in a zombiefied state like the girl who attacked him.Ana gets to her car and we then see that the very fabric of society has broken down almost completely. People are either dead and running around as zombies and trying to kill others, or they are still human but have either gone completely crazy (witness Ana's neighbour armed with a gun) or are in 'survival of the fittest' mode with no regard for anyone else around them (someone attempts to hijack Ana's car by trying to jump into it).After running off the road, Ana crosses paths with cop Kenneth who, with other characters (one of them pregnant!), goes to the neighbouring mall for refuge.The mall is where the majority of the rest of the movie takes place just like the original. There's even a nod to the first film with a sign for a shop called Gaylen Ross. The theme of a crisis bringing out the best and worst in a person's character is explored well here with the security guards who are already in the shopping centre having marked it as their territory and only letting the new arrivals take refuge if they surrender their weapons and adhere to their rules and laws. This is very Lord of the Flies.The next day even more characters are interjected into the narrative by way of a delivery truck and we now have our cast in place for the rest of the film. And this is one of the major strengths for the remake and that is that the characters are so brilliantly sketched and well rounded. There is a fantastic diversity and range within the characters with some changing by the time of the film's conclusion so that our expectations are constantly being challenged and contradicted with seemingly vile people redeeming themselves and vice versa.The film also perceptively displays human relationships at work. On first arrival most of the characters rub along pretty well. But being in a confined space together soon causes divisions and differences to develop and flare up. The film soon becomes something akin to events in a season of Big Brother but with, obviously, more at stake.As well as great characterisation we also get great make up and effects. The special effects for the film were actually by the company owned by Heather Langenkamp aka Nancy Thompson from the Nightmare on Elm Street films! She should be very proud with the results as they are fabulous.Scott Reiniger, Ken Foree and Tom Savini from the original all get cameos well as the Gaylen Ross reference/homage.The zombies in this film move a lot faster than their blue-skinned counterparts from the original which massively divided fans with Romero himself saying that he didn't like this aspect. I personally think it doesn't really bother me as it's something new just like the film itself. There's also a new rule regarding the dead turning into zombies with there being a set time of a few seconds before the dead arise again. I thought this was also an interesting new aspect of this remake/reimagining.There is also some great humour in the movie also. Witness the 'Celebrity Squares' game that Kenneth plays with his gun shop buddy who is trapped on the roof of his business nearby. This also blossoms into a great moment of camaraderie and dare I say bromance between the two characters. Again, this echoes the same kind of relationship that Scott and Peter had in the original. I thought that it was great that this was reproduced in the remake.I have to say though that on watching this film again for this review after seeing it on it's original release brought diminishing returns this time around. It was almost like when you know what to expect with this remake half of the fun has gone.This remake will never come close to the original film. But on first viewing it was interesting, innovative and had some artistic merit. It's also a great rollercoaster ride that didn't make me roll my eyes once.",Dawn of the Dead

171,Toronto85,Dawn of the Dead,6,7 July 2013,"Dawn of the Dead tells the tale of zombies attacking a group of human survivors who take refuge inside a large shopping center. This is of course the remake to the amazing 1978 film by George A. Romero. While it has it's moments, this remake fails to match or surpass that original for a few reasons. Anyways, the movie begins with the world BEFORE the zombie invasion. We meet our ""main"" character Ana who is coming home from a shift at the hospital. She goes to bed with her husband and then is awoken to a little girl standing in the hallway. Yes, she is a zombie. It is a very tense and creepy opening scene. That's when the excitement begins and Ana takes herself to safety at the mall.Other than the fact that it's a zombie film and it's location is inside of a large shopping mall, the Dawn of the Dead remake is very different from the original (which I liked a lot). This one had a much bigger budget and a more well known cast, but wasn't as good as the 1978 version. It's a good movie but failed to surpass the original. I HATE the fact that zombies can run, it takes away from the eerie moments we witnessed in the original 'Dead' films. Them running does add some intensity to a few scenes, but it just isn't the same as the 1978 version.'Dawn of the Dead (2004)' does have some creepy moments, and of course has gore galore. But it doesn't have the same charm the original had. This should be seen by all horror/zombie fans as it is a good entry to the genre.6/10",Dawn of the Dead

Crap.,2,13 September 2006,"Wow, if there is ever a case for a movie which is completely pointless, useless, and a waste of everyone's time, it's King Kong 2005. Oh wait, wrong review. it's also 2004's ""Dawn of the Dead."" The new ""Dawn"" sucked on so many levels. It's yet another reason why most remakes should not be made. Poor direction, horrible script, bad actors, lame music...and this was supposed to be a remake of one of the greatest horror films ever made? It's like a joke.First of all, this wasn't scary at all. Horror means scary. You are supposed to be scared at a horror film. Nope. There was not a single instance in this film that was scary at all, none. Wasn't this the director's first film? Where'd they pick him up, eating lunch on 3rd street outside of NYU with all the other pretentious no-talents who attend there? Or did he save someone's life or something and being the director was his payback? Wow, the direction sucked.Second, the actors all sucked. The main black guy cop was a laugh riot. Trying to look tough, spurting out those badass lines...he was hysterical! So were the others for the most part, but he was the champ here.God, where to go from here...the music was a joke. The zombies all sucked. Running zombies suck. They looked OK here and there, but the running helps take away from the ""doomed"" atmosphere that was sorely lacking. I never felt there was the ""doom"" that the world was being taken over by the dead. Showing a million computer generated zombies doesn't do that, good film-making and direction does. So the zombies weren't scary, they were often pretty funny. The zombie baby was especially hilarious. So was the fat one chasing the blond in the mall.OK, let me be positive for a sec. There were only two whole good shots in the film - the little girl in the shadows in the house near the start, and one shot of the Russian woman as she's dead. That's it.Wow! It's a sex scene! Completely unneeded and out of place. Like most of the scenes probably.Some may say you can't compare this to the original. Why? Of course you can, it's the remake! The original is a classic because it had it all - great direction, scary atmosphere, decent soundtrack that added to the film, decent acting - unlike the new film which was poor on every level.What garbage. A complete waste of everyone's time. It really makes you wonder who is making these films these days and where they are learning their ""talent"" and craft. But hey. I'll end this on a positive note. I will say this about the film - as horrible as it was, it was better than ""28 Days.""

173,talisencrw,One of the best contemporary genre-classic remakes!,9,16 January 2016,"Though I love both 'Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole' and 'Watchmen', I actually think Snyder's remake of George A. Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' may be his finest and most personal work of the three. Usually I stay away from contemporary remakes of the classics like the plague, because to me, atmosphere is everything, and today's directors tend to significantly miss that point, but sometimes I just can't stop myself, and it helped that two recent character actors I really respect (fellow Canadian Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames) played significant roles. Though I still prefer the satirical angle on consumerism Romero utilized in his 70's original (and for that reason alone it would make a great double bill with 'Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom', at least from Pier Paolo Pasolini's philosophical context), this is head and shoulders (shot, of course, so it doesn't come back as a zombie) above other remakes of this era. I wish Snyder still had the sense of hunger that permeates this first film of his (pardon the pun ;) )...",Dawn of the Dead
174,general-melchett,A brilliant horror flick - a spiffing remake.,9,19 December 2006,"Dawn of the Dead is more than just a bloody zombie movie - it is a terrifying, gritty, strangely realistic depiction of an apocalyptic world. If something like this were ever to happen, this film is a troublingly-accurate portrayal of what people might do to help themselves. They would find whoever they could to join forces with, they would go somewhere they could survive in and stay safe and they would try to wait it out. But something would have to go wrong. And things do. Instead of being just a bunch of friendly, never-angry losers, our survivors whose adventures we follow in this flick are real people who have troubles, conflicts and fallouts, and also friendships and fun times that grow stronger in these desperate times.But enough of that, Dawn of the Dead wasn't made to disturb for ever after (though it probably will) - it was made to supply gore-loving hounds with lots of the red stuff. And there is sure lots of it in this film. Lots of exploding heads and flying blood are combined with furious fights and brutal plans. It is pretty amazing how all this was filmed on a $28,000,000 budget - they actually had to create a realistic-looking mall and have explosions, guns, saws and generally very bloody special effects. Most films would find this hard to do on a budget three times that size - but DOTD is very flexible with its rather small budget and none of it's shoddy either, providing us with a brilliant zombie flick that has actually been quite a success (a $100 million worldwide box office gross ain't terrible, but it should have done better).The film is brutally intense from the start - in about 30 seconds, we are thrown from peaceful suburban world into crazy zombie-infested hellhole. And the first 10 minutes are where the film really comes into its stride - by showing us how much things can change in so little a time. And from then onwards, it's gritty, bloody, and generally rough all the way. The goriest scene was when the zombie Andy had his head blown up by an 870 shotgun - it's the sort of thing that was made to be watched in slow motion. And with several other gory deaths and shootings, this film will not fail anyone who likes a bit of blood in their entertainment.Though the DVD release was slightly underwhelming (though the Region 2 edition had an absolutely brilliant news report feature), this is a great remake of an old classic and proves that zombies never get boring. Brilliant! 9/10",Dawn of the Dead
175,Alex-372,Pretty Good Genre Movie,8,25 August 2006,"DAWN OF THE DEAD starts of as Shawn Of The Dead 2, way too comical and off the cuff. However, once characters are established, the movie quickly becomes far more involving. Camera work is used very effectively to create tension. Tension is also helped by the fact that the characters aren't asked to do too many stupid things, which always undermines the credibility and tension of the movie - you start to figure they deserve whatever they get.The cast is excellent, from Sarah Polley (Go), to Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phiffer, the great Jake Weber (""Medium"", The Cell), Micheal Kelly and a very hot Kim Poirier (and born in the eighties too, how time flies). Sarah Polley alternatingly looks like Anna Faris and, for those of us who remember the eighties, Joanne Whalley (""Edge Of Darkness"").Even though the entire Zombie theme has been done to death, there are some very real improvements made in this movie, and some incoherences too. For instance, none of the survivors have seen a zombie movie before (which is odd, as they're starring in one). Also, they are in a mall - plenty of food and water, but no gun shop? No fresh clothes? An improvement over earlier versions is the sheer number of zombies. Odds are stacked against the main characters too, because the zombies only have to wound them, while they have to shoot them in the head or decapitate them. The zombies have also gone from lumbering corpses, to being able to run at full speed. They're still telekinetic, as thousands of them seem to detect the presence of live humans and congregate on their hideouts.Considering that the first zombie movie of the modern movie era, Night Of The Living Dead, was made in 1968 (when most of the actors were either in being born or unborn for years to come), the movie holds up pretty well, and is still a vehicle through which to examine modern society, as it was then. And of course it is impossible to watch this movie and not think of Hurricane Katrina, which struck a year after this movie was made.",Dawn of the Dead

177,CMRKeyboadist,Good Retelling Of A Classic,8,14 December 2005,"I will say right away, I HATE REMAKES OF CLASSIC FILMS, but this movie proved to be a really good movie and should not disappoint fans of the original. I saw this flick in the theaters the day it came out only because a good friend of mine talked me into it. I walked out of the theater and could not stop talking about how impressed I was. First of all, this movie is quite gory. Not as gory as the original but goes above and beyond for todays standards (which are pathetic). Plenty of head shots but no disembowelment scenes that made the original one a real gore fest. My main issue with the movie is characters. There are a few characters that you do really start to care for and a lot of characters you can't wait to see die. The owner of the gun shop in the movie you really grow to like and Ving Rhames character is reminiscent of Ken Foree's character in the original. Sara Polley did alright but I really didn't care to much for her character and same goes for the rest. The thing that they executed very well was the end of the movie which I won't say what happenins but it is very impressive. All in all, it was the best remake of a movie I have seen that I can think of and it's definitely worth watching. For people who have seen the original, look for cameo appearances by Tom Savini and Ken Foree. 8 stars",Dawn of the Dead
178,RockPortReview,A brilliant horror remake!,9,27 January 2011,"Dawn of the Dead (2004) 8/7/2010Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of the classic George A. Romero zombie movie ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a milestone in many ways. It helped launch Snyder's career and has since directed ""300"" and ""Watchmen"". ""Dawn"" is a spectacular remake, some say better that the original. It introduced us to the fast, sprinting zombies. It did however also help set in motion the trend of remaking every old horror they could dig up no matter how bad it is.""Dawn"" follows in the original films foot steps, but it also blazes its own trails too. When the zombie apocalypse is upon us, a group of survivors led by a nurse (Sarah Polley) and a cop (Ving Rhames) they find solace in The Crossroads Mall. This was a big statement in the original film, about the countries growing consumerism. Barricaded in the mall and surrounded by hordes of the undead, they must figure out a way to survive and come to terms with the fact that everybody they know and love is gone. ""When there is no more room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth"" This is a great line spoken by a preacher, just before the station goes off the air. As with most survival horror films, this group of diverse people must learn to work together if they want to survive. The acting and character development is quite good for a horror movie. You know these people and want them to survive. As I mentioned earlier, the classic images of slow moving zombies has been given a serious makeover. These flesh eating freaks are like Olympic sprinters, making them a frightening real threat. The make up effects and CG and very well done for most part, and the gore makes it well worth the price of the unrated DVD. This movie is literally unstoppable as it continues in snippets right though the end credits.Zack Snyder's vision and filmmaking sense is just what this generations needs. With ""300"" being another monumental hit, he seems to have a bright, limitless career. Please, please don't be another M. Night Shyamalan.",Dawn of the Dead
179,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Dawn of the Dead (2004),8,27 October 2007,"One of the best zombie movies ever!!!!!Dawn of the dead was of the best zombie movie ever. There was a couple of unexpected faces in there. I didn't expect Jake Weber (who i know from Medium)to be in this movie. The violence was out of control which is what you would expect from a zombie movie.There are a few funny moments and a lot of zombie attacking, bullet through the head, blood going everywhere moments in in. The running zombies are much better then the slow groaning zombies because it makes the movie much better because it makes it harder for the survivors to get away which makes the movie more heart pounding.This is a great guy movie. There may be a hand full of girls out there who will like this movie(like me)and be able to stand the gore and blood. The story begins with Ana, a nurse who notices many weird things happening inside and outside of the hospital. When the zombies hit her house she flees and finds other survivors who take cover in the mall. I thought the dog was great(when you see the movie you will know what i am talking about)it was so cute and was a little bit of a hero.I recommend this movie to every soul on the planet. If you can't stand blood and gore then don't see this movie. It is the best zombie movie along with Shawn of the dead.8/10",Dawn of the Dead
180,pinkliz41,A remake to die for!,8,22 February 2008,"This remake of the George A Romero cult zombie slasher contains everything a remake should. For this day and age it's hard to remake a film and to pull it off to make it as good as the original. In this case it quite literally succeeds immensely. Beware that this film contains pervasive strong bloody violence, horror and strong language. Moving off the MPAA rating you are delivered with not only a normal shoot em up zombie film, but also with a film that thrives the characters emotions and characteristics that have not been shown in a zombie film for quite some time. The story and plot are really well made, the cast could not have been a better assemble and the homage to the zombie/action/thriller category could not be surpassed.",Dawn of the Dead
181,gogoschka-1,"A Non-Stop Thrill Ride With Pitch-Black Humor, A Great Cast And Excellent Makeup Effects",8,11 May 2020,"I'm a Romero nut (for those among you who don't know the name George A. Romero: that was the genius writer/director who single-handedly created the modern zombie film and who also wrote and directed the original 'Dawn of the Dead' in '78), so you may believe me when I say I wasn't impressed when I heard there would be a remake of the zombie maestro's famed horror classic. Truth be told, I was absolutely determined to hate this new film when it came out - but boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise!As it turned out, Zack Snyder's remake isn't just a re-hash of Romero's film but offers a very different take on the material and deserves to be recognized based on its own merits as one of the most entertaining entries in the particular horror sub-genre that is the zombie film. The James Gunn script is hilariously funny throughout - in a pitch black kind of way - and there is simply not a dull moment in it.Furthermore, the cast consists of great character actors who are totally game (Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Michael Kelly and Ty Burrell among others); the gore effects are insane and the zombie makeup is the best pre-'Walking Dead' in any zombie movie by far. I'm inclined to believe that had this film been made by a less divisive director than Snyder, it would have since gone on to be regarded a B-movie horror classic for the ages.It's true that the scathing social commentary which elevated the original ""Dead Trilogy"" above simple gore-fests is largely absent from the remake, but I don't see this as a flaw in the new film. The political subtext in Romero's films was effective in part because it was so subversive at the time; a remake repeating those same beats more than two decades later simply wouldn't have the same impact (which Romero himself actually went on to prove with his far from bad but oddly dated ""New Dead trilogy"" consisting of 'Land of the Dead' (2005), 'Diary of the Dead' (2007) and 'Survival of the Dead' (2009) ).What 'Dawn of the Dead (2004) does brilliantly instead is focus on the characters. Every single player in the remake is fun to watch; even the supporting characters are colorful and more than ""one-note"" and have their own arcs. I would also like to point out that while Gunn's script is lighter on social commentary than Romero's, it's far from dumb, and the story beats are interesting and unpredictable enough to keep you invested throughout.To sum it all up: While I love Romero's film for its clever subtext and critique of consumerism, its impact on the horror genre and its entertainment value, I love Snyder's version for the pitch black humor, the great cast as well as the pure spectacle and non-stop thrill-ride it provides. As far as action-horror films go, it actually doesn't get much better than this: Dawn Of The Dead '04 is simply an A+ genre flick that deserves to get more recognition.About this review: tastes in film obviously vary greatly, so if you want to get a better reference if mine generally aligns somewhat with yours, I created a list of my 50 favorite films on my imdb page which should leave you in no doubt about what kind of stuff I'm into (just click on my name if you're interested).",Dawn of the Dead
182,ozjeppe,If a remake HAD to be made- this is how to!,6,5 July 2004,"Furiously paced and grittily filmed, this remake of 1978 genre classic is strikingly effective, with characters needfully restrained. The apocalyptic atmosphere is immediate and riveting. And thank you for technical film-making improvement- no tomato soup- blood, here. Still, the 1978 original haunts me differently, with its slow-moving zombies and pastel images. There the message of human wallowing in the shopping mall materialist excess also lingers longer: Once knowing you could die the next hour, wouldn't YOU be tempted to do the same thing? But hey, why compete? They're two completely different films, and equally enjoyable. But the kinetic breakout scene here is simply stunning, and the episode with Andy the rooftop gunman provides the most memorable human element. 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",Dawn of the Dead
183,erwan_ticheler,"Excellent remake,but 1978 is superior",8,15 May 2004,"SPOILERS:This is an excellent remake of the 1978 horror classic,especially when you consider the trash that comes nowadays in the horror genre.I had my doubts about it because I really love the original movie and remakes are not my favorite movies.This movie proved my wrong though since the pace and storyline are very good.In this comment I will compare the two movies and give my opinion on the changes and so forth: - First of all the dialogue,which is in both movies very cool although I think that the original has got the better lines and facial expressions that go with it. - Romero vs. Snyder is no contest but who knows in the future what we will hear from Snyder? The acting is superior in the original as are the characters.It is funny to see that the names of the characters have completely changed but the looks and appearances have somehow stayed intact. -The actors in the 2004 version are not famous except for the always cool Ving Rhames,inevitably he's my favorite character of the movie! It is nice to see that Zack Snyder used several actors of the original in cameo roles, there is Tom Savini(biker and make-up artist in 1978) as a sheriff,Scott H. Reiniger(Roger in 1978) as a general and Ken Foree(Peter in 1978 and my favorite character in the movie) as the televangelist.Just like Romero in 1978,Snyder also appears in his version. - Both movies have a pregnant woman in it,although I have to say that it's importance is not big in 1978 while it is very important(and gory,haha) in 2004. - What has been enhanced in the 2004 version is the intro and the end credits which are simply brilliant.While 1978 has a rather dull yet important intro 2004 begins with a bang.The end credits are really great with the video camera shootings during the credits. DON'T GO AWAY RIGHT AFTER THE MOVIE HAS FINISHED,CAUSE IT HASN'T!!! - The ending of 2004 (during the credits) is at an ""deserted"" island,in 1978 there is a conversation between out heroes and some police officers who are talking about going to such an island,just a minor detail yet it has probably been copied. - Very significant is the speed of the Zombies,as they are slow and almost slapstick like in 1978 they are very fast in 2004.Yet,the mindlessness of the Zombies remains the same in both movies and so it should be. - It has to be said that the humour in he original is superior to the remake.But has got a lot to do with the story and critical point of view of the original.Yet the scenes with Andy,who lives across the street from the mall,are really funny.Especially the ""kill the celebrity"" sequence! - The tagline of both movies ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"" is used in both movies and both times it is spoken out by Ken ""Peter"" Foree;Well done,Zack Snyder! - There is a scene in a weapons store in the 1978 version,which is very important since it provides our heroes the necessary armour.This has been copied in 2004 yet it has changed into a private weapons depot in Andy's house, Ving Rhames' buddy across the street from the mall.Both movies have the same Zombie contamination (both after bites from the Zombie).That means that also the killing of infected heroes is the same,one scene is copied although not with the same character.The scene in 1978 in which Roger becomes a Zombie has been copied in 2004 although now it has become a dirty fat woman.Yet the same camera technique and tension has been used. - The story is far better in 1978,the social comment of the original is not very present in 2004.Yet,the same mall has been used.Only in 1978 there is more attention to mass consumption (Francine about the mall:""What are they doing? Why do they come here? Stephen: Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives."") than in 2004 which is wise to some extent since the audience nowadays doesn't seem to want those comments in horror movies.I really enjoyed it though in the original,even if it takes some time to explain it visually.(the 1978 version is over 2 hours while the 2004 version is about 90 minutes long) - The soundtrack of the original is massive and really cool.The synthesizer like noise really gives an extra dimension to it and therefore I appreciate the original on this point.Yet,the ""mall muzak"" remains the same in both. - The addition in 1978 of the bikers has totally vanished in the remake. A pity since I really liked those sequences.Those were also the most gory sequences in the original and therefore also makes the original champion on that point.Of course there is some gore in the remake,but not as good and cheap as in the original. - Both movies have a ""bad"" ending which makes both movies even better than they already are,of course the original was a second edition of a trilogy while the remake stands on it's own.Two other things:I really enjoyed the ""A-Team,let's build an armoured car"" sequence.Of course Ving Rhames used the blow torch. Another funny thing for me as a Dutchman was to see the actor Jake Webber who is a complete look a like of our nation's football goalie Edwin van der Sar.Overall I have to say that the remake is a great horror film and would be the greatest Zombie movies ever yet the original and ""Night of the Living Dead (1968)"" are classics in the genre and I truly love those two.Both are in my horror top 10. Still,the 2004 version is a very good movie and deserves the credit of a very crafty and exciting horror.2004: 8/101978: 9/10 (currently number 73 in my all time top 100 list)",Dawn of the Dead

185,lotus_chief,A new level of stupidity has been attained....,1,28 March 2004,"***SPOILERS BELOW!***I went into this flick knowing what to expect.  Horror movie.  Okay, silly people doing stupid things with some gore and mindless killing.  Fine, I'm a fan of horror flicks when they're done right; last year's Freddy vs. Jason was pretty good.  I don't think I've ever been more disgusted at a movie than I am with Dawn of the Dead.  Granted, I haven't seen the original so I can't compare it to this 'remake'.  But a new level of stupidity has been attained with DOD.  The movie started out pretty good - the way the 'calm ordinary day' to 'utter chaos and insanity' switch was shown was very well done.  I'll admit, it had me hooked.  However, the movie quickly went deeper and deeper into pure stupidity.  I can suspend my disbelief but so far, but this is too much!  They can't be serious:The girl takes one of the few remaining trucks and risks her life and the life of all the other survivors to save 'Chips'...a stupid dog she's only known for a day or so?  And what was up with these idiots waiting until 'infected' people died and turned into zombies to kill them?  How stupid can you be????  How stupid was Mekhi Phifer?  He actually thought his baby was going to be normal?  He knew what he was doing was wrong, or else why did he have his wife tied to the bed?  He knew EXACTLY what was happening (his wife was bitten and was going to turn), yet he gets mad at the old lady and kills her because she had sense to kill his now-zombie wife - saying 'you're threatening my family?'  WHAT???  Your wife is a ZOMBIE you idiot!  LMAO! What the HELL were the writers thinking with this CRAP??  What was the point of them wheeling in the fat dying lady?  She was no use to anyone anyway and she was bitten...KILL HER!  And Ana, she's seen all that has gone on - when someone is bitten it's only a matter of time before they 'die' and become a zombie.  So why o why is she pleading with Michael to come along with them on the boat where they're SAFE, saying she could 'help him', knowing he's going to turn?  Just HOW IN THE HELL did she intend on 'helping him'?? The stupidity of this movie truly knew no bounds, and this is what ultimately kills it.As I said earlier I'm a fan of horror movies; Halloween, Friday the 13th, Freddy flicks are among my favorites.  So I know what these movies are like and expect silliness (i.e. a chick laying down and blood drops on her from above and she asks 'where is this coming from'?? lol).  But DOD is on another level as far as stupidity goes.  I could not have watched the same film as everyone else, because my friends and I were all disgusted with this joke of a 'horror' flick..and yet it gets all these good reviews.  There's absolutely NO character depth (didn't expect much to begin with) and the plot is beyond brainless - we don't even find out how/why all of this is happening.  DOD is complete NONSENSE; a disgrace of a movie that tries to be a 'horror' flick (I don't even count as one since it isn't the least bit scary).  What a pathetic waste of time & money.  28 Days Later is FAR superior; anyone who says otherwise is deluding themselves.½* out of **** stars.  What could have been....",Dawn of the Dead
186,MF210,So completely different from the Original,8,8 November 2004,"My Rating: *** out of ****. Last year, A classic horror film called the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was remade. Although it was not critically acclaimed, I thought it was a solid horror film and a damn good remake. The same could be said for this years Dawn of the Dead. However, the remake of TCM could at least be called similar to the original. In the 2004 Dawn of the Dead, its like a complete reimagination. There almost different movies. Yes, the plot is basically the same but there's a lot different here too. For example, the zombies move much faster, it takes place in Wisconsin (not Pennsylvania), and the film plays out in a much different way. The setting of a shopping mall is the same but here its only used as a place to hide where in the original it was used George Romero's brilliant(if not very subtle) satire on consumerism. So how does this Dawn fare against the older one? It holds up but it is inferior to the original. Romero's Dawn of the Dead was a horror film mixed with satire, this Dawn is more like action and horror. Thats not a bad thing because it works but Romero's Dawn was more challenging to a viewer. It was an intelligent horror film and while its not fair to call this film dumb, its nowhere near as intelligent as Romero's film was. That being said, this Dawn does a few things better than the original. First of all the look of the zombies is far more scary, the make-up is more realistic, and in some ways, this is a scarier film. Also, the zombies move much faster here which adds more tension to the film. First-time director Zach Snyder does an excellent job of raising tension throughout the film.However, you can tell this guy used to do music videos. Although this Dawn has a more polished, slicker look to it than the original did, there are times, especially in the beginning, when it looks a little too much like a music video. Is this a bad thing? Well it is a little distracting but it doesn't last too long (it looks much more like a movie in the mall).The acting does not disappoint though. Everyone in the cast does a solid job portraying their character. If there's a problem here, its that I liked the characters in the original Dawn better. They seemed more accessible and likable to me. In this film some characters come across as really selfish or just plain stupid. For instance, would you risk going to save a dog in a building that is not only surrounded by zombies but has one in it? And not even have a weapon with you? I mean even though that moment was very suspenseful it fell back to the horror movie standard that a character must do something totally idiotic. Also, what is the big deal with the ending of this film? All I heard was the ending is the most horrifying part of the film. Are you joking? I could see that coming so it wasn't shocking at all. The opening 10 minutes were far more effective. Another minor thing bothered me in this film and it was the use of the line ""When there is no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth"". As we all know this is from the original and once again delivered by Ken Foree. However, it didn't feel right here, it felt liked it was tacked on to make a reference to the original. It doesn't have the same impact either. Why? Because in the original Foree's character mentioned something about voodoo to go along with the line, here its just randomly said on television. How the hell is that creepy?For the most part, this Dawn of the Dead delivered. It has flaws but it is tightly-paced, graphic and yes, scary. In my opinion, its much better than the overrated 28 Days Later. While it isn't on the same level as the original, it works on its own.",Dawn of the Dead
187,pumaye,Really good way to go,8,29 March 2004,"This updated remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead is deliriously fun to watch. Boys, these zombies run!! And they are really fast too!! Very gory, very bloody, very graphical in its depictions of death (and even of birth, I should add), this movie doesn't slow down a minute, it is full of pleasant surprises, and even if not scary (but which American horror movie can be considered scary since Psycho? Really a few, perhaps none), it is a pleasure to run through, being full of silly gags, gory ones indeed, unrealistic characters (but who cares?) that are fun to watch even when they die.

They try to handle this problem with hundreds and thousands of headshots but that make things even worse.",Dawn of the Dead
189,Ronin47,Very good remake of my all-time favorite film (***1/2),9,28 March 2004,"There's no other way to start this review than to state that George A. Romero's original, 1978 masterpiece ""Dawn Of The Dead"", about 4 survivors of a zombie plague setting up house in an empty shopping mall, is my favorite movie of all time. I remember the first time I saw it like it was yesterday.
A lot of the other fans of the original were upset at the idea of this remake, but I was excited. I'm not a purist, so as long as the makers paid respect to the original and made a good-enough movie that wasn't TOO stupid, I'd be happy. Well, I couldn't be happier to tell you that unlike the lame botch-job that was the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake, this ""Dawn..."" remake met my expectations...and then some. Technically, it's not being called a ""remake"" but rather a ""re-envisioning"", because the characters and sequence of events are quite different. I didn't mind this, because it's far more interesting to see a reworking of a theme than an exact remake, and there is lots of interesting ground left to cover in Romero's brilliantly imagined post-apocalyptic society.
After the unexplained plague hits and proceeds to turn all of society upside down within a matter of hours, a few survivors, which include a nurse (great indie actress Sarah Polley), a cop (Ving Rhames), and a young man (Mekhi Phifer) with his very pregnant Russian girlfriend (Inna Korobkina), head to the local mall looking for shelter. Once they lock the entrances and it's clear that no help is coming, they proceed for a while to build a new life in the shopping mall. It's a fascinating concept, building an insulated, miniature utopian society inside this giant mall, while just outside, the whole world is crumbling.
The problem, though, is that there are far too many characters in this one. In the original, there were only four, and as a result they were each extremely well developed. Here, there's at least 15 people in the mall, and many of them seem to be just filling space. Though it's true that Romero's smart social commentary takes a backseat here to hard-driving action scenes, this is still a very tough and intelligent film. A few other critics and I picked up on an eerie, distinctly post-9/11 vibe, the idea of living in a burned-out, post-apocalyptic America (an American flag makes an ironic appearance near the end). Hmm, maybe the zombies are George W. Bush's followers? Ultimately, writer James Gunn and director Zack Snyder have gone out of their way to make a really fine film here, and it shows. They don't stray far from Romero's vision or dumb-down the material, they retained much of his dark humor, they assembled a quality cast, and included several clever cameos and in-jokes for those of us familiar with the original.
So it's not Romero, but it's still a hell of a good time.And be sure not to arrive late. The first 10 minutes of this film (which includes what is bar none the best opening credits sequence I've seen in years), make for a powerful experience all their own.",Dawn of the Dead
190,jdollak,A mixed blessing,8,2 November 2004,"I've been hesitant to write a review for this film, as I had to wait for it to become available on DVD to get a chance to see it a few more times. I love the dead films. This one has a special spot, as it is not an improvement really, but it isn't worse than the original either. The debate over slow v fast dead, about how this isn't really much of a remake...all of that is valid, but it doesn't wind up contributing to how good the movie is. Dead movies are not about how good they are in the traditional sense. It's more about thinking through the scenario, considering what you would do in these situations. There are a few weaknesses which make me dislike the movie. Some sequences move a little slow, which is partly because of the 90s style horror script. Characters are too witty, and in an effort to be 'realistic,' the negative traits are made to be overwhelmingly obvious. Please - despite what you've heard, horror fans would like complex characters, especially if their deaths in a film are going to mean anything. And the ending during the credits left a bad taste in my mouth. By leaving a definitive ending, it destroys the creative audience opportunity to speculate. Some of the MTV-style direction is annoying. Some of it works effectively, notably during the opening credits. It's a good watch, especially if you are a fan of the genre. Otherwise, one could take or leave it.",Dawn of the Dead

192,Jakealope,"Nothing Tops the Original, But in an Age of Lame Remakes",9,18 October 2006,"This one is 1000x as good as the current spate of remakes of classics like the ""Hills Have Eyes"" or the ""Omen"" which is so derivative, why bother. Face it, Romero's original DotD was the greatest movie ever made, no debate. This movie can't reach that mark, of course. But Zach wisely recycled old zombie motifs, characters and settings but came up with something good and original.Don't worry, there are tons of great zombie head shots, and I ain't referring to cameras. There is the coward, Steve, who screws the rest. There is the big black guy, Ken, who is tough, but isn't good at organizing. Mike is the main character: one of life's losers who has a good way with people and can foresee danger and new approaches, besides having a conscience. Ana, Sara Polley is cute and tough, but not like one of today's psycho woman Rambos. She is emotional and sensitive but understands that this ugly new reality requires extreme measures, which she learns to take. Besides, she brightens up the screen a bit. There is the bad-ass security guard CJ, who after his little tyranny is overthrown, becomes a tough fighter. By far, CJ has the best lines and pretty funny in his tough guy way;""You can take your ass over to the Quality Inn if it's still there, Shaq! "". Throw Andre, some black hustler, his pregnant Russian wife Luda, and a scrappy working class pair, a few girls and a Matt Frewer cameo, and you have a basic Canadian ensemble type of casting. Of course, the usual references to the original: ""tv spots"" by Scott Reninger, Ken Foree and Tom Savini(who recreates the sheriff from Night), Qualpeco truck, and Gaylen Ross boutique and you can see that Zach acknowledges his master. It is more serious than the original, without the zombie as consumer theme. The action scenes are great, but I could live without the slow motion shots of spent shell casings hitting the floor. Also, his zombies are speed freaks, not the lumbering, kinda harmless looking ones you'd expect. His one great scene of horror, the shootout with the crazy hustler and the truck driving woman which leads to the discovery of the newly born zombie baby. That was true horror with a minimum of gore. But Romero's low budget classic used a real mall and got real firemen, soldiers and cops to help out for free. His little crew worked for next to nothing. Though it is crude by today's cgi, it's semi guerrilla movie look is endearing. While this one, hardly a huge budget, has all the gloss the old one lacked, as well as having some good B level actors like Mekhi Phifer, Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley. a must for any horror buff, an absolute necessity for a zombie fan and a remake that won't hurt or upset any fans of the original.",Dawn of the Dead
193,utahman1971,What is wrong with fake gore? Love this movie!,10,29 October 2017,"I cannot understand the hate of fake gore. People say it is unnecessary but it is really necessary. All the movies without it are unnecessary, because it is part of horror but not all of horror for a movie. Cutting it out is just basically turning it into a thriller.Irritating to hear someone claim they are a horror fan but can't stand the fake gore. WTH? Do not ever call yourself a horror fan, if you have to only watch movies without gore. Argument never stands with saying there is no need for the fake gore.From start to finish, this is an awesome gory zombie movie. Anyone that keeps talking smack about gore, just is not all there in the head. You could say the for me, that likes it. Well, I do not consider a horror movie without it a horror movie.This movie starts in a hospital and a nurse working, then after work goes home to her husband, but while at work a patient is taken with a bite. Turns out we don't know what is going on until she gets home and hangs out with her husband and has sex, she takes a shower and sleeps at night.In the morning is when hell breaks loose with zombies getting more and more coming. All of a sudden her husband is attack by a kid next door biting him and turning him into one, and then she leaves with her husband trying to attack her.The rest just gets more interesting. You can watch it for yourselves. It is awesome, and for the fake gore haters. Just keep in your PG-13 club, and all the real horror fans will enjoy the real actual horror movies.",Dawn of the Dead

195,tequila101,Intesnesly Great,8,14 December 2010,"The Dawn of the Dead remake would have to be one of my favorite remakes because it is very chaotic, I love the carnage and the film's premises lie on disturbance.At many moments I found the film very, very disturbing. Zack Synder had really put a lot of effort into the remake. his remake also starts off on some happy little slope and then when we see the girl who's a zombie, then we all know that it's gonna get better from there.I like how Zack keeps the film's plot on the exact same story line where there are many survivors trapped in a Mall and that there are Zombies trying to get in. It was great to see that the elements of this great adaptation can be compared to George A. Romero's classic so well.I also like how there were more survivors this time round and it was excellent to see that we could all see what each survivor was going through. Some where determined to get out of this mess, some where stubborn and one was just an idiot. But it was great to have a variety of smart and dumb-witted characters.There were also many sad moments in this film that really left me disturbed and I'm not going to spoil it.Overall it doesn't fall short off of Romero's Classic Dawn of the Dead, having a chaotic situation, fast zombies, different varieties of characteristics & tones of weapons. It is my second favorite Remake and anyone who hasn't seen it yet, see it... 8/10",Dawn of the Dead
196,jrfranklin01,Strangely Funny,6,7 February 2005,"For a horror flick, someone definitely had to be having a bit of fun with this one. We all pretty much know this story from the original and it's sequels, in which a bunch of people are turned into zombies and begin eating other people. What made this version unique was its gore (way up there) and some of the comedic scenes. In this film we (SPOILER) even get a zombie baby! Our ""heroes"" are shacked up in a mall most of the film with Ving Rhames as Mr. Macho, playing a weird game of ""Shoot the Celebrity Look-Alike Zombie"" from the mall's rooftop. They stay there so long that people start making their own homes out of each store and begin forming relationships (the scene with the couple and the store video camera is ridiculously funny). In fact, that would describe much of this movie, except for the fact we have to take it somewhat seriously just due to the amount of blood and gore (much like Cabin Fever). Don't expect a happy ending in this one (remember ""Return of the Living Dead""?). If you watch the ending credits, you'll get a bit of Blair-Witch-type footage which is pretty good. 6/10",Dawn of the Dead

As if this counts! Don't you people watch horror movies?!!!! I have watched hundreds of them and rarely do protagonists make it at the end! It's always the villain and when they do, remember the villains keep coming back! As much as I've seen movies where heroes die at the end, I started to feel like ""hollywood endings"" don't exist anymore, that's if they ever did! It truly repulses and wards me off when people say I didn't like this movie because the hero won!!!! or when they don't understand a movie which might be because the movie is rubbish, they just think it should be clever because they were stupid enough to not to understand it like the majority did with ""Eden Log"" !!!! So, back to this piece of art. It's beautiful and full of details that will make you enjoy every single second of the movie.

199,rcavellero,REMAKES RULE GENRE TERRITORY!,9,19 March 2004,"I have to tell you after watching the stupid teaser for this film my expectations weren't very high. And although the trailer kicked major ass I still had doubts on wheather it would even be a mediocre film, it didn't have much going for it. A brand new commerical director, a big studio, a remake of a (in my opinion) passable flaky classic.  And even after meeting the cast at the Fango Convention in January, I got a little amped to see it but still had my doubts. All of those doubts have been put to rest today. Following the same logic as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake this is more of a reimagining borrowing the basic ideas and updating for our times. Dawn of the Dead isn't just a good film, it's a great one. And a landmark genre picture at that. It follows the basic setup of the strangers meeting at a local mall, where they fend off hordes of zombies while trying to indulge themselves in an acceptable lifestyle. Only for the horrors of the world surrounding them to come crashing in. And boy do they do. The film boasts some of the most imaginative death sequences seen in a while and captures the overall dread and horror brought forth by the source material. Unlike it's simplistic and over hyped predecessor this film remains entertaining while staying respectful, clever and scary. It also helps that the film is fueled by taut direction, good performances especially from new horror heroine Sarah Polley and believable charachter growth and story development. The effects are also over the top, grotesque and very creative.  However the only way the film falls short is in the way that it doesn't match Chainsaw's story telling or overall intensity. But this film is definatly a new horror classic, the new generation can embrace and the old genration can treasure. One thats respectful to a genre fan's needs and yet can overcome critical stabs and remain succesful. Dawn of the Dead is just another example of how Remakes are beginning to rule genre territory and new flicks are just seemingly falling flat. Their are many reasons to cherish this film cinematograoghy, hilarious soundtrack choices, an intensly scary tone, great spfx, good story, believable performances, expert direction but the one main reason to go see it is that it's worth your money.",Dawn of the Dead
200,billion_mucks,Zombie Extreme with a New Touch,8,5 November 2007,"Zombies. The genre of zombies when being A class is a delight on suspense. With this movie, set upon current times, delimiters a narrow, smart premise that makes you wonder what would you do in such situation of devastation and terror, where would you go, it immediately grips you and holds you praising for the survival of the ""not zombies"".The gruesome but excellent make-up sets a standard of classy directing and the story does focus on another sight: the survivors. I think its nice to see how the human stories develop in such a tremendous and scary context. However, this is not it. Do not be fooled. You will find zombies, tense situations, and funny situations as well. Its a great movie for the cult, a nasty good addition.",Dawn of the Dead
201,w00f,Happy Fun Zombie Movie (complete with HAPPY FUN SPOILERS),8,20 March 2004,"I held off seeing this movie until several hours after it opened.  That's an accomplishment for me, because I LOVE zombie movies.  Given a choice, I'd rather watch flesh-eating walking dead menace the populace than just about anything else.And this loose remake of the 1978 classic is, indeed, a typical zombie movie... which shouldn't be too surprising, since Romero's ""Living Dead"" films set the standard for zombie horror for two generations now.But this is not George Romero.  Zack Snyder does a good job retooling and directing this fine piece of gore cinema, but anyone expecting to see a Romero movie isn't going to be happy.  Snyder hasn't set out to duplicate the original; he grabs lots of of elements from it, but he twists them around to suit the purposes of an audience that's far more jaded than those who saw Romero's sequel.The zombies in Snyder's vision of the apocalypse as experience from the inside of a shopping mall aren't slow, lumbering creatures.  They move just as fast as the living, in fact... and they don't get tired.  They're quick and relentless, and there's no sense of the kind of vulnerability that was inherent in Romero's stiff, ready-to-fall-down anyhow undead.  These things can take you by surprise and hit you before you know what's happening.Unlike the 1978 film, wherein the characters were determined to hole up in the mall for as long as possible, the consensus among most of those in the new version is that they don't want to die in a place filled with muzak and timed lighting.  In fact, the only character who wants to stay put also turns out to be the most self-centered of the bunch, and perhaps that's Snyder's message in this film (if there is one); it's better to die than be a slave to the artificial consumer world.  In Romero's movie, the dead were drawn to the mall out of habituation; in Snyder's, it's the living that go there for no particularly good reason and soon realize that they can't stay. The dead only come when they figure out that there are living people already there.There are some excellent scenes and effects in this film.  Paramount is a scene of an exploding propane tank among a huge crowd of zombies.  The scene is shot from above and is at once both immaculately beautiful and horrible. We're also treated to the birth of an undead baby in this one, a bit of zombie possibility that has been utterly ignored by film makers outside of the much underrated ""Dead Alive"" (aka ""Braindead"").This is NOT the most gory zombie film ever - not by a long shot.  It may have been before it was cut to get an R rating, but there have definitely been more blood-soaked zombie flicks.  On the other hand, this movie does manage to be suspenseful at times, especially during the initial set-up. The make-up effects are excellent, and there are certainly scenes in this one where even a jaded flesh-muncher watcher will find his/herself sliding down on their seat and bracing for impact.  That's not to say it takes a lot of cheap shots; it doesn't engage in a lot of hand-on-the-shoulder kind of behavior.  Nor is there much subtlety here.  You know what the zombies want.This is not Academy Award material.  The acting is good but not great. Zombie fans will enjoy this; non-zombie fans (and I dare say most movie critics) will discard it out of hand.  No big surprise there.  ""Dawn of the Dead, the Remake"" delivers what it promises, and what it promises is a good time for people who think that the walking dead make for a good time.The soundtrack is... unusual.  There is, of course, the Muzak in the mall, and hearing the bland, banal tones of ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" and ""You Light Up My Life"" playing over the end of the world is a nice touch.  There's also a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek, lounge lizard version of ""Get Down With the Sickness"" that's bound to crack a few smiles in the audience.  As if to highlight the films post-punk, anti-consumer culture mentality, it closes with Jim Carroll's ""People Who Died,"" one of my personal 1980's punk anthems.A quick hint to fellow zombie lovers: DO NOT LEAVE THE THEATER WHEN THE CREDITS START ROLLING.  This movie has a false ending; you don't see the real ending unless you sit through the credits.  Plus, if you leave too soon, you'll miss lots of gratuitous close-up zombie shots!This is a Happy Fun Zombie Movie for Happy Fun Zombie People.  If you want to see things coming back from the dead but aren't the kind of person who wants to sit through ""The Passion of the Christ"" (to which this film makes a timely and happily-received counterpoint for some of us!), this is THE flick for you!",Dawn of the Dead
202,spacemonkey_fg,A great zombie flick that stands on its own,9,19 March 2004,"Title: Dawn of the Dead (2004)Director: Zack SnyderCast: Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, Jake Weber, Michael KellyTagline: When theres no more room in Hell the dead will walk the earth.Review:Going into this movie I was allready going in with the mindset of ""this is not really a remake"" so I wasnt really ready to compare every single scene or line of dialogue to Romeros zombie classic. I was just here to see yet another zombie flick thats came about thanks to the glorious revival of the zombie flick.The end of the world has come, chaos has started to spread and the dead are coming back to life! A group of people get together and in order to survive the chaos thats going on in the world, they decide that its a good idea to lock themselves up in a nearby mall.I was very impressed with this film, I was to tell you the truth expecting to be a little dissapointed. I wasnt expecting a really really good zombie film but thats what I got anyways! Yup, you heard me, this one was good!
Lets see where do I start? Oh yeah...a kick ass opening that goes for the jugular!  I was thinking to myself ""they better do a good opening sequence and blow my mind"" well, those first few minutes were great! The set the mood for the film. Hey! Its the end of the world! People running on the streets, cars crashing, choppers flying around, buildings burning...this was the beginnings of the fucking apocalypse and I devoured every last single second of it! Ok so we got a good opening...did the rest of the movie stay as good? Hell yeah!We get some interesting characters to hang out with here. Ving Rhymes was a bad mofo you didnt want to mess with and a lot of his lines where some of the ones that got the most reactions from the crowd. We also get what I like to call ""zombie food"" characters. They are day for one reason alone...to be eaten by the undead. Heh...therefore aside from a few outstanding characters youll get a few cardboard ones.What I liked the most about this here flick was that the characters you thought youd end up hating you actually ended up liking...and vice versa. You feel like you want the ""white trash"" dude to die...but then you kind of warm up to him. You think that the smart guy will end up being the weak guy...in fact ends up being a strong character. The movie was different in that way.It was also different in the sense that the zombies are wild and crazy...they are not Fulcis or Romeros slow movie zombies. These are more like the infected people we saw in 28 days later. Savage and with hatred in their eyes. Though slow moving zombies are the traditional way to go, I have to admit that I found these fast moving zombies to be more of a threat which helped make the movie more intense.It has some really original moments that really cought me off guard, like I said this movie just took me by surprise. Theres some stuff involving a pregnant mother which I thought was handled properly. It could have gone the wrong way...but thank got it was subtle yet effective.
Also the movie has some touching moments. Its not a film devoid of human emotions or feelings, its actually got some nice moments in there in which you see that the characters care for each other, they show their humanity amongst all the crazyness, I thought that was a nice touch.
Then we have the ending...ok Ill just say this. The last 20 minutes of this movie should not let any real horror movie/gore hound down. The last scenes where amazing in terms of delivering the goods gore wise! Dont get me wrong, the rest of the movie is great it has gore...but they saved the best for last. This movie is not a PG-13 ""safe"" type of horror movie. Oh no, this ones not afraid to go for what we zombie loving horror fans want....gore and lots of it. So Gorehounds should be pleased, theres just enough gore to keep us happy. Two words...chain saw.In conclusion, Id say this was an unexpected treat. I was expecting a semi good, slightly dissapointing rehash of Romeros flick...but what I got was a solid zombie flick. Its solid I tell ya! Its got everything youd expect from a good zombie movie and a few unexpected surprises. This ones going to be a good addition to my zombie movie collection!Rating: 41/2 out of 5",Dawn of the Dead
203,jmorrison-2,Decent Movie,7,27 December 2005,"I can't say I'm a big horror movie fan, but this was a decent, fun movie to watch. The movie was put together well, and begins horrifyingly. The sweeping shots of the unbelievable chaos going on as Sarah Polley escapes her neighborhood are well done.I was really taken with the opening montage, portrayed with a Johnny Cash song, which I'm guessing is called ""When the man comes around"". Very good movie opening; well done, and provides a visual and musical taste of the ugliness to come.The movie provides a little black humor in the middle, as the occupants of the mall indulge in silly fantasies to temporarily escape the terrifying situation they are in (Sex, rooftop golf, dress-up, etc.), all done to a tune that seems to be called ""Get down with the sickness"". There is also a segment of ""Zombie-Celebrity-look-a-like"" shooting gallery that is humorous.Ving Rhames, Jake Weber and Mekhi Phifer are excellent actors who lend name recognition, and strong screen presence to this remake. The other actors all do a fine job rounding out the characters trapped in the mall.Not overly gory, but an enjoyable, and well done, horror movie.Stick around for the end credits, for a montage hinting at the fate of our heroes.",Dawn of the Dead
204,JPfanatic93,It took the rise of the dead for a remake to be better than its predecessor,8,23 September 2013,"Few remakes ever surpass their predecessors, but this one gets remarkably close, if it's not a definite improvement over the already great original George A. Romero zombie classic from 1978. Zack Snyder, who would go on to direct 300, Watchmen and unfortunately Sucker Punch, first proved his talent for adapting – in this case re-adapting – other people's work with this gripping, gory and hugely entertaining horror flick. A zombie plague engulfs America after which a band of survivors barricades itself in a shopping mall for safety. Tensions run high in the group as its members continue to find themselves attacked by the living dead and eventually a choice must be made: do these people decide to stay in their safe haven where they got everything they need except their freedom, or do they take their chances storming out in an attempt to find out whether there's other people still alive out there in some remote and secure location, with the hopes of joining them.The story remains largely the same (except for the absence of a violent, marauding biker gang invading the mall), but the hungry undead are more lethal than ever, this time also adding speed to help satiate their lust for devouring human flesh, making them much easier to take seriously than Romero's slow, lumbering walking dead, thus only enhancing the suspense (and the body count). Fantastic make-up effects galore in this picture, providing a wide array of eerie zombies and disturbing scenes of dismemberment and bloodshed. Still, Snyder doesn't let the gore rule the film, but prefers to locate the horror in the story itself. Of particularly great shock effect is the film's fabulous opening, which starts off very restrained and seemingly normal with a nurse just going home after a hard day's work, going to bed at night and waking up the next morning finding her neighbourhood burning in utter chaos and despair as it has suddenly fallen prey to a zombie apocalypse. Though the movie treats us to many a memorable moment of naked, merciless terror later on, this gruesome opening stands out as its most horrifying scene. The TV show The Walking Dead – though itself based on a graphic novel – would later feature a very similar world of undead post-apocalyptics, clearly inspired by this remake and building on its premise of a ragtag group of survivors trapped in a hellish world ruled by hungry corpses.",Dawn of the Dead
205,scobbah,A good tribute,7,4 July 2004,"The original Dawn of the Dead felt too bad to make a remake of at first, but when I heard that it was only going to be a tribute with a little more budget than the original - I just couldn't believe my ears and after seeing the trailer I just had to see this piece at the cinema. Once off to pay a visit at the cinema due the rain, we we're settled down in the seats of the cinema to watch the tribute to Dawn of the Dead. I got very surprised by the movie itself, since it were not a real ""splatter"", but it were not like a total rip-off from 28 days later neither. It was a good mix up with some flesh exposure together with heavy combats, and it had all those spices I like in a zombie piece like this. The best is that they add a little bit of comedy to it, who makes it even more deep and playful along the road - not only rabbit hunt with the shotguns. 7/10",Dawn of the Dead

I find this enjoyable and creepy, a few spoilers, for example, the beginning with the girl coming to the main characters room shocked me, and the way the world is falling apart also gave the creeps, and not to mention, the unforgettable cameo of the original Dawn of the Dead star once again says his famous line from the original,""when there is no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the Earth"", and the part with Mekhi going berserk and his child tuns into a zombie, I swear it gave a few bad dreams! But just a few major problems, zombies don't run, but why did they make them run? That wasn't scary at all, it seemed like a laughable Tales From The Crypt episode to me, in which the crypt keeper would call a ""hack and field"" race. BLEH! Or the scenes with the gun shop owner on the roof, and the ending was a lame Blair Witch rip-off. That's not the worst part. Where are the bikers? The original was said to have a gang, where are they? I didn't see any of them. Despite all these flaws, I recommend this to people who are hard core fans of the Dead trilogy, which I believe will no longer be a trilogy, for Romero seems to be making another Dead movie. Oh these days, remake happy days. Lost In Space, The Mummy, Charlie's Angels, Starsky And Hutch, Psycho, The Grudge, what's next?",Dawn of the Dead

This woman's boyfriend gets bitten by this infected..........thing and thus dies and becomes one of the living dead. We then see a truck full of stow aways and a few other scenes with died people that are now zombies kill people.Although this is a good movie I wouldn't recommend it. Too much blood and too much sexual content.,Dawn of the Dead
208,elcopy,"So good, it's scary",9,1 April 2004,"I saw the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" many years ago.

And boy, this movie is good.The original ""Dawn of the Dead"" was smarter, but this one succeeds gloriously in other ways the original didn't.Spoilers: The first scene of the chaos is incredible, the scene of the pregnant woman giving birth is a zillion times scarier than the original, and the diseased fat lady who looks like was taken out from a scene from the movie ""Seven"" is the scariest thing I've seen in a movie in years. The chainsaw scene -a horror movie staple- is done here flawlessly.Add the tons of gore, a cool soundtrack and a great idea to begin with, and you have one of the coolest, scariest movies ever.

A moviegoer in the row behind me was trembling so hard he shook both rows of seats, eliciting comments from a number of others in the theater.Many have compared the opening sequences of the two movies, Dawn1's opening with a chaotic news show is the more disturbing of the two, Dawn2's opening is consistent with modern horror and is above average for the genre. Both movies remain consistent to the themes established in the opening sequences, Dawn1 is slower, has more substance and shock value; Dawn2 is fast paced and goes for the throat. The pace of Dawn2 continues to quicken until the end when it becomes a struggle to comprehend the staccoto of images hammering at your brain. I am still not sure how several events exactly happened, particularly the 'rescue' and the 'escape', only that they did happen.Several things were distracting in Dawn2, even annoying: The primal cat screams of the zombies for one. I found myself wincing just from the volume of the screaches and my dread of the zombies was more rooted in the sounds they made than their viciousness, which was also distracting. There is no doubt that in real life, the zombies of Dawn2 would be scarier and deadlier. Romero's zombies were a force of nature, chaotic and opportunistic; you could survive if you were quick enough and smart enough. Snyder's zombies are so vicious and fast, it is difficult to imagine surviving on wits and certainly not on speed, maybe with a tank. The one burr that really bucked my horse was the infection angle which seems directly lifted from 28 Days Later. All dead people came to life in the original (except maybe those with brain damage?), but in the remake zombification is spread via bites like rabies. If the zombies are infected with some disease, it makes the tagline, 'When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.' seem superfluous.It is easy to nitpick, few movies survive close scrutiny. Overall the people in Dawn2 act within the normal range of human behavior, sometimes smart, sometimes stupid. There is the requisite moment when your mind is screaming 'DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR!', but if you've driven on a freeway you understand that people are sometimes inexplicably dumb. Darwin Rules!I would give it a 7/10 overall, 9/10 for the genre. The remake is a visceral experience. I highly recommend you go experience it.",Dawn of the Dead
210,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Less enjoyable than the original,6,28 August 2013,"Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the original DOTD which I saw for the first time yesterday, giving me a really solid base to review this title on.The pace is a lot faster in this film, zombies included, as well as having obvious updates in action, gore and realistic effects. They still got the colour of blood wrong at the beginning though.One of the problems with the first movie is the incompetent nature of the zombies which only really pose a threat because of their sheer number, whereas in this film they're a real individual THREAT, behaving like incensed, rabid animals. This however removes the comedy element of the first film, but does make this a more accurate horror survival film instead of a tongue-in-cheek horror comedy.The genius of the original film is captured to an extent and then, unfortunately, tossed away. Imagine being stuck in a shopping mall (albeit surrounded by zombies) and discovering you have free access to everything under the sun, day after day, for as long as you want it. After the shock of being surrounded by rabid zombies wears off, the cast start to live it up, enjoying the fruits and fun of all the trappings of life, right? No, they don't! And that's the main problem with this version of DOTD. Although much more realistic and frightening, they eventually decide to make a crazy run for it, away from the shopping mall. Why, instead of using common sense and choosing to stay in a secure environment with everything necessary to survive, including food, drink and welding equipment!, would they suddenly decide to head for the marina in a couple of Mad Max style souped up buses? It made no sense during the film, nor after it ended.All sorts of other questions popped into my mind such as the part with the girl stealing a van and driving, unopposed by zombie masses to rescue the dog. It's a nice, sentimental touch, but when they make their escape at the end they can't drive out of the parking lot because of the dense mass of zombies blocking the route.For all it's flaws, I did enjoy this film, but I just wasn't as entertained as in the first film, which I initially thought was going to be a load of sh*t, but turned out to be really, really good fun.The cameo appearance by one of the lead actors in the original film, as a TV evangelist, was a nice little touch in this decent, pretty entertaining action-horror film, which is a lot better than a LOT of other horror flicks released over the last decade, but which misses out on the humour element which the original film grasped, realized was very important, and thrived on until the end credits.",Dawn of the Dead
211,mrush,Most excellent remake of a classic,8,3 May 2006,"This is one fun movie.I hate most remakes of classics,however this is a super well done remake.This is Zack Synder's remake of the George A.Romero classic zombie flick.A group of people are thrown together in their quest to evade the hordes of flesh craving zombies that have taken over the city.They hole up in a mall.The zombies in this film are fast and mean,like zombies on steroids.And there are thousands of them roaming the streets outside the mall.The mall group starts communicating with a gun shop owner trapped in his shop across the street.The gun shop owner and his desperate attempt to survive the zombie attacks all alone are very poignant and that is one of the things that make this film unique.The DVD package has a special feature where,Andy,the gun shop owner, videotapes his desperate struggle.This film has all the gore and blood that you could want.You ever seen a zombie woman give birth to a zombie baby? Well you will in this film.Thousands of fast moving zombies run wild in the streets in this movie perhaps fulfilling the vision that Romero had seen but wasn't able to finance back in 1978 when he made the original.This film may usher in a new breed of fast animal-like zombie that may change the zombie genre forever.But if not it will still be a cool gory zombie flick with a cast of thousands of panther quick zombies.",Dawn of the Dead
212,InaneSwine,"Scary, gory and fun",7,3 December 2017,"It contains little character development, and ignores the social commentary provided by the original and instead focuses on creating an action flick. Nonetheless, in this respect, it works. It's scary, gory and fun; and its opening sequence is one of the best and most tense opening sequences of all time.",Dawn of the Dead
213,thegreenarrow-28184,Too Long,6,19 September 2019,"It was a good movie, fun and with good kills, but it was too long, at times i felt it was dragging, not even sure why. i have yet to see the orginal orginal, but from what i know, this was pretty close to that movie",Dawn of the Dead
214,mungflesh,Old vs New,7,1 April 2004,"Before I say anything about the movie I'd like to add my 2cents on the old vs new argument.Hold the thought that ""the old one was pants because ..."". Just bear in mind that in 20 years time people might be saying the same thing about the current one. Does that affect what you think of the movie when you see it now?The original Dawn of the Dead does look lame in many ways in comparison to the remake, but how could it not on a $1.5million budget compared to however many multiples of that budget the new one cost? If a movie could be weighed on the ratio of box office takings to budget, the remake would probably have to scrape $1bn to match the original's performance.Now here's what I think of the 2004 one.[potential SPOILERS follow]A great opening and introduction to the characters. Sfx/gore pretty impressive so far but nothing to really make me cringe. The threat of the zombies is well realised and the sense of claustrophobia as with the Romero originals is achieved very quickly.Now comes the middle section full of tension and ""how are they going to get out of here"" questions arising. A few more faces get introduced. Fat woman - pretty gross.Pointless bit in basement where somebody dies and then they get back upstairs. Sorry, so they've gained a dog - not pointless. Definitely better however and more concise than the really drawn out bit in DOTD 78 where David Emge plays basement zombie hide and seek for 10mins.Zombie baby - sod off you're crap. Second most pointless thing after zombie vs shark scene in Lucio Fulci's imaginatively titled ""Zombie"". Oh hang on I forgot the zombie family in The Video Dead (the worst film of all time). Anyway, hate the baby - what's up next?Here comes the biggest drawback of the movie so far. The disease is only spread if you're bitten. This is VERY 28 days later and really should have followed the Romero theme where the *dead* are coming back to life and not just the bitten who then died. For me, that's what was really scary in the first place because there really was no way of stopping it. People die every few seconds.Now the tough blonde lady brags to shoot man after he's dead. (Sarcasm)Well I don't know, whatever could be coming later then? A suggestion: in order to achieve the unpredictability of the Romero movies you'd have to start by reversing that one and have the guy shoot the woman after *she* were dead or something. Surely it's more likely to scare people if they *don't* know what's coming?Now if like me you're from the Romero school of thought and you've been used to the baddies getting their just-desserts at the hands of the hungry zombies you were probably waiting for that super-gory climax ... which never happens. Yeah they chainsaw some zombies and a poor girl gets sawed in the shoulder (the highlight of the fx for me) but no drawn out ripping to pieces of those that deserve it; no guts & organ munching for the undead. Real light snackers these Snyder zombies, always up for a quick bite but nothing more. Surprising seeing as they have so much energy.The ending? It's more of a stop than an end. Not poor though.Overall, I've been pretty nitpicky with the above comments but then this film *did* have the budget where DOTD 78 did not so I'm backing the underdog.If you've not yet seen either then I would recommend seeing the remake first as it is definitely more current and it'd be unlikely that you would not enjoy it. Although I've not stated them, this film *does* have many good scenes and ideas and will go down as a respectable remake. However, if you're a true zombie movie fan and have seen a few low-budget movies in your time then it's gotta be the original seen first and the remake after.Recommended 7.5/10",Dawn of the Dead
215,butchfilms,just a satisfactory terror action movie,6,12 October 2008,"this is a terror action movie that is just satisfactory, we have watched many movies like this before and i can say that it doesn't give us new things. the beginning of the movie offers a biggest expectation of what it finally delivers. i am not saying that this is a bad movie, but i would recommend to the general public watching this movie just if this is on TV unless u are a really fan of this kind of terror action films.the movie is about a group of people who try to survive in a mall the attacks of an epidemic that makes alive to dead people, and this living dead beings try to bite the normal people to turn them in one of themselves.",Dawn of the Dead

217,Derek237,Apocalyptic,8,25 April 2004,"More than any 'zombie' movie I've ever seen, this remake of Dawn Of The Dead feels most as if the world was actually ending. There's no surprise that Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" plays during the credits as we see news footage of the chaos occurring all over the world. Most of the movie takes place in a mall, so basically we're left in the dark as to what's going on everywhere else. The TV broadcasts have shut down, rescue helicopters have stopped coming, there's some guy on the roof of a building across the street. You start to wonder if these characters are the last surviving people on earth. Unlike the original Dawn Of The Dead, we aren't shown any other groups of people. And of course I have to bring this up: the running zombies. I actually thought it's scarier when they're running and screaming. Especially when they're in huge numbers like in one of the last sequences where the characters are trying to escape. But that's just my opinion. I guess overall more people prefer the slower, more reserved zombies. So to add it all up, there isn't anything really new or unique about this movie except maybe that the aspect of the apocalypse is accentuated more than it usually is in these kinds of movies. You have the long quiet scenes followed by a loud scare, the gruesome deaths, the comic relief thrown in here and there (really great comic relief by the way), all the ingredients to make a zombie movie. I probably would have liked it better if the ending wasn't so stupid but for the most part its really enjoyable and mildly scary. If you like zombie movies I don't see any reason why you wouldn't like this. It's a powerful horror/action flick. My rating: 8.5/10",Dawn of the Dead
218,Adorable,Bringing Down the Mall,8,13 July 2004,"Many argue George Romero's acclaimed Dawn of the Dead from 1978 remains one of the most poignant critiques of modern mercantile society, with its zombies analogous to raving shoppers clamoring to get their hands on what's inside the mall. As a celebrated release, DOTD78 may have little use for a remake, but sadly for it, the 2004 Zack Snyder refit brings to the screen enough class to qualify not only as the best zombie flick in a while, but to put Romero's original in the history books once and for all. There's a new undead king of the block in town, and it doesn't really even call itself a zombie movie. That's right, throughout the film's entire runtime not once is the Z word uttered, although characters do insinuate that ""we all know what they are"". What are they? In a bid to out-Capcom Resident Evil, DOTD04 postulates a ravaging, global plague of the ghoul-making variety rapidly decimating humanity all over the place. In a brazenly magnificent opening sequence, the story's background becomes vividly apparent and gripping. Hope has faded into nothingness. Suburbia is done for. A loosely-knit federation of survivors fortifies a local mall populated by made-up stores and semi-hostile security guards, not to mention several hungry flesh-munchers plus a horde of pissed-off super-undead at the double glass doors. Seemingly incompatible folk such as down-to-earth nurse Ana (Sarah Polly), sturdy cop Kenneth (Ving Rhames), sociopathic playboy Steve (Ty Burrell) and natural-leader Michael (Jake Weber) find themselves alone under the brunt of a surging, decaying tidal wave staffed by over-zealous Toronto-area extras. Mekhi Phifer delivers a young soon-to-be father overly protective of his young wife and unborn child, even though from the get go audiences realize this happens to be one pregnancy heading for disaster. Even Matt Frewer (Max Headroom!) stops by for a convincingly-eerie cameo. Together, the ragtag band must deal with issues like simple survival, handling infection victims with their transformation into zombies, taking in others as they arrive from the nightmarish outside, and plotting an escape route. These elements result in spurts of well-placed bloody gunfights that give an excellently urgent impression of just how unstoppable the walking corpses are. Very little suspense creeps into proceedings, partly because it stands as irrelevant. Savvy viewers with any knowledge of zombie lore should be able to fathom the story start to finish easily, meaning there's hardly any point using red herrings and plot twists in such a foregone conclusion.What earmarks DOTD04 as a capable picture has more to do with its relentless pace, authentic atmosphere and efficient characters, who all execute respective roles with great acumen. Snyder and Co also do admirable balancing work, keeping things sane despite copious amounts of blood, gore, dismemberments and shots to the head. Dawn of the Dead pays homage to startlingly violent, not gross. It also encompasses almost everything an R rated product should have, .i.e swearing, smoking and sex, all in modest dosages, but nonetheless in attendance. Speaking of R ratings, Snyder has made a name for himself as a director fiercely loyal to the more mature segments of the movie going crowd, having declined projects like S.W.A.T for being PG-13. Good for him. In comparing Romero's own '78 release and this one, a few facts become immediately clear. Unlike his zombies, Snyder's run fast and claw with irritating vivacity, while their older siblings shambled around apathetically (as did all zombies in the past). Character names have changed, but the story goes more or less the same, helped along by tastefully utilized CGI ingredients and a more upbeat McGuyver-esque scene where our valiant live-ons construct means of courageous degress. Overall, the new edition will likely appeal to more people, as opposed to its cultish ancestor. All this even in the face of a relatively paltry budget (28 mill). Oh, modern times. To its detriment, DOTD04 and its official website fail to acknowledge recent counterparts like Resident Evil and House of the Dead, both accomplished entries to the genre, despite including a zombie timeline (which mysteriously stops around 1999...). Furthermore, although thrilling and smooth, the movie lacks any memorable one-liners, which always help augment movies so nicely. For something a bit braver than your typical weekend foray, and definitely more colorful than most of its contemporaries combined, check out Dawn of the Dead and keep telling yourself its popcorn the guy in the back row's eating. Sure, popcorn.Rating: * * * 1/2",Dawn of the Dead
219,sujith789_reviews,Good Horror Movie - (8.0),8,24 August 2020,Good horror movie. Keep us engaged from start to end. A movie where we have to hold our breathe and watch.There are many frightening scenes.Would highly recommend if you like horror/zombie movies.,Dawn of the Dead
220,Mulliga,"A very good, but not classic, remake of the original (spoilers)",8,26 March 2004,"Some horror movie remakes are as good or even better than the source material - the '78 version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" John Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" and Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" spring to mind.The ""Dawn"" remake, though a very good movie that all involved should be proud of, doesn't quite pull it off. It's quite entertaining and even has the trademark bleak, ambiguous ending of the series, but it just doesn't have the teeth or the soul of the original.I don't know what to say about the remake. It certainly wasn't scarier than the original - zombie movies are hardly ever scary anyway. It was more ""intense,"" if intensity can be measured by the volume of the sound effects in the movie and the speed of the zombies. The visual effects, set design, and score were all pretty much spot-on and, dare I say, better than the original.Why didn't I walk away with the same ""Whoa!"" feeling I had when I first watched ""Dawn"" '78 on VHS?Is the acting and characterization better than '78? Rhames and Polley are very good, and some of the other characters really stand out - C.J., Michael, and Andy. Everyone else seems to be window dressing, unfortunately. The original had four wonderfully drawn, complex characters - this one still has about four strong characters, but it also includes half a dozen people to be zombie chow. Too many people are introduced too fast for my taste - some of them literally only have one or two lines before getting munched by one of the new uber-zombies.Ah, yes, the fast zombies. These guys can sprint as fast as when they were alive, they can punch through car windows and doors, and they can jump like spiders. They can crawl through dog doors like a snake, and they scale fences and climb buses arguably faster than living humans could. They are definitely more like ""Return"" or 28DL zombies, but with arguably less intelligence. They work pretty well IMHO, but the zombies aren't the problem.The problem is the mall. Or, more specifically, the non-use of the mall. The original Dawn had that one half hour section in it (if you're a fan, you know the part) that will live on forever - the section where they live, hunkered down in the mall, for months, enjoying all its spoils, and realize that it's all meaningless, and that material things can't provide happiness. I LOVED this part - more than the gut-muching, more than the headshots, more than the rock-em-sock-em action - because it actually made me sad. I mean, how many horror movies make you sad and feel the bleakness that the characters feel? The original Dawn did this. The new one basically has people all bunched up in a coffee shop.The social commentary is gone, as expected, and it has been replaced by dozens of gunshots. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I find myself wishing for classic lines like ""When there's no more room in Hell..."" There are quite a few homages and cameos for fans (I definitely cracked a smile when I saw ""Gaylen Ross"" as a store name).All in all, a worthy remake that is better than I thought it would be, but I still wish Romero was involved.3 out of 4 stars",Dawn of the Dead
221,MairegChernet,This is how remakes should be made.,8,9 June 2008,I have not seen the original Dawn of The Dead. However seeing this awesome remake I want to see the original and compare the two. Zack Snyder makes this unforgettable remake by taking George A. Romeo's screenplay and adding the new millennium's CGI effects. 90 percent of the film is filled with zombie action and blood splattering all over. The other 10 percent focuses on the main characters' back ground info and characters turning on one another.Although I shouldn't say this this without watching the first This is perhaps the best remake of all time. A new era for Zack Snyder. Overall A very Good slasher movie.,Dawn of the Dead
222,TheGreatMarkukini,A zombie movie with a soul and quite a bit of brains,8,19 February 2020,"Today I learned that Zack Snyder reshot the original in cooperation with its director George A. Romero, after finishing the 2004 version I caught myself on the thought that want to check out the late-seventies predecessor. But for now I need to take my hat off in honor of great writing and captivating work of the director in this particular case.In the beginning I had the worst feeling that you can get while anticipating a horror movie - the fear that there will be no atmosphere whatsoever. I thought that I am watching a comedy with scary spooks as the music was overtense like in parody, and the colors were too bright. But when the story actually kicked in, it got to me. It is serious. I am in the middle of a zombie apocalypse!The sole island of our survivors in the huge mall is presumably the only place around with living people in the sea of the dead. Probably this plays the major factor in bonding the characters together and also forms a strong connection with the viewer. The other factor is that they human nature is presented at its best: everyone has fears, trust issues or simple needs to do something just not to get bored. The development of each hero is beautifully done and no one is useless. Everyone counts in this game of survival.The decisions taken by the team are surprisingly reasonable, with a few remarks, of course (no, in some cases I cannot blame stress). The finishing part is a raging mix of adrenaline, stress and unbelievable bond of strangers that have become the closest people on the face of Earth.I cannot say that you will be scared to death while watching the movie, but this is the beauty: no cheap jump scares and constant feeling of danger behind every corner. Don't forget to watch the end credits to get even more horror in your system (or maybe it is only in the director's cut? If so - check out the director's cut!).",Dawn of the Dead
223,Alcaminhante,The best action/adventure movie since Aliens.,10,27 September 2004,"I don't have much of positive to say about this movie that hasn't been said here before by other persons, but i truly loved this movie. Unfortunely i haven't seen in in the theaters, but i just saw the new DVD with th directors cut, and i was truly surprised by what he achieved with this pic. It was more like an un-official sequel to 28 Days Later but that was one of the reasons i really enjoyed this movie now. It gave me more of what i wanted to see in 28 Days Later, and it was perfectly successful in creating an atmosphere of pure end of the world in a bigger scale. And it was as much scary as it was thrilling to watch. Very good characters we cared about and excellent action scenes which didn't compromised the atmosphere just to flash off some effects. A very well balanced film with also a fantastic beginning.I loved all the old versions of Romero and much of all the zombie stuff, but this remake now kept me on the edge of my sofa the entire time. I bought the DVD two days ago, (along with Star Wars), and Star Wars is still inside the box, while i've seen Dawn of the Dead twice now. By the way great audio commentary also on the DVD.This movie brought me back the thrills i had when i first saw Aliens. The character of JC even reminded me of Hicks in some way and so in an age where most of the blockbusters who come out of Hollywood are nothing but a bunch of boring junk-food for the eyes, it was great to find an action movie who totally delivered what it promised. Scary and exciting. One of the best adventure movies in a veeeery long time also. 10, out of 10Please make another !",Dawn of the Dead

Here's what makes it great:-Similar enough to the original to be a worthy remake -Different enough to stand on it's own -Excellent zombie effects (and the sheer numbers--GOD!!) -Incredible gore, especially for an R-rated film, released in a theater -Johnny Cash....? -Cameos of original actors...? -Tom Savini cameo!!And the fact that this movie had the BALLS to churn out real violence, action, gore, and scares holds it above all this other later crap--crap like that butchered Alien Vs Predator movie.

225,scott-sw,Pretty good remake.,8,7 February 2008,"Usually, I do not like remakes. However, the contemporary version of Dawn of the Dead breaks the usual trend and entertained me. It could never live up to the original caliber and vision of the original 1978 masterpiece, but it makes a good movie in its own rite. A nurse named Ana (Sarah Polley) wakes up one morning to find her world upside down. Her husband is immediately infected by a virus that brings back the dead. She runs to find Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Steve (Ty Burrell) along with a few other survivors. Afraid of the zombies, they decide to hide in a large mall. Unfortunately, they meet the wrong mall security guards. CJ (Michael Kelly) leads his deputies to threaten, intimidate, and harass their fellow humans whom they consider captives. Eventually, Ana, Steve and Kenneth are able to take over and allow more people to seek refuge in the mall. They make a friend across the street. Andy (Bruce Bohne) might as well be miles away as thousands of zombies litter the street in full force. They communicate with signs. Eventually, they realize they cannot stay or they will die. They make an attempt to escape to an island within the Great Lakes. To review this one, you have to compare it to the original. In the first place, I will fault the new adaptation with having too many characters. At one point, it gets weighed down. Still, the dynamic is more ripe for conflict amidst the survivors. At the same time, some characters are redeemed, like CJ who eventually comes around to be an all right guy. Also, the idea of fast moving zombies really adds to the tension. It made me wonder if they represented the disenfranchised and angry consumer as opposed to the mindless shopper zombie of the original movie. Also, while the original had a few scares, this one is more action oriented. It moves much faster to entertain instead of developing slowly to create thought. I also liked the cameos by Scott Reiniger, David Emgee and Ken Foree. I will also say this version has a more cynical and dark ending as opposed to the original. This is neither good or bad, just different. Still, I thought the movie deserved a better ending. Dawn of the Dead 2004 has enough to make it fresh, and enough to keep you interested. Just don't expect it to overshadow Romero's masterpiece.",Dawn of the Dead
226,ghoulieguru,The Coming Dawn,8,19 November 2004,"I went into this thinking it was gonna suck. I love the original Dawn of the Dead, and I thought that having James Gunn (of Scooby Doo fame) writing it was going to ensure its place in the bad remakes of history... Right next to the Psycho remake. I mean, when you have a great piece of material, why remake it? Only remake movies that stunk in the first place. Don't remake the classics. That was my attitude. But this movie surprised me. The filmmakers successfully took George Romero's dystopic view of modern society and reinvented it for a new generation. My main question is, did this really need to be a remake? I mean, clearly it shared some things conceptually with Romero's (like the mall, and some of the moments) but this also felt like a pretty complete reboot. I wonder if they could have created this movie as a stand alone zombie flick? Perhaps there is value in the title ""Dawn of the Dead"". Who knows what drives those studio execs? In the end, this was a successful, fun zombie movie. The characters were a little flat and some of the action was predictable, but the overall effect was good enough for me to give this movie 7 out of 10 stars. Teamed with ""28 Days Later"", I think these two films have brought about a nice zombie rebirth. Unfortunately, that also gives you the B versions like ""Corpses are Forever"" and ""Bloody Bill"", but I still think a resurgence of the zombie genre is a good thing.",Dawn of the Dead
227,RJBrez,"Under appreciated, like most of Snyder's work",8,2 December 2020,"I gave Dawn of the Dead a rewatch recently for a few reasons.1) 2020 blows and I can't handle anymore bad news or negativity so I watch a bunch of movies to avoid the news.2) it's been years since I watched it
3) I'll say it proudly, I'm a Snyder fan. I think he's a brilliant director.
So I decided to buy this movie because it was cheap on Black Friday. A few things really stood out to me during the rewatch. It starts out with a bang to hook you in, and then gives you some unexpected character development in a unique setting. The cast doesn't really have a ""star"" but it's a solid and diverse crew. It was also really weird to see Phil Dunphy (TY Burrell) from Modern Family playing a cocky jerk, but he played it well. On top of all that, the zombies in this movie are awesome.I also found it cool that James Gunn wrote the screenplay.Also, good news for zombie fans, Snyder has another zombie flick coming out in 2021 on Netflix, called Army Of The Dead. Most people believe this is not a sequel to Dawn of the Dead and probably just a stand alone story. Dave Bautista and Omari Hardwick will star in it.Thanks for reading.",Dawn of the Dead
228,boondocksaint20,Top notch action/horror entertainment,9,16 April 2004,"I am a huge horror movie buff, but the movies that I consider 'quality' horror films, either high rate horror or blissfully B-budget masterpieces are few and far between.  When I heard that they were remaking Romero's Dawn, the first thought in my mind was that this one was going to suck...hard.  Then I saw the 10 minute preview on tv prior to the movie's release, and I was very impressed.  It was at that point I said what the hay, and I decided to do what I usually do when a new horror film comes out...cough up the 6 bucks and blindly give it a chance, expecting the wor st but hoping for the best.I was totally blown away by this remake.  The acting, direction and dialogue are all very compelling and well done.  I know, I'm surprised I'm actually saying this about a horror film, but it's true (even a good number of the self righteous critics out there praised this one, which is a feat within itself for any horror film).  The cast do an incredible job with fleshing out their characters, and making us give a damn about most of them.  Sure, you have you 'zombie fodder' stock characters including the cynical smartass metrosexual, the blonde slut, the clueless and scared girl, the gun totin' redneck, and others, but they all play their characters' one of two traits very well and convincingly (even Matt Frewer...that's right, Max Headroom, has a small part in this as the ill-fated father of one of the survivors). In addition to this, we also have an interesting combination of main characters, all of whom are played well, and play their stereotypes well, but each give a hint of confliction that makes them all interesting.
***Possible Spoilers*** For example, one character, played by Michael Kelly portrays the token remorseless self serving jerk, a character who most of the audience loathes and knows will get his comeuppance, but then completes a 180 halfway through and becomes one of the heroes.  This character to me, was the most compelling, and the unexpected transformation was a welcome change from the usual bad guy in a panic situation (i.e. Cooper from Night of the Living Dead).  Others are Jake Weber's Michael, a guy who wants to do right and lives through practicality, yet find confliction when faced with killing someone who is infected, along with Sarah Polley, whose character also wants to do the right thing, but thinks with her emotions more than what is happening in reality.  And of course Ving Rhames, whose tough guy character opens a soft spot for a stranded survivor ontop a roof across the street whose only means of communication is holding up a dry erase board and writing messages back and forth.  Speaking of this character, Andy, gun shop owner stranded on his roof, this was an excellent addition to the story and made for a compelling subplot.**End of Spoilers***Though for all it's greatness, there are still moments of pure stupidity where you literally want to scream at the characters for their lack of common sense (scenes where no sane person would ever do, no matter how rattled by stress or fear) but for a horror movie, these scenes are surprisingly few and far between.  This isn't the social commentary that Romero made, this is a film on it's own that only borrows the zombies (who now run at supersonic speed) and the shopping mall from him.  This is an entirely new film and it succeeds at being what it wants to be...a slick action film with thrilling suspense.  I think in a lot of respects, this movie beats the original in terms of characterization.
A lot of ppl praise the original and say this movie is nowhere near it...I used to love the original, but after watching it again recently am a little shocked I ever loved such a movie with horrible acting, no character development, crappy effects makeup and the most horrendous musical score I have ever heard in a movie.  Granted I still enjoy the original, but my point is that the new dawn exceeds in many areas where the original failed.At any rate, this is the best horror film I have seen in years...it is exciting, humorous, and a very bloody good time at the movies.  It is not going to win oscars, but it is going to win over many more ppl when it comes out on dvd.  This is a horror film buff's wetdream...an actioner that provides the scares, suspense and dark humor.  9/10 stars.",Dawn of the Dead
229,qball_82,A satisfying horror movie.,8,10 June 2004,"Wow, what a ride! I'm not familiar with the original film so I cannot make comparisons, but this is a great flick. I watched the horrid ""Soul Survivors"" with Eliza Dushku last night and I was desperate for a horror movie done right. Dawn of the Dead is one such horror flick!The opening sequence gets the blood pumping before the opening credits even roll, and while Dawn of the Dead isn't a non-stop rollercoaster of blood 'n guts, it is paced nicely and will keep you entertained from start to finish. Speaking of blood 'n guts, Dawn of the Dead has some slightly graphic scenes but really this is pretty tame. There is an atmosphere of menace and dread and the moment you put yourself in the character's shoes, you have chills running up and down your spine.The acting is pretty standard fare, bordering on quite good. For casual movie fans and horror junkies alike, Dawn of the Dead is an enjoyable watch.",Dawn of the Dead
230,filmbuff-36,"""Attention Shoppers! The mall is now closing forever..""",8,29 March 2004,"How will mankind behave in the end times? Will we turn into raving lunatics and attack one another? Will we try to slavishly hold onto some fabric of our society? Will we kick back and accept what is happening?`Dawn of the Dead' in some ways tries to answer that question. The movie, a remake of George Romero's classic 1978 sequel to `Night of the Living Dead,' throws a group of people together while society crumbles around them and allows the viewer to watch as humans seek to survive an onslaught of the undead.The movie opens with the unimaginable happening. Hordes of zombies have overtaken Milwaukee and numerous survivors are both fighting off the monsters and trying to escape the city. One such group includes Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who is running scared after losing her husband, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a tough-as-nails cop, Michael (Jake Weber), who tries to be two-steps ahead of any dangerous situation, and Andre (Mekhi Phifer), whose trying to care of his pregnant wife.Seeking shelter from the waves of zombie attacks, the group decides to head toward a local mall and hole up there until help arrives. Once inside they join with security guards and use the shopping center as a refuge from the undead while trying to piece together what's left of their lives.The plot is pretty straightforward, and relies mostly on cliché themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.As Ana, Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic.Rhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge.First time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively, keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavy-handed sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most big-budget horror movies -- Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves.The horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention, which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap.All to often most horror movies are just excuses for numerous poorly developed characters to be killed in awful ways for the enjoyment of the audience. As far as recent zombie movies go, `Dawn of the Dead' thankfully remains closer to `28 Days Later' than `House of the Dead.'However, despite all the movie's strengths, it still pales in comparison to the original. Romero's `Dawn of the Dead' took the premise of people trapped in mall and used it to make some pointed social commentary about consumerism. The first '`Dawn' had human characters selfishly hoarding material goods for themselves, using the mall not only as a refuge from zombies but also as their own personal palace that provides them with more items than they could ever need.It's to the detriment of the new film that it never takes the concept to this level. Here, the story seems to take place in a mall because it's a cool place for a horror movie, not because it can draw out anything interesting in the characters themselves. Also, in the original the zombies wanted inside not only to eat the humans but also because they are drawn to the shopping center since is was an important place to them when they were alive.It's a shame that this time around viewers won't get the chance to see zombies wandering around JC Penney or stumbling up and down escalators, the joke being humans amble about aimlessly themselves like the undead at the mall.`Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film but it lacks the superior gory effects from the 1978 movie. That should not stop the squeamish from twitching in their seats due to the horrific content onscreen.Good acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most other horror offerings, but compared to Romero's original it lacks the observations necessary to make it a classic. The first film remains an intelligent critique on human actions during the apocalypse, while this is just a suspense drama that is dressed to kill.8 out of 10 stars. Not as good as Romero's original, but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires.",Dawn of the Dead
231,NateW,A spirited and worthwhile remake,8,31 March 2004,"It may have little in common with its classic predecessor, but this new retelling of George Romero's apocalyptic horror film still has alot to offer. Fans of the genre will not be disappointed, as there is still plenty of blood and gruesome deaths to go around. There's also plenty of claustrophobic chills and suspense that might make you jump out of your seat once or twice. What I liked most about it was that it managed to maintain the humorous spirit of the first Dawn that made it such a dead-on satire of modern society. Those who put it down because it doesn't match up to the original are selling it short. I enjoyed it and it really makes me want to watch the original again to catch things I may have missed the first few times. 8/10",Dawn of the Dead
232,sjmcollins-1,More evidence of horror going back to its roots,7,22 January 2005,"Dawn of the Dead features no survivors, no happy endings, no self-aware dialogue, just straight forward action and horror, and after roughly 8 years of Scream imitations-it's a welcome change. This movie didn't necessarily chill me like George Romero's original Night Of The Living Dead, but that was a bit of a different scenario. Where that one was a few people holed up in a house with dozens of zombies outside, Dawn features an army of hundreds of zombies waiting outside a suburban mall for our dozen or so survivors inside. There are plenty of good old 80's horror movie situations, where you say to yourself ""Why is this idiot doing this?"", but director Zack Snyder doesn't let things get too out of hand, and keeps things as realistic as possible. Michael Kelly (CJ) and Ty Burrell (Steve) offer some funny lines, and Mekhi Phifer (Andre) gives a performance that steadily becomes creepier as the movie goes on. Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later have cemented the return of the zombie film after a long absence.",Dawn of the Dead
233,Sanou_san,Relentlessly Horrifying!,9,22 April 2007,"Wow it's been a long time since I've watched a real zombie-type horror movie. Dawn of the dead is indeed a smash to everyone's disposition, its bloodcurdling, fast phasing, new-fangled, irrefutably not tedious to watch, and a wallop to the movie industry. I guess I wasn't being too exaggerated with my appraisal, but this is the only movie were I saw zombies could scamper hastily towards their victim. Certainly Zack Snyder is a new innovator of horror flick, Dawn of the dead is entirely disturbing talking about its plot and would leave its viewer to wonder and worry what would happen next (even the resolution keeps me anxious). In our conventional experiences zombies that appear in movies are slow-moving flesh eating undead corpses, but Zack Snyder had changed the attributes into a more completely shocking outcome, but in contrast to George Romero's new hit ""Land of the Dead"", Zack Snyder's invention remains on the remnants of zombies' attributesthey do not possess any sorts of intelligence, all they do is a hack a victim and feast on their flesh till nothing is left.On the other hand it bother's me how the characters had passed their anxieties concerning the existence of this undead flesh-eaters, considering that they live in an abandoned mall stuffed with supplies of natural living, it still disturbs me, and all the dead in the world seems to assemble themselves in the said place to out reach their craving for the survivors.If you're a big fan of horror movies, add this immediately to your ghastly collections!",Dawn of the Dead
234,seveleniumus,"Close, but no cigar",5,7 June 2010,"That's how this movie and everything in it felt for me. All the characters were too underdeveloped for me to care about any of them, main protagonist was extremely annoying and not really that well established, too many subplots which have gone nowhere or ended too soon before establishing any kind of emotional attachment. This movie lacks precision and attention to details, you can not just throw random stuff at the viewer without any consistency, anyone can do that, you need to thigh it together, then you'll be creating a MOVIE, not a random mess that we have here. Of course mainstream will be satisfied with any kind of pretty pictures and sadly, for most of the directors that's enough, but that doesn't mean you need to be one of the sheep. Don't believe the hype, see this movie for what it is - another mediocre zombie flick, nothing more, nothing less.",Dawn of the Dead

236,realityinmind,Actually not a bad reboot!,6,25 November 2020,"This movie is a typical movie from the 2000's and follows the format that most reboots use. If I had to compare this to the older versions I would simply say that this has more action and more interpersonal drama. This is definitely not better than the original, but to be honest each movie is completely different. Yes they are the same story, but done in two completely different ways. You really just have to decide what type of movie you are in the mood for... do you want to watch a more suspenseful slow burn? Watch the original one. Do you want more fast-paced action? and character emotion? Watch the reboot.A couple things worth complimenting -- The practical effects and makeup blend well with the CGI, There is a scene where a truck runs over some zombies and I had to rewind and watch a second time because it was done so well. The blood effects are great. The common movie-goer won't know the difference. I mean, there are practical/CGI blended effects in this movie that are far superior to Watchmen, and that movie cost 5 times as much to make. Hell, look at the CGI used in The Dark Knight to show Harvey Dent's Two-Face... even that CGI looked fake, and we all know how much that movie cost. Of course there are even better effects used in much loser budget movies in the Dead series, but this movie has its value.Also -- the cast. A perfect assortment of B-movie actors.... Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, Michael Kelly, Boyd Banks, Jake Weber, and the great Matt Frewer,Overall it is a very standard Hollywood movie that follows all the basic guidelines for a B-movie summer blockbuster.

239,TelevisionJunkie,"Not Romero's vision, but it's not supposed to be",8,12 December 2004,"I must preface this by saying that I am a fan of the original (1978) version of the movie (though to this day, I can't understand the appeal of the original ""Night of the Living...""). Unlike many fans of the original, however, I found this version more than satisfactory. It's been my position for eons that if someone is going to do a remake of a classic film, they need to bring something new to the table -- and that's exactly what the re-makers of ""Dawn of the Dead"" have done. The original went for the satire of consumerism, while this one plays out merely for character pathos and scares. While satire seemed to work for the Romero version (though it ultimately collapsed under its own weight with a silly biker invasion), it simply couldn't work today... at least not as the semi-spoof that the original tried to be.This far-less-intimate version follows the exploits of a gang of people who wind up taking refuge in a shopping mall, whilst hoards of zombies congregate outside of the walls (in the original, the zombies were loose within the mall itself). These zombies are from the ""28 Days Later"" school of zombies -- they move swiftly and are relentless in their hunger for human flesh. While the characters are secondary to the action (particularly in the version I saw at the theatre), all of the actors seem to bring a flair to the characters that they portray. And the ending, which ultimately plays out through the ending credits, is superior to the biker-invasion-cum-escape that Romero left us with in the original version.Minor spoilers for the original: The Romero version featured some scenes that I really miss in this version -- including the infamous screwdriver-through-the-head (though homage was paid with the mallet-through-the-head) and a slide down the the railing of the escalator, but the original was its own entity. Nothing like it had existed before it... and nothing ever will again. Though this version doesn't keep the tight photography and innovative camera angles used in the first version (with many scenes that have been endlessly imitated), it does its best to deliver scares for a new generation. What more can you ask of a remake?",Dawn of the Dead

After the pointless, basically frame-for-frame colour remake of the original Night of The Living Dead in 1990, I wasn't sure remaking the best of the original trilogy was a great idea but Zack Snyder got it spot on. Instead of creating a scene-for-scene remake like the former remake he just takes the basic premise and updates it for a new generation horror audience complete with brilliant scenes of terror, stylish visuals, loads more humour than the original and last but not least buckets of gore. This film was mindlessly entertaining and surpasses the generic self- reflexive formula of recent horror films to deliver a memorable, visceral piece of horror cinema.7/10",Dawn of the Dead

Not only a great work by the novel director Zack Snyder but a great example of performance and acting that show us the value of fantastic and horror movies. Actually this kind of movies have a level of acting very high, and lots of quality. What's the difference between this remake and other zombie movies? Well, is not a comedy but it has funny bits (the first musical number with the Shopping mall robbery) it has drama (like the end of Andy) and the rest of the movie is horror, horror and more horror (Scariest scene: Zombie birth). Sarah Polley does a great work as Anna the nurse, Ving Rhames is a perfect Kenneth, and Zack Snyder the best director to make it.

243,canadude,the mall chainsaw/shotgun/crowbar/spike/hammer/propane/...massacre,3,23 March 2004,"What a great word ""re-imagining"" is. Isn't that what they call Dawn of the Dead MMIV (2004)? A clever word indeed - it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate, ""remake"" that is, and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination. Well, damn, was I misled. At least I was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of ""re-imagining,"" though it played a role.Still, why make a remake? Directors do it for only a few reasons really: to update a movie for a modern audience, or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it. An homage, if you will. Nonetheless, it all generally (I do admit exceptions) boils down to one thing: stealing someone's idea and reshaping it (or ""re-imagining"" it) so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it. It's like Coles'/Cliffs' notes; dump everything in a blender, purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors. In other words, a great marketing scheme.So what's wrong with this one? Well, I'll start with what I liked. I liked the opening scenes. Thanks to CGI and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust Romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means. We see the city in ruins, thousands of zombies: chaos and death. Two words that look beautiful on screen. Then it all falls apart.This set-up leads nowhere. The movie does what almost every remake does. It adds more of everything except character, atmosphere, and story. It's noisier, (in some sense) bloodier, and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots. The setting, the mall which played a crucial role in the original film's story and theme, is purely coincidental. The idea communicated in Romero's film, the pure ecstatic joy of having ""a mall all to yourself as a fortress,"" is gone here. Further, this ""re-imagining"" has no moxie, no spirit, no balls. It assumes (probably quite rightly) that the audience has no attention span and doesn't bother to get us interested in the characters or the story. The film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original. You actually grew to care about those people in Romero's version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall. Here, you don't care when or who goes: what matters is how they go.What else is their to say? The film is not scary. It has one or two ""jump"" scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects. As a story it's really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it. The humor is also reduced to a few one-liners (and one really good character: Andy). After that, what remains? An ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued, inevitable ambiguity of the original film. But, despite it being a pretty bad film (though not quite as bad as some other remakes), it should be remembered for one thing: it kicked The Passion of Christ from it's number one spot in the box office. Well done zombies.",Dawn of the Dead

When I heard it was being re-made, I rolled my eyes. The original was fine, thank you very much. I missed the theatrical release, and just saw the uncut version on DVD. What makes DAWN OF THE DEAD so good is that at no time does it draw comparison to the original. Although the basic story line is the same, the style and interpretation is so different, that DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) earns it's place in history independent of the original. For a remake, that is unheard of. It's one of the best remakes I have ever seen, along with THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (2005). If you are curious about the WORST remake in the history of cinema, check out PSYCHO (1998). DAWN OF THE DEAD benefits from an outstanding cast, lead by Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames.

Now, with this film and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, there's a good blend of classic horror stories done with a current film-making-style attitude. There are two things I really liked about this movie: 1) They don't try to explain anything. You never know why the zombies exist, where it started, etc... You don't need to, that's not the point. and 2) The running zombies. Purists HATE it. They want the old ""zombie shuffle."" What the hell is scary about that? How hard is it to outrun or drive away from shuffling zombies?!? This way, they're scary. More intense.

249,pwoods1,A remake as enjoyable as the original?,8,25 October 2004,"The horror genre is, at times, a contentious mix of everything from the sublime to the ridiculous. I know that's a well-worn cliché, but it is true perhaps more for this genre than for others. Audiences will often stay away in droves and consign otherwise good movies to cult status simply because they ARE remakes: indeed, often just because they are classified as horror. And let's face it - some remakes are woeful; some horror flix miss the point that INTENTIONAL humour and INTENTIONAL textual references add to the enjoyment. Even irony gets lost in the drive to be as gory as possible. The suspension of disbelief is made easier if there is at least a semblance of plot line and, in these days of fear re the use of biochemical and bacteriological weapons by terrorists, any film using same NEEDS humour to ensure the audience doesn't go home and commit mass suicide.Dawn of the Dead (2004) is one of the best remakes ever. Zack Snyder has created something new - a juxtaposition, if you will, between the original screenplay, new editing techniques, and a fresh, vibrant cast.Who is Sarah Polley? She gives a great performance as Ana. Ving Rhames is excellent as is Michael Kelly as CJ. Overall, an inspired casting of all the characters. We really FEEL for all of them and thus get ""sucked-in"" to engage with each. What happens to them means something.The cinematography is excellent. Perhaps my only criticism would be the lack of unusual perspectives, i.e. unusual camera angles. This, of course, is more to do with costing than intent. One can only do so much within the strictures established by the bean-counters. However, Snyder and crew do a bloody-good job. (Pun intended.)It is interesting, to say the least, that the dog becomes a central part of both the action and the pathos.Sorry.

251,dispet,highly entertaining horror fest,9,17 June 2004,"it was good, I've given it a 9 out of 10 rating. it has its flaws, the script has some plot retardedness, there was a complete lack of any human devouring going on except for one little ""cleverly"" edited scene (hardly even got to see any biting action), the characters werent as good as the original because there were like 20 of them instead of 4. but otherwise, it did what it set out to do, it gave us a hell of a lot of things which have been missing from the zombie film and was competently put together. some scenes were actually quite effectively horrorific even. the long shots, where they just pulled the camera right back out and showed shots of the entire city and/or landscape, were infused with a certain dread and horror that has rarely been captured in other zombie films. the credits at the beginning were nifty, but so not scary. it was tooooo mtv style to be scary, you know, hey look every 5 seconds we'll flash a close up of zombies on screen and you'll jump out of your seat!..... uhuh, don't think so. occasionally they let the idea that high impact speed horror is more scary than lingering knowledge horror get the better of them and it degraded scenes which couldve been much better. but, there were very few actual flaws with the film, and i think most people would thoroughly enjoy it. but yes, no entrails. no devouring of bodies. which for me, unfortunately, made it a little too much like 28 days later. the actions of the zombies became just brutal bashing violence, like 28 days later. it COMPLETELY lacked the absolute fear of being devoured and swallowed up by these creatures. the fear generated by this film is just nerve ending fear, you never feel it in your bones. but it was still damn good, and I'm sure i will enjoy it even more the second time round. and one should keep an eye out for how many exploitation movie references you can pick up on. wasn't so much references to particular films, but just ideas and styles that are classic 70s 80s exploitation, gotta love that cannibal holocaust scene :D although most people will think its just trying to rip off blair witch....*sigh*",Dawn of the Dead
252,ADOZER200,Can't kill an original,6,29 March 2004,"I saw Dawn of the Dead years ago at a sleep over and I thought it was the greatest zombie flick of all time. This is the movie that got me interested into the horror genre even more than I was. I have seen so many other zombie flicks and not one came close to Dawn of the Dead. Night of the Living Dead and Return of the Living Dead were good and Demons 1 and 2 were pretty awesome, but nothing ever came close to Dawn of the Dead. When I heard about the remake I was exstatic! I was so excited and I couldn't wait. When I finally saw the remake this past weekend it was good but not nearly great like the original. I did not expect too much because of nowadays horror movies but I expected it to be a little better than it was. I thought it was enterataining enough to keep me in my seat but I am not willing to see it again. Fans will be dissapointed because of how much is missing. I would also like to know something else. When did zombies start running marathons???",Dawn of the Dead
253,silentcheesedude,OK zombie action film,7,5 June 2005,"A pack of humans barricade themselves in a mall, when it becomes apparent that the dead are now zombies, walking the earth, and in need of flesh to eat.When the first 'Dawn' came out in the 70's, it was a pretty original zombie film. It depicted a social satire, comparing us with the zombies. We are, after all, a world run by advertisements, by TV, and by everyone else in the media. Why not wind up in the mall with everyone else? Zombies are shown in all their glory, moaning and groaning about. They are as much part of the movies as the humans are, and there's even a bit of humor about them.But not in the new version. The social message is thrown away, for the most part. Zombies in here are secondary. There's nothing funny about them. But there's plenty of action, and that's what this movie boils down to, an action packed-zombie fest.So we are really looking at 2 different films here, with the only relationship being is that the humans shut themselves in a mall for safety. The earlier version is more violent & scarier, if a bit more preachy. I also liked the ending of the first one far better then this one. I won't reveal, but it's a distinctive flavor between possible hope and utter despair.But those looking for a violent zombie action movie can't go wrong with this. It's better then Resident Evil, IMHO.If you get the DVD, don't miss some of the extras ""The Lost Tape: Over 15 Minutes of Terrifying Footage Revealed"", where poor Andy shows us in a video his last few days of life.Now, If your looking for a better 'zombie' type of movie, take a look at '28 days Later'",Dawn of the Dead
254,Scorching,Nothing great,7,18 June 2004,"Well I gotta admit I was rather excited to watch this movie a few days ago. The reviews on the film were good and some hype like those for The Ring were present. Viewers in the US seemed to love it. So much so that it actually beat out The Passion Of The Christ for top spot in the US box office when it opened. Well as I was watching the movie I was waiting for it to pick up and really scare me. I gotta admit I was not that impressed with the film. I thought story line was a little to ordinary and didn't seem too original. Some of the events just didn't feel right. Some of the other elements they tried to inject such as drama when they had to kill one of the bitten humans and the comedy just didn't feel right.I thought the effects were good enough. Most of the zombies looked realistic. Action sequences were also good enough but nothing amazing.
I guess I was just expecting too much from this film but when it failed I was throughly disappointed",Dawn of the Dead
255,paulnewman2001,Better than expected,6,13 October 2004,"George Romero's 1978 Dawn Of The Dead is one of the best horror films ever, a grim, bloody and apocalyptic satire of consumerism, and remaking it sounded a thoroughly cynical move, so it's all the more surprising the end result is so enjoyable.The original film is essentially stripped back to its title, shopping mall location, three cameos and some in-jokes (although it still supplies all the best lines).In place of satire and shambling cadavers, director Zack Snyder goes for ironically juxtaposed songs and sprinting zombies modeled on the infected from 28 Days Later.Dawn 2003 eventually finds its own identity in a welter of meaty gore effects and one excellent escape attempt in armoured camper vans towards the end, which makes it all the more disappointing it chose to ride on the coat-tails of a giant rather than ditch the mall setting and lurch on its own two feet as the perfectly serviceable, pulse-pounding zombie frightener it is.",Dawn of the Dead
256,plumberguy66,WOW! That's all I can say,10,1 April 2004,"Ok there's more..In the thick soup of seventies remakes one stands out above the rest. Dawn of the Dead. Not only is this movie far superior to the original but it is IMHO, The BEST zombie/post apocalyptic/horror movie I have ever seen. True, and I've seen a lot. I'll warn you if spoilers are coming.  The opening of Dawn of the Dead is quite intense and brutal gouts of blood, people running and screaming, zombies (of course) doing their thing and then the credits start to run and you just know you are in for one hell of a ride. I swear, I got goose bumps in anticipation of things to come. Dawn of the Dead works on so many levels I can't cover them all but suffice to say that it manages to be brutal and terrifying while injecting splashes of poignancy and gentleness. Sarah Polly has led me down the rabbit-hole before with movies like GO and No Such Thing; she takes us (willing) on a new, nightmarish ride and delivers the goods as usual. I think she is one of the best, most beautiful actresses today. For me, being familiar with, and liking, her past work made it easy for me to like/care for her character right from the get-go. This helped tremendously with getting sucked into the atmosphere. You can tell all the actors really got into making this picture. It must have been great fun. Ving is as great as always. But the real kudos have to go to the director and cinematography While the premise is disturbing enough and the actors veterans, I'm not sure it would have been as effective without the, up-in-your-face, shaky camera work. A lot of the film is shot in close, claustrophobic intimacy and then there are these shaky, off-focus, chaotic shots that put right in the think of the fight and violence, then wide panoramic shots that show you the full scope of this desperate situation. Some parts of this movie are nothing less than brilliant. I love true artistry in film and it delivers that as well. Great special effects, smart story elements, attention to detail (listen to the mall Muzak  perfect) simply a great movie going experience. I will accept no arguments on this.  Perfect 10.",Dawn of the Dead
257,DjfunkmasterG,New DAWN will Have it's Day!,9,12 March 2004,"DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) Sarah Polley Ving Rhames Mekhi Phifer Jake Weber Rated R Running Time 100 mins Universal Studios
I recently watched Dawn of the Dead at the world premiere in Los Angeles California. If you don't already know, Dawn of the Dead is a remake of the 1978 George A. Romero Classic of the same name. Well this dawn is more of a Re-Envisioning, than a remake.This new Dawn of the Dead is more supercharged than the film that inspired it. Award winning Commercial Director Zach Snyder, making his feature Debut here, brings back the Dead in this update of the Romero Classic. The story is not a shot for shot remake, but rather a totally new story using elements from the Original film. James Gunn (Scooby Doo, Tromeo & Juliet) scripted the new Dawn and has endure some harsh criticism from fans of the original film. This update brings a more fierce zombie to the fold....a Relentless killer if you will. Like Romero's Zombies...the new dawn zombies need to feed on Human Flesh. However the difference between Zombies of the original and the new are the zombies characteristics. Romero's were Slow...Zack's are Fast.SPOILER ALERTThe New Dawn uses the same elements of the original while telling a different story. We have zombies, Survivor's, & a Mall. The story picks up the day before a large Wisconsin Town gets blasted by the zombie plauge which is sweeping the nation. Our main character is Ana (Sarah Polley) a nurse and loving wife whom we see finishing up her day at work so she can get home to her husband for ""DATE"" night, During Date Night They miss the special news Bulletin on TV explaining how dire the situation is becoming. After a Night of passion with her hubby we find them in bed the next morning. Soon Ana will witness the carnage about to overtake the earth. A neighorhood girl has gotten into the home and attacked Ana's husband as Ana tries to help him she finds out the world is falling apart and when her Husband returns from the dead Ana has to escape. During Ana's Escape we see her neighborhood in ruins, the city she lives in, in total Chaos.The Film has different characters from diferent social Situations. We have millionaire playboy Steve Markus (TY BURRELL), Stoic police officer Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Street wise Husband and soon to be father Andre (Mekhi Phifer) his wife Luda (Inna Korobkina) Tough as Nails Security guard Cj (Michael Kelley) and Newly Hired Security Guard Terry (Kevin Zegers). Some of the best performances in the film don't come from the Top Billed stars but yet the supporting cast. TY BURRELL's Character Steve markus is a real treat in this film. TY really stole the show. his character is the typical don't lift a finger , but make a comment on everything decision the group makes. You are supposed to hate this guy, but you end up liking him just because of how cynical he is, TY is great addition to the cast.Michael Kelley who plays CJ, also another great member of the cast, Here is someone your supposed to hate and you do, you really really do. However unlike TY's character Michael comes around towards the end of the film and begins to work with group when it comes time to leave the safe confines of the mall.Mekhi Phifer, Usually type cast as a street tough thug turns in a great performance as a streetwise husband who is now thinking about Heaven and Hell, and wonders where his place will be at the end of the situation the survivor's are faced with. Mekhi could have really shined...but some poor editing choices more or less neutralized his performance, it didn't hurt it, but it did take way from it.one of the Performances I was looking forward too was that of VING RHAMES. Ving's character, Kenneth, A police officer who is trying his best to get to the local military base to find his brother was not what I expected. I really enjoy Ving Rhames's work in film...however the feel of someone longing to get to his brother didn't hit me, I didn't feel his pain. It really wasn't a believable performance. Now, Ving's character really shines when introduced to another survivor whom is across the mall parking lot, ANDY, the owner of Andy's gun shop and great marksman finds himself communication back and forth with the mall citizens Via Binoculars and dry erase boards. The exchanges between Andy and Kenneth are some of the best moments in the film. Those scenes really highlight Ving's character.The Zombies.....Well what can ya say about zombies. One quote would be ""yeah they're dead...they're.... all messed up"". taken from the screenplay of the original Night of the living Dead. These Zombies are not your normal Slow moving dead things. The New Zombies are Supercharged and come off more like the infected from 28 days later. This new breed of zombie is scary, but they don't have their own characteristics...they are just Zombies whom move really fast. I wish the production would have done the zombies more like Dan O'Bannon's Zombies from the original Return of the living Dead, but they chose the 28 days later style and that is ok...The supercharged zombie is the new zombie monster of the new millenium. In this case...i like the original George A. Romero Zombies...Slow movers.The camera work and story move fast...some of the story gets lost in the process but hey, this isn't Oscar worthy material anyway. This is supposed to be a Fun Horror/Popcorn Movie and it is, lets just see how it holds up against time.Although Flawed by Poor Editing...The new Dawn of the Dead is Enjoyable on many levels. This Dawn will have a place in Horror film history.my Grade  B-",Dawn of the Dead

259,Craig-9,Amazingly good movie,8,22 March 2004,"I went to both _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ and _Dawn of the Dead_ yesterday, and while I was expecting the former to be a great movie, I really didn't know what to expect from the latter. Surprisingly, of the two, the one that sticks in my mind is _Dawn of the Dead_. As others have noted, this really is a superior remake, in many ways better than the original--better acting, better effects, etc. Now I know the original is a classic, but this remake was just outright horrifying from beginning to end. It is doom-laden and edge-of-your-seat scary. I haven't had so much fun at a movie in a long, long time and when it was done, I wanted to see it again right away. Sarah Polley and Jake Webber are great and Ving Rhames lends able support. Mekhi Phifer is good as the young father slowly losing his mind in the aftermath of the breakdown of society. The movie is gruesome and very convincing in depicting an absolute breakdown--the first 30 minutes or so are just unrelenting in setting the scene and getting the audience in the mood--cars run over pedestrians, houses are on fire, you can't really tell who's friendly or who's a foe. I'll admit I didn't expect a whole lot from this movie, but it was just out and out fantastic! Highly recommended, if you've got the stomach for it.",Dawn of the Dead
260,Finntroll,Good remake.,7,20 August 2004,"Zack Snyder. Who is this guy? I've never heard the name before and yet he has managed to make the best remake in recent times. ""Dawn of the dead"" has always been one of my favorite zombie flicks, so naturally it should be impossible to better it, at least by remaking it. I can't really say that the remake is better than the original in any way but it's stands for itself.The tempo, compared to the old movie, is very high. The movie kicks off even before you know it. I somehow feel the movie could have been better if it was a little slower, since you often get to know people for about a second before they turn into zombies. Also the zombies run around like someone has filled their pants with fire-ants, which is a bit sad. I mean zombies are supposed to be slow and stupid.The FX are well made and the atmosphere is reasonably chilling. Whereas the old movie was a clever satire of the consumption and materialistic needs of our society this is more of a full frontal action/horror movie which makes it a lot less original but it's still made in such a good way that it smacks most of the opposition on the fingers.So, while it's not a patch on the original it's a pretty fine movie on it's own and probably the best remake this side of ""The Fly"". And by the way, gorehounds will not be disappointed.7/10",Dawn of the Dead

263,c_p_c,The Sun's Up Here!!!,6,31 March 2004,"This year seems to be the Year of the Horror Movie Remake.  Beginning with TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE back in October, and now with DAWN OF THE DEAD, many can only imagine what other concepts are being thought up.However, if any future remake has the stamina that this remake has, then the horror genre may revive itself.  DAWN OF THE DEAD is in no sense a breakthrough movie with an inventive plot.  Actually we never learn of the reason zombies exist in the first place (it is a remake of the follow up of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, where the plot is revealed).  But it is the excitement and relentlessness that this film brings about it.From the fun and intense opening to the finale (which is a little predictable, I should add I have never seen the original all the way through), there is always something going on.The actors in this film, while several of them have names (particularly Ving Rhames and Mekhi Pheifer), are all decent in the parts they play.  They each offer something different to the movie.The message of consumerism that spawned from the first one is still used here, but not does not remain a main focus.For having a great sense of style, some intense scenes, and overall fun DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) rates as a  6/10.",Dawn of the Dead
264,KillerCadugen,Ferocious,9,22 March 2004,"What a ferocious horror movie! This is a remake basically in name only (with a few of the original concepts tossed in); Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a straightforward survival horror adventure - and a brutally intense one at that (not since the first Jurassic Park have I found myself trying to slip down into my seat and shield myself from what was going on up on the screen). To be perfectly honest, I was not 100% pleased - POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD! - that the zombies were able to run and be so violent and I was not 100% pleased that it was a virus, rather than radiation, which caused the zombie plague (making it almost more of a homage to 28 Days Later than the original Dawn of the Dead), but these are quibbling matters. This was a superb horror movie and will probably do so well we will be seeing another spate of remakes on the way.",Dawn of the Dead
265,edwjoolee,A worthy remake...,8,14 July 2005,"I loved the original Dawn of the Dead. I remember seeing it as a young kid and being fascinated, shocked, repulsed and excited by the imageries shown in that film. The movie represented for me at the time everything that was adult and taboo.The new remake is a complete makeover of the original: it is made for the MTV generation, with fast editing, quick pacing and unrelenting action. In other words, the new DOD is intended for mass consumption. And that is not a bad thing if it is done right, and, in my opinion, the new DOD gets it right.There are more characters than in the original. And the new film clocks in at way below the two hour mark, whereas, if my memory serves me right, the original ran much longer than 2 hrs. The new version, therefore, lacks clearly defined characters, and the pacing of the film seems somewhat rushed under the limited time constraint.However, the film is a hoot. It is briskly paced and the action sequences are furious at times. Also, it is a scary film. What the film lacks in characterization, it wholly makes up for it by turning the action meter on up high.Undeniably, there will be die-hard fans of the original who will dismiss the new version as a needless remake. That is their right, and I support their right to their opinions. However, the new DOD is entertaining in its own right, i.e., as a divergent, action-oriented horror film.",Dawn of the Dead
266,dieseldemon85,Better than expected,7,4 April 2021,"This film was on a 4 feature dvd I bought from the bargain shop. The first two I watched were below average, so I went into this one expecting the same. It's decently acted, contains a few Canadian actors, the makeup and effects were top notch, and storyline was good. The film ran 1h:35 min which is a good length as with these features you tend to lose interest after a 2 hr time. If you like zombie films, check this one out.",Dawn of the Dead
267,drunken_critic,Apocalyptic delight,8,3 April 2005,"I absolutely love movies about the apocalypse. I'm sorry, but I find it absolutely romantic to watch movies about the end of the world. Yeah, I know I am crazy, but it is my weird fetish. This movie did not disappoint. The first 20 minutes of this movie was absolutely horrifying. I could literally feel my blood pressure and my heart rate climb to fear induced levels. Yes, I was actually scared, and my body was responding to it. It is crazy to be attacked by someone you love. In this movie her own husband and a trusted girl attack the main character Sara. I loved it when she ran out of her house to escape to see the whole city in chaos. Her neighbor was pointing a gun at her, and all the houses were on fire. Her neighbors were being slaughtered right in front of her. It made the hair on my neck stand up! The first 20 minutes of the move had me hooked. She escapes the situation and gets together with survivors at the local mall. Unfortunately the rest of the movie was situated in the mall. I would have preferred a movie where the characters were continuously on the run, (similar to 28 Days). The mall scenes were mildly scary, but the situation was different in the mall. The mall gave the characters a sense of security that lessened the fear of the situation. The mall kept the ""living dead"" out, and it gave the characters a security that actually made me relax. I would have like them to be put in uncomfortable situations throughout the movie. I felt that they were given too much control. The mall was a barrier between the living and the dead, and I feel that the barrier should have been blurred. Beyond my negativity, I still feel that this movie was an above average horror movie. I wish I had monitors hooked up to me during this movie. There were certain scenes that would have caused the monitors to go off in ""code blue"" mode. I can say that I was scared at moments, and I feel that a movie has succeeded if it can cause emotion such as panic.I would like to add I was the only person that stayed in the theater to see the end credits. The end credits showed what happened when the boat reached the island. Freaking' Awesome ending! It was the most exciting end credits I have seen in a movie.",Dawn of the Dead
268,medic249a2,Remake that's its own movie,8,12 July 2004,"I think that when Zack Snyder undertook this project, he realized just what he was trying to remake. Romero's original 'Dawn' would be hard, if not impossible, to duplicate, and to try to do so would likely enrage countless Romero fans. So he wisely tried to make this 'Dawn' its own movie, with a few notable differences. Most differences add to and enhance the film.***WARNING!! SPOILER ALERT***A pretty young nurse named Ana (Sarah Polley) returns home from her hospital job, just as we get a hint of what is coming; a patient at her hospital admitted for a minor injury is in ICU - with an unknown problem. When she returns home to her husband Louis, they spend a romantic night in the shower while the TV flashes an emergency broadcast...The next morning Louis wakes up to discover their next door neighbor, a little girl, standing in their doorway. When Louis gets up to investigate, he is attacked and killed by her. Ana wakes up to discover Louis bleeding heavily from a bite wound. and he rapidly succumbs to his injury. When Ana tries to call for help, 911 replies 'all circuits are busy'; the world is falling apart. In seconds Louis is on his feet, hungrily coming after Ana. She manages to escape to her car and flee, and as she does, her suburb is swarming with police and ambulances, as well as people running everywhere. As she gets onto the freeway she is forced to stop at an accident, and on a nearby city bus she sees two hideous zombies feed on a third. After crashing her car, a policeman (Ving Rhames) discovers & rescues her. They make their way to a mall with 3 other people, including a man (Mekhi Pfifer of ER) and his expectant girlfriend. They hole themselves up in the mall as the world falls apart around them; TVs in the mall show the problem is as far afield as England, India, and the Middle East. Outside the mall, mobs of undead zombies try to get in - to feast on the living...***END SPOILERS***The first 20 minutes were an excellent take on this classic; showing the world falling apart as the mysterious plague spreads uncontrollably was something that was only hinted at in Romero's original. Some of the characters, such as the obnoxious guard C.J., were probably unnecessary, though C.J.'s character gradually develops through the movie from a self-centered man to one who sacrifices himself to let the others get away. Most 'Dawn' watchers may remember Gaylen Ross' pregnancy in the original; this one takes it a bit further with the birth of the zombie baby, after its mother becomes a zombie. It was interesting to see some of the original 'Dawn' actors in cameo roles; Tom Savini as the sheriff; Scott Reininger as an army colonel; and Ken Foree as a preacher, stating his line from the original 'Dawn' - ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"".**** out of *****",Dawn of the Dead
269,derekauthor,An excellent remake!,9,22 August 2005,"Even though this remake to George A. Romero's 1978 classic, it still packs quite a punch. Personally, I was expecting to walk into the theater disliking it because many remakes aren't as good as the originals.I was wrong. There were some parts in the movie where I found myself on the edge of my seat, almost shivering and sweating. My heart was pounding, too. I've seen plenty of horror movies in my time and those feelings have never bothered me. It was very interesting that those symptoms of nervousness came about. I mean, I was just expecting a zombie to pop out from behind a corner during some of those scenes.I'm also happy that it had a fast pace and immediately got to the point without seeming too ambitious. It also did a good job of making it realistic (or as realistic as a zombie movie can be). After all, it wasn't like they filmed George A. Romero's script again, bringing back the same characters and occurrences. They did, however, keep the concept of consumerism Romero satirized in his version of ""Dawn of the Dead.""I recommend this to anyone who likes horror movies (or those who specifically enjoy zombie movies), or wants a good thrill.First-time director Zack Snyder appears as a soldier in front of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., during the beginning credits -- for those of you who love movie trivia.",Dawn of the Dead
270,k844140,Good zombie movie,7,3 July 2021,"It is always risky to shoot a remake of the film which started the genre (well, it wasn't the first film about zombies, but the first which resembles recent ones), and Zack Snyder succeeded in it. Why is it risky and hard? Because the film which starts the genre always sets some rules which all the films of this genre follow. In this film we see absolutely the same as in other zombie movies, whether they are new or old ones: people try to save themselves from zombies, conflict and get bitten. Very frequent trick is also showing that people are bigger monsters than zombies, which is also present in this movie. By the way, because of some bad security guys which appear in the beginning of the movie, I first thought this will be a cliche zombie movie. And though sometimes it is, it has numerous strong sides. Actors are pretty good and their characters are diverse. Here we have strong woman nurse character, a couple of freak guards, one of which saves everyone in the end, young couple of teens who want to be inseparable, interesting sniper Andy, responsible policeman, weird man who ties his pregnant zombie wife to give birth to a zombie child and rich selfish guy Steve. This different characters are quite well represented and you understand every one of them, though there is a lot of characters and film is not that long. This is due to a decent script for a zombie horror. My favorite characters are Sarah Polley's and Ving Rhames' ones. The plot is quite gripping in the end, and basically film gets more and more interesting each 20 minutes. Beginning is a typical zombie horror opening, but in the end due to good character development and some interesting moments it gets much better. Directing of Snyder is decent enough in this film as well. Thanks for the R rating which made film more realistic.Summing up I can say that though it's not a masterpiece for me, it surely is one of the best zombie movies of 00's and you can spend a good evening watching it. If you like zombie movies you can appreciate it much more than I do.",Dawn of the Dead
271,Cube_TX,"Action rather than horror, but worthy remake",7,20 March 2004,"As a HUGE fan of the original Dawn of the Dead I was very skeptical of this remake.  I wasn't expecting an Academy Award winning blockbuster or anything, but I did want to see the remake do the original justice.  I was impressed with the filming more than anything.  This is an action movie rather than horror.  The outdoor scenes are filmed with a grainy, hand-held camera which gave the audience the feeling of being disoriented much the same way the characters would have felt.  The movie was not made in the MTV-generation style that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was.  Dawn of the Dead stuck to the same mythology of the first without giving it a complete reimagining.  I could imagine the two movies co-existing, but in different parts of the world.One of the key differences that I did like was the idea of the zombies running.  This made them come across as more menacing rather than being the slow clunkers that are seen in the original trilogy.  The idea of being able to walk right past them was abandoned.  I also feel that the movie did a good job of showing how quickly people would turn on one another and watch out for themselves only.One of my favorite ""realisms"" of the movie is how the characters are too attached to their loved ones to shot them when they become zombies.  I'm certain that many of us would react in the same manner if something like this were to actually happen (yes, I know it's impossible).  Also, it was interesting to have so many people make it to the mall instead of only four as in the original.  Of course some of these characters fit the generic stereotype of a movie such as this, but I'm not surprised considering modern audiences would need such characters to maintain their interest.  This was a movie made for film viewers, not film makers.  We have the strong and silent male hero, the quick-thinking blond heroine, the official dumb jerk, the official slut, the young and naive girl who loses everything and needs the group's protection, the angry challenger for group leadership who has a change of heart and becomes heroic, the young trainee who disagrees with the angry challenger yet follows due to a sense of duty, and the stupid follower who gets his comeuppence.One aspect that was missing from this remake was the original movie's social commentary on the commercialism of people.  Ken Foree's character of Peter mentioned this in the original whereas Ving Rhames' Kenneth was more of a silent action hero never having much to say.  This was another reason that I saw this as a simple action movie -- though I will say that Rhames has more acting ability than Governor Schwarzenegger, Sly, Seagal and Van Damme combined.  Rhames also LOOKS like an action hero rather than today's prettyboy ""action heroes"" such as Tom Cruise, Ben Affleck, Nicolas Cage and Keanu Reeves -- who all look like they couldn't fight their way out of a cooking class for senior citizens.All in all this movie was not better than the original and won't be nominated for any Academy Awards, but if you're looking for entertainment and can stomach the blood it's worth checking out.  I can't wait to buy it on DVD someday.",Dawn of the Dead
272,pauldavidnaylor-42552,Was this a remake?,4,15 April 2021,Okay dawn of the dead this was rather insane and its not like the 78 original in this 2004 remake the zombies ran and jumped im like WHAT! Zombies couldn't even speak never mind running no wonder George Romero complained about other film directors being in his back garden for me George Romero will always resonate with me as the father of the Zombie genre. The zombies didn't even look like zombies but more like rabid individuals.,Dawn of the Dead

It felt good to be stunned, sit in a stupor and miss most of the 'action', like REALLY good. I felt like one of those 'zombies' I guess, I'm sure they were stupefied at how this epic turned out.Multilayered like a nappy, deep like bubbling intestines, fermenting and ready to launch. A few moments at the very very beginning showed promise but after 5 minutes it's been diarrhoea all the way to the end. And no-one had the courage to wipe afterwards.",Dawn of the Dead

275,Jeddia,Zombirific! Well done.,10,19 March 2004,"Like many, I found myself anxious about the news that Dawn was being remade. I wasn't particularly worried about the choice of director or screenwriter (like some outspoken folks).  I was more concerned with the ""uber-stupid-teenification"" that seems to haunt most of the decent ideas that surface in cinema nowadays - particularly in horror films.That said, there were a couple instances in the new Dawn that I could've lived without.  But they were easily forgotten amidst the ruthless spectacle of these very determined survivors in a shopping mall.Romero fans and newcomers alike should be pleased.  The violence is huge, but the gore wasn't over the top as I had expected it would be.  It was simply very well done.And for all of you people who are upset over the running zombies, just get over it already.  I'm a big fan of the original movies.  But the bottom line is this:  lumbering, staggering, slow-moving zombies just aren't scary anymore folks.  They scare your grandma, but not us anymore.  It's been almost 30 years.  We have to be ... ""re-shocked"" into believing in the bleak, almost unbearable truth that anyone alive during the Dawn of the Dead apocalypse...is in deep doodoo.As a huge fan of the genre, I give it 10 outta 10.  Hopefully we'll see more of it soon.",Dawn of the Dead
276,ForReal84,This dawn is no yawn,8,27 March 2004,"DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) is one of the best remakes or re-envisioning of a classic film. Actually this is not a remake at all, everything is different expect for the title and the whole mall idea. While I am a huge fan of the original and I believe that it is stupid and a waste of time to revisit an old idea, I found this film to be better then the original concept. I can't imagine what it would be like if something like this were to happen in `real' life. I'm happy that this hasn't happened yet, but it is quite an experience watching it happen to a group of characters. When I first heard that there was going to be another film called Dawn of the Dead, I was hoping that it was not going to be in any way connected to the one that I have seen a million times. I mean if you saw the remake of the original Night of the Living Dead, then you may know what I'm talking abouttalk about a waste of time, that was one of the worst films I have ever seen. But back to the new Dead, I saw the first ten minutes of the film air on the USA network a couple of days ago and from then on I was hooked. It stopped right after the main character Ana crashes her car into a tree. Sitting in the theater I couldn't wait for that to finish so I could see the rest of the film. Believe me I was not let down, I think that this is an awesome movie filled with some great scares and a few laughs. So many times horror films lose steam half way through the film, but Dawn only built up steam. From the first ten minutes one can get a sense that this is going to be a fast paced film, and see that there is not going to be much time to breath. I also found all of the characters to be very interesting, although I thought there were a few too many characters. In the original there are four people who must survive, but in the remake there are a lot more people that we have to watch out for. Many of them were just there to stand in the back, and were cause for a great death scene. After a hard day's work the only thing that Ana wanted was some r and r, but what she got was a whole different story. The film takes us on a wild ride in the lives of a group of strangers who come together to fight for their lives. After awaking to a horrifying sight, Ana must escape from the man that she has come to know and love. Soon Ana finds herself with of group of other desperate strangers who take refugee in a near by shopping mall. Inside the mall the meet three security guards and take in a rig full of helpless outsiders looking for a safe base. Inside the mall they keep out the living dead and try to go on with their lives while waiting for help. As everyone one knows that all good things must come to an end, so the group which has been downsized, decide to escape the mall and travel to an island where they can rebuild their broken lives. Now with a plan in hand a small group of the living must outsmart a large group of the dead.
Usually in most horror films there are up and coming actors (who can't act scared if a zombie bit them in the ass) who are living in their fifteen minutes of fame. Rarely do we get the treat of watching a group of talented actors scream their way through a film, well in this fright fest we are exposed to a group of very talented actors. Playing Ana, Sarah Polley delivers a strong performance playing an even stronger character. Her mix of rage and beauty helps her to take charge of the screen. Ving Rhames, whom I believe to be one of the most underrated actors, take charge in this film. He is an amazing actor and turns in another solid performance. Jake Weber and Mekhi Phifer play too very different characters and are very believable in their roles. Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth, who are reuniting a second time on screen after their small roles in another excellent horror film WRONG TURN, play their characters in unique ways. For Zegers, who has few lines, he is very demanding when he is one screen and Booth, plays the helpless girl to a tee. While all of the other actors deserve to be mentioned I think that by saying they all do an excellent job is fair enough, because many times audiences are not paying attention to the performances the actors are giving anyway.Dawn of the Dead truly is a film worth seeing. There are good performances, a solid recreation of a classic, an awesome score, many scares, and even a few laughs. If you haven't seen it go see it right now stop reading get in your car and goif not for anything else go to at least check out the ending. Dawn has one of the best endings to a horror movie that I have seen in a long time it is scary and original. I am going to give Dawn of the Dead 3.7 stars out of 4 and an A-!",Dawn of the Dead

279,Theshapeshifter,Zombies in mirror are closer than they appear...,9,9 October 2005,"When I first rented this film, I was astounded. Simply astounded. I found this film to be the best zombie film that I had seen in ages. The effects were amazing, and the story was riveting.In the film, it appears as though a young woman works as a nurse who wakes up one morning and finds out that almost every single person is a flesh-eating zombie who wishes to bite the other people that they too, may be the undead. With this happening, she drives off, hoping to escape, but crashes her car, only to be rescued by a police officer, a pregnant woman and her husband, and a man who once sold televisions. The five seek refuge in a mall, and are almost refused by some security guards, who the five civilians imprison to save themselves, and save a truckload of some refugees who escaped the zombies' wrath, when they lock up the place. With this, the zombies stay tirelessly and relentlessly outside of the mall in the hopes of capturing the people inside, while the people themselves have a multitude of conflicts within the building.This film is clearly for those who enjoy a horror with a plot twist in it. One such flaw with this film is that it depicts zombies in a different direction than that which most fans are acclimated to seeing. While the story itself has its weak points, it is not without its good sides.",Dawn of the Dead
280,DashTheGreat,"Intentionally bad, and somewhat funny.",9,3 August 2007,"(Spoilers be ahead)Yeah, that's right. I thought that this movie would suck, and be a 20 minute turn off. I will willingly now eat crow. DotD was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be, which was pleasantly surprising. First and foremost, it was insanely graphic; almost a given with all zombie movies. We're also pretty much thrown right into the plot (which is unscary, but it was never meant to be), where a nurse, two black cops, and a couple of other characters that were the usual zombie-movie stock characters were thrown in. There's always the good looking blond, her boyfriend, the egotistical jerk who everyone wants to get offed as a guilty pleasure (*cough *cough, boat captain guy), and the old couple that somehow stumbled in but won't live very long. I will compliment the filmmakers, however. As another commenter said, this is a remake that didn't fall apart. The ending is cliché, but it was supposed to be. Anything else would ruin the movie. And now, that's got me thinking. What if Chuck Norris were cast into this flick and replaced with the sniper that Ving kept writing signs to. As soon as those zombies jumped through the shoot, they would be gonners for sure. Would Chuck need a razorwire truck with a chain saw? No way. Instead, Chuck would jump off of the ammo shop roof after eating 1000 AK-47 rounds and grenades for breakfast, and would take the zombies on with brass knuckles and flatulence. After racking up a quadruple digit body count, Norris would make a gigantic wall out of the dead zombies, allowing the characters to get to safety. In the end, he would unearth the body of John Wayne, who would no doubt shoot hundreds of nukes and obliterate the zombies into pixie dust, and all is well.",Dawn of the Dead
281,Emphinix,"A quite decent movie, but with many flaws",5,4 December 2007,"Although the storyline of this movie was decent, there are too many flaws, but do not read if you have not seen the movie, because some things I might say, might spoil it for you. Before I tell what the flaws are, I gotta say that I am not a very big fan of remakes of the original, almost nothing is original made these days, because we got adaptations and remakes all over Hollywood.The tagline of the original and the remake is: ""When there is no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the Earth"". In my opinion for this movie is: ""When there are no more fresh ideas in Hollywood, the lazy shall make a god-awful remake"".Now I gotta say the flaws that this movie has: This movie is actually trying to be like ""28 Days Later"". Why, because they think that running zombies will make it much scarier. Wrong! Zombies don't run, climb like monkeys in a zoo or give birth to children. Some of the characters are awesome like CJ (Michael Kelly), Andy (Bruce Bohne) and Kenneth (Ving Rhames), my most hated characters are Steve (Ty Burrell) and Nicole (Lindy Booth).My rating for this movie is a 5 out of 10",Dawn of the Dead
282,argentobuff,28 Dawns later.,10,4 January 2006,"Ah another big-budget Hollywood remake.Another Turd to Flush.When they announced a remake to the Classic 79 Dawn.A lot of horror fans were furious.I suspect it was to be a by the numbers job.At least until Boyle's overrated 28 days later scored.Universal with dollars signs in they're eyes called Original producer Richard Rubinstein and had him throw out the walkers.Bringing in the Runners.And faster than you can say...CA-CHING,went into production.I went in with the worst Expectations.But was blown away.The New Dawn is totally outstanding.From its hyper-kinetic beginning, showing of the Apocalypse,to the gloom & doom Johnny Cash Intro,to the hordes of Running,(not walking)Rotting, flesh-hungry Dead.We get the survivors; Nurse, Cop,Dad,Kid,Redneck,Homeosexual,dog etc. Usual Suspects in the bunch.The movie flows very Nice.Its never Boring. Some good action scenes.Some nice bits of black comedy.For the most part.But never engages as well as the gripping first 15 minutes and bogs down.The ending is so-so.And the tacked on post-credits ending smells of studio meddling.Some of the characters act without reason at times.Acting is top-notch.Sarah Polley,Ving Rhames,Jake Webber being the standouts.Familiar faces populate the new Dawn also.And pretty much everyone involved does a great job.It always nice to see Lindy Booth back on the big Screen.The Zombies are very well done here.These are not the stragglers we are used to.The sound and Look totally intimidating.Very scary and lean and mean.I just cannot get past why they had to have them run.It kind of takes away from the movie.First time director Zack Synder hits a home-run with the bases loaded his first time out.The movie looks great.He was the best man for the job.Some Hack would have screwed it up.Michael bay anyone?

But I have to say the remake is just better than the original. I like the 1978 version of 'Dawn of the Dead,' and I was skeptical when I first heard about the remake to the point of being dismissive about it. But the effects were better, the sequences tighter, and the sense that the characters were really fighting for their lives much more immediate. The first ten minutes alone are more intense than anything that happens in the original (I know, I know, but, by comparison, the opening moment of the 1978 film are a disorienting, absurdly gory, muddled mess). I also know that the movie breaks a cardinal rule of the zombie film by allowing the zombies the ability to move quickly, but it really only helps the movie. Frankly, I think it's a lot scarier to have a raving thing come at you at top speed rather than just kind of lumber. I'll agree, the gallows humor and social commentary of the original are missing, but so is the bicycle gang. I mean, really. Come on. What was that about?",Dawn of the Dead

I found the ending rather predictable too and would have preferred less definition - let the viewer decide.I now await the next instalment of the zombie film genre and hope that they put more effort into making the characters come to life (pardon the pun).7 out of 10 but had the potential to score 8 or 9.",Dawn of the Dead

Anyway, we're at such a loss with this movie, really.  Look, in the Dead '78, the humans found the mall--it had everything they could ever want, ever imagine ever having.  Roger, Peter, Steve, Fran became so over-satiated that they wound up becoming dead from within, dead to themselves (even more aparent in the 142 minute version).  Here, like i read somewhere else, the zombies never enter the mall--until the 3rd quarter of the movie and not because of a ""former instinct to be in a place once important to them"" it was simply to get the humans, i still can't remember their names, I think there's Mike, Ana, Luda, Ken, Andy, CJ.  but that's as much as i can remember even after the second viewing--the character's are not as descript. Dead '78 was a film lambasting the excesses of consumerisim and the gluttony it encouraged.  Dead '04 is taking a pro-consumer stance, almost blaspheming the philosophy of its paradigm (Dead '78).  because look, its rated-R, its fast-paced, almost demanding repeated viewings, its in 2:35.1 aspect ratio enabling universal to market at least 4 dvd versions:  a full-screen r-version, a full-screen unrated version, a widescreen r-version, a wide-screen unrated version, not taking into consideration a ""renegade director's cut"" possiblility.

The plot is naturally bad, but it's unlikely that a zombie flick will ever produce a decent drama or room for character development. There are fixed standard characters, like a cop, a black guy with a gun, redneck security guard and so on. Most of them die in quite entertaining way, so the audience is never bored. Casting is good, however, it doesn't really matter, since most characters are quite flat.

290,droopfozz,If you liked the original at all-stay away from this one,3,10 June 2005,"One sure sign that your remake of a cult-classic and near campy 1970's horror film is bad, is that you make the film you're trying to improve upon look more like a masterpiece, and your film like unintentional spoofing. That is the case with this film, that starts out wanting to be taken seriously, and lost me quickly with a strange choice of music with The Man Comes Around by Johnny Cash during a title montage of apocalyptic footage borrowed from your local Fox affiliate.This film really only has the same idea as the original, everything else is newer. This time there are more people who stay alive (and die) in a shopping mall (though much of the film is outside, taking away the claustrophobic fear of the original) while zombies, that are fast and with a virus (ala 28 Days later) eat people (not the mysterious reason in the Dead series). For those who always thought fast zombies were scarier this movie proves otherwise. Seeing a zombie run is actually funnier than scary. Perhaps that worked in 28 Days Later because it was mostly in the dark, but in daylight it doesn't work. And this film misses all of the important points of the original classic.Gone is the hellishly creepy and dirge like atmosphere, and the social commentary on decadence and racial issues. Another aspect this film loses with fast zombies is that they are now killing machines, not almost sympathetic near humans that aren't all too different from us. The dialogue is just dumb, and the plot is as well. The only part I did like was the addition of a gun-store owner who is trapped on a near by roof, but they manage to mess that plot line off also. Gone also is the character development, bumped up from 4 people to about 20 or so, most of whom we never get to meet before they get eaten.Unlike the original this film stays away from philosophy, and is much shorter, about half as long, as Romero's version. The action is almost boring, it's not scary, and in many ways this film is more vulgar than the original in handling death scenes. The violence and gore was extreme and unnecessary in the first, but here it's just profane. You'll see what I mean. I doubt that you can say Romero's direction was sympathetic, but it was more thoughtful than in this one. And a happy ending? Come on, it's a zombie movie! Quick List: Best Zombie Movies",Dawn of the Dead
291,pachl,This movie proves the cinema experience dwarfs that of TV!,10,4 October 2007,"If you're reading this review, you probably already know the general plot: an unexplained plague has created incredibly fast, strong, rabidly hungry flesh-eating zombies. The few human survivors take refuge in a shopping mall.Rather that describe the movie, let me tell you how it affected me, because the true test of cinema is if it made an emotional impact on you. Keep in mind that movie makers have an almost impossible task. Nowadays, we're all jaded movie goers. Seeing realistic dinosaurs, or spaceships hurtling through space often elicit yawns, not wide-eyed amazement.I saw Dawn of the Dead at a 10:30pm show on a Sunday night. When I left the theatre, it was pitch black, and my heart was pounding in my chest. Even though I am a very rational person, I couldn't overcome an overwhelming sense of fear. Just like a little kid who sees his first monster movie, I was scared and deeply affected.When I opened my car, I made sure that no one was hiding in the back seat (yes, that is ridiculous, but is shows what an astoundingly strong impression the movie had on me). I drove home in complete silence. I kept the radio off, and I drove through the blackness and the empty streets common after midnight on a Sunday in suburbia.I drove quietly down the same street I had been 10,000 times before, but very oddly, there was a police car sitting next to a cul-de-sac. In 30 years of driving, I had never seen a police car there. The lights were off, so I couldn't discern anything in the blackness. The first thought that went through my head was whether the policman inside was still alive, or already a zombie. Perhaps his partner was already feasting on his corpse. (What am I thinking??!! This is ridiculous. Get that movie out of your head. Pay attention to the road and just get home.)When I arrived home, it actually occurred to me that if I used the garage door opener, I would alert any zombies in the area that living people are in the house (mental note to self: stop! This is ridiculous. It's just a movie. It's just a movie. It's just a movie.) When I closed the door behind me, I made sure no one slipped in at the last moment. I walked carefully to the dark, unlit landing and........ pow!!!! A light bulb met a noisy, flashbulb type death as it burnt out. That scared the hell out of me, as if my heart weren't racing enough.As I walked through the kitchen, it occurred to me how vulnerable the house would be to a zombie attack. Too many windows. (another mental note: stop! Pull yourself together. It's just a movie) I closed my bedroom door, and did something I had never done in all the years I lived there: I locked it.If a movie can have this kind of effect on a normally unflappable adult, there is no question the movie accomplished what it set out to do: it scared the hell out of the audience.Note: Dawn of the Dead must be seen in a theatre to get the full experience. On TV, it's like watering down a beer. On TV, (even a nice big 50"" plasma, all the doomsday visuals that previously astounded me seemed not only less impressive just whizzed right past me. In particular, the scene where they have retro-fitted a bus to make an escape. In the theatre, that scene looked like something out of Armageddon. It was awe-inspiring and awesome, rolled into one. On TV, the scene appeared to just race by me.",Dawn of the Dead

Good action scenes they were too, well paced, well acted and the tension was well developed by the direction. The zombies were scarier than in the original, they looked scarier and posed a bigger threat than the zombies in the original movie, which were slow moving and easier to escape from.

294,NateF88,"Terrific, Surprising, and truely horrifying.",10,22 March 2004,"Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a terrific, surprising, and truly horrifying horror film. It digs deep down into our minds to find true fear in all of us, and sparks a nerve in our head to go along with it. It's a terrific film because:
  1) The zombies can run and jump and are therefore ten times scarier than the ones in the original. It's better and scarier this way.  2) The outbreak and scary stuff happen right in the beginning of the movie and therefore is an edge of your seat thrill ride all the way through.  3) You actually care for the characters, well, the humans at least.   4) The sets, make up effects, and gore effects are outstanding.  I can go on forever listing why this film rules, but this review would take 3 days to read. What I can write is, this film is just as good (if not better) than the original, and is a new horror classic. Props to director Zack Snyder for giving us such a treat to sit through. I loved it! To all horror fans, GO SEE DAWN OF THE DEAD!",Dawn of the Dead
295,go2dean,Excellent Updated Illustration,10,25 July 2004,"I don't think you could've asked for a better remake. This version had a lot more than just ""the dead are coming to get you"". In fact, in this film the dead are literally chasing you with a vengeance. This remake gave you everything that the original was lacking; 1)It gave you more action with zombies more mobile & possessing more strength. If you were to encounter 5 of these creatures your only hope of escape would be the use of a rocket launcher or the ability to fly. 2)You had less gore in terms internal body parts being exposed. Even the cannibalism was curbed. 3)You had a more extensive & more interesting crew of characters, even the bit part of Kenneth's roof partner was nicely done. 4)You had a more plausible and even frightening premise on which the ""Deadish"" came to being. The possibility of such a disease agent overtaking our society does exist with the deteriorating conditions of our environment. 5)You definitely have all the components for a sequel with how it ended. The performances of the entire cast were great, and the chemistry was there as well. This was more a Sci-Fi speculative film rather then a horror movie. 10 out 10",Dawn of the Dead
296,E-Z-Rider,*Much* better than the original,8,29 March 2004,"For all the hype it gets from its small but devoted cadre of fans, the original Dawn of the Dead is really, really cheesy.  A mall with a gun shop and tons of ammo in it?  A few zombies that move slow as molasses in winter? A helicopter that can take them outta there whenever it gets too dangerous? Where's the terror in that?  Most of the movie is spent playing around in the shopping mall.Not so with the current version.  The zombies here are mean and *fast*--and there are zillions of them.  The terror and despair are real--as is the drama.  Everything is precisely calculated and has its reason.  Characters change as they live under the strain of balancing compassion with survival. Unlike the cardboard cutouts in the earlier version, these are real people confronted with an unimaginable horror.  Some respond better than others, but both the action and the character development make sense and ring true. Even the music is far superior to the original.  This is a masterpiece that has borrowed little more than the title from the original--and a good thing too.",Dawn of the Dead
297,Reef-Shark,"Okay, but was it needed?",6,21 August 2010,"George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is a classic horror movie that really didn't need to be retold...but that's exactly what director Zack Snyder has done so I guess I should review it after having seen it twice. I admit there have been far worse remakes, but I can't help but sense how unnecessary this was especially since these two films are worlds apart in many ways. They don't really remake Dawn of the Dead so much as they re-use some elements from the original script and slap the title ""Dawn of the Dead"" on it to get attention.In the original film George A. Romero had used the setting of a mall to make satire of human nature. In the Snyder film everything has been refit for zombie action. George A. Romero used the stumbling zombies from his 'Night of the Living Dead'. Zach Snyder uses the Olympic Sprinter Zombies from '28 Days Later'. Romero knew how to spread his movie out with a casual pace. Snyder in the vain of all modern action movies uses quick cuts and generally seems to have everything moving as fast as it can giving no time for character development other that easily recognizable stereotypes.I think its clear that I prefer the original...But I don't think this is remake is bad. Its just another zombie movie is all. Nothing really special, nothing really bad about it. It doesn't stand up to films like those of George A. Romero or 28 Days Later, but it is better than things like Resident Evil.So, this new Dawn of the Dead is quite a bit of gore-filled fun, but as a whole is flat and uninteresting compared to the 1978 original.",Dawn of the Dead
298,klesker,Surprising!,7,28 March 2004,"Im not a massive fan of remakes (The Blob and Psycho anyone?). I avoided The Texas Chainsaw Masacre like the plague because the original is one of my favourite horror movies and dont even get me started on The Italian Job. Dont ask me why i went to see this one. The original Dawn of The Dead, even though it was overly long, was still a damn good film! I guess i was curious and i had heard good things about it (unlike Chainsaw).After watching it i can conclude that other than the fact that it's set in a shopping mall this is a very different beast to the original. There's more characters, more action and the Zombies are a hellovalot more scary! This is a cross between the original and 28 Days Later (which was also a damn good film). The fact that the Zombies can now run makes it more believable that they can take over the planet. They're just so relentless.The opening ten minutes of this film are possibly the most disturbing i have ever seen. i cant explain why just see the movie and find out.
Like the original though this movie starts to drag in the middle. Although there are the odd moments that are disturbing or disgusting (or both, the Zombie baby is not a pleasent experience) that keep your attention until the final act, which ditches the horror aspect for all out action.This is where the movies major flaw lies as the end half hour is a mission to make you feel sick and its not because of the gore. Every shot is handheld and after the first five minutes you'll be craving for a break or attempting to keep you pop-corn in. It is very dissorientating and is only for people that dont suffer from motion sickness.The end of this movie does leave it open for a Day of The Dead remake to follow but how it will be done i dont know. As with every remake these days this is the very definition of the term ""re-imagining"" and if you're expecting the original walk away coz this is a totally different film and a damn good one at that.4/5",Dawn of the Dead
299,TonysLittleFriend,"Cancell the Academy Awards, we have a winner!",7,3 September 2004,"The action settles in an abandoned shopping mall, where Anna, a police officer named Kenneth and a few other survivors - gun-toting Andre, his pregnant girlfriend Luda and mysterious Mike. In the mall they are confronted by the local security, who suddenly have delusions of power. The group winds up locked in a home furnishings store before turning tables on the rent-a-cops. Setting up shop in the mall, they have a little fun, playing basketball and working out with gear from the sports store.Most comical is Ken forming a bond with a gun store owner across the street named Andy, with the two communicating by writing on erasable message boards. They play chess and take pot shots at the horde of zombies below them for laughs. In a true sign of a sick mind at work, there's a montage of mayhem done to a lounge band covering The Disturbed's ""The Sickness."" Snyder is crazy, and I love it.The strongest character studies in the film show how people react under pressure as society collapses. We see it in the rent-a-cops trying to display power they don't really have, and in the development of Michael, who shows strength of character despite a less-than-impressive background. Like many, I found myself anxious about the news that Dawn was being remade. I wasn't particularly worried about the choice of director or screenwriter (like some outspoken folks). I was more concerned with the ""uber-stupid-teenification"" that seems to haunt most of the decent ideas that surface in cinema nowadays - particularly in horror films.That said, there were a couple instances in the new Dawn that I could've lived without. But they were easily forgotten amidst the ruthless spectacle of these very determined survivors in a shopping mall.Romero fans and newcomers alike should be pleased. The violence is huge, And the gore, sweesh, it was very gory at times. It was simply very well done.And for all of you people who are upset over the running zombies, just get over it already. I'm a big fan of the original. ""But the bottom line is this: lumbering, staggering, slow-moving zombies just aren't scary anymore folks. They scare your grandma, but not us anymore. It's been almost 30 years. We have to be ... ""re-shocked"" into believing in the bleak, almost unbearable truth that anyone alive during the Dawn of the Dead apocalypse...is in deep doodoo.""***/*****",Dawn of the Dead
300,MadWatch,Zombie-tastic fun,8,22 March 2004,"Summary: Dead humans are returning in the form of zombies that attack and kill living people. A group of survivors hole up in a shopping mall while deciding how best to survive. Simple story, simple fun.The movies overall plot is very simplistic, but the individual events and subplots that make up the movie are very well written and well done. Almost all of the characters are written and acted like real people that one can associate with. The special effects range from needfully simple to well done on a large scale.The fact that there is virtually no background to *how* the zombies came to be actually adds to the movie. It adds the element of the unknown and reduces nitpicks on *how* the zombies should be acting/behaving (unlike Resident Evil that explained almost precisely *how* the zombies came to be, opening a whole can of nitpicks).Rating: Good story events, good characters, good effects, good time by all. I give this movie a 8.5 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
301,adudewhoiscool,A true zombie flick,8,23 December 2006,"The 2004 ""re-imagining"" of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is an impressive zombie movie. There will be zero comparing to the original George A. Romero movie because this reviewer had only see bits and pieces (lame pun) of that one. There will be no comparisons between the unrated edition and the theatrical cut because this reviewer never saw the theatrical version. If you decide to watch this version of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" expect lots of gore, and action, mixed in with plenty of suspense. If you expect those, you should be very pleased.A young female nurse, named Anna, is caught in the middle of a worldwide chaos as flesh-eating zombies begin taking over the world by attacking the living. She escapes into the streets and is rescued by a police officer named Kenneth. Together they find shelter in a mall, along with a group of other survivors. For a while everything is OK, but then they start running out of food, the power goes out, and the dead keep finding ways to break through their defenses. Realizing this, they must make a plan for escape. Will they find a way to survive or is the human race doomed? The first 15 minutes of this movie was one of the best introductions this reviewer had seen, not only for a horror movie but also for any type. The idea of putting a Johnny Cash song, ""The Man Comes Around,"" in the opening credits, may seem strange in a horror movie, but because of the songs post-apocalyptic feel, it fits well. It was a bold move, but it worked well. After watching the movie, you discover that putting that the addition of that Johnny Cash song was pure genius.From beginning to end, this movie grabs you by the throat and never lets you go. It starts with a creepy introduction and continues that pace throughout. This is a zombie movie, so you should expect gore and plenty of it. While this movie is advertised as a pure horror movie, it should be considered more of an action movie with elements of suspense and horror. Another great factor was that they never took this movie too seriously by adding some dark comedy to it. You also need to watch the end credits to see what happens to the remaining survivors.Throughout this movie, the main stars are the zombies. These zombies are different then the normal zombies seen in video games, movies, books, and television shows. These zombies are more realistic looking, which made them scarier. The make up was amazing and a huge improvement over the zombies in the original ""Dawn of the Dead."" Zombies could not get very much more realistic then what is shown in the 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead."" Another difference is the speed of the zombies. These zombies can run and will be able to catch you if you do not run fast enough. That made it scarier simply because you do not think the human race has a chance of survival.The actors do a decent job in making you care for their survival, even though majority of the movie was focused on the action and suspense. None of the actors did an award winning performance, but it did their jobs. Sarah Polley played Anna, the main woman who was given the most time and development. Ving Rhames plays Kenneth, a cop fighting for his survival. Mekhi Phifer plays Andre, a man having a tough time realizing that his wife, Luda (played by Inna Korobkina), may be turning into a zombie. Jake Webber plays Michael, a person you do not like at first but by the end you end up liking him.The only real defect to this version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the writing. This is not very surprising since this is not only an action/horror movie, but also a zombie movie. There were plot holes and some things were not explained well. Some of the characters could have been expanded a little bit. Some people may complain about that, but this reviewer did not seem to mind it at all. After all, the unrated cut is 110 minutes long, which is almost two hours; no zombie movie needs to be over two hours long.Overall, this is an entertaining movie. With a $28 million budget, you should expect lots of blood and gore, realistic zombie make up, explosions with great action scenes involving: guns, saws, and other weapons. The results make this an entertaining popcorn movie you can turn your brain off to. With action, horror, and some comedy mixed in, there was everything you should expect in a zombie movie. The 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is very recommend!",Dawn of the Dead
302,beardedmovieguy,"Running Zombies, Oh Crap!",7,15 March 2015,"I have been watching a lot of Zombie stuff lately, so that I will be prepared for the coming Zombie Apocalypse, so I finally got around to seeing Zack Snyders version of the George Romero's classic, and I have to say, good job Zack. It is not a perfect movie and some of the things don't make much sense to me, like if the guy with the sniper rifle was sitting on a gun shop with lots of ammo, why was he not killing more zombies, heck, he could have taken out pretty much everyone that was there and they could have took a nice gingerly drive to the marina, but overall it is a pretty good depiction of what would happen if there was a zombie outbreak, and I am now that much more prepared for what is coming around the bend, so that makes it worth seeing all by itself, although it could have done without the nudity. 3.5 Beards Out Of 5",Dawn of the Dead

There were many aspects of the movie I could go into but I'm not sure where to start, there were a few scenes that could have been a little better but in terms of quality this is a great zombie action/thriller type movie. one the channel I saw it on (watched on a movie channel) also blanked out the cuss words which I don't see why is necessary given the assumption your watching an R rated movie anyway.",Dawn of the Dead
305,HuskyEnzo,"""High-velocity-zombie at close range can damage the mind""",10,22 October 2008,"I can't recall whether there was any zombie-movie before this one, that accelerated the guys as seen here but it surely revived an ... well, at least ""undead genre"". To me it was a new impulse, a new element to present zombies rather like rabid-raging fast animals, than slow-mo man-eaters who mainly get dangerous in numbers; now even a single one can kill. That's new and cool. There's basically not much to say about zombie-flicks, everybody knows the deal. The only question is: ""Was it good or bad?"" or to express it properly: ""Have you been thrilled and entertained clever but without brains?"" The answer here is simple and not negotiable: ""Yes!"" If after only 10 minutes the whole neighborhood is burning down, the world tumbles into devastation and they are playing Johnny Cash, then... yes well, then I'm supposed to love the movie.When I dragged my buddies into the theater (I had already seen it 2 days before), some asked me: ""Man, are you certain? I don't know."" I paused, smiled and just replied: ""Trust me."" In recent years I've come away of saying that, because it can end in a nosedive for the expertise-rep among one's friends. Here I was absolutely sure. It was the attacking girl which suddenly emptied all their popcorn-buckets after 6 minutes; theater-staff must have hated this film. After the end-credits they were all strung-out but happy; me too even by the second time. Another good point here were a bunch of fine and not too known actors and also a script which allows the characters to avoid the typical horror-movie-mistakes we gotten annoyed of through the years: ""Aw, Sally is gone. Let's all take flashlights, spread out in the woods and search her."" Yeah. Right. Die you idiots. And take the authors with you. Or when finally an armory is found, this idiotic pattern to take a shotgun, bash the ammo-box on the table so all shells spread away, grab three shells into the pocket (instead of directly loading) and go, as seen for an instance in ""Jurassic Park"".These guys are smarter, their ideas are good (see escape-plan), once in a gun-shop they're truly gearing up, and parts of the group finally only fail by a tragic accident (anyway: secure your working-space! I told you once, I told you twice...). The end leaves the survivors fate open; good for a sequel but not necessarily.I'm pleased to see that the DVD is available since 2006 uncut for 8,- Euros (approx. 5$). Nevertheless I'd even say that ""DOTD"" is one of the few zombie-flicks which is recommendable to be seen on the big screen.

306,mcrpghk,"""Get up, come on get down with the sickness!""",8,30 March 2021,"In 1978 George Romero presented us with the second film of the trilogy of the dead ""Dawn of the Dead"", as I was born in the 2000s I did not have the opportunity to follow at the time, but while watching in the present day I can not like it, yes I understand all its importance and criticism behind the cannibals stuck in the mall without any other way , but in my opinion he has aged poorly, both in practical effects, makeup and acting, but thanks to zack snyder's version I can appreciate the whole concept of the work!Of course, to this day we have the discussion about ordinary zombies vs fast zombies, and although many people believe that Zack was responsible for this concept, but it has existed since 1985 when ""The Return of the Living Dead"" came to us, so I prefer to say that what was established with this Remake was the frenzy of these monsters , which combines with the times when we lived in 2004, in fact combines much more in the present day, where it seems that nothing in our society has as virtue or principle patience, everything must be instant an instant or immediately, people act as animals or even as lifeless machines, regardless of the most basic things of life as ""human being"" above all.I think the only thing missing in the film that ends up getting inferior to the original are scenes showing the comodism and materialism of human characters when being trapped in that mall, if we analyze well there is not so many reasons to splother or panic the characters to be trapped in that place.The savagery that the human being can have with his fellowmen only by selfishness or resentment is also not exploited in the way he deserved, it is already consensus that in most apocalyptic works the greatest threat to a human being is himself, here this message ends up being resolved very quickly and forgotten during the course of the film, the idea that our society is sick becomes clearer in the music of the band Disturbed in the final credits than in the whole movie.I think in the end the proposal of the work is to put us in a state of total caution since only one mistake can cost his life and the well-being of his entire group, despite some attitudes without logic that some characters have the balance is positive and the film does well overall.",Dawn of the Dead

308,nethlyn,"Zombies are once again your metaphor for whatever, and in this case, it's more like Aliens than Romero's original - in a good way.",9,9 September 2005,"*****SLIGHT SPOILERS***** Watched both the cinema cut and now have the Director's version on DVD, this film probably has 1000 comments after 18 months but having watched it three times since buying the DVD one thing struck me...for all its homages to the original Dawn of the Dead with the cameos etc, this movie actually owes much more to Aliens (1986) in its speed, execution, and the fact there's a bigger group of people, not to mention of course the running Zombies of 28 Days Later (2003), itself a heavy ""borrowing"" of Day of The Dead (1985), but whose $45million US gross allowed this remake to exist.It's not a question of thinking the original or the remake is the superior version...Romero's Dawn of the Dead 1978 is the ""Alien"" of the two films, slower, more intelligent, more thought-provoking and with an attempt to actually show you a six-month stretch locked in a shopping mall with a 40-minute second act which modern filmmakers just don't do anymore. Snyder's Dawn of The Dead 2004 is Aliens, (or Platoon in a shopping mall) an action film with Zombies in it but the Zombies are a metaphor for whatever you want and not what Romero told you as with the 70s film.The ""rules"" have been set up, but in comes a director who focuses on action and gives a bigger group of people better aim and the hope of a better chance (though that also means a larger group of people to bite the dust). In spite of the mall scenes dominating the second Act as with the original, you get a greater sense of scale with the new film although no mention of the internet except in one of the DVD Extras. One of the rules of the original is also dropped. I prefer the Dawn of the Dead novel to the older film, which only takes me 2 hours to read.As for the director's cut...some scenes I plain couldn't remember but on having them pointed out, I was glad they were gone when I watched the film in the cinema - I don't care how they got into the mall, the film language did that for me with just two good shots cut together, rather than the ""where's the door"" nonsense. Likewise with the ""littlest Zombie"" scene (fans know which one I'm talking about) - again, in the cinema, we saw as much as we needed to know and the faster cutaway was a lot better to end it.***SPOILER***I don't know if it's classed as a blooper when one character at a crucial moment, cannot open a door but then when it's time for him to check out, the zombies have absolutely no trouble - that's the one fault I could find with the film and I have had to watch it four times to find that, so I will put that down to nitpicking. Besides, Universal have my money now! The ending? Speculative and the whole (surviving) cast were signed to the sequel, as their careers don't seem to have been damaged in the same way as the 1970s cast, there wouldn't be anything wrong with the sequel to this remake coming around again - even if ***SPOILER AGAIN*** the end had shades of Deep Rising to it, mixed with The Blair Witch Project in the use of DV. It's clever that you're seeing a different side of a character just through clips - or maybe just reconfirming his reputation. One of the DVD Extras continues the use of the DV Camera technique and it works extremely well.As a means of passing time while waiting for Land of The Dead which doesn't hit UK screens until the 23rd September, the Dawn Of The Dead remake is a great action movie with zombies in it, and made by a fan for open-minded fans of Romero's films and a new generation which doesn't put Romero's trilogy on a pedestal and wants a faster film. You could watch either version according to your mood. It's certainly not the disaster some of the posters here have made out to be, the only problem is, can you rent the cinema cut where you are? I've only found the director's one in the shops. Wait for the second UK edition and you'll probably be able to buy both.",Dawn of the Dead
309,Evil_Magus,One of the Better Remakes I've Seen.,5,1 July 2006,"This movie is easily one of the better remakes I've seen. I've watched it several times, and every time I like it all the more. However, this movie is an example where my personal preference for a movie outshines the movie's actual artistic merit. Despite being an excellent remake, and highly entertaining, it's only a decent film. Being such, my ranking reflects that, and not my personal enjoyment of the film.All the actors that they chose did a decent job on this movie. There were no extraordinary performances, or even great ones; only non-obtrusive good ones. Each part was well cast and it can be said that nobody fell short in this regard.The opening credit sequence, after Sarah Polley (Who played Anna) fled her home, was alright, except for the choice in music. While the lyrics might have been somewhat fitting, the overall tone it set was entirely counter-productive for what they've already established and what they continue to establish afterwords. Even the clips that they choose to show for that sequence are mediocre at best. But it still gets it's point across extremely well: This is not an isolated instance, but an epidemic (of a sort) sweeping the world at large.One part of the movie that I found extremely annoying at first, but which eventually turns into something of an acquired taste, is the coloring and lighting. They're all unnaturally bright. Upon first viewing, this can be detracting. Even on second viewing it can be very annoying. But after that, you get used to it and can tolerate it. It actually is somewhat unnerving, which compliments the movie, to see everything in a matter that's far to bright and colorful for the pervading mood and situation all around them. The makeup for the zombies was done extremely well, I felt, and far surpassed the original.If the original 1978 Dawn of the Dead was something of a Horror/Drama movie, then the remake is more of a Horror/Action one. It still touches upon human drama amidst the swarms of flesh-eating zombies, but that takes second stage to all of the physical activity. Especially at the end, this movie digresses into an almost all-out action movie, although swings back somewhat at the end more to horror.This is not a slavishly devoted remake. Except for the concept of people hiding out in a shopping mall amidst a zombie attack, and a few other details (A black man being a cop who's brother died, a pregnant woman, a woman who lost her husband, etc...) there's very little in common with it and its predecessor. The vast majority of the action and actions taken throughout the course of the film are different from the the original. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The movie has a life and an action all of its own, and can be considered on its own merit, and not just that of the 1978 film. It is rare that remake can do this, and it should always be commended.One criticism that I have for the film is the over-abundance of characters. The original only had four protagonists. This one has around 12 or 13 throughout the whole film, although some only have a brief time on screen. This makes each life, subsequently, less valuable. Granted, they are able to pull off a large-bodied cast better than most other films, and are able to keep the audience from perpetually waiting for them all to die off.One thing that I like, which seems to be a trend in many zombie movies as of late, is for these, as one person called them, ""Super Zombies"". By this, I mean zombies that are not slowly lumbering sacks of meat, but fast, strong and deadly undead; such as in the movie 28 Days later or the book Cell. They add incalculably to the danger perpetuated by the zombies, and makes the threat all that more... well... threatening.Overall, this is an extremely entertaining film, and one of the best remakes I've ever seen. It might not be, from a more critical standpoint, a good film, however. It's not nearly so good as the original overall, lacking the sharp satirical wit of it's 1978 predecessor, although it does a far better job in making the zombies a threat than before. This is a definite must-see for horror, Zombie and Romero fans. It should also appeal to a much younger audience than the original.",Dawn of the Dead
310,worthythorn24,One of the best action/horror films in recent memory,8,16 November 2004,"When I first learned that they were doing a remake of George A. Romero's classic film ""Dawn of the Dead"", I admit I was more than a little skeptical. To many horror aficionados (myself included), DOTD is the holy grail of horror films. I can't help but think of some of the other remakes (or re-imaginings, rather) that fell flat on their face in my opinion, such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Shining (TV). For fear that they would turn the greatest zombie movie of all time into a cross between Dawson's Creek and Valentine, I shied away from watching it until it came out to video. To be honest, the film blew me away.It begins with a nurse named Ana returning home from work late one evening and she goes to sleep with her husband, which illustrates the stereotypical marriage and suburban lifestyle we have all come to enjoy. The next morning, however their perfect little world gets turned upside down when a little girl who just so happens to be missing half her upper lip viciously attacks her husband. As we all know from zombie flicks of the past, once bitten you become one of the undead as well. The husband soon turns into a zombie and attacks his wife. She flees and finds the entire city in chaos. Shortly thereafter she encounters Kenneth (Ving Rhames) who seems to be the only authority figure left alive. Together they end up in a mall to fend for themselves while awaiting on impending help. There they encounter several other individuals who are just as shocked by what's going on as they are. Little do they know that there is no help on the way.The plot of the film is pretty rudimentary; living vs. non-living and survival of the fittest. The characters manage to bond inside the mall and entertain themselves with all the goodies that the mall has to offer. In this film there is no underlying social commentary as in its predecessor, but it still has its moments. Of course, a film like this doesn't have much character development and each player is basically a cliché' in themselves, but who watched flicks like this for that anyhow? One big question on everybody's mind: Is the film scary? In my opinion, yes. There are some very tense moments and the movie is filled with blood and gore. Not quite as harrowing a watch as the original, but with the MPAA there are certain things you just can't do anymore and expect a theatrical release. I won't give away the ending, but it was just a little lame I thought. But that's just me :)I'll give this movie an 8/10. Excellent horror/action movie. A definite watch if you're a fan of this genre, but not a good decision if you're looking for a movie to romance anybody with :P.",Dawn of the Dead

312,cny_cd,Very disappointing remake of a classic,3,25 April 2006,"I watched this film for the first time recently, and I have to say, I was very disappointed. This film was clearly made for the ""20-something"" MTV crowd who is more into films with instant gratification than anything that might require some thought. The fast zombies made it seem even more unbelievable and silly (why would dying make a 400 pound woman all of a sudden be able to run faster than Carl Lewis in his prime?), and the characters were incredibly one-dimensional and quite frankly, boring. The plot line is so silly that a 3rd grader could have done better. To have the ending shown during the final credits was completely ridiculous. The film started off with some promise, and could have had a satisfying ending, but for some reason, the producers chose to obliterate the entire cast and leave nothing at all to the imagination. A waste of time. 3 stars out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
313,georgewhittingham1,Doesn't hold up in 2021,5,13 October 2021,"I remember watching this when I was kid, absolutely overwhelmed with how scary and enjoyable it was. However, having watched it again in 2021. The acting is painful, some of the action scenes are poor, but overall it just feels like a B grade movie. Don't get me wrong, they're some enjoyable scenes, but this is definitely one to watch after a few drinks and to not pay much attention too.",Dawn of the Dead
314,BruddanChrist,A great debut from Snyder!,7,8 March 2008,"DotD is not nearly as scary as it is haunting. It masterfully paints a small world from the start, so it shrinks at an alarming rate once the excrement hits the oscillator. The zombies become an overwhelming antagonist, closing in on the survivors fast enough to make you realize they simply postponed their deaths.The acting is what you would expect. Nothing horrendous, but nothing great. There are some lines here and there that will make you roll your eyes, but nothing that makes you grind your teeth. I like the absence of recognizable actors (with the exception of Ving Rhames and Mehki Phifer, of course) because it adds to the illusion that this kind of nightmare could come true.My one real gripe with the film is that it is unabashedly violent. It takes any and every opportunity to splatter some gore, and it gets tiresome toward the end. I'm not complaining that it desensitizes the audience (even though it does), just that it looses its coolness after a while.Dawn of the Dead isn't perfect. It suffers from a lot of nasty Hollywoodisms and abuses just about every horror movie tactic in the book. Spooky sound effects, inhuman screeches, close-ups of bullet casings hitting the floor... (And, of course, everybody become expert marksmen when it comes to head shots.) Still, it succeeds in what it sets out to do: scare the hell out of the audience.",Dawn of the Dead
315,leorican,The Dawn is here...And Zack Snyder has brought it!!!!!!,10,24 June 2005,"One of the best remakes in memory. Zack Snyder's directorial debut is a fast, high tension, full speed ahead action Zombie Flick that holds no apologies. He has made this film, originally done by George Romero, his own. I remember sitting in the theater not knowing what to expect but from the minute I saw the first frames I knew I was in for a ride. Slick and perfect, zooming in from an X-Ray of a skull, the story opens and builds up creepily as the character of Anna, ( played by the perfectly cast Sarah Polley)who is a nurse, is getting off her shift at the hospital. We are given clues that something is not right with the world today and the scenes that occur as Anna leaves the hospital and then arrives home are foreshadows of what's to come and gave me the chills. The following scenes depicting Anna and her boyfriend's next day ""morning visitor"" is one of the most eerie and frightening moments in the eye popping opening as all hell is about to break loose. After watching the opening credits and music, which set the mood for the rest of the film, I know I was going to have a blast. What follows is a survival test for a group of people who now find themselves thrown together in a shopping mall as they fight off the crazed zombies outside and try and figure out how to stay alive. This is in my opinion, way better than the original although that was a classic in its day. Snyder has raised the bar for Zombie flicks that all directors of this genre should adhere to. These fast moving undead are far more scarier than slow moving stiffs we usually see in this types of films. Great adaption of the original script and scenery you can chew on like the undead eating up some fresh meat. The ending credit scenes....make sure you stay in your seat till the lights come on.....are an added devilish treat...Did I say I love this movie? Filmmakers take note....This is how a remake is done!",Dawn of the Dead
316,Yourmothersbox,One of the rare...,9,25 June 2021,Remakes that are just as good as the originals. You could tell the filmmakers had a love and passion for the original film. But instead of doing a direct shot by shot remake they took those elements and took a more modern spin on them and it worked fantastic. I haven't had this much fun watching a zombie movie and a very long time. Shows like The Walking Dead owe a lot to this remake because up until then although zombies were scary they were never really taken too seriously. For me this is one of the first zombie movies that made the zombies extremely terrifying. Great film!,Dawn of the Dead
317,marialiiva,10/10,10,28 March 2020,One of my all time favorite zombie movies! Not a single scene where youll be bored,Dawn of the Dead
318,deric-15124,One of the Best! CLASSIC,10,6 June 2021,This is absolutely one of the best zombie flicks that's ever been made. Truly terrifying how fast the zombies are in this movie. I've always been used to the zombies walking around super slow but this version changed my whole perspective. In previous movies and shows you could just walk away from a slow zombie but not in this one.,Dawn of the Dead
319,Samualt,Excellent Horror Movie,10,29 March 2004,"If you like horror films then this is for you. Sarah Polley does some fine acting as Ana even though the script doesn't develop her character as much as it should. I think we will see her in many movies to come. The rest of the cast did just as well, and the director, Zack Snyder, shows he knows what he is doing by giving some truely awesome visuals not usually seen in a horror film. If your expecting a low-budget gore fest you couldn't be more wrong. It is a large-budget gore fest with lots of twists and turns. It does lag in one or two small places but that is offset by the chilling scenes that come next. It is a very different movie than the original so you may want to see both if you can. This one is better than the low-budget original if for no other reason than the fantastic special effects and acting. If you like Resident Evil, Evil Dead, or Night of the Living Dead then your going to love this! I give it 10/10.",Dawn of the Dead
320,Hellsinger,Alright but not what I thought it would be,1,7 April 2004,"I've seen the original so don't accuse me of missed things. I gave the 2004 edition a 4 out of 10. Half marks lost because of the huge plot variation and another point out due to the stupidity that was born out of those changes.A REAL shame this is. They just had to change the plot so much, and made the movie much worse than the original. Especially what's with the ending?? And with the useless old people?? Seriously... Some scenes were nice like the Jay Leno joke and other characters, and the bhutane? box explosion. But the rest will simply not do. I prefer the original by far...Oh yeah, and this movie is NOT scary at all, jesus christ people, I can't believe that movie actually is scary to people today. Haven't you watched TV in a while, 28 Days later, Resident Evil, you get used to the so-called jumps... Hellsinger out...",Dawn of the Dead
321,ezoelmansouri-58306,A Perfect Zombie Film!,9,24 February 2021,"In a world of bad remakes Dawn of the Dead '2004' was an awesome remake with new directions and an end that deserve a sequel.I really loved that they didn't follow the exact storyline, they took the basics from the original and made it more contemporary, The cast were amazing and I really loved the team spirit that presented in this film.the events were breathtaking, the chase and the action were very fun for watch, I was literally on the edge of my seat through many scenes and I start to really care about the characters, definitely one of the greatest zombie films.",Dawn of the Dead
322,Abominog,Zombies would have enjoyed this one,8,5 October 2004,"Possible spoilers alert!It looks like the army of ardent fans of the critically acclaimed zombie sensation from the first-time director Zack Snyder has been propagating to proportions commensurable with the scale of plague that evoked legions of the undead in the movie.At least the voting history statistics for the 2004 version is nearly to catch up with the one for the George Romero's classic in the course of 6 years since 1998 (i.e. from the time the first comment on 1978 movie has been posted).If I may consider myself a devoted fan of the horror genre, I can't say I'm a zombie film buff, considering sensitive nature of life and death issue, which is normally provided with a kind of cynical treatment in such movies. However judgment on moral aspects should be tossed away, once we can afford watching that sort of stuff.Unlike Savini's earlier (good but per se frame-by-frame) remake of the Night of the Living Dead, this one in comparison with the original definitely has agenda and style of its own.Except for the shopping mall as the main set of the film the new Dawn is totally different (neither better nor worse): more characters (both dead and alive), wilder action, more realistic and graphic violence (even disabled stunts were employed in the movie), more gory mayhem, more sinister black humor (I wonder if Reynolds admits the alleged distant likeness to the handsome mustached folk in the crowd?).Of course striking visual style and great fx are its primary merits. But I can hardly uphold the opinions accusing the creators in lack of characterization and personality development.Of course the emotional experience of the leads that found themselves in a situation like that, loss of relatives and dramatic change in usual way of life are concealed behind the opaque veil but it is reasonable compromise for the sake of frantic momentum.Sarah Polley (together with her stunt doubles) has demonstrated more than decent performance.Terse and tough as a cliff Rhames is always fun to watch.Kelly' CJ was simply awesome, while Burrell as a bit zany Steve is a standout.Two scenes, one with CJ heroically sacrificing his life to save the rest of the gang, and the other depicting Michael's utterly respectable retreat in the end, nearly made me cry.Note cameos from those behind the original Dawn (Tom Savini, Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger) as well as brief appearance of the director himself (shooting towards the audience with an automatic rifle during opening titles).Now I may say that I know a true definition to a word ""thrilling"": I felt my guts shriveled, my lower jaw dangled and my eyes pinned to the screen from the terrific 5th minute take-off until the final flash of the closing credits.Despite worn out topic the movie has to deal with, it is surprisingly refreshing and truly riveting even if considered to be more action than horror. A definitive roller-coaster ride from start to finish and a rarely good nasty little hell of a pure entertainment.I dare to assume (contrary to some prevailing views): The die-hard fans of the Romero's masterpiece shouldn't be disappointed.Just a parting thought - it was always a mystery to me: if they are so dumb (zombies, not fans) how do they tell the living from the dead and why don't they gnaw each other as much easier food?",Dawn of the Dead
323,shardy958855709,i liked it,8,22 October 2006,"All in all this is a good movie. Enjoyable, original (well the same theme as its original but had new twists), exciting of whats going to happen next and the characters had personalities. You either liked then and wanted them to survive or hated them and couldn't wait for them to be bitten. (actually thats one slight downfall, not many did get bitten and i think its only Ana's husband at the start we see getting bitten).The point about biting is one fault with the film, the other is a piece of blatant stating the bleeding obvious ever put into a movie, actually I'm nominating it for the Sybil Fawlty (see Fawlty Towers) Award For Stating the Bleeding Obvious. We are 40 minutes into a horror film about the living dead, people are being bitten (off screen) everywhere and turning quickly into zombies and Ana, the leading lady, states ""oh i think its the bites"". If id been on the cast, i would have ad-libed ""yeah well obviously"".Apart from that, i love this film",Dawn of the Dead
324,dogsrus-1,Very happy!,8,24 March 2004,"I saw this film tonight and was happy as can be! We went to the early, cheaper showing just in case it was gonna be a stinker. But this film is no stinker! A good time was had by all! We ate popcorn,yelped,jumped talked back to the film ""arrggh! No! what are you? Stupid?!!"", laughed and screamed once or twice. The zombies looked ""good"", the people were ""real"" enough for me and there was a dog(I was hoping there would be a mall puppy mill/pet store, with puppies that the people would have to consider as a food source and of course the ""good"" people would not eat puppies. Or would they??!! Hee hee) This film was fully worth the $6.50 we each paid to see it. Maybe it's not a huge classic, but it WAS FUN! I give it a big 7.

325,doodah367,Hit and miss affair really,5,19 March 2004,"The first ten minutes of this film promise so much more than it actually delivers.  Barely bothering to set up a static normal life premise, the film kicks right in with a loud and larger than life action opening - underlined by the late use of credits.  If the film had followed through on this premise, it would have delivered a ninety minute, unpretentious horror shlock, one that would have done Romero much more justice than what is actually produced.However, it is overly ambitious for a film that has to overcome so many initial obstacles (i.e. 1) its a horror film - often looked down on by serious cinemagoers and 2) its a remake of a horror film - surely representative of a lack of new ideas?).  Sometimes it appears to be encroaching a critique of contemporary society, and at other times it seems to be commenting on the last thirty years of horror films (without paying too close attention to detail, I picked up on nods to The Exorcist, It's Alive! and the Blair Witch Project).  All of these potentially subversive topics are all undermined by a seemingly ridiculous bit of pointless nationalism as the remaining protagonists sail off into the sunset, framed with the stars and stripes.However, the film isn't without its interesting experiments - self-reflexively juxtaposing different film making styles by switching between a standard Hollywood feel and digital video (in the same vein as Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later).  This pioneering is interesting, yet mildly shoddy - a more skilled director would have pulled it off seamlessly, whilst Dawn of the Dead wears its scars on its arm.Personally, I felt that a straight forward horror flick would have been better in these circumstances - and let any other motives be expressed unconsciously, a technique that Romero mastered in.5/10",Dawn of the Dead

327,Krush_Burner,Classic Remake of a Classic Horror,9,10 March 2015,"The basic question, which is always appears when one speaks about a remake is obvious: ""what's changed?"" Well, to cut a long story short – in this installment of a classic zombie horror everything is changed, but it is still ""Dawn Of The Dead"" – Turbo Edition now. Let us recall what original movie is. George A. Romero' s ""Dawn Of The Dead"" is an epic zombie horror with a strong elements of satire and social criticism. There's a lot of space to think and to interpret, but there's also a lot of character development and (of course, bloody) action. And – this is the first thing you should keep in mind while watching this remake – new ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the more bloody, more gory and more action-packed version of a Romero's tale. That means the second thing you need to know: no social commentary, no satirical components, there's only some minor references to it during the whole film. And third thing you should know about this film is very simple: this is a great remake. But (and one must always remember this) this is not a shot-by-shot re- edition of a classic; it is a retelling of classic story for a new generation. It is, therefore, a completely different film, even if it uses legacy from the predecessor. George Romero made a story about mindless consumer society (with zombies). Zack Snyder made a story about zombie apocalypse (with some surviving people).",Dawn of the Dead
328,jackstarr777,"Seriously fun, seat-edge, pure entertainment",9,17 June 2012,"I should start by saying, anyone looking for quality shouldn't watch this film. The effects are cheap, the dialogue is nothing special and the performances aren't top-notch. But for anybody looking to be entertained, this film is great. It starts off a little slow, but as the film progresses it gets quicker and edgier, and it soon evolves into one of the best horror films I've seen for a while.A reason for complaint from many fans of the original is the fast-running zombies, rather that the original's slow, shuffling zombies. I have yet to see the original, and though slow-paced zombies are generally more effective in other zombie movies I've seen, I was impressed by the zombies in this film. The cinematography was good at keeping you on the edge even without suspense. The zombies were startling and panicking, got your heart racing a bit more.Though the dialogue was nothing special, it doesn't at all drag on the film; it's nothing enlightening but it's bearable, especially for a zombie movie. Characterisation comes across fairly well, it has to be said, as most of the movie is not simple repetitive zombie splattering but interesting interactions between the survivors. A couple of the performances were a little cheesy - but really, you'll be too entertained to be bothered by it.The effects were quite bad - but the beauty of it is, for a film of this type, bad effects are better than good effects. It's like, we want it to be cheesy - and that's why it works. The CGI looked very unrealistic and unconvincing - but still, it does not drag down on the film.Most zombie film remakes have been denounced as some of the worst films ever made. But this one certainly stands out. In fact, for a remake on any kind it's impressing - I enjoyed it, and that's all I can say.8.6/10",Dawn of the Dead
329,leprutz13-1,Already seen stuff but New somehow,10,13 March 2008,"I gave this movie a ten out of ten because I think that Zack Snyder deserves it for his filming debut. I hated 300 Because it has absolutely nothing and Zack died this instance for me. But when I saw Dawn of the Dead, (I do hate zombie movies) I was amazed by the way he treated the story. Like many of the already seen zombieflicks, This movie has almost none of an explanation background. But The young director shows how you can turn something already seen lots of times, into something new and original. The way he treats the characters and their behaviour is different to what I have seen and creates a new kind of suspense.All in one It is just a movie for entertainment (what movies should be in some way) and I think it is worth a peek.",Dawn of the Dead
330,derboiler,Really boring...,1,29 April 2004,Just don't bother. I thought I would see a movie with great supspense and action.But it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start. In the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed. Towards the end the it gets better but not really great. I think the director took this movie just too serious. In such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action. I nearly dozed off in the middle/main part of it. Rating 3/10.derboiler.,Dawn of the Dead
331,greenflea2,Excellent zombie movie,10,14 January 2007,"I giving ten out of ten for a zombie movie, this is a first as zombie movies are normally low budget trash, more worried about blood and gore, than a decent story line.In general, a zombie plague spread via bites couldn't even take over the world, and could be easily contain by governments. So i find this hard to believe that zombies take over the world, unless it was something like bird flu. This movie does not waste time trying to explain how this plague started, none of the characters make any effort to work out, how did this all started.In one scene, a group of survivors are discussing how the plague spreads, like by bites. Yet standing with them is Terry who has been watching a news board-cast that informs that the plague is spread by bites. Yet Terry says nothing and just stands there, like a zombie.The movie is fast paced, full of action and never slows down, and gets boring. The story line is simple, a group of survivors hold up inside a shopping mall. I readied other people comments on why the survivors decided to leave the mall, that zombies are getting inside and food is running out. The fact is, zombies wasn't able to get inside the mall, and food wasn't in short supply. The reasons for wanting to leave, was daft, since the survivors was better off, staying were they are, not risking to leave, resulting in many of them been killed off. Of course they had to leave to bring more action to this movie, and dump off many characters in the progress.Another fault is, why don't they tried early in the piece in rescuing Andy and getting his weapons, since there wasn't many zombies around at that stage. And they only want to rescue him after his own food supply has run out.Another fault is, Anna has no problem in getting her truck over to the gun store, yet the two buses have many problems in escaping through the zombies.Since its a mall, there would be countless radios, yet none of the survivors bother to listened to radios for any updates, or if there was any other survivors, which the reality is, there would be.Despite its flaws, this movie is the best zombie movie i have seem, it has a good budget, a director, cast, production, everything. Which is freakish for a zombie movie, which are always low budget trash.",Dawn of the Dead
332,blue__yoshi,Solid,8,10 September 2004,"A great remake - not without faults but even the original had that stupid pie fight. Night of the Living Dead (not the awful 30th anniversary edition) is still the best zombie movie, but this is second on my list. I couldn't really say it scared me, but I've seen so many horror films I wonder if that's possible anymore. It was definitely entertaining though - I loved the opening.Any director who turned down S.W.A.T is alright with me. If someone wants to remake Day of the Dead I'd go and see that too.

333,jupiter2-6,A little bit too dead,7,22 March 2004,"While it has some new blood pumped into it, some things suffered from unintended anemia. The first 7 minutes gave it a great sense of urgency, it covered the outside world quite well and it seemed to be a hint of things to come. But once they were intrenched at the mall, there never seemed to be a real threat nor a sense of dread. Too many characters suddenly possessed a GI Joe personality rather than a true fear of what was happening around them, so it seemed fine just to hang out at the mall. Even the older woman seemed like she could take on anything so why not just sit tight and slowly pick them off. The zombies rarely were given a role to play so the eeriness and morbidity of the original was erased. The effects were quite beautiful but I didn't feel frightened of the what was out there. If the zombies periodically made their way in, it would have been more unsettling. Beside this remake being the most ""ungory"" of gore films, it all had the feeling of being done before especially with obvious references to earlier horror films like Aliens, Dawn Of The Dead, Body Snatchers and even Rosemary's Baby. Who didn't see that coming? This is from someone who is scared of his own reflection: I never flinched. The trailers and credits were more frightening. A pretty show, with some striking images but kinda flat at the same time, not to mention another 1 note performance by Ving. I will hope for better in the DVD release which will obviously have more ghastly footage. Oh, well.",Dawn of the Dead
334,charliecheswick,Loved it,7,14 October 2006,"First of all , don't watch this if you are looking for the next Citizen Kane. However , if you like a movie in which you can switch off your brain and sit back and enjoy a nonsensical movie then this one is for you. I like the original , and to be honest was expecting a poor interpretation , but I thought this was pretty good. Remake is probably not really the right word because other than the shopping mall and zombies, it doesn't really have the slow build up of tension that the original has. Instead it is a zombie movie for the teenagers of today - faster, more guts and blood, more pointless characters to kill off and more action. And overall it does work pretty well. There is only one poor part of the film , in which there is a bit of a lull in the action , and the attempt to spruce it up by introducing a teenage girl and a dog , doesn't really work.However the end sequence involving chainsaws and explosions more than makes up for this. If your looking for cheap thrills in a movie then this one will do the trick. There is also a pretty good soundtrack to accompany the action.",Dawn of the Dead
335,SteveRaccoon,"Strides out, grabs your attention, falls on its backside",4,27 August 2005,"I have no soap-box to stand on regarding the original version and this remake, I looked at this as an entirely unrelated film and this review is without fanboy mailce.First impressions.. bloody brilliant! It was high-octane and genuinely unsettling, the whole running-zombies doesn't cause me any concern either - admittedly some die-hard zombie fans were unimpressed but I think the majority will find them believable and quite acceptable. The opening shots in particular were a joy to behold. This delight continued till at least half way through the film, till things started going badly wrong with the script. Having laid it on thick that these characters are in a survival setting, the film starts inducing cretinism which spreads like a disease through the desperate band of survivors.It seems to me that the writer(s) ran out of ideas when it came to the grand finale, and resorted to bodging up the second half of the film in order to make something happen. It's easy to see the way the writer envisioned this, if only because the deterioration of the script is so profound.An irritating antagonist figure (who was never needed in the first place), a dog and a conveniently timed empty stomach all add up to a bizarre sequence of events that occurs where something a darn sight better should have. Won't elaborate - see for yourself if the idea of the film tickles you.Opportunities to darken the tone of the film, make the characters likable or at least someone you could be sympathetic towards are wasted. Character emotions are botched completely - misplaced 'romance' and cheesy lines seriously detract from the film. Again, this happens as a domino effect, no sign of this early in the film, then halfway through the stodge sets in fast.The most irritating thing is that if the film had continued in the same vein as it had started, this would probably be one of my favourite films, period. As it is, I can't stand to even watch the thing again.Despite having a marked dislike for the end product and scoring it as such, I would expect the majority of horror fans to enjoy this, with two exceptions:A) Hardcore zombie fans who are really into the idea of zombies slowly shuffling - softly softly catchee meatbag style. B) Those who've ever thought ""what the hell are you doing!? That's just stupid"" when seeing this kind of film. Some argue that this kind of dumbness is a necessity in slasher type films, but to me the film set the scene with arguing survivors in a situation and promptly made them act like complete chimps because nobody could figure a way of playing the film out properly.If nothing said here puts you off then please do go ahead and enjoy yourself with this film, regardless of the factors which get right up my nose it can't be said that the film has no merits.",Dawn of the Dead
336,HockeyFan13,IT could have been....,5,16 August 2006,"This movie could have been easily the best of the ""Zombie genre"" and had a chance to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Then a certain scene happens known as the ""baby scene"" that while not wanting to ruin it for people who have not seen it makes you think that you have suddenly been shuffled into another movie. Its not the scene itself I have such a problem with, but its what the characters do immediately after the scene is over. What was a tense, edge of your seat thriller became a clichéd horribly thought out third act that basically ruins the greatness of the first two thirds. What the characters choose to do is so asinine and stupid you just throw your hands up realizing another Hollywood blown opportunity to do the horror genre justice. Think of it this way, and Boston fans can understand this, your up 8-0 in the bottom of the 7th in game 7 of the World Series and your set up man and closer wind up blowing the lead behind 6 errors and horrid pitching.

339,josephtheowl,A look at the bigger picture,9,15 December 2006,"It was in this one episode of ""The X-Files"" called Hollywood A.D., where Agents Mulder and Scully are discussing the true nature of zombies. Mulder asks why is it that when the dead come back to life they only want to hurt people. The more skeptical Scully mentions that ghosts and zombies are a representation of our own repressed violent and sexual urges, that zombies are what we fear most about our identity: deep down, we are mindless automatons that only kill and eat. There's a horrific truth to that kind of deadly simplicity. Zombies are traditionally impulsive, acting only on hunger.Which is why the mall setting in both versions of Dawn of the Dead is so appropriate. Where once malls were a place for consumers to empty their wallets, it is now a target for LITERAL consumers to fill their stomachs. There may be an underlying morbid humor behind commercialism saving us from ourselves. That perhaps the only thing that separates us from them is our rationale to succeed.Each character represents a generalized version of ourselves placed in emergency situations. Once we become gripped with fear, how we lose faith, how we feel helpless, how we learn the hard meaning of sacrifice, how much we change, how much we learn about ourselves, and only very rarely are we ever rational beings toward one another begins to show. There was a message behind the scene where Andre (Mekhi Phifer) shoots Norma (Jayne Eastwood) after she discovers his pregnant wife is now a member of the living dead. It said something about man's capability to murder each other out of desperation, whereas zombies never seem to harm other zombies. In fact, because of human flaws like petty arrogance and personality differences, the zombies are actually better coordinated and work more efficiently together than we do. That could be the reason why the undead were able to score such a swift victory over the living.I'm convinced that the film could have started right after Ana (Sarah Polley) awakens from crashing her vehicle. Obviously the movie isn't perfect, but the scenes where the survivors in the mall are engaging in basically everyday activities (playing chess, having sex, hitting golf balls) shows that the people haven't forgotten their past, familiar lives, and that amidst all of the carnage they have a way to remember life before the end of the world.",Dawn of the Dead
340,dmkay,Dreadful Dawn,3,21 March 2004,"I'm not completely against remakes.  They can be good, like The Thing or The Fly, or they can be OK, like last year's Texas Chainsaw.  This one, Dawn of the Dead 2004, is one of the most unholy God-awful piece of s**t remakes I've ever seen.  None of the humor, social commentary, sense of dread or awe or loneliness that made the original so great is present here.  The characters are the kind of stupid idiots usually found in a Friday the 13th film, who go wandering off by themselves to investigate noises totally unarmed.  It takes them way too long to realize how zomibifaction (?) is spread, and they fail to take simple obvious precautions that anyone would take.  The mall fails to feel like a real place, partly because we never get a sense of its size like we did in the original.  This is really just an inferior version of 28 Days Later set in a mall.I'm giving this 3 out of 10.  I'll give it higher than a 1 just for the scenes involving Andy (the rooftop neighbor) which are clever and give us some trace of the original's charm.  Plus, the early scenes where everything starts to go to hell are done well.  Otherwise, this stinking zombie pile smells even worse than Resident Evil, and that's pretty bad.",Dawn of the Dead
341,Simmonz,Easily the Best Horror Movie of Recent Memory,9,25 March 2004,"I had wanted to see the original before I saw this remake, but when a friend asked out of the blue if I wanted to see it, I couldn't resist. I still intend to see the original, but this 2004 version was a excellent film in its own right. I didn't find it very scary, but I didn't go to be scared. The zombies were very well done, the added humour really offsets the more graphic scenes well. I found that they took your mind off the theme of the film, so when the action set back in, it would catch you off guard. The ending left me a little disapointed, but it wasn't all bad. I found that as a horror movie, it was better than most of the more recent horror films I saw,  like F vs J, and Jeepers Creepers 2. Well, only other thing I can add, is that the action scenes were great, plot was decently done ( I have  a few holes I noticed), movie was a bit rushed, but its not a big deal, and as said before, watch the end credits, it will be worth it.
9/10, excellent movie.",Dawn of the Dead
342,Doctor_Cheese,Above-Average Entry in a Crap-Ridden Horror Subgenre,7,22 March 2004,"The first thing that needs to be said about this movie is that it is a completely different animal from the 1978 horror masterpiece by zombie auteur George A. Romero.  The two films share a title and a few superficial details of plot and setting, but other than that, they have little in common.  This movie is not as philosophically deep, intelligent, witty, or suspenseful as Romero's. It's a strictly modern horror flick, and by `modern' I mean that it has typically shallow, flat characters; frequently stupid and vulgar dialogue; and that annoying, MTV-style, this-might-be-scary-if-you-could-tell-what-the-****-was-happening kind of editing. If you go into it with this in mind, you will enjoy it more.And so the next thing that needs to be said is that, despite its self-imposed limitations as an ADD-generation movie, the new `Dawn' still manages to be above-average zombie flesh-eating entertainment -- easily the best entry in this horror subgenre in years (though, considering all the crap out there, that isn't saying a whole lot). So before I get to my list of cons/pet peeves, I'll mention some of the positive aspects of this movie.First, the changes to the story go beyond the standard, gratuitous, change-for-the-sake-of-change sort. There are some truly inventive elements here, such as the impressive scenes of devastation at the beginning of the film, the lone survivor on the rooftop across from our heroes and their relationship with him, and the well done `Blair Witch' style coda during the end credits. Overall, the whole `zombie epidemic' is handled pretty slickly and without any of that snarky, postmodern self-consciousness that sinks so many remakes of well-known classics.Next, although the zombie splatter action is not as over-the-top graphic as it is in Romero's classics, director Zack Snyder avoids the cop-out cutaway shot often enough to satisfy at least the casual gorehound. (Actually, some scenes serve to remind just how wimpy your average splatter horror movie has become these days.)And while it's true that the powerful subtext of Romero's work and his sardonic wit are absent in the new `Dawn,' there are still some moments of black comedy that really are pretty funny. (Watch for the `celebrity' shoot-'em-up sequence for a prime example.)Finally, the music selections are inspired, from Johnny Cash in the opening credits to Richard Cheese during the midpoint comic relief to `People Who Died' by the Jim Carroll Band during the closing credits (I didn't think more than a handful of people even knew that song existed). Throw in some well placed muzak selections, and it becomes clear that someone with a brain deliberately worked on the soundtrack. Awesome!Now for the bad things. Perhaps most prominently, the movie suffers from the `modern' attributes mentioned above. The characters are not given a chance to truly develop; you never really know any of them and, hence, don't particularly care about them. To be fair, I think screenwriter James Gunn did make an effort to infuse some life into our intrepid heroes, but there are just too many characters (read: zombie fodder) for even the most skilled writer to develop. As a result, what characterization there is almost seems like an afterthought, and some of the actions of the characters are just inexplicable. (I suspect the DVD, when it comes out, may offer a number of deleted scenes that help, ahem, flesh things out more.)Nobody watches zombie movies for the dialogue, but I wish Hollywood screenwriters didn't feel the need to gratuitously throw the `f-word' and other assorted obscenities into every other sentence. I'm not prudishly averse to cussing, but a forced excess of expletives just detracts from the import of what's actually said and reminds viewers of the inherently juvenile nature of Hollywood moviemaking these days.As for the MTV-video style editing, do I really need to explain how much better it would be if the director let your eye focus on the action for more than a tenth of a second?Overall, the new `Dawn' owes more to `28 Days Later' than its namesake, at least as far as the zombie mythology goes. Like Romero's films, the cause of the zombie plague is unknown, and also like in Romero's films, it doesn't matter. Unlike Romero's films, however, the clues point more to a virus, as in Danny Boyle's pseudo-zombie epic. Here the zombies are definitely dead, but they also movie rapidly, again as in `28 Days Later.' And although I prefer the creeping sense of dread of Romero's slow-moving animated corpses, I found the fast zombies didn't bother me as much as I thought they would. What really bothered me was the stupid wildcat noises they made when they attacked. Why would walking (ok, running) corpses make noises like that? Dumb.However, in the movie's favor, the zombies here sometimes make more sense than Romero's.  In particular, there's one scene where a zombie is chasing down someone to eat, but then abruptly breaks off pursuit as soon as he spots an easier mark. Romero's zombies like to kill people, begin eating them, then stop as soon as they see someone else to kill, leaving you to wonder why they would bother chasing someone else when they already have something to eat.Oh well. In the end, as Chief McLellan from `Night of the Living Dead' puts it, `They're dead. They're all messed up.'Not a masterpiece, but still recommended for fans of the living dead.",Dawn of the Dead
343,wtbe7560,Romero needs to take some notes,8,11 July 2005,"George Romero should rent this movie and take notes, this is how a zombie movie SHOULD BE! All the Romero fanboys decried this movie as horrible and whined about how Dawn '78 was better, but they were WRONG. This movie does it all the right way - fast pacing, good dialog, and it's not weighed down by the ""social commentary"".The Romero defenders were quick to point out how running zombies were ""not believable"". If you're willing to give enough leeway to accept that the dead are coming back to life, then why couldn't they run? Running zombies sure make more sense than the ""intelligent"" zombies Romero is putting out now.It takes a lot to make my hair stand on end, and this movie did it. Within the first ten minutes even the most hardened horror fan should be disturbed and entertained. This movie offers a fresher, and in my opinion more realistic, look at the end of times than its predecessor. The scene with the birth of Andre's baby in the mall is perhaps the most disturbing of any film of recent note. Some scenes do drag out - the dinner scene at the mall seems to go on forever - but these lapses are more than covered by the action scenes. Hopefully, Snyder and crew will be making another Dead movie soon.",Dawn of the Dead
344,Cyk,A review from someone who has never seen the original,8,23 March 2004,"Yep, I never saw the original.With that in mind, I liked it. I like zombie movies as a general rule; if you don't, you won't like this one either.If you do, you'll enjoy watching this one. Will you like it? Maybe, maybe not. You'll jump a few times, and you'll want to know what's going to happen next. Excellent performances by Mekhi Phifer and Michael Kelly. Gorier than 28 Days Later, and with better gore than most horror movies. Keep your ears ready for a bizarre version of The Disturbed's ""Down With the Sickness"", which has been slowed to almost lullabye speed. I didn't recognize it til I wondered why everyone in the theatre was laughing. I gave it 8/10; that means I'll buy the DVD, but probably won't ever consider it to have been an especially brilliant movie. Final advice: Go see it if you like horror flicks. Don't bother if you don't like horror or if you're squeamish.",Dawn of the Dead
345,Sam_Youno,One of the great zombie movies - - - if you're not too picky,8,18 January 2014,"A random group of Navy SEALS sharpshooters, Israeli SWAT team members and Wild West gunslingers find themselves trapped in a Milwaukee shopping mall. . . . Okay, they're really supposed to be an ordinary group of strangers. I merely wish to point out that of the roughly 47 gazillion shots fired in the course of this film, not a one of them misses. To kill a zombie, of course, you have to shoot it in the head---not an easy shot even if both shooter and target are stationary. But we get a feeble old man shooting two handguns while being dragged backward; a guy who didn't know where his safety catch was, dispatching dozens of zombies - - - BANG!--Another zombie down. You get the idea.This isn't criticism; I'm giving this film 8 out of 10. But you should know, if watching it for the first time, that you'll be asked not only to suspend disbelief, but to hang disbelief by the neck until dead. Plot holes are too numerous to mention; logic (even the film's internal logic) is gently slid off to the side and into oblivion; numerous major questions are never answered, notably how the sudden zombie virus originated, apparently overnight. Oh, lots of stuff.How, then, an 8 out of 10? Because ""Dawn of the Dead,"" unlike any other zombie film I've seen (full disclosure here: I have NOT seen the 1978 original), clearly had someone with a brain behind it. Maybe even two such someones! There's good, chiseled dialogue; consistent understatement (an early, excellent example is the TV news flash while Ana and her hubby are otherwise engaged; we're not told what the news flash is about---just that there is one); and even some character development! (Well, not the zombies; they pretty much just keep on doing what zombies do.) Also, as other IMDb reviewers have pointed out, very effective flashes of humour, the best being the scene in which the lead characters, communicating by sign with a gun-shop owner stranded atop his store across the street, suggest targets---""Burt Reynolds""--- and the gun guy takes aim and blows away the shambling zombie who resembles Burt Reynolds.My only serious complaint with this immensely entertaining film is the portrayal of the zombies. You'd think that someone would find some workable variant on the universal zombie standard: arms outstretched, bloody mouth, eyes circled in kohl for that sunken look. It's a tried and true formula, but watch enough zombie films and you just get tired.",Dawn of the Dead
346,TwoThirdsMajority,Proves that a remake can be superior than the original.,10,16 March 2007,"You're Sarah Polley. You're sleeping with your hubby in a bed. Then your little neighbor girl came to your room. She's covered in blood. Her mouth is covered in blood. And you know what? She's become a zombie! And your hubby is worried.

Welcome to the Milwaukee county neighborhood. A few hours ago, it was a safe haven, an utopia filled with happy middle-class people who are not British chavs or Southern hillbillies. But now, it's a warzone! No, it's not attacked by damn dirty apes, or the Soviet Ruskies, we're being attacked by zombies! And if you're a Romero fan or have read the book The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks, you'll know that sh*t happens when zombies attack! Directed by Zack ""Spartan"" Snyder, this movie tells about Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Webber, Mekhi Phifer, Inna Korobkina, Lindy Booth and 3 more people entering a mall, having fun inside the mall, and getting out of the mall.The zombies. what about them? Well, they bite people, and they'll bite anyone in sight who is people. And you know what? They're fast! As in an Olympic runner fast. All thanks to Danny Boyle for inventing such brilliant creatures, first seen in 28 Days Later.The script? Well, it's the same thing from the original, except that there's no racism, and they added a cause for the zombie outbreak: virus. Which is good, since the almighty original points no reason for the outbreak, which has made everyone go cliffhanger in the end of the film.THe verdict: Great film.

I loved the movie from the very beginning, but towards the middle it was ridiculously gory and there were hardly any scares. It was also quite boring at times, but it did have its great parts. SPOILER ALERT In the beggining when the little girl walks into the room and a huge chunk of skin on her face is missing, exposing blood and muscles, I got scared. Then she takes a huge chunk out of Ana's husband's neck. Blood spurts everywhere, and Ana throws the girl out of the room and locks the door.

But I have to rate it badly because it is a remake of a brilliant film...and most of the things that made the original excellent were omitted from the remake. This is yet another film that banks on recognition of its elder, and does not really respect the source.The omissions are substantial. Romero's film starts out with media confusion and a look at what the authorities are doing to combat the living dead. Even as hell is breaking out, media talking heads argue with each other. This is left out in the remake, missing the opportunity for satire, and narrowing the scope of the film. The group's presence in the mall is a brilliant testimony to the emptiness of material things, but this was omitted in the remake. This is the whole point of them being in the mall in the first place! The bikers overwhelm the mall at point in the original, showing man to be as savage as the enemy (and perhaps even deserving the plague of the living dead?) this was omitted as well.Everything that makes Romero's movies more than a bit of splatter was left out. (Oh, and zombie babies are not horrifying, they are comic. Ask Peter Jackson.)So why remake a film classic, if you aren't going to introduce the elements that make it great?

351,bradman1118,one of the few horror remakes that may actually exceed the original!,9,3 December 2014,"Dawn of the Dead is directed by Zack Snyder, the director/writer of such films as 300, 300: Rise of an Empire, Man of Steel, etc. It is a remake of George Romero's second movie of the same name. There is A LOT to love about Dawn of the Dead. Firstly, it gets into the action right away. The original film spent a decent amount of time developing the characters and the idea of a zombie apocalypse, while this one wastes no time before the terror and suspense begins! It is the same premise as the original movie but rather than making a shot-for-shot remake, this movie actually goes in another direction and works on it's own terms. There are several differences, the main one being that the zombies run and do not follow Romero's rule. While it may not have as much of the human drama that made the original great, it is still a VERY fun time; it is scary, suspenseful, gory, has great action scenes, and a great survival/apocalypse element to it. Another thing I liked is the feeling of isolation. The original film had an element in which there were biker gangs hanging out outside the mall. This evoked a feeling that it is not truly the apocalypse and everybody is surviving in their own ways. That element is not present in this movie, and it has a feeling of isolation and dread that is present in many other great survival/horror movies like the Mist or the Descent. When watching Dawn of the Dead, it is important to view it for what it is worth, zombies, gore, suspense, action, and scares. There is no deeper meaning. There is no political metaphor like in 28 Days Later. If you view it as a straight-up zombie-thriller that you can have a good time with, I guarantee you will enjoy it.",Dawn of the Dead
352,severin72,Interesting cultural artifact.,5,18 March 2007,"Just about every film has its good and bad points. This is the first one I can recall that lines them up in such a way that we start with the best and then decline inexorably to the worst. The opening is simply brilliant in concept and execution. The depiction of the world coming, to all intents and purposes, to an end while people go about their daily lives, the lack of explanation, and the depictions of wildly accelerating chaos to the tune of Johnny Cash's cunningly chosen ""When the man comes around"" are inspired. The characters behave sufficiently believably that the situation itself becomes real. About ten minutes in things are looking good - and then the problems set in. The choice of having the zombies be fast and rabid instead of lumbering makes them scarier and far more formidable antagonists and it taps in to the current fear of pandemics adding an edge of realism to the terror. The problem is that it makes the choice of a shopping mall as a suitable fortress even more unlikely than in the original. The idea these zombies would be unable to break right in doesn't stand up to scrutiny. It also makes it impossible to recreate the satire of consumerism that drove Romero to choose the mall as the setting for his 1978 film. No zombies wandering around the stores here. What we're left with is the ""small band of heroes battling monstrous horde"" template that fits equally well over, Aliens, Starship Troopers, Eight Legged Freaks - the list goes on, and it's not enough to sustain interest. The gore lacks the leering voyeurism of Romero's collaborations with Tom Savini (who, perhaps inevitably, has a cameo as a Sheriff) but, even if director Zack Snyder doesn't linger on it it's strong enough. The laboriously set up ""chainsaw accident"" is gratuitous and silly. The rest just becomes tiresome out of sheer repetition. If you can, skip the end credit sequence. Utterly pointless nudity and despair are tacked on for no better reason than ""because we could"". Just as ""Underworld: Evolution"" marked the sorry point at which we sank from films as two hour music videos to films as two hour video games there has to be some wretched significance in going from re-makes and sequels to re-makes OF sequels. Viewed in isolation this isn't an awful film it just constitutes further evidence that, as a culture, we're pretty much terminally out of ideas.",Dawn of the Dead
353,Seamus-25,Great fun,8,30 March 2004,"This is not a scary movie - it is a Zombie movie and it does it well. The cast performed their roles well - nothing oscar worthy of course but perfect performances for the film.There are several comedy moments (intentional) and these make a welcome break in the tension of the film.Everything kicks off fairly quickly - no pointless hour long examination of how origin of the Zombies (I imagine this is covered in the previous incarnation - although it is a while since i have seen the remake of The Night Of The Living Dead). I am a fan of the original trilogy and I still enjoyed this sequel - the gore is more believable as you would expect in an update (blood is slightly less fluorescent than in the original) the shocks are there, the updated Zombies are excellent - they are fast and dangerous - a big problem i had with the original was that the ""Shuffling Zombies"" required you to be very very very careless to be caught by them - not these new ones, they will chase you down and tear you apart given half the chance.More could have been made of them being holed up in the Shopping Mall, like in the original, you never felt they were in any serious threat inside the Mall from the Zombies - although this was adequately replaced by a fear of each other.Stay all the way to the end credits as more action occurs during these - I liked this way of ending - it would have been a ""Too many endings"" syndrome if they had tried to put this in as a traditional end of the film but making it interspersed during the credits was a nice touch.See this film if you are not upset by gore, not expecting a frame-by-frame remake of the original (why would anybody bother to do this - Take Note producers of the Psycho remake), or expecting a reworking of a literary classic - this movie does not try to be any of these things and lets you enjoy it for it's own merits8/10",Dawn of the Dead

355,Ithorianjedimaster2,A Masterpiece looked upon as a cheap remake,8,24 February 2008,"Just the name ""Dawn of the Dead"" sends shivers down my spine. As a zombie fanatic, I absolutely love George Romero's movies, especially ""Dawn of the Dead"". Then, a few years ago, I saw a trailer for this movie and when the title appears on screen, I was immediately excited. After a long wait, I have to say that despite the fact that I've seen it numerous times now, it is still a frighteningly realistic look at a world that may surpass that of George Romero himself.The story revolves around Ana, an employee at a local hospital, who comes home, spends some 'quality time' with her husband, and as they drift off the sleep, that's when it all begins *chuckles*. When Ana wakes up, she finds herself in a whole different world. A neighbor girl walks into her room, bites and tears a few veins from her husband's neck, and if that wasn't bad enough, after Ana closes the door, locking the little girl out, her own husband gets up and attacks her. Following is the first look at the horrifying image of a zombie SPRINTING after Ana's car. Soon, Ana crashes her car, wakes up with a shotgun aimed at her head by my favorite character, big bad no-holds-barred Kenneth, then they meet up with more survivors and the plot from the classic ""Dawn of the Dead"" kicks in.First off, I don't care how many people whine and b**** about the sprinting zombies. Zack Snyder's idea of ""If they see you, you're f***ed"" when it comes to encounters with zombies makes a lot of tension in the movie. In the classic George Romero film, the survivors harmlessly ran around the shuffling, moaning zombies, which kind of eliminated some of the fear that revolved around them. In the remake, with the sprinting undead, it becomes clear that the threat is extreme and makes for a more tense film.The acting is superb, with delightful performances by Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames. The zombie make-up? Watching the dead slowly decay over the movie's timespand makes for a realistic feel. There's plenty of jump-out-of-nowhere moments and lots of suspense that will make a zombie fan turn off the DVD feeling extremely satisfied. The clichés that have plagued many horror movies are ABSENT here. The characters are all original, like the redeeming gangster, the TV salesman, the trucker, etc.Of course, this movie is only getting 9 out of 10 because there isn't a sequel in sight, but then again, maybe I should change that since masterpieces like ""300"" and soon-to-be ""The Watchmen"" is bound to be all that is on Zack Snyder's mind. Why this movie isn't on the Top 250, I don't know. Maybe there are just too many uptight zombie fans who can't accept the fact that Zack Snyder did what no other director could do, take George Romero's golden film and perfect it in nearly every aspect. Bravo, Mr. Snyder, bravo!",Dawn of the Dead
356,Daelock,Epitomizes What Modern Horror Should Be,8,21 March 2004,"I'll keep it short since I haven't seen the original and most people seem to have made up their minds about whether or not to see it. This is a vicious movie. It's not necessarily the most violent ever, but it's certainly vicious. It has an intensity lacking from many modern horror films, especially from the zombie ones. The idea of swift zombies rather than the lurching ones is not new, 28 Days Later had it and as a result many comparisons have been drawn between the two movies, but I don't think it's fair. 28 Days Later was more about the human condition(I personally forgot about the zombie menace in the second half in light of the human nature aspect) while this one focuses on the zombies and their effect on people. This generates some truly genuinely moving scenes, mostly revolving around Mekhi Pfeifer's(I have no clue if that was spelled right) character and the character of a gun salesman trapped on his shop's roof. This movie is truly powerful in some parts. I thoroughly enjoyed it overall.",Dawn of the Dead

But under the decomposing skin and ""Grrrrr"" of the zombies that made this movie (as well as the original) famous, this is really about the human race surviving in the darkest time the human race can go through.A group of people are locked in a shopping centre, and they have to keep the zombies out, and survive with what the shopping centre has (chips, popcorn, sofas, beds, etc.)They have a friend across the street who of course, gets killed by the zombies after a harrowing and suspenseful period of time where the characters have to sneak past the zombies.George A. Romero must have been involved other than writing the original, because this has the Romero touch to it. There were a few unnecessary and predictable scenes, but you can't have a scary movie without unnecessary and predictable scenes, it wouldn't be horror then, would it? :)The only unnecessary scene was the two characters recording themselves having sex...but that might just be in the director's cut (the one I saw.)

Even though I saw the original several times in the theater when it first came out, I was able to enjoy this one a lot also. No, this is not a remake as in ""true to the original"". It is an update of that concept, with some welcome homages to the original thrown in (Gaylen Ross Fashions? Cool!). I've already heard a lot of criticism out here, but really, I think people need to refresh their perspective, put their pre-conceived notions to the side and enjoy it for what it is: a truly original concept that was created in 1978, updated here to tell the story of another group of people fighting their way through this incredibly impossible situation. Didn't you wonder, watching the original over the years, about other people and their stories of trying to survive the situation? I know I did. And after all, if Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger (not to mention the great one, Tom Savini) lent their endorsement to this project by being in it, why knock it? Relax and enjoy! My  rating: 9 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
359,jguz58,Get the unrated director's cut!!!,9,22 November 2004,"I reviewed this film back in March 2004, and said, ""Wow! I just got home from seeing dotd-2004 and can't wait to add it to my collection."" Well, I just added it - the Unrated Director's Cut in widescreen edition. After watching it this weekend, I just had to add a footnote about this version of the film. IT MAKES A GREAT FILM EVEN BETTER.Comments from other reviewers have sometimes made reference to a lack of character development in the film. The UDC version restores this kind of content, and is one way that the UDC version improves on the theatrical release. I see better character development in this version of dotd-2004 then in the (1978) original version of Dawn.The other improvement the UDC version makes is to restore some really excellent gore shots. If you're into that thing, of course. And if you're not - well of course you're into it - that's why you're checking out this film!",Dawn of the Dead
360,vladthelad8666,Best remake ever?,9,26 August 2020,"You really don't hear this often, most times a remake of a classic does not live up to expectations, but director Zack Snyder picked it up, made it fresh and added new features, that will become a must in almost every zombie flick after 2004. The movie is a perfect mix of intensity, comedy, drama, and the occasional chewing on guts. Yes, it's really self aware and knows exactly what kind of movie it is, which will bring much needed entertainment to long time hardcore zombie fans, who have probably facepalmed one too many times at all the bad undead movie tropes.Dawn of the Dead has probably one of the best opening scenes in any movie ever. it's just carnage all over the globe, while ""The Man Comes Around"" by Johnny Cash plays over the footage. Very simple. yet works on all levels. The classic line ""When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"" spoken by a televangelist perfectly sumps up how the movie can balance between serious unnerving scenes and cheeky lighthearted dialogue. It has funny moments, where the characters do random stuff all over the mall they are trapped in, and scenes which I never thought i'd see in a movie (zombie baby of course). A new addition to this remake are the running undead, personally they are much preferred over their slow counterparts. It's another trope that will become a staple in the zombie subgenreq mainly due to the success of this movie and ""28 Days Later"".Said characters are nothing fresh or new, but they don't need to be. You have a bunch of ordinary folks, who team up to fight the undead. Most of them have nothing going on, and there isn't much to like. but it's the closest it can get to real people. There is an attempt to create subplots, which involve love connections and personal interests, and while some of them get explored to some extent, none of them get resolved, but that too can add to the realism aspect.Almost every shot in the movie is great, considering it takes place in a shopping mall most of the time, although i'm kind of puzzled about that slow motion shotgun shot, that happens in the third act of the movie, but i'll let it slide. Another thing worth mentioning, is that this movie makes Disturbed listenable, referring to the end credits scene, where the remaining survivors find a small island, which unfortunately is infested with zombies, and their fate remains unknown to this day.Definitely worth watching or rewatching Dawn of the Dead, one of the best remakes to this day, so good it doesn't even need a sequel.",Dawn of the Dead
361,stimpil,Note to Rob Zombie: this is how you do an homage.,8,13 September 2005,"Zombie to-do list: 1. Eat brains 2. Moan a lot 3. Look messed up 4. MEmnNASmAMmNa UHHhhhuhhh 5. Eat brains Gone is the subtle, serious horror of Romero's Night of the Living Dead; fortunately, it's been replaced with funny, suspenseful, and action-packed scenes. It plays kind of like a Resident Evil video game, which may or may not be appealing to you. I thought it kicked ass. This movie jumps right into the action, giving you only about 3 minutes of background and build-up. Anna (played by Canuck Sarah Polley) is a nurse, people start turning into Zombies, and she high-tails it out of her neighborhood. It sounds terse, but it all happens about that fast. She meets up with a few other survivors, and they hide out in the local mall, fighting for survival. Sure, they're stuck in a shopping mall, hiding from hordes of vicious zombies, but think of all the great stuff they can get at Sears! The oddest thing about this movie is, after we left, I actually had a discussion with my girlfriend about whether or not I would ""kill"" her if she turned into a zombie. Yes, an actual conversation. I couldn't convince her that the only things on a zombie's mind are ""Eat brains"" and ""MEmnNASmAMmNa UHHhhhuhhh""; she was upset that I would do my duty to humanity and destroy the undead version of her. I think a milestone in any relationship is when you can come to terms with the fact that your partner would eradicate your living corpse - I think I stole that from a Hallmark card.",Dawn of the Dead
362,cmivie,"Another remake, but at least Dawn isn't all that bad.",7,30 December 2004,"Hollywood is suffering from a new disease...........remakeitis! So far in 2004, we have seen remakes of Flight of the Phoenix, Stepford Wives, Walking Tall and Dawn of the Dead. And their are more to come in 2005, which tells me that ideas are scarce in Hollywood. I'm not dogging remakes. But with the increase we have seen just in the last few years, I really am starting to worry that studios are abandoning ""original"" ideas. In any case, when I heard that Dawn was going to be remade, my first thought was that it really couldn't be any worse than the original. I know the original Dawn has a cult-like following, but in all honesty that film is not very good.So..........what about the 2004 version? Well, let me say this. The remake is good, when you compare it to the original. But, I do have several problems with this film. I'll get to those in a second. Let me address the positives.First of all, this film does not follow the original in every detail. Most remakes don't, but for Dawn this was actually the best choice. Dawn is all about one thing...........survival. We have a group of people that are simply trying to survive. I like the fact that the group becomes a family of sorts, realizing that they need one another to survive. I also liked how Ving Rhames was the only true bad-ass in the film. He is a cop, so it is to be expected. But Rhames (as he usually does) plays this part so well that you love it when he starts to accumulate a high body count of zombies. I liked the diversity of characters. A salesman, a nurse, a gay organ player for a church, a playboy, a jerk security guard...........as that diversity meshes really well in this film. I also liked how in the midst of all the chaos, the characters get to know one another, meaning we get to know who they are. A lot of time, films like Dawn look past this aspect. I'm glad the director didn't do that. And then their is the segment that had me rolling..........and for you Disturbed fans out their, you know what I am talking about. Using Disturbed's ""The Sickness"", they had some guy singing the song in a Frank Sinatra style that just was so funny, I had to play the over again. It is pure genius to use this song in the film, but to do it in this way was just so damn funny.Now, the bad stuff. I guess their is a handbook out their entitled ""What to do when Zombies attack"". And in that book, the author must have stated that the first place to seek shelter is..........The Mall! And wouldn't you know, the zombies must have known this (or maybe the author turned into a zombie and told all his zombie buddies that survivors will flock to the mall) cause right before our group of survivors can get into the mall, the zombies show up. Okay, I can live with this. But I refuse to accept that mall security guards will be packing heat. In Dawn, the security guys are packing, which was a terrible thing to have in the film. Then, this movie wasted Mekhi Phiefer's talents. If you watch ER, then you know this guy is one hell of an actor. Here, he is wasted. Lastly, this film is not a horror movie. It is an action film with zombies. Their really isn't anything scary about this film. The zombies look great, meaning they look hideous and scary. But the film is not a horror film.Overall, Dawn is good for what it is, and it is actually a remake that is better than the original. Having Rhames as the lead character was a great call, cause anybody else in that role just wouldn't work. I think Ving is one of the most under-appreciated actors today. But I also have to mention Jake Weber, mostly because I hope this film will give him more exposure. The guy is a great talent, and he plays his part so well that you really feel for him in the end. Those two made this movie for me.",Dawn of the Dead
363,RolandCPhillips,Yee-Haa!!!,7,29 September 2004,"Okay, first: this isn't as good as the Romero original. It does away with the vast majority of the thematic impact, symbolism and subtext. It's less distressing and less troubling.But it's absolutely fantastic entertainment. Zack Snyder gets much of the exposition out of the way a.s.a.p. and includes some impressive photography to demonstrate how the characters cloistered lives are about to explode with unfathomable events. Then he holds the survivors up in a deserted mall, surrounds them with the undead and lets the flesh fly. It takes a different enough approach to stand independently from the original.Sure, DotD doesn't show any great narrative flair. Of course its pacy and exciting, but is powered by incident: action sequences and dilemmas keep the action bowling along, not thematic issues. Furthermore, James Gunn's screenplay is fairly conventional and there are perhaps too many characters here. But I say again: it's fantastic fun.Crash, bang and wallop. People die in large numbers. Guns go blam. People do stupid stuff in Armageddon. And there is a bucket load of sick humour. Plus stupid gags about obesity and the cult of celebrity (DIE!!!).Those of sensitive disposition/easily offended would do well to avoid this because Snyder takes no prisoners and makes no concessions. This is tailor made for the anti-establishment or (more likely) the GoreHound Gang. Either way, you're in for a ball. The film has great energy in pushing things forward to an unpleasant conclusion, never relenting and constantly pounding you with sound and fury. Matthew F. Leonetti contributes great cinematography, shooting everything in an appropriately rotten colour pallet, Tyler Bates scores excoriating music and Ving Rhames (great) and Sarah Polley (just as good) go through hell with heads held high. And numerous obnoxious characters get scragged.I could give you a better idea of the scenario and story, but I won't. Just get the DVD, a load of friends, plenty of beer and Chinese take-away, sit back and relax  and be battered. Some may take that as a warning, so beware that this isn't a particularly pleasant experience. But what did you expect?Note to film-makers: I loved the use of Johnny Cash in the opening credits.",Dawn of the Dead
364,Cheddar,Has Its Moments,7,10 March 2007,"We take these sorts of movies pretty seriously here in Pittsburgh, the home of George Romero and where ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" were shot. (The shopping mall in the original is just a couple of miles from me.) I've just seen the '04 ""DOTD"" and have mixed feelings though more favorable than not. My first response was that the special effects getting better over the years is a mixed blessing -- you get that whiz-bang sense from seeing torsos chainsawed, but I think it makes directors a bit lazy in creating tension and fear.I'm reminded of ""Evil Dead 2,"" the Sam Raimi movie made on a shoestring budget that forced its creators to look for different, less extravagant ways of scaring people. I'd recommend it over this movie unless you're strictly a blood and gore fan. (And both movies have chainsaws!) If you like blood and gore, this movie made for you.But this movie isn't without its jump-out-of-your-seat moments and when it has them, they are pretty tasty. There are nice touches like the dry erase board chess match and the snipe-the-celebrities game.I came out of watching glad I'd seen it but more glad I hadn't paid $10 for it in a theater.See all of you at the (human) food court at Monroeville Mall!",Dawn of the Dead
365,sarastrahan-61184,Different Type of Movie Than the Original,7,16 October 2021,Anyone hoping for a film as deep and filling as George Romero's original zombie classic will go to bed hungry after witnessing Zach Snyder's remake which replaces commentary for non-stop action.He's assembled a strong cast and crew to bring his vision to life and it works if you're in it for the action and gore over anything more meaningful. It's a fun movie and the perfect kind of movie to play in the background at a Halloween party. The effects are fantastic despite some corny CGI moments.,Dawn of the Dead

I would have been happier with a supernatural curse type of scenario than believe dead bodies, lacking any metabolism, and literally decomposing down to mush in 48 hours (like a good dead body will). If you are going to pursue the virus route, try, try, try, to make the movie enjoyable for those clods like me that can't help thinking, ""how can they run so damn fast"". It doesn't have to be a huge explanation, just make a pass at it.2) Enough with the stereotypes. Every character was like a B-movie doll they pulled from the shelf.3) Although people here have said it a lot... The girl risking her life for a DOG (especially after they made the point to demonstrate that dogs don't attack deads and visa versa) almost completely ruined the movie for me. I was groaning and checking my watch when that happened...4) Non-believable character reactions:4a) Why would the security guards hate to see more help arrive? 4b) Why would the ""good guy character"" go it alone with a crow bar after knowing how dangerous the deads are? 4c) The cop would have never given up his gun to the guard. 4d) No one checked on the pregnant girl at all?!? Not even the nurse?!? 4e) How can ANDY not have killed 1,000 deads if that's all he had to do? How could he not have killed enough of them to chance a truck ride over (especially since he had a ton of guns and ammo?!??!) C'mon, first order of business would have been to load up. 4f) Once you reach and secure a MALL, how do you not spend the summer there while watching what happens to the deads... Too much food and security for them?!?! 4g) What on earth did the yuppie guy have to gain by leaving them in the sewer? If he was as self possessed as the film wanted us to believe, he would have had a self serving motive to see them succeed... 4h) Why in the world was he carrying keys to his boat on the float chain in his SUIT pocket?!?!?I admit, I had to take a two to three minute bio-break during the movie, so if all there questions were answered then, pardon my post!Chip",Dawn of the Dead

368,Jadey97,"Definitely ""re-imaged"" but a great ""remake""",9,26 March 2004,"I enjoyed this more than the original DOTD. My major gripes about this movie were the plotholes, the lack of character development (most of the time you had many characters you could care less about), and the running zombies. It just doesn't make sense. HOW do the dead RUN??? Instead of overanalyzing it, I sat back and enjoyed it on opening day. There were some humorous scenes (the infamous celebrity-look-alike zombie shooting spree scene, uhh hello, that did NOT look like Burt Reynolds!) and even scenes that made me cry- namely the scene between Lindy Booth & Matt Frewer (you'll know what I'm talking about if you saw it) and the part where Andy holds up the sign that says ""Hungry"" and you could see his ribs. Pathetic I know. I never thought *I* would cry at a horror movie. In any case, the Richard Cheese version of ""Down With The Sickness"" was hilarious and a great cover, it wasn't as gory as the original but it was good. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. I plan on going again.I give it a 9/10.",Dawn of the Dead
369,mitchelledwards,Wows With The Action,7,15 June 2009,"I love the horror films of the 60's and 70's and the original George Romero zombie flicks are still some of my favorites but being that this is a re imagining I will try to stay away from comparisons. Okay the plot is very simple (even for a horror film) there is a deadly virus that has broken out over most of the U.S. that causes the victims to come back to life. So a band of survivors decide to take refuge in an abandoned shopping mall, I think that first and foremost this movie should be classified as an action film and not horror because there is plenty of ammo being shot and plenty of things exploding but not enough scares. Also things like character development are sorely lacking. The actors did a good job with the roles and the direction by Zah Snyder (Watchmen and 300) was good but as a die hard fan of the genre I can't call this a horror film.",Dawn of the Dead
370,producer-3,Excellent action for the Zombie fan.,10,25 March 2004,"I think the Original Dawn of the Dead (1979) is the best horror movie ever, when I heard of this movie coming out, I was scared they might damage the original.  However, I was excited that another Zombie flick was coming out and I threw away all expectations before seeing the film.  This new version is superb.It contains a lot of violence, and is probably one of the scariest movies ever made.  I would not compare this to the original because it is taken from a different point of view.  Any real Zombie fan must take this into consideration or your will ruin a great movie.  These Zombies are more vicious, faster, and smarter.This movie is extremely fast paced, which makes character development weak, but that is not why you would want to see this movie at the theaters.  The acting is performed well with the brief time each character has to present themselves.  Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley do an excellent job also with their allotted time.The Soundtrack is superlative for this movie.  The editing was good with a large amount of assemble edits that work really well through out the movie.",Dawn of the Dead
371,TomPaine-3,"Very good, but not iconic",8,28 March 2004,"*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*I had low hopes for this film, considering that the original Dawn of the Dead is my favourite horror. I was rather pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying this.Where it differs for the original is that it lacks that movies political angle on consumerism and greed. In that movie the zombies go to the mall because it was something they used to do. In this version they go to the mall to eat people. And that's it. No political motivation or satire on American consumer culture. Let's call this re-make (or re-imagining) a zombie movie for the MTV generation.Thats not to say the re-make has its faults. With the exception of Michael or Kenneth there is really is no sympathetic character to latch onto - most seem to fall into one-dimensional stereotypes such Steve the selfish one or Andre the street punk who is finally wiseing up to responsibilities. I could not really handle Ana at all - what was the point of her character? I figure she was there to have someone the audience could identify with - the average person who is caught up with something way beyond their control. However her behaviour seems odd. She seems to figure out what's happening and then going all gooey and showing reluctance to use that knowledge for the benefit of the group? Huh? And what exactly was that ending about? Shades of Cannibal Holocaust here with the filming of the fate(?) of the final survivors. Personally I would have left a more enigmatic ending with the final fadeout of them going to a destination unknown.Still what's the point of carping about what is a very good and entertaining film. It may lack the human frailties of the original and the iconic zombie figure. I suppose that's the message - when we become a zombie no one stands out.8 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
372,cousinoleg,"Ignore the gore and violence, the meaning is easier to understand by the words of Lord Jesus Christ",5,18 September 2013,"In the past i liked movies like this one, where a group of characters try to escape some threat, but slowly die one by one, with only a few more righteous/better characters remain alive by the end.But i didn't understand the rules of reward and punishment, because of being brought up in an unbelieving family, and my sense of truth and goodness was subjective.This zombie movie was repeated so much on TV, with some interesting Christian allusions, so i decided to analyze it according to Christian faith.Thankfully to God, later in life i was lead to believe in His Son Jesus Christ, to become a Christian. It's the words of Jesus Christ, that shed light on what actions are good and true, and what are evil and false.Jesus Chris concentrated the whole Bible (law and prophets) in two greatest commandments: love God with your whole being, and love our neighbors, by treating them the way you want to be treated.Zombies, are a metaphor, easy to to uncover by Jesus' words, for the spiritually dead (Luke 9:60)(John 8:24) by sin.The movie's Christian influence is observed by its showing of a Christian TV program condemning the country for immorality, abortions and other sins.A couple of survivors lock themselves in a mall for food and protection, away from zombies. They are treated with hostility and are quarantined by former guards, led by CJ. God will do a similar thing on the Judgement Day, the saints and true Christians will enter Heaven, but the rest, wicked unrepentant sinners will be thrown into the burning lake to keep the Kingdom of Heaven, unpolluted by sin and free from pain and sorrow. Many people hate God for this judgment as being loveless, but what are they going to do in the place of these zombie movie characters; are you going to love zombies, but put the rest of people under danger of infection? or are you going to destroy them and throw them out to keep the rest of people alive and uninfected?After more wounded survivors come into the mall, the problem becomes more serious, when parents and loved ones are the ones who are infected. Jesus Christ told that if you love your parents and close ones more than Him, then you are not worthy of Him, and that you must hate your close ones and your own life to be His disciple (Matthew 10:37) (Luke 14:26). These verses anger many ""atheists"" too. But here's a spiritual illustration of these verses in the movie - a pregnant woman was infected, and also the father of a newcomer girl is bitten too. Are you gonna love them even when they turn into zombies? Or are you going to destroy them once they are undead and dangerous? Otherwise it leads to more deaths, as a criminal character Andre and an old woman, murder each other, after she shoots his now-undead wife. There was some strange accent by slow motion on this woman's smoking habit; for hints read (1 Corinthians 3:16) - does smoking glorify God or does it harm our bodies?It's better to follow Jesus Christ into eternal life and salvation, than to keep hanging with the close ones who refuse to believe and repent and follow them into destruction of souls in hellfire.From then on, by using Jesus' words it's easy to predict who's going to die and/or turn into zombie. By Jesus' and God's words, and the actions of some of the movie's characters, we find the following sins: homosexuality, arrogance, lack of love and care, sexual immorality, cruelty. God tells that sin leads to death. Indeed these characters did die next. The others that have some faith in God, and who take care of others (christian love), do survive.It's basically a demonstration of usefulness and good practice of Jesus' words in a zombie movie. So let's thank Jesus Christ and God for His good example, wisdom and teaching.Later CJ, sacrifices himself by blowing up a gas bomb after being cornered and bit by a zombie crowd. According to the Bible Jesus Christ has died on the cross, as a permanent sacrifice for our sins, to save us from spiritual death by sin. His reverse initials are CJ(Christ Jesus). Was CJ's initials and self-sacrifice to save the rest of the group a nod to Jesus' sacrifice? Might be.Also there's some attempt at drama, to reveal that a character, who was romantically linked to a caring female character, was bitten. Did he sin in some way? I don't remember. Of course, they need to separate.CONCLUSION: The violent action and gore can heavily distract from the meaning of the story, and is unsuitable for children and nervous people.For others, the Christian influences of the story make it somewhat interesting in demonstrating the meaning, necessity and practical usefulness of some of Jesus Christ's teachings, though it should not be treated literally, but spiritually. After all there are no literal zombies in this world, so there's no literal fight - but there's a spiritual one against lies of Satan and unbelievers, by the use of the Word of God, in the Bible.So throw away your guns and weapons and leave your dreams of being a hero in a zombie apocalypse, but better read the Bible, starting with New Testament for beginners, so that your soul will be saved by Jesus Christ, and you won't share the burning lake punishment with unrepentant wicked sinners.",Dawn of the Dead

This is an improvement over doing a scene-by-scene remake as was done for the original Night of the Living Dead. I am pleased that the producers decided to add their own interpretation of the genre.Judged on its own merits this is destined to become a classic ""Dead"" movie. The Romero movies are classics, especially the first because nothing like it had ever been done before but the action, direction, make-up, and special effects of this (re-)incarnation make this film a must see. The Romero series is looking rather dated and low budget compared to what can be accomplished with the special effects these days. Do special effects and a bigger budget make a good film? Just refer to the most recent Star Wars films and you'll see that that is not the case.I won't bother with the plot because, let's face it, these movies are about putting ordinary people into extraordinary situations and seeing how they respond. In that context it is easy to understand their appeal. How would you react? Would you just give up and accept your fait, would you fight back or perhaps fight your potential allies for control? This movie covers those aspects similar to how the Romero films covered them, with intelligence and insight into the human character.The bottom line is if you are a fan of the Dead movies than it is worthwhile to see this in the theatre. The production values are good, the action is good, the suspense was a little lacking but overall this is one for my (Dead) dvd collection.",Dawn of the Dead

This is one of those few exceptions as Zack Snyder manages to stay faithful to the original while putting a few of his own ideas into the mix. When Fort Pastor, Milwaukee is hit with a vast spreading virus the majority of the population are converted into zombies. A group of survivors are forced to take refuge in a shopping mall. The film is let down by providing us with too many characters but some merely make up the numbers and don't get much screen time. A stand out performance comes from Ving Rhames who plays Kenneth, a cop mad with authority but has a good heart and Sarah Polley who plays Ana, a nurse whose a tough women under the circumstances. Snyder makes you really care about these characters, including a dog called chips. Just to up the game a bit Snyder's zombies can run. It makes you wonder how this move might affect the way zombies are portrayed in the future. There is much gore but it is not used to often and relies on the story as much as the action. The suspense is just as thrilling as some of the attacks. Snyder's Dawn of he Dead can sit along side the original without shame and has the potential to be the start of a franchise.",Dawn of the Dead
377,Aidonian,it grows on you,4,27 July 2005,"Being a fan of the original Dawn, I have to admit that when I saw this movie, it wasn't that bad. After seeing the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, I knew remakes these days suck big time and here it was no different. Than again, what can you expect from a guy who along his major screen credits is Scooby Doo. When the movie starts, the plague is already starting, but only the next morning we get to see the bubble burst and have the zombies attack every living human being. As a fan of zombie movies, I was disappointed with the low level of gore here, although hinting at it is fine. But this is a zombie movie, and in it we need to see more gore than there we could see. After the first 15 minutes, the movie starts to weaken. What they have build up in the first 15 minutes, they lose afterwords. The characters were believable, but the zombies aren't. If you think how long it takes for rigor mortis to kick in, how come after 2 weeks, these zombies could still run like in the beginning. It made no sense. Of course zombie movies usually don't make sense, but there is still a kind of rationality to it, that we don't see here. I might add that the first 15 minutes of the movie had me shaken in my boots sorth of speak, but the rest of the movie didn't until they leave the mall. Hell, the news program we can view on the DVD of this film is scarier than the entire movie combined and it only lasts about 20 minutes. Judge it yourself as you watch the movie.",Dawn of the Dead
378,MaybeTomorrow,Excellent!,9,24 December 2004,"2 thumbs up!!I Really love this remake of George A. Romero's horror-classic. While we should never forget what Romero created, i do prefer this movie instead of the classic. Everything in this film is better. The zombies, the makeup, the scares, the actors. Zack Snyder really delived a modern re-telling of this classic story. With his great visual style and well timed scares, Snyder re-animated (pun intended) the zombiegenre. A nice treat to horrorveterans is the return of the original cast. The 3 leadactors of the classic have small appearances in this film. Extra titbit: i enjoyed the small intro from the director on the DVD.This movie SCREAMS for a sequel. I sure as hell would love to see one.9/10",Dawn of the Dead

I found some parts to be suspenseful and creepy and other parts to be funny and comical especially if you see or watched the directors cut. I liked the characters and it didn't really copy the original in the same way and i liked it because it was different. I mean originally the movie was rated NC-17 because of the further inappropriate material in the movie, but then they cut it down, and some of that material is in the directors cut. I mean the director really showed his skills, and i mean the movie was taken totally seriously, but i mean it was better then i thought it was going to be, so good job!

If you're looking for a slick, glossy and gory zombie film you'll be pleased. Actually, younger audiences and people who haven't seen the original DOTD might like the film more. The intro (first 10 minutes or so) and end credits sequences are both brilliant and make the film worth watching all by itself.I guess my big criticism is that the DOTD remake should've been a stand-alone film because it has almost NOTHING to do with the original, other than zombies the mall setting. Except the zombies in the first film were slow, lumbering and relentless. The zombies in this film are fast, rabid, and quite derivative of 20 Days Later. The mall setting in the first film was used to satirize consumer culture. The mall in this version of DOTD is just a setting - the characters in this film could have holed up anywhere, because the remake complete eliminates all of the subtext of the first film.Some good gore, a few scares and the most inspired intro and end credits I've seen in a horror film in a while, but whereas the original DOTD was funny and smart in addition to being horrifying, this version is slick, shallow and has nothing to say.",Dawn of the Dead

Bad acting, terrible script (which does try to pull a few lines from the '78 version as justification), I honestly can't find a good thing to say about it.A waste of time to try and remake it (can't believe it actually made money), and a complete waste of time in trying to watch this version.It really is bad.If you played it in a mortuary, I wouldn't be surprised if someone actually unzipped themselves, shuffled over and turned it off.",Dawn of the Dead

385,zor_prime,DOTD and Zombie Theory (not really a spoiler),9,29 November 2005,"Not really any big or important spoilers in this article...As a big fan of zombie movies (for some strange reason, I am somewhat senselessly entranced by zombie theory), I would have to say that this is one of the finer zombie films I've ever seen. Although some viewers might call it campy or spoofy even (due to some of the very well-placed comic relief), I believe it was a great effort on the part of Zack Snyder (never heard of Zack Snyder before this movie?--me neither). Some of the DVD extras are a testament to the attention-to-detail that was given to this treatment of the old Romero flick.Plot: The plot is roughly based on the original Romero film (so I won't elaborate much here), but it has a pretty hard edge (not to mention improved zombie theory). The story follows survivors in a Wisconsin burb (yeah, it's a REAL Wisconsin Death Trip!) that's suddenly ravaged by zombie hordes. Note: If you watch the extra materials, you find that the incident happens on a global scale. Incidentally, the production company seems to be called ""Strike"", but the first few times I watched the movie, I wondered if the word ""Strike"" being shown in the opening sequence was significant of the incident(s) being an intentional terrorist ""strike"". My guess now is not, but I wondered if anyone else thought that.Characters: The characters are believable (all but the kid in the begging sequence). I mean, who doesn't like a Ving Rhames joint? I think the other relatively unknown actors do a pretty great job, too. Not-to-mention the zombies: The thought that went into creating anatomically correct zombies at various stages of decomposition was apparently immense. I especially liked the Andy character, a personality close to my heart, in a situation like that ;) Interesting features: I was excited to see that this treatment incorporated the 'fast-moving' zombie mobility. 28 Days Later was (to my knowledge) the first realistic movie to theorize that zombies could be more than lumbering sub-human blobs. The idea that your first encounter with a situation like this would give you very little reaction time, is pretty scary to think about (if you allow yourself a little right-brain indulgence to really imagine it). In contrast, I'd have to say slow-moving blobs would be much easier to deal with. Which scenario (slow-movers vs. fast-movers) might be closer to a realistic possibility? You'd have to read my Zombie Theory to find out what I think (coming soon). I enjoyed the placement and appropriateness of both versions of Disturbed's Down With the Sickness.Negative/detracting features: The girl in the opening scenes (her locomotion and biting 'bit' seemed a little cartoonish. The zombie birthing/baby scene was unnecessarily stupid (reminiscent of a Chucky movie--blech). The head and spinal column still 'alive' in the fishing boat's cooler. I didn't like what happened in the very end scenes (embedded in the credits--you missed it if you left the theater early). The ending before that would have been fine, IMO.In conclusion, I am a big fan of this production of Romero's Dawn of the Dead. I honestly feel that this film would have been much better received by audiences had it not been a ""remake"". It would have been going a little further out on a limb, but what went into this film could have produced an extremely good original movie. I guess Zack Snyder (or someone at Strike, etc.) had to make the decision early on to go with a ""remake"" for the famesake/namesake, or something potentially better (or at least as good) that would be original and not connected to the Romero film. I enjoyed the film in the theater and at home, and it is a thought-provoking inspiration to my Zombie Theory.",Dawn of the Dead
386,stavka,Brilliant Redux - wished I had a few more bites,9,20 March 2004,"And now, a clinical dissection of many critic's most common beefs with this film.These Zombies are fast  That also makes them scary; a Romeroesque zombie poses little threat to anybody with a sledgehammer, and actually might be fun to deal with if you've got a twelve gauge, .o6, etc and a good back-up man. Don't believe me?  Watch `Night' or `Dawn', the characters themselves are laughing it up in multiple sequences. That slow zombies could overwhelm the combined might of America's hunters, police, military, and tool sheds never made any real sense. I dare you to tell me different.I miss the `subtle attack on American consumerism!'  well rub the sleep out of your eyes and put away your Movie Guide books; first and foremost it wasn't that subtle, it wasn't really even that clever given that 75% of the original dawn took place in a mall. What were they suppose to allude to, the vast wasted space that are America's parking lots? Besides its been replaced successfully with a reinforcement of iron class structure  but I won't bore you with a neo-Marxist rant, you can connect those dots.This wasn't anywhere near as scary as the original Did you even see the original? Sure it was gory, but scary? What part of the pie fight was the scariest for you?Too many characters and no development  Well again, just tell me the top three things that pop into your mind about the original fab four. Not to knock the original script, but characterization was not its strong suit, the characters were nearly interchangeable. Here we get to see a true spectrum of human reaction to overwhelming tragedy. I felt for these characters, I could write a mini bio for each of them  compared to the original, I could say Roger was the white cop, what else could you add? In short, I found this a brilliant and captivating re-visioning and hope it leads to additional films for the series. It was creepy and technically well executed. I only wish it was longer, several non-action scenes I suspect ended up on the cutting room floor. e.g. CJ gets let out of holding cell, Frank's degenerationWell done8/10 overall, 10/10 for Zombie horror",Dawn of the Dead
387,SmashMonkey,get down with the sickness,10,15 August 2006,"when i heard that dawn of the dead was being remade, the first thing i thought was: philistines! how could anybody mess with such a classic? then i watched it. oh. my. god. this film kicks undead ass! it will never truly live up to the original, but it's so good that it doesn't have to. this stands on its own two decomposing feet as a cinematic triumph. i have been let down so often by horror films in recent years that i was expecting to feel completely underwhelmed by the new dawn. instead, i sat entranced with a grin on my face so wide that it was threatening to decapitate me. from the moment Vivienne the neighbour girl gave the heroine a very rude awakening, i knew that this wasn't going to be your average shambling zombie flick. child zombies would have been frowned upon until very recently and as for fast zombies, at last! older films have a certain Pepe le pew-like quality, with the poor victims running for their lives while the zombies move about as quickly as the average post office queue, yet still manage to catch them. i was delighted to see so many references to the original, including a couple of cast members being resurrected. the news reports on the DVD edition gave the film a much more realistic feel, plus some decent back-plot. the characters were believable and well-rounded, with the possible exception of luda (did she annoy anyone else or was that just me?). scenes such as the zombie version of celebrity squares lightened the tone of the film, balancing nicely with the harshness of the birth scenes. there is more to recommend this film than i could possibly mention here. it's an instant classic, worthy of the great George Romero himself. the director's cut is a must for true fans, Andy's tape is pure gold, a marvellous account of a solitary man's descent into despair and mild insanity. that alone is reason enough to buy this film. if you haven't already seen it, do it now, don't wait till you're undead!",Dawn of the Dead

389,ajmayowski,"A totally different animal from Romero; as in, a fast, relentless one.",10,19 March 2004,"I just got back, and I'd like to share one bit of information before I elaborate.Horror movies don't scare me. I nearly peed myself.Now, as I was saying, this is nothing like the original version. More or less, this movie feels like it's done by the people who made 28 Days Later, and the artists for Resident Evil. I've seen the same type of zombies in Resident Evil, hell, in the instruction booklet.What this movie adds to the table that 28 Days Later didn't is fairly obvious; It shows you an undead creature that can run like William Perry with a rocket on his back; This means fast, and hard hitting.It's a growing trend that we see fast zombies, and I can understand this, as the creatures need to evolve; to become scarier. But while it will be hard for some of us, who still remember the slow zombie, newer audiences will eat it up. Isn't it odd, knowing that one day zombies will be thought of as fast?BACK TO THE MOVIE...This movie really had to do something special to rise above 28 Days Later, so as to not be a clone, and it succeeded here. It's not Dawn of the Dead (78) and it's not Resident Evil. It's its own movie, and it shows as a hard working, scare a minute thrill.Action and Horror: Two genres, always so close, yet never meshing perfectly. What DOTD has here is the end of conventional horror; The Age of Slashers is at its end. Now, Horror movies will be faster, scarier (hopefully), and maybe even less gory. DOTD took a huge step back from the original, not a head twisted off in sight.So, while this was definantly the best horror movie made since Nightmare on Elm Street, it also kills off the slasher genre. Unless, of course, they evolve too, which Freddy vs. Jason showed signs of.Time's running out. The Slasher genre has to save itself.By the way...10/10 Horror. Perfectly made, but uncomparable to the original. Watch for future movies to copy this flick.",Dawn of the Dead

I think it stands quite well, certainly superior to Romero's 2005 Land of the Dead. The ending credits were kind of silly, reminiscent of Resident Evil/music video outtakes, but otherwise this wasn't a bad movie. The acting was fine, the directing sharp, and the zombies were kind of scary. A few so-so scenes like the zombie baby, which was done far better in 1985's Dead End, but as far as pointless remakes go, this was a good one. The @sshole security guard is great; at first he's a rehash of Joe Polato's un-praiseworthy performance in 1985's Day of the Dead, then he does a complete turnaround, ultimately saving the day.

I went to see Dawn of the Dead on opening weekend and whoa I had an awesome time.Dawn of the Dead is not just a good remake ..it is a good zombie film in general. 28 Days Later basically kicked started the zombie genre again in 2003 and in a sense helped this movie get green lighted. It shows that the zombie genre is in full force because Dawn of the Dead 2004 does not disappoint. The director Zack Snyder really knew what we wanted. He did not just do a remake and carbon copied the original. He made the film stand out on its own and one of the thing he added was fast moving zombies. In my opinion it worked and made the film intense.The movie waste no time getting to the blood and gore. Within the first 10 minutes we are treated to an intense zombie opening followed by one of the best opening credits ever. What better way to start off this bloody film than with Johnny Cash? We have some cool actors in this movie like Ving and Sarah and some actors who I have never heard of that are good in this movie. But Ving owns this movie.Lastly, when the end credits roll. Do not turn it off. The movie continues through the credits. The movie gets 10/10 not because it is the best movie I ever seen but because the movie worked on so many levels and that is surprising for a remake.",Dawn of the Dead

But hey, i found myself down the local VUE cinema, checking in to see the 2004 version of George E Romero's 1978 original, Dawn Of The Dead. What mainly appealed about this movie was the high calibre cast. Sarah Polley is distinguishable for her somewhat eclectic choices when it comes to picking movie roles. The last film i saw her in was Doug LIman's 1999 film, Go and if both films are anything to go by, she has a good eye for good scripts. I dont want to spoil too much but the basic plot involves zombies taking over a neighbourhood and a group of locals trapped in a mall trying not to be picked off one by one! I have to admit, i have yet to see the orginal but maybe that enables me to provide an objective opinion on this remake without making unnecessary comparisons to the original. As it stands on its own, thsi film is am enjoyable, yet gory, horror film. The acting is of a standard you would expect form a high calibre cast including Polley, Ving Rhames and Mekhi Pfiffer. The storyline is simple yet effective and is reminiscent of the 70s action films where you have a group of strangers united in a building formwhich the yhave to escape. It is not as relentlessly horrific as the texas chainsaw massacre remake..Some comedic moments are entwined, the best being the jay leno /burt reynolds zombies!!
Definitely watch this film if yo uare a fan of horror remakes.. Don't go in comparing this to the original, let it stand alone as a film in its own right. Post success of 28 Days Later and Dog SOldiers, it was surely only a matter of time for this zombie classic to be remade!Anyway, 8/10!! That is my final word!",Dawn of the Dead

The basic plot is the same - the world has been taken over by flesh-eating zombies, and a small group of survivors hole up in a suburban shopping mall.The main difference with the original is the zombies themselves. No longer the slow, stumbling creatures that were easily out-run, these new 21st Century monsters run. And boy, do they run quick! I shan't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but do yourselves a favour - don't compare this to the original.

396,Guo_Jing,A terrific movie.,9,5 April 2010,"Death. A common fear amongst almost all the civilizations in the world. But what if you could overcome death? Would you do it? What if, in order to overcome death, you were reduced to a brainless automaton? You get bit. You bleed to death. You come back. That is the premise of this film. However, when you come back, there is nothing left of you but your body; your mind is all but gone - wasted. There is a stark difference between vampires and zombies - vampires are sentient, zombies are not. That fact makes them all the more terrifying. Similar to the original, the few survivors take refuge in a mall (an allusion to consumerism in modern society, perhaps?). Across the river of zombies trying to bite the survivors is a gun store, owned by Andy. Neither of them can reach each other, so they use a dry-erase-board to communicate. They play a game: the people in the mall write down the name of a celebrity, such as Burt Reynolds. Andy then shoots the zombie-look-a-like in the head. A classic scene.The film also poses the belief: the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. A man was bit, he is slowly dying and shall eventually turn into a zombie. What do you do? Do you kill him right away, or do you let him die then resurrect as a zombie? At which point is a human beyond hope?Morality and philosophy intermixed with horror and zombie fun.

But it gets kind of boring as they camp out there for about 75% of the movie without anything really happening. However, the movie becomes exciting when they build the buses and at the rescue-scene at the gun shop. This is spectacular made! :) It's also nice when they drive off to the docks, but here the movie takes a turn down into total flop...Sorry to say that. As the survivors are just ready to take off with the boat, two of the main characters have to be abandoned (maybe they felt like it, I don't know, especially CJ) and Michael coincidentally has been infected. The last thing you hear is a gun shot by Michael shooting himself and in the credits (as a torture against the audience) we have to follow the end titles because you can see short clips from a handhold camera showing how they discover an island...WITH ZOMBIES ON IT! Camera drops down. WHAT?! Did they die? We don't know. Too confusing ending. I think they could have moved the action a bit forward so they would have used like 15 % of the screen time in the mall, then build the buses and then the movie could have been about how they drive around to find a safe place. That would have worked a lot better in my opinion. So ... Ending is bad. Action takes too much place in the mall. But the start and set up is actually quite good. 4 stars.",Dawn of the Dead
398,guru_monk,"""Updated"" in more ways than one",1,14 August 2005,"George Romero's original ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a classic, hands down. It is a fine, thoughtful movie. The characters are carefully meshed out and developed over the course of the narrative, beyond that, Romero's dramatic decisions make sense, he only uses four main characters to propel his story. The remake, on the other hand (one can only hope that Romero made some money from this, which would be the only justification), is a stock 00s Hollywood product: utterly soulless and moronic from the first frame to the last. The characters are stereotypes and at times bizarre (armed security guards in a mall?), the action perfunctory and essentially pornographic in its lack of relation to the story itself. The screenwriter decides to toss in some smarmy, obnoxious characters straight out of a bad 1980s teen sex romp. Annoying, smart ass yuppie? Check. Hard ass rent a cop security guards/morons? Check. Useless characters who stand around for ten minutes acting surprised that the zombies that have been attacking them for the last few days are, in fact, attacking once again? Check. Characters are uniformly good shots (none of the tension in the first film from SWAT members vs. the macho but inexperienced helicopter pilot) able to adjust their aim and ""shoot 'em in the head"". In the first film the characters planned and executed schemes to the best of their abilities, in this one a bunch of idiots run around like headless chickens flailing about wildly from one ill conceived plan to another. Thank you again, Hollywood, for doing your part to spoil a movie for young movie goers who will now make no attempt to see the original, since this remake is so ""totally awesome 'cause like a zombie like gets totally stabbed in the head"".

One of the best zombie movies I've ever seen with the added impact of zombies relentlessly chasing down their victims at full speed quite unlike other flicks in this sub-genre! One of the few remakes that out-shines the original in my opinion. The Negatives: Some acting flaws including Ving Rhames portrayal of police man Kenneth being a tad too heartless to begin with and the lead 2 characters, the nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) and TV salesman Michael (Jake Weber), are somewhat annoying at times but each character grows on you as the movie progresses. The Positives: So many to list but the use of a mall and nearby gun shop provides an excellent setting.

Good contact lenses good acting good cast in fact it was just good.I don't have much else to say besides I take my hat off to the makeup artist who did an incredible jobThough I have one criticism, I don't know if it was just the version I saw, whether it was cut heavily by the sensors though it said directors cut on the cover here in New Zealand. But there weren't many zombies in the film especially compared to the hoards of them in the first one of the same name. Though then again the only resemblance this film bears to the first is it's name and cameo appearances by members of the first movie.I was good, could have been better but was still a scary little number which I watched three times and intend to watch again. I own a copy on DVD. But I will recommend one thing to those who haven't seen it yet. I saw it first on a small 21 inch screen flat screen that is, TV with Nicam sounds on Video tape. Then again on DVD same TV sounded and looked like crap. Due to it's size you miss many aspects of the film if you watch it from a normal distance so either make sure you watch it up closer, or watch it on a big screen TV if you have access to one or build a homemade TV projector from one of the many do it yourself 100"" TV projector sites around. Don't pay for the plans they are available for free for best results use a magnifying glass not a Fresnel lens make sure it doesn't have a bi focal bit though. And spray a piece of MDF board with semi gloss silver paint to get a good picture anyway I used a new 32 widescreen T.V and incredible surround functions on it and OMG what I had been missing and not just on that film but many others.Good film wouldn't mind seeing another zombie movie from the same producers of this",Dawn of the Dead
401,AvonKerr,Why?,2,25 November 2004,"In brief : It would have been an average zombie movie if it hadn't tried to connect itself to Romero. By doing that though it set it's standards miles too high and never came anywhere near them. If it had a different name and had dropped 2 or 3 stolen lines it would have been a 4 or maybe a 5/10. By reminding the viewer of better films though it rates at best a 3.Direction : Lazy best describes it. Zombie movies are not a genre big on story so to make a good one you need to make the world and it's characters really come alive. Snyder does OK with some of the characters but fails to do anything with most. Too many things happen without reason or purpose and he could have done with a few less survivors inside the mall.Cinematography/Editing - Amateurish and very annoying. Most scenes fell into two categories - ""ooh look at my new camera's zoom lens"" or ""I liked this shot in [other movie] I'll just steal that"". The two worst examples of the latter are the American Beauty ""look closer"" teaser shot used at the beginning and the 28 Days Later stutter shots used at the end. The AB one just ruined any attempt to build tension and the 28 Days Later rip-off totally missed the point. In that film it was used for scenes featuring the ""infected"" to differentiate their chaotic nature from that of the normal people. In this film it was just stuck over the last ten minutes because someone thought ""me likee, me steal"". Without context it was just annoying and cheap.Acting/Characters - The primaries were generally good and one or two were very good. Unfortunately there were a few that just got ignored and even the best ones were tainted at some point. For example - Ana and Michael - what on Earth was that about? I'll tell you what - some suit demanded a romance regardless of context or reason. Another example, the guards - they started out great and could have added a lot more substance to the film but instead everyone had to get along and ""bond"". Again I assume someone didn't like the idea of a film containing any kind of social commentary or depth. The gun-shop guy was a really nice idea, I wish they had used him a lot more and only had one or two people arrive in the truck. The couple with the baby are the best thing in the film, hands down. In fact they are the only thing that is in any small way worthy of the films claimed heritage.Gore/SFX - Not enough of it basically and nothing new or interesting.Plot - As I said above zombie movies aren't big here but this one had none, zero, zip. nada, not a bean. Nothing drove it on at all and consecutive scenes rarely connected at all after the first half hour. There is no sense of time passing in the film at all, they could have been there a week or a year but there's no way at all to tell. The passage of time and it's effect on the cast is central to the original but totally missing here.CHUDs - Adequate for the task but nothing special. Their behaviour and abilities are rather inconsistent but not so much as to be a major annoyance. The makeup required is now run-off-the-mill so it's hard to say much but that it was up to the job. I didn't like the way they ran - running is not so bad on it's own but they were just too co-ordinated by far. If they had stumbled more or something they would have looked a lot better. Biggest complaint I had here though was that there was nowhere near enough moaning and groaning.The Romero connection - I have no idea why they bothered. With the title changed and a few lines removed the only link would have been the mall and they could have just about got away with that. When compared to the original this film loses in every single way, including those where technological advances could have made it better. Almost all the things that mark the original out as a masterpiece are completely absent here and nothing is added to replace them.",Dawn of the Dead
402,Danielramos16,A horror Masterpiece that equals the original,10,20 June 2008,"This is the age of the Remake. I don't know exactly when it started but remaking a classic movie seems to be the hip trend in Hollywood these days. Tragically most of the remakes have sucked royally, some even stain the legacy of the originals. Dawn of the dead (2004) is a fine example of how to do a kick ass remake! Not only do we have a good remake of a classic horror film, but we have a horror classic in it's own right. I saw an interview with the director Zach Snyder who said something I thought was brilliant about doing the Dawn of the dead remake; ""The Original is a classic, so I didn't want to do anything to step on the toes of that, so we took the basic premise of a bunch of people holed up in a mall during a zombie apocalypse and wrote a story around that"". I thought that was very smart & thoughtful cause what he ended up doing was taking the concepts from the original and making a movie that would stand on it's own feet, and not be seen as something that was trying to imitate the original.I think this is arguably the best zombie movie ever made, because for once we finally see a zombie movie that shows the horror of a zombie apocalypse from the very beginning. The very first few minutes of the movie are great because it seems like just another day, but you can see the unsettling signs that something bad is about to happen. You really feel like this is the calm before the storm, then suddenly all F*****g hell breaks loose! The little girl walking into the bed room all messed up is so shocking. The action grabs you by the throat, the suspense doesn't let up, there is always a sense of terror around the corner. What also gets me is the humor, there are moments that are really funny. When the characters say something humorous you really do laugh cause it just comes across as so casual and like something that my friends would say. The characters came across as real people, They all gave pretty convincing & genuine performances.What make this film so bad ass are the zombies. I know purists insist that slow moving zombies are better and more realistic, put that's so traditional & normal from every classic zombie film. This movie has Zombies that are fast! Snyder described it perfectly, when the zombies see food they go after it! their like wild carnivorous animals and that makes this film so scary. Face it, slow zombies are weak and you can get away from them, hell you could take on three of them with no problem. But you couldn't get away or take on the zombies in this film. They also looked very realistic, they looked dead, look at the Dawn of the dead special feature where they explain how they did the zombie make up. The make-up for the zombies was magnificent and intelligently thought out.As amazing and as hard to believe as it sounds, Dawn of the Dead (2004) stands side by side with Dawn of the dead (1978) as classic horror films. As revolutionary & classic the original was to it's era, this remake does the same with our generation. I left the theater thinking ""Now that's how you make a Zombie movie""",Dawn of the Dead
403,ca_dale,Unique enough to be watched and enjoyed on its own merit,7,24 July 2007,"Dawn of the Dead follows the same basic plot as George Romero's 1978 original. The dead are coming back to life to prey on the living. Amid the chaos a small miss-matched group of survivors escape to a shopping mall and use the building as a last line of defense against the swarms of zombies closing in on them. However, beyond this basic back bone the two films are markedly different in how they play out.This new film puts the emphasis on gore and action to drive its momentum. Contrast this with the original which stressed suspense much more effectively. The cast is also much larger than that of the original and as you'd imagine this gives considerably more fodder for elaborate death scenes. Unfortunately character development has been sacrificed considerably with only a few spouting enough personality for us to care much about them. Gone as well is the original's often scathing social commentary into consumerism and societal apathy. The new film also manages to be surprisingly humorous at times. The bit where Andy is shooting zombies from the rooftop who resemble celebrities is priceless.So is the remake as good as the original? No, but it offers enough new elements to merit its existence unlike the bulk of shallow ill-conceived remakes we've had to deal with lately. Give it shot.",Dawn of the Dead
404,marallu82,A could-be-good remake,2,20 March 2007,"I have to admit that the old Dawn of the dead is for me the best zombie film ever, good and simple script, unknown actors, total chaos... but here i review the 2004 film. First i'd say i don't like fast moving zombies at all, zombie's charm is in the slowness, it makes them so scary. The mayor flaw of the remake (besides the zombie baby!?! which was so unfortunate) is in the script of course, the characters never admit that they could end up living inside the mall, like they did in the 70's film where they made at home inside, and in the end were the humans who f4ck them up. Here script writers came up with a stupid salvation convoy and a more senseless boat scape, a ""made in Hollywood"" ending. Zombie movies are doomed because is the way they should end up. This genre admits no innovation, we don't need explanation for the undead awakening, no zombie character development (did i said that?), and only a small hope for humans like in our real world. So please respect zombie movies standards.",Dawn of the Dead
405,gouldgang,Entertaining but not overly great,6,3 June 2019,Movie started out good but progressively the characters just started to get more and more stupid for no reason and it made me kind of lose interest. Especially the last half hour or so I was just kind of like... what? Did everyone lose the common sense they had throughout the movie. Regardless I love zombie/apocalypse movies and this one was a better one with a good cast.,Dawn of the Dead
406,khoekstra,A Re-Envisioning That's Actually Good!,9,17 March 2004,"Okay, I saw Dawn of the Dead tonight in a sneak preview and here's what I think... (Beware of random ""stream of consciousness"" thoughts)
I'm a huge fan of the original and I think this is a worthy remake. It's not without its flaws, but it is a solid film all around. I would recommend seeing it. There are several moments (for me) when I found myself saying ""what the f*** are you doing????!"" but I guess that's true of any horror film. For the most part, characters behave as I believe they would (and should) in this situation, but a few things are kind of ""out there."" The opening is fantastic (as those who've seen the first ten minutes on Sci-Fi channel can attest) and it doesn't let up from there. It draws the audience in. Many of the characters actually DEVELOP over the course of the film...a novel concept for horror buffs. Only a few characters don't grow...and you can imagine why. The ""fast zombies"" don't really bother me...they add a new dimension of terror, but might seem weird to the purists out there. Personally, I think they're TOO fast. I'd have opted for something faster than the classic zombies, but not THIS fast. I'm thinking ""speed walking"" would be ideal.
There's a rather large cast here and, with the exception of one guy who can't act his way out of a wet paper bag (you'll know who he is), the acting is very solid. Whoever did the soundtrack (or made the soundtrack choices) is brilliant. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. I nearly wet myself laughing at one point. Makeup effects are nice, as is the film quality in general. You'll know at the end why they sent the movie to the MPAA four times to get an ""R"" rating. As a side note, however, I think Passion of the Christ was probably more violent.   Great dialogue...only one or two (or three) lines in the whole film could be considered ""off"" or groaners. Great sense of humor... There were a lot of ""laugh out loud"" moments to break up the tension...all well placed.  The audience really got into it.
In short, go see it if you're a fan of the original or of horror films in general. You'll enjoy it. I'm about the most cynical person I know when it comes to ""remakes"" or ""re-envisionings"" of classic films and I thought this was a great effort. As I said, not perfect, but worth seeing... Enjoy!",Dawn of the Dead
407,bootderek,An Absolute Thrill Ride,9,18 December 2008,"This turned out to be pretty good. It matches standards with the original version, which was a blast. Everyone that worked on this film made it a success. All of the actors (and I mean all of them) made their characters believable and fresh. This is Zack Snyder's 3rd film in matters of directing, and I give him more than 5 stars. The action is all edge-of-your-seat type stuff, and it really makes the situation more deadly than needed, which was cool. I especially liked the scene where the survivors fight their way through the undead in the buses. That was cool.The one thing that I didn't understand is why they didn't fully explain what started the whole undead epidemic in the first place. Was it a virus? Nobody knows.Other than that, an absolute thrill ride.",Dawn of the Dead
408,callist,More fun than scary,9,18 February 2009,"Okay, so I'm not exactly a pro and this is my first ""review"" of a movie - really, how entertaining I as the average amateur found the movie.I'll start out with saying that I never saw the original movie (though I'd heard of it) so I didn't know what to expect - the gist of my reaction: Surprise. This movie was actually really entertaining in the funny sense - I don't think I've laughed quite this much during any other movie.Now, I don't know much about direction or lighting (I'm not even that good at spotting bad acting - if I can see people are bad actors then they are BAD) so I don't have much to say. Overall, the lighting is pretty light most of the time especially for a horror flick but I think that helped add to the ""realism"" - ""What would really happen and how would people really react if zombies were suddenly real?"".The - though meager - extra material was neat too - pretty entertaining. Overall a fun movie and recommendable for a night in - only 8 out of 10 though seeing as it wasn't as scary as it was funny.",Dawn of the Dead
409,moviefan69,YES! Better than the original!,10,20 March 2004,"Now let's get one thing clear right off the bat...I LOVE GEORGE ROMERO'S ORIGINAL MOVIE!!!! It is one of THE classics of horror. BUT....the remake surpasses it! Some have written that the movie makes no social statements. WHAT? Okay, the original made digs at consumerism by equating the zombies with mindless shoppers. However this one has a more profound subtext for a few of the characters. One of the survivors is pregnant. So the question is raised, as it is by many people in the real world, ""How can I bring a child into a world that's so screwed up?"".  The characters here also deal with an issue that the survivors in the original did not...what happened to their loved ones? In Romero's movie, NOT ONCE do the characters ever wonder about the fate of their friends and families. That issue is at the forefront of the new version. So to those that say there is no human drama here....what movie were you watching? But all that is incidental, what everyone wants to see this movie for is the zombies. Let me say to the purists out there....shuffling zombies ARE NOT SCARY!!!!! You can simply run, or in fact walk, right past them. Try that in the new movie. These flesh craving monsters will run your ass down, and be snacking on your vital organs before you can say ""undead"". Now THAT'S scary! The cast is excellent. Ving Rhames is the man, and owns every time he appears onscreen. Sarah Polley is a hottie, and maintains a cool head throughout. Jake Weber is very identifiable as the nice guy ""everyman"". You really care about these characters, and hope to see them survive. There is also great humor here. While on the roof of the shopping mall, our heroes communicate through large, handwritten signs with the owner of the gunshop across the street, who has retreated to his roof. There is a great scene where the on the roof of the mall, with binoculars, pick out zombies that resemble celebrities, and then have the gun shop owner blow them away. Also watch for the shop owner and Ving Rhames using their message boards back and forth to play chess. There are many nods to the original here, but they are very subtle. Watch for the heroes of Romero's version in cameo's. My favorite homage is right at the beginning of the movie. As Ana is driving down the road, we are treated to a high ariel shot looking down at her car on the highway. A helicopter flies in and out of frame. It is the same helicopted used by the characters in the original movie to escape the zombies that have overrun the city. So in the end, a great movie. Great tension. Great scares. Great humor. Great gore. A great treat for all horror fans.",Dawn of the Dead
410,bryandeth316,"In a world of bad remakes, this wasn't bad.",9,19 October 2004,"I went into this movie completely excited. And I wasn't even really disappointed either. The acting was very good, and I actually loved how they didn't follow the exact storyline. They took the basics of the original Dawn of the Dead and made it more contemporary. I knew they wouldn't be filming the movie at Monroeville Mall (the mall just 15 minutes outside of Pittsburgh where they filmed the original) but it was still awesome none the less. The script worked rather well, and the movie flowed nicely also. Granted I wasn't a huge fan of the fast moving zombies, but I suppose I can let that go because truthfully, maybe before rigor mortis sets in, you'd be able to move quickly, who knows? But I do know that I was on the edge of my seat through many parts of the movie, and you start to really care about the characters in the movie. I am anxiously waiting for 1 week to pass so that I can get my copy of Dawn. I already have it pre purchased.8/10 rating. The movie missed a perfect 10 for the simple fact that zombies SHOULD NOT run that fast.",Dawn of the Dead
411,chriskirk2,"Boy, does this rule!!!",10,20 April 2004,"I've seen the original Dawn a billion times. I specifically remember renting it from MAJOR VIDEO in 1983. I was 8 years old. The shocking gore gave me nightmares. When I was 13, I bought my own VHS copy. AT 21 I got the laserdisc for Christmas-still have it. I eventually bought the many DVD incarnations...etc. My point is this: I KNOW((and really love)the zombie genre, and I was weary of this remake. Why remake perfection? Because the lame action movie ""28 days later""(whatever 14-year old girl was quoted as saying it was the scariest horror film since the EXORCIST was retarded) made money? I feared this remake would suck. Well, it does not suck. It is,in fact, one of the top zombie flix, ever. DOTD 04' is a frightening, post 9/11 re-think of the classic original. The zombies are scary, not to mention fast. The first 20 minutes pull you in, and the sharp direction, acting, script, and editing keep you on edge. This is potent fun, with moments of sharp humor; as well as a strong sense of apocalyptic paranoia. This well-worthy rethink of the original is a blast. George Romero should be proud.",Dawn of the Dead
412,Dhawley-2,"Better than I expected, but Romero's version remains the best zombie film.",6,4 February 2006,"As a long-time horror movie fan, I was resistant to seeing this film when it opened in theaters. Like many who consider George Romero's original the best zombie flick made, the idea of remaking such a classic seemed unnecessary and, frankly, almost blasphemous. However, having read many fairly positive reviews of the film, I decided to get the DVD and see for myself. My comments, then, are for the 'Unrated Director's Cut', with additional scenes not found in the theatrical release. The film started off quite well; the ten minute pre-credit prologue delivered a real jolt, setting the stage for the rest of the film. While the basic premise was much like the original (see other reviews for story line), the inevitable comparison allows the differences to stand out. In this version, the main characters seem to easily walk into a nearly deserted mall; in the original, finding and getting into the zombie-infested mall was much more dramatic and realistic. This version, while entertaining, lacked the dramatic tension of the original, in large part because of the larger cast. There were simply too many characters, which detracted from the feeling of despair and isolation found in the original. There were, to be sure, some good performances. Sarah Polley was quite good as the no-nonsense heroine and Ving Rhames turned in another solid performance. The best acting, however (IMO), was that of Jake Webber as Michael, the television salesman who quickly shows leadership abilities. There were also less noteworthy performances. For me, the subplot involving Mekhi Phifer and his wife (played by Inna Korobkina) simply detracted from the overall effect. The whole business (spoiler alert) of Phifer's character, a petty crook, becoming Mr. Family Values in his unshakable desire to 'raise a family' didn't work. It really got ridiculous with his wife turning into a zombie (zombification is spread by the bite of one), and him making sure that she delivered a zombie infant (!). Those scenes stopped me cold, and seemed to be added simply to increase the gore factor. Now, the Director's cut reportedly contained more ""gore and character development"" than the theatrical release, but that may not necessarily be a good thing. In my opinion, there was just too much going on with these other characters, and they really didn't make the viewer care any more about them. On the subject of gore...yes, there are some very well-done effects (although not any more gruesome than the effects in 'Land of the Dead' or the original, for that matter). One thing that, to me, detracted from the film was making the zombies fast moving. During the film, the inclusion of 'news reports' and CDC (Center for Disease Control) spokespeople revealed that the cause of this infection is never identified, yet it is revealed that the zombies ""are dead...their circulatory, respiratory and other systems no longer work."" Okay, then how do the zombies manage to run like marathoners, break down doors, jump, etc. while their bodies decay? In the film '28 Days Later', one could accept fast-moving killers, since they were not the 'living dead' but rather people who turned into homicidal cannibals by a virus. Come on. If zombies are the reanimated dead, who are decomposing daily, it doesn't add up that they can run, jump etc. The bottom line for me is that, as another reviewer notes, it ""didn't suck,"" but certainly does not put the original in any jeopardy. Entertaining, with some solid performances and good special effects, but still inferior to the original.",Dawn of the Dead

414,fatleprechan,Satiric but not Satanic. Dawn of the Dead can't live up to the great original,6,25 June 2005,"Screenwriter James Gunn tries to add some new twists to George A. Romero's creepy 1978 script. But it's a hard act to follow. Our story follows registered nurse Ana ( Sarah Polly ) Who takes to the hillswith the rest of the Milwaukee area after her husband is murdered along with half the town by packs of rampaging zombies. It isn't long before she crashes her car off the panicked highway and runs into still human police officer Ken, played by the always excellent Ving Rhames. Banding together while dodging and executing the zombies alike, they meet up with a few more straggling survivors led by Mikhi Pfifer who has a pregnant girlfriend in desperate tow. In dire need of a safe house, and learning that many potential havens have been overrun by the bloodthirsty dead. They finally have to settle for breaking in to a large shopping mall. The problem with this, compared to Romero's genius original idea is that all the surprise element is gone for fans of the 1978 film. And the shocking quaintness of the inhabitants taking advantage of the mall's finer points seems lost in the shuffle of some pointless twists. In other words, during Romero's story, you could feel enough horror as to where you could picture yourself locked inside the mall. And you could relate to the extreme relief the raiders would be feeling in that situation. I didn't feel the same sense of urgency and therefore terror here. We don't even see that much of the mall. Instead, we have a revolving door of new characters most soon to be zombie food. And none all that interesting. In the original the cast was narrowed. Making it much easier to cozy up to the characters. Here a hard rock soundtrack keeps kicking in, not much of a substitute for Romero's eerie elevator music. There are some pluses, both Phifer and Rhames give credible performances as men in an impossible situation. Seeing how naturally these fine African American actors blend seamlessly with the rest of the cast, is a credit to Romero's vision. When 'Night of the Living Dead' debuted in 1969, Romero was ostracized for going with a black or 'Negro' leading man. He was told at the time that it was an outrage which would not wash with white audiences. Well here we are thirty six years later, and because of pioneers like Romero, black actors get the opportunities they deserve, while we scarcely notice the difference. All in all, I'd say 'Dawn of the Dead is not a total loss, it just doesn't approach the queasy horror of the original. And even though these zombies run much faster. Were still not quite as frightened that they might catch up. actually, this film is much more like an American version of '28 Days later' the British zombie takeoff, than it is to respecting Romero's Satanic vision. Good entertainment, but not permanently scarring horror. 6 out of a possible 10 T.H.",Dawn of the Dead

Many funny moments, scary scenes and combat scenes (i liked a scene when the street is filled with thousands of zombie).  Good character development for main casts (some of sidekicks are not developed well enough).However, if I see it as a remake, I do not really like it.

416,TMAN247,"Excellent movie, but not worthy of the moniker.",8,26 March 2004,"It is certainly refreshing to see a movie like Dawn of the Dead is doing so well in the box office.  This movie was beautiful in it's presentation of the apocalypse, full of dramatic camera angles, pulse pounding situations, and a realistic view of how people would act when faced with almost certain doom.  With the above being said, it doesn't deserve the name Dawn of the Dead. Despite the originals obvious shortcomings, i.e. cheesy make-up and techni-color blood, the originals story was much better.  It's presentation is stark, which in my opinion adds to the realism.  And the original is much gorier, which is part of the reason I see zombie movies to begin with. 
  The similarities between the two movies are weak, basically being trapped in a mall, and the strong characters being a woman and an African-American the only similarities (for those of you who are younger, this really was an important issue back in 1978, with the original Dawn of the Dead getting praise for it use of different types of heroes).   The monsters of the new film, and the zombies of the old are not even comparable; they are completely different in their nature.  I congratulate the makers of this film for what it was.

You can't really go too far with those elements when killing the undead is an integral part of your story but it is story that is most often sacrificed in favour of more killing. This film doesn't fall into that trap. Back to moderation:1)Horror movies in general rely on some degree of macho stereotypes and dialogue. Dawn Of The Dead is no different, but they keep it to a minimum and characters like Sarah Polley's are there to diffuse it before you are overwhelmed by it. The macho one-liners and tag lines serve their purpose well, creating the campy comic relief that makes these movies fun without sending the film all the way into the category of ridiculous pumped up action film.2)Some comments here have accused the film of using a lot of CGI. They're wrong. I hate overuse of CGI and this film holds back, favouring the good old method of making up hundreds upon hundreds of extras (watch the special features on the DVD if you don't believe me). A good special effects team who hire quality local make-up artists and stunt personnel can still outdo the best CGI effects and this movie is a prime example. House Of The Dead went cheap on the make-up and put all their eggs in the CGI basket  wrong choice. This film gets it right.3)Sappy, passive females and tacked on love stories will ruin a fun, fast-paced horror/slasher film every time. There is a little of that here, but it is inventive  a pregnant couple, brief 'the world is ending' sex, and a sacrifice ending that actually avoids being heavy-handed. I was surprised. Very surprised. Good job.4)Modern heavy music has come to replace ominous synth pads and orchestral atmosphere in the genre. Dawn Of The Dead mixes both quite well. A few well placed contemporary tracks serve to update the feel without turning it into a music video or a vehicle by which to sell a soundtrack album.5)Editing. The new school seems to be obsessed with fast cuts and rock video pacing (28 Days Later relies on the digital format and its editing tricks - and loses tons of atmosphere because of it). This does nothing to build tension, suspense or fear. I'm not saying that Dawn Of The Dead is by any means a Tartovsky art film, but they at least let the camera linger a little longer than 2 seconds and you can get a sense of the isolation with some well designed long shots and single takes. The juxtaposition between the ominously empty mall and the claustrophobic streets is well conceived and executed.Recent films like 28 Days Later and House Of The Dead didn't find a way to use these elements in moderation and the results were laughable, annoying, and just plain awful. Kudos to the Dawn Of The Dead team for making a zombie movie that is true to the genre, true to its history and yet, still a watchable and wildly entertaining film. In the end, the film pulls off being engaging, suspenseful, realistic (in context of course), and still a heck of a lot of campy, gory fun. Recommended to all sceptics of remakes and modern horror!",Dawn of the Dead
420,g-is-for-gluggermuffin,"a real gore-fest that, unfortunately, sucked.",3,4 September 2009,"Well I apologize to all those fans out there that loved this movie but I hated it. I was expecting it to be really cool, which it was pretty cool for the first half hour but then it collapsed into a meaningless heap of zombie heads being blown off and confusion. I must admit that i was extremely tired when i watched this movie, and so i even fell asleep a few times. Maybe because of this it made less sense to me, but my friend, who did not fall asleep said it made no sense to him either. One of the major points of oddity is that i fell asleep for like a minute, while there were zombies been blown up on screen, and when I awoke, there was a naked lady running on a treadmill and happy music and cheery people. It was most confusing. This film also practices the art of repetition a lot. Such as: 'Oh look! A zombie! Shoot it's head off! Oh no! another zombie! shoot out it's brains! What's that heading towards us? oh! It's another zombie! shoot off it's head!' Yes, the blood effects and head shots look quite effective and realistic, but alas, this is not enough to make a good movie. In terms of storyline, this film had none, and although it provides you with a couple of possibilities as to why there are zombies running around, it never explains which is the correct one, and how the undead came to be. May i also add that if this movie was intended to be scary, it had quite the opposite effect, and may i suggest that Zack Snyder enrols in a career of comedy?",Dawn of the Dead
421,rblade963,Possibly one of the greatest Zombie Films,10,8 September 2008,"Well it may just be my favorite zombie film.Just wanted to comment that the camera work was excellent the way the camera and lighting are used threw this film provides such emotion and clarity to the film I can sit and watch it with the sound off that's how good Zack Sniders work is.The actors were absolutely believable, out standing performances from Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Sarah Polley, and Inna Korobkina and so many more I cannot list. The entire cast was just so good.I know this is a late review but have just joined IMDb and this movie was one that I had to make mention to.If you love zombie films as I do this film will in no way disappoint you. Even though this is a remake of the original 1978 film by George A. Romero which is a classic and love but Zack Sniders work here really blew me away.A must see, absolutely amazing.",Dawn of the Dead
422,Diaboliqa666,This is THE BEST Zombie Flick ever and deserves respect.,10,3 March 2005,"First I have to say I have noticed a lot of people bag this movie, and thats fine, but I don't think a true Horror or Zombie fan would ever do such a thing. This version of Dawn of the Dead is awesome, I love it, it is my favorite movie ever - thus 10/10.Before I get to the plot I have to say I love the fact that there a ties to the original DoD movie in this one.. The preacher in this is the Cop in the first one, the truck that Norma drives is a BP truck, like the ones they use in the first movie to barricade the doors - They even have light hearted moments displayed in the music choice when they are in the mall trying on clothes and stuff. There are more as well, and it just makes it so coolThe plot has been tweaked from the original, there is no Biker gang and no chopper, but there is a pregnant woman. The Zombies are a hell of a lot scarier as they actually move at normal (or it could be suggested at an above normal) speed and, as in the first movie, they retain some behaviors and knowledge from when they are alive, but you will not see them trying to play hocky.I can not count how many times this movie has inspired ""what if..."" conversations between me and my friends. The idea is wonderful and I love the fact there is no explanation for where the virus came from.In case you haven't seen/heard of this film here is the Basic plot: Something has happened and the dead are not staying dead. As expected there is carnage every where. This throws 12 ""survivors"" together in, of all places, a mall. Soon the mall becomes surrounded by Zombies (which leads to a dark and highly amusing game of Hollywood Squares) and the inhabitants of the Mall decided they want to die somewhere else. They make an escape, but alas there are few survivors by the time they make it to their destination.Amongst all this you get to learn more about the characters, you see some of them die, there is a touch of spiritualism (just a small dash) and in some cases it will leave you with many questions about the nature of man, the future and all sorts of crazy possibilities for human civilisation.",Dawn of the Dead
423,jaynobody,Dawn of the Dead was great!,9,19 March 2005,"I love this movie. Unlike all the CGI crap that passes for special effects these days, Dawn of the Dead (2004) is a breath of fresh air. Most of the special effects are done the old fashioned way, and it shows.This movie starts fast and doesn't let up. The cast is great, and it has characters you really care about. How often does that happen in horror movies today? Sarah Polly is great as the female lead, and Jake Weber is also great as the reluctant leader. Ving Rhames is tough as always, and every other cast member is very good.This movie is a great end of the world film, capitalizing on post 9-11 fears and bring Romeros legendary epic into the 21st century. It also is one the most nihilistic movies to come out of Hollywood in some time. It was actually scary too. I look forward to seeing more work from director Zack Synder.I own the directors unrated cut DVD which has some great extras, and some that are kind of cheesy too. The directors commentary is great, and I never like those things either.My only regret is I did not know this movie was being filmed in Toronto, or I would have tried to get a job as an extra zombie.",Dawn of the Dead
424,paudman,I lasted as long as the opening song,2,2 October 2021,"Well it started off okay. Then we had this absolutely rubbish song. I spent the rest of the movie trying to work out if it was a comedy, or not, based entirely on that track. That, plus the song over the end credits, completely ruined the movie. Oh, plus the total lack of character development, the cliches and the 'obvious what's going to happen' parts. Even at the very end it still wouldn't go away, like a bad rash. I love zombie movies but this one is down there with World War Z. Way down there.",Dawn of the Dead
425,nmthomas-20486,Solid effort,9,17 October 2021,"This film is filled with tongue in cheek moments and gore. I really love the first 20 minutes where full on carnage pursues and depictions of how people react to the outbreak is well conceived. The lead characters although stereotyped, are an enjoyable mixture of people - not all of them likable or with development- but instead are known through their real-time behaviours, actions and choices, to denote the cowardly, from the brave. Solid remake which doesn't take itself too seriously and has withheld the test of time in terms of zombie movies over the last 16 years .",Dawn of the Dead
426,rabiddog67,Hell on Earth,10,19 March 2004,"I just got back from watching this remake of the George Romero zombie classic and I am happy to report that it does justice to its predecessor. I was little wary that the zombies run in this version, but it really works because you can't simply walk past these bad boys and shove cream pies in their rotting faces. This version probably owes as much to 28 Days Later as it does to Romero's film. The movie kicks into gear in a matter of a few minutes and scarcely takes it foot off the throttle. The acting, by and large, is very good and the effects are terrific. I hope it makes mucho bucks and inspires a rebirth in the zombie genre, perhaps even Romero can get back into the action.",Dawn of the Dead
427,matris1,"More action than horror, but gets a lot more right than it does wrong",7,28 March 2021,"The good: It's a solid, fast paced zombie action-horror film. There's enough blood and gore to keep enthusiasts of the genre pleased and there's minimal cheese to starve off the eye rolls. The narrative structure itself also feels nicely bookended, with a simple plot that is easy to follow. There's no story surprises in this film, it's exactly what you'd expect. And that's a good thing.The Bad: The characters are all pretty flat and the acting ranges from mediocre to good (ving rhames being a stand-out). Sorry Ty Burrell (Modern Family), you just aren't meant to play the 'bad-boy'. You're too nice! Also, Zack Synder tries to go for the feels in some scenes, it's a nice try but it doesn't grab hold. There's so much death and carnage that you don't have a vested interest in anyone as the movie conditions you expect a shelf-life for every character.Should you watch it? If you like zombie movies. Then most definitely. The film ticks almost every 'zombie movie' box and does it well. Being a remake of the classic film helps, obviously. Recommended.",Dawn of the Dead
428,montecristo42,Better than the original? Spoilers Ahead,8,23 March 2004,"OK, OK, everybody hold on a second. First of all, let me make it perfectly clear that I am a Romero fan, no doubt about it.  Not an obsessed fan, not a zombie movie maniac, but a fan nonetheless.  I thought Night was a masterpiece.  I've never seen Day. I recently (as in the last week) watched both Dawns.  And I have to say it--I think the new one is the better film.  Here's why: 1.  Character Development--We get peeks (and only peeks) into these characters former lives, their motivations, and this is the artistic way to do it.  Granted, CJ's character change was a bit hard to swallow.  But every other major character was more than just a cardboard cutout.Ving Rhames' and his desire to find his brother becomes his desire to help his new family in the mall. The dude from U-571: more than halfway through the film we find out that he was married with children, was a poor husband, was a good father, and held tons of bad jobs.  Yet he is the voice of reason, he is the father of the group, he is the good man in a storm. Sarah Polley: we've seen what she went through in the beginning of the film, and therefore we don't need to hear it again, so we don't.Mekhi Phifer:  Though a complete maniac when he reaches his demise, we can understand why he's become a maniac.2.  Likable characters:  This goes a long way in my book.  I'm not saying I didn't like the characters in the original.  But they were too one-dimensional for me.  The white cop just becomes a lunatic.  We don't get glimpses into their past lives or why they are who they are.  There's absolutely no chemistry between the father and mother-to-be.  The black cop just suddenly decides that he doesn't want to live anymore, but then gets his motivation back at the end.  I thought that was done pretty poorly.On the other hand, I really felt for some (obviously not all) of the characters in the new one.  Even Andy from the gun shop, who has a mere two or three lines of dialogue, I felt for.  The people in the new one are more fleshed out, more human, and more likable.3.  HUMOR:  This is an added-bonus for horror movies, which Romero was great to put into Night.  But, the humor in the original Dawn seems so dated now. The idea of one-stop shopping is the only line that stands out in my mind.Compare that to the humor in the new one.  Take the scene where Andy's shooting zombies in the parking lot and Ving's holding up the sign to tell him which celebrity to shoot--Jay Leno, Burt Reynolds (""man he's good, that didn't even look like Burt Reynolds"").4.  LESS Stupid Character Moments:  The original Dawn has many of these. With the white cop taking his sweet old time and running around like a maniac.Yes, the new one has its share, but I would say there were less as a whole. Like when that chick went to save the dog.5.  Fast Zombies:  Obviously, this makes zombie attacks much more intense.6.  More of a feel good movie (despite the credits):  The new version felt much more hopeful.  The people all, eventually anyways, came together, formulated a plan, decided to risk themselves to help out Andy, etc.  In the original, the characters were hiding from the zombies and society, and seemed content to live their days out in a shopping mall.There's more I could say, but I've already gone on for too long.  This should generate (hopefully) a lot of comments.",Dawn of the Dead
429,nickybreez,You Know what....,8,20 March 2005,"I'm really starting to come around to remakes... At first I hated this movie, and i hated the Texas Chainsaw Massacre even more. I'm a movie nerd, i downright loved both of the originals. But then something happened... the remakes came to DVD and i enjoyed them 10 times more at home then at the theater... Anyways, this is a very solid movie. Superb acting by everyone, incredible special effects, even better, sound, dynamic picture... I love it. Ving Rhames is the man as always. Sarah Polley, who annoyed me a few times was strong casting, and everyone else was good too. I don't have to go over the plot, anyone who knows anything about movies knows the plot to dawn of the dead. 2 words... zombies. mall. I have to say though, this is not a social commentary, this is a run-of-the-mill horror flick, but its great. Unlike this movie, and TCN, some remakes suck. The Ring, The Grudge... terrible. It was all boo scares (although the grudge had great atmosphere). All in all I'm very satisfyed, and I'm totally looking forward to the evil dead remake, as well as the amityville horror remake (which was a great idea and has a great lead, the classic Ryan Reynolds.. i mean come on Van Wilder becomes a psycho, u cant go wrong...

430,thedudeishere41,serious zombie movie without cheesy comedy.,9,16 February 2010,"I never seen the original movie. I was going to get that one but seen the new version so I got it. this is a great movie. some zombie movies are funny and are not taken serious at all. this movie is great. they don't take any prisoners. the story get better as the movie goes on. you really go through a lot of action and different scenarios. I know a lot of zombies movies start off with almost everyone killed. in this movie however the news show policeman and miliaray men going after, shooting and killing zombies on the TV news flash where the main characters are. so they still do have a lot of people who were not bit by the zombies in this movie that make cameos. it is a more realistic movie then the other comedy/zombie movies. this is the best zombie movie I have seen. Romero really great job on making you feel like there could by a zombies waiting to bite you at all times. the feel of the movie was great. you got to see it.",Dawn of the Dead
431,vortexrider,Much better than I expected it to be,10,20 March 2004,"First of all I am not even going to compare this re-make to the original because it is unfair to do that. if people wanted it to be like the original they would rent the original from 1978.On its own Dawn Of The Dead stands out for the same reasons the original stood out. You see horror and gore unlike anything you've seen before. The wounds are realistic. You see brains fly from the zombies' heads. This movie was obvously intended not to hold any realism back. When someone in it, zombie or a human, are shot you see blood sputter and smear very realistically.Besides the gore realism this movie succeeds at scaring me with genuine ""pop out of your seat"" scares. You know how some horror movies just scare you with some blood murder scene and leave you scared from disgust rather than from surprise. Dawn of The Dead director skillfully overcomes this and scares you when you least expect it. There are some scenes where everyone is happy and calm and you relax your nerves than a zombie jumps out and your pants suddenly get in danger of being pooped.I could truly bond with some of the characters and feel their pain and fear. You see expressions on their faces change as they see people around them die and realize that their families are dead. I do think, however, that there wasnt much social commentary in this film, that is its just action action action. There is no pauses or change of pace for viewers or characters to behave differently and reflect somehow on what has happened and possibly see some conections with real world.Cinematography in this one is not bad. I am not an expert on it, but I think in some scenes the color was too intense to portray feeling, everything looked cartoonishly bright. Then, especially in zombie attack and struggle, the camera was jerking around as if its some journalist filming in a riot. The camera was moved around so much it was hard to follow whats happening. Then the frame rate was reduced as well, probably to add more realism and to cover up the special effects, but was definately not hurting my viewing experience.I give this movie 9 out of 10",Dawn of the Dead
432,smithclarkst,This movie is one of my favorites,10,20 October 2014,"I love zombie movies but this one takes the cake. I really like the action and how tense this movie is. The environment is nothing new, it'a a mall but for me you can't go wrong with that. It is a classic ! One good thing is the cast, they are very good. The movie it is really good, because of the style it has. The film got the right amount of gore and brutality, not too much, not to little.I saw some people saying that this movie is really scary, if you don't like horror movies MAYBE. I don't know where this film is really scary, there are some scenes where you maybe jump a bit but it's not that bad. If you want to see a good zombie and horror movie, this one is for you. This movie is for everyone- Everything but that, TOP ! This movie is one of my favorites.",Dawn of the Dead
433,Disarmed-Doll-Parts,What a remake should be.,8,17 March 2007,"I loved NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD '68. It' one of the creepiest, most atmospheric and foreboding tales of terror I've ever seen. I also loved DAY OF THE DEAD '85, for the same reasons. I didn't love DAWN OF THE DEAD '78. It had little atmosphere and terrible special effects. The script was god-awful and although it had that unique 70's drive in charm, similar to THE HILLS HAVE EYES '77 and CARRIE '76, it really was a bit of a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I did like it, and enjoyed watching it. I also got the ""we-are-all-mindless-consumers"" social commentary surrounding the film. But whenever I watched it I found myself wanting more. More atmosphere, more gore, more entertainment.Enter James Gunn, Troma screenwriter and horror fan. He wrote two of the most recognisable Troma films; TROMEO AND JULIET and TERROR FIRMER. With the new remake craze Hollywood is on, Gunn decide he wants to write a proper script before some hack writer gets a hold of DAWN OF THE DEAD rights. He writes an incredible, action packed screenplay, and with the combined talent of Zack Snyder directing, they set out and make the best remake since THE FLY '86, and in doing so slightly surpass the original in quality.Instead of a heavy handed political satire with crappy make up and terrible pacing, DAWN OF THE DEAD '04 is an action packed barrel of gore, extremely dark humor, witty dialogue and creative scenes. It seems like Gunn wanted to put as much original situations as he could with a cast of 16 characters. When you really think about it, Gunn took a lot away from his experiences with Troma, and it shines through with the outrageous situations he puts these people in. Not many other horror remakes would put so much at risk with how different this is from the original, and I guess thats why not many other remakes are very well respected.The makeup effects, gore and special effects in this film were of a very very high standard. And the zombies themselves were great. An obese elderly zombie woman, a zombie childbirth, a Chinese jogging zombie, a paraplegic zombie, and various celebrity look-a-like zombies, such as Jay Leno, Burt Reynolds and Rosie O'Donnell. The deaths were also awesomely creative, the scene where the old truck driving lady finds Mekhi Phifer and his ""family"" is masterful.Overall DAWN OF THE DEAD is a great film that does something most remakes don't; it surpasses the original. One of my favourite films, 8/10.",Dawn of the Dead
434,shirleyfuller,Better than the original- and scary as hell.,8,27 August 2018,"Dawn of the Dead is a remake of an older zombie film by the same name but in my opinion, it is a superior effort- which is strange as most remakes are inferior in quality. The major change here is that Snyder has decided to make the zombies have the capacity to run, which is a scary thought indeed. As creepy as the slow undead were there was always the chance to outmaneuver them, but things are not so simple this time around. The usual zombie trope of a bunch of characters clustered together and hiding away is how the film goes about it but it manages to characterize the survivors instead of just using them as zombie fodder. Some scenes are terrifying and there is a palpable sense of tension. This is a great horror movie and a great zombie one also. Go watch it.",Dawn of the Dead
435,saint#50,Headshots & Chainsaws...necessary.,10,21 March 2004,"Just after seeing Dawn of the Dead, I was left in shock and giddy postcoital glee.  Man, I had SEEN a zombie movie.  You know what, I had seen a damn good movie.After 5 minutes of establishing the normalcy of the Wisconsin suburbs, we get the initial attack, which starts out with a scene more akin to the original zombie film Night of the Living Dead, then goes into mass destructionland via the last string of disaster movies.The opening credits are the most powerful set of titles I've ever seen in a film.  Scored to Johnny Cash's ""When the Man Comes Around"", they evoke feelings of genuine megadeth and apocalypse.  I was reminded of watching the planes crashing into the WTC on 9-11.  In fact, this is one of the first films that you will actually want to watch every second.The plot picks up from there with the heroine escaping/meeting a weird cross-section of Americans en route to the refuge of the mall.  Here, they escape the devastation momentarily through the trappings of the mall. These genuinely comic scenes alleviate the near-constant tension in DOTD.  The plot picks up and gets more horrific, in a similar fashion to the original. Blah, blah--you know this part, so I'll skip it.  I will say that the people in this movie are more sensible than in other zombie movies where they run around helpless to get eaten.  The survivors, more or less, have survived for a reason--the ability to turn off their emotions and kill coldly.The film as a whole was shatteringly powerful.  The ricketing force of the whole package was overwhelming.  This is the first horror film to update the genre to the level of style of other serious films from the 2000's. Forget that it is a remake; the plot is lifted, but the tone and visual style are totally original.  In fact, this may be the most original film I've seen since Being John Malkovich.  It seemed that, after the Texas Chainsaw remake and a slew of cruddy gore films with heavy metal soundtracks, the whole Gen X (or Y or whatever) attitude would never translate successfully into anyone's films beside Quentin Tarantino.  Then, blam, here it is.
The handheld camera effects, believable characterizations, MTV editing, and overwhelming tone of nihilistic humor actually come together in this film. Gone are the 4th-barrier breaking self-references of the Scream generation, thank God.   I was starting to think that the next trend in horror movies would be a lá The Ring: a revisionism of the golden era of horror cinema that would be serious and slow-paced.  I'm glad I was wrong.  Here, the director uses all the latest tricks to actually further the impact of the material.  He also mocks his characters with the playful smile of doom. Nevertheless, the tension pervades the attitude; we care about these people because they seem real.  In a word: ensnaring.Say goodbye to the schlock of yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, we have evolved.",Dawn of the Dead
436,jickweez,More rip-off than remake,4,23 March 2004,"Being a huge fan of Romero's original, I couldn't wait to see an updated version of the movie that haunted my teen years. I even was all ready to get advanced tix for the opening day. But after seeing the film's first 10 minutes on the USA network, I became less than enthused. And after seeing the rest of the movie, I feel more than cheated. This version is more like a rip-off of 28 Days Later than a remake of the original Dawn. The sluggish, dreamlike movements of the zombies are replaced with the jerky, rabid sprint that rendered 28 Days refreshing and original. This lame ""remake"" even stole the staccato camera style of 28 Days. Of course, the plot is laughable (not in an ironic way either) and the characters half dimensional - but what really ruined this flick is its utter disregard to its original material. The CGI peppered throughout also prove that nothing can beat the low-budget creepiness created by good old Karo syrup, red food color and overcooked pasta (see brains and intestines). At best, this is an above-ground Resident Evil. 4 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
437,poehlmann,Yawnfest cannot compare to original,1,10 April 2004,"I saw this movie after - and only after - I had been assured that it compared favorably to the original.  I'll never be able to trust those people again.  This is another ""horror"" film that isn't scary, isn't original in any way, and doesn't have any particular redeeming value whatsoever.  It's shot like a typical commercial or music video director would shoot, and the story suffers in the same way - there is no real character development and no dramatic development to sustain a feature length.  What we do have here is essentially the video game version of the original.  Retained are the shoot-em-up scenes of zombie butchery, but gone are the elements of humor and humanity that made the original so original in the first place.  The only attempts at humanizing the film are so utterly misplaced as to be absurd or laughable.  It's a one note movie and that note is one that really ought to leave it's audience feeling disgusted at the end - not because of the gore, but because of the utter waste of time we have been subjected to.",Dawn of the Dead
438,Lebowski85,One Reamake Worth Watching,7,27 May 2006,"I'm not normally a fan of remakes as most people ruin what was good about the original. However, the zombie genre has developed in the last few years, and what was good about the original may not be conceived as good in this day and age. The original obviously being a cult classic zombie flick, possibly the best ever, with a retro look about it that could never be re-created. So the Director had a decision to make, a gamble one might say. Try and Stick to what made the original great or try something new. He tried something new and did a very good job in my opinion.He obviously stuck to the basic story line but i feel there are other aspects to this film that make it good. First off, i felt an original cast was always going to be needed and the actors were excellent. I feel Ving Rhames and Mekhi Phifer, the only well known actors in the film, do really well and all of the other actors played their part superbly.Secondly, i don't know much about this director Zack Snyders work, but I'm going to look into more of his stuff as there was an aesthetic about the movie, a slickness one might say about it that seemed to make the movie flow nicely and the moods within the film be it, comical, horrific, romantic or Sad were shown well and entwined throughout. Be it the moment Ana and Michael fall for each other, Andy The Gunman Dies or when they're running from the zombies screaming and shouting into an elevator only for the screams and hectic camera work to stop and the Calm soothing Elevator Music starts, that i felt was a stroke of genius. It works in a very Dark way and this kind of humour can be seen throughout the film.This film was all about the Direction the Director was going to take it. He took a chance and in my opinion it paid off. A job very well done. Any fan of the traditional zombie flick may not like it as it does steer from the tried and tested formula seen for years, but otherwise i can see most people enjoying this film, especially if you liked 28 Days Later. 7/10",Dawn of the Dead
439,UltimateDarkness,A GREATER THAN GREAT REMAKE! Surpasses the original! *NO SPOILERS*,10,20 March 2004,"Words like great, fantastic, spectacular, fabulous, and wonderful are perfect adjectives to describe the Dawn Of The Dead remake. I saw it last night, and loved it so much I plan on seeing it again today. I am a huge fan of the original, I even wore my Dawn Of The Dead shirt made to honor the original to see the remake last night, but I believe that the remake has got it beat by its entertainment and production values. The original will always be a classic, and was the model for pretty much all zombie movies after it to follow, and, until I saw its remake last night, I felt it was the greatest zombie movie ever. I now feel that its remake is the best ever. It has better special effects, better acting, and a manic energy and thoroughly pervasive creepiness that pervades and oozes from the entire movie! This is a MUST SEE FILM for any self-respecting fan of the original Dawn, ANY zombie movie, ANY horror fan, and ALL non-horror fans who have any interest at all in being IMMENSELY ENTERTAINED and CAPTIVATED by a movie. I gave it 10 outta 10, and if I could have given it more, I would have! Its even better than a 10! If you haven't seen it yet, STOP READING THIS REVIEW RIGHT NOW, and GO SEE IT!",Dawn of the Dead
440,seangd,"Very fun. A STRONG ""6"" if not a ""7""",7,22 March 2004,"I saw the original movie, and I must say this was a great remake.  I prefer the frantic, ""light on their feet"" zombies as opposed to the sluggish, slow moving ones in the original (thank you ""28 Days Later"").  The old zombies were not that scary; I mean, you could probably skip away from those guys! Or just break into a ""brisk walk"" and you'd leave them in the dust.  Not these new ones though; they full-on sprint right at you!  I dig it. Furthermore, the violence and gore in this movie was very well done.  In a movie like this, that can make or break you.  Also, it's nice to see a movie that has some CGI, but doesn't rely too heavily on it.  Bravo Mr. Snyder! I'm excited about your next project!",Dawn of the Dead
441,thebigrodney,Enjoyed Most of This Film,8,20 March 2004,"This film was very entertaining if you take it for what it is...a story about dead people taking over the planet. Fast-paced, creepy, well done effects, great acting, etc. If you want to break down the finer points, I have only two small complaints. First, not one character showed me the ""what the hell is going on"" panic mode that I think would be overtaking me in a situation like that. And the other-the shot that Mekhi Phifer's character took at Ving Rhames' character missed by a mile at point blank range while throughout the rest of the film most everyone was dead-on accurate.I love horror films. I love horror films that keep your heart racing. This one does the trick for me. Wow, my wife even liked it and I had to talk her into going with me.I think I may have seen the original when I was a little kid but don't remember it. I am now going to track it down on DVD just for comparitive reasons.Solid 8/10.",Dawn of the Dead
442,andrewcaniglia,It's a good movie for the most part,7,17 November 2019,"A lot of the nine and ten star reviews are from around the time this movie was released. I don't think this movie deserves that much hype, although it certainly is a solid film. It's a AAA action horror movie: the whole thing is beautifully shot, and no expense was spared with location and special effects. That being said, some of the movie is kind of ridiculous and not in a good way. Some of the characters are just throwaway set pieces and it suffers from the general maximalism trend of the mid 2000s.
However, this is not a bad film by any means. There's a lot of action, and it doesn't overstay its welcome with the 100 minute runtime. Some of the performances are believable and touching. It's not a ""meh"" movie either, it's definitely a contender for one of the best zombie films of all time. I just think the hype that surrounded its release and its status as ""the remake that didn't suck"" makes people hype it too much, it's not ""28 Days Later"".",Dawn of the Dead
443,Sofalofa,The MTV generation strikes again,4,2 April 2004,"Funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to Romero's version tend to be very young (judging by their other posts). What we have here is a slick, action packed, gory and ""Whoopee"" filled 2 hour MTV video. Frantic editing, pop-video camera work, ""cool"" music blah blah blahActually it ain't bad compared to other recent remakes (Chainsaw Massacre was a total disaster)... pretty good acting all round, totally predictable in the ""who will die next"" stakes and a total cash in on the Dawn Of The Dead name that will generate plenty of revenue alone by fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity...Don't remakes of classics get on your nerves? Can they REALLY not come up with something original? Why remake Dawn Of The Dead? The things that made the original special (the middle segment kids think is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how when you get everything you ever wanted you still ain't happy) are totally missing. This is an action flick, plain and simple. The faster the better. If you are into action flicks (and as this, the 2004 version is well done) fair enough, but for anyone who likes a little substance to their films... get ready to sigh (again)...Watch the cinemas over the next few years as we get The Godfather series remade by whoever the most fashionable Pop director is at the moment, and Star Wars remade, with all the kids saying how the new version is miles better cos the old version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds...Not bad, but in 10 years they will still be discussing the Romero version, not this pap",Dawn of the Dead
444,aimforthehead,Zack Snyder's remake of Dawn of the dead,7,8 February 2007,"Zack Snyder's remake of Dawn of the dead proves he is a good director. I was impressed with the effort put into the special effects. I was disappointed by the fact that they did not stick more to George Romero's original plot. There were major differences and more character's seeking refuge in the mall. A select few of the character's were rather annoying and a few of the actors performance's could of been better. Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Jake Weber gave the better performance's in this film. Their plans to go to an island on Steve's boat go awry and the ending is very vague. My thought is the ending was left that way in case they want to do a sequel in the future. Overall it is not the director's fault the script was lacking a bit. This film would of been much better with a few script changes and a few of the character's being eliminanted. But sill it is worth watching.",Dawn of the Dead

446,astonmartin7,Unrated Director's Cut is the only way to go,9,18 February 2007,"I thought the remake of Dawn of the Dead would be a stupid waste of time and then I heard Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames would be in it. Sounded good so far. Watched it at the movie theatre and thought it was a solid remake...Picked up the Unrated director's cut on DVD (109 mins) and fell in love with the film, especially Jake Weber's turn as Michael, the unlikely hero (""I sell televisions at Best Buy""). He is so engaging and magnetic in this film that I actually watched all of season 2 of Medium, a program he co-stars on; Patricia Arquette is the lead.This film is so watchable that I struggle not to watch it on consecutive days (already seen it 4 times). Some films you can watch once and be done with it; others will stay with you for a very long time and not just because of their accessibility or universality, there is something called cinema magic and you can't always put your finger on it.Get down with the sickness.P.S. Watch only until just before the final credits begin.",Dawn of the Dead
447,Slagathor,A good remake,7,19 March 2004,"Dawn of the Dead--an old favorite of mine--has been remade with a certain degree of flair. The characterization is strong, and most if not all of the social commentary of the original has survived intact. In certain ways, it is an even deeper film than the original (especially with the relationship between a solitary survivor and the main group). As would be expected from a Juliard graduate, Ving Rhames is the stand out, but the supporting cast is equally as strong.The effects are simple and yet effective, the zombies behave very much like other zombies (there is more of a debt to 28 Days Later than to Night of the Living Dead in terms of zombie agility), and the film is quickly plotted out.I'd see the film if I were you. 7/10",Dawn of the Dead
448,johnnyfive,do people just not get it!,9,3 April 2004,"Yup, I would say that this is a remake worthy of the original.  Yes I know that there are people that swear by the original Romero classic, hell I myself was very apprehensive before I saw this.As a fan of horror and more-so of zombie movies (Which have been too thin on the ground), this has to be the best zombie movie since the original. Better than the original?...... All I can say is decide for yourself. But as a modern day zombie movie, it has plenty of scares, gore and some good humour makes for a good watch.As i have just mentioned zombie movies have been thin on the ground, but 2004 seems to be year of the zombie, with the weak and inept ""House of the Dead"", the impressive and funny looking homage that is ""Shaun of the Dead"" (Which has been getting some good reviews) ""Resident Evil Apocalypse"" which looks as if it takes off straight after the end of the first and maybe, just maybe Romero will have his ""Twilight of the dead"" out on release before the end of the year (but i doubt it). So if like and you are unsure about going to see it, dont expect the original, just enjoy it.......You will.",Dawn of the Dead
449,lomticks_of_toast,fun,8,25 March 2004,"This film was fun (8/10).  Lots of big plot holes, but overall an enjoyable experience if you prefer adventure-horror vs. straight-up horror, like me. Being a HUGE fan of the original, I tried to ""leave it outside the theater"" and approach this as an entirely new film, but of course that's impossible.~~Spoilers~~Two plot points (among several) which I did NOT care for:1.  If the route to the mall was so clear at first, why did only a handful of people make it there for refuge?  I'll assume they all headed for other ""safe-havens"", like the church or fort. 2.  What was the deal with the head in the cooler during the ending credits? Who put it in there, and why (and what happened to them)?  Made no sense to me.One main plot point that I didn't like was that there was very little time devoted to securing the mall/barricading.  Basically, the characters checked the doors to make sure they were locked and from that point on the mall was secure.  I guess I didn't realize mall door glass was indestructible when you've got 1000 zombies pushing/pounding on it...also, what about the glass smashed by our survivors to enter the mall in the first place?  Did they immediately patch it up?  Preparing a stronghold has always been my favorite part of zombie films (see NOTLD, DawnOTD, ReturnOTLD, and even the film Demon Night, as examples) and there was virtually none of it here.  And am I supposed to believe there was only one set of 2 elevators in the entire mall?  No stairs?!?!  I bring this up because there were a few zombies on the 1st floor in the beginning, but they seemed to make no effort to find the 3 security guards upstairs...Also, the film devoted very little time to showing the breakdown of society (although, thankfully, more than the disappointing 28 Days Later).  The original's periodic television broadcasts gave you the feeling there were other people out there trying to survive, as well as give you some limited info on the status outside the mall and the phenomenon in general.  When the broadcasts end about 3/4 into the original film, it was a powerful way to illustrate the hopelessness of the situation.  For all we know in THIS film, these are the very last people alive.  We hope not, we assume not, but we have no way of knowing.I enjoyed CJ's character a lot.  At first, I thought, ""Oh, great.  A cliche character who thinks he's tough but is the most cowardly of the bunch - he's going to pull a Miguel (see Day of the Dead) and screw everything up."" But I was thankfully wrong.  It was nice to see this sort of character ""grow"" as the film progressed.  Plus, by the end he was just funny and ""cool"".All these complaints aside, I look forward to getting the DVD and adding this one to my Zombie Film Collection.",Dawn of the Dead
450,MicktheGreat,Dawn of the Dead is a successful remake on most levels...,7,30 March 2004,"Dawn of the Dead is a remake of Romero's earlier work of the same title. The story basically revolves around a storyline of a zombie epidemic. Fighting for their lives, a group of survivors barricade themselves inside a mall in attempts to stay alive. The group consists of a tough cop (Rhames), a nurse (Polley), a couple (Phifer & Korobkina) expecting a child, a suburbanite (Weber), a mall security guard (Kelly), and a cast of other characters.-POSSIBLE SPOILERS-I felt that this movie worked on most levels. I've seen the Romero original before (although it has been a few years ago) and I thought that this was just as good as the original (if not better...). I thought that the characters portrayed by Rhames and Weber were both done very well as I felt bad for those guys and felt that both of them just wanted to do the right thing. Phifer's character also has a speech in which he tells Rhames his concerns regarding the birth of his child that is briefly moving. The action is intense, the zombies are very bloodthirsty, and the story flows well for the most part.My few complaints are that I thought Polley's character was under-developed. I also felt that there were a few slow spots in the movie that seemed to be there just to waste time. Also, some of the characters (notably the girl with the dog, the young security guard, and the snobby guy with the boat) are extremely annoying and for the most part serve no real purpose in the film.Overall, I was impressed. I typically hate most of the contemporary horror movies (from the last 10 years or so) that seem to have terrible storylines, horrible dialogue, etc. I was pleasantly surprised awhile back with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and I was pleasantly surprised with the new Dawn of the Dead. Hopefully, filmmakers will take a note from these two movies and make GOOD horror movies.7 out of 10",Dawn of the Dead
451,owlman-1,my hatred for this film burns from the fiery pits of hell,1,14 April 2004,"Zombie review #1
*Possible Spoilers (but if you're smart you WON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS RUBBISH*So yeah, I was pretty disappointed by this film, and my expectations weren't really all that high to begin with.  At most I thought I'd get a cheesy but enjoyable action movie (I'd already resigned myself to the fact that this wasn't going to be a real zombie flick), but this film completely failed to live up even to that limited standard.There's so much to drone on about what's wrong with this wretched botch job that I may as well start with what I DID like:  The first ten minutes - fantastic, as good a bit of cinematic chaos as anyone's ever pulled off. And there's some nifty business near the end with a chainsaw and a car park that's full of 100s of zombies.  This scene almost threatens to save the film but sadly the zombie apocalypse a few brief shots promise never comes. It's like seeing a porn film that offers the merest glimpse of the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, then cuts to a ten minute sequence of boring, annoying people doing nothing but bore and annoy you - and then it ends.Zombie films are a lot like porn in some ways - the basic ingredients write themselves, and it's quite hard to completely screw it up, even on a limited budget.  Even the really bad old Zombie films have some entertainment value (ie: zombies eating people and shambling about to terrible synth music) but this film doesn't include ANY of the staples of the genre.  Not one scene of a character having their innards/brains exposed and eaten, not one scene of zombies losing limbs but THEY STILL KEEP COMING COS THEY'RE THE LIVING DEAD AND THEY DON'T NEED NO ANKLES!!!!   HAVE THESE PEOPLE NO RESPECT FOR THE CLASSICS?  They even have a dog in the film and never it have it a) have a fight with zombies or b) be a ZOMBIE DOG!!  Talk about your missed opportunities.Pah, and I haven't even started on the poor dialogue and characterisation (it's true zombie films don't exactly have a good track record for this, but this is meant to be Dawn of the Dead right?), crummy ""action"" scenes that substitute the good ol' shaking camera for any real tension or thrills, the crass use of rock music, the fact that every single ""shock"" in the film is so damned cheap (she's not just a zombie, she's a fat ugly old zombie OOOOOOOOH) and then there's the complete lack of regard for the original film, the characters in this film, and hey, the intelligence of the audience!   It's the triple wammy!Trust me here, I haven't even scratched the surface of what I hated about this film, but several of the other points have been made in some other reviews (although I will mention this one - what on earth is the point in the muslims glimpsed in the opening credits? To show it's a ""worldwide phenomenon""?? HOW?? All you see is people praying in a mosque, which, and I don't mean to scare any of you with this idea, could even be in the good old U.S of A, and there are no other nationalities shown in the sequence. Seems more like another cheap shot - show a clip of something some people are presently afraid of to try and get them jumpy cos there's nothing in the film that can do the job on it's own merits)This is the without a doubt the most worthless cinema experience I've ever had and that includes Superman 4, Police Academy 5 and Alien Resurrection, and is the first time I've ever felt like walking out of a film because I was literally chewing my fist in frustration at the mind numbing dreck taking place in front of my poor, suffering eyes.To sum up - this is a horror film that has a scene where a zombie woman gives birth to a zombie baby that is neither scary, disturbing, disgusting or even funny.  AND EXACTLY WHAT'S THE POINT IN THAT?????",Dawn of the Dead
452,Fightinggoat7,Dawn of the freakin' amazing,10,5 July 2004,"OK I saw this movie in theaters and I already new it would be good but I walked out of the theater thinking ""O my gosh that was the best film I had ever seen. The way the characters interact for example first they all act like complete strangers to each other then as time passes become like a family. As the story goes on the characters learn to deal with the fact that if they go out side they will become someones lunch and so like real people they try to continue life while knowing this. And the action is done in such a realistic manner that the characters seem real. For example some characters who don't use guns in their everyday life have trouble shooting at first then as time passes and they have practice with said guns their shooting skills have gotten better. And for the ones who use guns all the time they also improve on there shooting but start out good already. This film also has funny bits to break the tension and it is very welcome and at times laugh-out-loud funny.

453,Joy_Ride_74,My Take,10,14 August 2007,"I thought the movie was excellent! I didn't really care for the 1978 original. Sorry! This 2004 remake was full of action, surprises, and a bit of humor here and there. The only part that I found to be really stupid was where Sarah Polley's character, Anna, SAW what happened to her husband, but said absolutely nothing to the rest of the gang about it until the next day or two. How dumb? It wasn't difficult to figure out. She saw the condition of ""Vivian"" the little girl who lived on her street, and she saw what Vivian did to her husband, Louis. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that he died and then ""came back"" due to the bite from the little girl. I just didn't like the way they had Anna so closed-mouth and clueless about how the ""sickness"" spreads until darn near the end. Also, it would have been a nice touch for them to go a little in depth about HOW the ""Zombie-Virus"" started. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie and I've watched it at least a million times!",Dawn of the Dead
454,IAjhawk,Better than the 1st I think so,9,23 November 2008,"Dawn of Dead (remake) 9/10 This is the type of fast pacing movie makes it enjoyable film to watch with your buds. The beginning of this film is perfect for a zombie film. Gets you right in the action and never ends. There is more characters in this remake and having the gun shop owner across the mall made it even more enjoyable. The zombies have great special effects and the struggle of escaping the zombies being the strongest point of the movie. Least favorite points: baby zombie.... cool but not necessary I see where the idea would come from when the original was made the female lead was preagnet. I guess director wanted to show how it be if the baby turn into a zombie. Favorite Part: setting, pacing, the buses, endingRecommendation: Don't ever watch this film alone. I think it is more enjoyable with a group. So I would not own this film, but what horror movie is worth owning. If you think this is a scary and suspenseful film not for you.",Dawn of the Dead

456,fuzileer,A well made remake.,8,2 February 2007,"PREDICTION:""There's gonna be gore everywhere! Limbs torn off and blood running like a tap from freshly torn skin!PERFORMANCE:At the end of the film, I still had no idea what names the characters were. (Except C.J., easy name to remember!) Sarah Polley (ain't been in any good films apart from this one) who plays Ana, main female character, was not a very convincing performance, if i'm to be honest. Maybe the director (Zack Snyder, directed jack all before this) told her to show hardly any facial expression, but any way, she looks expressionless for most of the film. Ving Rhames (Mission: Impossible II) who plays the policeman, Kenneth, is the stereo-typical beefy black guy who acts hard and protects everyone with his macho ideas and muscle and Shotgun. Not original, but it was bound to turn up. The rest of the cast deliver a good performance, not many errors in their acting, and, hell, you actually feel sorry for the odd guy who gets eaten alive or blows himself up.BASIC STORYLINE:Okay, a woman who you don't care about called Ana (Sarah Polley) wakes up, sees her husband get a piece of his neck ripped off by a little girl (WANG-KER!!!!!111 OWNED BY A GIRL!!111) and then attacks her. She runs away and bumps into ""Look at me, I'm hard"" Kenneth (Ving Rhames) and three other people including a pregnant lady and her boyfriend. They go into a shopping mall to hide and are taken prisoner by three losers who work there. They get tied up, then they rebel, the capturers are tied up and then a truck of new characters enter the building. A fat woman turns zombie and they kill it and then they start shopping. Soon they all begin to die, a granny shoots the pregnant lady who turns out to be a zombie, the husband pulls out the baby from the womb, it is a zombie baby, granny shoots him, he shoots granny, baby gets shot, zombies break in, people panic. They get in car. Half of them die. A woman gets a chainsaw in her shoulder by a pensioner, he dies of a heart attack. Then CJ laughs and blows himself up. Then everyone gets on a boat, sails to an island and we are left thinking, WTF???!111111 as the credits show that the island is infested with the undead.Get it?CONCLUSION:Okay, the movie is not as confusing as that. I just couldn't be bothered to go so deep into it. Its 10:40 in the evening here... But anyway, it is a laugh to watch, better than 28 days later, miles better. By 28 times...Screw this, I'm going to bed.",Dawn of the Dead

He managed to satiate the most rabid gorehound while also appeal to intellectuals with satire on consumer culture.  The remake hasn't the wit or inclination to do anything but reduce the original's idea to a show-off visual style and cheap set pieces.  The opening 10 minutes has been justifiably celebrated, but the cliches then start piling up nearly as high as the body count.  I detested the entire pregnancy angle because of its illogical loop to introduce characters only to dispose of them (including a zombie baby).  I'd expect that in some cheapjack slasher movie, but we're dealing with a classic, for crying out loud.  This new version, with its hyperactive attitude, may win over modern viewers, but will never stand the test of time.",Dawn of the Dead

461,dsd_uk,Look mum I'm a Zombie....,8,12 April 2004,"I was a bit sceptical about this when I first heard about it as remakes are usually something that I look down upon as I feel they are just aimed at the mainstream critters who have never heard of the original and they are a good cash in for the director and cast as they are digging up old material and adding there flavour to it to make some kind of improvement over the original.Never the less despite Hollywood's absorbent cash in I was pleasantly surprised and entertained by the whole ordeal. This movie gets straight to the point and lets the zombie carnations out to play within the first five minutes of the film. One thing however, what's with all the fast zombies in movies at the moment? i.e. 28 days later, Chill out a bit will ya, what's wrong with sticking to traditions, zombies are slow, like a snail...a handicapped snail infact.Ving Rhames as a cop? Not so sure about that. I liked Michael Kelly's character development as CJ and Sarah Polley (Ana) as the star of the show is very convincing here, it was also good to see Tom Savini making a nice little cameo here. The ending could trouble some people but I felt that it was a fair establishment. Many will have natural hate in there blood at the thought of a remake of Romero's classic, naturally the film doesn't beat the original but compared to many modern day remakes I'll let this one off, now sleep my friends sleep.",Dawn of the Dead
462,vicvolta,Remake? Update!,8,28 June 2004,"Since I've been a zombie-slasher-movie-freak for the last 15 yrs I was highly anticipating the premiere of the remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead. Twenty-six years has past since the original was made and horror-film making has certainly moved ahead. This is not only visible in the effects section but also in the way the remake is directed, shot and edited. The 2003-version is a fast-paced, in your face type film and the coolest thing about it is that its gruesome without really focusing on the gore, like in many other ""zombie"" films. This version isn't always as true to the original as many other remakes of other films are but thats just adds to the movies better sides. A remake is supposed to be an update. And thats just what this is. Not always true to the original, but true to the genre and evolution.This remake of ""DOTD"" is in my point of view one of the best ""horror"" movies I've seen in the last one or two years. Its not pretentious like many other films in this genre is. Its just a cool horror movie. And please stay and watch the end titles! I would have to give this film **** out of 5.",Dawn of the Dead

The similarities I noted in this film to the original are as follows; 1. The Title 2. Zombies 3. Survivors stuck in a mall.Not only is the movie unique from the original, but it's not close to bad. Many of the scenes become incredibly tense, and the cast of characters don't make terrible decisions that would get them killed, like in so many other modern horrors. The ending was a little bit of a stretch, but the characters felt very real, for the most part, and the dialog and acting were quite good. Make sure to stay for the credits, too. There's not so much a secret scene after them, as there are a variety of scenes during, which were surprisingly disturbing. Far exceeded my expectations. 9/10",Dawn of the Dead

My issues are that the people in the mall weren't in there long enough for the the condition of many of the corpses around the building and in the parking garage. Then there's the generators for the mall that can't work as long with the load those people seemed to be using. Also, why did Luda take forever to die when everyone else died within hours? What happened to Andy's attacker(s).They didn't leave the gun shop, yet they weren't present in the shop either. Just some nitpicking gaps that made it a bit hard to swallow as zombie movies go. We won't even go anywhere near the fact that they don't even attempt to provide even the slightest clue of what caused this tragedy in any way, shape, or form.

There are more characters and most of which are very well developed that you grow to like them or hate them. The story is presence and clear, This movie is also extremely fast paced. From start to finish not a boring second exists. The action is raw and excellent, the gore effects are outstanding and realisitc and there are plenty of clever wise cracks and non-cliche' dialogue that mixes in very well. Hopefully their will be a Unrated version in time. Even if you are against remakes of classic films don't be discouraged this film will stand strong for a long long time. Also be on the look out for some characters from the original in cameo roles. 10 out 10",Dawn of the Dead
466,sam_loomis86,Excellent zombie film when it isn't compared to the original,8,15 April 2004,"I went to see 'Dawn of the Dead' in the theaters even though the original masterpiece by George Romero is my favorite zombie movie of all time. I had to say I was more than pleased with the overall product, sure the plot flatlines when compared to Romero's satirical script from the original film, but this one delivers in all accounts. The gore is there, even though it isnt as hardcore as the original's but this film is rated R. The zombie action is there and it hits hard!!, also the characters had such a cool chemistry that I really cared for more than one of them.I have to say that this is an excellent zombie film, and it works on every level. Of course, the title 'Dawn of the Dead' makes a lot of people compare it to the original film, I don't blame them at all. I just didn't care for the connection with the original masterpiece. Remake or not, this film delivered.",Dawn of the Dead
467,veracious_lies,The One Zombie Film to Watch,9,20 April 2006,"I'm not into zombie flicks, at all. I fell asleep during Night of the Living Dead. I dislike horror to a certain extent, too. But I'm so glad my zombie flick & horror fiend friend recommended this film to me, truly. I can even call it one of my favorite films.It's a very character-based and focused film. This is not a bad thing, at all, it's what makes and shapes the film and it's the one thing that makes it stand out over all other zombie flicks. In my opinion it's what makes it superior. You get to know the characters, you live with them, you fear with them, you laugh with them.. It's almost as if you're one of them - that's the mood every horror film hopes to reach but often fail to.The acting performances are good and even the tiny bit of romance works in the context of the film really well. The special effects, especially the fast moving zombies are fantastically made and just awesome to watch.The ending hurts because you really truly learn to like and enjoy the characters when you watch this film. At least I did. But still, at least you know you just saw a good film, when a film grabs hold of you like that.",Dawn of the Dead
468,WeeBey,Intense,9,25 March 2004,"I am a huge fan of Romero's Dead movies and I must say this movie gets my full approval. I was completely hooked from the beginning. The fact that the whole movie was shot in my hometown also added a lot of enjoyment to the movie, the beginning sequence looked like it was happening in my neighborhood, which was really cool.  The idea of running zombies made me hesitant at first, but they served the story well.  The only complaint I would have is I wish it were longer, and I was expecting a biker gang to crash the mall, but those complaints are very minor.  Solid movie from start to finish, don't miss it in theatres.  I'm very interested to see how the new resident evil will compare to this.",Dawn of the Dead
469,Cliche_Guevara,"Not that bad, actually",7,30 December 2004,"First of all, I would like to say that I saw this before I saw the Romero version. Now with that out of the way, I think that despite the fact that nearly all satire is gone from this film, it was still very good, the first fifteen minutes of the film were awesome, by itself it could have been a very, very good short film, but then the credits ended and the film got slightly worser and worser as it went along. The acting was not that bad, even though a lot of the dialog was immensely cheesy, mostly due to Ving Rhames, nearly no character development, except for the main security guard. The zombies were very impressive, but on the topic of zombies, they were fast, I'm not a fan of fast zombies, but maybe because I really love old-school zombie movies. But the main thing here that I did not like was that there are about Seven or Eight people in the mall this time, unlike in the original where there is four, giving very little times to really know most of the characters. But in the end it is still a better-than-average zombie movies. Not anywhere near as good as the original but still good.7/10",Dawn of the Dead
470,judasfm,Good zombie viewing (in more ways than one),6,23 July 2005,"Okay. Maybe I've become too jaded to horror films (unlikely; I tend to jump at the same point several times in a row) but I really don't get what's so great about this movie.Point one. Fast running zombies just don't work for me. This movie should have been called Dawn of the Psychos (or Demented, if you want to stick with the alliteration theme) That could have worked; a bunch of lunatics running around trying to carve people up would probably have gotten me on the edge of my seat. To be honest, half the time I forgot these guys were supposed to be dead until I got a close up. Zombies that move slowly and seemingly unstoppably creep me out far more than ones that run around like hamsters on caffeine. To make a comparison, it's like the shower scene in Psycho; part of the reason that's so sinister is because of the slow, deliberate movements right up until the knife flashes down. If he'd rushed in, yanked the curtain off and killed her in about three seconds, it wouldn't have been nearly so nerve-racking. Same goes for here. There's nothing truly scary about a zombie that races around.Point two. The suspense for me was almost non-existent, as was the character development. Basically, people need to care about characters in order to worry about whether or not the zombies/aliens/vampires/insert bad guy here will get them. Character development here was so lax that I honestly didn't care whether or not the people lived or died. End result, almost no suspense. I think the dog got better character development overall than the humans.There were a couple of good bits; the communicating between the two groups on the rooftops was good, and the end credits sequence (watch it and you'll see what I mean) I was on the edge of my seat far more with those credits than the rest of the movie.Don't get me wrong. I liked Dawn of the Dead; it's a fun film to zombie with (pun intended ;)) I just don't get why everyone was raving about it. It's worth a watch if you like horror flicks and if you have a spare couple of hours, but don't rush to buy it.",Dawn of the Dead
471,ITTMovieFanatic,Great remake!,9,18 July 2004,"The 1978 version of George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" was an extremely gruesome film about zombies invading a shopping mall. This of course was the sequel to Romero's 1968 B&W cult classic ""Night of the Living Dead"". Both movies were very good in a series that would eventually end with the final film of the series, 1985's ""Day of the Dead"", which couldn't equal the first two films. Then in 1990 came the awful remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"", a movie so bad because it was almost the exact same movie as the original (except that it was in color). Now the second movie in the zombie series has been remade, and was a surprise! I actually liked this new version better than the original 1978 film.The 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" pretty much has the same plotline as the earlier movie (zombies roam the countryside, and several survivors barricade themselves in a shopping mall), but unlike the ""Night of the Living Dead"" remake, this one isn't exactly the same as the 1978 version. This newer version is different. Here are three comparisons between the two films. 1) The zombies in the 1978 film moved slow; in the 2004 film they move faster. 2) Only four survivors barricaded themselves in the shopping mall in the original movie; there are more than four people who become trapped in the mall in the remake. 3) The human villains in the original were a motorcycle gang; the human villains in the remake are the shopping mall's security guards. I could go on and on about this all day, but let's move on to the other aspects of the film.This new version has better actors than the original. The original movie had pretty much unknown actors in the principal roles, but the remake has a couple of familiar faces. Sarah Polley, who started out as a child actor in Terry Gilliam's 1989 fantasy ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" and then grew up in movies like 1999's ""GO"", is excellent as a young nurse who helps fight off the flesh-eating zombies. Ving Rhames is equally good as a cop also trying to fight for survival. Jake Weber (""U-571""), Mekhi Phifer (TV's ER), Kevin Zegers (the ""Air Bud"" films) and Matt Frewer (""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"") round out the exceptional cast. Zack Snyder directs from a screenplay by James Gunn, and Snyder made a movie remake that's better than the original (which is rare in the movie industry). There's plenty of gore, action, laughs, and good performances (not necessarily by everybody; there are a few supporting characters that I could have done without). If there was one thing that I disliked about the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"", it is the final credits sequence, which I thought was kind of ridiculous. And not to mention incompetently put together, which made it very distracting. But aside from that minor quibble, this is for the most part a terrific remake. And yes, it's very gruesome. 2004's ""Dawn of the Dead"" rocks!****1/2 (out of four)",Dawn of the Dead
472,rterrell2,Hard to veiw as a remake,9,11 October 2005,"I love this movie as I do the original Romero film. But I find it very hard to compare them. The original is a great horror satire that has some great laughs in it. But the ""remake"" is a fantastic horror/drama.I find it hard to call this film a remake because it only shares three things with the original.Title,zombies, and a mall. All the characters and plot are very much different. One think this should be viewed as it's own film and any die hard fan of Romero's classic should go in with an open mind.This movie has one of the greatest opening's of any horror film ever made. Puts you in a peaceful world for alittle while and then takes you to hell and just does not give an inch. Directing and acting all top notch on this one.",Dawn of the Dead
473,remo1659,Awesome zombie film.,10,17 July 2019,I loved the original so I was hoping this would be as good. This is one of my favorites of the genre. One of the only films I can say I was actually on the edge of my seat at the theater. Intense action. Good cast. Takes the original and gets even wilder with the introduction of fast zombies.

475,cyberman-38605,Best Zombie Movie Ever Made,10,7 August 2018,"This movie was incredible. Everything you want from a zombie flick is in this. Great, extreme gore, surprisingly good character development, and a solid storyline. Every scene is immensely enjoyable and come together to make a very scary, intense film. 10/10 (Director's Cut)",Dawn of the Dead
476,jouiskc,It was OK....but,5,15 December 2005,"First I want to point out that I have never seen the original Dawn of the Dead. The main reason for this is that zombie movies just are not my thing. I don't have anything against them, I just think that if you seen one you seen them all. Now I will give kudos to this movie for having one of the best opening acts that I can remember. The first ten minutes of the movie are excellent. Fast paced and shocking, it really gets you on the edge of your seat.However, we get past that and start introducing characters. I like Ving Rhames and you knew what you were going to get out of his character. Sarah Polley does a good job and Jake Weber is OK. But the other characters are annoying. In fact this is one of the main weaknesses of the movie. Not only are there too many characters, there are too many that you really could care less about. They are not only unbelievable(the character of CJ the most glaring) but they actually seem to drag the rest down with them.The second weakness is the middle of the movie. After a frantic first ten minutes, the movie grinds to a halt. Instead of using this down time to provide us with some exposition that actually would advance the movie's plot, we get a sequence of scenes of the cast frolicking in the mall. What happened to everyone? What was the government or military response? And frankly this leads to some unintentional plot holes. Am I to believe that a handful of common people can hole up in a mall seemingly indefinitely, while the highly skilled and trained military gets wiped out in a matter of days? And the much maligned baby scene/scenario is just pointless. What did the father think they were going to do? Keep a zombie and zombie baby around for them to munch on them? Speaking of that, aren't zombie supposed to be flesh eaters? If this is the case why are there so many. Surely some zombies were eating one another.Finally, the end of the movie is kind of a let down. Suddenly, though somewhat understandably they decide they need to escape to an island via a boat. And they decide to convert a couple of buses into tanks. OK so far. But then we decide we need to get the character across the street some food? Why not just wait until you make a run for it in the armored buses. And why does that dumb girl go and get the dog? And then why in the world do they feel compelled to rescue her? And how does CJ suddenly become one of the gang? I could go on and on. But the single most annoying part of the ending is what happens afterward embedded in the closing credits. After spending two hours mildly rooting for annoying people, I am rewarded for my time investment to discover that they get zombified anyway? What was the point then?In summary, a really good opening sequence is followed by a lot of yakking and pointless plot threads. The closing chase scene is OK, but by this time who cared. And the ""ending"" of the movie was just plain over the top. I was left with the feeling of why I bothered. If I ever see it on again I will make certain I catch the opening act, but will do something else with the next 90 minutes of my life.",Dawn of the Dead
477,RainofMagic,One of my favorite horror films.,9,20 August 2006,"I know it's very rare that a near all-around decent film comes out of this genre. Especially from it's sub genre (zombies). Almost from the start this film had a lot of decent fright sequences and especially gore. One of the beginning scenes where the little girl bites Anna (Sarah)'s husband still actually freaks me out a bit. I was actually a little surprised when I first watched this film. I've learned; after watching several horror films, to lower my standards a bit when judging them. They almost always have less drama, character development, and lower-grade acting then other movies. However, this is one movie that hits above average when it comes to horror films. It is a bit overly-gory sometimes, and the characters don't really have a whole lot of background or personality. Most of them simply get picked off after having a few scenes each. That was actually the main flaw I saw in this movie. Even the main characters have little development, other than being people that came to a city mall during the zombie crisis.The ending was rather interesting however. I mean the ending that continued even into the credits. It also seems to warrant a sequel as it's unsure if the last 4 characters survived or not.. I think I can safely say that this is one remake that at least lives up to, if not surpasses; the original. Making the zombies fast moving and slightly more intelligent than previous zombie movies was a good move in my opinion. It sort of reminded me of 28 Days Later in that aspect. The zombies are more frightening when they can actually catch someone on the run (and even keep up with moving cars!). Blood runs rampant in this movie, so it's definitely not for the weak of heart. It still remains to be one of my favorite horror movies, and an overall top-tier horror movie in my opinion.",Dawn of the Dead
478,LordElfstone,most overrated movie I've seen in years,3,14 August 2004,"I'm usually not far away with my personal grade from the IMDb rankings, but this time I must object. This movie got everything wrong that I could possibly imagine except camera work and special effects, including plenty of gore like you should expect.LOADS OF SPOILERS ARE FOLLOWING... BEWARE!The characters are a bunch of every type in the book. You got the black cop leading the pack with matching lines. You got a jerk who introduces himself as one and stays one till he dies as a zombie (with a smile on the heroine's face, of course) and a more ruthless jerk (being an armed security guy) who does a complete character flip-flop for no obvious reason - if you don't count the fascination about the sudden topic of the hour: TRUST You got a romance without a chance (another twist you can see coming from a mile away) between a nurse-turned-heroine and a TV-salesman keeping the cool head among them and a baby being born from a zombie in a situation that's both stupid and a rip-off from several movies at once.Most of the scares - or non-scares - are obvious. This could vary if you didn't watch many horror movies. The movie takes away the scare-factor by mocking various other flicks and itself. But this is not supposed to be a parody, is it? You can even guess quite a few dialog lines, mostly involving CJ who is nice as soon as he notices that there's another one who can play the I'm-a-dick part, therefore he creates comic relief instead. This movie is more action than horror, after all. The last part turns into a shoot-out and barbecue. By now nothing could scare you, anyway. The chainsaw reduces the survivors to our chosen few. The ending is surprising, as usual.END OF SPOILERSIt's a bad movie that just looks good. It started well and got worse from there. I liked the idea with the other guy on the roof of the gun shop. In these moments the movie was actually funny without being silly and delivering cheap laughs through predictable dialog. I rate it 3/10, just because I've never done this before.",Dawn of the Dead
479,redeyethug187,not the same and just cheap,1,18 July 2007,this movie is not better than the original the best is that one this one is kind of lame because it does not follow the same formula it just kind of uses people who we never know about or even want to care about it puts a whole bunch of people in a room some we know and some we don't and after a while we don't even care about any of the other survivors other than the main characters because every one else is just there to make a cast and have no point in being there at all I read a comment where one person thinks this is a lot better well he is a moron Iguz59 or something well he does not know anything about movies so do not listen to him. all in all this movie has no effect as the original the girl was not as bitchy as this one and the characters were not this stupid and the original somebody actually survived not everyone in the mall by plane not a damn boat so this remake is made really bad.,Dawn of the Dead
480,ccjuggalo69,boo,1,20 March 2004,"I am an ENORMOUS fan of horror movies.  They are by far my favorite genre of film.  This movie was so insanely boring, I almost fell asleep.  I know you are not supposed to take these films seriously, and I never do, I found 'The Exorcist' to be a barrel of laughs, and I was expecting a similar reaction to this film.  Well, I did not get it at all, except for like the first 15 minutes or so, when I was in stiches.  The remaining hour and a half or so, I was just waiting for it to end.  There is a period of about an hour in the film where absolutely nothing happens.  A group of survivors hole up in a shopping mall to keep safe, and uhhh well that's your movie folks.  Nothing happens from that point on, until the end.  This movie is nowhere near as consistent or as exciting as last years '28 Days Later.""  I also accept that these movies are not supposed to be realistic at all, I reinforce they are my FAVORITE films, but I somewhat expect them to be consistent.  You have some charaters who get bit, and turn into zombies within minutes, and others who take hours or days to turn.  Completely inconsistent, and it got a bit annoying.  Anyhow, go see it, if you must, hopefully you will get more enjoyment out of it than me.  But if you truly want to go to the movies, and see something funny, 'Starsky and Hutch' is still out there.",Dawn of the Dead
481,mag7_1,So dissapointing!!!!!,3,20 March 2004,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** First off; let me begin by saying that I have NOT seen the original 1978 version of this movie. So therefore when myself and a friend decided on the spur of the moment to go see this flick...it was with only the basic knowledge that it was a ""zombie movie""....where folks are in a mall. After sitting through this movie....I felt as if it had been an almost entire waste of time!!!!! I will break down the reasons why I believed so.1. I absolutely despise movies where s*** just starts happening and there is never any definitive answer as to why they have begun....at least on the original Night Of The Living Dead....they gave some vague reasoning as to what started the dead to rising!!! This movie is normal...and then suddenly total chaos!!!!
2.Absolutely no background information on any of the characters to amount to much except for the Rhames character....com'on...how are we supposed to feel for these people that were just thrown at us????
3.The pregnant chick thing....was just stupid!!!! 4 minutes into the movie...myself and everyone....in the theatre...knew she was gonna be birthing....the spawn of the dead...and then that baby looked like a combination of the babies from....""Its Alive"" and ""Basket Case""(Yes I know the latter wasn't actually a baby). It was so totally ridiculous!!!!!
4.The dude that stayed on the dock at the end as the boat sailed away....was the most obnoxious....piece of crap I've ever seen....and his character.....was a waste!!!!
5.There was just so much more they could have done with this movie....it was if the producers had borrowed the mall...and had to finish as quickly as possible with their shooting schedule..hehehe.
6.The scenes where everyone suddenly got jolly...and started having a good time and kidding around for a few frames made no sense!!!!!
7.Why were they in such a hurry to get out of the mall?....this was obviously one of the few places on earth that they could reamin relatively safe....hell;watch a video...or something....hehehe.
8.And last...(but, definately not least)....I have absolutely had it with the the ""Blair Witch Style"" endings...give it a  break guys!!!! That s*** was 5 years ago(Blair Witch)....it worked then.....and it is very old now!!!! First the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre did it...and now this crap!!!! The final scene should have just ended with the boat sailing off to nowhere...and not with ""Island cannibals"" devouring....everyone...during the credits....This scene was seen by less than 50% of the people at the theatre I was at...because once they saw the credits rolling...the movie sucked so badly...they were up....and out of there...before they even realized there were ""more scenes""!!!!!!
7. And another thing...that stupidchick that went and got the dog...would have just been one stupid dead girl!!!! I like animals as much as the next guy....but, to people that put them(animals) on the same level as human beings....then ...die with them...she knew the dog would be fine(The Zombies showed no interest...in the dog...when it ran across the mall parking lot).
The movie had a few redeeming qualities...and they were.
1.Ving Rhames turned in a powerful performance(as he does in everything he is in)...He is the most talented African-American actor currently on Hollywood payroll. His character...was very impressive...and they even gave us some hindsight as to who his character may have been.
2.One very awesome soundtrack!!!! I have got to have that opening....song(Sung during the TV mayhem....right before and during the opening credits of the movie)....it sounded like Johnny Cash...if anyone knows what this song is...please let me know.
3.The scene where they were having the dude across the way....shoot celebrity look-a-likes in the mall parking lot...was absolutely hilarious!!!! Loved it....
4.The CJ character(head of security)...became very interesting once he began working in support of the group.
Also; noticed the co-pilot from Jason X's spaceship...on the movie...he is cool.
But, all in all these few things weren't enough to save this less than mediocre...movie....I give it a 3 out of a possible 10 points.
I now plan to go out...and rent the original....and see the differences....my girlfriind says she saw the original when it came out in 1978 and that it was very good....we'll see.",Dawn of the Dead
482,primo-st,"Does it's job, but lacks the attributes of the greats.",6,11 April 2011,"For a fair review I will disregard the original completely, and focus only on the 2004 production.I watched this because I felt like a zombie apocalypse movie.And that is exactly what I got. The same ageless zombie formula is used in Dawn of the Dead. A group of survivors have holed up in a mall, and desperately try to survive a onslaught of mindless undead cannibals.My main issue with the movie was that it doesn't really offer anything new. The survivors as in all zombie movies are a politically correct group, including African Americans,a Latino, and ample spread of women. That I have no issue with, producers don't really have a choice than to provide to a broad audience. What I had an issue with was the fact that 30 seconds after meeting each character you can literally predict their chances of survival and time of death. If your watching a horror movie, the most fun thing to do is to go 'shes gonna die next', 'hes got no hope' etc but in Dawn of the Dead, the shallow formula based characters offer 0% chance of a plot twist.The acting, its okay. I didn't think any particular performance was outstanding, many being particularly weak such as Lindy Booth, whose character loses her whole family, but within days has found herself a love interest (Kevin Zegers, also a fairly poor performance) and an incomprehensible, irrational attachment to a dog.What brings this movie to a 6 rather than lower was the fantastic and creative friendship through whiteboard diagrams on top of the roof of the mall with Kenneth, the heroic religious policeman (who unfortunately has an unexplained background) and'Andy' the gunstore owner stranded a mile a away. I enjoyed the comedic relief, its a nice break from movies like '28 days later', where you actually need to take a minute for recovery after every scene.Other than that the movie is completely forgettable, but your attention span will be kept, and it should sate your bloodlust for a fun (and not particularly scary) zombie apocalypse movie.",Dawn of the Dead
483,davidcurtis_5,Scary scary film,7,20 March 2004,"Wow I went to see this at a special preview last night and it realy scared me and believe me ive seen a lot of horror movies. As a fan of the original movie I was expecting a soso remake with a few chills along the vein of resident evil. But what I didnt expect was to be jumping out of my skin at every sound and peeking through my fingers every 5 mins ,you may think im just a wimp but honestly it takes a lot to scare me and this is one of the only films that has managed to do so in a while, the other being Dark Water which i also recommend. I do feel  I need to say that I dont realy think that this should be classed as a remake as its very different from the original the mall is there but thats about it, its also closer in tone to something like 28 days later. I think that its not lacking when you compare it to the original because its different, where the original to me had an epic feel that was chilling as you realy felt that the problem was not just contained to the people in the mall, this movie was more action led and I felt that it focoused more on the characters we saw I didnt feel that there was a world outside that was ravaged by zombies. I also thought that a few of the characters in the remake were just there for fodder and had no real purpose as they were not developed.

Just what makes Dawn of the dead memorable? i can answer that. nothing.Its the sort of film you get up from and think, huh, could have done something better but ah well.A good time to watch this film would probably when your bored out of your mind, cause, despite its flaws, there scenes that make you think 'that was actually worth the wait'so, overall, its a film, if you like films, watch it, if you don't like films, don't. that's all its boils down to really.6.5 out of 10 for me. and that might be me being a bit harsh on it.",Dawn of the Dead

487,haxboob,why oh why do we pay taxes?,9,22 March 2004,"I didn't really think this film would affect me this much but I found myself thinking about an exit strategy IN CASE we ever get invaded by zombies. Sad isn't it? The film makers succeeded in doing their job. They give blood, gore and thought provoking situations to confront yourself with. If you don't take life too seriously and haven't become too jaded by life then you'll enjoy yourself and leave asking ""what would I do in this situation?"" and laugh about all the nasty stuff you just saw with your friends. If you ARE that over serious, hard-to-please type then you'll leave the theater asking ""why did I just waste my money on THAT?"" like the sour-puss walking out of the theater next to me. He was thankfully the only one who didn't enjoy himself and his friends told him to shut up and mellow out when he became The-Director-Who-Could-Have-Done-a- Better-Job, we all know that guy unfortunately. The beginning of the film before the credits rolled got the audience to clap and cheer, it was just that exciting and brutal. Civilization at the very moment of collapse, the point where 911 fails, police and paramedics just can't do their jobs anymore and our main characters are left to jump in their car and floor it to safety. Excellent fun. If you want a possible happy ending, LEAVE when the final credits start. If you stay through the credits you'll be left with a sad, disturbing ending which I was not happy with because I just wanted everyone to finally be safe, and thats not what happens. If it were me on that boat I would have.....",Dawn of the Dead
488,shaolinstylin,ugh,1,4 July 2012,"Somehow or another, when every other 2000-something remake of an old horror movie set off most horror purists' ""Hollywood BS"" alarms, this one managed to sneak under them. The irony is that this might be the worst of the lot, as well as the most insulting considering the original's incisive anti-consumerism subtext.Zack Snyder's directing style is everything soulless, overproduced and superficial about Hollywood regurgitated and dumbed down 10 times over, left in the freezer for a year and microwaved. Who needs grisly and grainy when everything can be shot super-clean and ""sexy"" like an MTV music video? Ah, the art of missing the point.The running zombies are stupid. I don't care about or want realism in my walking corpse movies, but turning zombies into athletic killers affects something fundamental: fear. With slow but savage, drone-like enemies, you get a sense of hope, and your mind starts mapping things out. Conversely, when everything starts falling apart, there's genuine panic, balanced and exacerbated by a faint possibility of survival. When the characters are surrounded by a thousand leopard-fast killing machines, there is no hope, so you don't care what happens, thus, there is no fear. More importantly, though, the characters are cardboard cutouts. To top it off, when the movie ends and the credits roll, we get nu-metal. The cycle of 13 year old appeal is complete.Horrible.",Dawn of the Dead
489,horrorfan_86,One of the best zombie movies ever,9,18 January 2005,"Out of all the horror movies I have bought this year, dawn of the dead is by far my favorite. I don't know if you could really classify dawn of the dead as a straight up horror movie, because it isn't scary. It is more of a suspenseful action movie if anything. The the makeup for the zombie's in the movie are so believable. I watched the special features for the DVD and they used people with real hadicaps as the zombies without arms or legs. The camera work looks like it is done with a hand held camera, you it puts you right in the middle of the action. Their is also enough blood, gore, and violence to satisfy both action and horror fans. The movie also does a great job of how people can turn on each other so quickly in times of crisis. Overall, i give this movie a 9 1/2.",Dawn of the Dead

Where as the original, on the other hand, I have seen at least 30 times and I love it every time. It's seems movies with underlying, yet obvious, motives are far more entertaining than straight action. This is also true of the brilliant 28 Days Later, although in a different, less humorous way. This by no means implies that I don't enjoy or like the film, it just doesn't hold a candle to the original. But then again, no one expected it to, it's probably the best remake in a long time, since it went for something different.",Dawn of the Dead

Fans of blood, guts, desperate survivors and apocalyptic situations will be glad to know that Dawn of the Dead jumps straight into the action, with neither complicated technobabble nor a long-winded back-story. The actors - who look closer to actual people than the air-brushed clones so frequently seen in other movies - are convincing and engaging as the few survivors holed up in a local shopping mall while zombies roam the streets. Rather than hiding the delightful and clearly expensive special effects in shrouds of colorless gloom, this movie has both bright sunlight and dark, tense moments. Viewers will remain enthralled as the initial fleeing from the zombies gives way to plans, character conflicts and both happy and sad moments. All in all, a brilliant piece of work with a nightmare-like atmosphere.",Dawn of the Dead
492,jescho13,"When there is no more room in Hell, the dead will sprint the Earth. - Spoilers",7,22 March 2004,"I do not understand the idea of remaking good movies. I think I'll re-paint the Mona Lisa. Why not remake bad movies? Just think, a big budget remake of Plan Nine from Outer Space.  Then again, if you wash and polish a piece of crap, it's still going to be a piece of crap. Ignoring the fact that it is a remake, the new Dawn of the Dead is a good movie.  I would call it a gore filled action movie as opposed to a horror movie. It was not scary at all. 28 Days Later is more of an actual 'horror movie.' Not many modern horror movies are actually scary any more.  They have become so post-modern that it is almost impossible to have unique scares anymore.  The good thing about this movie is that it does not take it self seriously.  James Gunn set out to write a balls to the wall zombie movie and that is exactly what he did. It is obvious that he is a student of Lloyd Kaufmann.  The zombie baby scene is something right out of the Troma Universe.  It is obvious that Gunn is a big horror movie fan.  He knows all of the elements to throw into the mix, like the a*****e you hope gets killed, the comedic yet gruesome death scene, the 'getting and plan and preparing to kick ass scene,' and countless others.  He is the perfect person to write a 'horror' movie.I can do without the MTV style of editing in movies these days.  Dawn of the Dead is full of that and it gets annoying and confusing to a degree. The cinematography was great though.  It had that kind of grainy look that any horror movie should have. The picture also seemed to stay clear and focused while the camera was rapidly moving around too.   The new Dawn of the Dead is a treat for any zombie fan.  The whole argument that the zombies move too fast is just silly. There are no rules for zombies because they DON'T EXIST, so film makers can have them do whatever they want them to do. I think they are creepier when they are slow moving and lurking around, but who cares.The remake ignores the capitalist and consumer oriented society metaphors because they were already explored in the original.  That would have been crossing the line of remaking into just ripping off ideas.  Have fun and go see the remake. I'm sure Mr. Romero will forgive you.",Dawn of the Dead

I give it 8 of 10 cause it's a, i don't know what to say but it has this sense of entertainment which is really huge in this film. I'm telling everyone out there, See it!!! The movie is about this group which are hiding in a supermarket from a massive zombie-attack from the outside where the zombies are, and then someone dies and another and another... All the time these zombies are attacking them. In the supermarket where they are hiding is things happening all the time, like a man who is shooting at a zombie from the roof , but i'm warning you it's frightening.

494,Severance96,The intro and outro is the absolute best I have ever witnessed on the white screen!,8,30 June 2004,"Can a remake become a new era?This was the question I asked myself, when I'd finished watching the new remake of Dawn of the Dead. This movie was beyond all my expectations, and I can assure, that I actually had some pretty high thoughts about this remake.The original story is a masterpiece itself, and this new one, wasn't bad in any way. Rather the opposite, it had been remodeled and redone to fit the aspects of the time we are living in today. And I'm sure Romero is pleased with the new story.What surprised me the most was how god d**n beautiful this movie was. Every scene is like a masterpiece itself. The intro and outro is the absolute best I have ever witnessed on the white screen! I almost tried to brake into the projector room at the cinema to rewind the outro, just to watch it again.I can continue to write about how great this flick was, or i can sum it all up a bit.There are two things about Dawn of the Dead (2004), that made the biggest impact on me. no 1: The overall performance of the movie itself. no 2: The visual parts. Every scene just felt so perfect. The lighting, the environments, camera positioning, effects etc. Everything just felt like it had been trimmed to perfection!
But... Dawn of the Dead is not for everyone. My mom for instance wouldn't be able to understand what made this movie so great. It is still a hardcore zombie flick. Not like 28 days later or Resident Evil.
The only thing left to do, Is to hope that this movie is the beginning of a new Zombie Era!",Dawn of the Dead
495,ncfan,Edge-of-your-seat horror,8,29 June 2004,"Dawn of the DeadOne day, everything seems normal. Ana (Sarah Polley) is working overtime at the hospital, where she is following up a patient who was bitten. She finally finishes, goes home to her husband, and everything seems normal. When Ana and her husband wakes up, they find their next door neighbour's daughter standing at the doorway, ready to bounce. This in turns leads to the girl biting Ana's husband, who then tries to bite Ana. But of cause she misses by inches, and drives as far as she can go.Ana soon finds out that she is not the only survivor, after crashing her car. She soon meets up with: Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Michel (Jake Weber), Andre (Mekhi Phifer), and Luda (Inna Korobkina), who also have just survived a close encounter with the zombies. The survivors then head to the shopping centre to hide away from the flesh-eating zombies. As they wander about the shopping centre and find things which they can use, they encounter security guards: CJ (Michael Kelly), Terry (Kevin Zegers) and Bart (Michael Barry). They mean business. Also they let in other survivors who are also trying to defend themselves: Steve (Ty Burrell), Nicole (Lindy Booth), Norma (Jayne Eastwood), Tucker (Boyd Banks), plus others.So now, Ana and the other survivors must keep the zombies out of the shopping centre, so that they do not end up as flesh eating zombies.My opinion...I have not seen the original, so cannot compare the two. The movie was very scary at times, leaving me on the edge of my seat, and found myself tapping my feet and covering my mouth. The music helped with the atmosphere. I think that the comedic moments in the movie were well placed, and found myself giggling. There was one part in the movie which made my sister, myself and the rest of the cinema-goers gasp out loud. But this was soon followed by a faint laugh, thinking ""Did we just witness that? I can't believe it!"" The acting was pretty good, and I enjoyed watching the zombies. I never realized how slow that moved, but also at the same time, how fast they could move if they wanted to.If you enjoyed this movie, I would also recommend watching 28 Days Later.8/10",Dawn of the Dead
496,ZeldaFan2929,Now this is how remakes are done!,8,22 June 2007,"Ana (Sarah Polly) is a hard-working nurse; after countless hours of sleepless work she goes home to her normal suburban home to be with her husband. All seems well, life is great and everything is near-perfect. Randomly all of a sudden her neighbor's young daughter shows up ""not as herself"" and attacks her husband and before Ana knows it, her husband is a mindless being trying to kill her. She manages to escape and as she does, she witnesses total chaos as many people have become mindless flesh eaters as her husband has. As she tries to find someplace to go, she finds a police officer named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) and the two find more survivors and take refuge in a local shopping mall in ""Dawn of the Dead"", the 2004 remake of George A. Romero's 1978 horror classic.I like a few remakes, but quite a few are also complete garbage. Remakes of ""When a Stranger Calls"" and ""Black Christmas"" really suck where as others like ""Psycho"" and ""The Fog"" are at least mildly respectable. Classic '80's remakes such as ""The Thing"", ""The Fly"", and ""The Blob"" were great ones as was the recent ""King Kong"" remake, which I will say is definitely better than the original. 2004's remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a nice surprise as it seemed to have all the ingredients to make a remake good. It keeps the basic plot of the original with many little tributes to the original (such as Ken Foree of the original having a cameo restating the famous line ""When there's is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"") while being a very different movie at the same time. Even George A. Romero, who did the original said he thought this would suck but admitted that he kinda liked it. The biggest difference from the original is the zombies themselves; in the original (as well as ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Day of the Dead"", and ""Land of the Dead"") they were slow, brainless, and looked dead. The new zombies have normal complexion for the most part, run extremely fast, and are very aggressive. While the others are more or less ""classic"" zombies, these are probably scarier. Movies don't scare me but there was this one scene in a pitch-black parking garage that zombies eventually filled into was really intense. Also, there are quite a few characters in this one as opposed to the four in the first.Acting in this film is very good for the most part especially from leads Sarah Polly and Ving Rhames. Ving's character Kennith I'm assuming is named after actor Ken Foree who's character in the original (I think) was a police officer as well. Characters for the most part are likable and it is hard to see a lot of them die, though of course there or a few putrid ones who you can't wait to see get eaten. The movie is quite gruesome as you may have imagined; the only way to kill zombies to to shut down brain activity so there are plenty of exploding heads. Aside from that there is no actual ""gore"" in the film but there is plenty of blood, filmmakers were very generous in that department. It's not the greatest movie in the world but aside from the fact that it's not the original film there isn't much holding it back. I was kind of disappointed with the ending though. I apologize if you may consider this a spoiler but the endings of both versions of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" had sad endings but basically said that humanity will overcome this ordeal and this version ended like ""Day of the Dead"" saying that we're all screwed. I herd that Day of the Dead was depressing long before I saw it and it didn't ruin the movie for me so that is why I mention that. Both the original ""Day of the Dead"" and this remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" are still very good movies so I suggest you check them out.*Note that the only version of the film I saw was the Unrated Directors Cut, which has more gore and character development as the director says in the introduction on the DVD so I recommend that that is the version you see.The Breakdown: PROS: Excellent gore and special effects, plenty of bloodshed, good acting, a pretty creepy film, lots of depth in characters, cameos from a few members of the cast of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"", and is one of the better remakes out there. CONS: Zombies are complete opposites (fast, aggressive) from their Romero counterparts (slow, dumb) (this can be a pro or a con), a depressing conclusion, not quite as good as the 1978 original classic.OVERALL: The 2004's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is very well done as far as remakes go. It is a fairly creepy and very thrilling movie. If you can stomach the violence you should definitely check this out. It may not be the original but it has everything a good remake should have. I didn't expect to like it that much but I was very surprised.Unrated: Graphic Violence/Gore, Languege, an Sexuality; Runtime: 110 minutes; Score: 8/10",Dawn of the Dead
497,harcher,Good Zombie Flick Some Spoilers,8,26 March 2004,"I just finished watching this movie and thought it was a pretty good zombie flick.  I did not compare it to the original and did not find myself thinking of the original while watching this one.  IMHO it is a vastly different movie, which made it not tread on the original so...SpoilersThere are some very disturbing images in this movie for me, two in particular that will stay with me for a few days.  The first is when the female lead, Ana played by Sarah Polly, gets in her car and is escaping her rabid husband.  As she drives through her shattered neighborhood we see several zombie attacks on people who are mild shock at what they are seeing around them.  This really bothered me for some reason.  Shortly after this she pulls up behind a wrecked school bus and through the window of the bus we see two kid zombies attacking another kid, looks like a girl and she is fighting for her life but you know she is going to die.  This was another image that really bothered me.There were some really cool things too, like the van/car accident you see from above, really well done!  The zombies were well done and you get to see some interesting looking creature effects.  There is not the variations like we have seen in the original but, zombie clowns are a little weird anyway :-)  The zombies move fast here as in 28 days later and this makes them a much tougher monster than if they were slower.  I liked this but my friend who I saw the movie with did not, he argued for the slower zombie to buid drama.  I liked the camera work, particularly when they went to the grainy shots or with the action shots.  It made me feel much closer to the action and added to the 'holy crap they are everywhere' feeling of the movie.
Overall I would argue that if you like horror movies then you will enjoy this one.  I also really enjoyed the soundtrack.",Dawn of the Dead

499,themadhobbit,Recommended!,8,22 March 2004,"Saw it yesterday. WOW! I wasn't sure I would like ""fast"" zombies (haven't seen 28 Days Later yet - so won't compare). These zombies were SCARY. Well acted, well shot and the editing is good (not great). The story is about as good as it gets for a zombie flick. This version WORKS and it works VERY well. The Opening scene is creepy to the max and before the title, you are in no doubt of what is to follow.  Probably the best build up in a zombie flick yet. It begins with a ""normal"" day in the hospital for an everyday kind of nurse, Ana (Sarah Polley), but soon, the world is turned upside down and shaken. Ving Rhames, as Kenneth, is AWESOME and I actually felt RELIEVED when his character entered the picture. The acting is solid with performances by Jake Weber `Michael', Mekhi Phifer `Andre', Micahel Kelly `CJ', Bruce Bohne `Andy' and a bit part by Matt Frewer that is poignant and effective. I was impressed by the casting. I was immediately and easily able to suspend disbelief and accept the characters as `real'.  I do not expect character studies in these films, I expect sketches and fairly 2 dimensional attitudes. Kenneth, Michael and Andy were my favorite characters, but all of the `A' parts were well acted. What was REALLY nice to see is that they stayed away from the Survival Horror stereotype characters - perhaps even introducing new ones.  The characters responded `realistically' and ""logically"" to their situations (based on THEIR perspectives and perceived values.) Andy on the Gunshop was clever and a very interesting part of the story. While there are indeed some SHOCKS, I regret to say that they did ""pull some punches"".  While not as pornographically gory as the Italian Splatterflicks or even the original, there were definitely guts, blood and exploding heads.  But Private Ryan still holds the title for pure gore (I haven't seen the Passion yet).  This was disappointing because instead of an original zombie flick this was a remake of a classic, one that defined a genre.  To whimp out on the gore is nearly unforgivable. Also missing was the campiness of the original, though there are plenty of intentional humorous incidents to punctuate the horror.  Also gone are Romero's social commentaries.  This film isn't about society, it is about surviving the insane. The original holds a special place in my heart and I was VERY concerned about the remake - Hollywood has screwed up a lot of decent opportunities lately.  I am pleased to say that this film was ""done right"". Could it have been done better? Sure, but it will do as is, at least until the ""uncut"" version is released on DVD. BTW, I really liked Savini's remake of Night of the Living Dead and in many ways prefer it over the original.  Not that it is better, but I think it is better executed and I liked his spin. Therefore, since I liked the remakes of NotLD and DotD, then I actually look forward to and HOPE they remake Day of the Dead. The Mad Hobbit's rating:  ""See it now"".SPOILERS: Setting the stage with longshots of the city were AWESOME - a LOT to look at and just enough time to look, before we go back to action.  In the first long shot of the city, watch the lower center of the screen at first, before gazing at the rest - you will have time. The meeting of Ana and Kenneth was a bit contrived, but trust me, the movie quickly gets back on track. The intro of the mall brought a delighted giggle from me. The editing is a bit muddled at times, occasionally `skipping parts' that you need to mentally fill in, for instance how they gain entrance to the locked mall.  These are few, and easily ignored, but I couldn't help but wonder why the cuts were made. I wasn't fond of the change in how the dead are created.  Bite only seems to make it a virus, I always preferred the `we just don't know' explanation. A lot of people complained about the absence of `character' zombies, like> the Hare Krishnans, cheerleaders etc.  I actually didn't mind the loss, in fact it would have been distracting. I didn't like the whole dog storyline and thought that they pussied out by passing on some zombie dog possibilities. Also, when the girl `Nicole'(?) goes to 'rescue' the dog, not only did I groan at the cliché but I couldn't help wondering that if it was so easy for her to drive over to Andy's Gun Shop, why didn't they do it earlier? When they finally leave in the shuttles, I still am not sure why the second one crashed - I felt it was again `contrived' instead of `natural or logical'. BTW - do not jump up when credits roll, throughout the credits are glimpses of the REAL ending of the film.  Which is not only cool but raises ANOTHER gripe, and a reason why I can't rave as heartily about this film, we really don't get to SEE the zombies in this film. Oh, sure there a few obligatory scenes, but the glimpses in the end credits really had me wishing there had been MORE.",Dawn of the Dead
500,MisterCellophane,Devastating,10,11 January 2005,"This film is one of the most remarkable horror films I have even seen. Despite its origins, Dawn of the Dead 2004 never feels like ""merely"" a remake of a sequel: it feels like a totally new movie: it deserves a fresh approach, and comparisons with Romero's version are unnecessary.From harrowing, uneasy beginning to the devastatingly dark ending, the film is alive with plot and pace, with dialogue that really crackles and sounds like it's coming from characters rather than a clunky expositive screenplay. This last is particularly surprising in a zombie flick: it's a genre in which the best dialogue usually comes from the zombies themselves.Character development is taut but it is at least present. I especially liked Ana, the nurse who's given a split-second to realise what's going on, and she grabs the keys, and gets the hell out. CJ's transition from convincing, frustrating hard-case to team player is 100% genre, but he plays both so well that it's hard to fault. The isolated Andy cultivates a real warmth and I was just heartbroken when he meets his bitterly ironic end. Even the passive characters, the ones we just know are going to die, give us the impression that these are people we've only just met, rather than people who are waiting to die when they reach their allotted page in the screenplay. I certainly didn't want the trucker lady to die. In any case, up-against-it survival horror doesn't give much opportunity for long, complex character arcs: there isn't enough time, but the acting is so refined that the character moments always feel substantial, and we have the casting director to thank for that.The gore is visceral and convincing - though a few of the scares are a little over baked, particularly the zombie childbirth, torture to watch, for sure, but not as scary as it should be because we see it coming from miles off. However, these suspense less mis-steps pale when compared to the verve of the faster scares - The parking garage chase, the little girl at the beginning, the chainsaw through Nicole's arm in the bus, and so forth. The zombies themselves are horrific: fast, crazy, determined, and with incredibly creative and individual make-up effects.And the ending just destroyed me.",Dawn of the Dead
501,T850,was shaking my head through the entire film.,1,20 February 2005,"I LOVE horror films. And zombie films have a place in my heart, especially George Romero's zombie films. And when I heard of a remake of Dawn of Dead with Romero having a hand in it, I was excited. Finally a decent budget and modern day effects along with Romero's touch. Unfortinately I felt betrayed and very unsatisfied after the first 10 minutes of the movie. And sadly the rest of the movie followed suit. The only good thing if any in this film was thankfully the gore wasn't restrained, But that's the only decent thing about this film.What makes this film so bad? Well it follows the trend of movie 'remakes' which in reality are a totally different movie and using an existing title to get fans to watch. And unfortunately this was no different. The director simply had no respect for the original masterpiece of it's older namesake. It lacked everything that made the original so memorable and replaced them with cheap thrills, action sequences and annoying characters. I understand that it was Mr.Snyder's first time, But jeez he already had a base to go on and plenty of reference material. The Mall seemed to be there in name only, and the zombies where laughable rather scary.There's not enough space and time for me to explain every reason why this film was beyond disappointing. So I'll just summarize instead.First 'And foremost' the zombies. They ran, they climbed, they hissed and they made threatening faces at you. Wrong, very wrong and shouldn't even be called zombies. Romero understood what made the zombies so scary in the original 'Dead' movies. They were believable, and that's what made them scary. Because he realistically portrayed what a reanimated dead corpse would do. Their muscles where too rotted and stiff to move fast or do complicated movement, if at any. They were too stupid to speak or make facial threats at you. And they were relentless and numerous. They simply wouldn't stop and they were simply so many it was overwhelming. These aspects are what made Romero's zombies so scary, the 'remake' is completely devoid of all of that.Secondly was the overwhelming stupidity of all the characters, It's expect that a few of the characters in films such as these are supposed to be stupid. But in this case they all are and none of them give you a sense of loss, (infact quite the opposite) when they are finally dispatched. The only character I felt sorry for was the lone gun-shop owner, But his demise was all but predictable and on the whole, irrelevant. The rest of cast, you feel rather gratified when they meet their doom. In this film, The characters and the zombies have something in common, their IQ.Films like 28 days later and Return of the Living Dead I enjoyed, even though they feature what I described as (the first part at least) as Dawn 'remake''s failings. But neither of these films boasts or pretends to be on the same level of Romero's work. 28 Days Later is not a Zombie film per se, as the people weren't undead but diseased, so them running and screaming wasn't as far fetched. And 'Return' was more comedic and satirical in nature as well as it took a totally different path from Romero's 'Dead' movies, Dan O'Bannon made it abundantly clear that his movie had nothing to do with Romero's work or story lines. The 'Remake' however boasts about remaking a classic that carries the same name, this is where it becomes inexcusable.If at all possible, watch Romero's 1979 version of Dawn of the Dead. It's a classic, And avoid the 'remake' travesty of a film.",Dawn of the Dead
502,Exile-Inc,A Well Done Horror,9,19 March 2004,"Let's face it - the whole ""undead"" plotline has been done and then done again, from movies like Army of Darkness to Resident Evil and all the ones in between, there have been the good, the bad, and the ugly.The 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead definitely qualifies as one of the good ones. The basic storyline is one that is done in all horror movies: survival. Incorrectly labeled as a ""plague"" by some of the previous comments, this zombie hysteria is one that spreads from bite to bite. A small band of survivors manage to make it to a shopping mall where they hide out and figure out what to do and how to survive. Right from the beginning, the movie doesnt waste time setting up character roles as it does this during the different situations that they must face.With unwaivering amounts of zombies, tension filled scenes and comedic relief, this film definitely was something that is worth your time. If you're a survival horror fan, don't miss out on this above-average film.",Dawn of the Dead
503,In_Name_And_Blood,Great fun but no classic,6,8 August 2005,"Let's face it. I didn't want this movie to be made. I felt like kicking someone's dog when it was announced. How could the studios give first-timer Zack Snyder money to remake George Romero's classic, yet not give Georgie a couple of bucks to finish off his own series? I didn't watch this at the movies, even though I love James Gunn. It finally came out in its 'uncut' form on DVD and.... it was pretty cool. Some of the ideas were well executed (if unoriginal), Ving Rhames turned in a spirited performance and no, my copy of the original didn't mysteriously disappear after seeing this newer version.The pace of the film was tight, the makeup was brilliant and I had a helluva time sitting through it. But afterwards...nothing. What I had seen was much like the popcorn I munched throughout, tasty but not exactly nutritious. Romero's original trilogy was like sitting down to a kilo steak, potatoes, chips and a fine glass of wine. You felt satisfied. Dawn of the Dead 2004 was so full of quick cuts, bloodless killings, CGI and paper thin characters that a week later, I could remember little about the movie other than a few key plot points and ""hey...that's cool"" moments.These feelings were only heightened when I watched DotD '04 a couple of days after Romero's Land of the Dead, a film that managed to pack in as many hip, exciting scenarios whilst offering deep characters and and a thoughtful storyline. And you actually got to see the zombies. Snyder did great, but he couldn't get close to Romero.But enough about Romero. Snyder's created an above-average horror flick that's a great way to pass a couple of hours. There's enough action in there to please even the fussiest of fans, some truly eerie imagery and is a fantastic addition to the genre. You just might have to grab a burger on the way home.",Dawn of the Dead
504,raven-179,Another remake - another failure.,4,5 January 2005,"The last year was a year of remakes - exorcist, phantom of the opera, dawn of the dead etc. and they have one thing in common they failed. Of course it's always very hard to recreate the atmosphere of the original and balance between making the whole movie scary because of the feeling of hopelessness and loneliness the main characters feel or by showing zombies that look like a bad parody on clowns (terrible makeup etc).The original movie was quite nice for a zombie movie it had the atmosphere that was scary by itself and even the synthetic looking zombies couldn't spoil the fun. The remake lacks this atmosphere, the zombies look and act more like drunkards after a bar brawl rather than scary undead monsters that are hungry for human flesh.My suggestion - watch the original movie.",Dawn of the Dead
505,shpoodog,Not bad,7,2 February 2005,"I went into this not knowing if I was going to like it. If you can get past the idea of Undead Olympic Sprinting Super Humans instead of our shambling old friends in the original, it's actually pretty enjoyable. I liked how the film worked dialogue and images from the original into the remake and even into some of the key scenes. The Tom Savini scene was also golden.On the down side, I didn't buy some of the character actions here and there and the dog plan was down right stupid. The rule that made it work wasn't established until a character said so. It reeked of a convenient plot device. I also liked the ending before the credits rolled and would have preferred that instead of the bit during the credits, just because they would have captured the same feel of the original's ending. It also seems that the zombies would have smashed the glass front of the mall in order to get in faster than it could be boarded up. The remake was also missing a pie fight. >:( Over all, this was an enjoyable horror/action flick.",Dawn of the Dead

507,bewnhurr,cashing in on the hype from 28 days later.,5,23 June 2016,"This one is really hard to judge due to the fact that it's a melting pot. It takes the deeper meaning of the original and throw it out of the window in favor of more action packed stuff. It's like Dawn of the dead from 1978 and 28 days later had a baby. They wanted to have the best of both worlds but sadly i just think that i rather watch either the original or 28 days later.That being said, it's not a bad movie. If i had to describe it, i would say its a mixed bag. The good moments are great and the bad moments are horrible. I think that we could have done well without the montage scene in the middle of the movie, it felt out of place for me. The dark humor is good, i especially like when they are up on the roof and play a game with their rooftop neighbor shooting famous zombies (or Look-alikes).The movie start out good, but as it progresses i lost interest. Mainly because i did not care for our main cast except for CJ played by Michael Kelly. I can understand if people like this movie more than i did, i have friends who think that it surpasses the original because the original is a very slow movie with tons of buildup.For me personally it comes down to the running zombies. Some people like them more, some people like them less (Me included). While i did enjoy 28 days later, fast zombies remove the feel of dread from the lurking zombies. It just seems easier to create a real threat with running zombies. If the zombies are slow like in the original, you can take it out without a problem. Here however even a single zombie can be a real threat. Once again, this is a personal taste and i can see why people like the running zombies.",Dawn of the Dead

I really liked the new approach as opposed to all the others that the zombies just lumbered around.If you haven't seen this one you definitely should.

Relentless from the opening to the end. (Let me just say the zombies tear you apart as your on your back, kicking like a turtle, Voice box being torn out while your screaming) What a screening!!

Excellent casting and writing combine to make this better than the already marvelous original. The mall setting still works as it did years ago: while the original veered towards social commentary of how we live mindlessly in a consumer society, this version implies that mall, represents sanctuary, a reminder for survivors of the familiar and comfortable, where people once went to socialize and relax, in a sooothing and familiar place. Of course, with zombies around, the mall now offers only a temorary respite. The tension between characters heightens the suspense. One last note: do not miss a second of the end credits; it provides a gut wrenching finale to the movie.",Dawn of the Dead

Unfortunately, This was a comedy and not a horror. SPOILERS: Let me remind you of a few jokes about this film before you can say that it was at all good. 1) Why were some people that were bitten turned into zombies after 5 minutes yet others after a couple days? 2) Why is it that when they went into the garage to turn on the breakers they were chased by zombies that could get in, but while working on their tanks....I mean buses there was not a zombie in sight? 3)When leaving the mall wasnt it at all kinda funny that they are surrounded by atleast 2000 zombies, then they throw a propane tank that lands 5 feet away from the bus that explodes into a thermo nuclear bomb that kills all the zombies within a 100 yards but the bus is left unscathed? 4) Did I mention that they turned 2 buses into tanks in a matter of a day or 2? 5) How and why did the girl go to the gun shop across the street when she saw her dog was fine? Also how did she manage to get downstairs and into the truck in a matter of 30 secs? By the way, werent they saying getting to the truck would be impossible yet a 14 year old did it. hmmm. These are just a handful of jokes that i found amusing while watching this film. I think overall the film was terrible, plot was a joke, and if I had a chance to watch this or zombie lake it would be a real tough toss up. 1 out of 10 stars and thats just cause a few of the original characters were featured in the film.",Dawn of the Dead

Hello-oo?? The consequences of her incongruous dullness at that moment made me really angry. Nothing comparable to this happened during the first half.This gives the impression that the cast & crew, in the course of the making of this movie, ran out of time, money, skills, creativity and genius. Though this disappointed me a lot, it still deserves an overall 8/10 rating, since it's outstanding in spite of everything.",Dawn of the Dead

Having seen this preview I was expecting an atmospheric and chilling film, I should have stopped it after ten minutes. There are many things wrong with this film without even comparing it to the original, firstly is the 'slick' new metal/ Jonny Cash soundtrack which merely cheapens any of the atmosphere promised by the prologue - 28 Days Later wins hands down on this front. Secondly the characters are too many in number and too transparent to care about, in the original one had a sense of empathy for the characters. Thirdly the film was not scary in the slightest or indeed tense, the zombies in the original were within touching distance of the characters not 'safely' contained outside only to become a problem when one of the idiot characters goes on a suicide mission to rescue a dog. Finally this film has nothing of the sub-textual relevance of Romero's original which made a satirical swipe at consumer culture and made one question who was worse, the zombies or the humans. Overall a big, big disappointment except for the zombie baby which actually made me laugh - so bonus points for comic entertainment I guess.",Dawn of the Dead
514,hollywoodhorrorchick,a GOOD remake?!?!?!,9,9 April 2007,"It's true! They DO exist! I know, I can't believe it either. This movie has been brought back from the (un)dead for some updated, innovative, zombie fun. The main difference I saw in the portrayal of the zombies, as opposed to how they appear in older movies, is that these zombies know how to RUN. None of that slow, rocking, arms straight ahead zombie walk. These guys will chase you down. Brilliant! The film starts with one of the best opening sequences out there, very well crafted, and it only takes about a minute to get right to the action. Great editing, and great special effects. Then the title sequence, done to a Johnny Cash song, is one of my favorite parts, and is highly entertaining on its own. The body of the film is rich with examinations of survival instincts and human behavior under pressure. A very smart, very scary, very fun movie. Brilliant!",Dawn of the Dead

516,janemason100,decent remake,7,22 October 2006,"When I think of ""Dawn of the dead"" I think of the original featuring Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger. However this version is more of a film that has a doomsday feeling to it because the initial tone of the film is a lot more fast paced and the zombies seem to have speeder up and are a lot more dangerous and psychotic than their lumbering counterparts in the original.Sarah Polley is great as the main character while Ving Rhames is great as the disgruntled police officer and Jake Weber,Mekhi Phifer, and Lindy Booth are great counterparts who add their own credentials to the production in their Zombie infested hellhole where they are situated. This version of the film has been trimmed considerably from the original in which that focused on the isolation and how would you fill the time if you had an abandoned mall while on the flip side this one focuses more on the action and not the mental side of it all just like the first one did. However, a new addition to the film were the Zombies who instead of lumbering aimlessly around they attack with a ferocity like no other. However, one thing I like about this film is the use of different ideas within the film. and toys with different scenarios on how to escape and does not resort to a scene by scene remake of a film done oh so poorly by Gus van Sant in the 1998 version of ""Psycho"" that film made me laugh. However, when watching I do feel that the narrative is a little weak and is not as well made as the original and the other characterised are just there to be Zombie chow therefore, allowing the main characters escape.In conclusion it is a well made film that is worth buying on D.V.D but if you want a memorable zombie film I recommend the original",Dawn of the Dead

The film keeps you entertained from beginning to end and just when you feel your heart rate slowing down it quickly speeds it back up to keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.This Dawn is much different than George A. Romeros, it ups the action and intensity 20 times while not treading or belittling the original in anyway. It keeps the integrity and respect of the original film and does it's own thing. And it does it well. The first 15 minutes of this film have to be the most breath taking and spectacular 15 minutes for a zombie horror film ever made, and from that point forward you are hooked for the entire 2 hours.I had the pleasure of seeing both the R-rated and Unrated versions and you can really see two completely different films between the 10 minutes of added footage. The Unrated cut ups the intensity and horror feel big time and with added scenes it gives the viewer a whole new creepiness not seen in modern zombie films.Forget renting this film, it is must own for any DVD collection.",Dawn of the Dead

The CGI is a bit ropey and the story moves far too rapidly, the controversial decision to make the zombies fast and athletic works better than in '28 Days Later' but there was not enough gore for me, the cannibalistic element was not played up like in the original.  A great effort though, I hope the same director makes a sequel to the film.

Sarah Polley manages to pull us in (with her liquid eyes and the soft cadence of her speech) almost instantly. The peril she finds herself in is so effective because she manages to seem so ordinary, so available. I can't think of another actress who manages to convey her combination of vulnerability and tenacity (see ""The Claim"" for more proof), yet she's never precious, she seems to barely know the camera exists. It's strange to find such good performances, across the board, in a zombie movie. Everyone is up to the task, and nearly all of them have strong believable character shifts that are surprising for this genre (to say the least). Rent it along with ""Shawn of the Dead"".

522,Dude_001,"Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead serves not only as an improvement over the original, but also as one of the greatest undead films of the 21st century.",8,22 February 2009,"A worldwide plague, of which there seems to be no cure and questionable origins, brings humanity to it's knees. Symptoms include death, depravity,bloodshed, insanity. Amidst the chaos, a group of survivors take shelter in a local mall, and it is here they search for the hope of a 'normal' life once again. However, the dead never cease to knock on their doors...Call it blasphemy, but I am not the biggest fan of George A. Romero's original Dawn of the Dead. It ran too long, the zombies where to blue, and the tone was to tipsy. Now it is a great zombie film, however, needless to say I did not protested the announcement of this film, an updated, action packed, character orientated zombie film which, pardon the pun, breathes life into a dying genre.The original Dawn of the Dead began in the midst of the outbreak, with characters aware that something wrong was happening and their world was falling apart around them. This new dawn begins much more innocently: Our heroine, a young nurse by the name of Ana, played by the very pretty Sarah Polley, is completely unaware anything is amiss until the problem shows up on her front door- and then through the door and tearing into her bedroom. The first 20 minutes of this film are pure chaos, as this young women sees her world crashing, burning, and screaming all around her.Dawn of the Dead is a thrill ride, a real roller coaster of a movie. It is at times genuinely suspenseful, at times gory, at times oddly humorous, and at other times, quite tragic and touching. Sarah Polley does a great job as the lead, she handles herself well and is a blast to watch, while Ving Rhymes macho, no nonsense attitude and his dominating presence absolutely bleeds through the screen onto the audience's lap. The cast does a good job of working with various emotions, and the actors (and characters) in this show are as convincing to the audience when they bond and struggle to maintain a sense of hope, as when they struggle and war against the masses of the undead.And speaking of the undead, Dawn of the Dead has plenty of them, and these ain't your daddy's zombies. The slow, lurching zombies of Romero's film are no where in sight; instead we are treated to an onslaught of faster, deadlier, but just as hungry, undead. Now the debate of 'fast zombies vs slow zombies' rages to this day, and though I do prefer the 'classic' zombie, mostly for their rustic charm, these running zombies fit the action orientated tone of the film to an undead T. And though this film is not the first to feature these quick moving killers (1985's Return of the Living Dead comes immediately to mind, and even the original Dawn of the Dead featured one scene with running zombies), it defiantly employs them unlike any other.Now I do have some faults with this horror show: The middle of the film had quite a safe feel, and though this was probably intentional to up the climax, it didn't quite groove with me. The very end of the film was some what of a let down; it almost seemed like a lot of build up to nothing.Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead serves not only as an improvement over the original, but also as one of the greatest undead films of the 21st century. What Snyder and James Gunn, the writer, is enrich an already fertile source material, and we might not see a zombie film quite like this and of this quality in some time.8/10",Dawn of the Dead
523,carolinawrestler,The end of the world romero style,10,28 July 2011,"As for zombie movies go, dawn of the dead 2004 is really on top of its game. MOst disaster movies will have a tremendous amount of action to keep you entertained, but dawn of the dead explores where other movies stop. In this movie, we clearly see people fighting to survive against a never ending army, becoming stranded in a shopping mall and society collapses. They hear no news, they are surrounded by death and this entire outbreak and they have to deal with each other.One good aspect out of this movie was the fact when they arrived at the mall and got in, the head security guard quickly was NOT going to allow them to stay and then insisted on locking them up. He seemed like a bully and was quick to pull out his gun and threaten people, and was definitely not your favorite character, but he quickly improved as the movie went on, and he was out there to survive. On the other hand there were ""passive"" and nonviolent people in this movie who were less adept at handling these situations. At the same time, there were lowlifes they had to deal with (a snotty worthless survivor who always talked trash to everyone and then became NO help when everyone counted on him). Then there was a nurse, and a few normal people who were just trying to survive and they were the real survivors. One survivor had an infected wife and became irrational and tried to keep her at the mall depsite the danger.The general message was that the people who are quick to action and stay strong survive and those who wimp out die. However, the deeper message was that the people eventually decided to leave the mall (freaking out about being trapped there), and they go through the town only to find that they are the ONLY survivors and that the roads are virtually unpasassible and ultimately resulting in their demise.At the end of the movie it seems to be NO clear answer and ALL of the place is infected and its basically the end of the world as there seem to be NO survivors and the entire population and all armies have succombed.",Dawn of the Dead
524,Zombeefan,A remake that is entertaining,7,13 May 2010,"Tried to make this Spoiler Free, but warning is in place just in case.Remakes have been the studio biz model for quite some time now and the craze seemed to have kicked into high gear around 2002. Now most people can't stand the thought of a remake because as we age we have already fell in love with the original and it is hard for a remake of a film we love to capture the magic of its original/parent.Zack Snyder was tapped to helm the 2004 reboot of George A. Romero's Zombie classic DAWN of the DEAD, a commercial and documentary director making his debut in feature film motion pictures. Zack brought a different kind of energy to the table with this reboot of the classic film, but he didn't bring the epic feel and vibe from the original film.While Romero has gone on record saying DAWN was like comic book romp, it still had a very deep horror vibe and even though you spend the majority of the film inside the mall with the cast, the film always felt bigger, and this was done effectively by setting up the chaos of the zombie uprising from the get go by having the commentators arguing on TV about how to deal with the situation. That single moment set the entire tone for DAWN of the DEAD and while it has its campier moments it was forever cemented in celluloid history as a zombie horror film.Zack doesn't try that approach, nor does DAWN of the DEAD 2004 contain anything remotely related to what you would consider horror. Instead what DAWN of the DEAD 2004 does do is become a terror action film. Zack sets up the story and visuals nicely within the first ten minutes, but loses that epic feel by not following the successful formula Romero used in DAWN 1978. Now of course had he copied what Romero did it would have been pointless, but DAWN 2004 manages to move in a completely different direction where the mall is just a safe haven, not a social commentary on consumerism. To get the film into a somewhat quasi horror mode he uses the track star style zombies found in the recent 28 Days Later film from 2002. While this is great to create moments of terror it doesn't create the element of horror.Now you'd think I hate DAWN 2004 by what I am saying, but I don't. I just don't hold it in high regard like the original film. Zack effectively made a commercialized version of DAWN of the DEAD, but he didn't have the magic to make it what it could have been and that can be contributed to the screenplay written by James Gunn, which was kind of weak, but what made up for the screenplay was some of the cast and characters.Michael (Jake Webber) is probably the most fascinating character in the film, not a man of a lot f words his feeling and emotions are expressed by facial expressions and body language. He wants to fight, he wants to survive and he is not just thinking of himself but of everyone stuck in the situation. This is a great trait in modern horror films that you don't see very often and it is Jake's acting that seals the deal and makes Dawn 2004 work well.My biggest disappointment was the lack of use for actor Ving Rhames. Ving, a great character actor is good to have on screen, but is so under used that it seemed like a waste to have him in the cast. Tis a shame because I think had the screenplay been given another pass through by another writer they could have flushed his character out more. What you do learn of his character is minimal, but it is told in such a way you want to know more. One of the original drafts of the DAWN 2004 screenplay had a set up of how VING ended up meeting Sarah Polley, why he was on foot and what he witnessed that had him toughened up, but due to budget constraints or whatever the issue this element of the screenplay was dropped in favor of a quick meeting in the woods at the wreck site of Polley's TOYOTA... (must of been a sticky gas pedal) Anyway, my biggest complaint would have to be the under use of VING in the flick.Sarah Polley, a decent addition, but doesn't really bring anything to the table worth noting. She or her character really don't stand out.Ty Burrell, who plays Steve the millionaire snob and Michael Kelly (CJ) really deserve some kudos's because between them both they were just about to steal the show, I wish one or the other would have pulled it off, but the mix of each of them having their own selfish attitudes worked great and made for some really entertaining moments. While CJ and Steve are the films two antagonists, you end up rooting for one before the film ends, that characters transformation was a little quick, but worthy and delivers one of the funniest and fist pumping lines when he gets himself into some tough situations.The rest of the cause was OK, and you could easily tell who would be meeting their maker once they were introduced on screen, which is sort of a shame, but you can't have a horror film without a body count... and the zombies don't count.Anyway, if you're looking for a 2 hour entertaining action based zombie film DAWN of the DEAD 2004 is a nice treat on a boring afternoon. If you want depth, locate the original flick and give it watch. Either way though, I will say DAWN 2004 is one of the better remakes out today and it deserves to be watched and celebrated.",Dawn of the Dead
525,e_pobats,"Very funny, well made film.",8,21 March 2004,"Okay, if you can go into this movie with an open mind, and a dark sense of humor, you will not only love this movie, but you will laugh your a** off. I thought it was great, the humor was so clever, the music was wonderfully chosen, and every line that Ving Rahmes said was terribly bad ass. The script seemed to be poking fun at itself at times, as this was very well written. Not that the dialog will win an Oscar, but it certainly made me laugh.  The entire theater I was in was in hysterics several times. There was also some interesting social commentary, but I believe thats all up to the viewer to decide weather or not they want to look for that. The music in this movie was sweet, as it opens with Johny Cashs' ""The Man Comes Around."" Also through out this film we are treated to Lounge Against the Machine versions of several great songs, which just add to the humor.
I think this film is all about having a good time in a theater, while watching very cool special effects, and getting ""blown away"" (sorry) by all the onscreen confrontation. Very fun, and great for the entire Adams Family.
Personally, I liked the idea of fast zombies, as I first saw in 28 Days Later. Im not sure how the die hard zombie fans will like this, but as an ""average"" movie goer, i was way into it. 8.5 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead

But since I haven't seen the original ""Dawn Of The Dead"" (1978), I wasn't THAT skeptical when I decided to watch this film, and after all...I didn't really expect more from this film than great entertainment.This film takes place in a town where people, one day, wakes up to a invasion by flesh-hungry zombies. We follow a group of people who seeks cover in a mall. The zombies doesn't manage to get into the mall, but the people know that they can't stay there forever and they starts planning what they should do to survive.Even though I haven't seen too many of them, zombie-films aren't exactly my favorites. Peter Jackson's ""Braindead"" (1992) is the only one I've seen that I really like, but the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy is on my ""to-be-watched"" list. Still, it's a fact that ""Dawn Of The Dead"" is a very entertaining film with some interesting elements. It doesn't have the deepest story I've ever heard about, but it has just enough of the ingredients that should satisfy someone who would like to watch a zombie-film: lots of gore, thrilling scenes, a little humor and action from beginning to end.Zack Snyder has done a approved job with this movie, and he has made a very modern-style zombie-film. When it comes to the camera-work and the zombies, he seems to be heavily inspired by British director Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" (2002). This is not the ""good old"" zombies that were slow and stupid, and that you could almost have a cup of tea in front of, before they got close enough to grab you. These zombies are just as fast as human beings, and if you don't pay attention, you may have one in your throat before you know it. This makes the zombies more scary, off course.Among the actors in the cast, there wasn't anyone who impressed me. Ving Rhames is the only one I really know, and he delivered one of the best performances. But I wasn't expecting the actors to be catching the most of my attention, and they're doing a good enough job based on a script with restricted character-portrayal and development.""Dawn Of The Dead"" is popcorn-entertainment. Not much depth or intelligence, just Action from beginning to end. Zack Snyder has made a debut-movie, which is refreshing compared to all the mediocre Hollywood horror-films we have been drowned in for several years now. It has charm and gives the viewers exactly what they want. Yeah, we might see some good films from Snyder in the future. 7.5 out of 10",Dawn of the Dead
527,bloggster,One Kick Ass Zombie Movie!,9,19 April 2004,"Enthralling, Enjoyable, Scary, Suspencful and Humerous all great words to describe DOTD 2004. I cant say I was a fan of the origional, while the premise was fine the execution was poor. But thats enough comparation as the director himself said this is not a scene for scene remake its a completely different movie. And I would have to agree, aside from the zombies and the mall there is nothing else linking this to the origional.The Film itself top notch, It keeps your attention from the beginning and dosnt let go until the end of the credits (DO NOT LEAVE THE CINEMA OR STOP THE FILM UNTIL THE CREDITS HAVE FINISHED!). The acting is also first class. Ving Rames Shows shows how underused her has been in the Mission Impossible movies (Something that will hopefully be set right in MI:3). While the rest of the actors put in an equally convincing performance.The Special Effects both Physical and CG are fantastic and beyond what I thought would have been possible on such a low budget movie.I cannot fault this movie in any way as hard as I try.9/10",Dawn of the Dead

529,replica,"Good horror, but not if you've seen the original",7,29 March 2004,"The film is too short at around 100 minutes, which with this subject matter it needs to be at least 2 hours long to allow character development,and to give some background to the events etc. Because of this you dont give two hoots for any of the characters, and they are playing it for laughs as well - no one looks very concerned and they all seem to be taking it in their stride, as if the dead come back to 'life' every day. So whats wrong with this film, here goes : the Zombies run - zombies should'nt run they are dead !, the female at the start of the film is chased by her zombie boyfriend who punches the windshield through on her car, but when the survivors are in the shopping mall the zombies cant break the entrance doors ??, there is no character development, and the film builds no sense of being trapped as in the original.There are too many survivors holed up in the shopping mall, characters are introduced and then not given any time to develop. In saying that if you have'nt seen the original you may well enjoy this movie - as a horror it is a good film, with plenty of action and good SFX. However the original was a GREAT film which makes this remake pale in comparison.It could've been so much better.",Dawn of the Dead

Hadn't seen this movie for quite awhile, but had seen three other times prior. I'm pretty sure the last time I had seen it it was on tv, edited and the picture quality wasn't great. That was maybe four or five years ago. So, watching it again now in blue-ray quality blew me away again. - particularly after getting through season 9 of TWD.This movie is sooooo good. Almost flawless but close enough that I give it a 10/10. It's the best of this genre. And to think it was made in 2004. Unreal. It just proves to me that good movies came to an end in about 2012. Dawn of the Dead proves to me great movie making and quality of the highest order existed back in 2004 (and earlier, not to take the time to list examples). But this rivals anything. I give the Resident Evil franchise the edge with 28 Days Franchise a close second.But this zombie flick is the legit gold standard.",Dawn of the Dead

535,Fanofmovs,"The humanity's reign is over, behold, it's time for the zombies to take the reins...",8,28 April 2004,"Greetings, zombie fans***warning some spoilers (in all 3 sizes-small, medium & big) through out the text*** First, I am a DOWN-STRAIGHT DRUNK movieholic (lol) in general (being horror one of my beloved genres). I don't tend to become excite when a remake of a movie is in works (mostly from a classic movie), and certainly when it's a Hollywood remake (you have permission to fear the result).but.now and then, some remakes are quite good. In fact, some (like The Thing that's one of my favorite movies of all time!) warp pass the original. I am not saying that Dawn of 2004 is better than Dawn of 1978, because each movie as it's own thing going on. Well, this review and tender love is about Dawn 2004, so I will focus more on it. But I have to admit that in some things, new Dawn surpasses the original (makeup, editing, action scenes, lightning, cameos, and more departments - of course that bigger budget and things that we can use in recent years heighten in it too). Perhaps you don't agree with me but the stories of both are strong for a zombie movie and in both the interactions are top notch (of course it's easy with the 78 version because it's only four characters) And don't having the same satires in new Dawn doesn't make it a bad movie, on the contrary. The story of the original is centered in only four characters and the running time is bigger, in this one the story have more survivors and the running time is smaller.but I thought that the characters in this one were well built (not all characters have deepness but some), and if you pay attention it's the tidbits of dialogue, face expressions, actions and choices of everyone and so on that deliver the profundity of each. I know that everyone has is opinions but another thing that always bothers me (specially in this kinds of movies is that many times people start saying that `characters are flat' or `only meat to be eaten' but that's not that linear: 1) it's a zombie movie and a survival movie at the same time and we don't expect to see people reciting Shakespeare or saying `oh, I need t tell the story of my life for viewers to see that I have so much deepness that I am a walking sized black hole of development'; 2) you have to imagine if you were in the same situation, so many of the dialogues and actions would be the same or similar in many areas and events happening (you would want to search for your brother, if you were in a shop you would want to try a bunch of clothes, have fun playing videogames, etc); 3) there aren't clichés in this movie because in real life cops, nurses, family man, pregnant lady, or even a circus clown could be among the survivors; 4) don't think that in an `end of the World' situation all the survivors will be heroes or good persons or even remain united, people change for good or worse as in all real life circumstances (many times people say about a movie `why the goody soldier gone berserker and attacked the old lady?', couldn't that happen in real life too? - the movie effectively shows that a future family father can gone crazy and a apparently asshole dude can sacrifice himself to save lives or even a bad person can remain a bad person); 5) remember again, the running time on this one is smaller and if the movie was all character development that would turn out to be zombie drama starring zombie `Burt Reynolds' wanna-be as the father of four tiny zombies (you have to imagine that they talked and interacted more than we saw in the screen - as what happens with every movie, ex: in LOTR you can't actually compute that all the times that Aragorn talked with Legolas were the ones that we saw them on screen); 6) did I forget to mentioned that's a zombie movie for crying out loud? (saying that doesn't mean that the movie itself don't have drama or comedy, and all that - in fact it possesses big doses of those too, and thank God for that). The speedy zombies: well, I already saw many zombie movies and practically in all of them the undead are clumsy and slow, in this one they are not and that's not either a bad thing.I though the zombies in this one were a lot more scarier and menacing than the ones in the original and others zombie movies (Zombie, Brain Dead, RE, Day, Nights, City of the Living Dead, Return, etc).hey, I can live with slow zombs and fast zombs, so what? The already tired comparison between the fasty zombs and fasty infected in 28 Days Later (both have terrifying freaky hombres) that many people insist: first, the infected are not zombs and because the ones in Dawn 2004 are similar to the ones in 28 Days doesn't mean that they ripped it off (it's not like this `for now on all the future movies that have wire-fu fights are rip offs of Matrix'). 28 Days Later is one of my favorite movies too and has more character development (again focused in few characters) than Dawn 2004 but Dawn is so much great in all (even the timing of character development's insertion is great) that I almost can put that in the same pedestal. About the actors & characters: first, Ving Rhames is one of my favorite actors (he has a strong presence in any movie, both physically and psychologically - as someone already told, I too can see him peal potatoes for 2 hours and sill be mesmerized by him), and he's perfect in this movie (the character was made for him) and he shows a sure and calm presence throughout the movie (the coolness and badass presence emerges many times too). He's like a big sentimental guy in a cop uniform. The chemistry between him and Andy (a distant interaction because Kenneth is in the mall and Andy is in his own store, so the communication between them is restricted to binoculars and writing signs) is an odd but true friendship both sad and endearing.but even that doesn't stop Kenneth to shoot him when he turns zombie. I saw few movies with Sarah Polley (Dawn and Go) but I building a love for her.she is amazing (the look and the emotions are beautiful in her) as the nurse of the band., Ana. Jake Weber as straight caring guy called Michael was profound and he carried many great dramatic moments. He was like the worried father of them all. Mekhi Phifer as Andre, future family man, is very good too and his obsession to `built a family in a mad World' (doesn't bother him if his family develops a hunger of human flesh) shows that people change to worse sometimes. I wanted more screen time of him. Michael Kelly as CJ stunned me in a good way, I thought he was an all-out bastard but that was not exactly right. His line in the elevator (lol) is one of my favorite moments in movie history. All the others actors (secondary and such) were all also very good in their characters (even the ones that I didn't know much about, such as Monica, Norma, etc). The character that engulfs the others is the Cross Roads Mall (the name says everything because all the survivors came from different places and are different as individuals). It can be cozy and/or threatening. There are many fantastic moments in this movie such as the celebrity target practice, the birth scene (the baby could have been a little better), the truck escape, the visit in Andy's gun store, the chaotic opening and many many more. Almost ZERO negative things about this movie, but I felt that the movie could be much longer, more things to happen, and consequently more interaction and character development, action, suspense, horror, drama, and so forth. Action pieces (different environments and weapons); lightning (light & darkness, the prove that lanterns are very handy); music (all the soundtracks are amazing and fit the movie's tune, specially the Johnny Cash music); cinematography (great); art design & art direction (the dread trucks are a mean-deadly running machine and a fortress even against hordes of zombies); special effects & visual effects (great great); sound (great); costume (great); make-up (some freakishly zombies with bloody cream on top - excellent work people); gore (heads exploding, necks being munched, inclusion of pointy instruments in various body parts, shot wounds, chainsaw mayhem, etc, did I need to say more?) are thumbs UP. The cameos (alive and inorganic ones) are more than welcome: Ken Foree as a priest says his famous line is superb, Tom Savini as a tough cop is very funny, Scott Reiniger as The General is worth big time. The inorganic that I spotted are the cameo of Gayle Ross as a cloth store's name and the helicopter from the original giving a little screen flight. In the movie, I was like one of them.among the survivors.feeling what they fell, sweating as they run, enjoying life when I could, and fighting for my life as they fight, and so on. The final is so bleak an unnerved as the original, even more so because we know the last survivors suffers one more zombie attack and we are left thinking if someone escaped or not (in the end of the original the two survivors fly to an unknown fate with little supplies but doesn't end with them being attacked). But one thing is sure, Chips the dog surely survived the zombies.and me being a big animal lover I was cheering for him too. So, did I like the movie? No, I loved it (I already seen it twice - and will definitely have it in DVD). I recommend for everyone to see it, even non-zombie fans or non-horror fans. Who knows, maybe the movie can bring more zombie adepts to our much-loved genre. As Moriarty (from AICN) says `it's a good time to be a zombie fan right now' and he's right, and this year is one great year for those `appreciators of human meat' (Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Resident Evil 2, and so on). Last year and future years are promising with Diamond Dead by George Romero being made, an Australian's Undead, remake of Day of the Dead and more. I sure hope that bid-budget and independent movie studios decide to make more zombie movies to delight us all. And as Dr Logan in Day of the Dead and Barbara in Night of the Living Dead 90 say `They're us. We're them and they're us.'. As simple as that. Enjoy movies. CYA. =)",Dawn of the Dead
536,chrsmoores,Great Film,8,28 November 2005,"I really like this film although I do like Zombie films in general. The sense of being trapped and pursued by an intransigent enemy that wants to eat you is an incredible premise for a movie. Just how rational men and women would behave in that situation is fascinating. We had petrol shortages here a few years ago and there were some folk who'd have taken a head shot for a few gallons of 4 star. The veneer of civilisation is ever so thin and this film portrays that very well. A normal guy who is sooooo proud of his chainsaw option for sawing the legs off of Zombies who cling to the ""A Team"" inspired bus, is one example. Could you have shot Matt Frewer before he turned? In the UK we have little notion of guns but I suspect even in the US very few would have been able to. But once those flesh eating monsters make a move, gimme that semi auto, I'm a blowin' some Zombie brains out! Films that add a Superhuman to battle the undead, like in the Resident Evil films lose something, it needs be Joe and Joanne public that put up the fight. Imaging a Zombie attack in Metropolis? Where's the danger there? Superman could vapourise 'em all in no time. No, it needs normal people, in the US with oodles of guns, in the UK with sharp sticks and cricket bats, to fend of the fiends. I also liked the way you never know who's gonna get bit, no-one is safe, the ending is never clear so the tension builds and builds. I've seen this movie 4 times now and if it's on again this weekend put me down for 5. Great, scary entertainment",Dawn of the Dead
537,IrisGoeth,"Nice action, but it lacks soul",6,20 May 2009,"I had a low level of expectation when I rented this movie because you just can't hope for too much when preparing for a horror flick. However, a GREAT beginning immediately raised the bar. Both the ""before and after"" sequences in the Milwaukee suburbs and the opening credits were thrilling, chilling and fabulous.Much to my disappointment however, things become much more predictable and clichéd when they all get together in the mall. The characters I found hard to really care for, or at least dislike because, even in the case of a good actress like Sarah Polley, they're not very well sketched. The mall itself, what purpose did it serve? As many other reviewers have pointed out, in the original movie social commentary was everywhere and the mall, the ultimate symbol for (especially suburban, middle-class) consumerism, was an ideal location. Plus, the zombies kept wandering around the shops, which was funny! This movie lacks, besides a political slant, a good sense of humor. Even the celebrity-shooting scene I found somewhat uninspired (although many find it hilarious, so to each his/her own).The good points however are the pace (which allows for repeated viewing) and, if we judge the movie strictly by its own merits (ignoring the fact that it claimed to be a remake of something else, which could have been left out because it's a DIFFERENT movie), that it's a dignified horror and action story, decently acted and has a couple of memorable moments, which is a lot right now. Don't expect too much and you'll be okay!",Dawn of the Dead
538,demolition-him,Among the top 5 best Zombie Movies ever made!!!,10,13 October 2011,"I watched this movie back to back with Original Dawn of the dead. I never watched either of them before & watched them based on IMDb reviews. After watching both of them together, Original sort of disappointed me whereas Remake was complete kick a**.Sure, new one has its faults & goofs but in totality it is much better cinematic experience. Fast zombies are genuinely scary & movie is chilling. Many fans of old have issues with the fact that new movies totally crapped on old one's concept by making living dead run because dead will be made of stiff muscles so fast running is out of question. George Romero showed his disdain as well. I think George Romero is just jealous because his concept has been improved & made genuinely scary & not only that we actually get to have a brief idea that it might be some kind of virus (as per opening sequence) which might have mutated humans into some kind of undead nightmare & that virus passes through bites. This is unlike George Romero's vision where no explanation was given just a BS line that when there is no place in hell dead will walk the earth. WTF! Not giving explanation works in some movies like in Ringu but not in this genre. At least, we deserve a partial explanation which was given in this movie.IMO, acting was also vastly superior & so was pretty much everything from cinematography to music to overall story to chilling thrill, horror & suspense. I also do not agree with George Romero's take that movie didn't have any soul or in depth characterization. It had much more story & characterization than George Romero's movies. Since, I am not an American, I never understood so called social commentary in his movies. What exactly is his social commentary that American people are so dumb that they can't counter a threat of slow moving zombie because they are too greedy & have petty self interests. Note to Mr. Romero, next time when you make movies, consider this .. military in any country is more than a match for any slow moving zombie/zombies & most likely threat will be neutralized before it spreads so far & add to the fact that an average American carries weapon this threat would be neutralized even faster. However, when we factor fast moving zombies with more sentient behaviour, it is altogether a different ball game. There is a chance that humanity may lose war as infection may spread overnight. And this why I like this movie. The concept is scary & ending is too as after all this trial & error, more than likely the cast would have been devoured in the end as they came to an island full of zombies.I know there will be a lot of people who will probably disagree with me but watch it with open mind with the points I just made & I am sure you will love this movie especially if you like your horror movie to be really scary.Totally recommended.",Dawn of the Dead

The blood in this film did look better than the original Dawn of the Dead, but other than that it was a terrible movie.

The only thing that's worse than the cast is the pedestrian direction of Zack Snyder, whose idea of directing a film is point and shoot and make lots and lots of cuts...Like a car commercial or a rock video...Anyway...Skip 2004 version and rent 1978 one...It's great!",Dawn of the Dead
543,primoooze1138,Zombies were never so much fun.,9,20 March 2004,"Though I haven't seen the original (but do intend to soon), I was drawn to this movie like the zombies to the mall.  The premise, people seeking refuge in a mall from a zombie epidemic, is a very intriguing one.  Normally, I'm not one for zombie films (The Romero's and the Raimi's being the exceptions).  But I found this to be a very entertaining film.  It is by no means scary or frightening, but it does have its share of creepy moments. Compared to 28 Days Later, this film seems to be going more for audience gratification, rather than the classiness of independent films.  In this aspect, Dawn of the Dead delivers time and again.  There's a great sequence involving celebrity look-alike zombies; though I won't ruin it for anyone. The movie's got a good sense of what it's trying to accomplish.  Director Zack Snyder and co. intend to bring George Romero's 1978 classic a modern touch, for a modern audience.  More often than not, the film works.  The plot (though altered) remains viable after 25 or so years.  Also, Dawn of the Dead has an excellent sense of humor.  Occasionally, the film seems to be mocking the whole concept of the end of the world.  Great action, great tunes (you ain't heard nothing 'til you've heard ""Down With the Sickness"" performed by a lounge singer), lots of fun.  I really enjoyed this film. 8/10.",Dawn of the Dead
544,TheTrick,"Not bad, not great",6,24 March 2004,"I went into Dawn of the Dead 2004 with fairly high expectations, being a moderate fan of Romero's original trilogy. What I got was a completely different film that is good for completely different reasons. It's impossible to avoid drawing comparisons between this film and the 1978 film that inspired it because, let's face it, they consciously decided to slap the same name on it. If they had just set the movie in a police station or something, they wouldn't have had to bother paying for the name. But I guess that's just the point; the title has built-in recognition going for it.That said, this is not nearly the abomination that other recent remakes have been (Texas Chainsaw Massacre comes to mind). It has lots of great action pieces, better actors than the original, and even some nice plot additions such as a character stuck on the roof of a gunshop across the street from the mall. You actually end up caring about the guy even though you only hear his voice in one brief scene.The violence is certainly also potent, which I suppose some people will be looking for in a horror movie. I found myself terribly annoyed by the quick-cutting music-video style editing in the action scenes, but it's still a whole lot better than some other recent remakes (Texas Chainsaw Massacre comes to mind). What I admired about Romero's films, however, is that the camera never doubts the potency of a scene, and simply shows the action in mostly still frames. Romero sets up a scene, let's it happen, and then moves on. The beauty is in its simplicity. Dawn of the Dead 2004 is like a hyper-active child, which some people will surely appreciate over its wiser, if somewhat sluggish, grandfather. It's all a matter of taste.As many other have argued, however, I did miss the original's depth and satirical sense of humour. Some may argue that it was cheesy, but I still see that as being the point. Sure, it had suspense, blood, and violence, but it was never an out-right scarefest. And, you know... I don't think there was anything wrong with that. I could understand if director Zack Snyder wanted to up the adrenaline a little, but why did all the characters have to become shallow caricatures? If the original Dawn had one strength, I would say that it respects its main four characters as human beings rather than throwing them into the fray for little purpose except to become zombie-fodder. Romero allowed us time to get to know his characters, understand their motivations, their weaknesses, their relationships, etc. Having 16 (or whatever number) people tossed into the mall over a mere hour and a half restricts character development (CJ suddenly turning nice doesn't count since he was a cartoon to begin with) and severely lessens the impact when things start to go wrong.And that's another thing... As much as I hate to cram the whole ""Romero's social commentary about consumerism"" thing down more peoples' throats, its absence leaves no good reason for these characters to hide out in a mall. People in the theatre actually broke out laughing around me when one of the characters says something along the lines of, ""Hey, let's go to the mall!"" The mall isn't even in sight and so it seems like a ludicrously random destination, and probably not the safest at that. Snyder's undead seem even faster and stronger than when they were alive, so I can't imagine that 2000 (there are a lot of zombies in this film) of them wouldn't have been able to break through the mall's glass doors. Finally, although Dawn 2004 had its share of jokes, it was not as tongue-in- cheek as the original, which I thought was sorely missed. People may say the pie fight was stupid... I say it was funny. People may say the guy checking his blood pressure (while being eaten) was stupid... I say it was funny. Even the individual zombies in this film weren't vaguely memorable. You never see any of them up close for more than 2 seconds because the editing is always so fast. You always just see them as a moving mass. Fans of the original will know right away what I mean when I talk about the ghetto-apartment-huband zombie, the helicopter-sliced zombie, the zombie with the gun, the kid zombies, the bride zombie, the hare krishna zombie, etc. The zombies of Dawn 2004 are a faceless, anonymous mass. Maybe that's scarier, I don't know, but it's definitely not more interesting for someone who just wants to see some zombies.Enough harping though. In summary, Dawn of the Dead 2004 is definitely not the Dawn we've always known, but if you close your eyes during the credits (missing the title), you might enjoy it just fine as a fun, mindless action/horror flick.",Dawn of the Dead
545,gpurin,The best Gore movie in quite a long time,7,16 January 2005,"First of all, let get clear, when you rent this movie you don't expect to see citizen Kane, if we keep that in mind, you would enjoy a really good movie that will keep your attention the whole 1:40 hours. We have a good story, characters that evolve, not a lot of insight on them, but thats OK, the movie centers in the life/death situation they are facing and the attempts they make to scape. The make up is excellent, and the camera work too, in the sum up is a decent flick for a Sunday afternoon, there is nothing like a little bit of gore to cheer you up I give it 7 out of 10. Enjoy the movie, but don't eat wile you are watching it",Dawn of the Dead
546,citysleeps,thrills a minute,10,21 March 2004,"i didn't expect this movie to be an exact remake of the original.  then again, i didn't expect it to be a straight up action flick.  tell you the truth, i didn't know what to expect.  it really is just another zombie movie that happens to have the title 'dawn of the dead' to back it up.  as i've read before, the only thing this movie has similar to the original is a shopping mall.it's did like it, though.  throughout the movie i wasn't sure if i should beentertained or disappointed, but in the end the former got me.  i mean, hey, at least we have another zombie movie.  the movie starts quite solidly.  unfortunately, it's the shining moment for sarah polley, because as the movie progresses an unnecessary amount of charactersare introduced.  the director spent too much time giving basic personalities to these people, thus it took away from the characters we're actually supposed to feel for  (i.e. sarah polley and ving rhames).but, like i said, its a zombie movie.  good times are to be had for all.  i think its lucky we got to see it in wide release at all.  i don't see how some people can see this movie in a packed theatre and brood over the fact that it doesn't stay true to the original.  there're people screaming left and right, the movie does what it's supposed to do, so appreciate it.   i mean, would you rather have this as opposed to nothing at all?  it's a zombie movie!  hell yeah!",Dawn of the Dead
547,audiosabbath_29720,THE BEST MOVIE EVER,10,28 March 2004,"ok i seriously love this movie ive seen it 4 times and i am going to see it again.  I am a huge fan of the horror genre and my type of horror movies are wait for it wait for it   THE ZOMBIE SUBGENRE.  Now im going to compare this dawn of the dead to the other dawn of the dead.  Yes I did mean other dawn of the dead bc lets be honest thats all it really is now.SPOILERS AHEAD AND SPOILERS FOR THE OTHER DAWN OF THE DEAD.Yes the other dawn of the dead did have the satiric aspect that addressed abortion, racism, consumers, and politics/science; it just failed to put them in a context that made sense.  The whole fran is havin a baby ok so why dont we abort it lasted 2 mins and didnt have any effect on the rest of the original.  The new dawn of the dead does have a political/social aspect to it but it doesnt throw it out like a bat out of hell as the other DOTD did.
In this movie it is obvious the apocalypse is here and the human race just dropped a few notches on the food chain.  The zombies are vicious, quick, and just want to eat humans, and the zombies have only been around a day since it all started,unlike the original where the zombies have been around for three weeks and society is screwed up but no destroyed.
The original dawn of the dead zombies  couldnt believably or possibly have taken over the world or at least we arent shown anything that would make them seem capable or extremely dangerous. Please note the original zombies walked slow,  they didnt run like savage beasts for their prey.  Remember (in the original dawn of the dead) how the rednecks and the military are just have a fun-fest drinkin coffee, shootin zombies, laughin and tellin jokes.  Lets not also forget the biker scene where the bikers are just throwin pies right in the zombies faces just messin around with the zombies and the only time a few bikers get eatin is when they are caught in moments of serious stupidity.This next part is not as much comparison as it is showing a difference between the two dawn of the dead moviesIn the 1978 dawn the movie was focused on a group of 4 friends who decide to land their helicopter at a mall for the time being.  The new dawn focuses on a group of 5 people who are forced to run and find refugee in a nearby mall to get away from the hordes of zombies.  The characters who enter the mall meet up with 3 security guards and later take in about 6 other survivors. Ok the new dawn didnt want to focus on a small group of friends instead it wants to show a small amount of people strive to make a new society in a mall bc the only other place for refuge is a small island.  Both dawns involve an island but the new movie actually involves the island a little more.  Back to the characters.  The new dawn has characters that fill parts of an every day society just compacted into a few people.I could go into a lot more but i have said enough so in short the new dawn of the dead not only surpasses the 1978 dawn of the dead, it is possibly the best movie ever and is the favorite in my book10/10",Dawn of the Dead
548,13fan,******GREAT******,10,6 April 2004,"This is what a remake is supposed to be, Can't find one flaw with this movie. 10 out of 10. This will not be the last of Zack Snyder, he has talent. A must see for everyone. To bad he couldn't have directed The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The first 10 minutes alone are better than many movies I have seen in the past 5 years alone. actually you never even get a chance to take a break from the start of the movie it's like a 100 min rollercoaster ride that doesn't stop. I was a trying to be open minded going in the theater since I was some what disappointed in Texas, but once Dawn started I knew that this was going to satisfy my zombie hankering. It's been a while since we've had a really good zombie flick, really to long. romero should be pleased he is the master but it is nice to see other film makers respect his work. He should be proud!",Dawn of the Dead
549,fantaziusmalare,well done,9,13 April 2006,"I approached this remake with a great deal of skepticism, and quite frankly would never have bothered to watch it had it not been for the casting of the always impeccable sarah Polly. Her performance in this film sums up the great intelligence with which the entire film was constructed. At risk of sounding corny, it is a mass friendly contemplation on morality, consumerism and the value of human life, and it actually scares the pants off of you. The film takes it's time developing the characters beyond one dimensional zombie fighters and leads the viewer to invest themselves emotionally in the outcome of the players, which makes the horror all the more frightening. The film accomplishes this without alienating the audience and keeps fans of Zombie flicks highly satisified. Even if this is not your genre, it is well worth a viewing, in a very dark room!",Dawn of the Dead
550,SmokeManmuscle,A bit of a disappointment,7,16 May 2005,"I got this movie yesterday on a blind buy because I heard good things about it online. And while I will admit that it is better than the recent Resident Evil films, it is still lacking in some areas.I really enjoyed the first 10-15 minutes of this film because the pacing was fast and everyone is clearly panicking. Unfortunately, the film seems to hit a wall after this.Most of the characters are random and meaningless. There are however, two memorable characters. CJ, the head mall security guard, is a great character until his magical change of attitude halfway through the film. Also, the man on top of the gunshop, Andy, is the best character in the film. I felt much more empathy with him than I did with anyone in the mall, and he doesn't even have any lines except through a walkie-talkie. Furthermore, I agree that his character should be killed off, but they didn't do it as effectively as I would have liked.The whole appeal from this film is clearly the gore, with even nudity making several appearances. Most of it is over the top and unnecessary. Maybe if I was 10 years younger, it would appeal to me more. As it stands, the cheesy violence is forced and gets old quickly.The editing at the beginning and end of the film is tiring and annoying. Sometimes attempts at being artsy fail miserably, and this is one of them. When will directors learn that camera tricks and clichés don't make for a great film? The best zombie film I have viewed recently is still 28 Days Later. And by no means do I think that is the best the film industry could do. Just look at the Resident Evil games. If something of that quality could be transfered to the film medium, maybe a zombie movie would exist that is infinitely watchable. Luckily, I still haven't watched the original Dawn of the Dead, and I am very much looking forward to viewing it.",Dawn of the Dead
551,rooobes,Great zombie movie!,9,16 November 2004,"I gave this movie a 9. I thought ""Dawn Of The Dead"" was not a typical scary zombie movie. I haven't seen the original, which this movie was a re-make of, so I can't compare them. The movie kept your attention from start to finish. The plot was good. There is even some humor thrown in, which I enjoyed. There were some new faces starring in this movie alongside some well known actors, but they all did well. They had the stereotypical ""dumb"" character, (the one that makes you yell at the screen; ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU ARE SO STUPID!"") but you can't have a scary movie without him/her. ""Dawn Of The Dead"" scared me like it was supposed to, but didn't try so hard that it became ridiculous (like some other horror movies usually appear to me). The ending was left rather unresolved, so I am left to question a sequel. Overall it was entertaining and I would recommend it.",Dawn of the Dead
552,woljac88,surprising,6,19 December 2004,"i have yet to see the original, so i don't have anything to compare it to, so this is probably going to change. i hate movies, where characters are stupid, like going back to check on her husband, even though its obvious he's the living dead. however it was fun being a smartass and yelling at the screen littering the dialogue with sarcasm and cynicism. i was exceptionally pleased with the slow version of ""get down with the sickness"" and ving rhames was surprisingly strong. The pregnant lady and baby thing was pretty nasty, but i can see how this could become a cult classic very quickly. i am sure that some die hard fans of the original will call this crap, but we need remakes to give the newer generations a hint at what they missed, and what it took to get us here in today's cinema",Dawn of the Dead
553,Wiseau_Serious,Hands down the BEST zombie apocalypse MOVIE EVER MADE.,10,21 March 2014,"This film was made in 2004, I'm reviewing it today six years later and you know what? It's still the best. The only film that comes close rivaling this masterpiece is Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later. But when you watch the two in marathon viewing, clearly Dawn of the Dead 2004 will have the upper hand and stays in you for hours, maybe days, weeks, months and years. And to think this is Zack Snyder's directorial debut? Incredible.Now what sets Dawn of the Dead 2004 apart from the past and present zombie flicks and in between, is that bold, brave and beautiful. It astonishingly mixed realism, horror, suspense, comedy, action and drama that's rarely seen for its genre, if not until its arrival. The story's straight to the point, it's pretty basic in terms of zombie apocalypse but it all comes down on how well everything else besides the story is executed. And this is where Snyder shines; you can relate to any of the characters and each are so well done so kudos too to the actors, the special effects are insanely realistic, and most of all chaos is really felt in the film, and Snyder showed amazingly how hell breaks loose when the dead walks in your neighborhood.It's fast-paced, hence the comparison to 28 Days Later and a far cry to the originals. But that's what everybody likes. Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a very re-watchable film (did I mention the Unrated DVD is a must- have?), you won't get tired of it easily, you'll notice subtle stuff on each viewing and even more appreciate the vastly superior cinematography seen in zombie movies genre. That too, why this is the best zombie apocalypse movie ever made.",Dawn of the Dead
554,tunaspam,Don't even look at the cover of this movie.,3,29 October 2006,"if you've seen the original Dawn of the by Georgie A, you know that this movie completely sucks.it's straight up bad horror film, for three main reasons: there's NO PLOT at all, the characters are all a bunch clichés and stereotypes, and the zombies don't even look like they're deceased.I can't believe how terrible this movie was, i had such high expectations.Okay, so this movie opens up with the main protagonist of the story, she's a nurse that apparently works in the emergency room during the late hours of the night and (by coincidence) there happens to be a lot of ""strange"" patients coming in. She finishes her shift and goes home to her loving boyfriend who then takes a shower with her, they go to bed and are awakened by the neighbor's daughter who has been zombified. Her boyfriend checks it out only to be bitten (of course) and then tries to attack the only living flesh left in the room. Our woman escapes through the bathroom window and then manages to meet up with a rogue cop, and a gangsta with his pregnant (not to mention European) wife. They proceed to find shelter in a shopping mall and are apprehended by three security guards who are complete dicks and lock them up for no apparent reason. More characters proceed to flood into the mall and they're all stupid and worthless. They include an old woman, a teenager, a snobby bitch, a rich man, a priest, and a few others. I don't even remember all of them because they were so dumb. Anyway, they go through days and days of wasting supplies and arguing with each other. A few found their s at the hands of zombies (though there was one awesome scene with the gangsta and his wife, but i won't spoil it for you :)). After all the supplies seem to be used up, out heroes decide they have to find a place to go. They formulate a stupid plan and then proceed to carry it out. Oodles of gore and dismembermment later, the movie ends abruptly with an incredibly dull and obvious ending that just left you going... ""why did i waste my time?"" and ""I thought zombies were supposed to be slow."" there were some cool moments and a ONE (notice i say ONE) cool character (i won't spoil them for you), but that isn't nearly enough to redeem this movie of it's sheer pointlessness and stupidity. If you want a good zombie film, watch Shaun, Land, or 28 days later (where the zombies have a right to be fast, unlike this movie). Don't waste your time with this piece of junk. it sucks.Zack Snyder failed.",Dawn of the Dead

The thing I disliked most is the fast moving zombies. The slow/clumsy zombies from the Romero film give a lot more room for building tension. However these zombies lend themselves better to the fast pace of this film. Loved the start, didn't like the end too much. There was little in the way of character development. But the movie still kept you entertained pretty much the whole time.I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to this but I really wish Romero would do one more!",Dawn of the Dead

I did not totally like the style of the ending with the credits cut in with the video clips.

558,matildamother,Shop til you drop...then have some lunch....,8,21 March 2004,"Take a song and remake it, but don't just follow the original note for note. Make it your own.  I think this new version of DotD has succeeded in doing just that, and what a lovely song it is.  The zombie genre is my absolute favorite type of horror movie and I'm a big fan of the original trilogy (especially #1 - the best horror movie ever made, imo).  I don't think this remake is a disappointment at all.  It's excellent!!I've read comments about the movie's lack of plot.  I think the plot is very clear, actually.  The dead are coming to eat us!!!  What more does one need? Seriously - if I may be so whilst discussing a zombie horror movie - I think DotD told it's story quite well.  There are unanswered questions because that's the way it's supposed to be.  We don't know how this plague of zombies came to be and we never will.  What we are left with is the affect on the living and how the living copes with their predicament.  Not everything in life - or unlife as it were - is clear cut.  It can be unsatisfying and unsettling and that's just that.  No happy ending, no ending period.  Just trying to make it because that's what we do.  The living are running on instinct just as much as the undead here.I found the soundtrack to be very clever and integral.  Really brilliant song choices.  For example, I laughed with glee when I heard the Muzak strains of ""Don't Worry Be Happy"".  Then in the next moment appreciated the irony.  I don't imagine much joy under the circumstances.  The music conjured up such contradiction throughout the movie, and/or in some cases took on a whole new meaning, and really lent itself to the overall mood.Just sit right back...and enjoy and scream and laugh!!!  Suspend belief (it's make-believe, after all....but I STILL think it really could happen!! *snarf*)  Good characters, good acting, great special effects.  It's also chock full of symbolism if one chooses to zero in on it.  I don't worry that this isn't a faithful remake and I didn't want it to be.  I'll watch the original when I want to see the original.  I think this one stands on its own.",Dawn of the Dead
559,tenchagorda,"Could been so much better,worth one-watching",7,7 April 2010,"Sorry for my bad English :(Alright my real problem with this movie was the lacking of imagination and originality, it was just a rip off of any zombie or action film ever existed, it was just cliché after cliché, it was like if you take all the clichés in existence and bowl them into one cup. Though not everything, it has some pretty good scares and the suspense is good, also has a couple of good ideas like the conversation through the blackboard and the beginning is greatThis movie makes no respect to the original and does not improve it but is OK, a enjoyable movie.There is no character development at all, you don't care at all if everybody dies, well i exaggerated you care for them, but very little, most likely you want some of them to live and some of them to die, so there is a problem there, the acting is OK, i think they all made a great work for the lame characters that were given to them.The special effects are not so special, they are OK, some good, some bad, but this proves that special effects do not cover the terrible script.The setting is OK, much better than the original, because in this one it looks realistic, in the original it's just dumb, months and months and everything is just the way it was before. The comedy in this movie wasn't for me, it was just dumb, laughing just because a zombie died in a funny way? doesn't work for me.Well, i hated it but as a movie, is not bad, apart from the terrible script everything is OK, a fun time.7.1/10",Dawn of the Dead
560,too_one_be,I actually WANT a sequel...,9,14 January 2008,"I am a big, big, big zombie fanatic. I have a lot of and have seen a lot of zombie movies. I have not been a fan of the remakes though. I watched the remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and was greatly disappointed. Reasons being that they changed to much of the story. For example, (SPOILER!!) no one made it out of the house alive in the original, but in the remake Barbra is the gun toting bada** at the end of the movie. That chick was in a coma for almost the entire movie in the original. Anyway, back to what I was saying, remakes normally suck because to much is changed around and the original idea is lost. The new ""Dawn of the Dead"" keeps the original idea of the movie and builds off of it instead of changing it. Yes, the beginning was different, but it was a quick lead up to the mall. People goto the mall, people live in the mall, people leave the mall. That was the idea. A group of people trying to survive the worst thing possible and trying not to kill each other in the process. I do have to admit, of all the zombie flicks I have seen I prefer to see the running, faster type zombies because before that I always just thought ""just run through them"". When Ana's husband started chasing the car, I will never forget the reaction of the other people in the theater when I first saw it. Some were gasping and others were laughing. We had never seen a zombie run like that before. There is a much more action in the remake that keeps things going. I know that the remake of ""Day of the Dead"" is about to be out soon, and I am hoping that lightning will strike twice with this series. I would love to see another action packed thrill ride like I did with ""Dawn"". Lets just hope they build on the idea and not destroy it.",Dawn of the Dead

I cant say i liked it. It starts off poorly, not using enough time to build up to the disaster. I actually spent more time laughing than actually being ""scared"", simply because the survivors(not the zombies :) are so incredible unintelligent, only barely smarter than the zombies themselves. After watching a while, i really couldn't be afraid of the zombies, it seemed the only reason they managed to kill anybody at all, was because the survivors made one suicidal plan after another.On the other hand, the movie was somewhat entertaining when viewed as a black comedy instead of a horror movie.",Dawn of the Dead

563,cpf593h,AMAZING!!,10,21 March 2004,"Let me begin with the ending. DO NOT LEAVE DURING THE CREDITS ROLLING. If you do, you will miss so many things. My Husband and I went to see this movie on Friday night for the opening and we so impressed, we went back the very next day and watched it again. Seeing it twice in a row took nothing away from it. When we saw the film on Friday, we went with friends. After we left we all decided we needed a drink because we had all felt like we had been on a roller coaster that just would not stop! When you leave the cinema you are just freaked. You start thinking to yourself, what if this really did happen? How would you survive, what would be your plan? As we left the cinema which was also in a MALL we decided we could find better places to go that were more advantageous than a MALL. This new film in no way takes anything away from the original. Yes, the zombies are faster but they have evolved. I didn't really think that character development was all that important so for that reason I was not disappointed that the characters were not very well defined. Let's face it, the zombies are the true characters that needed defining and it was given through the film. I screamed, laughed, cried, screamed some more and applauded at points but as I said at the beginning, if you leave during the credits rolling you miss some very important points of the film. If I am being illusive it is because I don't want to give a thing away. Just keep in mind, you are going to see a film that is about zombies so don't get caught up in the character development or anything else. Sit back and buckle your seat belts because you are in for the ride of your life. Enjoy the film and watch it more than once. Don't compare it to 28 days because that isn't fair. They are 2 different films in their own rights. This film was awesome and to those of you who love to bring your kids to the cinema, DON'T!!!!!!!!!! This film could truly have them having nightmares for a long time. We noticed a lot of people with kids and ther ages anywhere from 6-13 and for me that was a bit much. I would never bring a small kid to see this one! If you read all these posts you can see that most adults are having a hard time with it so imagine the imaginative mind of a small child.

564,TomWarway,Better than the original?,10,6 January 2009,"In short: yes. Dawn (as I will refer to it) is not only one of the best zombie films ever made, it is one of the best films ever made. I realise that may sound like an exaggeration, considering it's not even in IMDb's top 250, but please, bear with me. Dawn has the most efficient and effective introduction of any film I have seen. For a start, it has extreme clarity. It doesn't treat you like an idiot, but doesn't force you to think about what's going on, which lets you concentrate on the unfolding horror/drama. It's also very short, yet doesn't leave out any unnecessary facts, and allows you to immediately bond with the characters. When you think about it, most other films either spend a great deal of time on characterisation, or go straight into the action, sacrificing emotional attachment. This doesn't. Then there are the zombies. A HUGE number of people complained about the fact that they run. Why? As a non-supernatural horror movie (it's implied that the zombification is caused by a virus), speed equals scares. The original Dawn, as much as I loved it, was a bit too light-hearted (yes, I know it was a satire, but a satire can be deep, too) with the main characters pushing over zombies and literally walking right past them. Fast zombies also make the film more believable; you can't imagine slow zombies actually causing the end of civilisation, can you? Finally, there's the characters. Sarah Polley is brilliant in the female lead, showing wit, ingenuity and emotion, and Ty Burrell (the guy who plays Steve) is genuinely funny. The script is also brilliant: believable, funny and, at times, heart-rendering, it easily stands up to the original.",Dawn of the Dead
565,FlameTheHybrid,"Eh, could have been worse...",7,16 January 2009,"When I first found out about this movie and it being a remake, I was like !@#$ this is going to be awful, considering mostly every horror remake I've seen has sucked hard.However when I popped this into the DVD, expecting horrible acting and scripting, I actually saw an entertaining movie that had some good moments...but it's just a bit silly...I mean just for comparability, I watched the original and it was a lot more serious. I mean, it had a much smoother story and was just more serious in my opinion. For example, in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Now to me, if you see a little girl with gray died skin, a half eaten mouth and her just !@#$ing standing there, not crying and !@#$, you don't go and try and help her, you just stay away from that !@#$.And the fact that ever since 28 days later came out with the 'running zombie' people now notice that this !@#$ is ten times scarier then the old walking zombie !@#$ no matter how many times George Romero tries to shove it down our throats that zombies shouldn't run because ""their ankles would brake."" !@#$, it's a !@#$ing zombie movie, I think we left physics behind when the dead suddenly started to walk.Now the script, the script isn't as bad as I thought it would be. However, compared to the original Dawn of The Dead, it seemed that they were rushing with the plot of something. I mean, 10 minutes into the movie and they're already in the mall. The rest of the script is o.k, not super, but an o.k However, by no means do I think the movie is bad. No. Just a bit silly.The original is a lot more serious however and will get more of a story out of it.",Dawn of the Dead
566,Cyril2122,"Artistic, and excellent, but not so scary",8,24 April 2004,"Well first you have to go in understanding Dawn is part of the 'splatter' subgenre under horror. Being grotesque is by far a higher priority than scaring you, which is fine. The film has few true scares in it and the atmosphere is never really so much frightening as hopeless.As a zombie movie I personally found it excellent. The 'thing' about zombies as movie villains is that they're unstoppable as a force and there's no safety in numbers, and in the end, they always win. That's very well conveyed in Dawn, which plays at times more like a documentary than a horror/suspense movie. (as an aside, I also enjoy the fact that the danger to the entire group never really comes from the stupidity of one person, though as always bad decisions lead to some consequences)The passage of time as hopelessness accumulates is exceptional, the use of music is incredible, and the 'feel' and pacing are rather unique. All in all as far as a quality movie goes I think it's really incredible but it never escapes its genre. If you don't see yourself enjoying even an excellent, high quality splatter movie, you can give this one a pass.",Dawn of the Dead

But when you watch the two in marathon viewing, clearly Dawn of the Dead 2004 will have the upper hand and stays in you for hours, maybe days, weeks, months and years. And to think this is Zack Snyder's directorial debut? Incredible.Now what sets Dawn of the Dead 2004 apart from the past and present zombie flicks and in between, is that bold, brave and beautiful. It astonishingly mixed realism, horror, suspense, comedy, action and drama that's rarely seen for its genre, if not until its arrival. The story's straight to the point, it's pretty basic in terms of zombie apocalypse but it all comes down on how well everything else besides the story is executed. And this is where Snyder shines; you can relate to any of the characters and each are so well done so kudos too to the actors, the special effects are insanely realistic, and most of all chaos is really felt in the film, and Snyder showed amazingly how hell breaks loose when the dead walks in your neighborhood.It's fast-paced, hence the comparison to 28 Days Later and a far cry to the originals. But that's what everybody likes. Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a very re-watchable film (did I mention the Unrated DVD is a must-have?), you won't get tired of it easily, you'll notice subtle stuff on each viewing and even more appreciate the vastly superior cinematography seen in zombie movies genre. That too, why this is the best zombie apocalypse movie ever made.",Dawn of the Dead
568,sargJaeger,one of the best horror/splatter movies in decades,8,16 March 2005,"This movie really ranks in the top five of my all-time favorite horror movies. And i've seen dozens ( only counting the good ones). It has everything a good horror movie needs. It has suspense, atmosphere, shockers, gore and a great ending.A big plus are its characters. They may seem a bit stereo and movie-typical, but somehow this absolutely doesn't matter. Yes, there's the smart, modest and sacrificing hero, but this just fits the genre and is made so pleasantly. Many bad horror movies try this recipe, and hopelessly fail.I was actually surprised how gory this movie really was. Finally a big and successful movie with real gore. And WITHOUT annoying CGI. The zombies simply looked, moved and DIED great. This movie must've been made by people, who really love this genre.The story really caught me, with many nice ideas and a very good pace. There is no moment of boredom nor does it ever feel hectically(well unless in scenes where a certain hecticness comes natural). It really really delivers the feeling of what happens in their world and let's you join the(ir) ride.",Dawn of the Dead
569,shadowvssonic,A good movie but not at all scary,10,20 March 2004,"The movie is basically just like House of the dead! I won't bore you with a bunch of plot explaining, but i do love the action which is why I give this movie a ten!! it is really worth the 10 bucks for the ticket, its packed with blood and gore and a few emotional and funny scenes! I personally never saw the Romero original so i can't judge and compare the two but I do know that this movie is very good and will hopefully stay in the theaters for a while, this movie is a real ""Popcorn muncher"" There is nudity but it is at the end for about 2 seconds so for those who are worried about nudity its not packed with it like most horror movies. I really hope that you go and see this movie!",Dawn of the Dead

Silly summer fun, with no real message...a good way to turn off the brain and have a few chills.

571,randalthor1812,Great film,10,28 April 2005,"Has to the best horror with action film I've seen , the style , gore and pure tension is just superb. The DVD version i just watched has got great extra's that definitely add to the film . the reason i think that the film has such a great feel is that the gore and effects are spot on not the over kill of some , where lets just splatter some more blood on just ends up ruining the effects like so many old horrors do e.g Hammer or Romero.If someone suffered injuries they looked like they ought to , the special effects guy should get some sort of an award . I thought the fact that the zombies could move quickly was a good idea after all why not , its not like they are going to get tired of running like we do is it ! All in all better than the original in thats it looks and feels real in a way that Romero would love to have been and just wasn't.",Dawn of the Dead
572,Paradoxchairmen,Remakes can be good. Who'd of thought?,10,6 April 2004,"One enamole that has seemed to escape the foray of modern cinema is the fact that someone could take an already magnificently executed plot and put the just right spin on it as not to come off as redundant.  You'd think with all the talented directors in Hollywood this would've happened by shear hit and miss before 2004.  But nonetheless, the art of film remaking takes a well-waited turn for the best in ""Dawn of the Dead"".  No doubt inferior than the original, (Just saying otherwise would have me condemend to the fiery depths of Movie hell with the likes of ""Fast and the Furious"", and ""Freddy Got Fingered"".) this film does stack up well next to Romero's ingenius 1978 opus of the same name.  It rivals it if you will.  This in my opinion is mainly in part of the fact that it's more or less it's own stand alone movie.  Save for the occasional exception or in-joke.  I mean when Ken Foree made his cameo and repeated his famous line from the original I literally jumped in my seat and almost wet myself. The people around me stared at me and presumaby made mental retardation jokes at me later thus destroying my faith in the movie going public but that's neither here nor there.  Anyway the bottom line is with a great remake like this finally gracing our presence the catch-22 of the whole ordeal is this will simply inspire more Hollywood remakes.  I find ""Based on a screenplay..."" to be one of those long lost credits becoming trendy again.  Well it could be worse.  They could remake ""Walking Tall""   (Hah, ha, Well I gues I walked into that one)",Dawn of the Dead
573,Rj34594,Not Bad!,8,6 April 2004,"Probably the best remake of a horror film ever to grace the big screen. Loved the beginning, I even got the sense they did actually try to start off from the remake of Night of the Living Dead over ten years ago here.Obviously this is a remake of the original but it isn't. 'What?' you must be thinking. It has the same concepts using the Mall etc, but it does have the right to be its own film. There are a lot of new characters, new stories and it is not an exact remake of the original. After the first three minutes of the film its mainly all out action with a slow 15-20 minutes in the middle where they added a little humour which I enjoyed. The Burt Reynolds part was brilliant. Thought they could have done more with the baby. They could have at least had the little blighter bite somebody. There are a lot of positives here for the hardcore horror fans. We have a decent enough script, decent acting, decent zombies and a lot of gore factor. The chainsaw parts are very good. Go into watching the film expecting a lot of fun and thats what you will get back in return. No real scary bits to mention unless you are pregnant.8/10",Dawn of the Dead
574,andyprendy1,Worthy Re-make,8,1 January 2005,"I approached this film with much trepidation. Although not an avid fan of Romero's original, I found the premise of the film fascinating.......the end of the world as we know it? a mysterious virus/plague/evil that reanimated the dead and turned them into vicious cannibals? Wow! in the right hands the story has all the ingredients for a great movie. I thought the remake was great. From the unusually sharp script to the believable acting of most of the characters ( the female lead in particular ). The use of Johnny Cash's ""When The Man Comes Around"" for the opening titles is one of the most inspired choices I have ever heard from an opening sequence. The film has many memorable moments, particularly chilling was the scene where the White House/Government spokesman answered terror stricken reporters questions about the reanimation of the dead with the heartbreakingly honest reply .......""We don't know."" A sequel from the same director would be most welcome. I thoroughly recommend this movie, just don't turn off too many lights when watching....................",Dawn of the Dead
575,ExceptionalSunlight,As brilliant as a remake can be!,10,25 August 2004,"Now, I'm not really a stranger when it comes to zombie movies, having seen more than just a handful of them. But I think that it is still safe to say that this movie certainly is among the lines of one of the better zombie movies out there.I can't remember ever having been that impressed with any 'modern horror movie' for a while now. There isn't a single aspect about this movie that I could have imagined to be better. Although there are a lot more characters than in the original, each of them does manage to maintain a different personality which therefor doesn't make them appear to be just 'fill-ins'. The gore and effects are undeniably amazing and there are scenes that might even make the biggest gore fans cringe (chainsaw). What's also interesting is that this remake manages to capture the same dark humor as well as the claustrophobic feel (although not as intense) as the original. There isn't a single minute that's remotely 'boring' (even though many people will deny it, it's probably even more exiting than Romero's version) and it has some nice twists in it. Overall, this is an amazing movie that I would recommend to anyone ..",Dawn of the Dead
576,rycke,"Rethinking, instead of remaking, was brilliant",9,21 November 2004,"I'll admit I was VERY leary when I first heard the news. But first-timer Snyder hit the IL' zombie right on the nose... While I could never slam Romero's groundbreaking original, this update was well worth the remake, unlike the '90s version of NOtLD. The pacing and intensity of this new version certainly matches the frantic energy of today's lifestyle, and truly seems to update the story, bringing it into the modern world. I was even pleased with a number of the characters. CJ had a great character arc, and many of the others were reasonably well-rounded (especially coming from the Hollywood horror factory, if you know what I mean). Andy was an interesting touch. So--will Day of the Dead find a modern retelling?",Dawn of the Dead
577,jayschlike22,A horror movie that finally gave me nightmares,9,25 April 2005,"It's been years since a horror film left me thinking, DAMN that was pretty darned scary. Last film that did that was SQUIRM, and i was 6 years old. Why does this movie work ? Well, some people won't like this comment, but RUNNING ZOMBIES. Yes, it's a new Hollywood trend, but the fact these human eating fools can run as fast if not faster than you is absolutely terrifying and helps make this one of the better zombie films made in my opinion. Solid script, solid writing, surprisingly great acting, and I think Romero himself might be impressed slightly . However, unlike the original which showed a perspective on ""society"" as a whole , this movie tends to be more for action and scares. Which works for me. Because when I think of zombies, i want to run and hide, not get a lesson on life's inconsistencies and pitfalls. This movie is fun, scary, and if zombies took over the world, this is the way I would NOT want them to be. Which means I was scared and eating popcorn for 2 great hours of movie theater fun.",Dawn of the Dead
578,amicsenyi,I was freaked,8,27 January 2006,"Decided to watch this at night, alone. Not a good decision. Needless to say, by the end of the movie I was pretty freaked out, so much so that I had to do a quick sweep on my tiny 3 room apartment before being able to sleep. So, as far as I'm concerned, mission accomplished.I started watching it not knowing if I really wanted to devote 2 hours to it, but after the first zombie attack the action was so quick and intense my heart was racing and I couldn't turn it off even if I wanted to. The plot is so-so. Acting is good, being a horror flick, I understood that you couldn't really get attached to anyone, since they could die at any time, so I'm thinking that was why character development was minimal. The movie excelled at making the viewer tense and as uncomfortable as possible. Something about being stuck in one place while the world around you deteriorates gives me the creeps. And this movie conveys that feeling perfectly. It was gruesome, fast paced, dark, and scary. Everything a horror film should have.A good horror flick overall. For maximum effect watch alone in dark.",Dawn of the Dead
579,kenn-alcantara,Classic zombie movie never gets old,8,4 January 2014,"I decided to review this movie because of my love for zombie movies, from the slow-paced walkers of ""Walking Dead"" to the fast-paced runners of ""28 days later"". Well, speaking of fast-paced zombies, this movie definitely took me to a one thrill experience. I have not watched the work of George A. Romero back in 1978 but the name Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen) as the director of this remake gives me all the reason to watch this movie. Remake or not I think it is a solid movie for zombie fans like me. I love the storyline, actors, and the pace. All the factors that you are finding for a zombie movie is in here.Maybe, you are wondering why my approach towards this movie is overly- biased but for me what's not to like? Perhaps, it cannot be compared to the greatness from the classic 1984 Dawn of the Dead but this move from the production companies to remake this movie definitely reached out a of lot people in this generation to give rise yet again to the true horror of zombies especially it was written by George Romero himself. I think I shall let the movie do the talking, enjoy! :D",Dawn of the Dead
580,Jeremiah_Wozabblefrog,Weak horror movie and pointless remake,3,28 May 2005,"Where's the sense of inescapable doom that made the original DAWN OF THE DEAD so compelling and disturbing? Aren't all these people trapped in this mall just a little TOO chipper and chirpy considering the fact that the world is coming to an end around them--not to mention the little matter of the HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ZOMBIES MILLING AROUND IN THE STREETS OUTSIDE WAITING TO EAT THEM???And just how does a dead body, on instantaneous resurrection, start running around with the perfect physical coordination of an Olympic sprinter anyway? Maybe, just MAYBE, being dead meat and all, they MIGHT, y'know, stumble and shake and shuffle and twitch a little?Weakly plotted, full of poorly written, unconvincing characters, and never a tenth as scary or as memorable as the original.

581,zujka_87,Ordinary Film About Zombies,5,28 December 2005,"So, what can I say about this film? I don't know why, but I do not like films about zombies anymore. Why? Because it is boring. A lot of directors choose zombies as the main characters in their horror movies. So, the films are very similar. ""Dawn of the Dead"" isn't an exception. On the other hand, this film about zombies is one of the best movies from this category. The director Zack Snyder showed really monstrous and realistic zombies (the amount of them was really big!) but they were stupid and heavy-footed like others. Moreover, I liked the acting of Sarah Polley (Ana) very much. This actress was a discovery for me. There is a lot of action in ""Dawn of the Dead"". Mostly, the scene is laid in a supermarket and in the cars. The actors lick the dust one by one and this fact frightens the film viewers. Especially I liked the end of ""Dawn of the Dead"". Only one or two people stay alive in the end of simple horror movie. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is an exception! Every character of the movie was killed by hungry and mad zombies...",Dawn of the Dead
582,heaven-heaven,"Fast Moving, and that's just the Zombies!",9,23 February 2006,"At last, a re-make that's good to watch. It's rare to find a re-make that has the perfect balance between the plot of the original and a few new features of its own. The zombies move at speed, but this is supposed to be set in the immediate aftermath of their death. Think about it for a moment, the creatures have only just passed away and the rot hasn't taken hold of them or eaten at their muscles.The director handles the atmosphere perfectly. The viewer is taken from the calm of the night before and is plunged into the nightmare and chaos of the day after (and all within the first ten minutes).If you're looking for the same feelings that the first version managed to generate, then see the first version. The re-make is faster, and full of gore, and is in many ways better suited to the age in which it has been made. The simple truth is that a film like the first version would flop at the cinema in the same way as a novelist in the style of Jane Austin wouldn't make a packet in the modern era. The cinema-going audience expects everything to be fast and bloody, and that's precisely what you'll get if you watch this film.The best way of describing Dawn of The Dead is to imagine a mixture of Day of The Triffids meets 28 Days Later and throw in a touch of Night Of The Comet for good measure. All in all, Dawn of The Dead is an excellent film and what it may lack in dialogue it more than makes up for in fast action and good acting.If you haven't already seen this film then rent it at the weekend, but make certain you keep watching after the boat sails off into the sun. I'm afraid that I left the cinema as soon as I thought the film had ended and, when someone told me about the ending that unravels whilst the credits are coming up, I had to wait to rent it out once the DVD was on the shelves at the video shop. The final scene is amazing.The only problem with the film is that the characters are all ordinary people with no combat experience and yet they handle themselves and their weapons with the professionalism of trained soldiers. For example: I would have liked to have seen Anna struggling a little longer with the re-animated fat woman, but if that's my only criticism, I guess I should have given the film ten stars and not nine.",Dawn of the Dead
583,PyroPlasmX,"Good movie, bad movie-going experience",8,28 March 2004,"I recently saw this movie in the theater and I can say it was one of the better horror films I've seen in a while. There was a decent amount of suspense and quite a few moments to make your heart skip a beat. The action was good and there was plenty of in-your-face action with tons of blood and gore. This movie also had a pretty good sense of humor, which you are seeing in more and more horror movies, but this one was funny without being funny as to ruin to horror.My biggest complaint was the crowd at the theater I went to. The place was pretty full, which I expected, but I wish I would have waited a day or a week to see this. It seemed like every time someone killed a zombie the audience was clapping and cheering like football fans after a touchdown. I tried to count their loud clapping and cheering sessions but lost count at around 10. It's almost like they were surprised by the level of action. Anyone who knows Romero's Dead series know you'll see some intense bloody action and plenty of brains on the wall. But clapping and cheering every time a zombie loses their brains is like cheering every time a pitcher throws the ball, it's going to happen a lot. I think clapping during a movie gives you no more enjoyment of the film and can diminish the experience of those of use who just want to sit and watch the movie. So overall I would give the movie itself a B or 3 1/2 out of 5 stars and I would give my movie-going experience a D- or 1 1/2 out of 5 stars. And just remember you're at a movie, not a Metallica concert.",Dawn of the Dead
584,Snowy_Hawk,Unconvincing Ana.,5,22 September 2007,"The main character Ana, played by Sarah Polley was just unconvincing. She serves as the moral one of the group, a know-it-all about the Zombie plague, unless the other characters were as brain-dead as the Zombies howling for the flesh, i could not see how this group could have thought up the idea of the mall. I'd have a rough guess that she would have figured the head shot out if had not been for television. Don't think I'm sexist but i cannot believe that a woman, who is a nurse at a hospital, survived to the point that she got to the mall. *Spoiler* When her group goes into the mall and are attacked by the first Zombie, not only did she pick up the fallen shotgun and wound the zombie despite the fact that there was another guy there with a gun, but she didn't give the shotgun back to the trained professional who had a shallow cut on his wrist, not a accuracy dampening wound. This era of female hero's can be believable if played by good characters, if Jennifer Garner played this role, not only would it have worked it would have been a bigger hit. Throughout the siege Ana single-handedly figures out that the bites transfer the infection and guilts and manipulates Michael. Overall, Ana's character was just unconvincing.I must add that getting a head shot is extremely hard unless you are a professional, and honestly the only looking professional there was Kenneth, and Andy (but he owns a gun shop, he has training). I noticed that most shots in the movie hit their marks making this group better then an average Army fire team, despite being a Security guard, a nurse, a thief, a truck driver, a Jackass (Steve), his girlfriend?, etc.",Dawn of the Dead

If you like scary thrillers, this could be the movie you've been waiting for. If you like comedies this could also be a good movie for you to see. It all depends on what kind of movies you're into, and what you're looking for in a movie.But that's just me, you know.

586,freejack21usa,Surprisingly Good and Fun,10,20 March 2004,"Great film.  Just as good as the original but for different reasons.  You can never remake a film, so this re-imagining rocked.  This isn't the 70s, something needed to change.  After 30 yrs of zombie films some things had to change, and it worked.  people aren't going to react the same to Zombies as they would in the 70s.  If a some stumbling slow zombie came running towards you, I am sure a 12yo would know what to do.  The film had to change some things to make a Zombie film frightening in modern day.Also a loved the strong female heroine.  The chick in the last one was so weak and annoying.  This film benefited with the new idea of the kick butt chick, who does what she needs to do to survive.  It also has intentional humor in it, something old horror fans will aprreciate.  It was just a rocking good time.  As far as scariness they did as much as they could with a R rating.  Got away with some gross stuff too and a few good scares.The characters, and acting was really amazing.  The acting in the original was HORRIBLE.  So I'd say the the two films are equally good for different reasons.Also stay for the credits, there you will see the true ending.

Then we put in Dawn of the Dead remake Unrated Director's Cut. I remember saying ""Holy s@%!"" about 28 times during this movie. It is a perfect blend of horror, comedy, action, some romance, and erotic (yes, there are topless women). The storyline was so good, I was actually checking the windows all night. I really felt like I was in it. I would give more away, but most other people posting reviews have described it. People trapped in mall, surrounded by Z-men, etc. To wrap this up I have a few last words. Excellent blend of genres, lots of action, some nudity/sexual content,enough swearing to make a biker blush, and lots of gore and blood.However, no remake is as good as the original (though it is pretty close). I recommend it for adults, but keep the lights on. Definitely not for children.",Dawn of the Dead

I shall try to find that somewhere. Anyways, lets get back to breastax (as Madeline Kaun would say) and talk about this version. I thought the effects were very well done, and its realism is what really makes this stand out amongst competitors. It's just so amazing that they can take a plot that's so out-of-this-world and make it believable. This isn't to state that its plot is not predictable at times, but unlike lets say... The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, it doesn't get overly trying with predictability. No, this film becomes exciting and original for its realism and also for its moments that catch you off guard. Without ruining anything I'll just say there's one such moment near the end where I was shocked by an incredible mishap.For these reasons I rate this film: WOW.

What happened to the budget. It must only have cost a couple of million of quid to film and completed in about a week. It started of with promise but as soon as they got to the mall the story had nowhere to go. So it went back to the old faithful and have stupid people doing stupid things just to move the plotline along. These films have always been awful at showing the dead and this is no better.

593,stanleygoodspeed99,A new dawn is upon us...,10,1 July 2009,"and it is significantly better than the Romero version. That will hurt a lot of people to hear, but this movie is, quite simply put, the best zombie movie ever made. It is so for 4 main reasons.1. Characters. The characters are fantastic and well thought out. You learn more about them going through the movie, but you don't learn too much as to waste time finding out about insignificant details. Rather than be a commentary on society like Romero's, you see more of the personal conflicts of each character and see how they grow.2. Plot. You don't learn too much about what is actually causing the zombies, which is nice in this genre. It means that no one had to spend a whole bunch of time coming up with a scientifically plausible reason for the zombies being around, all that your given is the basics. You find out what causes people to become a zombie, what a zombie looks and acts like and how to kill a zombie. Nothing overly complicated or to be puzzled about. They are the zombies, either shoot them or run away. That's it.So what's it about if it's not about a cure? Escape. Where to go to be safe? Are the doors locked? How can we get away? The plot focuses on demonstrating the circumstances are becoming more and more dire and the characters should be (and do) becoming increasingly desperate. As there is no time spent on explaining why, time is spent focusing on the surroundings, survival and what to do next. The immediacy and imminence of everything that occurs in the movie also serves to make sure the audience aren't bored or spend too much time thinking ""that's what I'd do in that situation"", they just hold their breath and hope their favourite character makes it.3. Special effects. On the DVD there is a great section on each of the main zombie ""splatters"" which really makes you appreciate even more the special effects in the movie. They are brilliantly and seamlessly filmed and only add to the fear and panic being experienced by the viewer on behalf of the characters in the movie.4. (and my favourite part) the soundtrack. Amazing and satirical, this soundtrack probably requires a bit of a musical knowledge to appreciate. But from the man in black to lounge against the machine, the music just suits what is going on in the movie. Unlike other Snyder movies, such as Watchmen, the soundtrack doesn't detract from the happening in the movie or overwhelm the viewers when watching a fight scene by distracting them with a popular song they no doubt will recognise. The subtle satire and use of a normally loud song played softly is nothing short of brilliant.Truly, the main thing Snyder did that really makes this movie worth watching is not try to copy Romero in any way in his movie. This is simply a namesake, that has zombies and that's it.A sensational, awe inspiring flick. And to top it off, there isn't your classic good guys get away ending. Its great that it just gets left hanging.",Dawn of the Dead
594,tenacious_c2003,So much better than expected ***********Spoilers**********,10,19 February 2005,"***********Spoilers Within********** When I first hear they were remaking Dawn Of The Dead, I imagined it would turn out much like any number of movies that should have never been remade. I swore up and down never to see it, and when it actually got better than average reviews, and was #1 at the box office for a few weeks, I simply thought ""well, there must not be anything else better playing"".Usually when I watch a crappy movie, I turn to someone in the room and say ""wow, I could have made a better movie than that"" (yeah, I'm THAT guy). However, after a friend of mine brought Dawn Of The Dead over, I said ""If I was going to make this movie, that's exactly how I would have done it"".The remake of DOTD is probably one of the best horror movies I have seen. It has enough blood and guts to satisfy the gore freaks, but not too much to offend the casual viewer. I also really liked the (intentional) humor throughout the film. What really surprised me is that unlike most horror movies, you really get to know and care about the characters (most of them at least). You cheer when some of them die and frown when others stay alive.In most movies, the characters are quite two dimensional, and you can generally pick out from the first five minutes which ones will live and which ones will die. With this movie, villains become heroes and heroes become villains. I wanted so badly for the character of CJ to die, but by the end of the movie, I was sad to see him go.All in all, this was a wonderful remake, and I hope remakes of other movies are just as good as this one.",Dawn of the Dead
595,Shizznit25,Dawn of the Dead 2?,10,13 November 2005,"This was such an excellent film that all horror fans should be raving about it until we get another in the same vein, perhaps a direct sequel signed over by Romero with Snyder and a few of the original (remake) cast on board. And if we're all very lucky Snyder will try to outdo himself the second time around. Except for having the same name and being about zombies it's kind of hard to really call this a remake or even compare it to the ""original."" They really are two entirely separate films, with two separate attitudes, ethos, and for lack of a better word, feel. It's pseudo-political timing, which every serious film that uses explicit amounts of sex or violence must ultimately be, was perfect, the escalating war in Iraq, the building of fundamentalist religious fervor bordering on madness, the almost simultaneous... compare and contrast me even though I have absolutely nothing to do with... release of the ultra-violent ""Passion."" I must have been glowing a dark, dark, shade of, zombified, almost black, red, when I walked out of the theater after having seen it the first time. It frightened me! It truly frightened me. I can't remember the last time a horror film frightened me. Maybe it was the first time I saw the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but I'm not sure. Please, please, please, art people and production people and finance people and Zach and Sarah and Ving and Kevin, and hoards of apocalyptic terrifying, fast and frightening zombies...come back!

596,Maxsil,Not nearly as good as the original,5,22 July 2011,"Well, i admit i didn't expect anything from this remake, but i actually got a bit surprised. The plot is rather well-written (even if it's a remake) It's rather consistent and easy to follow, but not extremely dumbed down either. The characters are easy to follow and they aren't that annoying (sometimes they are incredibly stupid like in every movie)However, as you might expect it's full of different clichés such as the ""shaky camera"" during action where the camera shakes like the cameraman got an epileptic seizure, or the ""extremly fast fading camera"" where YOU might get an epileptic seizure.And in some instances the music has to do all the dramatic acting, and on top of that the music usually spoils some surprises, in that it always gets dramatic when something dramatic is going to happen.But overall it's a pretty good movie, however the original still tops it.",Dawn of the Dead
597,beretta92fs_inox,Several reasons to say this movie sucks,5,26 January 2005,"1. They say the zombies aren't intelligent but looks like they're enough to only try to get in the gunner's store when he opens the passage. Oh yea and then the gunner twisted in zombie shows a panel full of blood. This is dumass. Also a ""stupid"" zombie picks up the gas tank that CJ throw at them. Zombies can't do that they too stupid resident evil was much better well the first movie the second a little sucked.2. When that girl's husband get bitten by her daughter he turns into a zombie like 1 minutes later and the black guys wife took days to turn into one.3. When they all get out the mall with the trucks it's night and 5 minutes later its like afternoon. This was stupid too.4. Is the entire world infected or its just an area they don't mention it.5. None of the people are afraid they seem natural.6. Why doesn't the zombies eat the dog, what attracts them to the humans in the mall?? 7. The music is awful. It doesn't fit the movie at all well if its a horror movie of coarse because it was funny than scary to me.8. One of the zombies in the mall was eating an other zombie laying on the floor. If they can eat each other why doesn't the zombies near the mall eat each other? Well there's a few more stupid stuff but would take a while writing them.Anyway I give 5/10 its all I can give. Might be OK and you got nothing to do but personally I think there's nothing to enjoy",Dawn of the Dead
598,dan-708,Best Zombie movie in quite a while,8,31 March 2004,"While there are many zombie movies I have not seen this was just about my ideal splatter-flick. Tonnes of action, lots of tension, decent pacing and enough humour to make you at least smile and remember that it is only a movie.I doubt it will be up for any awards any time soon, it was as one of my buddies put it ""What 28 days later wanted to be"". I never saw the original as it looked too ""B-movie"" for me but I am seriously considering making a dash to the video store today to pick it up.I will definately be buying this one on DVD when it comes out, and may even go back and see it again at the theater!",Dawn of the Dead
599,me_downtowngal,This is one hell of a horror movie.,6,11 July 2011,"This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.",Dawn of the Dead
600,kfmb,WAIT TILL THE CREDITS ARE COMPLETELY DONE BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!,9,20 March 2004,"One of the best zombie movies in a long time...okay, probably the best one I've ever seen.  Good character development even!  It was gory, but the kind that makes you go 'ewwwww'...not yuck.  Had the needed 'what a jerk' kind of guy that you loved to hate.  Had a few funny moments.  Had it's fair share of jump out of your seat moments.  And, had a ton of 'Get your butt out of there' scenes too.  If you enjoy this sort of film, go see it.  You'll not be disappointed!  But, and this is a huge but, DON'T LEAVE UNTIL THE CREDITS ARE COMPLETELY FINISHED. The aisles were full of people who started to leave when the credits started to roll...AND IT'S NOT OVER!!

601,MemorEase,Wow...,8,6 May 2004,"I had a great rush seeing this film. It was creepy, funny and i really loved the zombie's! Very, very exciting! I didn't see the original, so it was a big surprise for me. I first saw the trailer, which made me very curious. So i just saw it and had a blast. The film immediately begins, after a small intro. I like that. Most films try to explain way to much about causes and all. Dawn of the Dead did not do that; Great!TEASER: It's a shame that the killings of the main characters are so predictable. The ones we meet (and like) in the beginning of the film all stick together... I wish there could be at least one or two surprises. Liked the chainsaw by the way... :)",Dawn of the Dead
602,spacism,I had fun getting angry at this movie.,6,17 November 2004,"(Possible Spoilers)Mildly interesting film plagued by ""wouldn't it be cool if...?"" moments, poor character decisions, and many more negatives. Normally I don't write reviews, but I feel the need to p*ss on this movie a bit. It should have been made under its own name and attempted to be its own movie, because as it stands, nothing matches up to the original. Whatever royalty money George Romero receives from the making of this film, he should use it to have those responsible for it shot.I'm sick of hack horror directors using strobe effects (think 28 Days) to make the zombies appear to move at high rates of speed. If it works in the haunted houses... Now, I'm not a fan of fast moving zombies, but they do bring something to the zombie movie genre, but it isn't something that is necessarily good. Why make them zombies at all? Why not people under the effects of a substance that makes them go crazy and attack others. It seems unrealistic to have these zombies behave the way they do after considering the damage done to the body. After a person is ripped to shreds, or succumbs to the disease after being bitten by the zombie, they would be reanimated with a seriously damaged body. Muscles and the brain would be deteriorated, it isn't plausible for the reanimated bodies to get up and start sprinting like Carl Lewis. As opposed to the machine like zombies in this film, the zombies in Romero's films are convincing. You expect a dead person to move with difficulty and in a state of confusion, once you accept that they can move at all. I'm extremely turned off by the herky-jerky motion, and feel that it takes the viewer out of the reality of the situation. The movie becomes slick and like something out of a video game. One second the person is dead, the next, they are alert and running around. Another major problem I have with the movie is the noises made by the zombies. The zombies have all have a generic computer generated (artificial) way of moaning and hissing. A genuine, expressive, human cry of pain is much more terrifying than a zombie who runs his voice through an amplifier hooked up to a distortion box and an echo pedal. A zombie could easily front a NuMetal band should the whole running around killing thing get boring.The characters are rather thin, and not just the ones we see and hear a line of dialogue from every 25 minutes. I never really believed that Andre (or anyone, ever) would do what he did. Take the standard cliché ""I know she is going to turn into a zombie, but I love her, so I will hide it from everyone"" and add ""wouldn't it be cool if this happened?"". I don't see why he would accept the baby that burst out of his dead/zombie wife and then shoot another person to protect it. By the way, the baby's awful scream was cringe worthy. Another major problem is the event that brings about the climax. Nicole takes a truck and places herself in a situation involving certain death, and she does this all for a dog she just met. I could accept this as an example of someone losing their mind under the stress, but why does the group, who up to this point was reluctant to save anyone, rush out and put themselves at risk. This event leads to a situation where they must flee their sanctuary, they do save the girl but lose some of their team, and the zombies are allowed to enter the mall. They must evacuate the mall without time to prepare a proper escape. Never mind the ridiculous propane bombs, why didn't they use fire and bombs to clear the crowd of zombies out earlier? They could have been lobbing molotov cocktails down into the packed crowd and the fire would have easily spread among the infected. This would have cleared the way to the ammo shop, providing them with a ton of ammunition and cleared a path for the gun shop guy, Andy.Well, this is going pretty long. Let me just to list a few more annoyances; the girl shooting a shotgun from the hip, stick through a zombies skull, inappropriate music accompanying awful montages, not so clever used of a Disturbed song (2 counts), and the end credits interspersed with short clips of what is happening to the characters at the end of the movie..My final conclusion is that the film is interesting enough, not only to compare it to the original, but as a zombie movie. Even though it is hard to like a movie that goes so far to take a crap on one's suspension of disbelief, it is worth watching. Fortunately for it, the total is greater than the sum of its hack parts.",Dawn of the Dead
603,skibbleyboo66,"This... was an April Fool's joke, wasn't it?",1,30 April 2005,"No. No. No no no no no no no no no.Seriously - I sat there with my jaw slack, wondering if this was actually supposed to be scarier than a bunny in a field of flowers or better than a fetid pile of compost. Apparently, neither.It's true - there are some great special effects in this movie, what with the obvious green screens, as well as the explosions that just so happen to be exactly the same all throughout the movie. Ooh, pretty.And the gore factor is certainly there - because, of course, blood makes a good movie, the directors decided that it would be fun if they just randomly killed some people off by decapitation, dismemberment, and generally blowing brains out. No, literally. More than once you see blood splatter behind a zombie. But naturally, that's what I'm looking for in a good scary movie. Oh. Oh wait. No I'm not.The storyline? Wait. Whoa. A STORYLINE? You'll have to forgive me, because I didn't notice. Well, that's not true. I did notice the endless clichés, and the fact that the storyline was only exactly the same as in Resident Evil, except now Hell has run out of room. (An unfair comparison, considering the original came well before RE, but this is the one time that even under the law, this does not necessarily deserve a fair trial.) In all seriousness, the storyline (as well as the rather odd side plots) was actually more offensive than intriguing. Killing newborns (even zombified ones) and randomly picking off zombified celebrities, while supposed to be shocking or humorous, are poorly executed, and I can't find a single example of a person who finds killing newborns humorous that isn't psychologically impaired. Give me a break.""But skibbleyboo66, the point of that plot is that the family went insane! It's supposed to make you sympathetic to their plight!"" Right. And I'm supposed to believe that having some stereotypical old lady duel a stereotypical African-American with a stereotypical family involved in a completely stereotypical zombie movie will make me sympathetic. I was sympathetic in the Exorcist, a similar movie in some regards (possessed children, scares not necessarily in the jump out kind, but the psychological kind), but with much, much, much less flawed execution.To the movie's credit, the soundtrack is really not too shabby. I enjoyed the jazz version of Disturbed (much more than the original), and, though completely unoriginal (like the rest of the movie), the music actually did strike me as better than the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, that's not saying much.The problem with this movie is really not the behind-the-scenes concept. It's really not. The execution that takes precedent over the concept is beyond flawed. Upon reflection, the movie really does remind me of the Exorcist, except I enjoyed the Exorcist. It boggles my mind, that America actually buys tickets and DVDs for this movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy, and after this review, I expect I'll have a few of them.",Dawn of the Dead
604,rip747,Awesome rework,8,20 March 2004,"First off, you should know that this is not a remake of the original movie, this is a rework. What is the difference? Remake is just that, a scene by scene copy of the original with a few new elements thrown in. A rework takes the basic concepts and elements from the original and gives you a whole new movie.Now that we said that, the movie was AWESOME. Personally I think it was 10 fold better than what Romero put out in 1978. The zombies were better looking, scarier than the original, waaaaay faster and more intelligent. Which in my opinion would be exactly what a freshly dead person would act like.The acting was good. Rahmes did a great job, a real bad ass in the movie. Polly's performance was outstanding. She has some reals bug balls in this film and quick thinking (like remembering to grab the keys). The others performances were on par, I will admit, however that Pfier's acting abiliy was wasted. The role he got sucked big time. I wish they could have written in a better character for him.There wasn't ANY Romero type gore in the movie. The movie had more supence and close calls than anything else and relied heavily on that. There is alot of blood and some great kills, but nothing I think anyone hasn't seen before.I'm not going to tell you anything that happens the film other than saying that you should stay through the whole ending credits. :)Rating 8",Dawn of the Dead
605,janar_ks,Worthwhile to see,9,18 August 2004,"It had a really good start. Very terrifying. The tense was nevertheless palpable all throughout the movie. Characters were also very fine, no overplaying. There wasn't much text, but I didn't miss it - all the explanations. The drama, that was between the characters, was enough and well-played, unlike most American movies in my opinion. There was also not much time to pause and think very long during the movie, about what is going to happen to all these people on the roof. Everything went on smoothly and quickly, although in between I somehow seemed to miss some of the development, for example when did they decide to escape through the underground garage in the mall.The attempt failed, regarding some addition to the dead army. In conclusion I wish I hadn't seen the ending subtitles of the movie:) , then I wouldn't of known, what was going to happen to them on that island. I would have gone to bed, knowing the survivors lived through the tragedy, that fell upon human kind (""when hell is full, dead walk the ground""), although that would have made Dawn of the Dead just another usual ""happy-ending story"". Then again, I stress, this is definitely not some usual ""bad-ending story"" too! Every movie has to have an ending of some kind. I liked the music. It's hardly likely they survived on that island.

Watch Dawn of the Dead and see.,8,29 March 2004,"As a longtime fan of the ""Dead"" series, which has stretched out for over three decades, I wasn't sure how much entertainment I was going to get for my hard earned dollar, so I did the matinee thing.  I had nothing to worry about.  This movie had comedy, drama, a little love thing goin', some gore, some tension and some very nice acting.  The undead were even much more believable than in any of the originals.  I think the running sarcasm played out among the characters set the tone for the film which help offset the well-established tension.  I really enjoyed this movie, much more than I had hoped too, which is always a great surprise.Two popcorns way up!",Dawn of the Dead
607,Dubl_A,Remake? (or) 28 Dawns Later,7,16 March 2004,"First of all, I have to say that I am a Romero fan, and I did thoroughly enjoy this movie and would recommend it to any horror movie buff. IMO it blows all of the recent zombie flicks (28 Days Later in at a distant second) out of the water. It is as beautiful visually as it is grotesque. If you are late to the theater, don't bother seeing the movie at all. The first ten minutes or so before the opening credits are too perfect to miss.I won't sum up the movie because I hate *spoilers*, but I will point out a few of my reactions:1.) Most importantly, the movie deviates so much from the concept and spirit of the original that it almost seems inappropriate to call it a remake...and I don't know if that's a bad thing (how many really great remakes are there?). There are definitely some winks and nods toward the original Dawn (and at least one to Night), but they almost seem to detract from the new storyline -- which brings me to...2.) The story/script are really the weak link here.  The story seems really underdeveloped (there is no real concept of how much time is passing for instance). It feels as if the writer was trying to go someplace new but was afraid of straying too far from the original --and the plot suffers as a result.  Romero's screenplay was so unique yet so dated, and I feel that a better writer could have told a fresh and contemporary story while utilizing the strengths of the original.3.) Although I think this was a much stronger movie, I will admit that it resembles 28 Days Later a little too much.  The zombies are fast...I mean really freakin' fast. Many scenes are shot with that same digital high shutter speed look that's so popular with the kids nowadays (think CSI Miami). ""Zombism"" is even a blood-borne pathogen in the new Dawn (which really p***ed me off about 28 Days -- why don't we just call it AIDS? Everybody's afraid of that, right?).  Come on folks, does anyone even remember originality?All in all, despite its frailties, Dawn of the Dead '04 was one hell of a flick, and I'll probably see it again.  But I challenge you, hot young filmmakers of tomorrow: Come up with a totally new and innovative movie about zombies! One with the intelligence of 28 Days and the spirit of Night of the Living Dead, but one that is completely different. I've waited a long time for a movie like that...one to make old George proud. I thought for a fleeting moment that this remake might be it. It wasn't -- but it came closer than any movie in recent memory.",Dawn of the Dead
608,erich242,Was this a remake?,7,21 March 2004,"I saw this movie yesterday and found it to be a gory squelch-fest with beautiful undead effects  and the proper tension between the remaining few humans in the Mid-West, but I can't actually call it a remake. It has a mall and a cop and hordes of zombies but it is a different movie on every level. This has no real social underscore and their aren't two schools of thought on how to deal with the zombie problem, although they begin with a two camp face off that is quickly thwarted .I am a fan of this movie and I rated it a 7-8 out of ten, but the original (not to sound all film snob)is a better picture .If this film stood on it's own instead of having the same and being shadowed by a genre classic it would be viewed as a ""28 days later"" or ""Dellamorte Dellamore"". -Erich",Dawn of the Dead
609,fruitsaverer,Good but not as good as the original.,5,27 March 2004,"Good but not so good remake to the original fright flick lacks the brains of its predecessor and does not have its heart. Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames do well with their roles but the film really does not go anywhere with the time it has, and it lacks the bravado of the original film's climax.  My hats off to the director for keeping the body count high but shame on him for not getting too involved with his cast of characters, who in the original had some personality.  George Romero's original had a sense of real dread and a nightmarish view on human conflict but this movie is more popcorn than a real meal. Some genuine scares here and there but nothing else in terms of real human emotion.  Which is a shame because that what makes the original such a classic in modern horror.",Dawn of the Dead
610,Senor-Spielbergo,"At last, someone's got it right...",10,29 March 2004,"If you haven't guessed already, I can't sing the praises of this movie enough - at last, a zombie flick that is two very important things.1) Not a B-Movie; 2) An absolutely cracking A-Movie.Having just got back from the cinema still amazed with the quality of this film I don't know where to begin. The good acting, the spot on cast, the refreshingly unbearable scares, the ""Paul Verhovenesque"" completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore, the almost uniquely un-Hollywood ending... It's all there.What is even more amazing about this movie is that it's [re]creators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience. There are no unwanted and unnecessary messages of family values, cheese, cuddles, and love will conquer all, which is fabulous because it leaves far more room for classic lines like, ""Tell him to shoot Burt Reynolds"" and then the ketchup-tastic head shot that follows. Now you have to admit, that line really can't fit perfectly in to many movies but in the ever consistent mood of Dawn of the Dead, it's right at home.Ving Rhames is easily the second best thing in the movie (second only to the fast moving, constantly hungry and occasionally limbless zombies) once he actually starts speaking, and it is welcoming that Sarah Polley's Ana is as composed as she is subtle which is great for the audience because for a change the lead female character is not screaming every 30 seconds because, oh my god, someone is trying to bite me whilst drooling oodles of blood and saliva all over my nice white t-shirt. again!Her character is only clichéd and therefore flawed once throughout the campaign. As the genius of the group, she is the first to work out that when people are bitten they become very ugly, very quickly and develop a penchant for biting others. However she is still inexplicably opposed to killing the aforementioned soon-to-be cannibals. I don't know about you but whilst she was still talking through the morale dilemma of killing would-be zombies before they turned, I'd already be choosing which sponge I was going to use to clean my shoes after removing my trusty shot gun from a red blob that used to be somebody's face. Maybe that's just me though. us Sagittarians are very impulsive.Since we all have limited attention spans and I'm mindful of not giving too much away about what happens in the move, I'll wrap up by saying that those of you out there who enjoyed this film's original version and have gone on to enjoy films like Starship Troopers, Robocop, Resident Evil etc., then this is definitely the film for you. And even if the above are not representatives of your particular favourite genre, consider this. I went to the cinema with four friends tonight, one of whom stated before paying his money for the ticket, `I don't know why I'm bothering, I hate [rubbish] like this'. He was the one laughing the loudest and coming closest to vomiting throughout the film, and all of us came out saying, `how many Oscars has this been nominated for'..? Sarcastically - yes, but if it was nominated, it'd get my vote. The only thing that could have made it better was Steven Segal instead of Burt Reynolds but you can't have everything.",Dawn of the Dead
611,chris-m-c,Dire,5,27 October 2004,"It is not everyday that you would consider Romero's original a cinematic masterpiece, but compared to this abortion it's Citizen Kaine. If the creators of this movie had spent less time whacking off over each other and concentrated on what makes a good zombie movie then this could have been a better film than the original. Sadly it's not. The original had humour and an edginess that this film lacks. If possible it is even less feasible and the characters less believable than the original. The sole reason I stayed in the cinema was because of the obvious potential of the pregnant woman. ""Hooray, a high-cost special effect zombie baby would save this film,"" I said. After wading through the abysmal dialogue and one dimensional characters for what seemed like eternity (80 minutes is as long as this type of movie should last. Tops) as the original story was ""improved upon"", finally the feted scene arrived. Whoosh, it's over. And it was rubbish. Jackson's Brain Dead is my standard for reanimated infants and he did that on a tuppence ha'penny budget.

613,smut_husky,Bite Me,7,8 December 2005,"While the most loyal Romero fans might have you believe this remake isn't a patch on the original, this ""re-imagining"" as it should really be defined, is refreshingly good.In fact, this is probably the best example of a remake in some time, and adds a much needed shot of adrenalin into the rather lacking zombie genre.As i said before, this movie is less a remake and more a re-imagining of the original. There's very little in common with Romero's films, and the shopping mall aside, we're offered an entirely new cast of characters, a brand new scenario and a far less claustrophobic feel than the original. This movie tries to steer away from the safe and cautious frame by frame approach, and instead opts to go in it's own individual direction, affectionately referencing it's roots, without lifting too much.As a completely stand alone movie, and not in any way connected with the Savini remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"", this movie throws it's lead (played by Sarah Polley) straight into a zombie over-run world.The set up for the story is brief and speedy enough, but still manages to convey enough about the lead character whilst dropping hints that things are soon to go wrong. The pre-credit sequence is one of the most energetic moments in recent film history, acting as a highlight of the movie, and setting the scene for what's to come.Abandoning the relatively slow and scattered build up of the original, this movie, like it's zombies, builds up at a sprinting pace. The film is often relentless, and with the exception of a few questionable dialogue scenes, it's unlikely anyone might find the film a boring experience.However, the quick and unforgiving nature of the movie also offers up perhaps the biggest drawback. Unlike Romero's original, we barely get time to fully understand or explore the cast of characters. There is some effort to open up the various personalities (especially with the core group) but overall, we're offered two dimensional, hollow caricatures. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and for the general viewing audience, those on screen are entertaining enough in their various roles, but for those who enjoy a little character development, and valued the original movie's slow, ever unfolding pace, it might be hard to find any real handle with which to fully appreciate the characters.However, saying that, the primary players in this movie all fill their roles well enough. Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames and Jake Weber put in sound performances, and the secondary cast play their roles well enough, despite their being one too many clichés for my liking. Then again, it's good to see such a healthy and diverse cast in a horror movie like this.The gore-hounds should love this movie too. There's more than enough blood and cuts on offer, and more times than not, the moments of gore are far beyond what you might expect from a horror movie. Some real attention has been played to making the most of this gross-out moments, and while it might not be to everyone's taste, it should certainly appeal to those whose taste it does accommodate to.To conclude; this movie definitely knows where it's at. It doesn't delude itself to thinking it's high art, and doesn't try to convey any deep and meaningful message or make a comment on the state of society today. Although the Director's Cut of this does include some scenes of this nature (which in my opinion, just don't work) the theatrical release of the film finds just the right balance between the action, horror and drama, with more than a few moments of genuine humor thrown in for good measure.All in all, a strong example of the genre, and an impressive reinvention of the zombie sub-genre.",Dawn of the Dead
614,industrija666,Damn good remake,8,25 August 2004,"I was quite surprised with this movie. I was even so sceptic, and didn't wanted to watch it when i heard of it(remake). Pleasant surprise. Very good action scenes, lots of paranoia, great deaths, non-stop action and VIOLENCE - VIOLENCE - VIOLENCE. We'll see how RESIDENT EVIL 2 matches up with this movie. The only bad thing/good thing is that the original script was heavily re-done. I loved the zombie-baby idea, and the damn-fast zombie idea. It gives me even more creeps. They're more of a threat not being slow. What else to say, but heavily recommended. Remakes are a great business lately. I wonder will they ever do the ""Day of the dead"". Hmmm. Anyway, i give it 8/10. RECOMMENDED.",Dawn of the Dead
615,mncarrasco516,"I'm super squeamish and hate scary movies, but I'd recommend this flick.",6,1 April 2005,"My husband rented this and I was, annoyed- to say the least.He'd seen it before and I loathe slasher movies. I hide behind my hands during violent scenes in regular movies. (Although I must brag that I waited for hours to see ""The Blair Witch Project."") How could I be expected to watch a high budget zombie movie?The first 20 minutes were difficult. I kept asking if I should hide my eyes. The music and weird vibe of the opening scenes made me uncomfortable. I kept wondering how they were going to introduce the inevitable. I was edgy and creeped out by the, well- by the ""dawn of the dead."" I couldn't tell if Anna was the main character or one of those people they kill off at the beginning just to mess with you, like Drew Barrymore in ""Scream.""After the main characters were all introduced, my grip on the hide-my-face-pillow was loosened. I was thankful for the comic relief and the minimal gore within the confines of the shopping mall sanctuary. The special effects/make up were more than expected. Usually everyone looks like they're covered in beefaroni, but (as the special features on the DVD point out)these dead guys were modeled from forensic photographs. Sometimes the zombies are amusing, like the bloated woman who's so fat she's dragged in by wheelbarrow or the bumbling Burt Reynolds look alike killed off in a twisted version of Hollywood Squares. Other times the images are haunting, like the first zombie, a small girl with her lips ripped off or the woman accidentally killed in the get-away bus.""Dawn of the Dead"" was believable as what would happen if, dare I say it...zombies took over the earth. But what's with this?: The mall refugees' rooftop friend across the street is starving so they send a dog over with food. As expected, this plan goes awry. For crying out loud! They live in a mall. Why not go to the toy store and get an r.c. airplane and send IT over with a sandwich? ""Duh"" moments aside, my only complaint is the ending.The constant flipping between camcorder and credits was nauseating. All in all, I'd suggest this to a guy friend.",Dawn of the Dead
616,S-block,Movie that would have stood better on its own,8,12 October 2005,"First and foremost I love the Romero Originals and have been a fan of his for 13 years, I think ROMERO's originals outdid any remakes.That being said I absolutely loved this movie and felt it fit more into the world of 28 Days and the only let down was that it was TRYING to outdo the original Dawn. The original Dawn was much more of a slow moving character developing movie. The new one though does try to develop the characters it does not really manage (have only seen this in the Cinemas) its more of a survivor movie with flight or fight instincts being played out. Were the original layed out to be a deep thinking view of humanity the second shows how most people seem to form up in situations such as this.Have to say that if they gave it a different title and kept references to Dawn at a minimum it would have been a much different movie that even more of my steadfast Romero followers would have enjoyed.P.s they should have kept the line 'When theirs no more room in hell...' out of the script totally, there is only one movie that can claim that line.",Dawn of the Dead

This DOTD remake is a good horror movie, but it fails to convince me that it has any purpose other than to provide a piece of disposable entertainment. You watch it. You comment on how it ""lacks the subtext or intelligence of the original"". You forget about it. The classic DOTD can't be forgotten, it is so pointedly brilliant in its ideas, its editing, its directing, its entire execution. Okay okay, so the makeup effects have been vastly improved these days but once you dig down past the eye candy the 2004 remake has very little on offer. Give it another 20 years, people will still be talking about Romero's vision. The 2004 version will be lost somewhere in remake hell.",Dawn of the Dead
618,jkato0423,Zack Snyder is a racist bigot,2,20 November 2005,"The remake of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is far from a remake. The film was actually influenced by 28 Days Later directed by Danny Boyle. This fact explains the running zombies and the news broadcast of human figures beaten down by policemen.The original version had the subtext of criticizing consumerism, and the racial subtext was optimistic. The characters seemed to go along well despite the difference in skin color or profession.I found Zack Snyder's version offending. At the beginning of the film, the news broadcast of a zombie outbreak is shown, but also the audience see a clip of a Muslim mosque full of Muslims performing an obligatory prayer, together with the news of the dead coming back to life. The subtext of the new version of Dawn of the Dead is that Christianity is normality, and if one does not follow Christianity, then an apocalypse will come, with the dead coming back to life.With all the racial and religious tension today in the US, we don't need another reason to make minority groups offended. It is sad that although explicit racism and religionism is prohibited, films like these carryout racism and religionism in its subtext, and gets away with it.",Dawn of the Dead

621,paparowe,Another Unsubstantial Remake,3,22 March 2004,"There is no conceivable reasoning for this being a remake of the original, other  than it has zombies and a mall. Any social commentary made by the original has been lost here. Unlike the original, there is absolutely no cause for using  the mall as  setting. A coffee shop would have sufficed, as that's where they  hang out all day anyway. All focus has been placed upon the action, which is barely adequate. The camera is glued to the actors, so it becomes difficult to  locate yourself in these moments of excitement. The effect is a lot of people  running around, explosions, and gunshots. The claustrophobic camera destroys any tension. It would have been better to put the actors in long shots to create a  vulnerability to them. Needless to say, you can not be scared of what might be  around the corner when you never get to see the corner. With such focus on the  actors, one might expect some good characterization. Forget about that. These  are cardboard cutouts; each allotted about 10 seconds of personal dialogue. You have the tough cop, the gangster, the medic, the innocent girl, the cynicist,  etc. It was a relief in one scene as the survivors talk over dinner. What could  have been an excellent characterization device, is interrupted a few moments later by a power failure. Strangely, one of the more interesting characters is  Andy; another survivor who hangs out on the roof of his shop across the street.  Even the mall survivors seem more interested in him than each other, watching  him through binoculars.All things considered, this is not ""Dawn of the Dead"". It shares more in common  with the gore-inspired Italian Horror genre than the original. Perhaps it could  have been called  ""28 Days Later: Another City"". ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) makes for a basic gore film with a few exciting moments of action. It is good for a  mindless viewing, but don't expect a revolution. If you want zombies in a mall, I  suggest the Hong Kong film, ""Bio-Zombie."" The zombies are a little goofy, but  the great characters and inspired camera-work make this an undeniable classic.",Dawn of the Dead

Plus it takes away your comfort zone, in that, you can't think to yourself, `I would just run away from them.' because those mo-fos' are fast! Great acting, great characters,realistic gore, unbelievable suspense and I don't know what I would have done without the comic relief.  Another thing I liked was they weren't afraid to show you some guts. I mean, they weren't wusses about it. They didn't cut away from the really nasty stuff. This was one of those movies where the entire audience jumps, laughs and says, `What are you doing? Don't kiss her!! She's gunna bite you!!' all in unison. Oh and let's not forget that one girl sitting behind you, who screams her head off every time something happens. This one gets an easy 10 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
623,christopherbrown,Well done remake inspires revisit of original.,8,30 March 2004,"It has been years since I have seen the original, but this remake has inspired me to see it again.  Considering the subject matter, the dialogue holds up well under the strain of the fantastic circumstances the characters are experiencing.  The pacing is is excellent and the comic tension breakers are superb in parts.  The small crowd in the Brooklyn theater was in tune with the irony and for such a small crowd there was lots of laughing out loud.The most horrifying part of the movie for me was brought home by an accident that occurs between the survivors and isn't attributable to the undead.The biggest flaw was the uneven editing in the action sequences near the end of the movie (prior to the shots during the credits which one should watch until the end, btw).  The action gets choppy and it didn't feel stylistic.  There seemed to be some imitation of 28 Days Later style, but the editing to which I refer is more along the lines of our intrepid survivors being in one building and then materiallizing somewhere else.  Just seemed too much of a gap to be intentional.Long story short, go see the movie and suspend that disbelief.  You'll have fun.",Dawn of the Dead

As i saw this movie by total chance during a long December night i thought ahhh give it a try, it can't be worse than i think... but it was.. the first thing to see is a total broke of the rules of the game... (understand the code of classical horror movies... the movie count a lot of characters.. the are no suspense... no mind game... and the living deads runs as fast as hell lol... but again i thought that if that well made why not trying a new way of horror ? but it simply wasn't !

626,adsti3,Awesome! But not too faithful to the original.,10,16 March 2004,"This tremendously entertaining picture strikes a great balance between scares, apocalyptic bleakness, and violent action.  The bravura opening sequence of utter chaos leads into a more subdued, but intermittently intensely violent and gruesome narrative.  The movie never sells itself out to sappiness while retaining some of the original's macabre sense of humor, especially in the ""Burt Reynolds"" scene.  The leads are strong, if not deeply developed; things are happening too quickly to delve deeper into these character's backgrounds, but we still care about them, because each of them, down to the gun-shop owner, possesses a humanity and individuality that sets them apart from the brain-thirsty hordes.Elements of the original are retained, from the secure ennui of the mall to the final journey into the unknown, but this is really its own movie, with the intensity ratcheted up to satisfy audiences used to the rapid-fire thrills of a video game.  The editing and camerawork are reminiscent of _Seven_ and _28 Days Later_, but fit the subject matter perfectly.  An exceptional genre picture.",Dawn of the Dead
627,bytorloveslerxst,OK remake of 28 Days,3,8 May 2004,"Let's start out by stating the obvious.  This is a remake in name only of Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"".  Everything good about the original has been removed: the atmosphere, characters you actually root for, the social commentary, the innovative special effects, etc.  Instead they pretty much re-made 28 days with the exception of people coming back to life and biting people (we never see them really eating anyone).  This is pretty much an MTV generation horror film. We get no character development (aside from a security guard who is an incredible prick at the beginning turning into a saint by the end), no suspense beyond the standard horror movie shocks, and DV camera quality action sequences.  I realize this style freaks some people out but it does nothing for me.  I didn't like it in 28 days either.  So, if you liked 28 days then you'll really enjoy this because this is entertaining at times as long as you don't compare it to any Romero film.  If you're a Romero fan I would only recommend this as a curiosity film.  It is not a remake and it's not in the same league as the original.",Dawn of the Dead

Out side of the mall and zombies, how is this a Romero screenplay? This movie is so bad, I don't even know where to start. Who is Fly Boy in this? The mixed race junk, what does that have to do with Dawn Of The Dead? The white girl who is caring the mixed unborn kid, she turns into a zombie right? When did she ever get infected? You never see that or hear about it in the movie. Since when do zombies run like the wind? I know they were wanting to get them moving more freely in this but give me a break. The best zombie acting is in the classic Night Of The Living Dead. They don't move all that slow and they don't run. When a zombie bites someone they slow die and change into a zombie. There bodies get stiff before they die. If you want to watch a great zombie film, watch any Romeroo zombie film not this junk.",Dawn of the Dead

These zombies have I.Q and good physical strength.After that the starting song goes on and all you see are some military troops getting killed, some black guy saying that he doesn't know what caused it. Then throughout the movie they hide in a mall having sex, having a party, then when Andy the guy next door dies they decide to make a break for it.They make an armoured car with chainsaws, and other weapons such as shotguns, and rifles then when they drive out about 4-5 of the 10 die 3 already died in the mall because they got shot.They run to the docks board a ship go to some random place some girl who was never seen on the movie takes off her bikini then they crash into a weird island and go off then you can see a hundred zombies run to them.Overall HOW THE HELL DID THE ZOMBIES GO ON THE ISLAND THEY CAN'T SWIM?

632,henriennui,Instant classic,9,22 March 2004,"I was not immediately thrilled at the concept of a DotD remake.  The original seemed pretty much complete in itself, and remakes are lame.Then I noticed Sarah Polley in it.  Now, for a talented actress, she has been in almost nothing south of the border since The Sweet Hereafter, and routinely turns down roles.  She simply doesn't do bad movies, and didn't here.  I found that intriguing enough to realize this was probably not a standard remake, and I bet right.And it lived up to its billing.  This movie hits the ground running and doesn't stop.  The first five minutes is perfectly paced and hits with sledgehammer force.  I knew I was in good hands when Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" played over the opening credits.  Incidentally, I thought the opening and closing credits were comparable to another favorite set of credits, the ones in Se7en.There were only a couple direct homages to the original Romero film, one of them a setup for the shot from the poster of the original DotD movie.  I won't spoil this by naming the actor, but I think you'll see it coming. It's an intriguing twist on that moment.I won't comment on the obvious differences in the original, or the post-ironic conceit of zombies in a shopping mall in 2004.  (Zombies in a shopping mall!  Just like real life!)My gripes are very minor, and involve somewhat overdoing a few camera techniques that were also overdone in 28 Days Later.  However, one area where the film excelled was in pacing.  The violence was perfectly choreographed.  (Also, I want to marry Sarah Polley, but I'll save that subject for somewhere else.)I have seen reviews complaining of shallowness or repetitiveness, but I think such comments completely miss the point of a zombie movie, which is the existential horror of lurching sameness, and the complete lack of any moral complexity.  Zombies are simply insensate evil, and must be destroyed. The carnage does not involve human beings, nor villains, simply nonliving evil that must be destroyed.  Unlike the humans killed in a Dirty Harry movie or a war movie, zombies have no intrinsic value whatsoever.  There are no shades of gray, and no guilt in enjoying the slaughter.As such, the only way to judge a film is how it hits you in the stomach. This film had me cringing back in my seat from the first few minutes, and never let up.  I have to commend the opening, and how, like the zombies themselves, it moved fast, with a wonderful lack of stupid expository comments, explanations, or meaning.  Without hesitation, it simply jumps headfirst into the gaping maw of horror.In short, it is completely without any redeeming social value.And that is how it should be.This is an instant classic, and the crystallization of all zombie movies to date.",Dawn of the Dead
633,henriennui,Instant classic,9,30 March 2004,"I just got back from this.It absolutely rocked.  I think it is the best zombie movie of all time, including the original Dawn of the Dead, although the pace was closer to Cameron than Romero.I was leery of the general idea of a remake of the Romero classic, until I noticed Sarah Polley was in it.  She simply doesn't do bad movies, so her presence promised something more than just a derivative schlockfest.
It masterfully combines the rollercoaster Hollywood film with the sheer creepiness of the original.  It also has enough of the light touch of the original to offset the horror enough to be just barely tolerable.Additionally, the zombie makeup manages to be campy and silly and terrifying at the same time.  This is a good trick.This kind of movie has to be judged with the gut, and I found myself cringing in my seat more than once.  It had a lot of similarities to 28 Days Later, but was just plain better, without the pacing problems of the last half of 28 Days.The first ten minutes are superbly paced, and the situation develops with a near total lack of the stupid exposition or explanation that usually interrupts the carnage long enough to be annoying in a disaster movie. The total collapse of society is so quick that it mercifully leaves little time for stupid talking heads.  The movie dives headfirst into the absolute horror of the situation without sentimentality.This also has the best opening credits I have seen since Se7en, with ""When the Man Comes Around"" by Johnny Cash setting the tone for the rest of the movie.The movie is packed with scenes so rattling that the rare calm scene where little is happening is completely nerve-racking.  I still have an adrenaline rush.Anyway, if you like zombie movies, this is, in my opinion, the ultimate one.  I liked the original, but this one takes the original and kicks its ass.  My only (slight) gripe is the overuse near the end of faux-clumsy handheld-style tracking shots, but I can live with it.  The scenes in question are still paced perfectly.  I also don't have any better idea for how they could have done it.  Obviously vanilla smooth Steadicam or dolly shots would have been completely out of the question.The best single performance in the film is Matt (Max Headroom) Frewer's, as a doomed zombie bite victim.  This scene includes one of the few direct Romero allusions, specifically the shot used on the most commonly seen poster for the 1978 classic.Another great thing about this film is it is the perfect film to knock Mel Gibson out of the #1 spot.",Dawn of the Dead

Not knowing what to expect, she tries her best to keep him alive. But too late, her husband was infected. He became a part of ""them"". Pratically a zombie, trying to eat humans alive! Ana panicked, and went to the bathroom to hide herself from being hurt. She tried to calm herself from what just happened. Her own husband trying to attack! Being as calm and collected as she can...went and open the door-BAM! Luis's head pops up! He twist and turned...trying to get a taste of his once called wife. Ana, on the other hand, was shocked! Her heart racing, and pounding to get outside. She ran for her car...and saw something horrifying. All hell break lose; her neighbors were all infected...

In my view, it's the best zombie movie ever made.The actors are likable, which makes you empathetic to their cause. You want them to succeed, you feel sorrow when things go bad. My main complaint with so many other zombie movies is I couldn't care less about the actors. Also, in Dawn of the Dead, the quality of acting is good, much better than most other films of it's type.The film has plenty of action, but it doesn't detract from being a horror film. There's plenty of gore and quite frankly, the zombies scare the bejesus out of me (and I don't scare easily). I think one think I particularly like about this film is that the zombies are really nasty, fast, aggressive, in-your-face intimidating monsters who would really scare you in real life. I've just never been that keen with slow moving, sinister, but gormless, zombies. The zombies in Dawn of the Dead are truly terrifying.The pace of the film is excellent too. It moves quickly from scene to scene but at a good pace and covers many different things which keeps the film as a whole interesting.I really can't recommend this film enough.

638,skingfan,Finally a truly enjoyable horror movie!!,10,28 March 2004,"In 1968, a young director by the name of George Romero filmed an inexpensive horror movie that would later be hailed by movie critics the world round as a cult classic (and for good reason!) That movie was, of course, the black-and-white zombie flick, Night of the Living Dead.  I have seen the remake and it was truly enjoyable.  Now, as a rule, I tend to find re-makes unneccessary for the most part; the original films are usually classics and a re-make often lacks the same texture and feeling that the original had. There are very few exceptions, of course, and Dawn of the Dead is one of them.  First of all, let's face the facts about horror movies: most of the ones that have come out in the last year or two have, quite frankly, been nothing short of horrible, i.e. They, 13 Ghosts, The House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Wrong Turn, Cabin Fever and let's not forget the god-awful, pathetic excuse for a horror movie, Darkness Falls (if you haven't seen it yet, PLEASE spare yourself the misery and skip it...trust me, you're NOT missing anything...and if you have seen it, my deepest condolences for the time wasted watching it). There have also been some really good ones, most notably The Ring and Freddy Vs Jason (admittedly, it's really more of just a guilty pleasure for us NOES and FT13th fans)...I haven't seen the remake of Texas Chainsaw Masacre, but I've heard it's good so I'll rent it this Tuesday.  But I'm straying from the point here. Dawn of the Dead starts off right away with a sense that things are about to go wrong, or already have. The pace is very even, very fluid and certainly doesn't leave you waiting for the movie to get to the point.  It's effectively creepy, gory and scary as hell in all the right places and ways: what if you literally woke up one morning and discovered that the world you knew so well was changed forever? That the people you know and love are not only dead, but also part of the teeming thousands of walking, flesh-eating zombies on the hunt for blood? You actually care about the characters in here and fear that one of them will get left behind only to become lunch for the hungry dead.  **Possible Spoiler** Another thing I liked was the ending: unlike the low-key 28 Days Later, this movie's ending is much creepier, and without the happy-go-lucky ""everything turned out okay and they lived happily ever after"" kind of ending that 28 Days Later tried to offer us.  Plus, the zombies in here are really creepy, thanks to George Romero's famous touch.  Trust me, this one's worth seeing!!",Dawn of the Dead
639,morbidasperge-1,Misleading title but still a good horror movie.,4,1 April 2005,"When I came across this title I said to myself OK, Romero's Dawn Of The Dead is one of the best horror movies ever, why did someone felt the need to film a remake of it? Then I saw the preview and understood one thing, it was a different movie. The only things the two have in common is that people are hiding in a mall and there are flesh eating undead creatures.Notice I don't, and can't, use the word zombie because it's a known fact that zombies are slow creatures. Zombies who can run DON'T EXIST.This being clarified, and the initial deception being left aside. DOTD2K4 is a good horror movie, in the sense that there is no comforting mood. At no point, past the helicopter scene, one can think of of an happy ending. And that's just perfect.The good surprises come from the Director's cut DVD extras, On the news bulletin, we get to see a cleaning team in Monroeville PA, for those who didn't know, the original Dawn of the dead was shot in the Monroeville mall. There is also Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger from the original movie playing small roles. Ken as a televangelist repeats the same tag-line he gave us in the first movie : ""When there's no more room in hell..."" I give this movie a 4 not because it's that bad, but zombies don't run and I won't allow a director to play god with Satan's creatures.",Dawn of the Dead
640,EddyC09,A Great Remake?,6,26 August 2009,"Dawn of The Dead 2004Director:Zack SnyderStarring:Sarah Polley,Ving Rhames,Jake WeberThe original dawn of the Dead will always be the definite zombie movie and nothing will ever beat it but the remake is still pretty darn good. Instead of wasting all the time developing characters this movie is wall to wall action.which is no bad thing because the movie is perfectly paced and has a different feel than the original. You probably wont be learning the characters names but you will still get the jist of whats going on.One complaint i have is that i just didn't like the feel of the mall maybe because it wasn't explored but the originals mall just cant be beat. The Movie is more a re-imagining taking the basic survivors stuck in a mall idea and the similarities stop there. The story wont do anything for most but the pace and action will make up for it,while the acting is all pretty good apart from the red haired girl who loses her father,her performance was laughable.all in all a really enjoyable action flick!!!!3/5",Dawn of the Dead
641,hac-ivy,"hands down, THE best zombie movie ever.",10,7 January 2010,"early george a. romero's gore-tastic films have a tendency to be, well, a bit humorous. the original dawn of the dead, don't get me wrong i love the film and it's a classic, however, it lacks the potent surprise of the undead and limits the potential of zombies. i'd say this film is the sequel Aliens to Alien. a bia-jillion times better. the originals are still good, but don't hold a candle to the next! this movie has every element of everything you've ever wanted from a zombie film. thoroughly entertaining and these are the best flesh eating undead zombies to date! incredibly scary and lightning fast. sit back and enjoy this action packed blood lusty zombie instant classic! 10 out of 10. if you ever watch one zombie film, this is it.",Dawn of the Dead
642,kev-coyne,One of the best ever remakes?,9,26 March 2004,"This has to be one of the best films ever made in the horror/ action horror genre. I was a big fan of the original George A Romero film, and went into the cinema with a cynical eye. But after ten minutes of the film I was totally won over. The first ten minutes of the film are hard hitting, and brilliantly directed. I thought the film would probably go down hill after such a great start, but the adrenalin just kept rising. There were parts of the film that made you want to cheer out loud.The screenplay and direction paid homage to the original film, but slickly mixed the 'old school' zombie film style with modern action and camera techniques. I was concerned that the makers may have made a completely different slasher style movie under the franchise of Dawn Of The Dead, but have indeed made a faithful remake, which stays very true to the original story.The casting in this film is superb. The actors have a good balance of not taking themselves too seriously, but being quite believable at the same time. CJ is probably the coolest warrior ever to appear in a zombie film!The makers have injected a small amount of humour into the film, which is more ironic than cheesy, which create some original funny moments. The makers have been very innovative, and have added some new ideas seamlessly into the action and story, making it fresh and interesting.It is refreshing to see organic gore effects, as many films now depend on computer imagery. The gore is nicely sick and bloody, but here comes my only criticism; there could have been more shots of zombies devouring human flesh and organs!If you like action horror, this film will blow you away. The rollercoaster doesn't stop until you find out what film they used to shoot it with! 9/10",Dawn of the Dead
643,PlatypusesRus,One of the best zombie movies ever...(minor spoilers),9,25 March 2011,"I love zombie movies. I'm a big horror/scary movie fan and, as a rule, prefer suspenseful and creepy to gory and bloody, but zombie movies just blow me away for some reason. Ever since the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD which gave me nightmares as a kid, I just can't get enough of the genre.This is by far one of the best I've ever seen. The mixture of creepiness, spine-tingling ""gotcha"" moments, and prevalent humor is absolutely perfect. Even the typical asshole-redeems-himself-in-the-end is done in a fresh and believable way. His transformation is gradual so we buy it completely as true.The characters are truly fleshed out, and you get to know them all and care about them, which makes you kind of fight right along side them.I think one of the most disturbing parts to me is near the end before they leave the mall. Up till now, all through most of the movie, the cop and the gun-shop owner across the street have been communicating from their respective rooftops via binoculars and dry-wipe boards. First they play a game where the cop writes to the gun shop guy, ""Do Burt Reynolds..."" and you look down in the crowd of zombies lurching about the street and, sure enough, there's a zombie who's the spitting image of Burt. BLAM, the gun shop guy blows him away.Later, the group at the mall prepare a couple of large vehicles to be as defensible as possible so they can smash their way through the zombies and possibly find safety somewhere. They intend to go by the gun shop first and rescue the owner. But, something happens and he is bitten. The cop radios him through a walkie talkie he managed to get over to him to ask if he's okay. You see it coming. You know it's coming. You KNOW it. But, when the cop sees the gun guy climb up to the roof and begin writing on the dry wipe board, and the cop puts the binoculars to his eyes, well...it still breaks my heart to see it and it still makes the little hairs on my arms stand on end.Great screenplay, great acting, fantastic cinematography, impeccable directing. Probably the most entertaining couple of hours you'll have watching a scary movie.",Dawn of the Dead
644,skazz,29 Days Later?,1,20 March 2004,"Someone pointed out to me that 28 Days Later was not persay a zombie film... and true as that may be, my contention is that Zack Snyder's (who) Dawn redux is no more a zombie film than 28 Days. It is poorly scripted (by Scooby Doo's James Gunn, so what did we expect?) and more closely resembles a sequel to 28 Days Later than a reworking of the classic film it is intended be based on. Sure this one also takes place in a mall, and has cameos from 3 actors from the original, but where the Texas Chainsaw redux created an intriguing, suspenseful and original take on the 1974 film, it also captured the essence of Tobe Hooper's classic. Dawn 2004 captures none of that. This film supposes that none of us have seen NOTLD or DOTD(1978) and tries to pull us in with a dizzying 10 minute prologue, which is taught and well constructed but ultimately leads us to... well NOTHING!!! A bunch of people you don't care about talking, talking and talking some more and for good measure they kill a couple of ""zombies"" so we don't forget what the movie is supposed to be about. Some stupid comic relief for those who can't handle the ""horror"" (if you can call it that) and then the breakneck final act which is edited in that MTV,  shaky cam (Blair Witch), cut every nanosecond pace in which the ""zombie"" attacks in 28 days were edited or for that matter any typical ""Fast and the Furious"" action film of the past decade which is geared to appease the no-attention-span video game playing fans who make this kind of crap so successful at the box office. There were NO scares in this movie, every moment was predictable and formulaic. The attempt at character development via the silly and overlong conversations that took place around the coffee shop only served to bog down the film and I for one nearly left the theater 45 minutes in. Not a memorable performance among the leads. The best moments came from Tom Savini and Ken Foree in brief cameos. Ving Rhames even disappoints and one can only hope that Jack Lemmon hung on to that Oscar that Ving gave him. The film had some (too few to mention) moments, but then so do reruns of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" With the recent releases of films like Wrong Turn, Cabin Fever and the TCM redux I was beginning to think there was hope for the horror genre, but after seeing DOTD 2004, I say let the dead STAY dead for now and cross my fingers that George A. can get his 4th dead film made. Any TRUE zombie fan who LIKED this movie needs a lobotomy. When there's no more room in hell... the dead will continue walking right past this waste of time!",Dawn of the Dead
645,Echo12b,One of the Greats,10,19 March 2004,"This remake is probably the best remake of all time.  The director captured everything that Romero put into the original, and added some more.  The character's are realistic, unlike those in some horror movies, and the special effects are captivating.  The comic relief bits are funny, and give you a sense of security, when you already know there is none.  But we definitely have to thank the movie ""28 days later.""  If not for that excellent film, ""Dawn of the Dead"" would not have been anywhere near as exciting as it was.  I know most of you are true fans of George Romero, as I am one myself, but this movie does not knock his name from the top; it raises it higher.  I don't know about anyone else, but I give this movie a BIG 10, and will be back in the theaters very soon!!!",Dawn of the Dead
646,dtrcartwright,"It's a zombie film, it credits Romero's Screenplay and it's called Dawn of the Dead; but somehow it doesn't feel like it belongs in the ""Dead"" series",8,27 March 2004,"Have just seen the ""re-envisioning"" of Dawn of the Dead and overall really enjoyed this film (certainly more so than I would have expected).  The directing and shutter speed was very much in your face - this is indeed undead for the MTV generation.Phantom Menace was dubbed Star Wars Episode 1.  It sounded and looked like a Star Wars movie but after watching it the first time - you kind of didn't feel like you had just watched a Star Wars film.  This movie leaves you feeling the same way - it is a zombie film, it credits Romero's Screenplay and it is called Dawn of the Dead; but somehow it doesn't feel like it belongs in the ""Dead"" series.  For me - they could have given this one a completely non-related title and it would have stood on its own merits. Not being titled Dawn of the Dead would actually have removed much of the baggage that comes with reworking such a well-loved classic.SPOILERS> The opening sequence where Ana leaves her house and surveys the carnage taking place on her doorstep whilst helicopters buzz overhead was tremendous.  The aerial photography that follows as Ana takes a car journey to safety was breathtaking.  Awesome.  To be fair, as the opening credits roll - those scenes set a standard which the film struggles to maintain thereafter.Whilst the Mall in the original DOTD was brightly lit by fluorescent light this new film delivers a claustrophobic, spot lit location which ensures many shocks and never actually portrays the mall as a safe haven. Watching this film is a truly gruelling experience - I felt physically exhausted as I left the Cinema.In the original DOTD there is sufficient character development to ensure that we feel sympathy for the characters, we understand them and believe in them.  With the exception of Ana, Michael and Kenneth there is no characterisation in this new movie.  You never get to know the characters and writing these comments I am struggling to remember the names of the supporting cast.The plot suffered from many moments that just did not make sense: 1. How come Nicole drives the truck over to Andy's to fetch the dog? Couldn't they just whistle to recall the dog?  If you could get a truck over there then why didn't they save Andy earlier? 2. Why does everyone go through the sewers to rescue Nicole from Andy's shop? If you could get over there by sewer then why didn't they save Andy earlier?  Why bother messing about in sewers anyway when you have two reinforced buses in your garage? 3. Why does CJ hang around on the last bus instead of escaping?  This is purely a plot device to enable him to die an heroic death and redeem himself for earlier actions when he subjugated the other survivors. 4. Why did the bloated fat woman become athletic once undead?  Why does being undead bestow such high levels of physical fitness?  (Fitness that was not there whilst the person was in life)?I really struggle with this last point and whilst I welcome the zombie movie mini-revival which is taking place - I have to say that I am a bit of a purist and prefer the undead to shuffle along.  All of this running around is clearly inspired by ""28 Days Later"" - but let's be clear - the creatures in ""28 Days Later"" are NOT zombies or undead, they are plague victims.This sounds like I am moaning.  I am not.  DOTD (2004) is a great film - an 8 out of 10 for me and I eagerly anticipate the DVD release.It is well reported elsewhere but if you watch all of the end credits then the fate of the survivors is revealed; you won't miss this closing footage because a thoughtfully used ""tit shot"" ensures that the credits keep your attention!  (It works for me)!References to other movies I noticed included: PSYCHO - Ana falling in her bath and pulling the shower curtain down whilst covered in blood. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD - Ana's car rolls down a hill and strikes a tree. 28 DAYS LATER - Substitute mall security guards for British Army troops ruling over the survivors; the virus based contagion and the athletic zombies sprinting to catch their prey. DAWN OF THE DEAD - Protagonists holed up in a shopping mall whilst the undead roam outside. ALIEN - although the filmmakers shied away from actually having an undead baby burst from the unfortunate Luda's body. TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - the scenes where Zombies are despatched from the outside of the bus and the horrifying scene where the blonde (don't remember her name) is sliced through - Tobe Hooper would have loved that scene in his movie! ZOMBIE FLESH-EATERS (ZOMBI 2) - Zombies occupying a remote island accessible by yacht. SE7EN - the head in the box.",Dawn of the Dead
647,Stanley_L_Walker,Fast! Gory! SCARY! What more could you want in a Zombie movie?,10,29 March 2004,"There are moments in this film where you WILL lurch, gasp, shudder, and, depending on your stomach, vomit.  I was very impressed with this remake. It does not strive to regurgitate the original.  Instead what we get is a fresh and dynamic take on the original film.  In the very basic sense, the plot structure is the same:  people seek shelter from cannibalistic horror in a shopping mall.However, the visual style, the acting, the characters, and the details are all different.  Whereas the original was more socially conscious, this remake seeks only to frighten and entertain.If you enjoy being scared and you enjoy that intense kind of anticipation and adrenalin rush, go see it.  But bring your barf bags!",Dawn of the Dead
648,SunnyMars,Great!,9,15 April 2004,"I had great expectations - and I was not disappointed!More than just another remake of a classic picture. Very good special effects and a brilliant makeup makes the horror real. New ideas (the running zombies are now a real danger for all of our heroes) and a ""new"" plot with new characters! A very thrilling picture with black humor and bloody gore elements... I love it!!! My conclusion: Some people say, that you can´t call it a real remake of die original ""Dawn..."", because there are too much differences between the plots. But if there would be too much accordances, most of the people would say: ""No new ideas! Why did they realize this movie? ... waste!""

THE END!,8,20 March 2004,"i really liked this movie. i love horror movies, but zombie movies are the ones that scare me the most since dead people should stay dead! i haven't seen any good horror movies lately, so this is awesome. i like the fact that they go straight to the point: like, less than 10 minutes into the movie, hell breaks loose! and i also like the fact that they continue showing scenes during the credits since i hate it when we don't get to see the ending-ending in a lot of movies. the only things is, it didn't seem that believable: the whole running super speed/strength zombies. but it did make the movie freakier. there is one scene that i can't stop thinking about and it's the one with the dog and the sandwich going to andy, i was freaked since i'm a big dog fan. well, all i have to say is that you should watch it since i'm sure there won't be a really good horror movie coming out anytime soon!",Dawn of the Dead
650,apecat,Better than I guessed it would be,7,15 April 2006,"I am writing this as a fan of artsy fartsy visual storytelling rather than one who loves gory graphical horror, or the zombie theme as a whole. I can't say i disliked DOD '04, although I don't think it is as masterful as the original. Keep in mind that DOD and DOD '04 are hard to compare since they definitely differ a lot in style and audiovisual expression as well as plot-wise. Perhaps Romero would have liked the possibilities new technology in film-making has brought with it, but the '78'er's the big advantage over 04 is the fact that horror easily gets a bit pathetic and not scary. A zombie model '04 is a remarkably scarier creature than its cousin of 1978; it moves as fast, or even faster than a living human and is a goal-oriented killing/eating machine. Thus one of the main points in the original movie is lost. The inefficient, slow ex-consumer stuck in a circle of reliving old habits and instincts in the mall of the '78 version is long gone, while horror movie clichés are planted everywhere. There is, however a very good take on the consumerism of today still left, revised but intact, and that sort of saves this new version from being gory rubbish, at least seen from an artistic and social commentary oriented point of view.The very important words Us & Them and the them still have their meaning here, but sadly, in a way, the threat of other human beings in the ""chaotic end of the world zombie takeover""-sort of situation is in a way replaced by raging zombies that are pure monsters rather than stupid corpses suffering from hyperactivity The acting is, I think, more professional, even if not always much convincing here in Zack Snyder's version. I can, however say that I liked the urban, cynical, rich, modern, pathetic asshole (""Steve"") played by Ty Burrell. Visually its prettier and creepier and more dramatic but also introduces the risk of too much action, which there definitely is. Together with the industrial heavy metal inspired soundtrack the taste of splashy, mediocre horror is present, luckily combined with an interesting picture of life in the early 00's. It's also sad that the sound mix didn't have what it takes to boost horror.Through the movie we get the chance to compare dignified deaths, stupid deaths and the messy deaths of fighters, but the outcome is always the same in a meaningless way that very well concludes the whole mood of the film, where the viewer can observe the danger of the most loved but always lying part of the human imagination: Hope.",Dawn of the Dead

This was an exception because a certain magazine gave it an A and my local newspaper gave it a B. So maybe my mistake was having too high hopes for this one.According to the reviews, it was witty. Really, it was? Because I must have totally missed the witty part. Even that sarcastic guy who shows up was disappointing. I was expecting humorous comments. Didn't get 'em. The funniest part to me was when Ana was driving away and we get a bird's eye view of the town after the outbreak, and this car comes full speed, misses her Toyota by a few feet and slams into the gas station. It's not like I was looking for 'Frasier' quality intelligence here.It was also supposed to be scary. Nope. I jumped a couple of times, but that's really it. Gory movies are often mistaken for scary ones.The acting was... sub par at best. Where was the character development? Ving Rhames is always angry. Sarcastic guy is always... cynical.

Really intense. Intense intense intense... the pacing of the action beautifully creates the feeling that everyone is just hanging on for their lives, and breaks are few and far between. About mid-way through the action slacks for about 10 minutes, and I felt myself welcoming the mental break almost as much as the characters themselves.
This is a fun movie... make sure to see it with a group of friends, and don't get up to go to the restroom. And unlike most other zombie movies, the zombies are actually pretty scary... I've heard a few complain about the idea of a fast zombie, but the slow, shambling zombies of resident evil look absolutely lame in comparison to these fast, screaming unfortunates.

I decided to see this movie after seeing the first ten minutes previewed on channel 4.  It had me hooked and wanting to see more, as all movies should.  A very engaging and well done start.However, the rest of the movie, as i have found with many horror movies was a bit of a let down.  They seem to be full of wonderful thrilling moments that capture what seeing a movie in a cinema is all about.  Don't get me wrong it is a very good film, filling all of what is expected of a horror genre movie.  Am i wrong to want more from the genre?  I am beginning to think so after watching such recent horror movie's.Just as forgettable as it is fun.

658,Aled_the_Dog,"Worth Seeing, even as a fan of the Original.",8,31 March 2004,"Ok then, as an avid fan of the original i was sceptical about this new version, whether it could live up to the hype or not.However, i was very glad to say that i really enjoyed the film. The characters in the film are a nice mix of stereotypes - who complement each other very well while doing well not to annoy the audience. And it's good to see a bucnch of people in a horror film that actually use a bit of common sense for a change.The zombies in the film are great aswell, they are still primitive but from the trailer you can see how agile they are compared to their 1978 counterparts which of course give them an extra edge that the humans have to deal with. Hats off to the Special FX and make up in the film, they do a great job, the zombies look exactly what you would expect them to be.There is plenty of gore and action in the film but nothing too over the top, which is mixed in with a refreshing slice of humor aswell. The plot allows the film to build momentum, however, i think in the advent of films becoming longer it could've benefitted from an extra 30-40 mins in the middle.For fellow hardcore Romero fans: i'd recommend it - good film, and theres some goodies in there for our benefit too.For everyone else: Go see it, simple as because you'll enjoy it.My vote: 8/10",Dawn of the Dead
659,ejc15,A more than worthy remake of the best movie of all time,10,28 January 2005,"Some are bothered that there would be an attempt at a remake of such a classic as the original Dawn of the Dead. This is not a typical remake but as the director said it is a re-imagining. I loved the first movie and loved this movie. I absolutely refuse to compare the two as each has its own qualities and inspirations. I can only say I left the theater with an ache in my neck from the tension.The opening of the movie, as many have said, is as scary as any movie ever made. Although I would have liked to have seen more of societies break down, the opening credits did a wonderful job of a quick summary of the fall of civilization.The pure terror and shock that Ana must have felt was superbly displayed in the opening scene. Watching the DVD over and over, I can find different attacks and reaction by several neighbors. The whole scene does a fabulous job of showing absolute kaos descending upon suburbia.There may have been some disposable characters, and sometimes the characters did not behave in ways in which we think we would have acted. But how many times do large groups of people, under great stress always do the right thing. Overall, absent the unreality of the movie, I thought it portrayed the people in a very real way. Excellent acting, story, camera work and worthy of being a re-imagining of the best movie of all time.The DVD also explains many plot holes that may have been found in an initial theatrical viewing, either via Andy's tape, the news reports or deleted scenes.Finally do not turn the movie off before the closing credits end. This is one of the few movies to watch from the opening frame until the last credit is over.",Dawn of the Dead
660,deluge69-1,B Action/Horror thriller delivers . . .,10,12 November 2004,"Yes, I was at first pretty skeptical of this remake to Romero's memorable class-sick. WHY??? It's not like it was an older B&W B film, although I always preferred the original NOTLD in B&W for the grim mood it conveyed.Anyways, a friend convinced me to watch this 'remake' on DVD. I'm now very glad he talked me into it. The opening was smashing, and had me immediately engaged - not a single wasted second, thanks to good camera-work and tight editing. The sense of tension really grows as it appears that most of the world is now under siege from the killer-zombies. There is a strong, building momentum to the pacing and escalating menace which the characters now find themselves cast adrift in.The zombies move at a very fast pace in this version, giving it a riveting action edge. Comparing both the original and this remake is an 'apples & oranges' thing to me. Both stand on their separate merits, and actually compliment each other. Like showing two different perspectives of the zombie invasion from two different towns, and the similar gut reactions of both groups of desperate characters. Yay, I know, how does that explain why they are swift in one area and near-crippled in another??!! I'll consider any sound suggestions.For a taut entertaining horror/thriller this does deliver and it held my suspenseful interest til the end. The lead woman was the best character, followed by Ving Rhames who is solid and believable. I cared about the fates of everyone, and that is always a good sign, or, in this case, a bad sign. The sense of dread is prevalent throughout.One problem I had was that no one ever asks what is happening, what caused this; etc. They just accept it like recurring characters on a TV series. If you were suddenly caught up in this bloody nightmare, wouldn't you wonder what has caused this, and what the authorities are doing about it? The news announcers don't ever mention anything either or even express any wonder. Things like this can erode any suspense the film is trying to create.Otherwise, the zombies bear similarities to the infected 'zombie-like' killers in 28 DAYS LATER, but I found this to be a far better film. There are only a few gory moments, but they work within the film's tight structure. You may want to rent it some night when you're in the mood for a good zombie thriller. Just don't expect a great masterpiece.",Dawn of the Dead
661,xcisics,Higher classed in the low class genre of zombie movies!,8,19 September 2014,"Whenever I begin watching a modern movie with the slightest hint of zombies in it, my expectations are never high, and this was completely true for Dawn of the Dead. So, when I sat down to begin watching, I was expecting a movie more to the likes of the horrendous Night of the Living Dead 3D; definitely not up to the standard of a George Romero classic. However, Zack Snyder impressed and surprised me with this movie.The plot was obviously moderately based on the Romero take of the movie, with an all new set of characters. Combined with the modern CGI and effects we have today, this 2004 was a close competitor to the highly set bar by the OG of zombie movies.I loved the way the characters use ingenious methods of zombie aversion, and Snyder's modern take on the original shuffling zombie is a fresh take on this classical genre. Despite this, some of these zombie slaughtering ideas by the group seemed almost too comical for a movie without the comedy tag. Overall, Snyder's Dawn of the Dead is a great movie, with a revitalized take on the Romero benchmark. While it may not be equal to it's predecessor, this movie is a great, edge of your seat watch that I would recommend for any zombie lover.",Dawn of the Dead
662,smartfash,"Good action movie, with Zombies",7,29 August 2004,"When I first heard the 1978 horror classic dawn of the dead would be remade, i felt pretty skeptical, knowing todays horror movie makers tendancies to neglect story and atmosphere in favour of cheap scares(monster jumps out and yells BOO!) and over the top computer generated effects.My first qualm when seeing this movie was 'running zombies', I felt this displayed a level of dexterity which shows them less like creepy 'living dead', and more like living people infected with cannibalistic urges, obviously an attempt to keep in touch with peoples new idea of zombies as seen in 28 days later, and though this leaves less room for tension it does allow for some exciting scenes and some visceral action, the characters arern't too imaginative, most of them we know nothing about(eccept that they will die),and the movies attempts at humor often fall flat because they are dropped in with little subtlety. On the plus side this movie really does look good, the make up and effects are convincing and the story has enough new material to keep you on you interested, though this isn't the thoughtful journey of survival or suspenseful horror that was the original, it is a pretty entertaining action movie which wont make you think, but will make you watch and listen.",Dawn of the Dead
663,Shades747,"Wow, zombies CAN be scary!",9,15 September 2004,"I've always loved horror movies. I REALLY like zombie movies and I know that the zombie survival guide is a must read. I've always wished for an Solanum outbreak in real life, as I was sure I was prepared to deal with them properly. Not any more. This movie makes zombies scary again. Now I'm not so sure I could survive. This is how horror movies are supposed to be, and if you haven't seen it, then you haven't seen enough zombie movies. Plus the ending is perfect.Overall it's a great remake of the original (which is a must-see as well). I was told that some of the original cast was involved, which is certainly cool, although you can enjoy this version on it's own.POSSIBLE SPOILER:Don't stop watching until the credits are over.",Dawn of the Dead
664,frederikos-nikolis,a new horror classic,8,7 October 2004,"Romero's original Dawn of the dead is without question one of the best horror films ever made, as is the Original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". With the re-make of that last film in mind, one could have very easily disregarded the remake of Dawn. But within minutes in Dawn's re-make you know you are in for a much more original film than Texas re-make.Dawn starts with Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"", how is that for an introduction, and what follows is just as good. The story floats around fluently, and just as in the original, much comment is given on today's society. This could easily have become an over-producted-special effects-gore fest, but instead, most scary moments are just brilliant editing and directing,as was the original. The difference between Dawn's re-make and Texas re-make is that both the original films had good story lines,a terrific premise,and were much better production than most horror films. The producers and director of the new Dead, have staid very close to the good elements of the original and have put in some new ingredients. Texas re-make kept only the premise and became, well a film massacre. This new Dawn of the Dead is one of the best horror films of recent years, and should give the director much recognition as was given to Romero after his first Dead film. Scary as hell, well made, good performances, excellent camera and editing makes Dawn of the Dead a must see film.",Dawn of the Dead

666,hothead6400,Now that was fun!,10,27 March 2005,"It seems most comments are coming from horror aficionados who have seen the original. I'm not one of them. I have neither the time nor the inclination to watch a movie more than once... Indeed I rarely watch a movie in its entirety unless it is really compelling. I didn't expect this one would hold my attention longer than a heartbeat. To date, I've seen it three times. It's a fun escape.At 40 I'm at the tail end of the baby boom. A lot of consumer goods and services are targeted at us boomers; it's a big demographic. This includes movies. As I've gotten older, my tastes have changed - mindless gore no longer cuts it. A lot of idealistic, corny, social commentary makes me roll my cynical eyes dismissively. And blaringly, loud, shock scenes are just annoying. Dawn of the Dead 2004 seems to have been made for boomers. The vicarious experience was just right. The non-zombie characters could be my friends or co-workers. The story doesn't stretch reality to the point of being silly; you only have to suspend your belief where necessary (vis-a-vis zombies). At the same time, it doesn't attempt to be too serious either. To put it in some perspective, the Die Hard films don't use a supernatural element, but are they really any more probable?***Potential spoiler ahead*** I enjoy pondering what I would have done differently had I been there. The mall was a good idea though an airport might have been better. I think that Andy would have had a hunting bow and could have shot an arrow trailing a fishing line across to the mall roof. With that they could have passed a rope across allowing weapons, food, and even Andy himself to get over. Anyway, enough said. See the movie.",Dawn of the Dead
667,sillysohail,Brilliant Film to watch :D,8,23 August 2006,"I liked the film, it was interesting that how they made the zombies and props. Most of the film has lot's of gore and violent scenes. This film can make people jump too. You would want to rent first just in case if you don't like it. It's a fresh remake of the original but even better. The stunts were amazing, to be honest it is the best I've seen for a zombie film.Each survivors have different personality, and different way of life but the acting were good.

668,FranBB,Brilliant,10,10 July 2005,"DOTD 2004 is brilliant. We haven't had a noticeable zombie film in some time now, and this more than makes up for it.Its exciting, emotional, its tense. Its also dark but has a sense of humour that surprisingly works well with the rest of the film. I love watching horror/sci-fi, and thought I could stand any level of violence. But this film is particularly violent, and all the better for it. Unlike the original, the zombies can't easily be outrun; they have super strength and pose far more of a threat than the ones in the tame original ever did. Whilst it does share some common elements to the original, it is not an exact remake. This one is far superior. The people act how you would EXPECT them to act (such as the people in the mall) This one also leaves a lot of questions unanswered (just check the message board below to see), and a sequel has been announced.Let's just hope its better than LOTD, which I hear is disappointing.",Dawn of the Dead

I was very happy with zombie films until i saw 28 days later, i know that 28 days later is not a zombie film but just rage infected people, but the fact that these (zombies) could run gave me i new insight to (zombie)films.When i first saw the trailer for Dawn of The dead i was a little worried that this might be just another zombie film (which is good) but then i saw the 10 min start on channel 4 and saw what happened and throuth wow this looks great.I then went to the cinema and well what can i say, but from the VERY start i was hocked and wanted to see more and more is what i saw.Now should you go and see Dawn Of The Dead well if you don't like zombie films but do like blood and guts well this has blood and guts with a lot of zombies in it.So i think that everyone (who is 18 or over) should go and see this film right away and you will know what i mean",Dawn of the Dead

671,wyckeddreamz,This remakes place in the trilogy,8,17 December 2005,"First of all, let me say this.... this is one of the most awesome horror remakes I have seen in a while. Many times you see a ""newer"" version of an old horror classic and it falls well short of the thrill and chills the original gave you. This movie set the scene in the beginning to show you how much we take for granted our everyday lives, and how normal they are, how dependent we are on the rest of society to remain ""normal"" and ordered.Then all hell breaks loose. The action and thrills were on par with the original (which I watched as a child and was on the edge of my seat). This movie did not have Romero's flair, but then again, I guess it wasn't supposed to. My only gripe about this movie at all was that the zombies were fast, not slow. 28 Days later introduced the ""fast"" zombie, but then they weren't zombies, they were just ""infected"".... but i know a zombie when I see one. This movie seems to me like it was trying to recapture the audience that went out to see and liked 28 days later. They did a great job, but I just wished the zombies were bit slower and they had've stuck closer to the main script. What really impressed me about this film the most I;d have to say is in the end, when they took the boat and landed on an island.... Fulci's next zombie flick took place on an island... nice hand off, someone did their homework.",Dawn of the Dead
672,CaptainJackass33,The Greatest horror Movie Ever,10,7 February 2006,"2004's Dawn of the Dead is possibly the greatest horror movie ever. In 1968 indie filmmaker George A. Romero reinvented horror movies with the cult classic Night of the Living Dead. A few years later he brought the sequel Dawn of the Dead, still one of the highest grossing independent films ever. Director Zach Snyder keeps up the tradition with his 2004 remake of the classic. Snyder's simplistic idea of zombies running brought a whole new kind of terror to our generation. Instead of pussy-footing' around, this movie jumps straight into the action and oh is it sweet. This movie has possibly the greatest opening credits in movie history. The movie still has the same scenario of survivors trapped in a shopping mall which is surrounded by flesh-eating monsters. The actors performances allow you to get sucked into this movie all the sooner. I love everything about this movie, especially the color of this film. The makeup effects in this film are spectacular. The original theme of the film was about humans never being satisfied and the remake does keep this theme and also gives it an Alamo feel. Dawn of the Dead is non-stop horror action and truly gives justice to the original and should not be missed. I hope Zach Snyder is here to stay because he seems to be one of the few directors who knows what he is doing. If you only see one horror movie in your entire life make it this one. I give dawn of the dead 10 stars out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
673,patrick-rutledge,great remake,9,21 March 2006,"this is definitely one of the better remakes. I would have to say this movie is actually better than George Romero's original 1978 version, which was also pretty damn good. Starts off with one of the most frightening scenes of the movie. A group of non-infected civilians bunker down in an abandoned shopping mall and join forces with a few rental cops. They then struggle to survive and fight off what seems to be a never ending on-slaught of zombies who want to enter the mall. One thing that differentiates these zombies from others is that they have some pep in their step, they can run! The actors play convincing roles. There is extensive violence and gore, especially in the uncut DVD. You can clearly see this was produced with a decent budget by a major studio (universal). I highly recommend this movie. Get the uncut version on DVD if possible.",Dawn of the Dead

After a long wait, I was finally able to go see the remake of DOTD, and I must say it kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.  I loved the apocalyptic feel in the beginning.  Seeing society breaking down lets you now that this isnt just the plight of a few people in a farm house.  The special effects are great, its refreshing to see zombies booking at full speed toward people.  As soom people mentioned before, I thought it was hilarious when the character ""Andy"" was picking off ""celebrities"" from the roof top.  It is a fun, fast paced horror movie that will get your heart pumping, with a little bit of comedy relief thrown in.  Maybe im biased, but 10 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
675,peterbiserke,Terrible,1,1 April 2006,"I just watched this movie with some friends yesterday, well, we tried to watch the movie... We got bored out of our minds by its stupidity, and turned it off after an hour... I mean, who has ever heard of a zombie that sprints, and has superhuman strength capabilities?!?! Ever since the whole ""Zombie"" idea came about, they have always been slow, with arms flailing. But no, in ""Dawn of the Dead,"" these zombies come charging, running at the same speed of a car, and can bash their heads through doors. So, after watching a little girl DOMINATE this big dude, their was about an hour, of nothing... The people, inside a mall, just chilling there. An occasional zombie will just pop out of nowhere. Then the big tough police dude wants to leave, and go find his brother, (which, my guess is saying that his brother is dead,) finally comes to his senses, and decides to stay. Then he has this conversation with big chalk board, with a dude, five roofs away. Not long after this is when we turned it off, and decided to watch something else. Overall, this movie was terrible. And to my knowledge, their is a ""Day of the Dead"" which comes right after this one, with only two survivors, then after that, ""Land of the Dead,"" which, basically, Zombies learn to use guns, and just kill off everybody... This movie was not that good at all, overall, I disliked it a lot. And, I won't even try to watch it again... So, take my advice... don't watch this, unless you are a fan of Fast Zombies, (Which is fine, just abnormal.) Yeah... hope this message portrayed my thoughts to people, because this movie is WAY OVERRATED!!!! Alright, good enough. Bye",Dawn of the Dead

679,labtop,"A true masterpiece, this movie is the pinnacle of the horror genre",10,4 January 2007,"Never before has a film had such a remarkable combination of perfect acting, an imaginative and lurid plot, and above all, believability. No movie has ever had such an impact on me, not even any of the hundreds of movies I have watched when I was a child. No accolades or awards will ever do this film justice. Dawn of the dead is the pinnacle of the horror genre. Nowadays, many movies have resorted to sudden plot twists and ridiculous dues ex machinas and other hanky-panky acting to keep its viewers awake. This is especially true in the horror genre. However, this movie of sheer perfection is completely realistic yet still contains all the undertones and values in United States as well as all the common plot devices.A mere ordinary American is subjected to an unimaginable horror in a way that seems far less distant than the other scenarios in other movies. This American is neither an omnipotent hero nor a coward, but an ordinary American. At first, the death and carnage is shocking to her, along with many others she is stuck with, but in the mall with all the now-abandoned merchandise, a disquieting routine sets in that shows the characters happily enjoying the luxury of the place rather than thinking of solutions. Eventually, conflicts between the characters threaten the survival of all, while a vastly greater conflict looms. It is under the duress of this scenario that all the facets of the ordinary Americans brought together in the mall is represented. For example, CJ, the most colorful character is a problem solver and rational man who has the most exceptional physical abilities as well. Most of the other characters get in his way but all have different ways to respond to the situation. It is because of this realism that CJ's final heroic act (that would have only been written off as senseless violence in other horror movies) is so heart warming and powerful. That simple scene was the most powerful scene in any movie I have seen because it represents what a true American hero would do in such a scenario completely accurately. He doesn't have a full two minutes to say a goodbye to his girlfriend, he isn't gonna save all mankind by single-handedly stopping a barrage of nuclear missiles, he isn't going to protect earth from destruction by aliens, but he does act in the heat of battle to perform one final believable heroic act. This is the only movie I would ever give more than a perfect 10/10 for, nothing compares to its elegance.",Dawn of the Dead
680,PG Alonzo,the trailer was better than the movie !,7,29 March 2004,"The trailer for the movie was good.  Too bad the movie wasn't.  The eerie images had sensational angles, shadows, and lighting accompanied with music that matched went well during the trailer. It's a shame that we didn't see a lot of that in the movie.  It made the movie seem stylish and scary. When the film stops, melts, and the zombies try to come for the audience out of the screen, that was a pretty clever way to end the trailer.  They should have made the movie end that way, too!  Most of the scenes in the trailer were at the beginning of the movie before the opening credits.  In the movie, the director drew the viewer's attention to certain things that ended up to be insignificant.  What was the point?  Could it be to make us think it's going to have an interesting plot with twists?  Well, don't think too hard about anything that goes on because it's pointless.  Were the zombies everywhere?  How far do you have to go to get away from them?  And why did everyone end up at the mall?  Did the mall employees all turn into real zombies?  They should have put in computer generated flies around all the zombies.  Now that would have been clever!  This was supposed to be a horror movie, but it ended up more like a ""HORRORble"" drama with a few thrills thrown in during the first ten minutes.",Dawn of the Dead
681,sic_slipknot_maggot_freak,way more entertaining than original,10,21 March 2004,"Remakes. that word sometimes makes me cringe. we have a slew of them getting churned out of hollywood these days. some work, i.e. the ring and the texas chainsaw massacre and well, some don't. (shaft always comes to mind on this one.)as i entered the theatre with my wife and brother, my expectations were high for this. after a few trailers we were off and running. i had already previewed the first ten minutes of this film on the USA network and i was already intrigued. From there, the movie never let's down. We are quickly met with a few survivors who, as anyone already knows, decides to take refuge in the mall. When they arrive in the mall, they meet up with a few security guards and decide to whole up there for a while. later on, a few more survivors show up and carnage ensues.Now, what makes this one more different and better to me than the original are these few things:1.)when they arrive at the mall, it's closed. hasn't even open for business yet so there are no zombies inside.2.) the use of shuttle busses at the end was creative. i like that touch. use what you got.3.) the humor was excellent4.) the characters were great, especially cj and michael and ving rhames character. sarah polley was given a strong female character in ana. thank you for giving a strong actress a strong role.this movie is far better than the original and if you don't sit through the credits, you may miss something special.by the way, the whole baby thing almost lost me on this movie, that was the only one cheese factor.",Dawn of the Dead

It was a all around on edge movie but it had a chilling sense to the hole thing. So when you are sitting there laughing then you think about it for a second then its scarier. It had a wonderful chainsaw seen that really showed the proper safety's when be heading zombies. Its a great movie to watch all around. And watch it with friends cause some of them will hate gore and its funny to watch them get sick. Another thing i loved about this movie is the realistic. It a had a wonderful gore sense but not fake. The weapons were well creative. You have your stander pistol shotguns and a trade mark weapon the chainsaw. But u also had a few other items in the mall they used such as a Axe racket and other sporting good items. The chainsaw seen could have been longer but it succeeded my anticipation of its gore effect. I really liked the music to. It was perfect for the mode. johnny cash was a perfect, and the mall music was funny because when that door opens it all out gore and terror!!!. i also loved the end it scared me good. The last thing i loved about this movie is the fact that the zombies run. I hate movies were the villain never chase down and attack. In this movie it gave a great sense of terror.

Every time I see a zombie in a movie I'm always like ""They can outrun it easily,"" and suddenly on the very next frame you see someone getting run down by a zombie and that's when you know it's scripted and that's when it takes away the thought of ""What If It Really Happens?"".

Although they're still...well...RETARDED, (they are ZOMBIES after all) the fact that they SPRINT towards their victims in order to eat them alive is enough to haunt your dreams.If you took the time to actually READ this particular comment and you HAVEN'T seen the film...GO AND RENT THE MOVIE NOW! Not tomorrow or next week...RIGHT NOW!",Dawn of the Dead
688,whitecat8,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!",9,29 September 2009,"Let me start out by saying that I have not seen the original movie... well not at least all the way through. But I imagine that if any other movie would make a perfect remake of it, it would be this one.When I first saw the movie, I hadn't heard of it, so as a typical horror-survival horror movie fan I wasn't expecting anything. About 10 minutes into the masterpiece, I found myself on the edge of the seat. The movie wastes no time on the unimportant, but really gets through to the viewers.The best thing about the movie was probably the behavior of the people trapped in the mall - how they really looked out for each other (well, at least some of them) but meanwhile were ready to do about anything to save their own lives. Specially loved the Andy/Kenneth relationship.*SPOILERS*The cast was also perfect, as were the dialogs, writings, etc. There really is nothing bad to say about the movie. So why did I give it 9/10? Because the red-head (can't remember her name) really angered me when she was risking her and the group's life when going after that stupid dog. But in the end it did become the breaking point of the movie - they had to leave their secure mall and head out. It's still one of my favorite movies ever. Great job! Keep 'em coming.",Dawn of the Dead
689,fwg-1,Classic Remake of Classic Film,10,2 April 2004,"I'm astonished that this movie is as good as it is.I had heard good things about the job Snyder did with it,but was stunned to find it is as good as Romero's original film.I saw the original back when it came out(1978?)and have been a big Romero fan since.I cant believe I'm saying this,but Romero may have been out done in sheer intensity.Sure,the social commentary which was so out front in the original barely registers here,but this one never lets you take a breath.While watching this movie I found myself so involved with the characters and thier actions that I had to stop myself from hollering at the damn movie screen when they were in danger.I wanted to help them.The acting is really good.The gore effects are stunning.If you like Zombie movies,or love George Romero,go see this movie.A+++",Dawn of the Dead
690,svmpsguy,Superior to Romero,9,15 October 2009,"Note: my opinions will cause a furor to die hard fans of the original.I am old enough to remember watching Romero's original. Even as a teen, it struck me that the acting was bad, the zombies looked blue and some of the pacing was poor. The scope of this movie feels much bigger.Synders remake is superior in every way. Starting with the cast. the acting is just fine for the horror genre. The characters are less cardboard and cartoony than in Romeros. The effects are consistent and more realistic. The zombies are far higher quality and in more advanced states of decay, not just ""blue"". In this version, the zombies run. This didn't sit will with fans of the original. Given that the undead are a relentless menace that can be anywhere, this story amps them up. They have primitive hunting skills, strength like a human on meth, and they don't hesitate. They can climb and perform simple tasks. They are far more believable as a menace than slow, dumb, ambling zombies. you can't just pie these zombies in the face like a black comedy, they will run you down. They will stalk you like a rabid wolf, so you can't just cross an fence or climb a ladder and be safe.This films pace is far better, it does not lag like the original. The sub plot of Andy in his gun shop is masterful addition to play off in the story. You feel genuine sympathy for the character. You also feel a sense of hope when the cast develops a solution to escaping the mall situation. When they are escaping, there is a iconic scene of throngs of zombies you won't forget. It's an awesome spectacle that really sells the idea that they are outnumbered 400,000 to 1 by the undead.This movie does not resort to camp like the original, and there is a lot of action, and a lot of gore. It has a much glossier feel to it than the original and holds up to repeated viewings much better. I suggest you watch it in black and white for a different experience. This is the best (serious) zombie movie since night of the living dead. it is underrated by the rabid fans of the original. Young people who see this version first will not enjoy the original. They will look at the original as a cheap movie with slow, stupid zombies. If you like zombie movies, this is top shelf.",Dawn of the Dead
691,dustyabell,what an amazing surprise!,10,15 April 2004,"i really enjoyed this film. i'm a big fan of the original (and can't wait for the big oversized dvd set coming out towards the end of summer) and i enjoyed this rethinking of the basic premise of it a hell of a lot. great ensemble cast, innovative direction and killer musical cues. (johnny cash and the vegas lounge version of down with the sickness were friggin inspired) i sure hope the longer form dvd gives us a bit more on the character side, cause these people were far from 1 dimensional and i want to learn more about them all. favorite scene was the overhead helicopter shot of sarah fleeing in her car and the surprise event that happens right in front of her on the highway, it was the money shot that ended a 10 minute roller coaster ride that was the beginning of the movie.
(SPOILER)- man i hope they got away from those undead b**tards on that island, we never technically saw them killed, so i suppose there is  a slim  chance they managed to get away. i want twighlight of the dead from the same people responsible for this film, i want ving and sarah and the kids, and i want it sooner rather than later. this was a fun flick!",Dawn of the Dead
692,borntohula,Hooray for Sheriff Sex Machine!!!,8,25 March 2004,"Having only ""28 days later"" and the Simpson's Halloween specials as reference for zombies, I'd say this is an excellent zombie-stompin movie. The roles played by the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" cast were also very cool. It lacks the social commentary of previous zombie flicks, but it doesn't detract from the experience.The film makes a point of establishing the reality of the world pre-zombie takeover, so the frequent defiance against of the laws of physics is troubling for some (anal science freaks like me). A filled propane tank ways 40 lbs. and there is no freakin way that they can be thrown that far, regardless of a ripped physique. Also, the number of direct headshots delivered by handguns is completely ludicrous, but now I'm being petty. If these attacks against the laws of nature scare the bejeebas out of you, maybe zombie flicks aren't for you.Snyder does a good job for a first time out director and the cinematography is superb. The music selections seem odd at first, but suit the film (all hail Richard Cheese!).8/10",Dawn of the Dead
693,jackastro,Entertaining as Hell,8,17 March 2004,"Having recently seen the original (I bought it so I could get the Hellboy Sneak Preview DVD, plus I own Night of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead, I went into seeing the reimagining (the new Hollywood buzzword for remake) with an idea of why the first has such a huge reputation among horror fans.The original is slowly paced with a small cast.  The makeup is generally crappy, but some of the splatter effects are pretty good.  The blood looks like reddish paint.  The characters are pretty well drawn out and well-rounded.  The shopper mentality allegory still holds up well.  All in all, a pretty good movie, and I can see how it would have been somewhat revolutionary for it's time.  Romero knows his zombies.Fast forward almost 20 years and enter James Gunn, the writer of Scooby Doo the Movie and The Specials.The Specials, if you haven't seen it, is an extremely funny superhero parody film, and in my opinion, better than the bigger budgeted Mystery Men, which came out at the same time.  However you couldn't pay me enough to watch Scooby Doo.  I won't even watch the cartoons.Dawn of the Dead is definitely a post-28 Days Later zombie film.  The camerawork is flashy, yet at times, grainy, the zombies move at a lightning pace, chasing and often outrunning their victims.  Even aside from being a remake, the ideas are culled from every other influential zombie flick of the past twenty years, with subtle nods to the Evil Dead series, Dead Alive, 28 Days Later, etc.Despite the inherent flaws, the movie accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.  It's a scary movie.  Everyone in the audience jumped exactly when we were supposed to.  We were grossed out when we needed to be, and we laughed when it was deliberately funny.  Overall, it's just a highly entertaining movie.The basic plot follows Ana (Sarah Polley from Go) as she wakes up one morning to find her neighbor's daughter in her hallway.  Ana's husband goes to the girl, only to get his throat ripped out, kicking off the action forthe rest of the film.  Ana flees, horrified, refusing to be approached by anyone, living or dead.  Shortly thereafter, she runs into Kenneth (Ving Rhames of Pulp Fiction), a cop heading toward an alleged safe area. Almost as soon as they set off together, they meet three survivors who have decided to seek refuge in the local mall.  Of course, at the mall, they meet a handful of other survivors, and begin to formulate a plan of escape.There are quite a few scenes of solid character building, making the major characters into real individuals, however the supporting cast are generally just caricatures.  But overall, there are just simply a lot of ""cool"" bits that, sure, they may be just filler, but it's interesting and exciting filler.Some of the cast of the original ""Dawn"" make cameos.  Ken Foree (Peter from the original) plays a televangelist, and gets to say the tagline in both films (When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth). Tom Savini (Special FX guru, and a biker from the original film) plays a sheriff who figures out a way to kill the zombies.Matt Frewer also has about 2 minutes worth of screen time in the film.  It made me sad, mostly to think that this is now his career.  Poor Matt Frewer.There is another character in the film named Steve, and the entire time he was onscreen, I could only think one thing: ""That should have been Bruce Campbell.""  The actor playing Steve looks like a younger Bruce Campbell, the character has that sort of smarmy, cocky charm of a Bruce Campbell character, he just should have been Bruce Campbell.The soundtrack surprised and impressed me.  Being a big budget studio popcorn/action film, I expected a soundtrack full of the latest altnewxradio friendly fm rock bands.  Instead, the music is mostly very offsetting to the film, giving it a little more of a creepy edge.  The opening credits are run to the tune of Johnny Cash's ""When the Man Comes Around"".  On the other hand, the end credits have Disturbed's ""Sickness"" playing, but to offset that, during the movie, the same song is played, but performed by Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine.  I may seek out the soundtrack.All in all, I loved this movie, it creeped me out.  I love/hate zombies, and this did well by the zombie genre.Stick around for the end credits.  All of them.",Dawn of the Dead
694,TheAverageAtBestHulk,Dawn of the average film...,6,21 March 2004,"I had insanely high hopes for this movie when I first saw the trailer a month and a half ago.  I don't know exactly what I expected, but I think I expected to much.In one of the first scenes, we see a girl skating away into the sunset, we know trouble lurks ahead.  That's fine and dandy, foresight, it's all good, but this movie ends up being so predictable in every scene to the point where it is boring.  Granted, we do get a few good surprises, but every time someone goes off alone, you know a zombie will be somewhere waiting. Every time you see a fail safe plan put in by the actors, you can almost forsee it verbatim, and that's what horror is not about.  At least not to me.  Maybe I was expecting an Evil Dead quality film.But i'm not all dissatisfied, you see.  The movie has style, humor and an overall feeling of hopelessness.  The zombies look great and the special effects aren't bad.  The actors, while convieniently labeled personality wise (or not developed at all) do a good, convincing job.  I would recommend this to a horror fan in a second.  But if your looking for the feeling that famous trailer gave you, you might want to go elsewhere.Also, Johnny Cash, and Richard Cheese, the people who put this movie together have good taste in music.",Dawn of the Dead
695,skull73,Surprisingly good remake of a classic,8,15 May 2004,"As I first saw the trailer of DOTD 2004 I had a bad feeling. I've seen so many awful remakes of great movies. But this one really surprised me.Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a great horror movie with thrill, style, very good art direction and perfect (very gory) special effects. The mood is spot on and gives me the same feel like the original. The music is totally diffrent than the old Goblin stuff, but it also works very well. I was glad to see some of the original crew like Ken Foree and Tom Savini. Nice touch.All in all a ""must see"" not only for fans.",Dawn of the Dead

The storyline and jolts were evenly distributed throughout that film. The humour was placed at a perfect point. I loved when they shot the zombies and labled them as ""Jay Leno"" and ""Burt Reynolds"". I thought that was sooo great. (SPOILERS) I didn't like how the ending went through the credits.It didn't ruin the movie, but I sorta wish they would have kept going with the ending without the credits interrupting what happened next. That was my short review. All together i really liked this movie and encourage those who like horror films to see this.",Dawn of the Dead
698,LordSlaytan,"It's not Romero, but it's not Rob Zombie either.",8,22 March 2004,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I haven't seen George Romero's version of Dawn of the Dead since it was first released on videotape, so I really can't say how faithful Gunn and Snyder followed the original story. I have heard that the original was more than a standard horror movie, but also a social commentary on American commercialism and consumption. Be that as it may, it doesn't detract from the fact that this newer version is a fun, fun movie with its own strengths and message. The message of course is that if you run across a zombie that looks like Jay Leno or Burt Reynolds, shoot the hell out of it and laugh your ass off, because there aren't too many things to guffaw at when the whole world wants to chew on you.The opening begins with Ana (Polley), a registered nurse in Everett, Wisconsin who is just leaving the hospital when her shift is over. When she pulls into her driveway, she sees the precocious Vivian, an 11-year-old neighbor girl who wants to show off just how adorable she is by showing Ana her newest rollerblading skill. Ana goes into her home, has amazing standing up in the shower while the water chafes your skin sex with her loving and perfect husband (who cares what his name is, he's Alpo five minutes later), and lays down for a peaceful sleep befitting an Angel.When morning comes, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, all is pure Disney until cute little Vivian enters the bedroom because either her television is on the blink, or there's no more raw meat at home to satiate her new born hunger. Poor old no-name husband feels sorry for the bloody darling because he knows what it's like to miss The Power Puff Girls and runs to Vivian's side to console her; then wham-o! No-name is running around with teeth marks in his neck and trying to scream, which is hard to do when you have a gaping hole in your throat. Somehow, Ana is able to put a door in between her and Vivian, who happens to still be hungry, and watches as her husband dies.and rises again. Instead of jumping joyously screaming, `It's a miracle!' Ana is fighting for her life because no-name would rather eat her instead of his usual bran muffin, which is wholly understandable. Ana barely escapes with her breasts still on her chest instead of in no-names gullet, runs out to their car, and there we get to see one of the coolest, `We're not in Kansas anymore' sequences ever made. Her once peaceful and placid neighborhood is now an open buffet for the undead. Fire and screaming is everywhere she looks, people running for their lives, and other people running for their breakfast. Ana gets into her car just in time before her husband can goose her from behind, peels out of her driveway, and hauls ass to anywhere but there while her husband chases her, which he quits doing once he sees some other prey unlucky enough not to make it to his Desoto. From a bird's eye view, we see Ana driving pell-mell on the highway where she causes a truck to swerve into an old farmhouse causing a spectacular explosion.then the opening credits appear.I was hooked, so was most of the packed theater there to see the show. I've got to hand it to Gunn and Snyder, because they really know how fish. I was baited, hooked, and reeled in only 10 minutes into the movie. The audience was thrilled. People were yelling, cheering, and laughing from beginning to end. Everyone was overjoyed with the special effects, the shock, and the dark humor that's prevalent throughout the film. I really enjoyed the subtle humor used with the 'muzak' used over the loud speakers in the mall.I'm sure that you all know that the survivors make it to a mall and that's where they make their stand, if you want to call it that. We meet the cop Kenneth (Rhames), a big giant bad-ass with a shotgun and an attitude, Michael (Webber), a guy that first appears to be there to either be a living villain or weakling, but becomes a principle character with fortitude and intelligence, Andre (Phifer), who is accompanied with his soon-to-be-bursting-baby wife, Luda (Korobkina) and CJ (Kelly), a security guard who has a superiority complex and a gun. The rest of the people may as well have worn their red Star Trek uniforms, which doesn't mean they all bite it, but that they aren't the emotional center of the movie at this point.But, the true stars of any zombie film are the zombies. I know that, you know that, and fortunately for us, Gunn and Snyder know that. No more of the lumbering hulks that are only dangerous if a character gets trapped or if the character happens to be a female. In Dawn of the Dead, the zombies have all taken track in high school. They run at blistering speeds, show acrobatic talents as they fly through the air, and swallow their food without adhering to the Surgeon General's warning that every bite should be chewed 26 times. They also show a greater strength in their problem solving skills, unless, of course, figuring something out would be detrimental to the plot.If you're only there for the gore, you won't be disappointed. There's enough of that to keep even the most disturbed individuals anchored in their seats. There are also some really cool explosions, imaginative death scenes, a cute little doggy to feel afraid for, and a very large body count. It also shows why you shouldn't play with Daddy's chainsaw while standing up in a fast moving truck, just in case you weren't sure. If more horror films followed the example laid out by 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead, there just might be hope for the waning horror industry. I might just become a fan again.",Dawn of the Dead
699,fotobosse,It's nothing I can recommend.,1,4 December 2004,"The plot is about a female nurse, named Anna, is caught in the middle of a world-wide chaos as flesh-eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living. She escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. So far, so good! I usually enjoy horror movies, but this piece of film doesn't deserve to be called horror. It's not even thrilling, just ridiculous.Even ""the Flintstones"" or ""Kukla, Fran and Ollie"" will give you more excitement. It's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor. The heroes who has locked themselves in, inside the shopping-mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside, are not better either. Even though they doesn't seem to be drunk, they give the impression of being mentally disabled. Save your money instead of spending it on this!",Dawn of the Dead
700,poinconneur,fun at the mall !!!,7,4 July 2004,"I thought this movie was good, fun in many situations, not very scary if you have seen horror before but good entertainment for a Saturday night. The only thing that bothered me was the color of the blood that flooded in the movie: not natural. The bad guy did a good job playing the pain in the ass. And what's a good thing in my eyes too: the color of the people didn't matter in this plot to their chances on survival.the fact that it wasn't so scary for me can be explained a bit because of the fact that similar scenes e.g. fights with the enraged undead appear in for example '28 days later'. Compared to 28D's the storyline of this movie is a little lighter. More concentrated on suspense.",Dawn of the Dead

Romero, you won't like Remake. I consider The Dawn of the Dead 2004 to be one of the worst remakes in the history of filmaking.  Dawn of the Dead 2004 is nothing like the original it was intended to be remade in, on the contrary, its its own movie.  It should not have been called dawn of the dead.  The original Dawn of the dead had excellent character build and delicious old school make up effects by Tom Savini.  The zombies were slow and stupid hence the name ""zombie"".  The Remake has far too many characters to like, accept maybe Ken ( Vingh Rahmes).  The Remake also had a diffrent breed of zombies than the original, the fast zombie which is a rip off of 28 days later.  The original Dawn of the dead is actually a HORROR movie.  The remake is more of and action suspense movie.  If you want to see a beautiful candy colored zombie movie watch the original ( 10/10) if you want to watch an action/thriller/suspense/monster movie then watch the new dawn of the dead(-10/10) starring vingh rahmes and sarah polly.",Dawn of the Dead
702,taker4life,faster and scarier by miles leaps and bounds.....,10,20 March 2004,"the zombies do that too by the way. this dawn was going to be a 1 in a million shot. it would either be #1: another hollywood remake that brings in the bucks, but leaves out the entertainment.  or #2: a fast frantic ride thru hell with very little room for it's characters and story. well it's #1 and #2 in a nice neat little package that IS another hollywood remake and it WILL bring in the bucks, but the entertainment is not only there but it often times feels so pressed in upon you that you have to crouch in your'e seat and just surrender to it. and #2 it IS a VERY fast and frantic ride thru hell but it actually seems to - be prepared to gasp - CARE FOR SOME OF IT'S CHARACTERS! the story is the same as it was in the original but this go-round we get to see it happen from the very beginning, the onslaught of what's to come.*but be warned this is a blood-soaked movie from 3 minutes in, to the last name in the credits* grade A entertainment!!!",Dawn of the Dead
703,tdarwish2,Could have been REALLY good....,6,28 January 2006,"Just for the record, I'm a die-hard Romero fan. I didn't mind the running zombies one bit...I thought the opening was first-rate, as well as the title sequence/montage. The zombie baby was OUTSTANDING, and was something I'd pondered and debated with fellow Romero fans for years. Even the VERY end of the movie (during the closing credits) was rather disturbing. I'm glad they removed the proposed scene w/the ""zombie dogs"" (and truth be told, I'm equally happy that Romero removed the proposed ""zombie rats"" sequence out of LOTD). The makeup was terrific, and the gore/head-shot effects were top-notch.I don't know a thing about making movies. But I can get a feel for good dialog writing as opposed to not-so-good dialog writing. I gave the movie a 6/10 solely due to the fact that most of the dialog was TERRIBLE. This was mainly the case when everyone got to the mall, and seemed to continue from there on out. Even despite CJ's redemption toward the end which makes him likable, he has some of the WORST and corny lines. Everyone (as seems to be the case in mainstream horror movies) was written to try to act and talk ""too cool,"" and at times did not behave at all the way that people would behave (even in a melodramatic way) if this situation were to actually happen.Maybe it's just that I'm not sure whether the creators were going for a serious or satirical zombie movie. I don't think a good balance is achieved here. The opening is EXTREMELY serious, and then 45 minutes later, Kenneth and Andy are shooting celebrity look-alike zombies from the rooftop of the mall and laughing; Steve's getting some down below, and two twenty-somethings are having a relationship blossom by laughing and having fun after they just shot the girl's father an hour earlier (a VERY serious and sad scene). It just goes from WAY light-hearted to WAY serious too many times, IMHO.Overall this is a good movie, and I do watch it every so often. (6/10)",Dawn of the Dead
704,soliloquy_girl,"Zombies, violence, sex and shopping malls... What more could a girl ask for?",10,27 June 2004,"***This contains spoilers - I have tried to keep them relatively non-specific, but you have been warned :D***I must confess that I have never seen the original take on this film, and to tell the truth, the teasers I had seen for this remake had me thinking that I would be spending my boyfriend's hard earned cash on yet another cheesy gore-fest. I was so incredibly wrong!This film is incredible. The early normality as Ana (Polley) concludes her shift, and goes home to her suburban life only heightens the complete horror that follows. Aside from an undercurrent of foreboding, the audience can almost be lulled into a false sense of security that everything will be OK...And that is when the fun starts! What follows is one of the most amazing, action packed couple of hours of horror, blood and gore that audiences have been exposed to in the past couple of years. This film delivers where recent zombie exploits (28 Days Later, Undead, Resident Evil) have failed to. For a start, we see the 'disease' spread. The footage that depicts the spread of the mayhem is AMAZING - look out for the awesome aerial shots! And have I mentioned that these zombies are FAST and totally relentless, drawn to the living like bees to honey? They aren't incredibly smart, but what they lack in intelligence they make up for in determination, speed and their incredible ugliness (kudos to the make up team). Our heroine joins with other survivors, taking refuge at the local mall (all of those stores at their disposal - how sensible of them!) which was locked and somehow remained almost free of infection. One of the many highlights of this film is its ability to make the seamless switch from absolute horror to hilarious comedy, as our heroes make light of their situation; running amok in the mall (as you would!) and playing zombie celebrity shoot-out with the owner of a neighboring store. There are definite problems with the introduction of characters, as other survivors join our original five. It is hard to keep track of faces, let alone all of their names and relationships to each other. However, to the actors' credit, and because of the nature of the script, the audience feels for these people, no matter how shallow, or one-dimensional they are, because they have lost all that they know; family, friends, everything to this zombie plague.This film is sharp, fast-paced and well made (especially considering the director's previous credit is 'Scooby Doo'). The score and soundtrack are extremely cool, as are the opening and closing credits, and the film's ending is one of the most original I have seen in years. It is something that horror fans are going to want to see on the big screen; the explosive special effects and cool action scenes aren't going to come across as well on the small screen. Not everyone will love this film, it is bloody and relentless, but if action packed horror is your genre of choice (or if you have ever dreamed of having a mall at your disposal), I recommend Dawn of the Dead... Go, go see it now!",Dawn of the Dead
705,nick-m,I'm positively surprised!,9,18 March 2004,"There is no need to talk about the many qualities of the original 1978 `Dawn Of The Dead' here. George A. Romero's movie has long since  been a movie classic, not only in the horror category. It is no surprise then, that in times of annoying remakes like `The Getaway' or the upcoming `Assault On Precinct 13', a certain feeling of scepticism is at hand when it comes to Zack Snyder's updated version of `Dawn Of The Dead'. Beside the fact that there is no need to redo a perfect movie, Snyder, as a director of commercials, didn't seem the best of choices to do the job. But maybe we were a bit prejudiced here. Snyder did a good job, he even did an outstanding job. Just as Romero's movie has many satiric elements and comments on the society of the 70's, his version perfectly mirrors today's fast paced society. A lot of action replaces atmosphere, comic relief replaces irony and unstoppable killing machines replace the old somnanbulists. But it all works out extremely well. With all the action, fast cutting and contemporary music, `Dawn Of The Dead 2004' really kicks ass. And it's owing to Snyder, that even the character development doesn't come short. Needless to say that this is not a character study like Romero's original, although Snyder manages to provide his panopticum of archetypes with enough twists and turns to develop sympathy. My advice is to watch this as independently of the original as possible. You will be rewarded with a roller coaster ride and maybe with one of the best genre movies the still young century has to offer.",Dawn of the Dead

708,Blueshirt476,re-make done right,10,19 March 2004,"****Possible Spoilers**** I had the pleasure of driving past the Monroeville Mall just after watching the Re-Make of Dawn of the Dead...(which for diehards is where the first movie was filmed)...But anyways I would have to say I loved this movie, Sure the characters weren't as developed as the orginal but this one was more fast paced and too the point.  I liked the effect of having the more people inside that mall which lead to more people being picked off one by one. The gore was done right with just enough head shots and to say head impalings to go around.  The chainsaw on the bus was pretty cool idea too and to people that have seen know what happens with said chainsaw!!! The celebrity shooting game also made me laugh out loud. My only real problem is with the ending. Which is cool in it's own but could have been a bit more clearer, hey I'm a guy that likes closure so sue me. I just hope that this movie will inspire Romero to make a fourth film or for Zack to make another sequel. But overall I think people should just sit back and enjoy a great zombie movie with plenty splats and shocks..",Dawn of the Dead
709,Shotcalla39,Great modern day horror flick. The original 'Dawn' is of course better. But this one delivers a great plot like the original.,10,19 March 2004,"I saw this movie with my mother and my sister at 6:45 Eastern Time. I'm a die hard fan of Romero's 'Dead"" Trilogy and am still very skeptical about this movie.  However,  it's one of the best horror films in years along with titles like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Ring', and for longtime fans of horror movies 'Freddy vs. Jason'.  I might add that 'Jason X' was one of the worst in years.  But it feels good that they're bringing back the classics and not ruining them as we've seen in years past.
The opening scene of the 2004 re-make of 'Dawn' is a great way to get your audience involved with a movie.  The gore, the athlete fast zombies, and some disturbing images are a good way to get this movie going.  The make-up was outstanding and the 'twitching' zombies were pretty cool. Seeing Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, and Tom Savini in the movie were a thrill of its own.  However, they only had 20 seconds each in the film.  I believe they should have been involved a little bit more in the movie.
The acting overall was great.  Ving Rhames delivers a kick-ass performance.  More characters were in this movie to make it seen on many different point of views.  The gore is alright but the DVD should give us some guts getting teared out of a biker.  Oh, no only that graphic could be on the original 'Dawn'.  But this movie is great on a different level and is guaranteed to be worth seeing once, twice, or a few times.  I think it was better than 28 Days Later.  'Dead' fans already started running to the theater.  ** 3/4 out of 4.",Dawn of the Dead
710,cmbeegee,Awful,1,7 April 2004,"You'll stop trying to save this movie. Stop trying to defend the producer. Horror fans stop trying to justify this as a must see movie. A child's imagination could put on a better zombie movie. The Mummy was a better movie. The mall scene, dumb. Malls are full of glass walls. All the zombies had to do was get his zombie arm and break the glass. A river of zombees, and the nurse escapes everything, impossible. As fast as those zombie moved, the nurse should have been bitten in the hospital.",Dawn of the Dead

This movie didnt really look that entertaining, and the zombie genre has been done before. But I had nothing else to do that day, so we bought tickets to Hidalgo and snuck into Dawn Of The Dead. Now, the movie takes place in Wisconsin, and actually mentions the city where I live, and I was completely shocked. I dont think you would realize how awesome it is to hear recognition for where you live when you dont get recognized that much. The movie, although sometimes unrealistic, is overall enjoyable. It has its funny moments, and moment where you question the actors choice. Example: Why the hell would you drive through a crowd of zombies to save a dog? Stupidity as its greatest. But in any case, the effects were good, and this is a good way to spend 2 hours, so I recommend going out and seeing this movie, and visit Waukesha sometime soon. We'll be waiting for you...",Dawn of the Dead
712,supernothing,"Nice Film, But Falls Still At Some Points",7,31 May 2004,"I went into this film skeptical, judging from the content and quality of past ""zombie movies"", but this film surpassed my expectations at most times, but at times, it fell short of those same expectations. The film has a nice soundtrack and overall, the sounds period. The music leaves you wondering what's going to be at the next corner, but most of the time it is nothing, leaving you wondering when something WILL happen, and you never know when so it just jumps out at you.I had an epiphany tonight. I thought that all remakes of ""B-flicks"" had to have cheesy blood and skin effects. I was wrong here. The blood and gore is done near perfectly, the blood and wounds realistic and you feel how bad it would be if those events were taking place on you.There is no long ""set-up"" for it, but we jump right into an interesting story that doesn't have many stale points. At times, the story does get kind of lame like a ""B-flick"", which is slow and overdone, but that doesn't prevent this movie from giving you the zombie goodness that you want.One argument that I have with this film is that we never become enlightened on the origin of the zombies. It would of been nice if we could of at least known the reason the zombies were appearing. Maybe if they would of remade ""Night Of the Living Dead"" first that disappointment would not be in existence.Overall, a nice movie, but has its bad parts, like any film. The acting isn't stale and stiff, and the actors fit into the characters perfectly. I'd recommend this movie for any zombie-movie-junkie, but if you're easily queased, don't see this unless you expect to cover your eyes a lot of the time.John Hughes (with the assistance of Cory Darenzo)",Dawn of the Dead
713,SuperGus,"Fresh, yet not fresh",7,26 May 2004,"First of all, I am a HUGE horror fan and I've been dying to see the new Dawn of the Dead. I hate to admit this, but I finally just saw it this weekend (5/22!!) You at least have to give me props for checking it out on the big screen, even if it was at the cheap-o movie theater. It was $3.75 well spent! Even though the movie was kind of scratchy because i guess it's made it's rounds, I was still pretty much into it. I'm a big fan of the original DOTD. I've owned it on video since high school and I've watched it a lot! So, I wanted to go into watching this remake with a clean slate. Even though I liked this remake, it did seem a lot like 28 Days Later, which I thought was better, but they are both still nothing crazily new or radical on the zombie genre [actually, I think 28 Days Later copied from the original DOTD]. I don't think I'm giving too much away here (plus, if you haven't seen it yet and you're a horror fan, you're worse than me!!), but this is a warning that I might mention a couple of the killings. Anyway, the girl in the beginning who starts out as a nurse is very cute, in a girl next door kind of way. I know I recognize her from something else, but I think she is older and hotter now. Although, her husband in the beginning looks like he could be her dad. Showering with her. Creepy. I wonder what the director Zach's deal is? His directing was really cool, though. I like the opening when the nurse has to escape her own house and then drives through all hell breaking lose in their suburb and the camera keeps backing up further away and you see a car crash into the gas station and it blows up. Once they get trapped in the mall, I think the acting is really good, but I liked all mall stuff in the original DOTD better. But the acting and directing do lift the movie. I liked getting to know the characters and the tension of whose a zombie or not [that fat lady was so totally a zombie  how could they not figure that one out faster?] And, I want to pay mad props to Mhiki Pfieffer for getting his name in a Enimen song and delivering a zombie baby all in the span of one year! I Won't say what happens at the end [the very end] but I liked it. It was cool and wasn't like your typical Hollywood ending per se. So, in a nutshell... Too much like 28 Days Later, and nothing earth shatteringly new or fresh, but still a pretty cool movie, with good acting and directing. I say, go see it!!",Dawn of the Dead
714,l_m_m_s,Nothing Special,3,31 August 2004,"Before I saw this movie a number of people were recommending it as one of their favourite movies.After seeing it myself I cannot see how they could rate it so highly. To me it seemed like just another average horror/disaster movie. It was incredibly similar in plot to 28 Days Later, and provided nothing strikingly original. In my opinion 28 Days Later is better because of the early atmospheric scenes of deserted London, but both movies fall apart towards their ends.Dawn of the Dead does have one saving grace - a scene involving rooftops, celebrities, and a high powered rifle...",Dawn of the Dead
715,Flay3,"Awful, Awful, Awful",4,27 January 2005,"I have to say, though fairly new to the zombie genre, this has to be one of the worst zombie films I have ever seen. I do say that Tom Savini's work is one of his best, but still, flashy gory make up, and flashy explosions do not make up for the loss of plot, depth, character development or over all story in general. This movie breaks with the tradition of zombie characteristics (they can't run, they're dead for God's sake!). I rated this around a 4. This movie would not as bad if solely on it's own merit,however, the fact the director is piggy backing on George Romero's current Trilogy, with out the social messages, or overall script complexity really hurts its rating over all. To dispel accusations that I am anti-new zombie films, or that anyone but Romero can't do a zombie flick, just know this, if you really want to see a good zombie film, go see Sean of the dead.

716,cult_of_sucktitude,Kinda sucked ...,4,14 May 2005,"I was looking forward to seeing this film. Missed it at the theaters and then I didn't get around to renting it until recently. Caught the first ten minutes of the movie when they showed it on TV- great promotional idea for this movie (bad promotional idea for Elektra though, but that's another film altogether ...)I personally didn't get the sense that this phenomenon was global, just that this was a small town gone bad. I do like the opening credit sequence with Cash's vocals and all- very cool! Loved the chaos that ensued at the beginning, loved CJ and the security mall a$$holes once they got inside. After that it become a bit muddled and boring. CJ's character becomes a likable guy for some reason which really sucked because he played such a great bad guy! THe film went from being ... well .. semi-serious to comedic from moment to moment. The Mikhi Pfier sequence didn't really have a good payoff for me. And the single worst part of the movie is when the red head girl risk her life and their rescue mission to save a damn dog!!! WTF? Just like when Rippley saved the cat in Alien, this is a terrible cliché that should not be brought back! Horrible, horrible. Of course, things pick up towards the end and it becomes fun to watch once again. But you know ... the stuff in the middle was just plain terrible. Sarah Polley was really great! So was Ving Rhames. I liked him but i'm not sure why, I guess I just like Ving and that's good enough for me. I enjoyed the zombies as well. Especially Polley's bf that guy just wouldn't stop! I won't compare to the source material, even though I am a Romero and zombie fan but all in all it just wasn't that great of a film. It's all pretty disappointing in the end.",Dawn of the Dead
717,marmotta74,The original one still is the best,5,11 September 2005,"Not a particularly bad movie, no. There are good things about it. One example: the fast zombies. Special effects are newer than in George Romero's original, but not THAT newer, after all. And: gory sequences are not as scary as in the original movie. I believe the feelings of fear, claustrophobia, pain and horror are not as vivid as in the original movie. This movie is occasionally scary, but it just does not manage to reproduce fully the ""magic"" that Romero was so good at. One more thing: I did not like the pseudo-philosophical junk that ""explained"" the zombie plague: we are corrupt, we are evil, there are prostitution, homosexuality, drugs, abortion, blah blah blah...

When the credits start after the intro, there is a song which fits the video clips during the credits really well. I like that song, it reminds me of something bad and evil...The casting is very good. I especially like the nurse, the ""bad"" guy with the black cap, and Andy, the rooftop shooter!What I don't like about the movie: the scene with the woman giving birth to a zombie-child.

Acting is 1st class and editing is phenomenal. One thing that sticks in my mind RE the plot is how the dorky lead Mall Security cop starts out as a frightened tool, and in the end turns out to be the top hero of the day, making possible the ""escape into the sunset"" of the remainder of the surviving party.......I particularly like that sort of character development......It puts the ""value"" in ""redeeming social value"" that we do so crave in films of this genre!In closing, this is not only a MUST SEE, it is a MUST HAVE IN YOUR DVD COLLECTION!",Dawn of the Dead

VERY good",9,16 February 2005,"Well, I remember renting Dawn of the Dead last year on video after reading some enthusiastic reviews and hearing about other zombie flicks. Well, I borrowed it... and I was blown away. Just like when I borrowed Braindead a few months earlier.Dawn of the Dead is a very good zombie film. The plot is almost identical to the original (which I am currently trying to watch), and it makes for very good viewing. Even more amazing about the film is the fact that it is a DIRECTORIAL DEBUT. How about that?!Well, if you haven't seen it, here is the plot: Something - a virus, possibly; it is never explained - is causing the dead to rise. Not just in a small area, but worldwide. Spreading like wildfire, anybody bitten by one of these things will transform anywhere from a few minutes to a few days later. And these things need to feast on the flesh of the living. A group of survivors, including a nurse, a cop and a pregnant woman (and a guy that sells TV's at Best Buy) take refuge in a massive shopping centre.Well, that's all I am revealing for now.The opening sequence - which is one of the most breathtaking I have ever seen - is slightly more edgy than the rest of the film. But just slightly. Ever so slightly.Some classic moments - the ""flying"" zombie, for instance - are just ingenious. Again, I am not spoiling it.You want a good way to pass a lonely Saturday night?

The zombie make-up effects are just stunning; so gory, realistic...and the techniques they showed in the Director's Cut were fantastic!!!! Seeing this movie on the day it premiered was great. The whole theater was packed and everyone loved it!!! This movie has some really great scenes/lines. One of my favorite lines would have to be Kenneth going ""If I put my foot up your ass, will that be your problem?"". I really enjoyed that although this was a horror movie, there were some comedic elements incorporated within. The actors were just stunning in this. The actors who played the zombies were excellent. I don't even remember the last time I was so scared from watching a movie before going to see this in the theater. The original 1978 version was great as well. Both George Romero and Zack Snyder are phenomenal directors. Another thing I really enjoyed about this film was that the zombies were fast-moving, as opposed to the traditional slow-moving zombies. I really believe Zack Snyder really did the original justice with this remake.",Dawn of the Dead

The big thing was trying to figure out who lives and dies, which always makes for fun. Also, the humor but crisp and fun. After a barrage of killing zombies, our ""humans"" are stuck in an elevator playing, you guessed it, ""elevator music."" The character of CJ breaks us up by saying ""I like this song."" Funny stuff. Sarah Polley was OK, at best. Ving Rhames was great, as was CJ, whoever he is. The ending credits sort of ruined some of it, but not completely. I think it would have been best left out.

725,ericfordh,Cinematic Cotton Candy,7,18 June 2005,"When I first heard ""they"" were redoing ""Dawn of the Dead,"" my heart sank. How could anyone recreate the magic and thrill of the 1978 classic? Well, they didn't ... but the movie was entertaining enough that I have now watched it thrice.The opener really sucks you in. It's creepy, visceral, and glues you to your seat. It's so good, in fact, that those first 5 minutes provide enough juice to carry you through the rest of the movie, no matter how bad the rest might be. Fortunately, the next hour and a half is pretty interesting, too.The directing and photography really help the film; it creates a cold, wet, slippery atmosphere well-suited to the zombie sub-genre. Normally the shaky, documentary-style camera work would be inappropriate for a zombie flick (I find it irritating in almost any movie), but this one is different from other zombie movies in ways that make the technique tolerable.As scary and fun as ""Dawn of the Dead"" is, it lacks something. Maybe there was too much heavy metal in the soundtrack, or maybe the characters did one too many unbelievable things. But I've never just sat back and said ""whoa,"" or had much to say to my friends about the movie. Like cotton candy, it's tasty and you'll probably want it again, but it leaves a funny, unpleasant aftertaste.The new ""Dawn of the Dead"" stands head and shoulders above most Horror films that come out these days. But it hardly clears the original's waistline.",Dawn of the Dead
726,Twisted_T,"Very well done, but one problem............",8,15 October 2005,"Zombies can't run. It took the scariness out of the whole movie. The movie, overall was excellent, but the running zombies distracted me from the real scary parts.I believe that George A Romero (pretty much creator of the zombie genre) would agree with me, the running zombies were a put-down. The reason zombies can't run is because their brain reacts too slowly. Yes, they may be able to run, I mean with healthy joints and muscles, but they don't because it's just something they don't do.The redeeming qualities of this movie were:(spoilers!!! be warned!!!) Great cinematic value. The zombie baby (which I predicted in the first 20 min. of the movie). The ending. The ending was very well done. I loved it. I liked how James Gunn, the writer, had the surviving characters go on a boat (which is mentioned in the original movie, the part with the cops, you know the one) and then the characters get killed. Perfect for this movie.Oh, almost forgot, the whole underlying concept of the original movie was forgotten. Yeah, the story is pretty much the same, but they forgot the moral to the story.

'DAWN OF THE DEAD' So I thought 'what the hell? I have nothing better to do anyway'.. The best part of the movie is definitely the opening where Ana's lover awakes to see the silhouette of the 'undead' Vivian in the doorway, and as she walks closer you can see her ripped and bloodied flesh..that was just creepy..however, the moment was kind of ruined when she started feasting on his neck..not so creepy anymore!

728,featherstondraws,An incredibly average zombie film with the same name as a classic,4,25 August 2016,"It is impossible to evaluate the success of this movie without comparing it to the original. The fantasy element of living in the mall which drove the classic film, of having all the creature comforts of civilization amid the apocalypse, is missing entirely. The social commentary of the original, that consumerism has become so instinctive that even zombies would gravitate towards the mall, is missing entirely. This isn't ""Dawn of the Dead""; this is just a movie that has a mall in it. Also absent are any compelling characters. While the original focused on no more than four survivors, the number is more than tripled in the remake to diminished effect. There are no nuanced portrayals here; the cast never transcends flat character descriptions like ""the tough nurse"", ""the pregnant woman"", or ""the jerk security guard"". As we see them dispatched with the indifference we might reserve for reality show contestants, none of these characters make much of an impression. Original film actor Ken Foret has a brief cameo as a fundamentalist preacher, and in his less than two minutes of screen time he provides a more powerful performance than any of the main cast.The fast zombies are more comedic than scary. Whether they're sprinting after cars like cartoon dogs, bashing their heads through doors, or squealing like pigs as they are picked off by gunfire, the undead never seem to present a credible threat. For all its enhanced budget and updated special effects, this ""Dawn of the Dead"" does not offer anything that cannot be found in the previous four decades of zombie horror. Once again we have to sit through the usual bickering between survivors over who will lead, the standard ""bit by a zombie and waiting to turn"" play for our sympathies, the predictable ill- advised trip to the basement. All this and more has been done before, and executed more effectively.Zack Snyder has always been an amazing visualist, and this is one way in which the film redeems itself. The full scope of a neighborhood descending into chaos is revealed through a camera mounted on an escaping vehicle. Two characters saying a tearful goodbye is broken into multiple cuts from several perspectives, distorting time and drawing us into the moment. The daylight scenes appear overexposed, amplifying the idea that this catastrophe is happening in our real world. Sadly, no amount of skillful cinematography can help this mashup of worn out horror movie banalities.",Dawn of the Dead
729,filmcreator5,Better Then I Initially Thought (Possible Spoilers)!,6,21 February 2006,"When I first saw this movie, I thought it was enjoyable and entertaining, but that it only existed on a superficial level. I believed the sole purpose of this film was to provide an action-packed reformation of the original Dawn of the Dead. Being that I had been a fan of Romero's a year prior to the release of this film, I had the notion that remaking Romero's vision would be hard, if not impossible. Although nothing will equate to the original Dawn of the Dead, this film is not that bad at all. It's just an alternate outlook on a classic zombie film.Zack Snyder's envisioning of such a classic concept prevails. The visuals of this film are stunning. Snyder knew the vision he was trying to create and it simply worked. The film closely follows the theologies of the end times and the Rapture; it achieves a sort of apocalyptical vision. Except instead of Satan, the Anti-Christ and demons... you have zombies. Everyone is trying to protect themselves and their homestead, some with brute force, and they are just trying to cope with this sort of ""Hell on Earth."" This film really does excel visually and retains a sort of nightmarish quality to it. And one aspect of the film I particularly like is the transformation and the stages of the zombies. In the bonus features to this film, Zack Snyder tells us that he created different stages and levels of the ""zombie infection."" I found this idea to be very creative and unique.Good film: 7/10.",Dawn of the Dead

With walking zombies how hard is it to just run from them? But with running zombies you know you're not going to be able to get away without putting up a good fight. The makeup for the zombie's was good also. It made it seem real. None of the two dollar movie make up most ""scary"" movies use. The acting was a little off in some parts, mostly in the beginning.

This is the end of the f****n' world here people, and unlike the original Romero flick this one leaves you with no reassurances. You can't outrun these zombies, you can't hide and eventually they will get you and they will kill you. And then you will become one of them. Zack Snyder has done an incredible job here, and made a horror film truly worthy of the Dawn of the Dead name. Managing to incorporate true scares, action and even humor, he's created a horror classic. And this isn't just the 'cat jumping out of the dark closet' type cheap shock tactics. This is the creeping sick you'll feel for days, even months later, the uneasy feeling that only true horror gives you. Not since the original Exorcist movie has a horror film so affected me.

The only positive things in the movie are two scenes, first and foremost the credits are a joy to watch, and secondly the scene where the girl is thrown into the bath tub, VERY realistic I thought.

737,gammaworm,some just might like it better than the original . . .,8,21 March 2004,"I've really been looking forward to giving this a chance since i heard about it some time last year, and I've got to say that this really wasn't the movie I expected.  It was WAY better!  Zach Snyder has put a fresh spin on an old idea.  It's really impossible not to compare this with its 26 year old predacessor, but that not what I was really interested in.  This is a rethinking of the story.  New characters.  New locations.  New zombies even. In case you haven't heard the zombies run at full speed now.  While I will admit that I wasn't too thrilled to hear that they were messing with a perfect formula, it does work perfectly for THIS movie.  Lets face it, zombies of the old days aren't very scary in this day and age and especially not from a director that had previously only worked on music videos with fast cuts and quicker pacing.  I'm not knocking the guy, its just that with the pacing of this style of movie, I think the fast zombies work much better.  This movie doesn't let up for one moment.The tension never lets up in this film.  Not only was I leaning forward waiting in anticipation for the next scare, but I was also very interested in the survivors.  All the characters were drawn out very well, and you really become interested in what will become of them.  There are plenty of nice situations that arise that are very subtle homages to Romero's classic as well as some of his other films as well.  Without ruining anything, I will say that there are at least 2 character types from each of the original classics.  Long time fans won't be disappointed with the story.The effects were great.  From what I have heard, there were some CG enhanced scenes, but I don't really think anyone noticed.  It seemed that they were using rubber and fake blood for most of it, but some of the gorier scenes had me wondering how they would have done it.  All the effects were very well done.  A movie like this MUST have outstanding effects to stand out. It reminds me of the over the top effects that were prevelent throughout the 80's horror movies, with each new one trying to top the last by killing someone in a creative way.  There were at least a dozen times where you could here the whole audience simultaneously cheer and gasp over a creative scene of gore.Overall, this was a great movie for horror fans and action fans alike.  It won't win an Oscar or anything, but thats not what this kind of movie sets out to do.  You should be going to the theatre to be entertained, and that's exactly what i paid 8 dollars twice to go do.  I always seem to be critical on remakes of classics, but this one is different enough to look at it as a seperate movie all together.  These kinds of movies don't show up very often, and its nice to see one get released with a nice sized budget and get a wide release.  All you purists out there don't worry about this being a crappy remake.  Once the studios see that this knocked ""The Passion of The Christ"" out of the number one spot on its opening week, there will be a whole slew of crappy zombie movies out there to target your rants at.  Enjoy it for what it is and don't trust scuzzy mall security guards!  :D *****",Dawn of the Dead

Compared to the original movie, the remake is, let's say, cooler, not better. The film gets you into the action right away and to be blunt, it is intense. Heads splatter, zombies rise, and babies are born in one of the most bizarre scenes I've ever witnessed in a film. The script is well written for the most part, all up to the end that is. I don't care how cool of a dog that was, if that was me, Chips would be zombie chow. It's a fun remake that replaces the great characters of the original movie with great action.",Dawn of the Dead

740,Arc_J,"Not a terrible film, but different.",8,9 August 2006,"I've been a George A. Romero fan for years now. When I first heard Zack Snyder was remaking Dawn of the Dead back in 2004, I was skeptical but excited. His film disappointed me a bit, but only because I was holding it to the standard George Romero created with his 1978 film. The main thing to remember is: Zack Snyder and George Romero are two different people, and the 1978 and 2004 versions of Dawn of the Dead are two different films.Basically the premise is the same. In fleeing from the zombie-creating plague, a group of people takes refuge in a shopping center.For me, personally, the worst thing about the entire film was the character development -- or lack thereof. In Romero's version, there were four main characters: Peter, Fran, Stephen, and Roger. With a low amount of characters, it's easy for a viewer to relate to them, to learn along with them. In Snyder's version, there are over a dozen: Ana, Michael, Kenneth, Andre, Luda, CJ, Terry, Bart, Norma, Tucker, Frank, Nicole, Monica, Steve, Glen, and Andy. With such a large number of characters, it becomes more difficult for the filmmaker to give any of them significant depth. No one in the movie has any sort of revealed ""past"", except for Ana's, whose past is limited to the first 20 minutes of the film, and Michael, whose past is limited to the few statements he makes in one scene about being a great father and terrible husband. For all it's worth, the greatest showing of any kind of human bonding was between Kenneth and the owner of the gun store across the street, Andy. The director's cut includes a bonus feature which details Andy's last few days -- This lent a comparatively large amount of depth to his character -- But only when compared to the small amount of development the others received.The film DID hold something for fans of zombie flicks -- The zombies. They look better now, owing to the differences in special effects between 1978 and 2004. None of the zombies holds any real significance, however, except for Luda when she turns. Romero's zombies were always more pitied, more sad -- Stuck in that miserable existence. They were still only ""motorized instinct"", but they seemed to have more depth. Maybe it's just me, but depth means a lot to me in a movie, and especially a remake of one of my favorites.Snyder's Dawn is worth watching for fans of zombie films, but don't expect George Romero, because that's not what you get with Snyder.",Dawn of the Dead
741,nastyboy_4202002,"More action, hopelessness, and apocalyptic scenes!",9,30 August 2006,They so need a sequel but this time keep it fast paced. the only problem with dawn of the dead was the scenes i wanted to last were over too quickly. They should have shown more world chaos like NY engulfed in zombies and more scenes of people being attacked in her town. For a sequel the beginning apocalypse should last a good 20 mins as we are given groups of characters we think will live but after the initial zombie breakout it is whiddled down to the movies main characters. Also more scenes of hopelessness the zombies is scary because he is relentless...exploit that.Finally don't slow it down in the middle keep the escape going through the whole movie moving from safe spot to safe spot. the ending did this well but again it was only for a few minutes. I have the first one on DVD and heres to hoping I get to purchase the sequel one day. All in all the best zombie flick I have seen.,Dawn of the Dead

I enjoyed the overall nature of the film from start to finish. *PLEASE NOTE* STAY FOR ENTIRE FILM, WHEN CREDITS COME ON, DO NOT LEAVE, THEY SHOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM ON THE ADVENTURE ON THE ITEM* Don't want to tell the film away but stay until the credits start rolling.In the end, the film was realistic on some points in it and some it wasn't. The film has a view scenes that would make you jump out of your seat and some that were predicted but the film overall, had action, killing and was a great flick. For such a low Budget film at 28 mil, they made a great film (strike) did. It is a must see!! I also heard it ranked in 40 mil + and only cost 28 mil to make, means to me, that alot of people are going to see it and you should to!!",Dawn of the Dead
743,lord_bosco,A let-down,6,3 January 2005,"The original ranks as one of my all-time favorite horror movies. I did enjoy many of the new characters and plot twists. The acting was far superior to the original. Here's my beef: Every now and then, the characters would engage in some utterly absurd action that was clearly contrived to throw suspense into the story. For example, when Michael investigates the noise in the sporting goods store ALONE, without telling anyone else where he's going (and Michael's the smart one!) For me, this just shatters the suspension of disbelief and reminds me that I'm watching a movie -- a movie that isn't even crafted well enough to hide the seams in its plot.I found the entire subplot with Mekhi Phifer's character incredulous. His completely irrational choices are explained away when he suddenly appears to have gone insane. Unfortunately, nothing in the story sets up the mental collapse of this otherwise cool and collected character. His brief conversation with Ving Rhames does nothing to foreshadow a descent into madness. His desire to bring his child into the world and give it a better life than his own hardly sound like the ravings of a lunatic.Oh, and the girl who goes chasing after the dog!!! Oh, puh-leeze!!! I also disliked the epilogue. Why, oh why, would you dock your boat in a potentially hostile shore? Nobody thought to scout the shoreline first? Or drop anchor in the harbor, then take a dinghy to check out the coast? The bleakness of the ending felt fashionably, smugly pessimistic and hateful toward characters I had grown to care for. I do prefer the ending of the original, which is ambiguous but does at least leave room for hope.",Dawn of the Dead

(I can't say. You have to see it for yourself). The actors tried. You watch to see who is going to live and who was going to die, but when it's over you realize you didn't care. It's difficult to make a remake, but in this case I wouldn't had said anything if the director cheated a little and took some ideas from Romero. ""28 days later"" took the thunder out of these zombies and that movie, even though the director denied it, was somewhat of a combination of Romeros' dead movies (watch ""28"" for comparison; it's not 10 times better, just better). The producers threw the equipment and experienced people to surround the new director, but it was a Freshmans' attempt.

It's just as great as 28 years ago, and I have the same creepy feeling again. Not many horror movies can do that to me these days! Luckily the 2004 version has not only improved it's special effects.

The only major complaint I have is that there is a little too much comic relief, but otherwise this is a fine addition to the ""Dead"" world. I hope that it makes mega bucks, so that hopefully George Romero can get the financial backing to make a top-notch fourth and final film in his original series. The special effects and zombies are well done, the quality of acting is far above any found in most zombie films, and it is not overly gory. It will be interesting to see what deleted scenes will be added back in the DVD version of the film. Some purist fans of the original Romero version will probably be full of complaints about this movie, but I say to them ,the original version was not a perfect film by any means either, so give this one a chance, I think it will grow on you.",Dawn of the Dead
751,SiliconJon,The Best Zombie Movie I Have Ever Watched,10,11 November 2006,"I am a fan of zombie movies to begin with, as I find myself engrossed in the very concept itself. While the original was great, this is the kind of remake that shines so brightly with skill and performance at all levels. Improved in this movie are the cinematography, editing, acting, and storyline.Unlike too many (but not all) other zombie flicks, the zombies in this film are relatively agile, and thus pose a believable threat to those who remain un-undead. No brisk walking speed will keep you away from these infected creeps. This aspect alone is a great welcome to the zombie genre, though this film is not the first to implement this feature. This is the first zombie flick I have seen that incorporates a high quality storyline, and attention to detail. Not missed are the plot points that merely occur to fill film space, as events unfold with good cause, and not that ""it just happened"" rubbish that inflicts poorly created film art. Also of great skill are the technical aspects, giving great special effects, superb editing, and a director that kept his eye on the details.If you're not a fan of zombie movies for any reason other than an aversion to gore, then this is a great film for your zombie cherry to be broken. If you are a fan of zombie movies, I would fail to see any reason this film would do anything short of astonish and terrify you.",Dawn of the Dead

I said to myself that I should give this horror film a go because the last time I saw a horror film is a year ago and I had enough of comedies, chick flicks and action films. When I started watching the movie I thought this might be another 'DUMB' horror film where you normally see a girl running towards the back the door instead of the the front door. But then again after a few minutes of watching this movie, I realize that it might be a 'GENIUS' horror film after all. Although some of the actors in the movie are not famous or should we say veteran it's good that their acting abilities are excellent. At the end of the movie, the four or five people and the dog who fled the land and escaped using a boat from the zombies.

The remake of the original Dawn Of The Dead was done splendidly and is very scary. Scenes range from a quiet and calm morning turned chaotic to a dark and forlorn parking garage scene that chills to the bone.The whole movie is an atmosphere of despair and the characters struggle to overcome the fact that life as they know it has ended. There are nay-sayers who state that the movie slows down and is boring in some instances and there may be some weight to that argument but during these times there are essential character developments that take place.New technology allows the zombie scene's to take shape in a graphic and visceral form and the cinematography makes the movie move coherently and solidly. This movie is indeed very addictive and I do own it on DVD. When I watch this movie I can't help but think, what would I do if I was placed in there situation and would I be one of the one's who would journey to the island in hopes of somewhat of a life.All in all zombie-movie fans finally have a new generation movie that uses all the elements of the original version and employs new methods that combined provide a very scary and awesome movie.

Though I have seen better movies about strange mutants and dangerous viruses this one was certainly worth my time. I have seen this movie recently but have watched and enjoyed alike movies before. Films such as the Resident Evil series can easily be compared to Dawn of the Dead.The movie and actors themselves manage to express the human emotions and thoughts at the brink of destruction very well. ""Who to trust and who not"" is an essential thought. Leaving your loved ones for the sake of your own life. It's all about certain decisions we have to make. However there is a lot of pain and misery, you will for sure not miss the several funny scenes spread over the movie.One point of critic I have to make is the sometimes what awkward scenes that come out of nowhere. For instance, I did expect certain elements as nudity to stay away. Also did I not enjoy the movie as a horror movie at all, it had way more thrill than horror.So if you have a night free and want to enjoy a good movie?

757,johnsigwald,"Why I gave Dawn a 10 (well, maybe it should have been a9).",10,20 March 2004,"I've been to thousands of movies in my lifetime and own hundreds of videos and DVDs, so I am a fan but not a bona fide film critic.  This is my first online review.My wife and I saw the original Dawn of the Dead 25 years ago at a midnight show and left wired enough to talk each other down till the morning. Perhaps a quarter of a century has inured us to the violence a bit since we just watched it again (rental video) last week prior to yesterday's venture to the local multiplex to see the remake/""reimagining"" and were mostly unperturbed by the revisit.For some reason, I was hooked on the new Dawn months ago from the teaser and, subsequently, the actual trailer.  The Sparklehorse song in the former fit perfectly and the suburban shot followed by killer Vivian and closing with the burned projector film of the latter was intriguing in its own way. So I was primed to see the movie, usually a recipe for disaster since preview expectations are rarely fulfilled by the finished product.  This time, however, they were.The cast was uniformly believable and, more important, empathizable (at least with the good guys who got sorted out along the way).  Even the playboy jerk had several relevant lines.  Polley was a good, strong female lead (with another great rebuttal -- ""No, I'm a * nurse"" to a query about her medical skills) and Rhames a cheerable, if reluctant, hero.  The camaraderie, such as it was, worked, and visceral me-first survival gave way more often to self-sacrifice.So, what's not to like?  The fundamental premise that a classic got remade? Doesn't wash.  These are two different movies with the same name and similar premises but very different attitudes.  (Better special effects didn't hurt, either, although this new version was oddly less disturbing sans zombies munching on dismembered body parts.)  Speedy zombies (except for the ""twitchers"")?  No problem; hey, they're hungry and, as always, persistent. My attention was held for the better part of two hours; the story was interesting; the outcome ambivalent; the characters arisen to the task at hand, becoming coldly rational to the divisions between life and death and zombiedom; the music weirdly appropriate; the black humor welcome respite. No, Dawn of the Dead isn't Citizen Kane nor is it a sacrilegious assault on the horror genre.  It's solid filmmaking that's entertaining and thought-provoking.  Otherwise, I suspect Romero would never have put his imprimatur on the remake.",Dawn of the Dead

What an EXCELLENT thrill-ride of a movie this is.  It seems that 28 Days Later had more of an influence on this film than the original did.  It looks to have been shot on Digital Cameras too; the picture had that same look about it.At first, I was disappointed that the Zombies were not the usual slow moving lumps of dead flesh that I knew and loved......that quality alone seemed to make them even more menacing in the Romero classics (of which I am a MASSIVE fan, by the way).  It didn't take long, tho, to accept the new look Zombies......again, probably helped by the effectiveness of the assailants in 28 Days Later (as they were obviously not Zombies in that film).......and this only added to the whole 'edge of the seat' action/horror of the movie. And as for 'jumping out of your skin' !!!   There are a few moments where I physically left my seat, I jumped so hard.The special effects are obviously a little more advanced than in the original....not to take any credit away from Tom Savini, who worked wonders in the original.....and some head shooting and chainsaw scenes were some of the most bloodthirsty I have seen in a long while.There are some really funny moments in this movie too.  Look out for the 'Celebrity Zombie' shoot-out  in particular....and also the fantastic parody of the 'chainsaw, blood-spurting in face scene' lifted from The Evil Dead 2. The guy that plays this scene has more than a passing resemblance to Mr Bruce Campbell.  I did get a little worried about the developing pregnancy sub-plot......was half expecting something not unlike the film 'It's Alive' about the killer baby.  Luckily, it wasn't too bad.  Fans of the Zombie genre may also spot the obvious references to the Lucio Fulchi movie ""Zombi 2"" or ""Zombie Flesheaters"", as I think it was called in the US.....tho wait for the closing credits.....whatever you do, DO NOT leave until the film absolutely ends !Also look out for cameos from at least two of the Stars from the original film;  Tom Savini as a straight talking Cop, eager to dispatch the Zombies as efficiently as possible.....and Ken Foree, who utters the infamous phrase that was the Tagline to the original.......'

760,dwtomek,"Thanks, Gunn",10,20 March 2004,"I just saw this movie tonight, and in my opinion, is the best horror movie I have seen in 10 years. The acting from all involved seemed appropriate. The timing in the movie was excellent. It started out with some tense moments in a hospital then moved straight to a pretty intense, fast moving introduction until they got to the mall. Then the action kept up almost to the point where I would have been ready for it to stop, but then it started focusing more on the interactions of a very diverse crowd in a very stressful situation. This went on long enough until I was ready to be scared again, and they pulled it off. Admittedly you have to let yourself be scared by this movie, but if you are like me, you watch these movies just hoping that there will be more than one time that you at least jump a little, and they pulled that off for me. There was also some nice humor scattered throughout, some truly disturbing moments, just an experience overall. Anyway, this might not be as good as the original (I finally found a place to rent it, will watch that this week), but considering that they did not rely soley on special effects and gore to scare you (in fact, they didnt try at all, there was good use of moments where you expect something but you just arent entirely sure what). I'd say this is the best attempt at a horror movie since the 70's. Somebody here really had a grasp at what horror is really about and I'm glad.",Dawn of the Dead

Shoot them in the head and they die.  The few survivors take refuge in a mall.The differences are the speed of the zombies.  The origional had them walk slowly towards you which, in my opinion, makes it more suspenseful and makes the zombies look more ... well dead I guess you can say.  The fast moving zombies in this version is exciting as well but just gives it a very different feel.  More of an adrenaline rush then a scared feeling.  There is no biker gang in this one which was a really nice touch in the first.  And in this movie seemed more of a stand-alone film while the original was obviously a sequel where everyone knew about the zombies from the beginning, again in my opinion was a little better since we already know what the zombie problem is about.Some of the things I found to be kind of stupid in this movie (and there are only a few) is when ***SPOILER ALERT*** Nicole (the young girl in the movie) went out in a truck to save the dog.  And she actually made it. Give me a break...  If it was that easy to get food to the guy in the other building they should have done so earlier... Another thing is the way they hooked up the trucks... reminded me too much of the old show the A-Team... and why did they put bobwire on the tops of the trucks... they are zombies who do not feel pain.  Why put them on there. Also there were many zombies in the parking garage where the trucks were? And lastly... I wish we got to know the characters better... they all seemed a little flat.... and they should have shown Mekhi's character going a little nuts to explain better why he acted the way he did.....  other then these few things I thought this move was perfect...Hopefully this helps some.  I think everyone who loves horror, action and black humor would enjoy this film.  Hopefully this movie will pave the way for more zombie movies and may have George Romero make a fourth installment to his living dead movies.",Dawn of the Dead
763,twin-zeniths,Absolutely fantastic Film,9,24 December 2012,"Quite simply one of my favourite films of all time.I loved the nightmarish quality of the original 1978 sequel. This is different with far more action, faster pace, bigger budget and lets face it, far better acting. The opening sequence is so well done and utterly shocking. The title sequence is inspired and has spawned many copies since. The quality of the casting, sets and makeup could not be bettered.If you haven't seen it, you must! I would have loved a remake of the Day of the Dead to this level of quality.I saw this twice at the cinema and many times since on DVD.",Dawn of the Dead

And for the first time in ages, a perfectly timed movie length-wise!! [not too long, not too short]And how much scarier are zombies when they run at full pace?Dare I say it.... Better than the original?Alright if I was gonna nitpick anything - it would be why couldn't the many thousands of zombies break the mall windows? But I hate nitpickers so I won't let that get in the way of my rating.OK before the purists eat my brains let me put it this way.Not as clever as the original but definitely more entertaining.*****",Dawn of the Dead
765,spiltblood,Do yourself a favor a watch the original,3,16 January 2006,"This movie was a horrible remake of what in my mind is a classic movie. I have watched the original so many times it's probably unhealthy. Every Halloween I bust it out while I'm carving my pumpkins, sad I know but it gets me into the mood I guess. I'd have to say that the best portion of the movie was the credits. Not because it meant the movie was over, although that was a good thing, but the zombies you get to see by this point actually looked half decent. As for the rest of the zombies in the movie they look pathetic. Most of them look like they were out of some 'straight to video' piece of crap from the early 80s. And what was with their eyes going metallic looking?!? The biggest problem with this movie, aside from boring stereotypical characters who you can easily predict when they will die, is that the zombies seemed based on the ones in ""28 days later"". Which really aren't zombies after all. Dawn of the Dead, like the rest of the series, should be about ZOMBIES. So they shouldn't all look like they just woke up from an all night drink fest and be able to run like marathon athletes. They should be lumbering, nasty looking, mindless creatures that are truly dangerous by their sheer number. Not because they can outrun most people up a flight of stairs.It was a true challenge not to walk away from this one.",Dawn of the Dead

767,Hero_Boy,Just to verify some things,10,22 March 2004,"First of all, despite popular belief, rigomortis (pardon my spelling) sets in after hours of being dead. Dead bodies turn to zombies in a matter of minutes or even seconds. Rigomortis can be stopped in a dead body by simply excersizing the muscles, breaking up the rigomortis. So it makes sense that a dead body WOULD actually be able to run, jump, swim and skate normally if they wanted to. Second of all, the idea of ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead shall walk the Earth,"" is just a theory of what is going on. That COULD be a possibility, but there are many others. Notice that when a person is bitten they are poisoned by the bite and die and are reanimated. (The next sentence could be a spoiler!) Yet, when Ving Rhames' character probably gets blood in his cut, he lives. Perhaps this disease or epidemic is infectuos only through the zombie's saliva, or maybe a bacteria in their mouths. There was also talks of ""If this was a disease then how'd it infect the whole world in one night?"" Try and think for yourself on this one. Maybe terrorist organizations created a man made super virus and set it off in every major country. Who knows? All in all this movie was simply put AMAZING. In my opinion it is even a better movie than the original. It seems to capture more of an apocolyptic feel to it. I'm buying the limited special collector's edition if there ever is one.",Dawn of the Dead
768,imawesome-976-667091,Zack Snyder Does It Again,8,22 July 2011,"!SPOILERS AHEAD! Let me just start by saying, I'm a huge fan of Zack's Movies (No, Not That God Awful Owl Movie Abortion) I'm talking about Watchmen. Now as far as Dawn Of The Dead goes, this just shows how good Zack is with interpreting an idea that has been done and transferring it to modern cinema. Now I am very respectful to the old Dawn Of The Dead, however cheesy it may be to most movie goers now, it still made a huge dent in the horror movie crowd introducing a group of people under siege by zombies in a new surrounding. This movie does a great job enforcing that idea into a modern time. The cast could not have been more well chosen. The old film's image is still upheld in a new environment with great prestige. The only reason I didn't give it a ten is because, come on, its a zombie flick! You like zombies, this is a must see!",Dawn of the Dead
769,The_Jewish_Menace,This movie while not as good as the original...it's damn good,9,27 March 2004,"This movie totally exceeded my expectations.I loved the original by George Romero and was hoping that they wouldn't trash this movie.I work at a theatre so I went to see it at an employee sneak peek and I tell you what.When the end came...the real one after the end credits...I was really happy that the new generation of directors and hollywood didn't screw what I consider to be the premeir zombie film.Now the new one is not much similar to the old one minus the fact that it takes place for a majority inside a shopping mall...but these new elements that the director brought in made it great.First of all I have never been a fan of fast zombies but in this film they pulled it off great.This movie would've not been nearly as good if they hadn't had a fast zombie to fight with.The action in this movie is great.There is alot of action in it and they have just enough to keep it in the horror genre.Everything was done really well in this movie...now on to the bad stuff...The movie had too many characters.It wasn't that they were bad but you didn't really need that many people...it took away from that ""we're all alone"" feeling.Next on the list...exposition...I wanted there to be more of a background...how did this start...where did it originate from...but the plot throughout the film was really well done.But i tell you it would've been alot better with maybe 15 more minutes in the film for exposition.Another element while appreciated that I didn't like was the comedy.You have to have a little bit but they tried to turn plenty of it into a comedy...too many one liners.Overall I give this film a B+ on an all movie scale and an A on the horror scale.It was a great horror film and a good movie all around.I recommend this to Dawn of the Dead fans as well as new comers to the genre.",Dawn of the Dead

772,kwokinator,"Great zombie movie, modern-style",9,20 March 2004,"This movie met all my expectations and more.  From the trailer I know it's a movie with fast zombies instead of the slow ones from the original.  That alone hooks me and draws me to the movie; I've never been able to get into the old ""Dead"" movies Romero did.  I mean, come on, the zombies are so slow you can run circles around them.  How scary is THAT?I never watched the original Dawn of the Dead (only saw Night and Day), but I liked what I see here.  Right of the bat, the action takes off 5 minutes into the movie.  This movie isn't about panic, it's pure adrenaline packed into an hour and a half.  The action is fast-paced and relentless, helped by the zombies that can probably run faster than you can.And I just loved some of the irony in this movie, in moments it's deeper than most horror movies.",Dawn of the Dead
773,Geister_22,Give me a break...,1,21 March 2004,"I just saw Dawn of the Dead and all I have to say is, GIVE ME A BREAK! The movie begins with some ""unknown"" virus that reanimates the dead who are infected, fine that makes for an interesting Zombie movie.  This epidemic is apparently world wide, although the cause is never actually revealed. They continually make reference to the armed forces and how they are trying to contain these creatures.  The United States military was subdued and virtually annihilated in one days' time.  You learn in the movie that ""Fort Pastor"", the army base near this city, is destroyed and is a ""blood bath"". In other words the United States Military armed with armored tanks, Assault Rifles, and Air Support, is less suited to the task of fighting these creatures then 6 average joes wielding pistols and shotguns.  Oh yea...and let's leave the safety of the mall to drive to some Island out in the middle of no where.  This movie takes place in Milwaukee?  Apparently there are tropical Islands out on Lake Michigan now...and how exactly did those creatures get to that Island or infect it?  Weren't they supposed to be mechanically illiterate? So boats are ruled out? and they cannot swim....This movie is littered with holes, save your money!",Dawn of the Dead
774,swhitley2000,More of a nod than a remake *minor spoilers*,8,20 March 2004,"As the summary reads, this is more of a nod to the original Dawn than a true remake.  True, the premise is the same but that's really where it ends. First off, the cast is much larger than the original so by sheer numbers alone, there isn't as much attention given to detailed character exploration as some would like.  More due to the performances of the leading actors than the script, I did find myself caring about some of the people in this movie. A lot of the characters are one dimensional and even those fleshed out a bit are more broad sketches than multi-layered personalities.  This really isn't a complaint because, for better or worse, this is a horror film and my expectations for such a thing in this genre have been lowered to the point thru years of viewing bad films that a little bit can go a long way in this type of film.   Second, the journey to get to the mall is much faster than the original.  I didn't feel it was necessary for the characters in this version to get there any later than they did because it would have really slowed the movie down.  There isn't the sense of impending dread in the remake like there is in the original; this film simply moves at a different pace.  Not really better or worse, just different.  In fact, that can be said for the movie as a whole.  It's not the original Dawn.  They simply can't remake that film for many reasons, not the least of which is the social commentary in the original wouldn't seem particularly relevant to today's audience.Now on to the review of the movie itself.  I have very few complaints with the remake.  I felt that segments were unintentionally funny, especially with Mekhi Phifer's (who really did deserve a better forum to showcase his skills than the tired subplot he was saddled with) character Andre.  I also felt there could've been more background given on Michael (Jake Weber). There seemed to be hints given about him through out that I'm not entirely certain were born more from the screenplay or the actor's performance. Also, the romantic chemistry between he and Ana (Sarah Polley) was sadly lacking.Now on to what I thought worked.  Ok...I'll admit it: I liked the zombies. I've read some comparisons to 28 Days Later in the other comments which I do agree with due to timing more than anything else.  The concept of zombies that don't stumble and stagger isn't really a new one, though.  There's an Italian zombie film that features such beasties (the title escapes me). And, in all honesty, 28 Days Later did lift a bit from Day Of The Dead in the last 45 minutes or so...  The opening to this film is great.  I feel that it goes about showing the utter chaos of the situation in a more jarring fashion than the original.  I realize I'm jumping on the band wagon here, but Ving Rhames is just awesome in this movie.   This is a bit random, but I couldn't help but be reminded of Lucio Fulci's Zombie during the end credits...I'd give this movie 6 1/2 out of 10 stars.  It's not great, but it's wildly entertaining.  It's not the original Dawn, either.  I think if one walks in expecting a straight retread of the original than they'll be disappointed. If it's taken as a different film with the same premise, then I think that it stand on it's own.",Dawn of the Dead
775,scubadawg91,Not as thoughtful as the original,8,20 March 2004,"SPOILERS!First off, I really liked this movie.  It lacked the expected 10 or so minutes of extreme gore (""feastings"") that is in evidence in all the Romero films, and I think it was better for it.I did see a couple of inconsistencies and they always gnaw at me (no pun intended!).  At the end, as they leave the marina on the sailboat, you can see an island off in the distance.  Anyone with a sense of geography for Lake Michigan and the Milwaukee area should know there are NO islands there (you'd have to travel some distance up the coast to find some, and they're certainly not visible from anywhere near there).Lastly, as the owner of a 28' sailboat myself, there were a couple things I thought weren't particularly realistic.  First, the size of sailboat (I'm estimating 35'-40') should have a fuel tank of 30-35 gallons.  Half a tank of diesel (sailboats burn fuel VERY slowly) would give a range of 100+ miles.  Secondly, it is a SAILBOAT.  Being out of fuel isn't the end of the line....  Also, boats that size have dingies.Finally, I believe they were looking for an ""unihabited"" island.  There are a few small population islands further north (Mackinaw Island comes to mind) that would be a better destination and would require some ""work"" (killing of zombies) to clear but would be a good long-term home....Just my thoughts, but I welcome your thoughts/comments!",Dawn of the Dead
776,ouunknowngirl,"Some good twists, but overall a disappointment as a remake",6,20 March 2004,"If you can forget this is a remake, it's not bad for an ""escape"" movie. It's got enough gore and action to keep you entertained, but for a moderate stretch in the middle where not much happens.  The opening sequence is absolutely terrifying, and pulled me right in with it's chaotic apocalyptic nightmare.  Once the characters get to the ""mall,"" however, things slow down to a pace that makes me a little bored.The audience is never made to feel like the zombies outside are a real threat to the living in the mall.  The atmosphere is not bleak-- rather, you can almost forget about what's happening outside as the characters have fun inside the mall.  There's even comic relief (there were no comic moments in the original; it was completely dark).  I suppose this part of the movie was supposed to be about character development, but the movie even fails at that.  Most of the character development is shallow, stereotypical, and it is difficult to understand the motivations behind some of the characters' actions.While it may seem like I hated the movie, the last thirty minutes or more are edge-of-your-seat thrilling, so the payoff is good.  As far as comparing this movie with the original, I would definitely call this movie a disappointment.  It's too flashy!  There is slick heavy metal music, blatant product placement, comedy, and cheap attempts to make you feel emotional without anything deep or philosophical under it.  The original made you feel as if something terrible had happened to humanity.  This film only makes you feel as if something terrible has happened to the characters in the film, most of which you could care less about.",Dawn of the Dead
777,allanhc,Great remake,10,20 March 2004,"As a fan of the original Romero films and the genre in general, I was somewhat apprehensive to see what this film would do with the material. Fortunately, the result was an onslaught of gore, awesome looking modern-day `fast' zombies, well honed homage to the past, and snippets of originality from the writer/director that make this a truly excellent addition to the zombie film collection!  While House of the Dead (last year) had its good moments (and its bad as well), Dawn exhibited quality filmmaking all the way through.  I really enjoyed the energy, visual effects (gore) and cinematography, and the characters in this movie.  So many horror movies these days forget that characters are as important as the rest of the action.  Not here.  If you are a zombie fan, and you enjoyed 28 Days and/or the original Living Dead movies, you really should see this movie on the big screen.  There are some really great suspense sconces that we could never have imagined back in the 1970s.   Enjoy!",Dawn of the Dead

I recently got the directors cut on Blu Ray and have watched it over 5 times!Watch the closing credits all the way to the end, you have to! I didn't the first time and missed some good scenes!

779,zombielover,Zombies attack the living!!!,8,23 March 2004,"Overall the movie was actually pretty good.  I loved the original and was excited to see the remake but feared that it would be a disappointment. It was evident that in addition to the large cast there were several other changes that were going to be made.  However, I was pleased with the outcome although it could have had more suspense.  There were a few flaws but I expected that.  After seeing the movie I was glad that the remake made several changes.  Dawn of the Dead (1978) is a classic horror movie, especially for that day in time.  It can not be duplicated.  Besides when classic horror pictures are redone and try too hard to be faithful to the original (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho, Night of the Living Dead), they suck.  I give it an 8 out of 10.",Dawn of the Dead
780,badbhoy,Pleasantly Surprised!,8,20 March 2004,"First off, I've been a fan of the original for years and I was extremely skeptical on what a remake would be able to achieve considering the source material.  That being said, James Gunn and Zack Snyder have put together not only one of the best remakes of any film I have seen in years, but a true classic within the zombie genre itself.  Is it as good as the original? It's hard for me to consider that since one of the things I love about the 1979 version is that it's so...well 1979!  I couldn't expect a 2004 version to include a ultra low-budget effects department, Goblin soundtrack,  and the Brown Derby Luv Pub.  This version definitely has some elements of the Scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer generation of horror film-making, but for the most part it improves the movie rather than turning it into another post-1990 crapfest.  There are enough sly nods to the original to demonstrate that Snyder is a fan of the cult classic, but he still makes sure to  let the audience know that this his own masterpiece right from the opening scene.  Most importantly, the film doesn't cop-out like last years 28 Days Later did. Snyder thankfully realizes that a movie about the apocalypse should stay true to it's theme from beginning to end. There are still a couple of minor flaws. The film does unfortunately shy away from the original's underlying message about consumerism, but that would be difficult to pull off in any film in 2004 since the film industry is now such integral part of that anyway.   I also would have loved to hear the hilarious mall muzak that played during the 1979 version's closing credits, but Jim Carroll's People Who Died and Johnny Cash's Man Comes Around are fantastic replacements.In the end, Dawn of the Dead 2004 is not only a film that should satisfy purists of the original classic, but also a refreshing revisit to the zombie genre that will hopefully inspire other filmmakers to do the same.8/10",Dawn of the Dead
781,reb_lan,"Gore galore, with witty humor and an interesting soundtrack",10,21 March 2004,"(Warning, some spoilers ahead) Starting off, I have not seen the original ""Dawn of the Dead"", but i have read about it.  I must say that after watching this version it makes me wanna see the original. Let me say this, however, i think this movie should be judged on it's own, not compared to the original in every detail. The movie starts off with no credits, the first ten minutes show the main character(Sarah Polley) going through her normal routine of being a nurse, getting home late from work and chatting with a little neighbor girl, and the going inside and talking with her husband. Let me just say they get a little romantic in the shower.  The next morning the husband wakes up and sees the same little neighbor girl at the bedroom door. The boy approaches the little girl and gets bitten on the neck and goes after his wife, who narrowly escapes through the bathroom window and drives away through the neighborhood seeing all the chaos and gore going on.  Then the credits start playing with Johnny Cash's The Man Comes Around Playing in the background.The rest of the movie deals with the nurse meeting up with several other survivors who seek refuge in a shopping mall and then eventually make a plan to make it to the marina and get a boat to escape to an island.  I won't mention anything about the escape, except that it involves armored buses and chainsaws.This movie is not really scary, it is however very gory.  The zombies are really terrified looking (especially the little girl).  The special effects are solid, mainly because they are not overused and nothing in this movie is too over-the-top or fake.The acting in this movie is about average, but you don't need Jack Nicholson or Russell Crowe playing main points for this movie to be a success.  The actors do their job in this movie, which is to move the story along and not overact and screw everything up. The best acting in this movie belongs to Jake Webber, who plays an everyday guy named Michael who is just trying to help as many people as he can while still saving his own skin.  He is the only character that you care about and you want him to live.The most intriguing thing about this movie is the soundtrack. The Johnny Cash song during the credits, the Air Supply song, ""I'm All Out of Love"" playing in the elevator as they make their escape. The best part of the movie for me was the montage showing what all the character's in the mall were doing to pass the time.  During this, the song ""Down with the Sickness"" is being sang and played with an acoustic guitar, which, to anybody who knows who the band Disturbed is, it will make you laugh or at least smile.The way to sum up this movie is to say, it's very enjoyable and very interesting.  It really doesn't fit into any movie category, except maybe future classic.  ""Dawn of the Dead"" has just as many humorous moments as it does terrifying, but that is what makes it enjoyable.  The only problem i had with the movie is the sudden ending, but that works well, i just didn't want it to end.  Director Zack Snyder has done something special, and i look forward to his future productions. I give this movie 9.5/10",Dawn of the Dead

The energy of the movie is quite extreme as is the action. It is a miracle how this major passed German censorship, they are usually quite fast to turn down violence, but none of it here. I liked everything about this movie, especially the movie's credits and the fast running zombies, or the ending. I think the gory content is extreme for a major movie.

784,christopherturco,Welcome to the End,9,20 March 2004,"""Dawn of the Dead,"" remake of the original 1979 film, delivers on all fronts.  It starts with a bang, submitting us to some very scary and disturbing imagery (my favorite being the bus window scene).  ""Dawn of the Dead"" continues the trend of updating the zombie for our time.  Back when ""Night of the Living Dead"" came out, it was supposedly a parable for communist paranoia - they could be anyone, anywhere, even our neighbors, and they're OUT TO GET US! The slow, encroaching threat of the red nation... ""28 Days Later"" showed us zombies that were based somewhat on modern tempers going to hell.  Air rage? road rage? consumer rage? There's a reason the virus was called ""RAGE.""  A metaphor for how seemingly decent people becoming virtually feral at the drop of a hat in our society - I see this up close every day, so that hit home with me. Here, the zombies take a note from 28 D-L and are faster, smarter and more vicious than any movie before.  Their speed and violence is also a perfect metaphor for terrorism in our age - it comes so suddenly, with such an amazing cost to humanity, and it seems that we just can't stop it no matter what we do.  It's everywhere we go, and it's not going to go out without taking a few of us with it. The writing of the movie is tight and pulls no punches.  This is a horror movie in the TRADITIONAL sense.  Forget that teen-level garbage with a bunch of nubile high schoolers being chased by some idiot in a mask.  This is a callback to when horror movies were written for an adult audience, and they're not out to be gentle or provide tongue in cheek humor.  They go for the jugular and they don't stop until they're holding half of your throat. This is an excellent, excellent movie, one that was well crafted, well acted and genuinely scary.  Intense and frightening in every sense of those words.  If it suffers from anything, it's a slight lack of character development, but they got more development in than I was expecting. 9 out of 10.  Twenty-first century horror has arrived, and it's not for your kids anymore.",Dawn of the Dead
785,lcolas22,Great Movie in its own right!,9,22 March 2004,"Ok, I though they played this one perfectly!  When is a remake not a remake: When it is completely re written from scratch.  The mall was a plot device used to give fans from the first movie a familiar ""place to call home"" Other than that it is not the main focus of the movie as in the first one. Next you may tout Romero and put the 1st version on a pedestal but, Romero did a great job with the budget he had.  the first was campy and the zombies shuffled around slowly but hey it worked!  In this movie as in all of the ""DEAD"" movies there is never explanation given as to why it happens it just does!  Even with the better makeup and increased action the Dead aren't the focus as much as the interplay between the characters and their isolation.My main issues are with the credit scenes.  They sail off... to where? they are in Wisconsin the clips make it look like they are out of water so; last I checked they couldn't be at sea! The fuel thing was ridiculous they are in a sailboat. And why couldn't they fish for food?  Eventually the DEAD would decompose and slowdown.  And why in the remake of Night were the dead fighting over a rat but they don't eat dog?",Dawn of the Dead
786,Nepacha,pleasing disgust,7,19 October 2004,"This is really some pleasing disgust. I have the original dead trilogy and dawn is my favorite of the three. Non the less i think this is a brilliant remake If I've ever seen one. It has all the morbid tension and sick feel of the first film. It also manages to add a few personal touches which makes it both original and even more scary then the first one. I love it!! I would love for more directors to do what Zhan have done for this one. I see nothing wrong in a good remake, especially if it steps away from the original and creates something new and better as this one does. Then again you don't really have to compare the two. The original have many things in it that this one can never live up to since that production is of a totally different nature.",Dawn of the Dead

it is a good movie. also the little girl in the beggining is not the daughter of sarah polley, it is the nieghbor.  so therefore they would not have heard the screams.Spoiler----- When the are inthe gun store, how do they get out cause they just sorta appear ouitside all of a sudden. that is the only thing that bothered me.

788,atomicacore,Unoriginality at its peak.,1,19 March 2004,"I just got back from seeing this film, and I am so revolted by it. I've been a big fan of zombie flicks from the past, especially the romero and fulci flicks and this movie just saddens me. All I could think was rip off of 28 days later, and ruining of the original dawn of the dead. Heck, the movie starts in a hospital, leads into a dramatic loneliness seen, then the alarm clock imagery followed up by riot footage and a red on black title sequence so similar to 28 days later - oh and not to mention they sped up the film half way through, and of course magically all the zombies were fast paced atheletes - even a bloated obese woman, it made me feel bad knowing this movie was made in a america with a much more bloated budget than that of 28 days later, a movie that I feel made some steps forward in a genre that hasn't hardly been improved on since the early 80s. This movie also consists of a ton of plot holes and loose ends. Ridiculous. Absolutely. Now the group of friends I saw it with said it was OK as a gore film, but being a zombie fan and recognizing whats been done and why made this movie falter so badly. There's a million one-liners, some funny scares, a couple tributes to the classics (cameo by savini, head zombie, baby zombie, etc.), but it doesn't really do them any justice with the film as a whole. I say, if you're a zombie movie fan and you don't want to waste the eight bucks I just wasted, wait for it to come out on video, maybe there'll be a good movie in the special features on the dvd, who knows. But yeah, terribly unoriginal, and arrogant.",Dawn of the Dead
789,jwrethamel,Unexpectedly Great,10,21 March 2006,"Since seeing the original Dawn Of The Dead as a teen back in 1992, I was definitely pumped about seeing the new DOTD as soon as it came out. Of course, ""remake"" is basically the kiss of death when it comes to getting fair and unbiased reviews before the movie comes out, especially when such a genre-defining film such as DOTD is remade. So I hoped against hope that my dreams of seeing a modernized DOTD that was worth seeing would materialize. Did it ever!! I entered the theater on March 21, 2004 (by myself as my girlfriend would have nothing to do with it) with great anticipation. Strangely enough, I was one of maybe a dozen or so people in the theater (which makes sense as I went about 2:30pm on a weekday) and got comfortable. The first ten minutes was among the scariest and best openings of a movie that I have ever seen. It was simply a rush to see the world go completely insane so quickly. The opening theme song (""The Man Comes Around"" by the late, great Johnny Cash) was perfect in setting the mood of hopelessness. For me, the tension and the action did not let up until the end credits (and if you've seen this movie, there is still plenty going on during the credits as well). The fast-moving zombies and the sheer numbers of them, especially during the end ""escape"" really was great, too. I was also pleased that this film did not resort to the now Hollywood-cliché of computer-generated every thing. There are some (not many) spots where CG was used (most notably during the escape where there appears to be about 100,000 zombies in the mall parking lot attacking the shuttle buses. About my only complaint is that I wish there was more of a lead-in (as well as action) of getting into the mall as there was in the 1978 original. However, I came away very satisfied and hoping for a sequel to this fine horror film.",Dawn of the Dead
790,thanewsource,great horror movie that should please die-hard Romero fans and inspire new ones,9,9 March 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS, I DONT THINK THEY ARE BUT SOME OF YOU MIGHT, THEY ARE VERY VAGUE THO........i saw the movie last night at an advanced screening in manhattan, and all of my expectations were definitely met. i loved it, and every1 in the audience started clapping and cheering when it ended, something i havent seen happen in a long time. (do not leave right when the movie ends, zack snyder and company give us a little bonus footage during the end credits, a pretty creative and cool feature of the movie.) this was easily the most fun i've had watching a movie in a long time (besides Kill Bill). i have been a die-hard fan of the Romero Dead trilogy since i was like 10 years old, and i'm now 22 so thats 12 years of zombie support. like many others, i was a little nervous when i heard about this remake, but rest assured they nailed it and have made a great update that brings the story into 2004, embraces the fast-paced nature of modern horror, but also delivers a mood of nostalgia and uniqueness courtesy to zack snyder's creative directing skills. the only similarities between this and the original is the basic plot: survivors of the zombie plague take refuge in a mall and must learn to adapt within themselves and stay alive. other than that, this version takes the plot in many new directions, all effective and commendable. while there isnt the underlying consumerism theme or as much in-depth character studies as the original, the makers of this version wisely decided to focus more on the survival aspects, leaving the magic of the original alone. there are many likeable characters, especially those played by jake weber, ving rhames and mekhi phifer, all three give great performances and really bring you into their respective worlds of pain. ty burrell and michael kelly are also effective, adding enjoyable moments of comic relief that sparked big laughs from the audience i was with. sarah polley has a nice ""girl-next door"" appeal that makes her character very real. the rest of the characters are a bit thin, and you don't really get to know them much, but i expected this being that there are 15 people hiding in the mall and the film is an hour and 35 minutes. some of the best moments in character study included Kenneth's relationship with Andy in the gun shop across the way, Andre's desire to start a family and give his future child everything he didnt, and the zombie/ celebrity look-a-like shootings. please believe, there are plenty of zombie head gun shots, and the level of blood and gore is rather high for a hollywood movie. not as much flesh-eating as the original, but there are a few key money shots that cannibal hounds will enjoy (including a nice open stomach shot with a zombie feasting on insides). those looking for a lot of zombie action will be extremely happy, and the amount of zombies is crazy. very little CGI effects are used, and when they are, (like an aerial car crash shot and several zombies being ran over by a truck) they are done very well and do not look too fake. this was the most fun i've had at the movies in a long time, and i will definitely support and pay for this movie numerous times when it opens.(another cool thing was that when tom savini, ken foree and scott reiniger made their cool cameos, several people in the audience clapped and applauded, showing that many true Dead fans were in the building.) Zack Snyder has done an exceptional job for his first film, and he shoots each zombie attack very clearly, without the dizzying camera shots or quick editing found in 28 Days Later. he should definitely be commended, and the film makers should too for several small tributes to the original (like Gaylen Ross store and when the character Bart replies to Tom Savini's sheriffs comments by saying ""see, that is a cool guy, he knows what we need to do"" or something along those lines). this is the best horror movie to come out in many years, as it embraces its horror and doesnt insult the audiences intelligence at all. this film has many memorable moments and should stand alone nex to the original proudly, as long as original Dawn fans realize that this is a completely different approach to the story. the zombies found here are pretty scary, armed with great make-up and intense as hell, making for edge-of-your seat action sequences (such as the rescue of Nicole in the gun shop, the the sewer chase and the Arks drive thru the zombie-infested parking lot.) (how CJ makes their commute thru the lot easier is a really cool scene and received applause from the audience.) bottom line is this: zack snyder and universal pictures should be highly applauded for what they have done here, making an amazing zombie movie for 2004 that should go down as a zombie classic. old-school zombie fans should be very pleased, and new-school moviegoers should gain a nice liking for true zombie horror. make sure every1 runs to the theatre on march 19 and sees this movie, i promise you wont be disappointed at all. job very well done.",Dawn of the Dead

At times hilarious, but never campy, this truly scary movie is the most ""human"" ZOMBIE film I've ever seen. The characters are written with true depth and it really says a lot that this movie attracted truly top notch actors. Everything, even down to the music selection, was incredible. The tone of the movie was perfect. The way everyone worked together and eventually became a team really seemed realistic...not a bunch of hokey, horror movie cliches.

I can say what Dawn of the Dead was an OK zombie movie.  If you are looking for a plot line, go somewhere else, because this movie offers none whatsoever. If you are bitten, you die, then become undead, simple as that.  The opening scene was probably the best part of the movie, offering a very chilling experience.  Unfortunately after the opening scene, the movie goes downhill and feels very drawn out with almost no action between the beggining and the end.  The movie just feels overall like old material and cliche.  If you have seen 28 days later, this movie doesnt seem very different. Overall I would give this movie a 5, maybe better because they shoot Burt Reynolds.",Dawn of the Dead

The choice of a new species of zombie (as in 28 days later) induces cool action scenes, with characters turned into real gunslingers for the occasion (the foreheads of all those poor devils seem to be strong bullet-magnets). But we loose that horrible gut feeling we can have when we see a corpse, thinking it could be us, reinforced by the fact that this corpse is a moving parody of the living. These zombies are too much alive for my taste: if they are not as brainless as they used to be, they are less repulsive. They look more like mad people to me than creepy undead. That being said, some people may think slow zombies are a bore...",Dawn of the Dead

What makes Dawn an exceptional movie, is the fact that the characters have depth. Just as soon as you start to like one of them and appreciate his/her quirks he/she wither reveals another layer r gets DEAD.

It set the bar for apocalyptic zombie fests and contained a brain inside its gory exterior. The new Dawn doesn't have that. In fact, the new Dawn doesn't have anything that made the original so great... aside from the mall, of course. That doesn't make it a bad movie. If this movie were named something else, I wouldn't have a single complaint... I would be raving about how fantastic of a zombie movie this was. But they decided to have this as a remake of a Romero classic, and they ripped out everything that made the original so... original. The new Dawn is scary, visceral and fast paced. If they would have slowed it down, and stepped it back a bit so the viewers could get a chance to know the characters, and see the characters reaction to their situation it would have paid better homage to the original. They're different movies, and they are both great in their own right. The new Dawn is excellent in its own way, and in itself sets a new standard for zombie movies. Hopefully the zombie movie will stay around for a while. I would like to see how this sub-genre fleshes out. Only time will tell.",Dawn of the Dead

Great gore and action setpieces, great performances, great moments (the mid-film musical montage in particular is fucking priceless) and a very well executed ending.As with any modern horror film there are a few logical ""what the fu**?"" moments and I do wish the movie had taken more time to develop the sub-plot involving Mekhi Phifer's character and his wife but overall the movie accomplishes what it sets out to do in spades.

To me this movie didn't feel like a remake, it felt more like a reimagining. The opening sequence sucked me right in. I prefer zombies to be slow and stupid, but if ""28 Days Later"" was a reinvention of zombie horror, then i guess having the zombies be fast in this movie is a good follow up on that concept. Survival horror movies rule!  I loved the Jay Leno zombie part that was hilarious. The soundtrack was great too. I liked the version of Disturbed's ""Down with the Sickness"" not done by them- but as like a swing/jazzy kind of song. I hope the DVD has a lot of deleted scenes.

800,delicate_divinity,One of the best zombie movies I have seen yet..,10,19 March 2004,"Wow!  This movie was really great!  After hearing that Dawn of the Dead was going to be remade, I thought that it was a great idea because the original was also good, but it needed some revamping here and there.I checked out the official site for the remake a few weeks ago and the trailers intrigued me, including the ones I watched on television.  And after finally seeing the movie this afternoon, I have no regrets.  This movie will surely make you crap your pants, especially if you watch it in the theatres.  I have to admit half of the time I was holding my hands over my ears, but it didn't keep the movie from scaring the living hell out of me.The introduction was awesome, it starts out just showing the life of an average Mom and then it ends with her waking up to a nightmare.  Even the opening credits will frighten you in a sense, since it is packed with disturbing images and clips.This movie just kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, and there were countless times where everyone else in the theatres along with me screamed and gasped from some of the zombie moments. The bad sides were there were a few unnecessary sex scenes which I don't mind, but I found them to be totally out of subject with the plot.  Eh, that's the kind of stuff that's in most good horror movies anyway. Nothing like a good ol' slash of sex and gore to disturb your audience even more.A 9/10!  I'm definitely planning to get the dvd when it comes out...

When I first heard about this movie I was like everyone else, very uneasy, knowing hollywood was remaking yet another classic. But not only was this a remake of THE zombie movie, I mean the phrase zombie movie and Dawn should be stimeutanous with anyone that is a fan of the genre.Now on to the remake. I went in this movie expecting nothing close to as good as the orginal. And thats what I got, but this remake is a total different movie. I appreciate the pace that it goes, although sometimes you find yourself catching up to the story, over the brisk pace. I think this is by far the best zombie genre movie to come out since Return.

802,chazrevomd,The dead are back.,10,21 March 2004,"May contain minor spoilersThe dead are back.  Dawn appears to be part of a string of neo-zombie movies that have hit theaters recently, including Resident Evil and 28 days. This one, however, is the first to be directly inspired by the original zombie mastermind, Romero.  Dawn was the most engaging of the original dead series, and is the clear choice for a remake.  It is the brilliant juxtaposition of a setting familiar to all consumers, the mall, and an outrageous situation, zombie chaos.  Romero also tossed in a hearty dash of consumer bashing as the zombies waltz around the mall to ludicrous background music.The 2004 version of this film takes the same concept, and injects it with a fat syringe full of adrenaline.  The zombies no longer stumble around, and bump into things.  They are ruthless hunters that know exactly what they want, and know that they have to haul ass to get it.  This makes the movie a much more tense experience than the original.  Snyder takes the serious (almost dry) nature of 28 days later, and blends it beautifully with humanistic (at times silly) tone of the original.The key to the success of Dawn, however, is that it is unlike most recent remakes.  Planet of the Apes or Bedazzled, for example, were both asinine remakes that whither when in the light of the originals.  The complex ideas were lost, and replaced with action and special effects.  The Movies were not updated; they were numbed for a modern audience.  Snyder, Gunn, and company were able to update the film with out numbing it down.  Sure, there is a lot of gore and some CGI, but the story is still controls and reigns in all the special effects and big budget hoopla.Of course the film does have its weak points.  One that comes to mind is when Ving Rhames attempts to recite a line from the original.  It is a thoughtful hypothosis on why the zombies flock to the mall, but Rhames gives the introspective line an awkward tough guy quality.  Still, Rhames shines in a bathroom scene with a little bit of religious rhetoric.Colorful (but perhaps stereotyped) characters, fast moving action, interesting situations, the scariest zombies to grace the screen yet, and all based on a Romero classic.  Justice has been done to the original, and the bar has been raised my friends.  This film breaks new ground for edge of your seat zombie mania.Zombie Fans 10/10 General Film 8.1/10",Dawn of the Dead
803,banedad,STFU,10,20 March 2004,"Anyone who doesn't think this movie deserves a very strong ten out of ten needs to have a screwdriver worked into their ear.I loved the originals, but Romero is, at best, a schlock director. Savini's remake of Night of the Living Dead was better than all three of Romero's, and Romero would have been nothing without Savini.This new movie grabbed me from the beginning, and worked me hard. There were plot holes big enough to throw a zombie baby through, but who cares? I got my moneys worth, and I can't wait for the next one. I agree with everything positive the above commenters have said, and then some.This silly thing wants me to be wordy, and have at least ten lines, so I'll just say that if I had been the character in the gun shop, the movie would have ended a lot differently. And I do tire of the standard ""Charlie, go check the horses"" cliche where some shlub(s) go off into the dark to see if they can be killed like Star Trek Red Shirts.Nevertheless, this was a movie that, if the Oscars weren't such a sad joke, would be a worthy contender for the camera work, if naught else.",Dawn of the Dead
804,DarkDavis,"A great film, regardless of it's predecessor",9,20 March 2004,"Many people are giving this film low scores based simply on the fact that it's based off one of the best zombie films of all time.  I say they're morons.  Drop the Romero-elitist attitudes and recognize this film as a separate entity that deserves an unbiased and objective review, just like any other film.Now that I've said that, I'd like to say that this movie was simply awesome. This was one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen, and also a fantastic horror/action film in general.  I loved ""28 Days Later"" moreso than most, but this film blows it out of the water.  The movie sucks you right in from the very beginning.  The directing, costume/makeup and camera work is downright phenomenal for this genre.  All too often with past zombie flicks I've found myself less than pleased with the way shots were done, the way action was communicated and even the appearance of the zombies.  Not so in Dawn of the Dead.Character development is good and not overdone.  By that, I mean you learn enough about the characters to really relate to them, but you're left with enough room to imagine yourself in the same situation and develop your own view of each of the characters, instead of sitting there watching long close-ups and inner-thought dialogs wondering what the hell is going on in the character's head while the writer futilely tries to communicate some deep emotion.  This is a zombie movie, we're not here to ponder sentiment, we're here to be flung head-first into the dark, frightening, hopeless experience of Hell on Earth, and that's exactly what has been delivered with ""Dawn of the Dead"".I gave this film a 9/10.  It's my new favorite horror movie of all time (the former being Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"").  You will get the crap scared out of you, and if you like horror movies at all, you will love every second of this one. :)",Dawn of the Dead
805,neonemo,well worth the price of admission for me,9,21 March 2004,"Not a ""remake"" so much as a ""revision"" of Romero's famous original.  While some of the more appealing elements of the original are gone (like most of the ""mindless mall rat"" aspect of the zombies), and others of the original rules are bent or broken, I'd still rate this as the best zombie movie since, well, the last Romero-inspired film (Day of the Dead).With a bigger budget, bigger stars, and bigger effects, the movie is somewhat more of an action film than the original Romero series...and that worked quite well for me.  My own personal rating of a flick like this depends heavily on the creep factor, the adrenaline factor, or a combination of both...and as far as I was concerned it delivered.Could this movie (and last year's far more turgid 28 Days Later) signal the revival of the true horror flick?  Well, yes, it could.  I personally found it refreshing to have zombies that moved fast -- and the nature of the film is powered up by that notion.  Imagine BlackHawk Down crossed with the original Dawn of the Dead.  There are a number of big, fast-paced, grab-your-attention-and-don't-let-go sequences that had me gritting my teeth in both tension and enjoyment.Final analysis -- there are only a few obvious improvements that could have been made, I'll go see the flick again for a second round of enjoyment, and I'm already looking forward to the eventual DVD release.  Two thumbs up (that's all I'm equipped with).(Oh yeah...did I mention?  All the blood looks =real=, as do virtually all of the gore effects, a rare event in any horror film).",Dawn of the Dead

So on Friday I took in the second showing (didn't want to skip classes for the first). I bought my ticket in advance, went alone (my wife and friends are not so big on the genre) and hoped that this movie would not be a letdown. I was very pleasantly surprised. From start to finish, this movie had me glued to my seat pondering at one point the best time to get up and use the washroom. The plot moved briskly but without missing any important details. There were many subtle jokes made throughout the film as well as many allusions to the original, however if someone half-watched this movie they would not miss any important plot details. I'm not sure if I like fast zombie approach as I found that the original slow moving zombie added to the suspense. But all that being said it worked just fine. The direction was good, with some things seeming to jump out and hit you. The special effects were very well done, and the characters were believable. I would not hesitate to recommend this film to anyone and may even go see it again myself.

807,jwooly61,"A Fast Paced, Scary, Must See",9,28 March 2004,"I loved the original, and I loved this one, maybe a little more.  To compare the two movies is like comparing apples and oranges.The Similarities: The main characters are in a mall, one of them is a black cop, one of them is pregnant, and the walking dead (in Dawn 2004 the running dead) are intent on snacking on them.  That's where most of the similarities end.The Differences: The original had a slow building sense of dread and tension and was full of Romeroish social commentary regarding consumerism, racism and the haves and have nots of society.  Within the first five minutes or so of Dawn 2004, you are jump-started into the fast paced world or zombie horror.  All throughout this movie, I literally found my heart thumping furiously in my chest.  As far as the social commentary was concerned, I don't think there was any.  I could care less about social commentary anyway.  I go to the movies for the entertainment value and Dawn 2004 paid off handsomely.  In the original, there was a certain amount of slap stick humor that eventually became very dark and serious (i.e. the bikers in the mall).  Fewer characters in the original led to more character development. Dark humor was present in Dawn 2004 (i.e. the celebrity shoot off).  In the original, if a zombie got after you, you might want to pick up your pace to brisk walk if you didn't want to become a protein snack.  In Dawn 2004, if a zombie got after you, you better be gettin jiggy-wit-it or you're gonna get chomped.I loved both movies.  Both of them entertained and scared me thoroughly. I gave the original a two thumbs up rating.  I have to give Dawn 2004 two thumbs and a roscoe pointed skyward.",Dawn of the Dead
808,commiewhiteboy,great as a regular movie,10,22 March 2004,"this one blew the old one away. there wasn't a drawn-out part of this one in which the survivors just hang out. that's taken care of in an entertaining montage. there's better action, more plot, more characterization, you're with the characters more. there's so many stages to the movie, so much happens. it isn't a satire like the original, which works for this movie. it works like classic adventure stories work: it's about people finding strength and sticking together in incredible struggles. it's the best ""regular"" movie of any zombie movie i've seen, and perhaps the best zombie movie. one of the ten best movies of the past year or two. the classic was fantastic. this one was better.",Dawn of the Dead
809,matador62,"Good, yet not good enough",9,22 March 2004,"Being a faithful follower of George Romero's Dead trilogy (Night, Dawn, and Day), I was somewhat satisfied with the remake of Dawn of the Dead. It has great action!!!! However, it lacks in some areas. There are too many characters, thus leading to a lack of character depth. The running zombies just didn't cut it for me as it reminded us of the ghouls in 28 days later (i.e., seemed like a sequel to 28 days later at times). Finally, if the dead are returning to life, then why is it only those who have been bitten?!?!?!? Those shot or dying of natural causes do not re-animate!!!! That's a major difference from the trilogy and Romero's concept. MAJOR FLAW in my opinion. On the other hand, the action is great and does an amazing job at causing tension and anxiety in moviegoers (I think I checked every room in the apartment when I got home). Also, the story line is good enough to maintain one's attention. I suggest loyal and new fans go see the remake, all will enjoy!!!! Little piece of ADVICE, stay till the end of the end credits.....there are some extras to the story line...don't leave the theatre until everthing is done!!!!",Dawn of the Dead
810,MajorTomG,Exelently funny disgusting tribute. A must see.,9,22 March 2004,"The first few minutes of the film are pure genius. The build up of the situation with the zombies is fantastic. The zombies themselves are a clever mix of the zombies from the original trilogy and from the recent '28 days later'. They still trudge around groaning in the classic chillingly mindless way. But then they see a human and go beserk and start running ferociosly towards there prey with all their strength. They are fantastic mindless killers.The gore is second to none in quality and quantity. This film is the result of the director and screenplay writer being true fans of the genre paying tribute to all classic zombie movies. This is not a remake. So if you see other people winging that, ""it's not as good as the origional"" just ignore it. GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE for yourself. Ignore the title and accept it for the quality modern horror that it is. This is one of the very few movies that had potential, recieved the budget it desrerved, was taken seriously by all involved, was directed in an origional and peasingly clever way, and was pulled off as one of the most entertaining movies in a long time.The movie doesn't get boring at any time. The comic relief between the scary, frightening, disgusting (very), and genuinely sad moments is timed perfectly. You will know exactly what I mean when you hear the jazz version of 'down with the sickness'. Everyone laughed and some even applauded the timing.This film is a fantastic cinema experience. GO and see it at the big screen while you can. A must.PS. The ending is great. Stay seated through the credits.",Dawn of the Dead
811,ceckart,Even though different from orig it was done very well,10,22 March 2004,"Even though this movie was shot differently and the details were different. It did have the same gist of the previous release.  Also what is great, the ending makes a more seamless transition into day of the dead.  And the cameo from Tom Savini was great.  I am sure not many people picked up, but it was great!  This movie could not have been remade any better.  Zack Snyder did an excellent job!  I have seen all the others several times and I could watch this one over and over and over as well.  For someone to remake a classic sets them up for disaster if they are not careful and this remake was an absolute success!   I could go on and on about the differences between the original and this one.  But is not worth it, as they are two distinct  movies that stand out.  Can't wait to see what else is next, as many classics are being remade.",Dawn of the Dead
812,mop414,Good Stand Alone Zombie Movie,10,22 March 2004,"I went to see this movie on Friday night, I liked this movie.  I tried not to get my hopes up too much because the original is such a great movie.I think this movie was more of an action movie, where the original was more creepy because they built the characters more and there were less action sequences.The new version was made more creepy for me, having it based in Wisconsin, hearing the Milwaukee Emergency Broadcast System, seeing Milwaukee Squad Cars, and the County Bus.  Hearing that Miller Park is no longer safe. Living in Milwaukee all my life, having these points made it a little more realistic for me.Also very cool were the cameos by some of the cast from the 1978 version of Dawn.  Scott Reiniger (Roger/General), Ken Foree (Peter/Televangelist), and Tom Savini (Motorcycle Gang Member/Sheriff).  Those were the three my friends and I spotted.Anyway, all in all it was a good movie, but not in the same category as the first.",Dawn of the Dead
813,stnj1980,The Best,10,22 March 2004,"The internet, because it is so high-tech, allows for many useful functions and uses. One of them is to let me tell everybody (who can read) how f***ing spectacular this movie is. No previous zombie film... maybe even ANY horror film... comes close to delivering as much terror and awe as this theatrical legend does. Any pessimist or coffee shop-employed, movie critic wannabe can just shove a cracked baseball bat up their ass instead of bitching about how ""It wasn't as good as the 1978 version."" or ""It reminded me of 28 Days Later...) WAAAH!!! Cry me a river and drown yourself in it, douchebag. This piece of work has a potpourri cast of characters that really beautifies the film and makes you think ""It's great that these people are here, respecting each other as humans, charging foward each day in an attempt to survive... however, it is sad that it took a tragedy of this magnitude to get them here."" Besides the characters, it has a great soundtrack for the type of film it is and shows vast improvement over the 1978 versions cliche disco-horror music. The lounge-version of ""Down with the Sickness"" and the closing credits song are absolutely fantastic. The movie itself is a great evolved piece of George A. Romero's screenplay and is a testament to his genius and Zack Synder's courage and prowess.",Dawn of the Dead
814,dsebag,The definitive horror in every way. THIS IS HORROR AT ITS WORSE!,10,22 March 2004,"I like to see horror movies to escape from reality at times.  The only trouble is most of them feel fake or to make Hollywood happy it's toned down or it gets a ""happy"" ending.  The original Dawn of the dead gave you a feel of terror and helplessness... but probably due to a low budget it couldn't go all the way so it wasn't ferocious enough.   Every missing aspect of the original has been integrated in this update and it never lets you down. When you leave this movie any problem you may have in your personal life is nothing compared to what the world is perceived as in this picture.  Even without reflection you feel some sort of comfort to be on the other side of the screen.  A real horror movie isn't made to give you cheap scares, it's made to terrify you.  If it achieves that, you know that the movie deserves its due credit.  In every possible way Dawn of the Dead 2004 is the best horror movie ever made in history and since the last ""best horror movie"" was the original Dawn, I don't think it will ever be topped... well maybe in one case: Since this movie was rated R, the DVD will probably be released as ""Unrated"" like the original Dawn was.  If that is the case it could well be the most disgusting movie ever made as well! (Day of the Dead (1984 Unrated) is still the champion because of its realism.)  Most people can't think with this frame of mind but if you keep the frame of mind I'm writing about, you too will enjoy this masterpiece!",Dawn of the Dead
815,eric-490,Liked it but.,8,23 March 2004,"O.K. 1st, I loved the first 10 minutes when everything was just chaos, people waking up to their loved ones trying to eat them. I wish they would have shown more of that.Zombies running, jumping & climbing was cool, even though they did'nt do that in the original. But what I did'nt like is that the zombies did'nt kill and eat EVERY living thing including that stupid dog ""chip"". In NOTL Dead 68'  Zombies ateRats, Bugs, Worms even burned remains of people, any flesh they could gettheir hands on. But in Dawn OT Dead 04' they did'nt have a taste for little chip.Hopefully, in the sequel the zombies will remember to put a little HOT SAUCEon the none human flesh, TO BETTER THE TASTE!",Dawn of the Dead
816,ben_322-1,about time!,10,29 March 2004,"I must say, i havent seen a decent horror movie in some time, and already loving the first Dawn of the Dead, i was really looking forward to this one. I wasnt let down. I wasnt expecting to see an oscar winning film here, all i wanted was 90mins of entertaining, leave my brain at the door blood guts and gore. It is never going to top the original, because that was ground breaking, but it comes very close. The story being similar in the fact that there are zombies and they are stuck in a mall, thats about where it ends though with regards to this. The main change which made it a lot more exciting was the fact that the zombies were fast and more terrifying, no longer thinking, ""its alright they can just walk round them""! The film is in your face right from the word go, and rarely lets up until the end, but the end is a tad disapointing though. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys this genre. Great stuff! 9/10",Dawn of the Dead
817,amidstthechaos,As compared to the original,9,5 April 2004,"From the first 15 minutes of the film, I quickly decided the newly revamped Dawn of the Dead was my new favorite horror film. This feeling carried me to the very last moment of the credit reel. The directorial style and cinematography brilliantly blended new aspects of thriller genre camera work, basic narrative portrayal, and the same kind of old school shots found in the original version of the film. This adaptation picked up the horror where the original version left it more as subplot for the in-your-face down-your-throat satirical attempt at political statement and assult to capitalism and the blossoming consumer market. Don't get me wrong, the political aspects weren't entirely unfounded and were well thought out in some aspects. It was saturated with symbolism and hit on some major discussions of the time. My problem with it was it wasn't about the zombies! If I want political rhetoric, I'll watch an Oliver Stone flick. If I'm watching a movie entitled ""Dawn of the Dead"" I want zombies. I want ripping and eating and blood and gore and let's not forget fear for lives and too-close-for-comfort escapes. The new version was full of all the aspects I crave in a good horror film. Suspense, gore, character connection, and those nice little moments where you actually pop up from your seat a bit. Honestly, I must admit I don't know what makes the original a classic but I am surely glad they decided to do the remake. Granted there were a few holes in the plot, moments that you say to yourself, ""Why the hell didn't they just do that a couple weeks ago if that was an option?"" However, I suppose that's just a constant in the horror genre. If everyone was logical not nearly as many people would be killed, situations could be better averted, and we would have no plot to unfold.",Dawn of the Dead
818,Tockymon,you get what you pay for,7,30 March 2004,"Just seen dawn of the dead and would like to say i was very pleased with what i saw, i walked into the cinema not taking anything too serious or expecting a master piece, just some gore and violence satisfying fun.This film gave me that and then some, the camera work and style of direction was superb, the humour dark and overall atmosphere of the film was very foreboding.I especially liked the fact that the zombies could run (Like in 28days later) and didnt just shuffle along. (Lets face it, how could zombies take over the world if all you had to do was start a brisk walk to escape?)The makeup is excellent, the acting wasnt as wooden as expected, and the cringe inducing action will keep u wondering how much further things can go. Its also amazing what you can do with a credit sequence these days :-)",Dawn of the Dead
819,edgarticker,not a good review,1,30 March 2004,"I'm begging for a refund and to be paid for the 2 hours of my life wasted watching this movie. NO real story line, no surprises, nothing other than zombies who kill people, but only when the people are dumb enough to get close to them. Lots of potential in the beginning, but once they hit the mall, there is no story, just a random series of events leading to an ending. I think they threw in a little bit of nudity in the middle to get people who were drifting away to focus for a few seconds... Good Lord, Waterworld was better than this piece of crap. I know 5 year old kids who could have written a less predictable script. How did they get out of the situation when the gassed the zombies and burned them? Did that eliminate ALL of the zombies down there? How in the world did every person in that movie learn how to shoot like that? I thought they were going somewhere with water when they showed the dramatic shot of the nurse washing the blood off her hands in the fountain and then the 'twitcher' splashing around in there...Where did these people come up with the ability to trick out those shuttles? All of the sudden they're welders and metal fabricators? Come on...",Dawn of the Dead
820,killerwhale-2,This was a great movie!!!,9,2 April 2004,"When I saw this version of Dawn of the Dead of course I didn't expect this to blow away and be even better then the 1979 version of Dawn of the Dead cause hey a remake can not beat a masterpiece.  But the nontheless I still thought this version was a great movie and I enjoyed it greatly, the ending was a bit of a suprise and honestly sort of reminded me of another zombie me called well Zombie back in 1980 cause of the whole island and zombies on the island thing.  Ving Rahems, Sarah Polley, Mihkei Phifier, Jake Webber and the rest of the cast was excellent and didn't do a poor or cliche acting job as other zombie movies do often.  The violence and gore was good, but could of been more graphic and violent like the original Dawn of the Dead was, but of course the MPAA won't allow it so I understand (I guess we will have to wait for the unrated version to come on DVD lol) the fast, running zombies is a depature from the original and traditionally slow moving zombies, but we are in the 2000's now so hollywood has to conform to today's standards so the running zombies are ok.  Anyway to end my comments I do not think this movie in anyway will be nominated for an academy award, but this should certainly mark the return of the living dead or if u don't get what I'm saying the return of the zombie movies.  Now I'm just wondering if the Italians are going to remake Zombie since they made the original Zombie right after the original Dawn of the Dead was made.  Anyway from the looks of it this movie will be a huge hit as I'm writing now 4/2/2004 it grossed already $44,000,000 and still counting.  Shout out to the cast, director, and crew who made this version of Dawn of the Dead u guy's did an awesome job.",Dawn of the Dead

The acting was great,the special effects were great and overall,I was very impressed. I am hoping that there may be a sequel to this once that all is said and done. The ending did place a little doubt in ones' mind as to what the outcome was. The updated version of how the zombies moved and carried themselves was definitely needed. The fact that the zombies moved as fast as a normal person made it even more exciting and convincing. I guarantee you that if you take it upon yourself to go and see this movie,you definitely will not be disappointed. I took a friend with me to see it who really isn't into horror flicks and science fiction,but he left the movie theater totally satisfied.

And I thought it did well in adding in new stuff, while still staying close to the original screenplay. I also loved the cameo's they had and that truck that the old lady drove in the beginning was also from the first film! And if the end made you say, WHAT! Thats It? THATS THE ENDING? Well, if you remember, it is similar to the end of the original Dawn of the Dead. Also, my favorite part was when the guy Andy, the guy in the building across from the mall, is shooting the zombies that look like celebrities! I thought that was funny!I liked all the comedy in this film a lot! Anyway, this movie is good in my book!",Dawn of the Dead
824,philmurray_7,You have to see this film!!!!!!,10,16 April 2004,"I went into this film not expecting too much from it as the original was utterly crap, cheesy in every sense of the word. However the film took what was a great original concept and made it into the film it was destined to be. When the film began I thought it might spend the first half hour explaining how the zombies came to be, but, I was thrust right into the action about five minutes in. The very first zombie scene in the bedroom had me jumping out my chair at every second, I was astonished. The film manages to keep up it's great suspense and also throw in some great humour without making the film cheesy. I will also give you a tip for when you go to see it, do not leave right after what you think is the ending as the credits roll the real ending comes alive on the screen which I found to complete the film as the first ending was a bit too cliched and the proper ending left me wondering. Not only does it outclass the original in every way but it's also excellent as a stand-alone film. Everyone MUST see this film!!!!",Dawn of the Dead
825,Weava,School report about this wonderful film,10,14 April 2004,"Dawn of the Dead was recreated just a few short weeks ago. The original screenplay, written by George A. Romero, was combined with the one written more recently by James Gunn. I think Gunn did a wonderful job keeping the original story intact while adding a bit of humor and his own style to the movie. The movie was directed by Zack Snyder and produced by Eric Newman, Marc Abraham, and Richard Rubinstein. It was done by Universal studios and was released in March 2004. The movie is rated R for pervasive strong horror violence and gore, language and sexuality. The leading actors were well chosen in my opinion, and include Sarah Polley as the lead actress and Ving Rhames and Jake weber as leading actors. I think this movie fits in well with Romero's former films. Although it has a bit more humor to it, it still retains the original gore and horror. This movie will shock you at some points, and have you giggling at others. It's a wonderful remake of a wonderful movie. The plot can simply be summarized as `zombies are killing EVERYONE,' which is to be expected when seeing a Romero film. It starts out in a small town, showing the havoc that this new virus is reeking. No one is sure exactly what is going on, but the only sure thing is to watch your back at all times. People are on a rampage, killing and eating everyone in site. One woman runs into a cop, who lets her tag along with him. They soon find 3 more folks who are heading to the mall. As anyone who has seen the original will know, this is where the bulk of the movie will take place. The long series of scenes at the mall are very different. Some are humorous, while others are violent and gory. The movie rolls onward as the plan their escape from the mall, and they venture outward. The acting was very well done. I very much enjoyed how Ana, or Sarah Polley, didn't act like most women in zombie movies. She took situations head on, and didn't scream and whine about what was occurring. Kenneth, or Ving Rhames, was a very good team `badass.' He made sure stuff was done right. Michael, or Jake Weber, added a sense of romance, while still adding to the comedic value of some scenes. As in the original `Night of the Living Dead,' we are given someone to hate. We hated `Cooper' in that one and we definitely hate, or love, Steve in this movie. He did a great job of p***ing everyone off and saving his own ass in all situations. All things considered, I think the cast did a great job of recreating this masterpiece. Several camera angles were used throughout the movie to show that a surprise was coming. You see someone go to a door and slowly open it, showing a close-up of the person of the door handle, only to find a zombie jump out at them. The slowed down movement lets you know something is going to happen, but it always scares you when it does. I don't understand why, but this technique seems to always do its job. One technique which has been widely used lately, was the combining of comedy with horror. This movie however, I believe utilizes this technique to the fullest. `Scary Movie' for example, completely got rid of the horror while adding a large amount of comedy. This was somewhat of a letdown as it turned from horror spoof, into `stupid teen comedy.' `Dawn of the Dead' added comedy amidst the horror, but only at appropriate times. At times where there was a break in the action, or times when you would least expect it, the writers through in a joke, or ironic situation to keep the viewers laughing and scared at the same time. The production techniques used and many of the camera angles added to the already wonderful story in the film. I've read before that there was symbolism behind the mall itself. The original was put out at a time when malls were beginning to gain popularity. People were flocking to malls to get `whatever they wanted' in one place. So these people, in a time of terror, go to the mall. Some believe Romero was mocking the population in some respects, since these people did not spend all their time trying to better their situation, but used much of it just getting `whatever they wanted. This time however it was free, and it showed the greed of humans. Greed, or in this case selfishness, can lead to stupid situations. One man ties his dead, now `zombified,' wife to a bed in an attempt to bring his unborn child into the world. He knows the pain and suffering he is putting his wife through, but continues to do it. His situation does not, however, end up exactly as planned. This is another way Romero and Gunn could be mocking the population. I think the underlying theme behind much of this movie is that humans are stupid, greedy, and self centered. I would give this movie a 10/10, had it been filmed in Monroeville Mall. (Since I am from Pittsburgh) However, I will still give it a 9/10. I highly suggest seeing it, but not until you see the original. I would also suggest seeing the original Dawn of the dead, Day of the dead, Night of the Living dead, and Return of the dead, although Return is not a Romero film. I would also urge you to go see this movie now. Don't wait for it to come out on video, as it is one of my favorite movies of late. The humor adds so much to this wonderful classic, which can appeal to any audience, young or old.",Dawn of the Dead

I found it and watched it today with my friend and I was mind-blown. Finally, someone has got it right. Remakes tend to be a bit rubbish but this was fantastic. The plot was great, the beginning was perfect, the actor/actress choices were amazing and the whole movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I did not want this movie to end at all. The character development was great throughout the movie and I defiantly had a favorite and least-liked characters.

827,BenBarley_aka_xxxxxxxxxxxxxposed,The film that should of been Resident Evil!,8,20 April 2004,"I heard about this film and seen the adverts/trailer on TV. After taking a keen interest to the trailer i was wondering in my mind is this a real horror with gore blood and guts or is it another teen movie where 6 teenagers are stuck in a building one by one mysteriously disappearing with no logical reason only for the film to end with the pretty guy and the sexy girl survivng! This film is so not that!This is chilling and frightening..it is the sort of film that when you walk out of the cinema you think a blood sucking zombie is going to jump out and start chewing away at your flesh! The main thing that makes this film real is that there are extremly little (if any)unrealistic computer generated graphics..its all done on make up and good acting! (when i mean computer generated graphics i mean like the Licker that appears at the end of Res Evil movie) It all starts off in a hospital where a main character is working as a nurse..being rushed on a wheely hospital bed is a guy who has a bite on his head *making this seem like something that requires stiches and can be treated easily""..at this time everything is totally normal..then when this young nurse go's home and gets to bed after a hard days work she and her husband wake up to something disturbing!...this is where it begins!...the horror starts here!lol enough of me banging on..the film has that feeling of suspense that you need in a horror movie ""OH MY GOD WHATS GONNA HAPPEN...oh no its only a pussy cat"" sort of stuff where you think something bad is gonna happen and then it is just nothing at all,but then something will jump out and make you need to go to the toilet really badly! The film also has alot of comedy to it..one part..where the survivors are on the roof of the building where they escape to and across the street of a spectacular wave of living dead people is a man who owns a gun shop sat on the roof with a sniper rifle!..he on his own and Kenneth (Ving Rhames) are talking by writing down what ever it is they want to say on a whiteboard..they play chess but also Kenneth tells the guy which Zombie Celebrity lookalike he wants to shoot (like Burt Reynolds looking zombie) but its little funny bits like that make you realise that only in a film they can shed light on being trapped in a building surrounded by infected skin eating dead people!The acting is fabulous but what makes it hard to believe is how the characters react to some of the situations. All in all this is the best horror i have seen yet (could be an all time great) and i would rate this top of the list as a must go see for 2004!This one gets 8/10",Dawn of the Dead

Some things were a little bit unrealistic but I think that was added for the humor, the characters had a surprising depth while at the same time being a little bit predictable. This is now one of my holy grail moves. If you're considering watching this, do it, you will not be disappointed. The only reason not to watch would be if you get queasy with gore, in which case you should probably avoid the whole zombie movie genre. The ending was great, a little predictable but when you watch through the credits you really get the full closure. The cinematography was great, the acting was amazing, and the characters were quite realistic. Great film.",Dawn of the Dead

831,kemeticpoet,What's wrong with the critics?,4,23 May 2004,"I don't get it. Why is it that the critics, who often dislike otherwise good movies over petty details, actually LIKED this thing? I hated this movie.Warning: contains spoilers.""Dawn of the Dead,"" or more precisely, ""Yawn of the Dead"" is another cookie-cutter horror movie for the masses. As the movie progressed I picked out so many things I hated that I couldn't fit it all into one review.A note first: I am judging this based on its own merits as a stand-alone film. I believe movies should be judged on their own, and I have attempted, as much as possible, to enjoy it as its own entity, without comparing to the original. However, since it does bear a resemblance at some points, I have had to compare just a little to illustrate a point. The movie begins pretty well. I knew the little kid was going to die, because otherwise she had no reason to be on-camera so early and for so short a time. Predictable. Willing to ignore that, it started pretty well. The city in flames, everyone getting killed... I had no problem with this early part and found it did quite well to bring about a feeling of apocalypse.The movie went downhill quickly. The woman in the beginning forgot about her dead husband within 5 minutes. Why? Because they didn't want to concentrate on character development. This is the major problem I had throughout the whole film.Another example of this: the conversation between the police officer and the young man in the bathroom was interesting. I would have liked to see more of this, see their opinions and conversations grow or shift as the movie went on. The problem is, again, the director wanted to throw a reference to religion in so he could say he did so, but didn't want to bring it up again, like he did with so many other concepts in the film. Religion is brought up, briefly, with a televangelist talking about ""When there's no more room in hell..."" but this is obviously thrown in only to use the tagline from the original. It makes no sense here, where the zombies are a result of a virus, and I can't see a Christian preacher saying this in any event(in the original it was quoted from a Voudon priest). Note I'm not calling the characters by name. Why? They were too 2-dimensional for me to remember, to be honest. I couldn't remember half the characters in the film most of the time.Another example. In the original, we learn that the woman is pregnant only after hints, secrets, foreshadowing, etc. In this one, two characters meet three characters, and BAM one is 8 months pregnant. Why? Because the director wanted the sudden shock of pregnancy, but didn't want to do as Romero did, byt actually using character development to lead up to the revelation. That would take actual work with a plot and with dialogue, and this movie is just about blowing people up.The way the characters get to the mall is similarly contrived. When the two characters meet the other three, they ask them ""Where are you headed?"" One of the three responds ""We're going to the mall."" Which, of course, just happens to be right behind them, so that no time has to be taken up traveling to the mall or talking or anything. That scene was about when I realized the film was going to suck.The whole movie is contrived, just like that scene, with weak(or no) dialogue and zero character development, except for the security guard wil suddenly becomes a good guy. The ""surprise ending"" was lame, also. I have no problem with characters dying en masse, but seriously, think about it. Did it really make any sense?The major problem with the film is one I've been mentioning. The movie had too much crammed in, and not enough attention given to any one part. We have all the themes of the originals, really: religion; people fighting themselves while they should be fighting the undead; a fear of what is causing this menace; a pregnancy in the midst of this terror; innocent victims rescued and taken in; waiting on the military; and so on. The problem is, instead of concentrating on a couple strong themes and working them, the film has all of these things thrown in and then doesn't really pay attention to any of them, opting for zombie massacre footage instead.Similarly, instead of having three or four characters developed and continued strongly, we have a dozen or so characters, most of which appear nameless and pointless, and which the audience doesn't care about.I might have liked the movie more if I hadn't been in an audience full of idiots. Some people behind me started laughing when the one guy on the other building said he was starving. Yeah, that's real funny, morons.On that note, I would like to say that the one part of the movie that I did like were the scenes where they were playing games with the guy across the street, or having fun in the mall in general. Those were decent scenes, and I think, aside from the graphic sex in one part, would have fit into the original movie really well.One last thing: I saw a bunch of little kids in the audience. What's wrong with you people? Why the hell are you taking children to see this kind of movie? I mean if the graphic violence and profanity doesn't offend you, what about the nudity and sex? Is this appropriate for your children?Overall, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 1 being useless and 5 being perfect, I give it ** stars. Not quite horrible, but below average, certainly.",Dawn of the Dead
832,vuzman-1,"Good film, unfortunately with some flaws.",7,21 September 2004,"Now this is a film you don't get to see every day! The mere fact that this film's a remake and does only suck a little makes it special, but what nearly a real gem these days, if there weren't those stupid flaws I mean, is the exclusion of clichés (well, the most of 'em). Like, if this was the typical profit-oriented, no-room-for-artsy-stuff flick, it would drown with the other crappy attempts to make money of abusing the good reputation and cult of its originals. But actually, this one succeeds in combining modern video-clip aesthetics with effective cinematography and good storytelling.The films first ten minutes are hilarious. Not only because the opening begins with the end of the world right away, but also because the credits begin not until those ten minutes. Another plus is the avoidance of any explanations for the zombie-phenomenon and, oh the word ""zombie"" isn't mentioned at all! It's disappointing, to be honest, that the heroes don't coincidentally find a book, left on a table somewhere, that describes them how to get rid of the plague and that standard lines, like ""I won't leave you here!"", are missing. Well, for the satirical aspect: it is really ironic seeing that, with the problems that come from the 4th amendment, only gun carrying people survive at the beginning - Matt Groening will probably like this message. What unfortunately really flaws the film and nearly destroys it, if there weren't those action-packed scenes following after, is firstly the aspect of everyone shooting the zombies in the head (the only way to kill them) with a near 99% accuracy, which is something one can live with since only gun-crazy people survive the attacks and reach the mall. Secondly, there is a scene which really is ridiculous (and I don't mind spoiling it), where a woman risks her life for a dog and after that having everyone risk their lives for the same stupid woman. What also bothered me was the Character of Steve, whose job is nothing but being an asshole and - surprise! - dying at the end, leaving all the ""good guys"" to survive. But aside from that, it is a really good film which has its moments - whether they are funny, action-loaded or exciting.",Dawn of the Dead

No, instead there were running zombies, who didn't even look all that dead and a stillborn zombie baby. Now that's just wrong. If I wanted to see Mekhi Pfifer deliver a stillborn baby, I would watch ER. And the fat zombie woman that was clearly a guy in a dress. There were none of the characters from the original film. Ken Foree was a preacher who said his old characters tag line, but that was it. And it looked like somebody left a light filter off of the camera.

It was full of action and seriously kept me wanting to see more from the moment I sat down.The ending wasn't great though. I couldn't tell exactly what happened, but I suppose it was good to let us wonder, in a way. The whole baby thing was a little freaky. I was happy to see an elevator scene!

The dark humor is still there, and so are the conflicts between the main characers. The biggest different from Romeros film is the added action sequences, which are much like the ones in 28 days later (which also is a great modern Zombie-tale).The only real flaw is the patriotic under tones which shines through in a couple of times in the movie.This is a must see for all movie lovers who wants 100 minutes of ""jumping in the seat"", ""laughing like h..l"" and ""biting their finger nails"".Enjoy the film!",Dawn of the Dead

Of the few similarities that both movies share, the shopping mall being the most obvious, they're quite actually very subtle. I understand that filming of a sequel is to begin shooting early next year.

I'm no expert, but chainsaws, shotguns, gasoline fires, and stakes seem spot on. Off course, this movie did spend a lot more money than the 70' or 80' horror flicks (counting for inflation). So there is a lot more of everything.As always, I was annoyed by the sub fifties IQ level of the main characters, but that is what these movies are all about. Screaming at the screen, WHY, oh why don't you try something else? Like what I just thought about... Oh well, I guess they're not especially fit for survival.What amazes me is the utterly hostile reaction all characters meet each other with once they first meet. Is this how Americans greet each other? In a disaster area? They kind of grow and become more humane during the movie, but no reason is given for their ape like behavior in the first place. Well, it is a splatter movie, who needs character development anyway?But still, I feel there is some attempt of character development in there somewhere. It feels wrong, it is disturbing.

And with obvious additions of FX(which weren't available, I know), more characters, a wider scope, and more comedy (great cameos) as well, as much as I know it cant replace the original it comes calling.

No, the character development won't rival some of the major epics of our time, but it's a horror movie. People don't watch it for the romance or the emotion. You're watching to be frightened and to be entertained. A little gore doesn't hurt either.There is enough character development along the way that I did care about what happened to these people. I didn't care about many of them, but I did care. Ving Rhames is a great actor in his own right and Sarah Polley has the potential to be an action heroine as she plays off the ludicrous horror well and sells the action very well.I highly recommend this movie to a fan of horror, young or old.

850,avallaunius,Braindead,2,6 January 2005,"I found this film to be truly awful, mainly because I don't like action films. I don't consider it to be a zombie film or even a horror film. Zombies are supposed to be slow and stupid because they are dead. Their muscles are supposed to have been damaged, decayed or suffering from rigor mortis. Their brains are dead and thus incapable of thought, this results in stupid behaviour and lack of coordination. This unnatural behaviour contrasts with what we expect of a human being. In other words we are disturbed by the abnormal movements of the zombie-human. This is horror. In this film, the monsters run about and act more like insane but otherwise normal humans. They are not creepy at all. They do have an exciting shock value. This is action.The director obviously had so little idea of how he wanted his zombie extras to behave that he resorts to some pathetically cheap shaky camera techniques. If you can somehow forget that they are supposed to be zombies you might be able to enjoy this as an action film, but not a horror film. It should not be called Dawn of the Dead.",Dawn of the Dead

Unlike other horror movies, you feel more immersed because of the realistic zombies.It lacked in other departments, though. For me, it was only exciting in the beginning and the end. The middle was long and tedious, broken up only by the occasional event -- which often turned out to be a dud. There was one really strange part (more strange than scary, which is a reoccurring theme in this movie) which sort of livened things up, but other than that, it was dull in the center.The acting was convincing.

855,AgreeWithFrank,"A genuinely scary movie, and a lot of fun. Run, zombies, run!",9,29 December 2004,"Having missed this film in theaters, I have only the Director's Cut DVD to go by, but I must say ""WOW!"" Snyder and Gunn's adaptation of George Romero's 1978 zombie thriller is a nonstop roller coaster of suspense, despair and horrific thrills. This film gives the audience a scant five minutes or so to get comfortable in their seats, and then sends them rocketing through a story in which you must ask yourself, ""What would I do if the end of the human race seemed to be upon me?"" You will see so many basic human emotions in the face of such an unimaginable tragedy: shock, denial, acceptance, sorrow and anger. You will constantly put yourself in the characters' places and ask what you would have done differently. You will marvel at their instinct for survival, applaud them when they succeed and feel the frustration when they fail. One of the more controversial topics of discussion in regards to this movie is the swift physical capabilities of the zombies. This is a stroke of genius in the making of this film, however. When you've seen zombie movies in the past, you've often watched as the zombies s-l-o-w-l-y stagger towards their prey, often dragging a leg behind and reaching them only because the character ran away screaming, yet continuously turns to look back, and finally trips on...nothing? I for one was never impressed. That was never scary, it was disappointing. When the zombies are constantly running towards everyone they see with only the maniacal urge to kill, however, it becomes a seriously frightening concept. How do you defend yourself against groups of dead people who feel no pain, have no fear, experience no fatigue and move as fast as you can? I highly recommend this film for it's action, it's shock value and it's ability to portray the basic instinct of human preservation. It may not win an Academy Award, but this is one fantastic thriller for the 21st Century.",Dawn of the Dead
856,Dim3nsional,Rejuvenation of the zombie genre!,10,8 January 2005,"I am a huge fan of the zombie genre and I 'craved the flesh' of a good modern day zombie flick. I watched the DVD directors cut version of this movie with high expectations as this was my most anticipated movie of the year and I just loved it so much I had to write a quick review on it. Dawn of the Dead is a modern day remake of George A Romero's 1978 Dawn Of The Dead. The story follows several survivors of an epidemic of undead, as they barricade themselves inside the local mall to survive the growing zombie plague. The movie is filled with many tense, thrilling moments where it is comically broken with humour; this is a good thing that adds a human factor into the movie. The performances were believable and realistic given the whole Armageddon scenario which was pleasing to see and a great choice to include the character known as Andy. Without doubt the true stars are the zombies. The makeup for the undead was nothing short of amazing, with by far the best visuals and makeup of any zombie movie. Some scenes are superb like the opening scene where Anna (Sarah Polley) wakes up in the decrepit, crumbling world where society is falling apart with the zombie infestation and the great shots of how huge the zombie population has grown.. The movie does get into a good rhythm with enough character building and action sequences for the audience to care about who lives and who dies. IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't turn off when the credits roll because the movie keeps going. The final scene of the movie sticks to the back of your mind after watching, leaving your imagination to do the rest.I haven't seen the original 1978 Dawn Of The Dead, but I loved this rendition.

It is also probably one Zach Snyder's better movie's, considering his made some terrible one's recently. But again it does not live up to it's name, having some pretty bad characters who were obviously going to die from the start. It also lacks the satire and acting from the original, but I expected that from the start. There is very good camera work in some scenes especially at the start.

859,rufio_vega,More Flaws Than You Can Shake a Dead Limb At,3,12 May 2005,"I'll make it simple. Both Snyder and Gunn managed to put together an action film with gore and flash. However, they didn't make a ZOMBIE film. They made a horror film that settles for the lowest common denominator. Sadly, this is the modern trend for nearly any horror film created by a Hollywood company (remake or original).To avoid looking like a simple basher, I would like to start out by saying that the tandem did do a few interesting things. The special effects and the montage sequence at the beginning added much to the original story. I wouldn't be surprised if Romero would have loved to have added a similar montage to his original piece if he had the budget at the time to do so.Sadly, that's about all they did right. Snyder quickly took away the core emotion of the original, gutted it, and filled it with stuffing. This remake is something that had much potential with such a large budget and advancement in filming techniques. However, Gunn managed to write some of the worst pieces for a ZOMBIE film. This film was written in the manner of a body-count film. The characters are introduced on screen, we don't care much for any of them, and they are quickly exterminated in the flashiest manner possible. Gunn couldn't have given a damn about his characters, and Snyder did little to help by making the Zombies doped up on meth.Thus, instead of making a very character oriented film like Romero did back in the 70s, Snyder and Gunn created a plot-driven film. With such a take on a genre with more depth than any other in the horror branch of film, there's little interest left for the audience. Romero had 4 characters in his mall, and only these 4 characters had any real screen time. They bonded. They grew. The audience grows attached to the characters. These characters pushed forward the events of the film. However, Snyder managed to avoid this and go straight for the jugular. There was no character development. There was no attachment. All you had was a group of over TEN CHARACTERS on screen getting butchered one after the other. There was so much potential with the ORIGINAL group that Gunn had written into the mall at the beginning of the film, however, he opted to add more and more so he could kill them off. Character development and meaning were sacrificed, leaving a very hallow film with nothing but running corpses and explosions, and none of the creative flair Romero had written and directed.Take away the ""Dawn of the Dead"" name and all you have similar to the original is the mall and Tom Savini making a cameo. You won't care for the characters or the hell they are put through, as they aren't on the screen long enough for you to attach to them. Gunn shows his amateurish writing ability (which, oddly enough, gets you far in Hollywood) with this screenplay--then again, he wrote the second Scoobydoo film, so there is little shock there. Snyder did a decent job with the weak material he was given on paper. He could have done a much better job by directing focus to a small portion of the core group so we'd grow to care for these people. However, he too fell into the pathetic Hollywood style of bang over substance and gave us a flashy action (and body-count) film with corpses on meth.If you haven't watched this film, don't rush to see it. Watch the original, and await Romero's Land of the Dead this June. This is a forgettable film with an unforgettable heritage.",Dawn of the Dead
860,geocos1,Let's be serious!,2,29 May 2006,"For once I would like to watch a horror with real actors (such as From Dusk Till Dawn), not performed by the bottom line from Actors Studio! I'd like to say that making a movie is not all about having a big budget, good image, special effects, and a good cinematographer. Above all is about acting and directing.Don't get me wrong, I like to watch vampires flying around, but then please aloud me to ask why are they flying? (metaphor)There are so many things wrong with this movie, I really don't want to lose my time, or yours, with useless discussions. But trying to treat a unconscious (fat) women who looks like a triceratops in a world full of creatures that are killing, infecting and eating other people and then sticking a fork in her eyes ..makes me laugh for 2 sec, and then...get serious!And...please, for God's sake, let's not try do become poetic...""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"". If it is to be commercial, let it be commercial! This tag line is for another movie...I am shocked by this movie rating 7.3!! I hope my 2 will balance the things a bit. It may sound a bit harsh, it's possible that I didn't see enough stupid movie. It may not be the worse horror! :)But then... it's just my opinion!",Dawn of the Dead

It's a virus, zombies etc. Exactly as Resident Evil and many, many other movies. But the difference with this, and other movies, is that the story is very week. It's bad actors and boring music. The photo is OK but the rest is total crap. Don't see this ""horror"" movie, go and see the Ring 2 or any other movie who's much more of a story. I hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies. We have seen enough of that.

The storyline is almost the same compared to the film ""28 Days Later"" ( http://imdb.com/title/tt0289043/ ). Some new disease started to spread. Nobody knows what it exactly is, how does it spread, how to stop it. Few people comes together to some shopping mall and try to survive. And the ending is a bit pessimistic. (You must watch whole ending-titles to see whole end of their story!)So this film has more special effects compared to the 28 Days Later - explosions. It is more bloody, too. And main ""heroes"" kill undead by shooting them into theirs heads. Isn't the same killing method used in the ""Resident Evil""?

I love this movie i watched it at the theater, then of course ended up buying the DVD. I watched this movie every single day, i watched it so much that i ended up ruining it and had 2 buy another 1 LOL, but anyway, i knew word for word, line for line, and watch so much that i c and saw everything u could in a movie, noticed that littlest things in the movie that 1 wouldn't of seen at all unless u watched it over and over. I love George A Romero, he is a god in making zombie movies he is the man!!!! his dead series!!! the only movie that i didn't really cared for is Land of the dead!!! reason is that it wasn't nearly as good as dawn of the dead, Caz i was expecting something out of this world, compared 2 dawn of the dead i was like this movie is gonna blow DOD out of the water, which it didn't.I did like the fact the zombies in land of the dead could kinda talk well the black guy, and they had learned few things like moving and getting somewhere and actually fighting back with weapons!!! which was kinda cool, but Dawn of the dead is the greatest zombie movie EVER!!! in my opinion, not no1 Else's, so i don't want people 2 get the wrong idea, or argue with me saying no its not the best movie or the usual crap people say 2 others remember it my favorite movie and my best zombie movie of all time in my mind and my point of view!!!! thats all, i just love this movie!!! Sarah Polly makes a great lead in this movie!!! didn't mind her at all actually, compared 2 her other movies back in the day LOL. The ending when mike got bitten and didn't tell ne1 till the bitter end kinda sucked!!! They should of started the next movie with them, going 2 the island, and picking up from there!!!I think that would of been kinda neat having part#2 with the same characters and starting off the boat and walking towards the woods and finding a new breed of zombies!!! then end up figuring out where the virus came from the organs of it some how and just something like that!!! but oh well if u haven't seen this movie and r a zombie fen!!! watch this and if u hadn't already WTF u doing LOL, there is no boring parts or no break in the action, meaning the whole movie keeps u interested and wanting 2 watch it again and again!!!.Well thanks a lot and hope 2 watch plenty more zombie movies!!!!",Dawn of the Dead
866,enterfargo,transformations & reluctant zombies,9,9 June 2005,"I said before something about Andy's extra-fast transformation... focused mostly on the roof scene, something else occurred to me: just look on the fresh zombie's expression and gestures... I mean, at the beginning, after throwing down the bloody sign, Andy looks around for a few seconds, and it seems that he doesn't quite know what's he looking for, or what he's doing... in other words, he's disoriented... just like a new born animal, a deer cub who tries to get up on his feet, but without success, or anything similar... So, my theory is that Andy got bitten inside the shop, he also hyped inside (dvd extra), but he wasn't quite completely morphed... in the first minutes of zombie-being, the zombie/human has to overcome the new-born like sensation, this human to zombie violent transcendence.... What would be your reaction if a ultra-deadly virus will kill you, and you'll wake up with a fresh swiss-cheesed brain? I guess ""highly confused"" is the word(s) you're looking for, even if you wouldn't be able to think that much about the state you've just got into. That explains a lot of things: in the first minutes of the film, we witness how Anna's husband dies and wakes up as a zombie, and when he does, he wanders a bit around with a ""I don't know, who am I"" expression on his face... not to mention the little girl who's simply staring at the loving couple, without even trying to jump on them an kill them instantly... Another example... that new big fat lady zombie in the mall.. when she wakes up, she first stands still and tilts her head, without instantly harming the surrounding folk... In the end, even Steve the Zombie looks a bit at Anna like he's just waiting for her to say hello to him... That's a thought to think about... Not like the transformations in Resident Evil, or any other almost-cheesy zombie flicks, where the living wake up as perfect zombies (sometimes, the transformations happen when the dude's not even really dead... a some kind of lucid feet stand transformation of the living dead, loll :)) So, after all, Dr. Logan's desperate tries to educate Bub, in Day of the Dead, weren't so futile after all... I guess Dr. Logan would have succeeded in educating Bub, returning him to a more human-side, fact witch he partially did, if it weren't for that army clichéd, zombie sociopath freak... all in all, it's a form of racism, you know :) (reminds me of 'The Dead Next Door')... even the zombies have rights after all, huh? Why shouldn't they... it's not like they wanted to become zombies... If the remaining living want to blame someone for all the unnatural mayhem, they should blame the one who deserves it... none others than the creators (or creator) of the virus. But hey, if you put it that way, I guess the ones at NASA have to be blamed, since the true origin of this apocalyptic plague is that irradiated crashed satellite (NOTLD 68)... hell, you think they'll admit it? Noah... they don't even really admit that, even now, they're messin' up the ozone layer, with their rocket flights, fact which is 100% real, let me assure you. Another fact that bothers me is that everybody thinks that zombies are made of pure stupidity and cannibal instincts... That's not true... First of all, ask yourself these questions: why don't the zombies simply attack their kin? What drives them straight to the mall? What about their learning capacity? Is there really one? Of course it is... just watch how the zombies open Andy's door, just after the dog gets in... Or the zombie without legs, the one who mastered his climbing and hanging skills on the cellar pipes, beneath the mall, silently jumping on Bart... I say that's a trail of intelligence, after all... But I guess these guys will show their true scholar side (:)) in Land of the Dead... can't wait to see the movie! Funny I haven't sent it yet, isn't it? Well, what can I say... I'M FROM ROMANIA GODDAMIT! D'ya think that fresh made films just pop-out on our 2-star cinemas or on over-aged, almost communist TV sets? But what the heck... After all, I can consider myself lucky, you know... I'm among the few ones who manage to crop a few new good movies, once in a while... Hope that I'm not gonna wait too long to see Land of the Dead, though I heard the flick is in the can... or worse :)",Dawn of the Dead
867,Bigwillystyle,Good suspense thriller,7,30 May 2005,"There are good elements to this film and some bad ones. First of all, the bad ones. I think that some of the scenes were completely predictable and unrealistic, and the only reason the were put into the film was for the suspense effect. I believe that even the smallest flaw in a film, can ruin a film overall, and this film certainly had many of them. Despite these small flaws, the film had impressive elements like a creepy almost surreal atmosphere, that gave you the sense of what it's like to live in a nightmare. I enjoyed the consistency of the action, which kept me thrilled throughout the film. Overall the film was a good suspense thriller which could had been better if there had been a little more ambition.",Dawn of the Dead
868,jakethomas1997,Classic zombie movie to compare and relate all future movies to,8,4 October 2014,"Warning about minor spoilers:Dawn of the Dead is the most widely-recognized zombie film in my opinion, and everyone can agree that it has very important elements that we look for in an apocalyptic film. It has emotional loss, in-group tension, a temporary mall haven/playground, a stupid decision to try to leave, modified/armored vehicles, a gun store, and a crazy escape plan. Some things that could have been altered include saving a main character that got bit and chose to be left behind, the rather awful ending mixed with credits, the majority of the people dying, a better definition for what caused the outbreak, the use of amputation to save a life, slower walking or at least worse postured and unbalanced (uncoordinated) zombies, the desire for the zombies to eat any creature not just human, less of an unrealistic explosion with propane, and more. Overall this remake picks up and leaves alone some important aspects that the original covers, and the two movies make great buddies. The new one has many more thoughts in mind, while the old one is centralized in less locations.",Dawn of the Dead
869,georgklages,The best zombie movie I know!,9,27 November 2014,"I have seen the remake a year before the original movie. And I am a fan of remakes, if they are good. This remake is way better than the original, to be honest: It's my favorite zombie-movie. The makeup is great, the effects are good, the actors are good, the camera-work is good and even the actors of the original movie have cameos (not as their old roles of course). I think, ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 2004 is simply the best zombie movie I have seen yet, better than the George A. Romero's, better than ""28 days (and weeks) later"" and better than ""zombieland"" (but not funnier). The only thing that is not that awesome is the violence: It is very bloody sometimes.

With really unfitting and inappropriate comments, feelings and actions throughout the entire movie. I feel deeply sorry for Ving Rhames for being part of this movie.I think that this movie was completely ruined by its screenplay and does not deserve the high rating of 7.4. If it wasn't for the good effects and screen, I would have rated 1 point, although I think it deserves a 3 point thanks to the effects.The music is also of worst possible choice. It does simply not fit.It was a complete disappointment.If you enjoy zombie-movies, like I am Legend or World War Z, don't watch this movie. However, if you get turned on by gore, you might find one and another exciting scenes.All in all a terrible movie. Don't watch it.",Dawn of the Dead
871,thedeadwalk2nite,Just buy it and like it,10,30 December 2005,"Need I say more?I don't really see a lot of people barging into the boards and saying how much this movie sucks, and I agree with them. This movie is at the top of my list so far, right above Day of the Dead. Who cares about those slow, un-terrifying zombies that seem to take over the world oh so easily, when you can have faster, meaner, more fiercer running zombies that are able to smash through windows with one punch? I saw this movie the first day it came out, and I have to say I became obsessed with zombies once I saw this. It was so good, I went and saw it again about a week later.Sure it has its dull moments, its stupid moments, and those famous ""Let me have my own speech"" moments. But it's worth the watch. But I don't know why people don't like the plot as well as everything else. I mean, I guess they overlook the movie too much, and start concentrating on the plot. Please, don't do that. You will just ruin the movie for yourself.But I must say, the writer did pretty well for a remake, though it shouldn't really BE a remake, since it only has a few things that actually relate to the old Dawn of the Dead. The death scenes were great: a woman getting sliced by a chainsaw, little girls ripping skin and muscle out of guys neck...awesome. The actors are great too. Ving Rhames did a great job. I like his character because you barely see him laugh, he's always serious, and he doesn't seem to talk much, which you need in every zombie movie, must I say. Then there's the stupid one, Nicole, where they get everyone killed. Please, for God's sake, it's a dog! Well I guess it had to keep the movie going. And then you have to smart allick, Steve, where all he does is push everyone out of his way, and barely helps, no matter what happens. Whatever you do, don't trust him when he has to watch a door...Now go buy the movie, watch it, and like it. Promise me, it's worth the $24.99, and it's worth the hour and a half.

872,Brianbroadaxe,It's a keeper vs a twitcher.,10,9 July 2005,"It's a solid zombie movie but with a twist: a cast you can actually care when they end up munched. All of the characters are much deeper than more or less any horror film I've seen. You actually feel sorry for Anna being an overworked nurse, Kenneth is just trying to get to his brother, Michael is just trying to stay alive, and Mekhi Phifer's character is just trying to become the husband and father he never had. Jack the playboy, is the group a$%^*&e and plays it perfectly.Don't get me wrong, there are things that wouldn't make a lot of sense in real life. Like why would a police officer have the shotgun from his cruiser but not his sidearm for which he'd doubtlessly have 50 or more rounds of ammo? Why not find every possible weapon and use them to kill as many zombies as possible? A gas pump that works without electricity? Minor things with minimal impact on the movie but just don't make sense either.All in all, I enjoy watching this flick frequently and just ordered the DVD of the original as well as the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" A little known fact about ""Night of the Living Dead"" is that the TV reporter (Bill Cardille) in the film actually did work for WIIC in Pittsburgh as the host for the Saturday late night horror double feature.",Dawn of the Dead

The zombies are fast and scary; finally, the way they should be. I don't know what the budget was like for this movie but the film looks great.

875,kjvpresents,I liked it,10,22 August 2005,"First....and this is in no way disrespectful of anyone who enjoyed the original Dawn of The Dead, but the original Dawn of The Dead is horrible. It was boring, it was stoopid, it was too slow, the dead didn't make any sense (I'll comment on that in a second) - and the main characters didn't seem to know what they wanted to focus on.One moment they are scared, the next happy and comical, then sad, then ...it was just all over the place and I am sooo glad they didn't try and stick to the original.Now....this re-make of DOTD rocks. It's just that plain and simple. Sure it is a zombie movie - but the real story plays out in what goes on between the survivors. There are a lot of hills and dips and stuff that goes on in the movie. Sure some things don't make sense of what the people are doing - but that is exactly the point. How are you suppose to make sense when your world has turned upside down.Now the zombies on the other hand - in this version, they only did one thing. They tried to get ""food"". That's it. That's all they could do. They followed instinct.In the original, one of the dumbest things that could have possibly happened was to see the zombies staggering around the mall..and then all of a sudden one of the Hairy Krishner one's get's the bright idea to turn around and see what's going on down the other hall.They don't think like that. Duh. Okay, maybe if the dead person was a store detective or something...but certainly not a Hairy Krishner. So, I have absolutely no problems with the zombies running. None what so ever. If they can have a Hairy Krishner get zombie smart in a boring dead movie....then zombies can run.But think about it logically for a second. The zombies are ""Freshly Dead"". Not in the ground rotting for century dead. But freshly reanimated dead people. They should and would be able to move as fast as they would have when they were alive.That is to say - if they were a big fat tub of lard when they were alive, they aren't gonna move like ... oh wait - nevermind that thought.

As an aficionado of the Zombie genre, I too was extremely excited to see this film released. But I don't think I have ever been quite so disappointed.The original doesn't need me to describe how incredible it was. I regard it as one of my favourite films in any genre, and certainly the finest horror film ever made. In this big-budget remake they seem to have forgotten the entire premise of zombie films, and just gone all out for action.The acting and dialogue is terrible. The 'civilians' react to events rather more competently than the troops and police do in the first film, the zombies are badly made up, too fast, and overly intelligent, and there is little sense of atmosphere throughout the whole film. The post-credits handy-cam clip is perhaps the only redeeming moment of originality, but too little, too late.They even tried to use a pregnant zombie/zombie baby for shock value (See Peter Jackson's BrainDead), and they only succeeded in ruined the film further, adding an unnecessary (and probably unintentional) comedy scene.Don't waste your time on this: spend the saved money on some alcohol and watch the original again.",Dawn of the Dead

However, I have been saddened by the lack of decent horror flicks. Most of them have been mediocre at best. But now, here comes the dawn of a horror movie that is, dare i say it, AMAZING!!!!! The casting of mostly unknown stars was ideal for this movie and served the plot better than if Uma Thurman or Nicole Kidman played the leading lady. Instead, this is an ensemble driven movie, which it should feel like if survivors are uniting together against the undead. I actually felt compassion towards each and every character. The script was impeccable and the direction even better. The acting of all the unknown stars was fabulous and I LOVED the roles of Ana and that cynical guy with the boat ( I forgot his name). All of the situations felt so fresh and it never felt like I was watching a remake. The cinematography blew me away and some of the most intimate shots used with zombies actually added another dynamic to the static and boring character of a zombie. My only real gripe was that the whole Grandma showdown thing felt a little too ""wild west"" for me and that after the opening sequence and titles, the whole movie started off very slowly, which was strange considering there was a whole outbreak of zombies. other than that, i thought that this movie was awesome.

Why on earth would they go to a mall to escape? There would be so many ways the zombies could get in. And shatterproof glass? Seriously? What were the odds? The mall's too big a place with different levels - what made them think that they could cover every single exit? 
And going to a boat was their best way out? Seriously? It could've been a concrete plan if it was explained to us clearly. But no all we know was that Steve had this boat and they were going to reinforce two buses as if they were all suddenly handymen and drive out to it to go to some random island they didn't even know exist.Then there's the zombies. My god were they almost hilarious. I had no idea if the movie was going for a comedic direction because it sure as hell seemed like it.

It was fun learning the movie from Andy's point of view. I hope there is going to be a part two because I know that at least one person had to survive. Or at least I hope!
