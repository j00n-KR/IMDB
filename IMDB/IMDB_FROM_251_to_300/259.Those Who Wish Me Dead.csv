0,SnoopyStyle,unremarkable thriller,6,20 May 2021,"Forensic accountant Owen Casserly goes on the run with his young son Connor. His D. A. colleague has been murdered by an assassin team, Jack (Aidan Gillen) and Patrick Blackwell (Nicholas Hoult). He had uncovered high-powered political corruption. With no one to trust, he heads off to small town Montana where his brother-in-law Ethan Sawyer (Jon Bernthal) is a Deputy Sheriff. The assassin team catches up to him before that. His son Connor escapes and finds help from smokejumper Hannah Faber (Angelina Jolie).In the old days, this would be a mid-level thriller which would come in and be forgotten in a week. Nowadays, it's a mid-level thriller on streaming that is soon forgotten after being released. It's a functional movie. It has a bit too much on Hannah's past trauma. She needs to connect with Connor a bit sooner. Pregnant Rambo is pretty dope. The good news is that most of the characters are pretty smart. There are no overtly stupid moves from these people. Even stupid moves have reasonable excuses. It's ok. Watch it and forget it.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
1,classicsoncall,"""You got to win one, I see.""",7,18 May 2021,"Against a backdrop of a huge forest fire, Forest Ranger Hannah (Angelina Jolie) attempts to lead a young boy (Finn Little) to safety after his father was murdered by a pair of brother hitmen. The premise for that murder was never made clear, only that the target was a forensic accountant who turned up something incriminating enough to warrant a hit on him and his employer as well. At the same time, Jolie's character suffers a guilt riddled angst over the deaths of three teenagers who perished in a separate fire when she miscalculated on the direction of the conflagration. Tied into the story is a small town sheriff (Jon Bernthal) and his pregnant wife, a survivalist who knows how to handle herself when the assassins come calling. The unseen stars of this vehicle were the special effects team who made the forest fire behave like a killer in and of itself, leaping across expanses of forest and river in a furious spectacle. Considering the nature of the story, the name of the film doesn't quite capture the essence of what occurred along the way, since the 'Me' in the title seems to refer to Jolie's character, who became an equal opportunity target of the vicious assassins only when she took the young boy Connor under her wing.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
2,jboothmillard,Those Who Wish Me Dead,6,31 May 2021,"I didn't see any trailers or images of this film before seeing, I just literally heard who the leading actress was and that it had something to do with a firefighter, so I looked forward to being surprised and hopefully entertained. Basically, Hannah Faber (Angelina Jolie) is a smokejumper (a wildland firefighter) who is haunted by the tragic memory of failing to save three young campers and a fellow smokejumper who all got trapped and died in a forest fire a year ago. She is now posted in a fire lookout tower in Park County, Montana. Meanwhile, forensic accountant Owen Casserly (Jake Weber) sees on the news that his boss and his family have been killed in an apparent gas explosion. In fact, they were murdered by assassins the Blackwell brothers, Jack (Aidan Gillen) and Patrick (Nicholas Hoult). Believing he is next to be targeted, Owen goes on the run with his son, Connor (Finn Little), to hide with his brother-in-law, Deputy Sheriff Ethan Sawyer (Jon Bernthal), also Hannah's ex-boyfriend. Driving to Ethan's cabin, Owen and Connor are ambushed by the Blackwells, who force them off the road and down a cliff. Owen is gravely injured, he gives Connor evidence against the Blackwells' employer, mob boss Arthur Phillip (Tyler Perry). He tells Connor to give it to someone he can trust, Connor escapes the crashed car before the assassins shoot his father dead. Ethan discovers Owen's car wreck. Meanwhile, Hannah is forced to abandon the watch tower during an electrical storm, she is lucky to escape before lightning strikes the power. The following day, she stumbles upon Connor while walking through the woods. Connor is reluctant to trust Hannah, but she convinces him to accompany her back to the tower to contact help. Arthur has heard the reports about Owen being killed, but nothing about the boy, he instructs the Blackwells to hunt Connor down and kill him. To distract the police from searching for them, the assassins use flares to ignite a forest fire. They go to Ethan's house believing Connor may have fled there. There they find and interrogate Ethan's pregnant wife, Allison (Medina Senghore), but she fights them off and escapes. Returning to the tower, Hannah finds the radio and all power has been disabled by the lightning strike. Connor feels he can trust Hannah and shows her the evidence he was given by his father, and she insists that must head to town on foot. The storm continues while they are crossing a field, during which Hannah survives but is injured being struck by lightning. They are forced to turn back seeing the increasing fire ahead blocking their path. Ethan returns home with the Sheriff (Boots Southerland) after having been alerted by Allison in a call that something is wrong. The Blackwells kill the Sheriff and force Ethan to guide them through the woods. The Blackwells and Ethan reach Hannah's tower. Ethan is forced into climbing up to it and searching while the Blackwells watch from a tree. Having returned to the tower, Hannah and Connor hide while Ethan attempts to make it appear empty. However, Patrick sees Ethan talking through his rifle telescope, and the assassins start shooting into the tower, injuring Ethan. Hannah and Connor manage to escape. The Blackwells try to follow them but are stopped when Allison, having tracked them down, starts shooting at them. Patrick and Jack split up, with Patrick going after Hannah and Connor. Jack stays and tries to kill Allison, but she kills him. Connor runs ahead while Hannah distracts Patrick, but seeing Patrick beating Hannah he runs back to help her. Patrick approaches Connor to kill him, but Hannah struggles with him, until he is severely injured. The blaze is quickly moving through the forest, so Patrick is left to burn to death in the approaching fire. Allison reunites with Ethan at the top of the tower, but they are trapped by the fire. They put on oxygen masks and hold each other as it surrounds them. Hannah and Connor jump into a river and watch from under the water as the fire engulfs the forest. The following morning, after the fire has burned out, the survivors are saved when Hannah's old smoke-jumping team arrives to rescue her and Connor. Meanwhile, Allison survived, but Ethan died from his earlier injuries. Later, Connor prepares to give his father's evidence to the media and Hannah promises to help him through his uncertain future. Also starring James Jordan as Ben and Tory Kittles as Ryan. Jolie gives an interesting performance as the somewhat flawed but reliable firefighter, Gillen and Hoult are impressive as the sinister killers, Little is a rising talent, and there is good support from Bernthal and Senghore. It is a very simplistic story, a father and son on the run, killers hunting them down and a woman drawn into helping the boy whilst also tackling fires, but you are drawn into it by its characters and its tense moments, a worthwhile action thriller. Good!",Those Who Wish Me Dead
3,paul_haakonsen,A fair enough thriller...,6,11 July 2021,"I sat down to watch the 2021 movie ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" here in 2021 as I was sort of made to do so, given the fact that my wife wanted to watch it. So I buckled in and went to watch it with her.Granted, I wasn't really expecting much of anything grand here from writers Michael Koryta, Charles Leavitt and Taylor Sheridan. So I would say that director Taylor Sheridan definitely had all the chances to impress me with ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"".And let me just say that ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" was actually an adequately entertaining and enjoyable movie. It had that particular classic thriller sense to it that made movies had back in the 1980s. So that definitely worked out for me.The storyline in the movie was good. Sure, this wasn't exactly rocket science, but the script provided me with adequate entertainment and enough suspense to keep it interesting.""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" had a good ensemble of actors and actresses to help bring the movie to life on the screen, with the likes of Angelina Jolie, Jon Bernthal, Aidan Gillen and Nicholas Hoult.Visually then ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" was fairly good. However, the scene with the rapidly spreading fire in the forest was just a bit over the top. Now, I am by no means traversed in the science of forest fires, but the speed that the fire spread with just seemed way too impossible. Sure, it made for intense entertainment, but...While ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" definitely was watchable, the movie just doesn't really have the contents to support more than just a single viewing, as the storyline just doesn't carry the leverage for such. And this movie is hardly one that left me impressed, and I believe that it is one that will slowly fade into oblivion among a sea of other similar movies.Ultimately, then I am rating ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" a six out of ten stars.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
4,zardoz-13,A Fair to Middling Angeline Jolie thriller,5,25 May 2021,"Good movies surprise you early and often because you're not prepared for their revelations. In a run-of-the-mill movie, you can guess what's going to happen before it occurs. Superficial films spend more time bluffing audiences than fulfilling their lame threats. ""Wind River"" director Tyler Sheridan's fair to middling Angeline Jolie thriller ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" qualifies as a contrived, profane, R-rated actioneer. Sheridan and his scribes conjure up some clever ideas, but never enough to offset their predictable plotting. Furthermore, filmmakers who resort to events too horrible to imagine take unfair advantage of their audiences. When was the last time you saw an innocent child in a movie get shot to ribbons? Theatrical films can bluff you into believing the villains will shoot the kid, unless the urchin dies off screen. Nevertheless, audiences don't look at a movie the same after a child has been murdered. Straight-to-video releases garner more leeway in their depiction of these taboos. Moreover, when have you seen a thug threaten a pregnant woman with a red-hot poker fresh from a blazing fireplace? Nobody is going to blind an expectant mom. Instead, filmmakers hope you'll either shut your eyes or look away. ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" relies on these cynical storytelling tactics. Sheridan and company confront audiences with several repugnant predicaments. Occasionally, to maintain a palatable threat level, the filmmakers sacrifice peripheral characters. When an amenable motorist stops to offer an injured assassin help, the guy guns her down and then carjacks her vehicle!Angelina Jolie is cast as Hannah, a veteran Montana forest service firefighter & smoke jumper. She has a team like those that Josh Brolin led in ""Only the Brave"" (2017) who battle forest fires with guts and shovels. She is the token female, but her brawny colleagues treat her with respect and dignity. She has proven herself as one who can supervise a crew under the worse circumstances. Infallible, however, she is not. The accidental deaths of three teenagers in a fickle forest fire haunts her. The winds fueling the inferno abruptly shifted directions on her crew. Suffice to say, Hannah lost a man, and then spotted three teenagers fleeing from the blaze. She compounded her mistake when her own fear paralyzed her. She couldn't bring herself to plunge into certain death to rescue the boys. Teens stumbling through burning woods on the spur of the moment stretches credibility. None of her crew agreed with the findings of a Forest Service inquiry. As punishment, Hannah is relieved of duty and reassigned temporarily to sit in a fire tower for the summer.Nevertheless, Hannah holds herself personally responsible for their demise, and the horrific memory eats away at her soul. She does everything she can to bolster her courage. She defies common sense and takes all kinds of risks. When we first see her, she buckles herself into a parachute harness and rides in the bed of a careening pick-up truck swerving along a forest road. As the truck gathers speed, she pulls her ripcord, and the chute catapults her backwards out of the vehicle into the sky. Although she lands safely in the woods, her ex-boyfriend, Deputy Sheriff Ethan Sawyer (Jon Bernthal of ""Baby Driver""), claps her in cuffs and takes her home. Ethan doesn't charge Hannah with any crime, but he reprimands her for her foolish behavior.Meantime, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, two ruthless assassins, Jack (Aiden Gillen of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"") and Patrick (Nicholas Hoult of ""X-Men: Apocalypse""), posing as a fire department inspector and a gas lineman, show up at the house of the local District Attorney and warn his wife about a potential gas leak. She lets them inside. Afterward, when they leave the residence, Jack spots a speck of blood on Patrick's shirt and suggests he change it. Moments later, while they are walking away, the house disintegrates in a sudden explosion that kills everybody inside and destroys any evidence of mischief. They set off for Jacksonville, Florida, to kill their second suspect. Jack criticizes their shortsighted superiors who should have assigned another team to take care of the Jacksonville target.About six hours away in Jacksonville, a bespectacled forensic accountant, Owen (Jake Weber of ""Midway""), is their next target. He is about to drive his son, Conner (Finn Little of ""Storm Boy""), to school. Owen's wife died from cancer, so he is a single dad. Owen catches a breaking news segment about a mysterious, Fort Lauderdale, gas explosion. Paranoia gnaws away at him, and Owen piles a reluctant Conner into their VW sedan and races off for Montana. He plans to hole up with his deputy sheriff brother-in-law Ethan Sawyer and Ethan's African American wife Allison (Medina Senghore of ""Clonehunter""). The cunning assassins ambush Owen near the Sawyer's house and turn the VW into a colander. Mortally wounded, Owen crashes through a guard rail and the VW plunges down a steep incline. The assassins pour another fusillade of gunfire into the vehicle. Afterward, they masquerade as FBI agents. To keep the local authorities occupied, Jack ignites a forest fire with three flares heaved into a wooded area near a rest stop.Writer & director Tyler Sheridan and scenarist Michael Koryta, who adapted his own novel, along with ""Blood Diamond"" scribe Charles Leavitt, never specify the heinous crimes of those who hired Jack and Patrick. We're told this prominent investigation could topple several VIPs. Tyler Perry has a cameo as a corrupt government official who relays orders to these ruffians. Although the hitmen are reptilian, they're also slipshod. Meanwhile, not only must Hannah help Connor elude these dastards, but she also must conquer her own fears about her ability to keep Connor alive. They must dodge wicked bolts of lightning as well as evade the inferno. Our heroine Hannah earns her stripes all over again with a variety of cuts, bruises, and burns throughout this mayhem. Altogether, ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" amounts to half-baked B-movie riddled with hackneyed cliches.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
5,Calicodreamin,Well made movie,8,16 May 2021,"A well made and well rounded movie. The characters were well cast and well acted. A good mix of action, heartfelt moments, and a few comedic lines delivered just right. Loved Jolie's character and the kid did an amazing job.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
6,neil-476,"Yes, but what was the point?",6,3 June 2021,"When his father is killed while fleeing from hitmen, young Connor flees into the forest where he falls in with Hannah, a firefighter whose mojo was injured during a forest fire tragedy. Together they must escape not only the hitmen but also the firest fire they started.Welcome to another curate's egg. Angelina Jolie's Hannah is a tolerable second banana supporting Finn Little as the newly orphaned evidence-bearing Connor. This kid is seriously good, by far the best thing in the film. The plot idea is fine, the danger is plausible, the actions of the improbably Amazonian deupty's wife are nlikely but satisfying, and most of what happens is unoriginal but tolerable.But the film is built on the threat of the hitmen and Connor and his Dad fleeing them - some effort and time is devoted to setting this up. And then two things happen. One, the hitmen go from being murderously efficient to bumblingly inept. And, two, there is never any real oayoff as regards the maguffin which thrus Connor inharm's way in the first place - without even knowing why and who, you are left to assume that Connor's crumpled and soaked bits of paper will remove him from jeopardy. This is careless screenwriting and devalues the fil significantly, adding a note of dissatisfaction to an otherwise adequate action thriller.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
7,ferguson-6,if not for AJ ...,5,17 May 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Taylor Sheridan was Oscar nominated for his screenplay of the superb HELL OR HIGH WATER (2016). He also wrote and directed WIND RIVER (2017), wrote the screenplays for both SICARIO movies, and is the creative force behind the TV series ""Yellowstone"". He has excelled in generating slow-burn tension and conflict. For his latest film, he's back in the director's chair after co-writing the script with Charles Leavitt (BLOOD DIAMOND, 2006) and the 2014 novel's author, Michael Koryta.Oscar winner Angelina Jolie stars as Hannah, a thrill-seeking smokejumper (those folks who jump out of airplanes to fight fires and save lives) burdened with a faulty decision that cost lives in a massive forest fire the previous year. After flunking her psyche-evaluation, Hannah packs up the blame and her flashbacks and accepts her low-key assignment to the solitude of ""Fire Tower"", a lookout perched above the tree line of Soda Butte, a park area within Yellowstone that encompasses the Continental Divide. Early on we see the camaraderie of the smokejumpers as they tease each other and ""welcome"" the new firefighters to the park.In a seemingly unrelated storyline (although we know the intersection is coming), Owen (Jake Weber, ""Medium"") and his son Connor (Finn Little) take an emergency detour on the way to school. Owen is a forensic accountant who uncovered some corruption while working for a Florida DA who was recently murdered by the same hitmen now chasing Owen and his son. Soon, Connor is wandering alone through the forest looking for someone he can trust, and up pops Hannah. The pair of calm-cool-collected hitmen are played by Aidan Gillen (""Game of Thrones"") and Nicholas Hoult (MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, 2015). They track down Owen's brother-in-law Ethan (Jon Bernthal, BABY DRIVER, 2017), who happens to work for the sheriff's department in the same park.Whether you call it a hunt or a chase, it's always a bit creepy when professional hitmen are tracking down an innocent kid, and the tension is elevated when we see the bad guys take their direction from a higher-up bad buy played by Tyler Perry in one brief scene. The film features a hand full of excellent action sequences, including a shootout between the hitmen and Ethan's pregnant wife Allison (Medina Senghore). Conveniently, Allison runs a survivor camp, and despite her belly, manages to put up quite a fight.Cinematographer Ben Richardson (BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD, 2012) capitalizes on the extraordinary vastness and beauty of Soda Butte, and some of the forest fire effects are so good we can almost feel the heat. The supporting cast is excellent and the multiple story lines all work together nicely. For me, what prevented the film from reaching the level it could have, was the presence and performance of Angelina Jolie. Her last action movie was SALT in 2010, and here she seems too concerned with a look of glamor - right down to consistently brushed hair and perfect make-up - than fitting the profile of the courageous (and slightly off-center) smokejumpers. She stands out from the others on the team not because of her inherent extreme risk-taking, but rather because of her magazine-cover approach - something not limited to the hair and make-up, but also her posing and preening, including many of the same gazes from other movies like GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS (2000). I often admire and respect the choices actors make, but in this case, those choices work against everything else in what could have been an excellent dramatic thriller.Now available on HBO Max.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
8,morrison-dylan-fan,Backdraft.,7,2 June 2021,"After the live wire of Spiral (2021-also reviewed) became my first return viewing to the cinema,a friend told me she had picked this title for her return visit,and had enjoyed it. Intrigued by the details she shared,I got set to discover who wishes death.View on the film:Originally hired to re-write Charles Leavitt & Michael Koryta's adaptation of Koryta's own novel,until he cut a deal with the studio,where if he got the lead actress to sign on,he could direct it.Whilst taking some fairly large leaps in logic, (not one person chokes on smoke from the fire) directing auteur Taylor Sheridan reunites with Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012-also reviewed) cinematographer Ben Richardson for a scotching hot slick Thriller atmosphere of jagged whip-pans on the bare knuckle violence unleashed by the two assassins,that Sheridan rolls out to a blazing final, where the air is filled with ash from the fire, and the bright orange reflects Hannah's burning passion to save Connor.Igniting a huge forest fire which destroys the landscape, Sheridan makes a great mark on the original script, via continuing to expand the themes of his Frontier trilogy, via the destruction by man of the Neo- Western new frontier desolate forest location,where outlaw Hannah hides whilst being haunted by the past, until she crosses paths with Connor,who brings the chance to find an opportunity to make amends.Joined in the woods by delightfully snarling,pulpy turns from Nicholas Hoult & Aidan Gillen as the boo-hiss baddies, Angelina Jolie gives a sizzling turn as Hannah, whose withdrawn state is burnt by Jolie into a battle warrior,as she takes on those who wish Connor dead.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

10,Cineanalyst,Fiery Popcorn Popper,5,15 May 2021,"If one wants to turn off their brain, as they say, for an hour and a half and gawk at eye candy in the form of forest-fire effects, shoot-'em-up action and a firefighter advertisement, a readily recognizable star amidst (in this case, Angelina Jolie), while, perhaps, stuffing one's face full of junk food, you could do worse than ""Those Who Wish Me Dead."" For featuring a protagonist who's on the edge from flashback trauma, this one plays it by the formulaic book of these popcorn flicks. That simplistic redemption arch itself is a trope, after all. A couple things to like about this one, though, is that it doesn't waste too much time on the baddies' conspiracy that initiates the action. It's just a plot device; the filmmakers were right to assume nobody actually cares about its details or to linger on its resolution. It's also rated R, so there's no ridiculous avoidance of a bit of blood or colorful language.On the other hand, we are being treated with kid gloves here much like the boy that Jolie and the rest of the heroes are out to protect. We're only told what we need to know, and for the most part we rigidly follow directions on where to go and what to do. The only difference in treatment between the audience and the child seems to be that we get to see Jolie in her bra as she changes shirts. Kind of insulting if you think about it, but thinking about it would defeat the purpose.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

It was well acted and pretty solidly directed movie. The R rating was well deserved and it helped this movie.

Apart from that, there really was nothing here to make this a memorable viewing experience. We have a Dad on the run from assassins because he stumbled upon information he's not suppose to have and now they want him dead, but not enough information is given on what information exactly he possesses. I thought it might be revealed later, but alas, they never did. On the run with him, is his son Connor.None of the characters are fleshed out. The only one with a bit of a back story, is Hannah (Jolie) - the film's heroin - but even her back story feels forced, and her memories become pretty much deja vu. The best character by far, was Allison (played by Medina Senghore). She made the best decisions and came across as the strongest character. All the other characters made strange and unrealistic decisions throughout the movie.This movie could have gone in so many directions, but instead it was just plodding along, with the fire making it more interesting. The visual effects were fine. The climax felt a bit rushed and nothing spectacular. I doubt I'm going to remember this movie after a while - and honestly, I won't even miss it.

It had some plot twists that made it even more interesting and contained nice differences and good character development.

17,cruise01,Decent thriller with a forgettable story and dull action.,6,23 May 2021,3 out of 5 starsDecent action. Boring story. And acting that seems tedious. Makes this a fair action thriller.,Those Who Wish Me Dead
18,eddie_baggins,A mid-tier thriller from a writer/director we've come to expect more from,5,17 May 2021,"Considering his responsible for penning the scripts for Sicario, Hell or High Water, creating the hugely popular Yellowstone series and was both writer and director of the highly undervalued but well-regarded Wind River, Taylor Sheridan has a quickly built reputation in the minds of film fans and its a reputation that doesn't get upheld with his latest thriller Those Who Wish Me Dead.A film that in many ways feels like an old-school late 80's/early 90's action thriller, the type that littered the marketplace wherever you looked in that time and place, Dead sees Sheridan adapt Michael Koryta's well-liked booked on which this film is based on and while it remains somewhat faithful to its source material, you wonder why Sheridan was so excited to bring this to the big screen as it has none of the depth, character development or spectacle that worked so well in his most popular big screen works.There's very little depth on show here, Dead is the type of thriller that fails to work any particular messaging or social relevance into its story, its just a straight up tale of Angelina Jolie's traumatised but hard as nails Montana based firefighter Hannah helping Finn Little's young boy Conner escape the clutches of a murderous group of hitman who need him dead after he witnessed the killing of his father, with the only unique element to this tale being that this all transpires while a deliberately lit wild-fire rampages through the pristine surrounds of their location.With so little for us to hold onto regarding backstories or reasons for caring, Sheridan unfortunately doesn't manage to get much of a spark happening between Hannah and Conner and while Jolie and Australian actor Little do decent enough jobs in their roles, the friendship between the mismatched duo isn't strong enough to carry the film to another level with all the fun and excitement left to the work of Aidan Gillen (is he the best bad guy character actor around right now?) and Nicolas Hoult as the two cold blooded hitman on his tail and Jon Bernthal as kind-hearted local sheriff Ethan.As has been the case with Sheridan's previous work as a writer and director, Dead does harbor some fairly tense and well-executed set pieces that while paling in significance to the finales of Sicario, Hell or High Water or Wind River, some scenes do feel like sequences that are of a higher class than your average run of the mill mid-budgeted thriller but it just makes you feel more disappointed that these moments aren't part of a greater whole and that Sheridan won't continue too lower his colors for efforts like this that while not terrible, are so middle of the road that you wonder why he would even bother?Final Say -A fairly mundane effort from a writer/director that we've rightfully come to expect a lot more of, Those Who Wish Me Dead isn't a film that becomes the talent of Taylor Sheridan or its cast that includes a welcome return to leading role duties for Angelina Jolie. Far from horrible, this is also a film that fails to ignite any real reason to seek it out.2 1/2 watch towers out of 5.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

We then go to ""Fort Lauderdale, FL"", as two guys pretend to be with the local gas and power company and gain entrance to a house, which explodes in due course, killing everyone inside ( we later learn: the local District Attorney and his family). We then go to ""Jacksonville, FL"", where a guy and his young son are having breakfast. The guy sees the news report about the suspicious gas explosion in Ft. Lauderdale... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from erstwhile actor turned screenwriter turned director Taylor Sheridan. From the moment he turned in his first script, 2015's outstanding ""Sicario"", I've been a huge fan. He followed that with the script for 2016's ""Hell or High Water"", for which he received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, and deservedly so. His directing debut with 2017's ""Wind River"" was pretty good too. Imagine then my surprise when he scripted the below par ""Without Remorse"" (a Tom Clancy adaptation) released earlier this year. Now comes ""Those Who Wish Me Dead', a kinda-sorta action/crime drama set in the context of looming forest fires in Montana. Let me state upfront that I had no idea this film was a Taylor Sheridan production until the end credits rolled, and to say that I was taken aback when I saw his name, would be the understatement of the year. The movie's plot is strictly generic, filled with implausible coincidences yet utterly predictable. The script is borderline laughable, with immortal lines line ""Are you someone I can trust?"" (by the young boy to the Angelina Jolie character). Angelina Jolie makes her comeback as a kick-ass action heroine reminiscent of Lara Croft, except that now 20 years later, this feels way, way off (and of course she isn't helped by the weak script). The forest fire scenes look impressive to a degree, but all I can think while watching it was ""I sure hope no trees were hurt in the making of this film"". Bottom line, this is Hollywood at its very blandest, and I'm being mild. And whatever has become of the Taylor Sheridan of ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water""? Please return that guy to us!""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" was made 2 years ago, and then of course fell victim to a little thing called COVID-19, and hence pushed back from an original 2020 theater release. It finally was released in US theaters 2 weeks ago, while also streaming on HBO Max (where I caught it). If you are a fan of Taylor Sheridan or of Angelina Jolie, I'd suggest you check this out, with limited expectations, and draw your own conclusion.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
22,jtindahouse,Decent but not near Sheridan's best,7,17 May 2021,"Taylor Sheridan has had a pretty crazy good start to his young career. Pretty much everything he has written, and in the case of 'Wind River' directed as well, has turned to gold. I knew he had directed and written 'Those Who Wish Me Dead' as I was watching it, but it didn't feel exactly like his other work. It felt like someone else's works with little inputs of his own along the way. Sure enough I found out afterwards that this was him taking someone else's script and tweaking it. The movie is still pretty good, but it isn't up to the level of other things he has put his name to.It feels like forever since I have watched a movie with Angelina Jolie in it. Back in the 2000s she was the biggest name in Hollywood and was releasing multiple films every year. These days we are lucky if we get one every few years out of her. I'd forgotten how much natural charm and charisma she has. Not to mention that she still looks pretty good for 45. The whole cast in this movie are pretty good. There aren't a lot of huge names among them but they all hold their own and play their part well.The villains in this movie were inconsistent. I loved the opening scene they were given. It set the standard for them really well and gave a sense of the stakes the movie was going to be played at. From there though they varied from extremely capable to borderline incompetent. When they were good they were great, however when they weren't they might as well have been in a 'Home Alone' movie.I mostly enjoyed this one. The ending played out a little bit too unexpectedly for my liking and there were some less than inspiring sequences. Jolie was good though and there were some sequences that were reasonably memorable as well. Overall though I don't feel this film had enough to stick in my mind for long. It's worth a look, but don't go in expecting Sheridan's best work. 7/10.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
23,stevendbeard,Mediocre Drama,6,17 May 2021,"I saw ""Those Who Wish Me dead"", starring Angelina Jolie-the Maleficent movies, Pushing Tin; Finn Little-Angel of Mine, Storm Boy; Jon Bernthal-The Punisher_tv, Date Night and Nicholas Hoult-the X_Men movies, Clash of the Titans_2010.This is a mediocre drama about a teenager on the run from killers during a forest fire. Finn, the teen, escapes a trap that was meant to kill him and his father-an accountant-and heads into a Montana forest where he runs into Angelina, a firefighter. Angelina tries to help Finn but Nicholas-one of the bad guys-and his partner are in hot pursuit after setting a forest fire as a distraction to cover their dirty deeds. Jon is a sheriff that is looking for Finn and Angelina. There is a cameo by Tyler Perry as the boss that wants Nicholas and his partner to get the job done.It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.It's a pretty run of the mill action drama so I wouldn't buy it on DVD-one viewing was enough-but it would be alright as a rental, if you are a fan of Angelina.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
24,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Those Who Wish Me Dead,4,28 June 2021,4/10 - I'm surprised at how well this movie was received given that it felt like everyone from the writers to the director and most of the cast phoned it in.,Those Who Wish Me Dead
25,robfollower,Absolutely an underrated hidden gem .,9,29 May 2021,"Those Who Wish Me Dead is an action/thriller/disaster movie starring Angelina Jolie as Hannah, a brave smokejumper who must protect a young boy from ruthless assassins in the Montana wilderness.A boy watches his father murdered over a secret he knows, and he must escape the assassins himself after they discover he is missing. Angelina Jolie tasked with protecting him is a firefighter stationed in a fire tower and dealing with past trauma.A Stellar cast and a great child actor (Finn Little) elevate this action thriller to more than the sum of its parts. Great moments that will have you cheering and on the edge of your seat. Great direction and some beautiful cinematography. I have not seen Angelina Jolie in a singular action role in over 10 years very refreshing to see her in action once again. Apparently Angelina Jolie did most of the stunts in the film and they were not easy to execute.It would be an understatement to say that Angelina Jolie is put through the wringer in writer-director Taylor Sheridan's new film "" Those Who Wish Me Dead.""She is beaten and bruised by nature, men and even some of her own choices -- like a crazy stunt involving a parachute and a pickup truck. Jolie has always thrown herself into physically demanding roles, but her Montana firefighter Hannah Farber may take the cake for most cuts and shiners sustained in 24 hours. This is a film in which she's running from hitmen, raging forest fires and past traumas. Apparently her face and body are the physical representation of that. Even so, it's always a pleasure to see her back on screen, which has become rarer and rarer lately. I am a huge Jolie fan and she does not disappoint here.I went into this film blind and I was surprised by the amount of delicious violence and Gore. Expect some intense peril and violence: A boy and other children are in peril, and women are punched and treated roughly by men. Characters are burned in wildfires. There are guns and shooting, blood spatters, bloody wounds, and gory moments (including a dead body with a chunk of skull missing).Monumental edge-of-your-seat action, first rate character building of the onscreen bond between Angelina Jolie and Finn Little that gets you emotionally invested in the events unfolding on screen.

It all looked fine with nice locations and good casting, but it was like I was watching the screenplay instead of a film. Focused on too many characters without really exploring any one of them, and setting up scenes simply for emotional or action queues.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
29,masonfisk,I DIDN'T LIKE THIS MOVIE WHEN HOWIE LONG WAS IN IT...!,6,20 May 2021,"Angelina Jolie stars in this recent action thriller release. Jolie is a former forest firefighter now relegated to cabin duty (where she has the vista of the forest beyond to serve as a smoke spotter). In recurring flashbacks, we see Jolie misjudged the wind during a firefight causing some of her colleagues to get killed which has now spurned her current devil may care attitude (she jumps off a moving pick-up, setting off a parachute) she's currently paying for. Into this Shangri-La comes a young boy played by Finn Little, on the run after his father, played by Jake Weber, is killed (he was a forensic accountant working on sensitive mob business) by a pair of hitmen, played by Aiden Gillen (Little Finger from Game of Thrones) & Nicholas Hoult (the current Beast from the X-Men series). Jolie has to care for Little & usher him to safety as the hitmen, aided by a lawman played by Jon Bernthal (who they have at gunpoint) approach her position as well as Bernthal's pregnant wife, played by Medina Senghore, also converges on Jolie's location. Will Jolie get over her past long enough to save her young charge as a rapidly approaching fire (which the bad guys set) takes them both out? What we have is a lot of A list talent, both in front of & behind the camera (this being co-writer/director Taylor Sheridan sophomore effort after his last assignment Wind River), working on serviceable B material which strangely enough doesn't use its own star much leaving Jolie to bring as much life as she can to an anemically written role (one that is cliché driven all the way) when the expecting couple seems to have been a far better choice to focus the proceedings on but as it is, the film works (the hitmen being no nonsense types helps), keeping the narrative as soberly constructed as possible. Also starring Tyler Perry as Gillen's contact & Tory Kittles as a fellow smoke eater.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

31,aidanratesmovies,Shallow and mistoned little action thriller with literally no purpose,2,15 May 2021,"An incredibly tedious, needlessly violent, and poorly compiled little action thriller- Those Who Wish Me Dead feels like a lost film that's been sitting on the shelf since the 90's- and honestly they should have kept it there. Angelina Jolie stars in this bizarre action thriller where she plays a smokejumper/firefighter character that is as generic as can be. She's your typical action heroiness, with a generic tragic backstory you won't care about for a moment. The film tries so hard to shove each characters pain down your throats, it's truly bizarre how you'll end up not caring about nearly a single one of them. The bad guys are as generic as can be, and the plot is never really explained- secret information is out there but we never quite learn what it is that's so important, and the film doesn't seem to really care- just as long as it finishes. Jon Bernthal and his characters wife played by Medina Senghore are perhaps the only remotely interesting characters throughout the film- but there presence is largely overshadowed and in the end rather pointless in the whole scheme of things. The film is weirdly violent for no reason, just trying to provide shocks from the audience without any true purpose. It just feels gross- it wants us to feel so bad that we sympathize with what is going on- but there is nothing to truly latch on and acre about. Some action scenes are entertaining, and I was intrigued at first by the plot, but in the end this film is just a huge mess and I don't think I'll remember it by the end of the day.My Rating: 1.6/10.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
32,masonsaul,Great thriller,8,21 May 2021,"Whilst the villiain's decision to set the forest on fire is a bit of a leap, Those Who Wish Me Dead is still a great thriller that's extremely tense, visceral and emotional. Angelina Jolie and Finn Little are both incredible. Jon Bernthal, Aidan Gillen, Nicholas Hoult, Medina Senghore and Jake Weber are all great. Taylor Sheridan's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and well paced. The music by Brian Tyler is really good.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
33,jadepietro,Putting Out the Fire,8,16 May 2021,"IN BRIEF: Standard but tense and well made action thriller.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) While I don't wish to send Angelina Jolie any negative vibes, I do want to tell her to choose a script worthy of her acting talents. This isn't it. It's a standard chase thriller with a child-in-danger story about a strong mother figure risking her all to protect her cub. Nothing original or engaging. No real stretch in the acting department either. It's Ms. Jolie as an action figure with movable parts, more in line with her roles from other tense thrillers like Salt or Wanted, both better vehicles.She plays Hannah Faber, a loner and no-nonsense firefighter who is suffering from PTSD. One day while out on patrol, she finds a scared young boy alone in the fire-consuming Montana wildness. Connor (Finn Little) is being hunted by some evil men and this instant family must now bond and elude paid assassins to save themselves. Will she? What do you think? You don't mess around with Jolie!What elevates this standard action thriller is the strong direction of Taylor Sheridan who creates a taut and gripping movie, despite a plot that is fairly predictable. Mr. Sheridan, along with with Charles Leavitt and writer Michael Koryta (whose novel from which this film is adapted), keep their screenplay moving at a nice clip and avoid most cliches and stereotypes rather successfully. Some illogical moments do pop up, but the capable cast keeps the level of suspense and excitement at full throttle.Ms. Jolie and Mr. Little have a nice chemistry together. One hopes their characters survive all of the numerous and frequent perils that they encounter. Nicholas Hoult and Aidan Gillen are the heavies and both talented actors lay on the menace very thickly and become convincing villains. Jon Bernthal plays Ethan Sawyer, sheriff and Hannah's former boyfriend of Hannah, a trite movie conceit if there ever was one, but the actor pulls off this thankless role. Medina Senghore plays Allison, Ethan's loving and pregnant wife. Jake Weber has a relatively short role as Connor's father who starts the whole domino effect and Tyler Perry acts against type.I suppose that Those Who Wish Me Dead is a diverting movie for its genre. I just wanted the film to be more inventive and less routine in its storytelling. Put me in the category as Those Who Wish for a Better Script. Still, as action thrillers go, this one is lively enough to entertain most moviegoers who are into the chase. (GRADE: B)",Those Who Wish Me Dead
34,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Those Who Wish Me Dead,7,15 May 2021,"""Give them something else to worry about"". Uh yeah, a blaze moving like a freight train will do it.Anyway, in 2021's Those Who Wish Me Dead, Angelina Jolie plays a smoke jumper who doesn't do a lot of smoke jumping. I mean Jolie as Hannah Faber is a little miscast here. She growls and gets through it but it feels like she landed the role because she's well, uber-famous.So yeah, Those Who Wish Me Dead is a street brawler action-er that combines wildfires and no man's land with hitmen shootouts. It's tense, it's unforgiving, and the professional killer characters are the real stars. They are calculated, they are business-like, and one of them keeps getting up like he has extra lives in a darn video game.Directed by the guy that made Wind River (Taylor Sheridan) and taking place in Montana (it was actually filmed in New Mexico), Those Who Wish Me Dead has probably the coolest title in the history of movies. I mean that and To Live and Die in L. A.""Dead"" for all its post-COVID liveliness, is about firefighter Hannah Faber (Jolie). Faber has to protect a teenage murder witness from two relentless assassins. The whole flick is set to the backdrop of the forestry wilderness along with a fire that was actually started by the assassins themselves (that's one big distraction). Innocent people get murdered, there's a little mano-a-mano, and you get to see Tyler Perry make a blinked cameo (he plays a subdued mob boss).Bottom line: Those Who Wish Me Dead is balls-out, intimidating, and sloppily action-packed. I'm gonna recommend it despite its smidgen of concluding implausibility (how could a humongous forest fire stop completely overnight?). If you weren't alive when 1993's Cliffhanger came out, then ""Dead"" might be a formidable alternative. Heck, see both movies if you ""wish"".",Those Who Wish Me Dead
35,mhorg2018,Angelina's rapport with the child is good in a plot hole filled film,5,16 May 2021,"First, the idea behind this is good - it's the actual film that isn't that great. I'll break it down into the good and the bad.The Good - Angelina Jolie, as usual, gives a believable, well acted performance. So does the kid she's protecting. Her rapport with the child is believable and well acted. The plot - unknown killers chasing down a forensic's accountant for some unknown reason has been done before, and better. The rest of the cast, especially Jon Berenthal, is excellent.The Bad. The plot has enough holes in it to drive a tank through. Who is paying to have the people killed? Why are they being killed? Why doesn't the forensics account have several copies of his information stashed as a protection? When Angelina and the kid hide in the water from the fire, he nor she thinks to check on the paper? Wouldn't the ink have run? Finally, woke and PC rear their ugly heads. I'm fairly certain that interracial couples in Montana aren't that common. I wouldn't blink at this if the story had taken place in say, New York or California, but this is just pandering to the liberal crowd. Also both main women are smart, tough and way more competent than most of the men, including the rather moronic killers. Can anyone write a movie today without dragging in such silliness? Just write good characters. So, overall, it was an OK movie, but it could have been much, much better.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Beyond that everything else was par for the course for an action flick. The acting was okay (except for Jake Weber who never really figured out a tone for his character).

38,arungeorge13,Taylor Sheridan tries to cover up the weak plot with stylistic strokes! [+53%],5,19 May 2021,"Taylor Sheridan is a writer-director who pens scripts keeping the geographical landscape of the premise in mind. In Hell or High Water, it was the vast stretches of barren desert. In Wind River, it was the icy backwoods. In Sicario, it was the dreaded Mexican border. Those Who Wish Me Dead tries to follow the same pattern but it doesn't work to the same extent. The setting here is the Montana wilderness (but actually shot in New Mexico), where forest fires are rampant. Based on the novel of the same name by Michael Koryta (who's also co-writing the screenplay with Sheridan and Charles Leavitt), the film boasts a pretty solid cast featuring the likes of Angelina Jolie (as Hannah, a depressed smokejumper), Finn Little (as Connor, a kid on the run after his forensic accountant dad gets murdered for whatever reason), Nicholas Hoult & Aidan Gillen (as intriguing assassins), Jon Bernthal (as Dy. Sheriff Ethan) and Medina Senghore (as Ethan's wife).Sheridan's most recent work - Without Remorse - had left me worried. After solid work in other films (even the Sicario sequel wasn't bad), Without Remorse felt like a total misfire. I watched Those Who Wish Me Dead with lowered expectations and it turned out to be one of those films with a balanced scale of hits and misses. For starters, the assassins are the most interesting characters in the film - something you wouldn't expect given the film's narrative. Gillen and Hoult are both having fun playing their respective characters and that shows! Jolie is an okay choice for the film's lead role - she's great in the emotional scenes but oddly enough, lacking in the action bits. Medina Senghore almost steals the show in a few unrealistic but solidly executed action scenes, however.The biggest attraction for me wasn't the clichéd shoot-em-up storyline but the crafting and visualization of the forest fires. The CGI shots left a lot to be desired - there's one particularly bad stretch where Hannah and Connor are cutting through a field that's constantly being struck by lightning. For a minute or two, I thought I was watching a Mortal Kombat film. The CGI looked weird. The same goes for the initial fire-fighting shots. The crew, in fact, created a forest (inside the New Mexico desert) that they set fire to in a controlled fashion. So, the actual shots of the forest bursting into flames are a treat for the eyes.The assassination storyline was terribly weak. We only know as much as Connor knows when it comes to why his dad is being chased. Even when the bigger stars take centre stage, we know nothing. It only acts as an excuse for Hannah and Connor to eventually meet. This lack of direction makes Those Who Wish Me Dead a largely joyless but frequently engaging affair.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
39,omendata,"Atrocious, foul mouthed, formulaic drivel of the worst kind!",4,20 May 2021,"If this is what Hollywood are reduced to making these days they may as well give up movie making.A lacklustre done to death storyline with absolutely nothing new to bring to the table, filled to the brim with the utterly unnecessary ""f"" word in almost every scene - Is this what we have dumbed our films down to these days?It is not teaching the young much except that using expletives is the done thing when movies of the past never needed it and it dismays me when I watch a film and it is just rammed with ""mf"" and the usual ""f"" word, what we would have called a lack of vocabulary in the ""good old days"" but also an indication of the talent of the writers of this ordure, if they have to keep using it to make things edgy when a good director can do without it completely. Check John Carpenters movies; you will rarely find the ""f"" word used or overt sex scenes or explicit violence and they were truly great films!I digress however onto the acting which was also basic and in some cases downright awful; Angelina Jolie in particular looks like she sleepwalked through this film and it may just be me but she looked rather strange, akin to Nicole Kidman who does not seem to be able to produce facial expressions either now, due to the amount of plastic surgery and botox she has had to undertake to keep her worthy of the Hollywood paycheque (very sad).Jolie's face was most disturbing and looked plastic which did not help with her stale and stunted performance in this; It was like watching a robot from Westworld. Most of the other characters were also wasted and miscast, Bernthal who is a good actor is also underutilised and did not stand out much either.The usual boringly happy ending and of course throw in a bit of wokeness and you have a turgid and depressingly low brow piece of entertainment for the knuckle draggers who will lap up anything with minimal story but ram packed with obscenities and gratuitous violence.How sad for the movie industry if this is the bottom of the barrel in entertainment and all we can expect in future!",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Clearly there were a few believability problems but hey ho!We had two Northern Europeans play the merciless heavies, who at one point threatened to brand a heavily pregnant woman with a poker, they had to die in due course, I am sure this counts as some sort of profiling for the woke readers of this review lol!The modest script was pedestrian and fantastical the action was inventive and suspenseful!

41,leftbanker-1,Dumstper Fire of a Movie - Stupid from Start to Whenever I Stopped Watching,1,21 May 2021,"Wow, this was just painfully bad. Just looking at the protagonist I wanted to reach through the screen and apply balm to her bloated and chapped Botox lips. A forensic accountant feels the need to tell his ten-year-old son his work against organized crime or whomever. They were like the team that plays the Harlem Globetrotters: completely inept at the job they are supposed to do, but, man, they are good at killing innocent people.Ugh. So dumb. Next, at the first trace of lightening, Angie dives off the tower and falls at least twenty feet flat on her back. Why did she jump? Why isn't she in a wheel chair for life? I guess the director just thought, ""Let's throw in some action."" That was just about the dumbest scene I've ever seen. Then they cut from her falling on her back, to her standing by a stream pulling porcupine quills out of her hand with a knife. Did that make sense to anyone? She backpacks in to the fire stand like it's a major accomplishment, then the little kid shows up after running about a half kilometer from the highway.Crack assassins can't seem to kill some schlub accountant? Then the cop just happens upon this crime scene that starter out in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Wow, what a coincidence. Don't you just love those for advancing a plot? This occurred literally minutes after the crime.How could she even make this horribly maudlin piece of dreck movie? It's embarrassing for me to even watch it alone at home, so how could she shoot this trash in front of a crew?On top of all of that horrible., she had a back history. Of course. I didn't focus on that part and turned it off, but I'm sure it was just as awful as the rest of the story. It was some trash about kids burning up while she just cried watching them. Great job!

Meaning story is similar, quality is similar, there is child being cared by the main famous actor. I think in the other movie mentioned there are more cool things like confrontations, words, and stunts. While in this one there is more typical things, Angelina looks too old, and this lacks some more stunts. I think this would be at least two stars better, was Angelina in some better role (boss, agent, military...) and was there more stunts (like those jumping from airplane). Instead desperation and negativity dominate. Disgusting to watch those wounds, injustice, and useless talk. Just adds up negativity to my daily life, something I don't need to see or hear. I expected they will show us something more, better, new. Instead, even there is no full end, but just skipped the political, news, investigation part. Another good thing is that this reminds us of real life personal issues like being left alone, in trouble, dealing with crime...meaning high level of associations and reminders arises.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

45,dtucker86,Angelina Jolie rocks,10,15 May 2021,"Someone mentioned the last time Jolie played an action heroine was in Salt way back in 2010. She proves she hasn't lost it in this very satisfying film. So many complain about the violence and profanity in movies, but I have another quibble. So many films these days feature characters that are about as likeable as poisonous snakes! I have watched a number of films recently where I said to myself that there is not single LIKEABLE character in it.Jolie and Finn Little (who plays the boy she protects) portray two LOVABLE characters that you really care about. She is a tough brassy ball buster but also haunted by the deaths of three children in a fire. She redeems herself in the end and this woman and boy have amazing chemistry together. You almost hurt for them. SPOILER ALERT This movie has one of the most brutal fight scenes between a man and a woman that I have ever seen. Jolie finally gets the upper hand and takes out the bad guy but gets beaten to a pulp in the process! Also SPOILER ALERT I was really angry and sad that sheriff died in the end and his pregnant wife lived. Why couldn't they both have made it?In conclusion, I also wanted to mention that film has some pretty harrowing special effects that might make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end (especially if you are afraid of fire). That scene where Jolie and the boy are running for their lives pursued by a hellish fire tornado made my blood run cold!

46,bankofmarquis,Disappointing,4,19 May 2021,"And...we have the ""leader in the clubhouse"" for the WORST FILM OF 2021.As faithful readers of my reviews know, I'm all for a ""turn you mind off"" action flick, not really caring about plot/characters, but let some competent storytelling and decent action scenes transport me away from the real world for a few hours (or in this case, for 100 minutes) and THOSE WHO WISH ME DEAD started off promisingly enough and so I settled into my chair looking to be entertained.I'm still waitingTHOSE WHO WISH ME DEAD stars Angelina Jolie as a ""Fire Jumper"" who is suffering from a traumatic experience and is shying away from human connection and interaction, looking for cheap, death-defying thrills to feel some sort of emotion. Into her world comes a young boy who has witnessed a murder and the murderers are chasing him, so she must save him.And...of course...there's a fire.I can roll with that flimsy plot (certainly other action flicks have been entertaining with much less plot) but TWWMD (as I will call this from now on) fails to capitalize at all on any of the aspects of the plot and fails to garner much in the way of interest throughout the film.Director/Writer Taylor Sheridan (the writer on the terrific HELL OR HIGH WATER) was brought on board this film early on as a ""script doctor"" and then stepped into the Director's role when the original director (smartly) dropped out and he promised the producer's that he could get Angelina Jolie to star in it.To be fair, Jolie brings the necessary star quality to the role of emotionally crippled ""Fire Jumper"" Hannah, and she looks like she was ""game"" for whatever Sheridan asked her to do - there just isn't much for her to do.And this is unfortunate, for Sheridan starts the movie with an interesting scene where our two hitmen (Aiden Gillen - ""Littlefinger"" from GAME OF THRONES and Nicholas Hoult - Beast in the X-MEN FIRST CLASS films) take out their first target. This is actually a pretty good scene and one that starts the film out with promise. Little did I know that it was the best scene in the film.After that, nothing interesting really happens and the other characters (with an exception that I will speak about in a moment) are not interesting at all (I'm looking at you, Tyler Perry, who was clearly doing a favor for Sheridan). As a matter of fact, some of the other characters were just plain annyoing (I'm looking at you, ""Fire Jumper"" Friends of Hannah).The exception to this is the work of Jon Bernthal (Shane in the first 2 season of THE WALKING DEAD) and Medina Senghore (an actress I had not seen before) as a local cop and his ""survivalist"" wife. These two bring some intensity and spark to pretty dull proceedings - I think I would have rather have seen a film that focused on these 2 characters, rather than Jolie's.Most of the blame for this must fall to Writer/Director Sheridan. I don't think he ever figured out what type of film he was making. Is it an action flick? Sort of (and the action scenes are not all that good/interesting). Is it a redemption story? Sure. (But I didn't buy how Jolie's character needed redemption). Is it a story of survival? Kind of (but I didn't really care for the child actor that was being saved).There was a good idea in here, but this movie wasn't even close to a good movie on this idea. Skip this one.Letter Grade: C4 stars (out of 10) and you can take this to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Those Who Wish Me Dead
47,juanmuscle,"I came here to see cause of all the mixed reviews I was ""curious""...",10,17 May 2021,"I think would be the word to use as the impetus , but yeah I came in thinking the worst cause of the bad reviews were very hateful and so of course I came in tainted but no man, it was fine, it did its job and everyone was great in it. I saw absolutely nothing wrong with the technical aspects or the writing or whatever, it set out what set out to do and told a story and we got some sort of closure and that's that. I would of loved to make clear a lil' more on what happens to all the characters in the aftermath, mainly the two people in the tower I felt like it was a bit unclear on that... and perhaps give it a lil' closure on those two characters the kid and Angelina is clear but it would be nice to just see them walk down the terrible burnt mountain , maybe a lil clean up or something... god that mountain suffered needlessly! But it was cool though! I wonder what happened to ol' gir's horse... he was nice she was riding the thing into the fire and then we don't see the thing anymore. But that's no big deal, the thing I find somewhat disturbing is the hate from the people when really the thing is just your basic meat and potatoes type of thriller! The idea of a thriller imo is that the idea is something so out of the ordinary so spectacular but still very close to life so you kind of have to keep all of those lil nuts and bolts super tight when re-telling the story because in a thriller there you are always retelling as it's happening , its sort of a longer news real that is unfolding in real time and so there is no room for extra-like-pulp-fun dialogue as for example an Indie that has free reign to do a lot more so , when people complain about something not being right in a thriller , that's what I don't understand because the writing is very very close to real life which is what a long newsreal is! Exactly that, so what you have to look for are really mechanical holes in the script but I didn't really see any... but I think it did its job and it entertained the best that it can do for what the thing is so , I don't know. I liked it , I especially loved the acting of that lil' kid he made me miss my dad and I can't stand my dad and his alive! Lol.... cool job buddy!",Those Who Wish Me Dead

51,kjproulx,A Solid Premise that Doesn't Take Any Risks,7,25 May 2021,"Regardless of the subject matter, I've become a sucker for any project that Taylor Sheridan (writer/director) is involved in. Wind River was the first film that he both wrote and directed and it ended up being one of my favourite films of 2017. For that, I was very excited to see Those Who Wish Me Dead. While it may not have all the nuance that his previous outing did, his touch is still very much alive here. It has issues, but here's why I believe this film deserves some attention.The film picks up with Hannah (Angelina Jolie), a hotshot survivalist who is struggling to cope with losses in her past. Alone in the wilderness and just trying to find peace, she stumbles across a young boy who has just witnessed a murder. Both now hiding from a looming threat and a forest fire on the horizon, it very quickly becomes a dramatic survival movie. There were almost too many subplots here for the short runtime that it has, but it all worked in the end. Some of the dialogue here felt generic at times too, so the fact that it had such a great cast definitely elevated the material.Angelina Jolie delivers a very solid performance here, but the standout to me was young Finn Little as Connor. His comradery with Jolie is what truly sold the movie for me. Their back and forth dialogue brought a smile to my face and their dramatic moments worked just as well. Sadly, the film feels bogged down the most with the characters Jack (Aidan Gillen) and Patrick (Nicholas Hoult). While they're both great actors, I found their storyline to be all over the place. There were scenes where it felt like they were being villainous for the sake of villainy and it didn't work for me. Their motivations were lacklustre at best.This leads me to the overall structure of the film. I enjoy when a film places you in the present with a character and has you learn about their past as the film progresses, but I felt like Those Who Wish Me Dead jumped into Hannah's past far too quickly. It was very obvious from the beginning what her arc would be throughout the film. It was well done, but the storytelling was too obvious at times. There wasn't enough left to be desired.Overall, Those Who Wish Me Dead has a lot of great elements in terms of performances, tenseness, and overall visual style, but the film sort of sputters out, to be honest. It pretty much becomes a film about good guys and bad guys in a very generic way and I felt that significantly hurt the film. Still, everything surrounding these poor elements more than made up for them. Now available to see in some theatres, streaming on HBO Max, and on-demand, I think Those Who Wish Me Dead could find a small audience who loves it. I would recommend checking it out.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
52,Movi3DO,Average although decent thrill,6,14 May 2021,"A brand new movie just added to HBO Max. A traumatized and retired firefighter who had to protect a boy from those who wish him dead.When I saw the trailer, I expected a pretty simple thriller. And I was right. The trailer showed most of the story. The plot was seen a bunch of times before, so there wasn't any surprises here.The acting was pretty decent across the board. There wasn't much complex emotion or scenes that required these actors to show their best.Even though the plot was simple, I still wanted a decent thriller, and the movie gave me that. There were some pretty okay and intense action scenes, and they were handled well.My biggest problem was the characters. At the beginning, the movie showed the event that traumatized the main character, played by Jolie. However, I did not see the significance of this event to the story at all. It didn't impact her character when she was in the action scenes.Besides the main character, there were minimal development to the other characters. Jon Bernthal was badass as usual, but I didn't care for his character much, or any other characters.Overall, a decent thriller, but everything else was average and not memorable.

On one hand, they put on display the formidable force of mother nature; on the other hand, we see a kid being chased down by hired assassins. Such a preposterous commingle didn't pan out well for the Creators nor it did for us, the Audience!I'm up for multifarious concepts that deal with distinct subject matters but these ventures do pose a higher risk pretty much all the time. The writing needs to be punctilious throughout; otherwise, things could go sideways at any given time.Much like what went on here!The film opens up on a high octane note, with quite a pressing demeanor! Suffice to say, I was taken aback! I thought to myself ""Well, this is exciting!"" However, right after the onset of the second act; my hopes got shattered! Guess What? The storyline took a turn for the worse and became clueless about the trails it intends to pursue thereafter!Omitting few moments of tension, this entire execution is heavily reliant on the social commentary at its disposal! Which by the way corresponds to the valor of real-life firefighters and how they handle extraordinary circumstances at the risk of their own lives! It also takes a sly dig at us, the humans; who have always been guilty for these catastrophes one way or the other!Now, this particular aspect works fine to a certain extent. Nonetheless same is not true down the other side! The Subplot revolving around this poor kid and his father's guarded 'Secret' never came to light nor did we figure out anything in relation to this classified information which eventually led to his untimely demise!Despite being a technically safe & sound endeavor with a handful of well-versed names in the cast list; it is devoid of proper characterization & fleshed out backstories! Angelina Jolie is a seasoned actor, there is no question about that But from where I sit; she hadn't got enough opportunities to show her legitimate qualities as a performer.All of It could have made perfect sense if this only been served as an outright drama rather than taking those tentative routes; resulting in an uninspiring feature that will be forgotten in the days to come anyway!",Those Who Wish Me Dead

What could've set this film apart is the parachuting into wildfires, but there is virtually none of that in the film.The cinematography is the big standout here as the scenes right near the forest fire look amazing.

64,trinaboice,"Intense, predictable, and entertaining",7,14 May 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
A teenage murder witness finds himself pursued by two assassins in the Montana wilderness with a survival expert/smoke-jumper tasked with protecting him - and a forest fire threatening to consume them all. This action-thriller is based on a New York Times best-selling novel by Michael Koryta and stars the talented and beautiful Angelina Jolie.THINGS I LIKED:
It's been 10 years since we've been able to see Angelina Jolie in anything! Her last role was in the spy thriller Salt , which I really enjoyed. In this film, she plays a damaged character who is tough, yet vulnerable. She can always be counted on to carry the drama, emotion, and action in any flick. She trained 4 days a week for her role as a fire jumper and does her own stunts in the movie.Young actor Finn Little did a fantastic job in both the emotional and action moments. He's got a bright career in acting in front of him if he wants it! I'm a new fan!I've always liked Jon Bernthal. He definitely brings his A-game to the film, as does Medina Senghore, who plays his pregnant wife. That definitely doesn't make her a damsel in distress though. She knows how to handle firearms and dig deep to survive in crazy, intense situations.You get to enjoy some scenery of the beautiful wilderness of Montana with cinematography by Ben Richardson.Fans of Tyler Perry will be thrilled to see that he makes a brief cameo performance, although it's kind of a pointless scene.The fire sequences are definitely believable and never seemed like bad CGI to me.Director Taylor Sheridan does a great job of building tension.Helpful survival tip for when you're lost in the wilderness: ""Creeks lead to rivers, and rivers lead to towns.""THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's hard to really believe Angelina Jolie is a tough firefighter because she's so tiny. One of the other characters even points out how skinny she is. ""I'm lean!"" she protests. She's been in the news recently for stories about her weight loss. I've always thought she was pretty but she was absolutely stunning in her role in the movie The Tourist. Unfortunately, there isn't much of an arc for her character, although there is a small portion of resolution from a previous trauma she keeps seeing in flashbacks. Early in the movie, she has a drunken parachuting stunt that we assume will provide an opportunity for redemption by the end of the movie, but it never does. Weird.There were some surprisingly bad edits.The villains are so heartless that they almost feel like over-the-top cartoons. Even still, actors Aidan Gillen and Nicholas Hoult give good performances.We immediately know which characters we're supposed to root for, but the thin character development doesn't give us as much information as we would like about everyone. Too much time is spent in Act 1 setting up the plot that doesn't give us enough details either.It's a little bit of a slow burn, but it definitely builds to an intense crescendo in Act 3. It almost feels like a fiery disaster movie from the 1990s.There aren't really any new stunts we haven't already seen before, so ultimately, the movie will be mostly forgettable.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Profanity, F-bombs, and crude language. The child actor shouts a string of F-bombs.Talk of sex
Violence
People are hurt in dangerous forest fires
Destruction of forest and property

73,sweidman-28016,Mindless Thriller,6,31 May 2021,"""Okay, listen to me. Take a deep breath, hold it and lay back. Watch what I do.""From Oscar nominated writer Taylor Sheridan comes Those Who Wish Me Dead. A teenage murder witness finds himself pursued by twin assassins in the Montana wilderness with a survival expert tasked with protecting him -- and a forest fire threatening to consume them all. Taylor Sheridan has been on a roll. With both Sicario movies, Hell or High Water, and Wind River, and I should mention the tv show Yellowstone which is supposedly great, my hopes were somewhat high. The trailer didn't interest me too much and there were other movies of more importance to me coming out. The HBOMax-Warner Bros deal saves again. What we got was just as expected. Sheridan's writing and directing might not be as ambitious as previous works, but the movie is entertaining enough to hold your attention. The story should be as good as the concept. There are so many exciting parts to follow. My main issue comes with the flow. As more characters are introduced, we go from character to character in their different locations and how they relate to the current events of the story. Each one has something interesting going on, but for the most part it almost felt like they were in different stories. There's three different parts and at one point it could be something so intense and the other will be more mellow for the time being. It just didn't flow well. Also, it takes a while till the conflict begins. I kept waiting for something bigger but for 30 minutes there wasn't much.The casting is pretty good. I haven't seen Angelina Jolie in a while. Not that this is a groundbreaking performance, but she fit the role well. Finn Little has a good youth performance. Nicolas Hoult is fun to see in a villainous role. Tyler Perry makes a cameo. It felt weird but alright. This sort of goes with the writing but there was a lack of character development. Jolie is the lead and we get flashbacks to provide some insight on who she is. It's a little and works, I guess, since it's all that's vital to the story. Still, I wanted to care more these characters and just know who they are rather than protagonist and antagonist. The writing is sometimes too simple when it could be more. Simplicity is nice, but not always the best, especially when we have so much going on. Sometimes the writing is actually good. When it comes to Jolie and Little's interactions, the timid nature from both can help engage us more into the characters. All in all, it's not going for something great but just what it is. Those Who Wish Me Dead had the potential to be so much more but falls short. It's a fine watch if you are looking for a mindless thriller.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

81,Mike_Devine,A far cry from Sheridan's past work,4,16 May 2021,"Taylor Sheridan has been on a hot streak with western-set thrillers, from writing the Oscar-nominated 'Hell or High Water' to writing and directing the criminally underrated 'Wind River.' In his latest effort, Sheridan teams up with one of Hollywood's most bankable actresses and a young, up-and-coming Australian actor against the backdrop of the beautiful Montana wilderness. Despite having these ingredients, 'Those Who Wish Me Dead' gives off some serious ""90s action B-movie"" vibes that put it in a lower tier than its peers.'Dead' has a lot of things going for it. Besides the aforementioned cast, which is supported by resident tough guy Jon Bernthal and Medina Senghore in what is undeniably her breakout role, the film has a captivating setting, a mysterious government cover-up subplot and the story of a woman who cannot escape guilt from her past. There's so much promise as things get going, yet unfortunately we don't get any further than if we took a parachute ride launched from the back of a pickup truck.Somewhere along the way, things start to come apart at the seams in 'Dead.' The plot gets cast aside in favor of ridiculous, unbelievable situations and complete stupidity among some of the supporting characters (Nicholas Hoult and Aidan Gillen, I'm looking at you). Yes, it's a fictional story, and yes, we're expected to suspend belief when taking a journey into film, but some of the sequences here are a bridge too far. Most of the characters do not have emotional connections established with the audience, which is too bad given the caliber of Angelina Jolie's acting (again, Senghore is perhaps the one exception). It's also a film that strangely suffers from being too short - the inverse of what most of these movies struggle with.If you watch 'Those Who Wish Me Dead' in the hopes of seeing the next 'High Water' or 'River,' don't get your hopes up. If you're looking for another escape from reality and check your expectations at the door, you'll get what you're looking for.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

83,daisukereds,It's fine,6,15 May 2021,"This movie is a bit chaotic on it's script. It's good! Better than I expected, but it certainly wasn't what I had in mind from the trailer. There are several forces at work, so it's a nice change of pace from such tried-structured-movies. I'd be surprised if anyone isn't caught by surprise at some point.In summary, it's not about fire fighting, but more of a hunt/thriller.And for the question in everyone's mind : Is Angelina good in it? She's fine.. nothing more, nothing less. I wouldn't buy her being a fire fighter with her figure, but a Tower Watch and survivalist with ample knowledge? Sure.The rest of the cast is good. Specially liked the character Allison (Medina).Anyway, I quite like when I'm taken to places I would never be, and given information on how things are done there.. specially in professions I'll never have (Fire Fighter, in this case). But, I wasn't given enough, which is sad.. I would have liked more tips and such.The dialogue is sparse and simple, but it's not bad at all. Very professional and smart.. by everyone! Even the kid, who does a convincing job at all times. Plot is convenient at times, but you can accept it. There was one noticeable moment with a jarring change in music, but aside from that, it was competently shot with beautiful locations, good editing and pacing.It's a 50-50 on anyone liking it.

(but not before showing her hair flying in the wind - she's fearless, exciting and full of adventure!)Redemption story headed your way.As luck would have it, a pair of assassins have showed up to town to kill a ""forensic accountant,"" the reasons for this aren't remotely important to the story. These two guys are single-minded terminator types...there to do a job gosh darn-it! After pumping two million around into the dude they discovered his son had escaped...and - might have seen their faces. Listen, even if he did, how is he going to ID them? It was from a distance and the kid had no clue what was going on.But, since this is a dumb movie with dumb people, so they make the improbable dumb decision to track him down...loose ends sorta thing.Their quest to find the annoying kid leads right where you think it will.Amusingly, the killers won't kill a pregnant woman, but they'll kill a child. Ridiculous, since they already established in two scenes earlier that they operate without remorse (blew up an occupied house, and quickly killed a hapless female motorist who stopped to see if they needed assistance), but when the plot required them to have a conscious and to get injured, they hesitate.Of course, the kid runs into Struggles with Issues Superwoman, of course there is a massive fire - I'd mention the run through a field with lightening strikes all around, but it's just too silly...
and of course there is a final showdown...and cut to sitting on an ambulance bumper and have a good cry and a nice cup of redemption.To say this is a good ""popcorn"" flick is being too kind. It's lazy, predictable and unsatisfying. Good cast though and Aiden Gillen, as one of the killers, is always fun to watch.Cheers.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Director: Taylor Sheridan
Starring: Angelina Jolie, Nicholas Hoult, Finn Little, Jon Bernthal, Aidan Gillen, Medina Senghore etc
Overall rating 76/100Those who wish me dead is about a teenage murder witness who finds himself pursued by twin assassins in the Montana wilderness with a survival expert tasked with protecting him, and a forest fire threatening to consume them all.I thought this movie was really good, it could have been better but it was still very good. The opening was very effective and established character background well. The whole cast had fantastic chemistry with each other, liked the connections between the villains and the father. The movie did a good job at linking the two stories and main characters together. The movie had a very tense tone, and excellent building of tension throughout. The action and cinematography were great. There was a good amount of character depth and emotional weight. The performances from the whole cast, especially Angelina Jolie and Finn Little were fantastic. The movie had a nice amount of humour. The chemistry between Finn and Angelina was fantastic and both characters has a great connection with each other. I also thought the final act was great with satisfying character arcs.However, my biggest issues was with the villains. There was very rushed explanations into the reasoning behind their actions making it difficult for them to connect, and I felt like there was a missed opportunity to add more conflict between the villains as one was teased to be better and kinder than the other. For me their was a lack of chemistry and connection to certain relationships, especially the father and son relationship at the beginning. And there was also some inconsistent pacing issues, and lapses in the logic.So overall, Those who wish me dead is excellently directed, with a fantastic cast with great chemistry. And has enough intensity, emotion and action to be a fun and tense watch. But misses the mark on too many things to truly stand out from the crowd.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
86,januszlvii,Below Average Disaster Film,4,12 June 2021,"I am not a fan of Those Who Want Me Dead. Why? It is not enough fire and suspense for a disaster Film. Watch the Ring Of Fire or Towering Inferno for a great fire movie. Even more recent movies like The Hurricane Heist do better in the suspense department. There are unanswered questions as well such as what happens to the kid? Does Hannah (:Angelina Jolie) take him in or does he end up in a home? What about the piece of paper? I will say The kid is the best one in the movie, the Montana scenery, Hannah and the fire scene are not bad either ( although too short and nothing like Ring of Fire when it comes to a fire in a remote setting).

This movie is monotonous and boring it drags on for a lifetime with characters that you do not feel anything, nor invested if they make it through this. All it does is just waste time until the fire closes in at the end. Angelina Jolie character has no depth or whatsoever can't spend majority of the first hour just feeling sorry and crying with no moment of clarity or talking about it her troubles. The sheriff is essentially pointless has no reason to be have a connection to her, he contributes nothing for the whole movie apart for a excuse for the boy to come to Montana. His pregnant wife does more than he does she ride up on a horses with a rifle. This didn't have to have Tyler perry tacked on as the ""bad guy"" of the movie it's out of nowhere, out of place and it just feels silly. This music is ridiculously over the top trying make it seem like the situation at hand is more intense than it actually is mundane. This movie seems as if it would have worked better if it didn't bother with the assassins and focus more on Angelina Pysch.

But even though Those Who Wish Me Dead is senseless every once in a while, there are some moving moments in this watchable tale. The tale isn't fully compelling, but it's definitely watchable.Whilst there's an impressive child performance by Finn Little, the rest of the cast is pretty general and isn't too exciting or unique in any particular way. However, there are some amazing shots filmed throughout the beautiful location of the film along with the outstanding effects. Plus Those Who Wish Me Dead isn't at all afraid to own several rough and brutal moments. By the end, this action-packed and thrilling survival tale is decent, but doesn't live all the way up to all the hype.There isn't too much to go on about with this sharp, solid and stirring film. Those Who Wish Me Dead isn't a ""the-best-moving"" adventure, but is definitely watchable.

99,darkreignn,"Ridiculous and nonsensical, but a lot of fun",7,18 May 2021,"Critically acclaimed writer of ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" and renowned director of ""Wind River,"" it was once thought that Taylor Sheridan had the Midas touch. And then, some things started to occur. ""Sicario 2"" happened, and while I truly loved that movie, both critics and audiences were underwhelmed. This year, ""Without Remorse"" was recently released, with a screenplay cowritten by Sheridan - there can be no denying that ""Without Remorse"" was an awful film. And now, with ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" being both written and directed by Taylor, the scrutiny is once again returning.Helmed by master storyteller Taylor Sheridan, ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" is his third directorial feature, following ""Wind River"" and ""Vile."" I have not seen ""Vile,"" but I consider ""Wind River"" to be nothing short of masterclass, so I had high hopes for this movie. And this movie is by no means in the same caliber as ""Wind River"" - in fact, it's not even in the same ballpark. I am unsure if Taylor wanted to challenge himself to make a different film in terms of style and tone, but ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" has none of the smart dialogue, dark drama, and gritty violence of Taylor's previous movie. That isn't to say this film is all bad, however.""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" is actually a pretty fun time, in a B-movie sort of way. If you put even an ounce of thought into what's occurring on screen while you're watching this film, everything starts to crumble. A lot of the time, character decisions don't make sense, and neither does what's happening onscreen; for example, at one point, you'll see a character engulfed in burning flames, and in the next scene they'll have a slight mark on their face, and absolutely no other evidence that only 30 seconds ago they were about to burn alive. There are plot holes you can pick at, inconsistencies that you can call out - but if you can look past that, I honestly think you'll have a good time - that is, if you make it past the first 35 minutes.The first 30 minutes or so of this film are 5/10 material, if not lower. This is a busy film, with so much thrown at you in the beginning that you'll start to feel like you have whiplash. Character after character, scenario after scenario, location after location - nothing feels fluid or earned or led to. Things just keep happening, characters just keep appearing, and you're expected to be engaged, when most likely you'll be left confused and bored. However, if you stick through it, once the action hits, things really do start picking up.This is a pretty exciting movie, with a great sense of spectacle to it. One things for certain: Taylor knows how to direct action. There are tense, claustrophobic escape sequences, thrilling shootouts, some good hand-to-hand combat, and, of course, all the natural disaster escapades that you could ever hope for. Everything is really fun to watch, and thanks to Taylor's competence, it all looks great. None of it makes any sense, but it is entertaining. However, I may be a bit biased here, because what really made me enjoy the movie more than I probably should have is the cast, namely one Jon Bernthal.Jon Bernthal is a phenomenal actor - he can literally pull off any emotion to pitch-perfect perfection. Anger, distress, romance, sympathy, rage, sadness - you name it, and he can do it. He has so much time to shine here in every category, and he glued me to the screen. Jon is completely riveting here, with so much screentime that he is basically the main character - in fact, even though Angelina Jolie is marketed as the main character, at points this did feel more like Jon's movie, and if you're a fan of his, that'll be sure to please you. But how is Jolie in her role? Ehh. I mean, she isn't bad, but she's nothing memorable here. She's serviceable, but brings nothing particularly interesting to the table. She wasn't necessarily bland, but her performance didn't strike me in any way. To be honest, once I realized Jon Bernthal was in this movie, I began watching it for him, and wasn't disappointed.This isn't a good movie - let's get that out of the way. But, it's not a bad film, either. I had an extremely fun time with ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" - it felt like an action movie that would've come out during the late 80s or early 90s, to be honest with you. It's silly and ridiculous, but that just adds to the fun. It may not have the dialogue that Sheridan is known for, or the true-to-life grit that he brings to his work, but I can say for sure that it has entertainment value in spades.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Jack (Aiden Gillen) and Patrick (Nicholas Hoult) were after Owen as Owen had evidence of large scale corruption in his work for the District Attorney, and they believe the evidence Owen had is now with the boy. Jack and Patrick figure Owen went into the Montana woods heading for his brother Ethan (John Bernthal) who is a Deputy Sheriff and his wife Allison (Medina Senghore). Now Connor is alone and afraid and meets up with Hannah (Angelina Jolie), who is a fire-fighting Smoke Jumper with PTSD and now works out of a Lookout Tower having been demoted for a failure to save some kids from a forest fire. We get the impression she was one of the boys. The contract killers now set the woods on fire.We never know who the evidence is against that Owen had. We do see Tyler Perry as Arthur, who gives instructions to Jack and Patrick to find the boy and end this asap.A sort of secondary story involves Deputy Sheriff Ethan and Allison who also run a Survivor School and they get caught up with Jack and Patrick, too.Notable: Boots Sutherland as the Sheriff, who cautions Deputy Ethan not to risk letting the media or the FBI know about what has happened so far.It was good to see Angelina Jolie back in the movies. Hope we see more of her. Owen's son Connor played by Finn Little did an outstanding job as a scared kid who lost his father and was warned not to trust anyone. Owen had written out the evidence he had and gave it to Connor to give to only someone he trusted. Hannah did read the pages Connor had but when they jumped into the river to escape the fire, the water probably did a job blurring the print. We never did see Hannah relate the evidence to authorities near the end. So much for doing in the bad guys. Hey, at least Hannah and Connor were safe. Well, you knew that would happen, right?There were some scenes that were completely unnecessary along with too many past memory flashbacks brought up by Hannah; and also too many scenes with other glitches (Hannah survives a lightning strike) in the story, but to relay them here would take too much time. Still it's watchable.Yes, Angelina Jolie is the star, but the story is really about the boy, Connor. Then the title fits. See? (5/10)Violence: Yes.Sex: No.Nudity: No.Humor: No

That's exactly what has happened here.I can't really recommend this movie, but I don't want to completely dis it either. If you've had a tough day and want to watch something that doesn't require much brainwork or emotional investment, where you know exactly what's going to happen before it happens, where you're not going to be shocked by anything new or original and if you can suspend credulity and sometimes your gag reflex for 90 odd minutes, then this is the ideal movie for you.The only question I kept asking was what are Aiden Gillen and Nicholas Hoult doing in this?

Set in rural, heavily forested Montana, the story follows a firefighter as she tries to protect a young boy from a deadly duo of assassins.However, ineffectual writing, a barrage of cliches and weak secondary characters make this a tiring watch. Taylor Sheridan, the much-lauded writer of the classic Sicario (2015) and who also wrote and directed as one of my personal favourites, Wind River (2017), has not put in his best work here.Angelina Jolie is made to carry the weight of a mediocre script and oft-repeated tropes and the limited character arcs of her supporting cast consisting of an uncharacteristically off-colour Nicholas Hoult and an under-utilised Jon Bernthal.Other than Jolie's earnest performance as a firefighter exercising the demons of past traumas, the other bright sparks are Aiden Gillan (the actor who played Baelish in GOT), who makes an instantly loathsome villain, as well as the talented child-actor Finn Little.Too many cliches.

107,PCC0921,If it Didn't Have Modern Day Effects An Episode of Chips Would Be Better,5,22 May 2021,"Released: May 14th, 2021
Viewed: May 21st, 2021When it comes to dealing with two different plot lines, those plot lines don't always come together. In the case of this film, one plot unfolds involving a young kid, who has valuable legal information that can put away a lot of bad people in the government. After an attack on him and his father and escaping from the bad guys, he runs into Angelina Jolie, who is a forest fire ranger and expert survivalist, in the middle of nowhere, thus plot number two unfolds.Hannah (Jolie), is on tower watch and Conner (Finn Little), our kid on the run, following instructions from his father, follows the creek and eventually runs into Jolie at the tower. As you would know it, the bad guys set a fire at a rest stop in order to draw the town's attention away from them and their job of killing the kid and any other witnesses. Thus brings in, at no surprise, the whole forest fire angle of this film.What comes after that is a dull, average, action film that works better on a network crime show. Which, is an interesting notion, because the film was also released on HBO Max at the same time it was released in theaters and the theater I was in was the size of a gift shop. It fits that. But, things are not terrible for this film. On it's base level it is just fine. It is polished just like anything else with 21st century film/digital technology. That is it though. It has just an average appeal and pace to it.The characters are basic and it's a shame too, because with a seasoned, popular supporting cast like, John Bernthal, Nicholas Hoult and Game of Thrones alumni, Aidan Gillen this could have been something. John Bernthal was the stand-out actor. Everything you liked about him from Walking Dead (2010 - Present), to the Punisher (2017), is here too. One of the surprise characters, that I wasn't expecting, was Medina Senghore as Allison, Bernthal's Sheriff Ethan's pregnant wife, who ends up being the character you most want to root for. She is a breakout character and fits nicely in with Bernthal's stand-out sheriff.I was questioning the believability factor when it came to some of the scenes in the fire and with a lightning storm, but they sell it enough, that it provides that modern age cheesiness found in films like this. If you take away the 21st century special effects however, then any twelve episodes of Chips (1977-1983), are better than this is. This may have been just an extra vehicle for Jolie to ride with to help jack up interest for her, before her MCU debut happens in the Eternals (2021), coming out later in the year.Its not a horrible film. Not by a long shot. The pace of the plot is boring and it takes awhile for things to get going. I am still going to give it an E for Effort, which means, I still recommend seeing it. It still provides the escapism that Hollywood provides and even though it has a slow build-up and pace it still has enough interesting things going on that makes it fine for an hour and a half.

Aiden Gillen (Jack) does a good job playing this type of character, reminded me of his effort in 12 Rounds in 2009 (tt1160368). This isn't a fast paced action/thriller.

115,arabnikita,Enjoyable as long as you don't try to dig for every mistake,6,19 May 2021,"Those Who Wish Me Dead (2021)In a strange way, this movie reminds me of Gone Girl. Not in terms of the narrative but in terms of the overall feeling that I got while watching the film. Right from the start, it put a silky veil over my eyes with the beautiful production design and engaging plot. Everything worked as long as I didn't touch that veil and I was pleased with the majority of the experience. Similarly to Gone Girl, if you allow to keep that veil to stay on your eyes, you will likely enjoy the experience. However, if you decide to take it off and start looking for cracks, you will end up disappointed with the movie.Those Who Wish Me Dead is a very simple action thriller about a firefighter who tries to protect a little boy who carries a big secret. We don't know what the secret is and it doesn't really matter because the plot moves along at rapid pace leaving us no time to wonder. There are a number of positives about the film like the casual dialogue where characters actually speak like normal people. What's more, for once, we got a clever kid who actually follows instructions and understands that the assassins chasing him are not here to mess around.I liked how from the very start the film makes you hate Aidan and Nicholas and they play their parts with deadly accuracy. It was good to see Angelina in a serious role even though she is too skinny to play a firefighter. When you put all these positives together, they do form a formidable thriller that is easy to enjoy as long as you don't intentionally try to make it bad for yourself. The cast did a fine job and the story was engaging enough to allow me to look past most of the mishaps. It's not great, but it's certainly not as bad as some make it sound.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

122,hoernkeem,"Those Who Wish Me Dead (2021, Taylor Sheridan) A disappointing outing for Sheridan who has shown tremendous promise",3,12 July 2021,"Lately I have found Taylor Sheridan to be disappointing me. He had an amazing run writing 'Sicario' and writing 'Hell or High Water' and writing and directing 'Wind River'. I thought we had this amazing new voice able to tell good, Oscar level neo-western style stories. Most recently though Sheridan has written 'Without Remorse' which is an underwhelming Clancy vehicle for Michael B. Jordan, and he co-wrote and directed this film which is sort of genre mashup featuring Jolie miscast as a haunted Montana smokejumper. This film doesn't have much in the way of visual flair and the plot is as basic as it is messy. I had no idea what this was about when I walked into it. I didn't even know Sheridan directed it so I actually got excited when I saw his name come up. Color me confused when I realized the plot is this weird amalgam of a witness escaping from professional assassins, and rough, rugged Montana smokejumpers. What? How do these two things occur in the same universe?We meet Jolie who is an alpha female smokejumping badass. She drinks hard and plays hard and shirks the rules on odd ways as we see some bizarre, dangerous ritual where she stands on the back of speeding pickup and opens her parachute for reasons. Recently, however, a forest fire she was in charge of went bad and people died and now she is haunted by those ghosts and she is exiled to a fire lookout tower with little to do but think and wallow in self pity. Meanwhile a forensic accountant is on the run from assassins out to kill him. So he takes his son and runs. It just so happens that accountant guy had a friend out west at survival school so that's where they are going and through super assassin skills (insert sarcasm here) the bad guys discern that fairly quickly. It becomes assassins versus firefighters trying to protect an innocent witness from being silenced as a loose end. They never even follow that ultimate plot thread. We have no idea who is really doing this or why. We are really just honed in on the very insular nature of good guys vs. Bad guys here in wild west. Those larger questions and issues apparently belong in another movie. Naturally Angelina Jolie unintentionally lands squarely in the middle of chaos along with her ex played by Jon Bernthal. Of course they throw in a wildfire for good measure because how could we have a movie about smokejumping firefighters and then have no fire? The film reaches a wishy washy predictable climax where nothing is really resolved other than the good guys win... I guess.Sheridan has the capability to do some great work. 'Wind River' was my favorite film of 2017 and 'Hell or High Water' was top ten the year before that. 'Those Who Wish Me Dead' is just a mess with none of the conviction or believably tense stakes that those other, superior films, possess. Despite movie level talent this felt more like a movie of the week from network television. It was underwhelming and at many turns nonsensical. It was so disjointed that it almost didn't feel like a completed movie. I will continue to watch Sheridan's career with interest and hope that he reverts back to the quality writer/director I know he can be, but this endeavor was well below what he and this cast is capable of.Eric's Grade: D.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

No idea how Angelina thought this is a good script for her career.....yet maybe she wanted a trip to Montana.The other pathetic part is Montana has 0.5% black population and of course Hollywood has become so PC it places two great black actors in super white Montana. Huh? What is next..... Arctic Nanook of the north is a Black transgender. ;)
Hollywood is becoming pathetic in the crap they pump out these days, and sad to see Bron studios is involved in this piece of junk.. as they make great films in Canada.

154,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,Action thriller that is an entertaining one-time watch,7,12 June 2021,"Those Who Wish Me Dead is a by-the-numbers action thriller that buckles under the weight of a labored script working double-time balancing subplots for its star-studded ensemble cast. It is an entertaining one-time watch, especially to see Angelina Jolie starring in an action movie again, but it falls short of requiring repeat viewings.Hannah Faber is a smokejumper dealing with the trauma of accidentally causing the death of three children during a forest fire rescue attempt. Guilt-ridden and carrying a death wish, she mans a fire lookout tower in the Montana wilderness.Connor, the teenage son of a forensic assistant, is a witness to a murder and on the run in the Montana wilderness from two professional assassins trying to silence him. He crosses paths with Hannah Faber, who then must use her survival skills to keep them alive.The film's exciting fire sequences viscerally show the unpredictable nature of what they deal with. I was fascinated by how the film peers into the lives of smokejumpers and forest rangers. Forest fires spread a lot faster than I imagined. After all, what kind of person does it take to want to parachute into a forest fire? The ensemble cast create a real sense of community that answers that question through different individual characters.Aidan Gillen, who has been blessed by God in the emanating-evil department, and Nicholas Hoult, who has the rare opportunity to play against his sensitive and cute image and break your heart, make for intimidating villains as the two assassins. Jon Bernthal also helps ground the story as a police officer who gets caught between his job and protecting his pregnant wife.This overarching scale comes at a price though. As the film has to juggle all the subplots populated by other established actors, Angelina Jolie is oddly sidelined in her own movie.It's too bad. The Hannah Faber character has the makings of a new action heroine. She's vulnerable yet capable, chock full of gallows humor and is played by Angelina Jolie. Jolie looked like she was having fun delivering these sardonic and bitter lines all dripping with bile. The character reminded me of John McClane in Die Hard With a Vengeance.Her character, Hannah Faber, is guilt-ridden from a botched rescue attempt but it is drawn out too simplistically. Is this her first failed rescue attempt? Has the character dealt with failed rescues before? Is it particularly hard cause it was three kids? None of it is truly explored and it is reduced to being function for the plot.Fin Little, the child actor who plays Connor, steals the show with a raw fine-tuned performance that convincingly sold the trauma. His performance had me thinking realistically how much trauma the average teenager can stomach within a day.Those Who Wish Me Dead is standard entertainment. It's not bad. There's just nothing that stands out that warrants another adventure with the Angelina Jolie character in a sequel.

This movie is fine as background noise while you scroll through Instagram or Pinterest lazily on a late Saturday night but if you are looking for something to get into, this is not it.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
156,waltermwilliams,We Didn't Start The Fire,6,18 May 2021,"Five word film titles rarely work because as human beings we are not capable of that much memory retention.In that case ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" was not off to a good start, however it's a decent action, thriller with an all star cast.Aussie Finn Little play young murder witness, Connor, who knows where the bodies are buried (so to speak)
He finds himself pursued by twin deadly assassins.Marvellous Irish actor Aiden Gillen, who played ""Little Finger"" in ""Game Of Thrones"", is one of the most diabolical, cold blooded murderers currently on the big screen as Jack.His murderous mate Patrick is played by English former child star Nicholas Hoult ...who's just as twisted.Together they hunt down Connor in the Montana wilderness with survival expert and local Sheriff Ethan (""Punisher"" Jon Bernthal) helping to tracking under threat of duress while his pregnant wife and fellow survivalist Medina Senghore has revenge plans of her own.Meanwhile the headline act, Angelina Jolie, as Fire Ranger Hannah, is protecting Connor from the men in black and a wild forest fire threatening to burn everything in its path.We didn't start the fire, but I know who did.If they make a sequel chances are Jolies' character would adopt this child as her own.Director Taylor Sheridan was only meant to help with a re-write but ended up directing after another filmmaker dropped out.He promised the studio Angelina Jolie and delivered in spades to get the deal across the line.Sheridan would have made a great used car salesman.When you enter the cinema it's best to suspend belief in all things like physics, science and math and you'll survive this fire too!It's an adrenaline packed rush in theatres now.Watch out for: ""Medium"" star Jake Weber as Connors dad. Plus in a small but pivotal role is one of the worlds richest actors, Tyler Perry, as Arthur.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
157,TheMysteriousReviewer,The Dangerous and Average Wildfire Survival,6,5 June 2021,"Those Who Wish Me Dead is okay, but it could've been a little longer. Like the story is mediocrely weak. There aren't much character development. And the ending of the movie has left with what would happen after that scene. But at the same time, the movie can get interesting with the fighting scenes. The cinematography is nicely shot, especially when it comes to the wildfires. The actors give a solid performance. And the connection of Hannah and Connor does come to the right place. Personally, I'm not a book media guy myself. But I can say that this is the movie based on a book. If this is the idea and you think it's interesting enough, this could be for you. If not, then you're not missing out much. It's a okay book adaptation, but it could've have better writers on this.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

But I've seen that the readers of the book haven't appreciated the movie either. So, I'm not giving +1 and my final rate is 6/10.. Before speaking about the movie itself, I feel the need of mentioning the talent of the young actor, Finn Little. I'd seen him in Storm Boy before and he was really shining in that one too. I think he has a great future in his life. I wish him the best.. I don't think Angelina Jolie had that big part in the movie or she just couln't make me feel it. Still a decent acting tho.. The effects were not the best. The villains were not that memorable but this movie still is a good watch. I did not regret it.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

The special effect, story, plot, and others are all just slightly above average movies, which I would say normal. There are little flaws that are unacceptable but still watchable. The problem it did not shoot up to 4 stars because it did not have that excitement boost for viewers.

It seems that people are just getting more difficult to please. Idk if that is due to everything going on or if it's because people are just too spoiled with unending entertainment these days.The movie was good. The acting, music, everything. No, it didn't go into detail about what the information the boy was carrying was, that wasn't really relevant to the point of the movie. Am I curious? Of course. Did not knowing ruin the movie for me in any way? No. Solid performances all the way around, anyone that says otherwise is just being petty. I'm personally getting tired of all the spoiled people complaining about everything constantly, some people just seem to expect everything to be Oscar worthy. Its ridiculous.Anyway, this movie was definitely worth watching once and I wasn't bored through it. It kept a good, steady pace. It was definitely worth a watch and I personally enjoyed it just fine. The casting and visual effects were excellent. The score and mood were consistent. I enjoyed it and would watch it again.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

I truly expected better, especially from Taylor Sheradian directing, but he didn't write it, so I shouldn't have got my hopes up.The acting was subpar and terrible from such good actors like Bertnal and Jolie and even Holst was bad.If you have HBO Max and need a mildly entertaining movie for the night, watch it, but man was it disappointing.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
163,garethwooduk,Angelina Jolie plays second fiddle,6,3 June 2021,"Angelina Jolie back on the big screen, but even know she has a back story and leads the narrative she very much plays second lead to the 2 hitmen who hold the story, plot was easy to follow, decent enough suspense but at times it lagged a little but overall not a bad watch!",Those Who Wish Me Dead
164,MovieWarfare,"Jon Berthal's wife in this movie,Medina Senghore, is the real star!",6,15 May 2021,"Those Who Wish Me Dead is directed by Taylor Sheridan who is known for writing Sicario and Hell or High Water. He also directed Wind River which is an amazing movie. So hearing that he is directed and writing a new movie with Angelina Jolie as the main lead sounds like a recipe for success. The premise is ""Still reeling from the loss of three lives, Hannah (Angelina Jolie) is a smokejumper who's perched in a watchtower high above the Montana wilderness. She soon encounters Connor (Finn Little), a skittish boy who's bloodied, traumatized and on the run in the remote forest. As Hannah tries to bring him to safety, she's unaware of the real dangers to follow: two relentless killers hunting Connor, and a fiery blaze consuming everything in its path"". So was one hell of a fire or a smouldering mess?Firstly, all the actors do a great job in their respective roles. Angelina Jolie gives a great performance as a person with PTSD. She delivers some dry charisma to a person who seems fed up with everything perfectly but is also able to deliver those emotional moments effectively as well. Finn Little who plays the kid is not a terrible kid actor, thank god. He felt really believable as a scared kid and was also able to give an emotional performance as well. The antagonist played by Aidan Gillen and Nicholas Hoult are also great. Aidan is still able to give that creepy yet charming performance while Nicholas was quite surprisingly scary near the end of the movie. The supporting cast also all do a fine job with Jon Bernthal still being charismatic and lovable in his role. The real stand out has got to be Medina Senghore who plays Jon's wife in the movie. She is the real badass and the real star of this movie.The biggest praise has got to be the cinematography by Ben Richardson. There are some gorgeous shots here that feel like it's out of a painting which is partially thanks to where it is shot. Ben does a great job with the lighting especially when the fire starts to come into play. He illustrates fire in a way that makes it look quite beautiful despite the situation of the characters. One thing that is brought back from Sicario is the wonderful gun shoot out scenes. They are gritty, grounded and great to watch still as it feels real. While it isn't an action movie, there is a great shoot out scene between two characters that are incredibly tense.Nevertheless, the plot and characters aren't that good. The antagonist who is trying to kill the kid is shown at the beginning to be ruthless. Afterwards, they seem to forget that they were ruthless and continue to do dumb decisions that involve sparing people or forgetting about certain people. One of the antagonists even says that ""they will kill anyone who sees their face"" but then they don't, which makes the line seem stupid. They also start a fire as a diversionary tactic but it didn't feel like there was much benefit to doing it. There is also a really dumb part in the story where Hannah (Angelina Jolie) and Connor (Finn Little) leave the watchtower to trek to town and even run past a field getting strike by lightning. However, they decide to go back to the watchtower because of a raging fire even though there are killers after them!My biggest gripe has got to be the plot device that the entire story is revolved around, what Connor's dad discovered. The antagonist work for some evil group and that group wants them to kill Connor's dad because he discovered something about them. The thing is, we never do find out what that is. It just feels like a giant insult that we don't even find out what it was considering the whole story is revolved around it. Likewise, the ending doesn't even completely resolve everything and feels a little empty. We don't know what is going to happen to our characters from now on or what the evil group is going to do since they are still functioning.Overall, the biggest reason why I liked Taylor Sheridan is not here. The writing is very weak and probably the weakest he has done. Still, if you can get past the weak writing then there is a somewhat enjoyable action thriller movie with impressive visuals. Just watch it for Medina Senghore, trust me she is the best part of this movie.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
165,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Those Who Wish Me Meh,6,15 May 2021,"What was the last movie that anyone saw Angelina Jolie in? Maleficent from 2014? No one cared about the sequel to that, right? Well, she's back this weekend in the action, thriller, Those Who Wish Me Dead. This movie is following the Warner Bros. Strategy of a simultaneous release in theaters and on HBO Max. Let's see if you should care about Jolie in this movie.Those Who Wish Me Dead is directed by Taylor Sheridan, who wrote one of my favorite movies from 2016, Hell or High Water. There are multiple plot threads in this movie that predictably converge as these types of films do. Angelina Jolie plays Hannah, a smoke jumper in Montana who is dealing with a devastating loss in a previous fire. Finn Little plays Connor, a teenage boy on the run from the men who have been after him and his father. There are the assassins (Nicholas Hoult and Aidan Gillen) chasing after Connor and his father for some not clearly defined reason; and there is also John Bernthal, who is Connor's uncle, and his pregnant wife that get caught in the literal and figurative cross fire. The action moves them towards the vast Montana wilderness as a fire encroaches and Bernthal, his wife, and Jolie attempt to protect Connor.Those Who Wish Me Dead is nowhere near as taut or clever or fascinating or entertaining as Hell or High Water. Since the plot is really simple, even if the motivations of the characters are convoluted, the only hook there can be is whether you care about what happens to Connor. On a positive note, Finn Little is a good child actor. He makes Connor compelling and not annoying as many teens in these movies can be. Plus, Little has good chemistry with Jolie. The bond between Hannah and Connor is fast but believable. Ultimately, you want them to survive. I will shout out Medina Senghore, who plays Allison, Bernthal's pregnant wife. She's good and gets to have fun kicking butt while pregnant - the only other interesting cast member.Everything else plot-wise is just meh - it could be any movie, happening anywhere with any cast of characters. Just add a fire and you got it! It's like Twister except for tornadoes there is a forest fire and assassins after Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton.Speaking of fire - I really feel duped. I thought there would be more of the actual fire in this movie. All of the promotion really sold the fire aspect and it's so minimal. What we do get is fine, but ultimately disappointing. I don't even know that watching it on a big screen would make it any more impressive. Also, Hannah is a smoke jumper, but we don't get to see her do that! That feels like a missed opportunity and waste of Jolie's action chops.Those Who Wish Me Dead is an alright movie. There's no real hook here that make anyone need to run out and see it immediately. It's definitely not necessary to see in a movie theater. At best, it's a Saturday afternoon in the background kind of movie. Take a handful of popcorn and look up every now and then when you and the buds are playing cards.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Why couldnt we see it get revealed?Trite, barely there backstory (""Oh she was traumatized and now she is morose and broody character looking for salvation!"")Implausible. I mean, we are talking about a movie where Angelina Jolie is a Smoke jumper; someone who parachutes into forest fires.The way they escape the fire is BEYOND laughable.If there is one positive aspect in this movie it is the 2 hit men.

The direction of the movie and the screenplay and on top of that the presentation, all three of these worked in such a harmony that literally makes you glued to your seat and builds up the thrill for you as the time progresses. The story is also fine but a little bit more improvements could have been done. What makes this movie stands out more is that this movie doesn't have many predecessors.

The fire and special effects are excellent as you'd expect but some of the casting didn't work for me. Jolie was not believable in the role and the assassin's sent to dispose of the boy weren't particularly formidable. The boy was good though conveying emotions.What bugs me about this is that we're introduced to what appears to be the top villain, somebody who actually is formidable in one scene but it all amounts to nothing because it never comes back into play.I just thought as with most Taylor Sheridan projects there'd be more to it.

Helping the kid is a chance for her to cure the trauma. Besides the main story, there are a lot more things happening. The actors of the bad guys are doing great. The good guys are also doing great.

The story is the worst part, but also the action scenes and the acting are bad. They are in the woods and the locals are survivalist, yet they never use the woods to their advantage. I was hoping for Home Alone in the woods. It feels like a movie made during the pandemic.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

It was lacking and a very slow (as in boring) start before much action really happens and when it finally did it wasn't that impressive.

200,graves-scott,Far from the original book.,2,13 May 2021,Take a look at the book. The original has two extra good guys. They run the survival skills camp the boy is put into for witness protection.For this movie the couple are removed and the smoke jumper becomes the bad ass. Nothing but a pointless vehicle for a washed up actress. Which is a shame. The book was real good.,Those Who Wish Me Dead
201,lisacarlson,Don't Waste Your Time,1,7 August 2021,Poorly written and acted. It's hard to believe this has Taylor Sheridan's name on it. His movies are usually much higher quality. I love Jolie but she's terrible in this role. Incredibly violent along with some unrealistic scenes. If I were Finn Little's parents he would not have been in this movie.,Those Who Wish Me Dead

You can't review a Mickey Mouse cartoon like it's supposed to be Schindler's List! Just like you cant review McDonalds like it was a 5-star restaurant.One of the complaints I read a lot in all these reviews is that you need 'suspend of disbelief'. Well duh, of course you do! This is a POPCORN ACTION FLICK. Howmany popcorn action flicks did you see in your life where you DIDN'T need a couple gallons suspend of disbelief??I enjoyed this movie just fine, and for a standard action movie it wasn't even that many times overdone, it had some originality.

206,jonsid57,Average thriller,5,15 May 2021,This film started very slowly and early on was quite unwatchable. The film did pick up after the assassins killed someone . The film had a few good action scenes and thrilling moments . Jolie is average in her role . Finn Little does a good job as the little boy who sees his father murdered at the hands of the two assassins . The men who play the two assassins are chilling in their roles .

I saw a lot of complaints that we never found out what the father knew - the specifics didn't matter, they never did. Personally I never even wondered. I'm pretty sick of what Hollywood is churning out these days but this one was OK.The actor playing the boy did an awesome job, he had me tearing up in one scene.A lot of the characters went about things in smart ways, which I enjoyed.My major disappointment was no romance.

217,creator301,Absolutely terrible,1,18 May 2021,"This one was sold as a big budget, big name movie. It was worse than a Netflix original. Not one moment was fun to watch. At one point the main character puts on a parachute and everyone gets super excited as she climbs into the back of an oversized truck. We expect her to jump off a cliff or something epic. She pulls the chute while theyre going about 30 on a back road and she lazily drifts to the ground after a garbage cgi version of her spins slowly off the road. That was a good metaphor for the whole movie. Even the fake explosions sucked. Why did they do this to Aidan Gillan too? He is a legend and they even made him look like a joke. Stop giving your money to hollywood. Its dead.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
218,iamianiman,Those Who Wish to See this Movie...,5,7 May 2021,"There are times when a movie comes out of nowhere, only a few weeks before its theatrical release, the trailer is released and the poster is revealed and we then only know that it's acted by some famous celebrities and this time around, it's Angelina Jolie. Those Who Wish Me Dead is one of those movies where it feels so sudden, and the next thing you know, it's right there in the list of 'Now Showing'.Here's a list of FAQ that some of you cinephiles are looking for.Question #1: Does Angelina Jolie have ample screen time?Suggested by the poster is a hint that Jolie will be given plentiful screen time which means that audience will think she is the lead character for the film. But the truth is, she's not. The main character here is the boy, portrayed by Finn Little who gets lost in the woods after an unfortunate incident happens. This means that the story revolves around him, Jolie is better said to occupy the supporting role. She has a lot of screen time right after she finds the lost boy. So no worries, she is still the spotlight!Question #2: How is this compared to Taylor Sheridan's previous film, Wind River?Wind River sets in snow while Those Who Wish Me Dead sets in the wilderness ablaze territory. In addition, Sheridan also writes the screenplay for Hell or High Water, sets in the dessert. We see that Sheridan has a pattern of using different geographical landscapes to build his film's premise. Wind River uses its landmark explicably well, with rising tension and rich storytelling that absorb the audience with its setting. This film tries to do that with a similar concept of cat-and-mouse game however, this film falls flat. There's something missing here. It's like the story is figuring out where to go along the way while it's being unfolded. It's unsure with the direction it's heading unlike Wind River. Coming in with a mediocre expectation, I found this to be... okay. Wind River wins by miles.Question #3: This film is rated-R, how violence it is?Yessss, I'm glad that this is rated-R. This is one of the things I like about this film. Because of its adult content, it doesn't hold its punches when it comes to showing gory stuff. There are even some highlight moments that can get your adrenaline moving fast.Question #4: Never seen Finn Little before, is he any good?From my viewing, he's got a pretty good acting skill. He has been in Angel of Mine and 2067 but those aren't blockbusters so probably a lot are wondering, 'Who the hell is this boy?'. He's good, but not good enough cause I wish they can somehow replace him with Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place, Wonder, Honey Boy). I feel that he can play the part much better cause he's more suitable with the role, honestly.Question #5: How about the CGI? Is it realistic enough?Some frames are but others aren't. There are times where you'd gob-smack seeing how realistic the fire is similar if you've seen Only the Brave. But there are shots that are edited badly, you know it's CGI the second you see them.Question #6: Seeing that this is a survival genre, does the story keep you engaged?The story isn't as heavy as Wind River or Hell or High Water. It's meant to be made commercial where the story doesn't come out as heavy for the general audience. The story is simple with a little bit of flair and it keeps the audience engaged by hooking them with riddles as the core question to why all of this is happening is hidden. However... however by the end, the audience is left with many questions as well as only a few that has been answered. Like mentioned earlier in Question #2, it has no clear direction to where the story is heading.Question #7: What is your overall thought for Those Who Wish Me Dead?I pretty much felt like there's a lot more to be desired. The pacing is slow enough with merely basis storytelling going on it makes me fidget during the first half. Only the second half when things get exciting. This is one of those movies where you watch for the sake of its action or actors but it's not mindless either. When you leave the theatre, you'll at least get some knowledge on how to survive a lightning strike or forest fire. Overall, this is an okay movie.Question #8: Who should watch Those Who Wish Me Dead?Those who:-Want to see Angelina Jolie kicks ass.Love assassination films.Are devoted fans of Taylor Sheridan's previous portfolio.Want to grasp how-to-survive tips.Don't mind major plot holes.Verdict: Those Who Wish Me Dead delves deep into the burning forest with sharp survival skills however, it forgets to leave behind a compelling script resulting in a thin narrative that can only go as far as a horse running from a ruthless predator.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
219,bdpeterson-06310,Bad...,2,23 May 2021,"There is honestly too many things wrong with this movie to list them here. But just know that this movie was BAD. Angelina Jolie was one of the worst casting choices I have seen in a movie in recent years. In a movie about rugged firefighters and outdoorsman facing off against trained assassin's, Angelina Jolie, with her plastic surgery and terrible Botox stuck out like a sore thumb. It was ridiculous, and on that fact alone the movie was completely ruined. Honestly it was absurd, I sat in the movie theater stunned and amazed that the filmmakers had even considered, let alone had her in this movie. Also Angelina Jolie's character was nowhere near explored enough, she has PTSD but we hardly got any insight into exactly why. Something about seeing kids burned up in a fire and her not ""reading the wind right?"" Just wow, it was BAD. On top of that weak writing and a incomplete storyline prevented the viewer from fully understanding what was even going on. We had no idea really why the assassins were trying to hunt down the father and son, or where they had come from. Some thing about the father being an analyst of some kind? They absolutely had to flush that out and it was incredibly bad writing that they did not. Oh and Tyler perry was in it. Terrible movie.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Although the action and chase is entertaining, the important information was never disclosed to the audience.This film did a decent job in displaying the story, with flash backs serving as a valuable piece to understanding why the protagonist (Hannah/ Angelina Jolie) was motivated to help the boy.Decent film, I would suggest you watch it if you have HBO max.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
223,dannyrovira-38154,COMPELLING THRILLER WITH FINE TURN BY JOLIE,8,25 May 2021,"Taylor Sheridan's compelling thriller which is tense, visceral and gripping. About a guilt-ridden traumatized Montana forest firefighter named Hanna, sensationally played by Angelina Jolie in an emotionally powerful performance, who helps a teenage boy named Connor, superbly played by Finn Little, who is the son of a murdered forensic accountant, Owen, wonderfully played by Jake Weber, that before his death gave Connor written evidence that the two merciless professional assassins, Jack and Patrick, chilling played by Aidan Gillen and Nicholas Hoult, who killed him must have for their employer. Hanna must use all of her expert survival skills to allude the two pursuing killers, but now she has another major problem which is a massive forest fire heading her way. Solid direction by Sheridan who gives his film exciting action sequences, gorgeous cinematography by Ben Richardson, and a terrific score by Brian Tyler. Outstanding supporting performances by Jon Bernthal, Mediba Senghore, Terry Perry, Boots Southerland, and Tony Kittles. I really don't understand the hate for this film which some people have for it, as a piece of cinematic escapism it is an engaging, entertaining, and highly suspenseful motion picture and certainly worth a watch. Highly recommended.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

When it all ended I thought what the heck happened and what was the story?? No conclusion just lots of action and good visuals and scenery with no real story.,Those Who Wish Me Dead
226,dalefl,Who What Why,5,17 May 2021,"Man, this film left some major questions unanswered. It's ok and I've seen worse, but I walked away not knowing why anything that happened in it... well... happened in it. There were some pretty good scenes and the acting was very good with Jolie, Bernthal, Little, and Baelish, I mean Quinn shining best. There was also some pretty bad CGI which was exposed by some of the worst editing I've seen in awhile. That had to be the most intense, fastest moving fire in the history of cinema. And none of it came together because they never explained why it was happening. You just know that the mob wanted these people dead. Why did they blow up the guy's entire family and how was he involved with all this to begin with? What did the boy's father have to do with it? How did the hit men know he was going to be coming down the road they were staking out? Did they camp out there hoping he'd go driving by some time? The only answer I can come up with is that they found out where he lived and knew he'd have to come down it sooner or later. But if that's it then why didn't they just go to his house and kill him? That's what they did with everybody else. And last but not least we've got the ridiculous scene in which two people who must have lungs the size of Jupiter hold their breath underwater while a raging forest fire blazes over and all around them until it burns out. I get the feeling that, like a lot of other movies, it ended up running too long and some scenes that may have explained things ended up on the cutting room floor. At any rate, it does not work at all in it's released form.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

246,JoelAlexanderr,Sunk below my lowest expectations,2,20 May 2021,"My expectations were low for THOSE WHO WISH ME DEAD, but it somehow managed to sink below even that. While the movie is never offensively terrible, I can't think of one scene in this entire movie that made me feel anything other than incredulous that this turned to be such a train wreck.Every single actor in this film, all of whom are amazing performers in their own right, are given absolutely nothing to do. Nicholas Hoult, a fantastic actor who gives award-worthy performances in projects like Mad Max: Fury Road and The Great, is reduced to a boring assassin who goes multiple scenes without saying one line of dialogue that isn't just exposition. Angelina Jolie needed a far better return to cinema than this, for her character is annoying and boring for much of the movie, with the only interesting scenes of acting being the ones where she is thinks of a traumatic event from her past. Even more incredible actors like Jon Bernthal and Aiden Gillen are extremely one-note throughout, and while Bernthal attempts to make the most of a horrible script, it is never enough to make anything interesting.The fact that the same guy behind tour de forces like Hell or High Water and Wind River (Taylor Sheridan) made this forgettable and cringeworthy film is astonishing to me. Something must have gone wrong during filming or post-production that made them slap this movie together at the last second and release a terribly edited and produced oddity. Hopefully all of these actors and filmmakers redeem themselves with their next projects. D+",Those Who Wish Me Dead

250,daniel-kyle,Biggest tactical mistake,3,27 September 2021,"Aside from numerous **other** plot holes, the single mistake that makes the entire movie senseless and unnecessary is that the two hitmen don't go directly to the Survival School in Montana to wait for the father & son to arrive. They know he is headed there (or, at least for this story, have determined this as most likely) since they are staked out along a nearby road that must be the only route to the School. That causes problems to soon mount which just keep getting worse for the killers.Go to the School. Kill everyone (3 or 4 people, depending on whether the Deputy is home) when the father & son arrive. Movie over.Angelina Jolie not even involved.And just because I don't want to go and add to Goofs, I will also note that in a rural region like Montana, the FBI doesn't have a ""dispatch"" frequency, and certainly not one that is shared with local law enforcement, so the killers could not have plausibly ever had radio communication with the Deputy Sheriff and their lying about it could be one of the things that tipped off the Deputy's wife that they were fake.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

254,jaredkjacoby,A Firefighter's Journey,7,17 May 2021,"A smokejumper or a wildland firefighter remembers her past when three young boys were killed in a forest fighter she could not prevent. Her new post is at a fire lookout tower in Montana which is a big forest. Meanwhile, a forensic accountant learns that his boss and his family were all killed by an explosion. Thinking that they will be targeted next, he takes his son and goes on the run. He gets the sheriff and his wife involved, but the accountant gets ambushed and murdered. His son survives and meets up with the smokejumper to escape the assassins attacking him.Those Who Wish Me Dead is an action thriller film that has a more unique protagonist than most action movies do. Instead of a cop, the main character is a firefighter! I always thought that firefighters deserve more recognition, so it is nice to see a movie like this showcasing one as the hero. While this movie is nothing truly extraordinary, it is a solid thriller that packs some great cinematography and brutal set pieces. The story is standard with several familiar clichés in action movies. There is the adult and child characters bonding, there is the traumatic flashbacks of the previous forest fire for Hanna and there are the two scumbag villains who will stop at nothing to kill who they need to. However, one character that surprised me was the sheriff's wife played by Medina Senghore. She seems like she would be a victim or damsel that would need help, but she is arguably the strongest character in the movie. She is pregnant, but she is able to fend off the two villains by herself when they confront her in the most badass way possible. I cheered when this scene happened. She was a smaller character, but she left the biggest impact on me because it shows that you should never stop fighting for your life, even if you are confronted by two gunmen.As for the rest of the characters, they are okay, but they are elevated by the performances of the cast. Hannah is a pretty traumatized firefighter, but it is clear that she wants to make up for her past by protecting Connor when she meets him. Angelina Jolie gives the right amount of emotion to make her character work. She is kind of stoic, but she is emotional at times and she means well. The child, Connor, is terrified of everything happening around him and he should be. I just could not help but feel bad for him. Not only was his father killed, but he is the target of the villains. What could he even do in this situation? The child gives a strong performance, especially with Jolie's character. His fear when Hannah is trying to calm him down is realistic. I probably would react that way if a stranger approached me after my father was murdered. The sheriff was the weakest character here in both strength and characterization. He gets one great scene against the villains, but that is it. I feel that Jon Berthnal kind of got wasted on this role.Then we have our villains played by Nicholas Hoult and Aiden Gillen. These two characters make the most despicable person from Wrath of Man look like a nice guy in comparison. These two are sociopaths to the core. There is one scene where they remorselessly shoot a random woman who just happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I love it when movies like this give us loathsome villains like these because it makes me root for their downfalls that much more. Sure they have little depth, but they really do not need any backstory. Hoult and Gillen deliver solid performances as these two sociopaths. They do not even show a whole lot of anger. They just seem cold.Technically, the film looks great. The setting is almost entirely in the forest. The movie takes full advantage of its surroundings. The forest looks natural and on location. The scenes with the forest on fire look stellar. It feels cinematic and realistic. The cinematography is gorgeous and it translates well to the intense set pieces. The action is beautifully shot and edited with the fiery forest used in perfect effect. The soundtrack is pretty good too, especially towards the end. The tension was building up and the music reflected that. The only knock I have against the film technically is that some shots look kind of fake. Some of the wide shots of the tower on fire look a little questionable. Otherwise, it looks fantastic.The script is where the problems come to play. The motivations for the mob boss wanting the kid dead are unclear. Does he or his father have something they want or are they just unlucky victims? Hannah's other firefighter friends could have had a little more development and her past could have been explored a little bit more. It clearly was traumatizing, but what were the circumstances of the fire and what could she have done differently? The plot points in general come in a sloppy way. They connect, but it feels disjointed which makes the pacing a bit off, especially the first act. It finishes strong though and the performances and relationships are just good enough to overcome these problems for the most part.Those Who Wish Me Dead is not without its faults, but it is a solid action-thriller. It is pretty typical in a lot of areas, but it has a lot of unique elements with its setting, its focus on a firefighter protagonist and a surprisingly badass supporting character. By the second act, I was hooked. I even cheered at one point which I did not expect. This is a perfectly fine film to watch during the summer.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

That doesn't mean the movie is bad. It just has a lot more potential. But what's still left is a fun enough action thriller.The good parts of this movie is obviously Angelina Jolie she is very good, and her chemistry with Finn Little is really funny. There's some decent action scenes, and an interesting story. I like the idea of assassin causing a forest fire to kill a child. It's a very cool idea. The action that's in the movie is mostly fine to somewhat good. It's nothing amazing, but it's well directed and fast paced. And finally there are some very sweet scenes between characters which really helped me root for characters. Mainly Angelina Jolie and Finn LittleNow this movie is fun, but it does have quite a bit of issues m. First the pacing in this movie is not very good. The movie takes too long for the plot to get going, and the whole wildfire aspect really doesn't play a huge role for the two leads. You only get fire action in the final 10 minutes. The tone is also all over the place. It wants to be a cheesy 90s movie, but also is taking itself way too seriously.Overall ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" is elevated by good performances, chemistry, and some decent action.

But honestly, maybe she is the least of the movie's many problems. The plot is all over the place, things happen randomly, characters act irrationally (i.e.: hardened assassins would kill a kid in cold blood but not a pregnant woman).

It seems to me the stupid exposition hand waving that is nearly unwatchable was the consequence of the final act being so costly to film so I can make my peace with that.The grand set pieces getting swallowed up by the flames and the no holes barred sensationalist action sequences really swept me off my feet. Angelina Jolie and the kid actor's chemistry saws believable, The Punisher guy and his wife not so much at first but by the end had me feeling every emotion.Nicholas Hoult needs to stop acting immediately. The concept of fighting off assassins Die Hard during Montana fire season with a kid in tow is a cool idea but horribly executed for the first half of the movie really. However, a dick character getting their last words spat back at them before getting deer rifled to the heart by a character who rode on horseback in a poncho to get there is peak cinema.Overall a fun throwback 90s style natural disaster action movie that deserves better. Good score obviously top notch cinematography, the fire really felt like a character and credit to the sound design and editing of it's climatic finish.

I was constantly at the edge of my seat and really couldn't work out where the story would go, it is very unpredictable. There are also some very stand out performances from the cast. The director does a fantastic job with this film. The film is intense I love how our director dove into the situations our lead characters find themselves in.The Bad- I thought the script was lacking I feel like they're were two different stories the writers wanted to tell; one about assassins and one about firefighters and the two plot lines sort of conflicted with each other. It did work for the most part but I feel like it ended up not having enough depth for the characters. If the film was a bit longer I feel like they're would have been more depth for the characters. I also didn't really quite get why the assassins are after the kid in this film, they briefly mention it but it never gets touched on again.Conclusion- Most of these issues you probably won't think about until after the film as you are so invested and on the edge of your seats throughout the entire film.

The acting wasn't bad, but the script, the story, the ideas and what happens is it's failing. Some cinematography was a bit too much panning now and again.The story while understandable to follow has no backstory, which makes the characters as hollow as the story itself. The more backstory for any character the more an actor gets to use, so for Angelina she had the most to work with. Hence, most the emotional depth of the movie was dealing with her character.What transpires is a series of both fortuitous and unfortunate events that do not make sense and everything happens with meaning and intent. The meaning of the journey is cheapened by this kind of story telling. Besides that there are plenty of questions that never have answers, and a couple points that are not believable at all.

280,brent-27849,"Ok acting, really bad plot",5,26 September 2021,"Just because the two hit men say there should have been two teams doesn't make it any less stupid, it just makes me wonder why is this movie so stupid that there aren't two teams? Given that, why do they blow up the house, drawing national attention? Why not do it real quiet like so maybe they can get to their next target before he realizes what's going on?Then they figure out where he's going based on a photo and set up a perfect trap. Guess if he decided to go in the opposite direction or maybe changed vehicles, they would still be sitting there. Not to mention, if the kid could go to the press with the incriminating info, why exactly couldn't the father? Not to mention if the bad guys are smart enough to think there are copies made, yet the father only has one for his son, not like ones all over the place? Not to mention if this is such a huge case involving senators and congressmen, how exactly is there not a team of forensic accountants with direct involvement by the FBI and Justice Department? Already too many, not to mentions....But back to the hit. So they don't check the car to make sure the father is dead or if there is any evidence they need to take. They don't check to see what happened to the kid. Instead they have to go meet their boss who asks them why didn't they check the car or find out what happened to the kid? By this time the kid could be sipping a soda in Hawaii with the entire press surrounding him.Then the sheriff shows up, sees a woman's head blown off, sees the car in the ravine and there's not what, like fifty local, state and federal agencies all swarming the area within an hour?So the two hit guys go back to the scene, two obviously seriously trained guys, yet they can't track a kid in sneakers, instead they have to kidnap the sheriff to help them?Still don't know why they set a fire in the first place. So there would quite possibly be hundreds of fire fighters swarming the area? Huh?In succession, one hit man gets his face lit on fire and Angelina gets struck by lightening, yet both bounce back up, like hey, who's roasting the marshmallows, smells good but I'm really not hungry.They corner Angelina and the kid at the smoke tower, yet they send the sheriff up instead while one of them climbs a tree to get a better view.One of the dumbest gun fights I've ever scene between the sheriff's wife and the burned hit man. It reminds of Naked Gun where Frank Drebbin and a bad guy are shooting at each other from two feet behind two garbage cans - expect that was supposed to be funny.Ok, so with all that, why even give it a half decent rating? Well, because I thought the kid was pretty good, the relationship with the father was pretty good, and something I don't always say about Angelina Jolie movies, Angelina Jolie was pretty good.Of course it starts out with the usual, oh, look, I'm Angelina Jolie, of course I'm tougher and badder than every guy in the world, and I thought, oh great, here we go again. But thankfully it gets better than just that.If this movie had been made twenty years ago, I could have seen Bruce Willis or Stallone starring in it easily. Yet strangely because it's Angelina, it's for the better.Two scenes come to mind. The first is when she first comes across the boy; he doesn't want her help. Now ten years ago, I'm sure I would have gotten from Angelina a standard smart ass reply, oh, well you're a stupid boy and you better do exactly what I say because I'm Angelina Jolie and you're a stupid boy. Instead she just threw up her hands, gave him some information and backed off and let him decide for himself if he wanted her help. Major improvement.The second scene is when the boy asks if he can trust her up in the tower. Again, ten years ago I would have expected from Angelina to give her usual best impersonation of a Bruce Wills or Stallone character, usually with a whiny sneer that says hey look, kid, I'm Angelina Jolie, I'm tougher than any guy in the world, you better trust me. Instead it was an honest response in which she wasn't just saying you need to trust me, she was in part actually asking him to trust her.So yes, in some ways she still plays the usual, I'm Angelina Jolie, tougher than every guy in the world, character, but at least in the big fight scene, she doesn't just kick the butt of some guy who would obviously be way stronger and way more trained than her. Yes, the guy is stupid beyond belief to turn his back on her, but at least it was within the realm of reasonable.So, movie bad, Angelina pretty good.

282,NBates1,Very enjoyable,10,17 May 2021,"While Sheridan's previous works, Hell or High Water and Wind River, provide more satisfying emotional journeys, Those Who Wish Me Dead is a fast-paced, pulsating thriller with a truly fantastic cast led by the mesmerizing Ms. Jolie. The cinematography is beautiful and provides for some truly fantastic shots, and the sound design is on point. Brian Tyler's score also deserves a shout-out.The chemistry between Hannah and Connor was great and made for some genuinely sweet and funny moments, but it was newcomer Medina Senghore who stole the show.The third act is where everything sizzles, literally, to a satisfying conclusion. I only wish it were a bit longer.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Every movie set to be released in 2020 has this fault. It's nobody's doing. The world got screwed. Unfortunately that means the pacing of movies is being crammed.

I don't require a movie to have a multi-level plot and deep character flaws to be entertained. Most everything was fine here. The actors did well with the script they were given. I didn't see anything wrong with the CGI as others have commented. The action was fine, and pretty much everything made sense.There were only two things I would change. One character's story was not entirely completed at the end. A 10 second scene would have fixed that part of the ending.The other item was the language. I get tired of the constant use of the f word.

The worst inconsistency is when one of the killers, burned in the 6th degree continues to live as if he had just broken a fingernail, it's just intolerable. And this other passage where the father on the run with his son, is overtaken on the road by the two killers when he had a comfortable lead over them and the killers did not know what their destination was, because one of the photographs framed on a wall was only a guess between a thousand.

We're expected to believe that this man has such damning secrets that the ""agencies"" are willing to blow up residential dwellings in virtually broad daylight. We're expected to believe that this hotshot firefightress is so bad ass, but that she is remediating herself after a traumatic field experience. THIN, at best. We're expected to believe that these agents of the cover up are so well trained, cover their bases, then finally the junior one makes a rookie mistake? THIN. Then, finally, we're expected to believe that this raging blaze is nothing more than a plot device, LITERALLY! Just all around THIN.

There are a lot of better examples of that trope: ""Witness"", ""3:10 to Yuma"", ""16 Blocks"", even ""Crocodile Dundee 2"".One of the big issues with this movie is that Angelina Jolie is completely miscast as a fire jumper AND her character (as she plays her) just isn't very interesting. A 'theme' of the movie is that she is suffering from PTSD and that she is fighting her own demons while fighting the assassins. However, I never really could buy her in that roll. It would have been a better movie if is had focused on the local sheriff and his wife, who were two much more interesting characters. The movie also has a lot of loose ends and unbelievably lucky events that give it an overall slipshod feeling.I am giving it 5 stars on the strength of some good acting and dialog by some of the secondary players. The assassins in particular were well done (menacing... while still human).I don't think this movie would appeal to either Jolie fans nor fans of the action/adventure genre.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

318,cmtaylor-10993,Not as bad as some reviews state,7,14 June 2021,"Can't quite understand all the low review scores. Whilst this movie isn't the best I've seen it's certainly not worthy of a 1 star review, particularity as I've yet to see a good justification for such a poor review.After a long drought of not having new movies to watch, Those Who Wish Me Dead is quite refreshing. In a good way it sort of has a old school 90's / early 2000s feel to it, only with more violence and the general story concept was fairly interesting.The story literally grabs your attention within the first couple of minutes when our two 'villains' wipe out a family to prevent high level government corruption from getting out. This leads a chain reaction where a single father, learning that he is next on the hit list, attempts escapes with his young son to his in-laws in the forests of Montana. He rest of the movie is about the two hitmen playing a game of cat and mouse with the surviving witnesses.The two villains are the two stand out characters and possibly get more screen time the lead. Angelina Jolie is decent as usually and plays a fire watcher that gets caught up in the conspiracy.The movie is just about the right length only running for just over 1 hour and 30 minutes, the pacing moves the story along very nicely.Aside from the terrible title, the worst aspect of this film is that we never truly know why the men want the father and son dead. It felt like a bit of a cope out really, leaving it to the audiences imagination.Worth watching, and judging for yourself.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

I went to watch the film because its director was Taylor Sheridan the guy who made ""Without Remorse"", ""Wind River"" ""Hell or High Water"" and the ""Sicario"" films. But this isn't Sheridan at his best. Aside from the two Maleficent movies, Angelina Jolie hasn't done much, so it's a little surprising to see her in a below-the-radar production like this.

I trusted that the direction, cinematography and editing would make it compelling. I was not wrong. My problem with it is Angelina Jolie; I don't mind her, but she was the wrong person for this role. They could've at least made her put on weight and beef up, take away the makeup and put her hair up in a bun or ponytail. There were so many other actresses who would've been better and it was hard not to be distracted by this thought for the first half of the movie.

It also follows a predictable formula of the two characters miraculously surviving incredibly dangerous situations. There are also moments deserving of an extra eye roll. The pregnant lady riding on horseback to save the day is one . Angelina still looking beautiful despite being beat up, and barely escaping a monstrous forest fire is another.Don't expect the film to delve too deeply into reason or emotion.

331,Abfabbb,TV quality movie (Lifetime or Hallmark),6,17 October 2021,"I would have been disappointed if I had gotten dressed up, driven to a movie theater, paid $13.00 and saw this. It was okay to watch at home during a pandemic for an already paid for HBO subscription. Half the premise was semi-interesting. Angelina Jolie was a real miscast. Firstly, she is way too thin, looks anorexic---unfortunately and most likely due to her previous major surgeries, the death of her mother and then a high profile divorce. She has never regained her weight and has looked unattractive for years. She basically hides under long skirts and trench coats in real life. To put her in a movie as firstly, a kind of sexy rebel, working in a male dominated field (didn't work) and then in constant action scenes while she is thin as a toothpick/frail (didn't work) and lastly, adding an underwear scene is only compounding the problem. The second problem was her HAIR. The long wig was completely unbelievable, unattractive and distracting. I guess the director wanted the biggest name star he could get to help the movie but....someone 46 years old/frail----cannot play a Lara Croft type or a Mr. And Mrs. Smith type. She used to be that person (that's what the movie needed in her role) but she is not that person anymore and it really took away from the movie.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Her best acted movie since The Tourist (Salt was so poorly directed and terribly edited that I can't even take it seriously) the rest of cast was great too.

The all-star cast deliver great performances but the dialogue was cliche half the time. While the chemistry between the main protagonist and the kid feels genuine it takes awhile for the movie to get there. The start felt like two different films: one regarding the kid, the other about Jolie's character. Once the two merge the plot develops interesting enough and the movie finally finds its footing. There was a surprising amount of action in the movie that is entertaining enough but you have to suspend your disbelief in a lot of the decisions these characters make as well as the ending.

The reason why I considered watching it is because it stars Angelina Jolie. Come to think of it, maybe it's just another movie that wants to show that a female character still can perform well and not get stressed out in a male dominant profession in the story.

Because Jolie has reached a certain age, he thought she was incapable of performing as she typically would in her action movies. The most they let her do was swing an axe after taking a beating.There are SO MANY male actors who are on the receiving end if de-aging technology that allows them to continue having long careers in the action genre. Will Smith, Gerard Butler, Liam Neeson...
Does Angelina not deserve that same respect? She has been one of the top female actresses in the genre for decades despite her hiatus. It was extremely disappointing for Sheridan to attempt to cut her action career short.Angelina has a long career ahead of her. She deserves the same respect as anyone else in the genre with longstanding careers.As for the movie itself, the beginning and the end was unnecessary. I won't give any spoilers, but the beginning of the movie and the terrible ending was obviously a complete afterthought. Angelina deserved better.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Angelina Jolie is the stand out of the film delivering a powerful and believable performance and her chemistry with Finn Little who played the boy was outstanding. I haven't seen Finn Little in anything before but he was fantastic and I loved him every second he was on screen.

356,buckybit,Average Thriller - rather disappointing at that.,5,17 September 2021,"Taylor Sheridan wrote Sicario, Hell and High Water, Wind River. His ability to dive deep into the culture and the background of his characters made me expect from him yet another excursion into the American myth of reluctant heroes and heroines.But, this movie is something else completely. It is a rather straight forward action thriller, which is chasing it's plot while being chased by it.There is no room for more poetic or philosophical elements. There is no time - nor the desire - to show more than a few moments of what made me fall in love with his previous movies.On top, of being a well executed but rather unimpressive action thriller, the cast of a-list characters - in my opinion - stands in the way.You have so many familiar faces on screen that they distract even from that little character building that is allowed between the action. With no-name actors, the viewers would at least have had the anxiety of not knowing where this movie goes.Do not get me wrong. This is perfectly fine entertainment, but I expected more. Maybe, too much.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

I thought Finn Little did a fantastic job as the young boy, and should be considered the breakout role. The ""bad guys"" were really well done too, and the movie sticks with what could happen in real life for the most part. (There were a few things about ""the fire"" that were maybe a stretch.) Could be an 8 maybe, but I went with 7 .. 7.5 would likely be the real score I'd give the film if it were available.

Well, except why they needed a fire.This movie has an interracial couple but, for once, it doesn't come off as ""Forced woke"" crap that is the Hollywood norm. It is very natural and works really well.I don't like child actors they just don't have the skill or experience yet but, this actor was very good.Good ending, this movie is worth a watch, very entertaining and a solid 6.

362,dnlhml,A worthwhile watch overall.,7,10 August 2021,"This falls in line with what seems to be a current trend, and that is, feminist-themed action movies. Not militant, political feminism, but rather just the depiction of women doing all the ass-kicking and heroic stuff, while men take a backseat (a few recent examples are ""Rogue,"" w/ Megan Fox, ""Monster Hunter,"" w/ Milla Jovovich and ""Shadow in the Cloud,"" w/ Chloe Grace Moretz). Nothing wrong with that, mind you, if it is done well, and this one is pretty effective. Like most action/suspense movies of this ilk, the story has its share of improbabilities--but so what, that's not what you're here for. You want good acting, characters you can identify with, a plot that isn't too ridiculously illogical, plenty of action & suspense, and impressive special effects, and this movie delivers. Some reviewers complained about the fact that we're never told enough about what the kid's dad was involved in as a ""forensic accountant,"" but does it really matter? It's sufficient to know that he was ruffling some feathers in his work with the DA, and he's got some bad, if inept dudes after him. The emphasis here is mainly on the chase and the interaction between the boy and Hannah (Jolie's character). Of course, other significant individuals figure in, and it's all set against the backdrop of a fierce forest fire. It'll hold your attention just fine.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

The script itself is deeply contrived and very poorly written with the bad guys of the piece finding their prey in ways so unrealistic no intelligent person could believe it.The bad acting, loose pacing and numerous plot holes paired with shallow characterization results in a thriller with zero thrills.

We don't get anything nearly as exotic for any other character. They're all pretty much one-dimensional people that we've met in other movies.The basis for the plot and every other piece of narrative is divulged during weird, broken dialog that hints at something without ever telling us what. It's really odd. I even checked for an end title scene because the movie literally feels like it's missing a couple of important scenes.The action is fine and good. It's the one saving grace. That and the unresolved promise of some kind of explanation for everything is what got me to the end.

The best thing of this film was the acting Angelina and all the cast including the little kid (who looks a lot like Shiloh with curly hair) were amazing they really made the film alive.Many of the fans thought that this was going to be a full action package for Angelina like Tomb Raider, Wanted and Salt. But they were wrong this film is more a thriller than an action film and Angelina have some cool action scenes, but she's not powerful because she's just a firefighter ( I found her at The Axe fighting scene a resemble of the New Tomb Raider reboot, I don't know if that was intentional or they put it just like in the book, and to be honest I saw more Lara in that scene than Alicia in TR 2018).Now to the problems:
First, the idea of the film was very simple a dad gives his son an information written down and must delivers it to the press, but the film ends without giving the audience any idea of the information !Sec, the kid just trusted Angelina like that agave her notes!!! Although his dad told him that he should be very careful!Third, and the unforgivable problem was the sheriff wife (She was pregnant with a baby with six months and they through her on the table and nothing happen, and to make the matter worse she went after that to rescue her husband riding a horse AND THE BABAY NEVER CAME DOWN!!!",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Long story short - NOPE!To it's credit, the movie has some well constructed action scenes and tasteful wilderness vistas, but a distinct lack of actually likeable characters coupled with poor casting (ie: Nic Holte as a bad guy lol), a paper thin script and wholly unsatisfactory final act dampen down what could've been a real Hollywood barn burner.There are some serious plot holes and credibility issues throughout (such as the ludricous lightning strike scene in a field and a six months pregnant action woman (cringe), which illicit many moans and groans in between your popcorn munching.In summation, while a super skinny Jolie puts in a half decent shift, she can't save this mediocre flick from failing to ignite.

They do seem to go from smooth operators to action movie cliches about halfway through the movie as well.The film made a big deal in its trailers and other marketing about the fire in the forest but this was woefully underused. There is a brief flashback scene and near the end of the film the fire turns up just for a few minutes of tension and poor CGI.The brief but sudden violence that you might have come to expect with a Taylor Sheridan movie like Sicario or Wind River isnt here at all, it's a bland, by the numbers film when it comes to the action and wont wow you with anything you havent seen before.Angelina Jolie was a terrible casting choice, the film could have been salvaged with an older more rugged actress who looks and sounds the part of a tough Smoke Jumper, but Angelina Jolie with her long haired wig doesnt suit it at all.Steer clear of this film unless you have nothing better to watch.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

422,truthbrarian,A underrated secret-Horror movie for a Popcorn Night,7,23 May 2021,"This movie has flaws, Angelina Jolie is a disastrous casting choice but I admit Those Who Wish Me Dead gripped me and I felt fear as the different violent acts unfolded on the screen. Where I think the movie is underrated are the villains played by Aiden Gillen and Nicolas Hoult. They are set up right away as very intelligent, methodical killers, who can set up traps and kill without remorse. This made me feel fear through the movie since they were capable of doing anything. Villains like these are rare and it raised the stakes of the movie.One of the most impactful Black characters in recent history who was such a badass was Medina Senghore. It was almost like watching Sigourney's Ripley from Alien again with how cool it was, Medina uses her screen time to maximum impact and I want to see more from her in anything, perhaps a Black Panther movie. Best of luck to her career.Angelina Jolie for what it is worth, I thought her acting was good even with her physical limitations. I think the special effects are neither bad or good, they are okay, with the fire effects at the end paying off for me. The cinematography of Wyoming looks incredible though and is beautiful to watch.Where I think the movie misfired was how it handled Jon Bernthal who was given basically nothing to do and it was really disappointing as a Bernthal fan to see nothing from him. We know the director Jim Sheridan can make complex interesting male characters so this was a bad effort.I think what the movie does bring you is a sense of horror and excitement and I think for a lot of people, they'll also feel that way and if you watch it with friends in a darkened room with snacks, it'll give enough thrills to give you bang for your HBO Max buck.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

This isn't a Marvel film where we throw all disbelief out the window. I know she may ""want"" to be an action star but as Clint once said, "" a man has got to know his limitations."" Glamorous looks are a curse if she truly wants to play someone approaching real, and she doesn't help it with her beyond lean physique (sorry she could do something about it for a role) and her hair and makeup. I was so distracted by the preposterousness of her in this, that it did help distract from all the other problems. What a terrible script.

I thought it seemed rushed and felt like things were left out or not explained. I didn't read the book but it just didn't seem like a complete story as far as the movie goes. When it comes to the cast, the acting was good with the surprising exception of Jolie. Not only was she not suited or believable for this role, her acting chops seemed to have diminished. I found her to be wooden and her scenes to be fairly boring, which we can blame the writers for some of that. Honestly, the most exciting parts, other than the fire of course, had to do with the assassins, played by Aidan Gillen and Nicholas Hoult. They were great and seemed to have fun with their roles. I would have liked for a longer interaction with them and Jake Weber, who played the dad. We barely got to know him before he was gone. It would have been nice to learn more about him and his role in all this other than the quick explanation we get when he's talking to his son, Connor. Sadly, Bernthal's character wasn't very interesting, which is too bad because I really like him as an actor. His onscreen wife though, played by Medina Senghore, was much more fun to watch even with the small amount of screen time she was given and Finn Little did a really good job as Connor.

465,Sweaterized,"Disappointing, To Say the Least",5,30 May 2021,"With names like Jolie, Weber, Hoult, Gillen, and Perry, I was expecting a lot more from this ... this ... movie? To be sure, the acting itself wasn't bad (and in the case of a central actor -- Finn Little -- pretty outstanding), but otherwise this was about as cliched and sophomoric as one might expect from a film school final project.One early scene, I think, captures many of the problems with the movie. As we see Jolie and her firefighter cohorts watching a new recruit swearing-in ceremony (and why were they watching it?), we were supposed to gain some empathy for these rough-and-tough characters. Instead it came off more like a group of middle-school boys trying to act tough and show off their newly found swear words. And that pseudo-heckling of the recruits was the end of the camaraderie establishment of these firefighters. There was a later strange empathetic phone call from one of them, but since they never showed him, it came off more like a benevolent stranger giving good advice. Anyway, I think they missed a great opportunity to show why these people who fight forest fires are worthy of our respect, and to utilize them more in the plot.Overall, it was utterly predictable in plot, and the writing reminded me of George Lucas trying to sound wise and witty but ultimately coming off as cheesy. Cliffhanger with Stallone had roughly the same plot and setting as this movie, but established character and relationships so much better. Can't believe I'm saying this but ... go watch Cliffhanger instead of this weak attempt. You'll have much more fun.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

469,svynronin,Not Very Realistic,6,24 May 2021,"Watching it free on HBO to kill time the film was entertaining enough despite several times you'll be asking, ""what?!"" That's because several things happen that make no sense. Here are a few examples, the killers kill a family in private then draw attention by blowing up the house, lightning conveniently strikes the tower so the radio can't be used, the killers kill people at will which only draws more attention, besides killing a dad they kill a bystander but leave her truck on the road with a huge blood stain on the window rather than drive it off the road, the cop sees it but doesn't radio it in, Angelina Jolie, despite being a trained firefighter runs in an open field with lightning, (every Boy Scout knows that's stupid), she gets struck by lightning by the way with few side effects but a messed up foot, none of the other towers or firefighters seem to care when they're unable to contact her tower despite a raging fire, the boy and Angelina survive in a small creek with a raging fire overhead despite the fact the heat or smoke inhalation would have killed them, we never find out why the bad guys are after the boy's dad, and the main bad guy gets away, and....yes there are plenty of more reasons. If you want a good film that's similar watch but better, Only the Brave or Shoot to Kill with Tom Beringer. Only the Brave is a great firefighter movie while Shoot to Kill is a fun show in the woods with a killer.

There is a person-sometimes a damsel, sometimes a child-that needs to be saved from some very bad guys working for very bad guys. Check.

The Damsel is of course Angelina Jolie. She's lookin beat, old and tired, like a seat cushion in an old work truck. A few innocent victims get murdered along the way. Meh, no biggie. The Assassin squad is complaining about their budget, as I' sure the film crew was too. The acting is good all around. Lots of characters from other Taylor Sheridan films.

That's not to say this is an otherwise believable film, it's full of plenty of action cliches, but it takes a ridiculous suspension of disbelief to believe someone who clearly only weighs about 110-120 lbs has a job that in real life is only available to those who can pass rigorous athletic strength testing. Politics all aside, this would have been a role better suited for a Gina Carano type.If, however, you can get past that as well as the previously mentioned heavy cliches of the genre (drunk guilt ridden hero, odd couple hit men antagonists, etc.), then it's a fairly enjoyable film, though a fair bit under par when measured up with Taylor Sheridan's past work. The story doesn't attempt to break any ground and the cgi is standard at best, but the protagonists are all likable enough to keep rooting for and the antagonists, while never properly fleshed out, have their own decent entertainment value.

Gotta give it to that kid.The ending sequence was mostly believable and I didn't have many issues with that. Straightforward stuff. Plot was simple. Nothing fancy. And it was a thriller. And it had enough action for that setting. No car chases. No hand to hand combat. Just some bad people with guns and FIRE! You get FIRE as a main antagonist here, which has the emotional challenge arc with Angelina, that she has to overcome. Simple. Nothing to bash around.It was good entertainment. Angelina is a tomboy who has PTSD and spends her entire life with a group of rugged men and that explains her character. I'm sorry if people wanted plot twists and action sequences. Well there's a pregnant lady kicking some ass and that was definitely fresh. FIRE! That was fresh. Something different. So yeah, solid stuff. Nothing phenomenal. 7.5/10.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

A smoke jumper in Montana is still suffering mentally from seeing children die in a recent fire, when she comes across a child on the run from two hired hitman who are trying to silence a dark, mysterious secret that some powerful people want to keep from being revealed.The pace is unrelenting once the action starts, the dialogue is solid, and it keeps you engaged from beginning to end. The script writer Taylor Sheridan is a well traveled man who loves the West such as Wyoming/Montana and has a unique way of showing the beauty and dangers of it in a way that's compelling and not dull. It's probably the case he takes some liberties to the obstacles the characters encounter in nature, but it's a movie. Not the best of his, but a solid entry.The people hating this movie have suddenly become the next Bear Grylls since spending a whole year in a 600 sq foot apartment and watching Planet Earth. You'll notice this pedantic chant amongst the negative reviews that ""its not realistic"" or ""this scene was not realistic, that did it for me.""

553,biermani,This is not a movie about wildfire-fighters.,3,26 May 2021,"I watched this mainly because I liked previous Sheridan movies like Hell Or Highwater and Wind River, the trailer made it look like a movie about wildfire fighters with some thriller/crime aspect.All characters in this movie lack any substance. Jolie is the wannabe tough girl traumatized by a firefighting incident, her (male) colleagues are nothing more than foul mouthed rough boys and there's really nothing more to them. Aidan Gillen and his buddy (forgot his name) play evil villains who go around brutally killing people that cross their ways on orders of some company that we hardly learn anything about. Then there are the father and the boy who only tell a little bit in the car before dad killed by the villains and the boy is on the run....... Then there is the policeman with the pregnant wife who also cross the villains. We know nothing about them, apart from that they are a bi-racial couple and she knows how to kill bad guys.......nice, I guess.Jolie helps the boy, and it's very predictable where all this will end. Oh, there's a wildfire (started by the villains, of course) which serves not much more as just a background. Lots of swearing, shooting and killing and there's your R-rated movie.Not much more about the boy or his fathers secrets, we see helicopters fly over the Montana forests, zoom out, end credits.Very disappointing, and if you want to see better scenic shots of Montana I'd suggest you watch Yellowstone, which also has Sheridan's involvement.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Why I say, she's unbelievable, I don't mean ""OMG, she did such a great job!"" I mean, she's BAAAAAD, as is the majority of the story-line.Seriously?! The waifishly thin Angelina Jolie is supposed to be a smokejumper...riiiiiiiight! This movie asks the viewer to believe that she has the ability to carry their gear (it can weigh up to 115 lbs.) Yeah, she's relegated to cabin duty for the majority of this flick...but still, she's still supposed to be one of these firefighters...nope! Their gear weighs as much as she does! There are female smokejumpers, but absolutely none of them...are built as twig thin as she is.As soon as I saw that I had a hard time with this movie...she is completely miscast. She may be fit, and she may even have a little bit of muscle after working out...but she plays the same friggin character she does in EVERY SINGLE ACTION FLICK SHE DOES. She's the same damaged, attitude riddin, darkly flawed character she always plays. (YAWN!)So many other actors could have and should have been cast to replace her...such as John Bernthal, he would have been great in that role instead of casting him in such a bit part...give the guy a chance. This role did not have to be female, nothing in the story hinges on this, but if it had to be for some odd reason...pick someone with more meat on her bones, someone with actual substance to them who could be be believable.Aside from this, the story itself is just poor.

The lead is supposed to be a veteran firefighter, the kind who easily wears makeup during a firefighting drop, yet she acts like losing a civilian and a colleague in a wildfire is the most unlikely-to-ever-occur, blame-myself-forever event. The watchtower she inhabits gets struck by lightning the first day, destroying everything inside - you would think, what with it being an iron tower, that would happen before and someone would invent a lightning rod by then? Her only means of getting out is wildly unsafe and even though she falls two stories, on her back, and communications are off, nobody thinks to check up on her. But don't worry, she gets struck by lightning later again, and she doesn't even get fuzzy hair. Like that time she gets beaten to a pulp, only to appear a little bit panda eyes smudged a few hours later. The lady who uses a spray can to pull the fire out of the fireplace and towards an assassin (who instantly knows she used a safe word when asking if the kid is hungry, somehow), doesn't get her hair singed even a little either.

I also really loved his work on Sons of Anarchy. So I saw the trailer for this movie that was again set in Montana, and I got really excited. Then the movie started. The characters are criminally underdeveloped. I forgot Angelina Jolie's characters name five minutes into the movie. All we know about her is that she was traumatized by being on able to save kids in a fire. That's it. The Writting tries to give her character personality but with her delivery it just doesn't work. There was obviously some history between the sheriff and Angelina Jolie's character, but that also is not explored. Her redemption arc is cut short because we don't get to see what she does with the little boy after she saves him. I thought they would have her adopt him and that would've been a better ending than just going to black. Tyler perry randomly showed up in the movie for less than a minute and we don't know who he works for or what they're trying to track down.

Suddenly, the killers are bumbling like clowns. Secondly, the fire is in part quite bad CGI. Thirdly the acting is terrible and, in particular, the boy is just looking confused, not scared, not terrified, not distraught, the whole time. Even Jolie does not look credible and she wears lacy bras to go hiking through the forest. Other characters, like the pregnant woman, the sheriff's wife turned Amazon who rides the horse looking for her husband, is just plainly silly. Finally, the story's plot line is based on some critical evidence uncovered by the people who got killed, but we never know what that is, who are the instigators, will it be revealed and believed?

584,galewilliams,How I wish this were Wind River *SERIOUS SPOILER ALERTS*,4,16 May 2021,"Since I first saw Wind River and Hell or High Water, I have been a fan of Taylor Sheridan's work. His best work - the two titles I named here - are quiet, realistic, slowly built stories that could well be true, with characters we care about, and excellent actors who are up to the quiet but violent stories told.Somewhere over the past few years, Sheridan seems to have lost his way, first by prostituting himself to write the ridiculously, offensively, and unrealistically violent series Yellowstone. That scene where they drive the new ranchhand off and throw him off a cliff, as one of just many who've met that fate -- really? What drug are you taking?Now we have a story that the two of us here at home discussed at length over how it could have been better, but as it was, we have two paid assassins in a relentless quest for information that has clearly ceased to exist once it came into the hands of a teenager, only in the form of a folded piece of paper, which then endures near-drowning, gunfire, actual fire, mud and running -- how much of that folded piece of paper would remain? How many TV outlets would credence to a boy with such a story, with no other witness? No thumbdrive? None.Then we have the stupid physical aspects of the film - a woman firejumper who not only is not an expert marksman, but does not own even ONE gun, when posted in a remote outpost, with no defense against coyotes, wolves, and bears? Really? And no toilet? Really? And no woodstove for cooking - only a small one for heat - Really?And Angelina Jolie hurtles down a wire with deep cuts in her hands, not once, but three times - Really? Is she Supergirl? Really? And she is STRUCK BY LIGHTNING BUT DOES NOT DIE-- REALLY??And Jon Bernthal wears a heavy bulletproof vest, but still is fatally shot-- Really?And the forest fire is not started by violent lightning, which would have been logical, but by a stupidly steadfast assassin, who must know that he will soon be trapped in that same forest fire? REALLY??And the assassin is shot at least four times, but still does not dies and keeps pursuing his victim - a boy - until he is finally shot in the head? Why not call it quits and say you couldn't find the kid?And Nicholas Hoult - really? Let's have him get halfway hacked to death by a hatchet not very well wielded by a woman who's clearly not up to such a violent task? And then the woman who bizarrely does not even own ANY guns, leave him to die half dead in a forest fire? REALLLLLY??And so I wonder, why has not Taylor Sheridan, one of the fastest-rising skilled screenwriters in the business, not hired a good solid editor who will say NO to him?Because really, if you're looking for someone, here I am.I wanted to give this movie 10 stars, but it really is only up to four.

I wound up loving the book very much. It was very thrilling while also having a lot of heart. I know movie adaptations aren't always perfect but to me, this movie had a lot of potential and it really missed the mark and didn't capture the heart nor thrill that made the book so great.

598,lunty-28700,Switch off your brain and you might enjoy it,1,7 June 2021,"Not a terrible b-list cast apparently propped up by a decidedly average performance from Jolie. The story line is rehashed, tired and in this case beyond stupid. Bad guys find a single picture in the good guys house and immediately determine where he is going, then send a single two man team to neutralise this incredible threat to their operation, apparently without any backup or in fact any real confirmation he is even going there.Inevitably they turn out to be 100% correct in their wild hunch and set up a reasonable ambush, only to find that the targets car switches between all but bullet proof one minute, to being made out of tinfoil the next. Bad guys then inexplicably decide that starting a forest fire will be the best idea to cover their tracks, before heading off into the same forest to track down the kid they haven't yet found.....Needless to say, untold levels of stupidity follow on before we end up with the inevitable, and entirely predictable scene where Jolie faces off against a bad guy mere meters from a seemingly static forest fire while they exchange dialogue and a fight scene that was beyond comprehension what they were trying to achieve. Then Jolie and kid run full pelt from the fire that has now decided to no longer be static, and instead is moving at just below a fast kids running pace for dramatic effect.All wrapped up at the end with further completely mind melting stupidity in the almost happy ending. Overall an utter waste of your life. Take the 100 minutes and instead google learning to crochet or something. Or just stare at the wall for 100 minutes which would be about as entertaining and nowhere near as confusing or frustrating.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Classic overblown Hollywood tripe.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
601,frankarodman,It could have been a great film...,3,20 May 2021,"While the premise of this film is a standard one, the cast and mountains of Montana could've made it better than average. Instead, it suffers from too many implausibilities. Right off the bat, we have the Hollywood version of two killers with no conscience. And they do a pretty good job. However, they blow up a house and the resulting damage looks like the house was made of plywood. The second target suspects he may be next so he leaves town with his son. The killers show up to his house and grab his laptop - which wasn't even password-protected. Really? The target is a forensic accountant. And we are to believe he doesn't even do basic computer security. Then, they somehow do a swami number and figure out where he and his son are going from a picture on the wall. Obviously, among the dozen or so photos on the wall, the one showing his brother-in-law in Montana must be the place he's running to. From there, it gets worse. We are to believe that, of all the roads in the entire state of Montana, the two killers happen to pick the one road the target is driving down. Although they check registration on other vehicles as they pass by, magically, the killer on the road knows the next car is the target. The car is shot up and runs off the road. Insted of hitting the gas and trying to drive the car through the woods to get away, he waits for the two killers to come to the road edge before trying to get away. The teenage son runs into the woods. Inexplicably, the two killers fail to chase him. Instead, they wait until a vehicle comes by and stops and then shoot the innocent young woman for no reason other than to show they are really mean guys. From there, we have Angelina Jolie jumping out of a watch tower and falling 15 feet to the ground, getting knocked out, but no after effects. Of all the places in the forest, the watch tower gets hit by lightning. Even worse, a little while later, after she finds the teenager, as they are running across a field she gets struck by lightning. Our two killers somehow find out where the brother-in-law, a deputy sheriff, lives out in the mountains. His pregnant wife is the only one home. She runs a survival school. Yet, she went to the door with no weapon. However, she grabbed an aerosol can and later has the opportunity to light it up and flames the face of both killers. Amazingly, just bit of red skin on one face and a bit of burnt skin on the other face. In reality, getting blasted in the face with flaming aerosol would've blinded both. The pregnant wife grabs a deer rifle shooting it out with the killers in the cabin and escapes. Again, inexplicably, the survival school instructor doesn't wait outside the cabin for the killers to come out and pick them off. Instead, she disappears for several minutes of the movie. Later on, she gets into a shoot out with one of the killers and takes him down. That is, after this particular killer had been run over by a car and shot in the face with flaming aerosol spray. While the views of the forest were beautiful, the CGI fire effects were a problem. It seemed the director could not get enough of the idea that a fire has a life of its own. It can fly through the trees at 10 to 15 miles an hour. And it somehow is able to create a blast furnace effect over water. In the end, this is a below average film. Angelina Jolie, with her dyed long hair to make her look 10 years younger, is simply not an enjoyable character. The plot of the story is poorly fleshed out. While the killers are definitely mean, they engage in unnecessary, wanton murder. By the way, Tyler Perry appears for about three minutes in the film. A total waste of time. The end result is a film that could have been really great. A lot of attractive elements, even Angelina Jolie could've stepped up and provided a sympathetic character. But, we are left with a less than average action film that simply has too many Hollywood isms instead of realism.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

What I learned: Fires run at 20 mph, and similar to bears, run even faster downhill. When being chased you can't out run it, don't bother trying. Instead find the closest river. Get in and hold your breath underwater for the time it takes for the fire to get bored and move on. Lighting is a different beast. When attacked by lightning the thing to do is run. Be prepared for multiple quick session strikes. My advise is to find a partner and take turns running from it. This will confuse it and hopefully cause it to move on. However, if you are struck, lay down and play dead. This will cause the lightning to move on and find someone else to attack. But what I learned most was that Fireman are a complete frauds. I was under the impression that they were the ones putting out the fires. After watching this film I now know that fires simply burnout on their own overnight. Fireman just show up the next morning and take all the credit. If you watch this film hoping for an action thriller you will be disappointed.

640,gary-33380,Decent enough for a action flick.,8,3 October 2021,The movie was decent enough for me to watch three times because maybe I missed something with the plot line sure enough I didn't the only thing that left me clueless was the fact they didn't go into detail who the hired killers were and who they were working for the only thing I did get was the father who was on the run with his son and explains to him that he's a forensic accountant so it had something to do with stealing government money that's the only fault I will give this movie but for the rest of the movie Angelina Jolie was good as the troubled smoke jumper who has regrets for not saving three boys and has recurring nightmares and she was up for this rugged role and Finn Little as Connor the boy who soon learns to trust Hannah for her skills as a fire fighter to survive and soon conquer their own personal tragedy and bond with each other and Medina Senghore as the pregnant wife of a sheriff who almost loses her and unborn child's life at the hands of two thugs and proves she can hand out the pain to her captors so don't mess with a pregnant women in all the movie is not over the top like fast and furious 9 and holds it own with other action flicks and supporting cast was excellent so I will give this movie 8 out 10.,Those Who Wish Me Dead

It's like they assumed we wouldn't notice or care.And, by the end of the movie, I had completely forgotten Tyler Perry was there. His scene was completely unnecessary.Also, honestly why didn't they tell us what all the murdering was for? Or what was in the paper?

Definitely an R rated movie with some overly harsh language for the first 30 minutes. Hotshot fire fighters do tend talk like that so I guess it fits. Angelina Jolie did very good and delivered a believable performance. Not giving anything away but I did want one last comment at the end of reassurance. If you watch it you will know what I mean.

Why couldn't we see what it was? What was with the Tyler Perry cameo? Did it bring anything to the movie?

I know it's an action film, and time is alloted, but the inaccuracy is laughable. ""i wonder why you are so skinny"" line, was a nice line to welcome Jolie back.Personal ideas: Jolie looks good. She needs a good film for her amazing emotions that she can portray.Overall: good, but lacking. I needed more from the actors in an intense situation. Without it, I cant buy it.

The best thing about this movie is Finn Little in the role of Connor. The recognizable actors and actress are just ok and one in particular is barely in the movie. The ending is so lackluster in closure that I just looked at my wife with a look of ""WTF!?"" Story itself was very predictable which doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie, it's the execution and the ending that made it almost unbearable. The SFX weren't even that great but better than a lot of the overused CGI we see nowadays.

I think something is missing in the narrative department that' keeps this one out of the same league as Wind River and Hell Or High Water.Maybe the harmony between the landscape and the characters doesn't match up to the others or it's something else, but there is definitely something critical that is left to be desired.I still give it a 7 because it's totally watchable and enjoyable if you're a fan of Sheridan and/or neo-westerns, but it's definitely his least recommendable movie I think so far.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

She made a misjudgment in her past, but I don't understand if that backstory's ""learning from a mistake"" supposedly helps her and Connor survive. The movie doesn't really explain the motivation behind the 2 baddies reason for their murder-for-hire, or even their competency as hitmen. They had to be the world's worst cleaners...and Tyler Perry?

I do my damnedest to rationalize things and not nitpick all the holes and logical inconsistencies. But I just had to throw my hands up in frustration and give up by the halfway point of this movie. The things they expect us to buy into are ridiculous. Forest fire watchtowers built with no lightning protection. A man engulfed in flames who comes away without even a singed hair much less the very clothes that were burning on him 10 seconds earlier. Lightning storms producing bolts that strike ground every second in an open field rather than the trees a few dozen yards away. The same bolts chasing the people until they finally hit one then stop immediately their job now done. Except the person struck just gets up and walks away. And the biggest of all: The story begins with a father fleeing with his son from assassins trying to kill him to stop him from exposing the criminal accounting records. His plan is to drive across the country THEN contact the press with his evidence. Why drive across country first? Better yet, why not just publish everything to the internet as soon as he knows they're coming for him? I guess the producers didn't have money for writers after paying AJ.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Yes the fire effects were cool, and some cool shooting scenes, but that's where my praise stops. This movie starts out on the premise of two highly elite assassins blowing up a home and they continue to take people out in a small town. When their mission hits a bump in the road they meet with their no nonsense boss Tyler Perry (Haaaaa), sorry Tyler Perry as a no nonsense boss is funny, and he tells them to finish it. Let me cut to the end. You never learn who any of these people are or why these people are needed dead. I feel like that is the biggest piece of the movie and it's just left out. This movie ends and you are just upset bcuz nothing ties together and there is no damn point or reason to anything.

751,edwardalvarez,Those who wish Jolie's death...,4,15 May 2021,"This phrase came to my mind after watching this movie. If Angelina would be the one reading of thinking about this movie title, maybe - very certainly- she would be thinking about the producer/director/writer and everyone involved in making her appear in this mediocre action wannabe film. Im completely certain Angelina did it just for the money and everyone who got her into it was after her name to get the most income out of her name instead from a good movie.No plot, no history development, no thrill, no emotion, no action, no climax and no ending. That's what you get with this movie. So, those who wish Angelina Jolie's death, must be all of the above. Hope she buries this movie waaaay down under her portfolio and in a few years, when it comes out by any means or is mentioned, she can politely avoid it and leave it just as a movie she did post-pandemic and when she needed to work, wether for money (guess not) or simply not to fall into audience oblivion.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

760,gw-17340,Infernos Collide,9,14 May 2021,"First up, I am a Bernthal fan. So.Taylor Sheridan's work has been on my radar for a while now... he tells narratives about the USA with a level of self-reflection often absent in that empire's chronicles. This time, he coalesces the ravages of fire in a clime-altered green space, with the corrupt violence of elite-driven governance. Here, the infernos of market-world collide, debased human power and fractured nature. Into this, the existence of ordinary people is thrown into sharp relief, where trying to tackle corruption brings hostility and brutality, and doing one's job brings trauma.That Bernthal is often in Sheridan's cast makes this a must see on the big screen. Both are inching their way into the larger consciousness.I think a lot of the low scores and hate reviews are about how the USA is depicted here; that is, Sheridan's perspective on elite privilege and violence. This is his running theme, to show the west as it truly emerges. Entitled and cruel.Elsewhere--e.g. DC or Marvel universe--there is so much dross to distract from the reality of western life, but this director tells it like it is.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

We know that Tyler Perry's character seems to be the head of this cover-up, but then he is never seen again nor is it ever explained what happens to him or why he wants lots and lots of people dead. Even innocents who see the assassins faces have to.die .. so perhaps if they provided some context as to why, this movie might have been intriguing enough to sit through. I expected a payoff at the end with the news report but alas, the credits rolled and we are left with lots of questions (such as why did I sit through this) And what was with all the filler scenes.. sitting at the picnic table and lots of flashbacks throughout the movie of one scene that could have been one and done.

It begins with two guys blowing up someone's house while in search for something the viewer can only assume is evidence that will implicate some unknown person(s) in some unnamed crimes/scandal.The director then leads the viewer down the typical hero/heroine sub-plot where they are in angst over some past event that has caused them some trauma. Hats off for at least laying out the backstory to Angelina Jolie's character.Amongst some beautiful scenery we learn that another person and their son are on the run from the same culprits who blew up the house in the beginning. Unfortunately for the man and his son, the evil doers were able to deduce exactly where they were going to head to through a photo on the wall, and ultimately set up an ambush on the only apparent road leading to this location. Foreshadowing his demise, the father writes down details which will explain to the authorities what these criminals are trying to obtain and gives them to his son, instructing him to only give it to someone he trusts. After killing the boys father, the story really takes off as the boy wanders through the wilderness. Meanwhile, the bad guys attempt to find the boy at the local sheriffs deputy's(played by bad mamma jamma Jon Bernthal) house. After a gunfight with his pregnant wife who manages to escape, they end up subduing the deputy and force him to help track the boy through the wilderness. By this time our heroine has found the boy and attempts to help him after the boy gives her the letters, which she silently reads, further keeping us in the dark regarding the supposed conspiracy that is occurring. Eventually, even with all the vast wilderness before them, the criminals with the deputy as their hostage stumble upon her fire watch tower. After sending up the deputy to look for the boy, and realizing they are inside, the bad guys shoot up the watchtower seriously injuring Jonny while ol Angie and the boy escape, try to run, but realize the forest is on fire and must head back towards the tower. Eventually the six month pregnant wife arrives on horseback( only after turning down a dirt bike and a four wheeler) to the watchtower, kills one of the bad guys, climbs it, and discovers her severely injured husband. She stays with him as the fire engulfs the woods around the tower they are in.Angies character realizes that she has to make a stand so she sends the kid off on his own while she stays behind to take care of the last bad guy. During her battle the kid predictably returns to the scene so that the bad guy can slowly approach him and give the heroine enough time to sneak attack the villain and injure him enough that she can then let the back drop danger element finish him off instead. After a daring attempt to escape the fire that moves at the speed of a rushing locomotive the two end up in a river where they submerge themselves and shelter in the water until the fire passes by. In the morning the two are miraculously rescued along with the deputy and his wife who are still somehow alive, even though every tree around them is burnt to a crisp, yet the wooden watchtower building is not. Furthermore it is as if somehow around that tower the heat defied physics and the incredible amount of heat that would have occurred all around these people didn't cook them alive like sausages over a campfire.Then to wrap it all up as fire crews, US Marshall's and news media arrive to hear the boys story and why all of this drama happened, the movie fades out to a nice folly song and a scenic view of a charred mountain as we sit there wondering what was the on the paper, what caused the criminals to cause so much death and destruction, and what the point of it all was.Long story short, other than the occasional scenic panoramas this movies plot line was absolutely predictable and horrible to boot, and is a big waste of time. Having Jon Bernthal play a weak deputy who is easily overtaken by ""Peter Baylish"" from GOT is absolutely unbelievable, almost as unbelievable as Finn Littles poor attempt at an American accent. Taylor Sheridan needs to stop making movies until he can acutely create something original. Until then he should go back to acting. Viewers will appreciate him more as a reincarnated Jacob Hale from Sons of Anarchy then as a sub par director with a weak plot line for a movie.",Those Who Wish Me Dead
786,wolvescrows,Not that good,2,19 May 2021,"I have been fighting Wildland fires for almost 20 years. So I was excited to see this film. Boy, was I disappointed. Jolie has never been an actress that I like to watch anyway. Her acting in this is sub par at best and that wig is awful. Did this movie actually have a plot? If it did, it was hard to figure out. I guess having a forest set on fire, a car accident and a boy running from 2 killers with no reason is a plot that many may enjoy.

We felt something was missing or unnecessary at every turn throughout the film. Tyler Perry showing up was silly, as were the villian's fake law enforcement badges.

I was genuinely concerned for the characters. The script was not a lot to work with and for what it was, the actors brought depth. I think the audience deserved a little more closure with regard to the people behind the cover-up. What happened to the horse? What happened to the memory stick or whatever Dad gave to son? Could not have made it through being soaked. Could have wrapped it up a bit if she had offered to take him in in the end.

The best part what seeing the pregnant woman fight off the bad guys, but I did not at all enjoy seeing a pregnant woman get punched in the face and thrown to the ground and then threatened with a hot iron fire stick, nor did I enjoy seeing Angelina Jolie get relentlessly punched in the face both by men, (and I don't mind male to female fights depending on the circumstance), although her come back was very satisfying.

The only two people who supposedly were survivalists really had nothing to do with protecting the boy, and the wife was the only one who really showed any skill whatsoever. Angelina Jolie was like a bad immortal that couldn't be killed. Jumping out of the back of a truck with a parachute, falling off the fire tower ladder rope and landing flat on her back from God knows how high, and finally surviving being struck by lightning. The real low point was when the wife shoots one assassin twice with a deer rifle, and he's still alive, warranting a third and final shot.

The plot is as hallow and the writing as lazy as can be and all the character's decisions don't make sense at all. The CGI of the fire looks like straight out of a video game instead of realistic. At least not a single tree was hurt in the making of this movie. A strong acting of Bernthal, Jolie and Finn (the kid) earn this movie a good 4 stars, but everything just seems like an excuse for few pointless action scenes that result from questionable decisions. Neither the bad guys nor any of the other main or side characters (except for Jolie's) develop any kind of back story. Finally, the movie just ends out of nowhere without a conclusion or any satisfaction for the viewer, leaving the watcher with many open questions and the plot unresolved. There is literally nothing memorable about this movie.In spoilers:
The dad (does he even get a name?) has information that can apparently bring down a major criminal organization (we never learn, who, what and why) that fits two crumbly pieces of paper (what's written there?) and decides not to send this to all news networks but rather drives through the whole country to.. Well, we never find out, what he wanted there! In the end, Jolie's character can apparently have an interview based on these two papers, which (we can only assume, as it's never resolved) brings down the criminal organization.The bad guys at first seem to be absolute professionals, even with a bigger team behind. Just from seeing a picture on the wall of the home they can exactly determine a street the dad and his kid are going to drive a day later (*what's the chance???* - lazy writing). From this point, they mess up basically everything. Even though they are in charge of eliminating infringing info, all they focus on is killing the two instead of looking for/destroying documents. With two guns pointed at her, they manage to be overthrown by a pregnant woman (or rather punisher) with a spray bottle. They keep the policeman alive only to make him track the kid - so suddenly they need help with this? They let him go into the tower alone and hide in a tree from which they can't get down fast enough, enabling an easy escape of the woman and the kid. They basically do all the mistakes we all hate in a movie (walking away from their beat down target without watching if it gets up / with a gun, going close to the target that carries a close range weapon...).",Those Who Wish Me Dead

Then again, what note? It was written in ink and well sitting in water all night destroyed that for sure. Also, did they forget that Arthur is still in charge of what ever government sector? Yes, we have to assume that the boy's news interview brings charges against this guy. If he didn't already send another crew to find the boy. Second, they could've ended with Hannah sitting at Conner's high school graduation and then fading to black. Lastly, was Jack a freaking terminator? Hit by car he has very weak limp. 3rd degree burns to the front of the face os now to side of his face no singed hair or clothes and this guy is still going then shot 3 or 4 times before he is finally dead. The story was the dad and the information he had and seeing him and his son escape and survive should've been the story. Not a kid losing both parents (one off screen).

877,bumpygoose28,Too many loose ends!,4,25 May 2021,"Overall I did enjoy some of this film. The plot was an interesting one but there is a lot wrong with it. Firstly, the film makers do not get the balance right between Aiden Gillen and Nicolas Holt hunting down the kid and the fire raging in the forest. Secondly, there are so many loose ends. Did Jon Bernthal survive? What was written on the letter? Why was Tyler Perry just thrown in as a cameo? What happened to Finn Little now that both of his parents are dead? Also who was the woman at the start of the film who was blown up in the house (it can't have been Finn Little's mum because he says he watched his mum die of cancer). So many unanswered questions! Terrible acting from Angelina Jolie (constant use of the term ""Buddy"" to garner sympathy works once or twice but christ, not all the way through the film! However, this was another solid performance from Jon Bernthal and not a bad performance from Finn Little. Other than that, this film is not worth the watch.",Those Who Wish Me Dead

I wanted to see the people who sent in the bad guys in the first place get their comeuppance. Didn't happen. I wanted an explanation why the house that was blown up in the beginning and why whoever was in it were killed, didn't happen. I wanted to know more about Tyler Perry's character, strike three.

You don't have to be an operator to roll your eyes at that.Third, what they do with Bernthals character in the end adds absolutely nothing to the movie. There was no point to it, it was simply disappointing; much like the rest of the movie.Hollywood wants our money, they want us to help the movie industry recover?
