0,SnoopyStyle,nice old fashion espionage thriller,8,19 August 2021,It's 1960 and the Cold War is heating up. High level Soviet official Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze) is concerned. He risks everything to contact the West. CIA agent (Rachel Brosnahan) suggests using an amateur as a conduit. They recruit everyday salesman Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch) who has done some business behind the Iron Curtain.This is an old fashion espionage thriller. It's heightened by its true story nature and the two lead performers. Greville's regular everyday-man character is very compelling. The two men's friendship is very interesting. It may not be something new but it is very well-done. The last part is a little flat but that has to do with its true story nature. This is a throwback in the best sense.,The Courier
1,kosmasp,Collector,9,6 July 2021,"Real life stories can be tricky. In the horror genre they can fail miserably ... in the War scenarios or spy and real people stories, it does look differently though. Like with this one. And while I reckon one could argue that side characters feel shallow or one dimensional (the wives for example), I'd argue there is not enough time to get and have everyone have their moment.Still the British wife we have here, does have some zingers and you can really feel her pain and understand her anxiety over all that is happening. Even if she has the wrong idea of what is going on. Having said all that, the actors are fantastic and the tension is really holding up throughout ... you may know where this is going (and what happened with Cuba and the missilie crisis), but it won't take anything away from what we see on screen.",The Courier
2,lee_eisenberg,governments will use anyone as a patsy,9,22 June 2021,"Most people have heard of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Probably less known is the story of Greville Wynne; I had never heard of him until I saw ""The Courier"". Basically, MI6 used this businessman as a patsy in their espionage operations. As to why a businessman would be willing to do business with the Soviet Union, maybe he thought there was money in it, or maybe he thought he was helping his country. But whatever the case, he became a pawn in the Cold War.Benedict Cumberbatch does an excellent job in the role, as do Merab Ninidze and Rachel Brosnahan in their roles. Definitely check it out.",The Courier
3,blanche-2,Benedict hits this out of the park,10,21 April 2021,"Benedict Cumberbatch stars with Rachel Brosnahan, Zelijko Ivanek, and Merab Nindze) in ""The Courier"" from 2021.The film takes place around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Anyone who lived through it knows it was a terrifying time. MI6 receives correspondence from a Russian colonel, Oleg Penovsky, who has information that makes him concerned that Khruschev is about to start a nuclear war.Two people from MI6 (Brosnahan and Ivanek) recruit a businessman, Greville Wynne (Cumberbatch) to go to Russia as part of his business and begin to build accounts there. That's all he has to do, and he's given a special tie clip to wear. This is so he can be recognized by the colonel (Nindze).The two become friends, and set up a clever way so that Penovsky can slip him photos that Wynne brings back to the states. Wynne's frequent trips cause him problems at home with his wife and son. Meanwhile, the Russians have missiles in Cuba aimed at strategic spots in the U. S.This is based on a true story, and this film has everything - great acting, suspense, drama, and one of the most incredible scenes ever filmed toward the end. Cumberbatch is brilliant. He has the most dramatic role and boy, does he live up to it. Merab Ninidze as his Russian contact is wonderful, and the two men have good chemistry together.This film will stay with you after it's over.",The Courier
4,Quinoa1984,a movie worth seeing that may fall under the radar,7,2 April 2021,"A superbly acted and fairly involving ""Based on a True Story"" spy movie jam that is good, but one can't help and consider could have been a ""Great"" column entry with a Spielberg (yes yes even with Bridge of Spies) or even Tarantino at the helm. This isn't to say director Cooke does a poor job or even incompetent, on the contrary he has excellent staging and a more than fine cinematographer with Sean Bobbitt framing some intensely emotional beats and moments throughout (one where we see a freak out in a prison all through the tiny peephole in the door is one notable one for me), but there doesn't seem to be much time for a major set pieces or two or three for a sequence to stand out.This is an inherently suspenseful story, yet until about two thirds in it rarely has time to slow down for a scene to last longer than thirty seconds to a couple of minutes (a scene where the Brit and Russian watch Swan Lake in heightened emotional responses is an exception), so while it is all good and grown-up entertainment it could do with letting us feel in a more concentrated way what Wynn has to go through when he is doing his Not-but-Kinda springs, albeit this is more of a MP (my problem) than YP (yours) as far as taste with these sorts of thrillers. All this said, Cumberbatch has one of his finest roles since the Imitation Game, and I was quite keen on every moment with Brosnahan, Ninidze (who if he wasn't on The Americans he should have been) and Buckley (who reminds me in a great way of Rita Tushingham from that same time period this is set).It can't help but go ultimately to some of the conventions of a story like this, like how characters talk about what to do about A B or C, and a reminder near the very end of the Good Times I guess(?) But if you're wanting something with the air of the now late John Le Carre and it's playing in theaters and you are in a healthy way to see it, it does well for a weekend matinee.",The Courier
5,studioAT,The Courier,7,26 August 2021,"A surprisingly good watch, with it being nice to see Mr Cumberbatch in a role that isn't a Marvel green screen epic.I recommend this film.",The Courier
6,CinemaSerf,Run-of-the-mill spy affair.,6,15 September 2021,"Ok, so I'm not sold on Benedict Cumberbatch - his acting gets less remarkable the more I see him on screen, and here he does little to enliven this Le Carré-lite spy drama. Based on a true story, it depicts the courageous escapades of Briton Greville Wynne who was co-opted by British Intelligence and the CIA into working with a Russian soldier based in Moscow, to help share secrets that might avert a nuclear war over the placing of Soviet missiles in Cuba. Insofar as it is a true story, it is interesting but I found the whole presentation of the thing rather dreary. Again, the factual elements of the story rob it of any jeopardy - we know what happened/happens and so it's the depiction of the risks taken, the genuine threats to those involved and the seriousness of their mission that should have made this compelling. Sadly, though, Dominc Cooke's film just never really gets out of third gear - and the supporting cast, including his opposite number in ""Penkovsky"" (Merab Ninidze) add very little to what is essentially a single hander for which, in my view, the star isn't up to holding together. It doesn't need a big screen, and will make for an adequate late night thriller on the telly, but unfortunately it offered little more.",The Courier
7,zardoz-13,Behind the Cuban Missile Crisis,9,14 June 2021,"Sometimes, the most extraordinary people are the most ordinary. For example, take real-life English businessman Greville Wynne. British Intelligence approached this civilian with an audacious proposition to act as a courier between MI6 and one of their greatest undercover assets, a high-ranking GRU Colonel in Soviet Intelligence who had access to confidential material. ""Hallowed Crown"" BBC mini-series director Dominic Cooke and ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" scenarist Tom O'Connor have chronicled Wynne's brief career in ""The Courier"" as a go-between behind the Iron Curtain. Mind you, Greville looked nothing like James Bond. Heavily mustached and hopelessly out of shape, Wynne imbibed more alcohol than necessary. Furthermore, he looked so nondescript you could pass him on the street and never give him a second glance. When MI6 recruits him, they are searching for an inconspicuous salesman who won't attract attention. Initially, such an offer captivates Greville, but he thinks twice before he accepts it. One of the reasons that changed his mind is the prospect that the Soviets might rain down their nuclear arsenal on England, and everybody from Greville's wife to his son Andrew would die without enough body parts to justify a coffin. The threat of a nuclear holocaust dangled like the Sword of Damocles over not only his homeland but also his family. As it turns out, Greville played a key role in the infamous Cuban Missile Crisis that pitted the two superpowers-the United States and the Soviet Union-in what could have been a nuclear Armageddon. If you saw Roger Donaldson's ""Thirteen Days"" (2000) with Kevin Costner, this superb saga chronicled the political showdown between U. S. President John F. Kennedy and feisty Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in October of 1962.Although it eschews martinis shaken but not stirred and gravity-defying martial-arts acrobatics, ""The Courier"" is still a nerve-racking ordeal from start to finish, and the filmmakers don't tamper with the historical details as they might have. This PG-13 thriller never runs out of suspense during its gripping 112-minute runtime. The performances and attention to atmosphere make it a splendid addition to other realistic British espionage epics in the mold of John Le Carre's bestsellers that became notable movies like ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" (1965) and ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" (2011). Benedict Cumberbatch, star of the BBC-TV's ""Sherlock"" and ""Dr. Strange"" in the Marvel/Disney franchise, toplines as the gregarious Greville, and the role allows Cumberbatch to alter his appearance, so he looks like nobody special. Of course, Wynne has considerable trepidation about his new venture. He fears he may be caught, imprisoned, and perhaps even face a firing squad. Repeatedly, spymaster Dickie Franks (Angus Wright of ""Cutthroat Island"") and CIA liaison Emily Donovan (Rachel Brosnahan of ""Beautiful Creatures"") assure him he'll never arouse Soviet suspicions.Eventually, when he meets his Soviet contact, Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze of ""Hostages""), the Russian allays Greville's anxieties about capture. Oleg points out to Greville that he isn't technically a spy since he won't know the secrets he is smuggling from East to West. Nevertheless, Greville doesn't share Oleg's confidence. He is dismayed when he cannot discuss his extracurricular activities with his wife, Sheila (Jessie Buckley of ""Beast""), and this exacerbates their domestic discord. Apparently, Greville committed a marital indiscretion in the past and neither Sheila nor he have resolved the problem. Suffice to say, Sheila suspects Greville is cheating on her again, but this time in faraway Moscow.Oleg coaches Greville about the propriety of their relationship in public. He warns the British salesman that Soviet Intelligence will keep him under constant surveillance. Furthermore, the KGB will search his hotel rooms, while bellhops and custodians will keep track of his activities. Greville is told everybody in the Soviet Union serves as the KGB's eyes and ears. He must never say anything in public because the KGB has lip-readers, and he should always take his cues from Oleg. They attend Soviet cultural events, like the ballet, and Oleg introduces him to his wife and daughter. However, Greville cannot join them at supper because the Soviets prohibit foreigners from dining in the homes of their subjects. However, Greville accommodates Oleg when he appears as a part of the Soviet trade delegation in London. He invites Oleg to dine with his family. Eventually, an inquisitive KGB Inspector, Gribanov (Kirill Pirogov of ""Dark Planet""), visits Oleg at his office and questions him at length about Greville. Oleg assures Gribanov that Greville is obsessed primarily with economics rather than political ideology. Gribanov admits that he has perused all of Oleg's reports about the Briton.The turning point comes when MI6 wants to pull Greville from the field. By this time, Greville has grown accustomed to the KGB's scrutiny. Someday, he knows Oleg plans to defect with his family and relocate to Montana. Suddenly, MI6 and the CIA show a complete lack of remorse about Oleg's fate. Of course, Greville could have walked away from the intrigue and its dangers, but his camaraderie with Oleg prompts him to return to Moscow. Greville tells them Oleg would never abandon him in the field, and he refuses to abandon Oleg. This represents a palatable change in Greville's attitude, compared to when he feared getting arrested. ""The Courier"" is a personal story based on actual events. Nothing genuinely alarming occurs in the plot until the final half hour. ""The Courier"" is largely a character driven drama. No innocent bystanders clutter up the predicaments, but the KGB looms as an inexorable adversary. Ultimately, ""The Courier"" achieves significance because it covers the earliest stages of the impending Cuban Missile Crisis. Signs that Khrushchev sought to place missiles in Cuba to counter U. S. missiles in Turkey came from Oleg's messages Greville sneaked back to MI6. Their combined undercover work gave the CIA enough of a heads up to prepare for this contingency. They changed history, and therein lays their importance. Indeed, you'll get carried away by ""The Courier"" and its inspirational history.",The Courier
8,ferguson-6,tie clip,7,19 March 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Spies, and the whole world of espionage, are prime for cinema thanks to the globe-trotting and varied settings, the personality of those drawn to such a calling, and the intrigue and two sides of the work itself - either turning on those to whom one was once loyal, or even pretending to. Director Dominic Cooke (ON CHESIL BEACH, 2017) and writer Tom O'Connor (THE HITMAN'S BODYGUARD, 2017) enter the spy thriller genre with a strong cast and a Cold War setting ... not the first to do so, and certainly not the last.The film is based on a true story, so of course there are conflicting recollections of how this all went down. Oleg Penkovsky (played expertly by Merab Ninidze, McMAFIA, 2018) was part of GRU, the main intelligence agency of the Soviet Union. His front row seat to, and subsequent concern with, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's apparent obsession with starting a nuclear war with the United States, led Penkovsky to reach out to the U. S with classified intelligence in hopes of thwarting global doom. This was the height of the Cold War, with the Cuban Missile Crisis ultimately a key element of Penkovsky's intel.Ambitious CIA Agent Emily Donovan (Rachel Brosnahan, ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"") reached out to MI6 Agent Dickie Franks, who recruited British salesman Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch) to be their amateur spy ... a regular citizen to conduct regular business while procuring valuable documents from Penkovsky. Greville is portrayed as anything but a James Bond-type. Instead, he's a fun-loving family man whose wife Sheila (Jesse Buckley, I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS, 2020) has forgiven him once for marital indiscretion, and is not inclined to do so again.This story occurred not long after Pyotr Semyonovich Popov was executed for delivering Soviet intelligence to the United States. Because of this, the CIA had a weak presence and required Britain's assistance ... enter Greville Wynne. Greville is an odd bird. One could even say a bit goofy. However, Cumberbatch delivers a terrific performance as he transitions into a more complex and courageous man than the one we initially meet.Although the story is not as tightly told as the best spy thrillers, there are two segments that are pretty well done. Watching Penkovsky (code name ""Ironbark"") and Greville get to know each other and then work together is quite interesting - and made even better by the two actors. Also the final act, with both men in KGB prison, finally ups the tension level to what we expect for the genre. The brutal environment and mistreatment is well conveyed, and it's the point where we realize what the risk-taking of espionage can lead to. There are times the film is similar in tone to THE INFORMANT, and other times it recalls BRIDGE OF SPIES, though the latter is a superior film. This was a crucial point in the Cold War, and the film is interesting enough thanks to the cast and real life story.THE COURIER is receiving a theatrical release on March 19, 2021.",The Courier
9,deloudelouvain,"Good acting, interesting historical story.",7,24 August 2021,"The Courier is based on true events, the Cuban Missile Crisis to be more precise. It's an entertaining movie but don't expect too much action scenes as there are almost none. It's more a spy drama about an event that the whole world knows about. The cast did a good job playing their characters. I've never been a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch but I have to admit he can act. He just has one of those faces I don't really like but credits to him, he can act. The Courier is certainly worth a watch, especially if you like historical facts and spy movies about the Cold War.",The Courier
10,blanbrn,Suspense and tense twist like spy thriller.,5,20 March 2021,"""The Courier"" is one entertaining history like film that takes one back to the early 60's and the times of the Cuban missile crisis. As it seems the USA and other countries involved were about to be at a boiling point, only things would change in the form of undercover spies and government work. British businessman Greville Wynne(Benedict Cumberbatch) is chosen from the royal elite to travel to Russia and find out some top notch secrets and what's really going on in the global nuclear world. Also along the way a wild card soviet spy helps both the U.S. and England in the battle. The film is okay for a spy thriller as the scenes are tense with drama as the film builds up with style and grace as it's like you as the viewer were behind the scenes of the Cuban Missile Race, so watch if you enjoy past historical times like these.",The Courier
11,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Smooth, assured production, ticking all the right boxes",9,18 August 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAt the end of the Cold War, despite a placating front, the world is on the brink of catastrophe, as the USSR gains nuclear might, and shows a willingness to use it against the United States. Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze), a concerned dissenter and high ranking member of the Russian army, brings his concerns to the attention of the American government, who appoint Agent Dickie Franks (Angus Wright) and CIA official Emily Donovan (Rachel Brosnahan) to persuade salesman Greville Wynn (Benedict Cumberbatch) to pose as someone interested in doing business with the government, while smuggling out details of the Russian nuclear capability, as the Cuban Missile Crisis looms on the horizon.After surviving two world wars, within a matter of a few years, the world once again found itself on the brink of annihilation, although out of plain sight of the onlooking world. The Courier is one of a handful of films to highlight this uneasy and uncertain time, along with such films as the 2000 Roger Donaldson effort Thirteen Days. It's certainly ripe for potential for cinematic content, with all the comings and goings that went on against the backdrop of it, and here director Dominic Cooke has secured the story another successful blow.Cumberbatch carries the film assuredly, playing the role of the genteel English chap plunged in to a situation way above his comfort zone, almost in his sleep, and it's hard to think of anyone who could have been better than him. A strong, solid supporting cast help keep the boat floating, including Ninidze, Brosnahan and Wright. Director Cooke manages to generate a genuine atmosphere and sense of tension, that keep proceedings flowing with a pleasant ease.With the cinemas back open and running full steam ahead, it's nice to see intelligent, relevant fare like this on the big screen in amongst Fast and the Furious 30 and Marvel's Whatever. ****",The Courier
12,Cineanalyst,Espionage Ballet,6,9 August 2021,"Watched this as an inadvertent Benedict Cumberbatch double feature along with ""The Mauritanian"" (2020). ""The Courier"" was an adequately bland palate cleanser for Cumberbatch's attempted American accent in the other feature--Cumberbatch being about as American as an afternoon tea, a cricket match and Michael Caine. Indeed, he's quite fitting here as an everyman Brit recruited by American operatives precisely for that apparent quality, except in this case it's the CIA instead of Hollywood and the Cuban Missile Crisis rather than protecting the time stone. Otherwise, ""The Courier"" is somewhat tiresome in its ordinariness in the espionage-thriller genre. No John le Carré (by the way, was actually British, too, don't be fooled) here, or even Ian Fleming, or Tom Clancy.Perhaps, the based-on-a-true-story, historical nature of this one was a handicap. The subsequent prison episode may be even more thrilling and intricate than the spy craft. Merab Ninidze's Soviet GRU colonel does most of the work in a relative supporting role, after all. I'm still not even quite sure what Cumberbatch's businessman was supposed to be in the business of exactly. Just an international export salesman connecting clients, I guess... boy, the sounded boring just typing it. For all the talk and shared commonality of the two characters' families, too, those families hardly spark any interest here. One never really wonders why they'd risk their lives in the espionage game, as such dull domesticity doesn't feel like a compelling counterweight. The message of two people from the opposing nations coming together being transformative also rings rather hollow 30 years on from the fall of the USSR.One interesting thing here, but that I've also noticed in similar spy thrillers set in Russia, such as ""Red Sparrow"" (2018), for instance, or even with Black Widow in the MCU, is the analogy of espionage as a delicate dance, or ballet, as it's Russia, of course. Both requiring graceful performances orchestrating fantasies. The problem is that for most of the picture we're primarily following a mere spectator of the dance more so than a participant. Note that we don't even see the ballet in the first theatre scene; we just see the British businessman befuddled as to why he's there. This all changes in the second theatre trip. That's neat. I wonder where this analogy began, as I suspect it's not a recent cinematic allusion. Apparently, there was really a Nazi spy ballerina, but if any film or literary surveillance agents have further information, let me know.",The Courier

16,cruise01,Addicting spy historical film that delivers performances and a strong story.,8,2 September 2021,4 out of 5 starsThe Courier is a good historical spy film that delivers a strong transformation performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. About a plot involving a spy within Russias political office. Leaking information to a courier which played by Benedict Cumberbatch. While the two characters get along and become friends. Does become a thrill and emotional journey when things escalate when Russian officials are trying to discover the spy.Good moving script. Good plot and great acting. It was difficult to look away.

17,eddie_baggins,A gripping Cold War thriller,7,5 July 2021,"We've seen a number of Cold War based thrillers over the years, both fictional and truth and the newest edition to the Soviet littered genre is The Courier, a film that feels familiar and in many ways generic but one that also manages to tell a ripping true life tale in a way that will grip you from start to finish thanks to some smooth direction and a string of quality performances.Feeling like an up-market BBC film that struck gold by getting talented performers Benedict Cumberbatch and the upcoming superstar Jessie Buckley in key lead roles, director Dominic Cooke explores the relationship between Cumberbatch's usually run of the mill salesman Greville Wynee and Merab Ninidze's Soviet spy Oleg Penkovsky, as the two kind-hearted souls look to feed both the M16 and CIA information around the Russian's increasingly volatile nuclear program.This is certainly not the type of Cold War thriller that features feisty fisty-cuffs or bullet filled shootouts with barely a car chase or gun in sight throughout most of the films run-time but just because Cooke doesn't throw in action beats or more Hollywood like set pieces it doesn't mean that The Courier is worse off, as for the most part we as an audience are totally enthralled by Wynee's and Penkovsky's dealings that ended up playing a key-part in the whole USA vs Russia scenario that played out in this dangerous time.The film feels most at home and most competent when its focusing on these two men trying to do the right thing, even if their flirting with danger at every turn they make and key to this is the performances of Cumberbatch and Ninidze who make for a great duo on screen.Taking the inexperienced Wynee under his wing, Ninidze delivers one of his most memorable turns yet as a previously one-eyed supporter of Russia and their quest for world domination and Cumberbatch is as good as his been in years as the mild-mannered but determined Wynee and his physical commitment to his role here showcases a whole new side to a performer still perhaps best known for the quintessential modern day take of Sherlock Holmes.There's nothing done new here and there's nothing we haven't seen done before when it comes to Cold War thrillers but you'd be hard pressed to not find yourself engaged in The Courier's tale and the film serves as a stern reminder of the unsung heroes that often litter these world changing affairs.Final Say -A fast paced and proficient thriller that features some strong leading turns, The Courier may not be groundbreaking stuff but its an engaging and well-made effort that delivers the goods.3 1/2 bowls of prison food out of 5.",The Courier
18,Red-125,Excellent film based on a true story,8,20 October 2021,"The Courier (2020) is an English movie directed by Dominic Cooke. The film takes place during the height of the Cold War.It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Greville Wynne, a middle-class mid-level British business man. Oleg Penkovsky, portrayed by Mereb Ninindze, is a high-ranking Soviet official who knows that there's a real chance of nuclear war.British intelligence recruits Wynne to make a connection with Penkovsky. His job will be to bring back important information that will help the western powers. Rachel Brosnahan portrays a U. S. CIA agent who is working with British intelligence.The film succeeds or fails on the work of Cumberbatch. He's a superb actor, and the movie falls into place on the basis of his acting. (In fairness, he's such a competent actor that I had a little trouble accepting him as a less-than-competent businessman.) Ninindze does good work, but I had trouble accepting Brosnahan as a CIA agent. (Mrs. Maisel, yes. CIA, no.) For the record, I also had trouble with the basic assumption that the CIA agents were the good guys.This movie provides an intense, claustrophobic experience. It's very well done, but at the other end of the spectrum from James Bond spy movies. We saw this film on the small screen, where it worked well. It has a barely adequate IMDb rating of 7.1. I thought that it was better than that, and rated it 8.",The Courier
19,southdavid,Doctor Strangelove.,7,16 August 2021,"Long delayed because of Covid, ""The Courier"" finally received its cinematic release in the UK in August of 2021. A theme of my reviews of biopics is that whilst the subject is often interesting, the actual story of their life is not worthy of being a film, that is most certainly not the case here.With the cold war warming up, Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze), a high-ranking Soviet official, fears the oblivion of Nuclear War. He attempts to make contact with the West. Fearing that any traditional intelligence officer is likely to be under immediate suspicion, a combined CIA/MI6 operation identifies legitimate businessman Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch) as a potential go between. As the relationship between Penkovsky and Wynne deepens, the pair risk more and more for a goal that might literally save the world.To say that I only went to see ""The Courier"" because it worked out timewise with another film I'd seen that day, I really rather enjoyed it. The Sixties period work is well done as is the locational scouting, finding places in Prague and London that look similar to as they did at the time. I wasn't aware of the story of the film going in, so when it came, I was quite unsure whether Wynne and Penkovsky would be able to get out of the country or not. It made for a genuinely tense experience.There is a strong supporting cast. Rachel Brosnahan, Angus Wright, Anton Lesser and Jessie Buckley are all good, but the films two central performances are particularly excellent. Merab Ninidze actively displays all of the conflict he is going through, understanding entirely what he risks by betraying his country, but understanding the risk of unstable men leading the USSR to the brink of annihilation. Cumberbatch though is something else. Yes, he gets to do the showy actor thing of losing a great deal of weight, but it was moments earlier in the film that got me, his face when he decides to go to Moscow one last time for example, just brilliant.Now I know the story, it will not require watching the film again any time soon, but for the performances if nothing else (and it is a solid story) it's well worth your time.",The Courier
20,paul-allaer,Good ol' fashioned Cold War spy drama,7,20 March 2021,"As ""The Courier"" (2020 release from the UK; 111 min.) opens, we are reminded that ""This Film Is Based On True Events"". It is ""Moscow, USSR, August 12, 1960"" and Soviet leader Khrushchev is using threatening language aimed at the US. We then go to ""MI6 Headquarters, Four Months Later"", where the CIA is suggesting to its British counterpart to engage an ordinary business guy unknown to the KGB to extract nuclear secrets from a CIA source in Moscow, and before we know it, British business person Greville Wynne is recruited and agrees... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is only the second film from long-time British theater director Dominic Cooke, whose first film was the gorgeous ""On Chesil Beach"" (starring Saoirse Ronan). Here he goes into a very different direction, recreating one of the more hairraising Cold War spy dramas in quite a while. While it is not a secret to say that all of this has to deal in the bigger picture with the looming Cuban Missile Crisis, anything more than that really would spoil things. In particular the last 45 min. of the film go into a direction I did not quite see coming. But it's all for the better of the film! Benedict Cumberbatch shines in the lead role of the British Joe Sixpack and the supporting cast is quite good as well.

Then a little thing called COVID-19 happened, resulting in the delay of the intended US theatrical release in the summer of 2020, and then delayed again last Fall. The movie FINALLY was released in theaters this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely: 12 people, including myself. That is more than the typical 5 to 10 people that I have seen at most movie screenings in the last 5-6 months. There was a couple sitting a few rows behind me and on the way out, the woman complained to her husband ""I wish it had been a bit more like James Bond.""

'The Courier' though was a nice surprise. It was a reasonably complicated story told in a nice easy fashion to follow. The story was well set out and it was well paced too considering there aren't a lot of action sequences (possibly none now that I think about it).Benedict Cumberbatch is great in the lead role. He's such a likeable guy and there's something fascinating about him. He's very easy to root for. I love how overtly British he is in this movie. The whole cast were great though it has to be said.The only thing I didn't like was a scene near the end where a character was brought in to speak to another character. It sets up a triumphant scene for the heroic characters, so I know why it had to be there, but the scene simply didn't make any sense in the context of what the Russians were trying to achieve.

Benedict is a salesman that travels in Europe on business quite often and they figure that he would be a perfect cover for their spying needs-Merab can pass info to them using Benedict. There are lots of tense situations, as can be expected; who can or can not be trusted, will they get caught, etc. There are real clips shown of Kennedy and others during the Cuban missile crisis and at the end, you see what the real courier looked like.

Based on true events, we are plunged in the Cold War during the early 60's in Britain where Cumberbatch, a businessman, is recruited by British intelligence to be a go between w/a higher up in the Russian power structure who feels Khruschev is going to bring the country to the brink of war. The CIA happily encourages the operation even though it starts to wear on Cumberbatch & his wife's, played by Jessie Buckley, relationship (a past marital indiscretion is mentioned). As fears escalate that both parties will be caught, Brosnahan, a CIA operative, is sent in to facilitate a smooth exit which backfires as the Russian agent is imprisoned (his hidey hole w/his plans on the upcoming missiles being placed in Cuba is found) & Cumberbatch is taken while sitting in his idling plane. The last 20 minutes or so is spent dwelling on Cumberbatch's imprisonment as the ending comes & we find out the fate of our hero. If you know of the incident or history, the outcome will be a nonstarter but since it's a film which dwells in the margins of better presentations like 13 Days (the Kevin Costner film which dealt w/the Cuban missile crisis) or even the Oscar winning Bridge of Spies directed by Steven Spielberg, this film, w/all its solemn acting, great period production design & sheer importance as a facet of history, it can only fall short, which is as shame.

26,aidanratesmovies,Bland melodrama with some superb performances,6,2 August 2021,"Thoughtfully made and poignant, but quite too slow- The Courier is weighed down tremendously by its dull pacing in what could have been an extraordinary film. First off, I have to say the acting in the film is quite good. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as always, and supporting actors Merab Ninidze and Rachel Brosnahan truly shine as well. The story is extraordinary and I appreciate what the film is trying to do. Parts of the film can be interesting, especially in the films first half, but its pacing weighs down the film as a whole and can honestly make it quite a chore to watch at times. The look of the film is rather bland, gray colors and no truly memorable shots, it all feels rather mechanical as it pulls its way through its story and stretches it out as far as possible. I feel like this film could easily be about 40 minutes shorter, and it seems they took priority more on details of the film rather than giving us any major insight into the characters at hand. Nevertheless, t was fine for what it was. A simple 'based on a true story' drama with some great actor and subpar work behind the camera.

It will help to appreciate the gravity of this story.While I'm not amazed it took a very long time for this amazing story to be fully exposed, I am amazed at the story itself. It is one of a very ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers an amazing performance as Greville Wynne. He deserves an Academy Award no less. Merab Ninidze as Oleg Penkvshy brought honor to the character of Oleg Penkovsky and for that, and the sacrifice he portrays there should be a supporting Oscar.Great performances alone do not make this film the must see it is however. The writing and cinematography is excellent. The direction is daft in the lack of all superflous elements.

Review:To get the lessons of history, movies have to try and take us back in time to really get the mood, manners, and lessons to hit hard. The Courier's team manages to execute this quite well taking us back into the 60s during the Cold War, where espionage and information beat out guns, bullets, and bombs. A journey back to the time period that ramped up the spy game for series like the Americans and Homeland, this film manages to bring the fear, dismay, and dare is say cold setting of this time period. The grey filters, the excessive use of shadows, and a daunting nature to European past during this time are all here and it really sets the mood of depression that I think they were going for to envelop you in to the movie. Each act sort of elevates the mood of the times as the conflict between USA and USSR escalated to the point of near total meltdown. It's that element that adds so much to the movie and seems to be the foundation to which much of the actors play off of.
Historical films can sometimes be a tad boring as they try to remain accurate, but give it excitement as it sets up events. Surprisingly though, The Courier manages to deliver a film that is decently paced, diving into the events to set up the situation, but not so fast to deprive the audience of character set up and background info. They manage to cut through the fat quite well, and upon getting over to Moscow, the film's pace kicks into second gear and becomes the spy thriller you are expecting this lesson to be. What I liked about this film, was getting to see the multiple aspects of the events being portrayed on multiple facets. While much of the movie centers on Greville's involvement with his espionage, The Courier manages to mix it with other components including the family aspect of our main characters, the aspects from the organizations involved with the information, the common man's perspective via television and radio, and even a few recreated moments from history. All of these components transition very well together, and help make the audience relive the history at every aspect and potentially appreciate the sacrifices made during this high risk operation. All these technical aspects help give the real life spy approach an entertaining kick, and by the time you get to the ending, the build up from parts of this film really come together to make a climax that should keep your eyes on the screen. I won't say it's the most action packed, but I think it had the energy and finish that a more realistic thriller like this deserved, with just enough suspense to make you wonder what would happen, especially if you don't know the history!
The heavy hitter of the movie is the acting though, and it's led by the main man himself Cumberbatch. Taking advantage of his quirky seriousness, Grevill's part was perfect for Cumberbatch to take on, executing with a style that was deeply emotional and yet funny with the dry humor. An admirable role filled with complicated levels of character, Benedict superbly brings the biography to life and with good writing makes for a strong central character to hang your hat on. Ninidze's performance accomplishes the supporting character as well, a different level of emotions that though are a different involvement in this ordeal, has enough overlap and similarities to compete and complete the gaps in Greville's story. The two have solid chemistry together, and I absolutely love the scene at the end of the film, where the relationship they have comes to a crescendo and should move the audience if they aren't robots. As for Ms. Brosnahan, she rocks as well, another piece who seems to share some facets of the other two to help engage with the characters, but brings a fire of her own that for me represents how you put a strong female character into a movie. The rest of the group knocks their roles out of the park, but I need to move on.Once again the goods are beautiful in this film worthy of the awards it has and could win, but there are some limitations for me that may also impact you. First off, the set up may kick up quickly and we do get to see the set up quite well, but at first much of the spy situations are set up to fall to background noise and a montage of quick simple scenes that do little but allows us more time with the other aspects. This leads to the thrill part of this movie being a little slow and boring for me given how little ""exciting"" stuff shows up. If you like more of the surrounding events, this should not bother you, but if you want a little more of the in depth tension that espionage brings, you'll have to wait a bit. As for the other weaknesses it depends on how much you are sensitive to the polarizing stereotypes that movies sometime show their characters to be. This movie is no exception, crafting a few of the antagonists and stubborn characters in a light that may be offensive in this day of sensitive natures, Some of these are a bit more dramatic than I expected, but it is not the worst case of overdramatization that I've seen . Finally, the last parts of the movie are hard to watch despite the amazing things contained in the final moments of the film. I can't say much, but there might be some moments to steel yourself for in the end.The VERDICT:The Courier is one of those nonfiction movies that checks a lot of boxes off in terms of quality films. It's great acting and setting provide the canvas to go back in history and dunk you into the waters of the harsh reality that the Cold War was. There is a balance between spy thriller and biography that is satisfying and the multiple angle approach really helps elaborate and expand the lives of these historical characters. A climactic finale may not be the most suspenseful mind you, but it works to wrap things up and bring the full appreciation for what these men did back in the day despite the chaos of this world. Yet, the movie could have used a little more focus on the spy features to spruce some things up, potentially pull back on a polarizing personality and interject a little more magic to help bring the stakes of failure a little higher for this reviewer. Given all the factors, this one is worth a watch and if you get a chance to see it in a local theater, than I hope you enjoy it to the level that I did. My scores for this film are:Thriller: 8.0

While this is based on a real event that happened, the people that worked on this movie used their creative license to their advantage resulting in a riveting film.The Courier is about a British businessman named Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is enlisted to go undercover to get intelligence on a nuclear missile attack that's being plotted against Cuba. Under the leadership of Emily Donovan (Rachel Brosnahan) and Dickie Franks (Angus Wright), he forms an alliance with Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze). Together, they try to stop the planned nuclear weapon attacks.The Courier is a very unique film that really dives deep into the topic it's discussing, the threat of nuclear attacks on Cuba. It is based on an actual historical event, known as the ""Cuban Missile Crisis."" When I looked up the historical images of Greville Wynne and Oleg Penkovsky I was surprised that Benedict Cumberbatch and Merab Ninidze look so similar to them. Major props to Alena Garetovskaya, Lucy Amos and the rest of the casting team. Although there are points in the film where I couldn't make out what they were saying, the emotional impact of what is going on is definitely clear. For instance, the scenes towards the end where Greville is in jail and has a conversation with his wife Sheila (Jessie Buckley). Benedict and Jessie both convey their disappointment and tiny ray of hope that both of their characters have. The setting of this film, which is dark and grey, makes the story seem very authentic, because the topic is very dark and dangerous with almost an ominous feel. My favorite part of this film is when Oleg and Greville go see the ballet, Swan Lake. Greville is obviously very moved by the performance to the point that he is crying. The Courier is supposed to be a serious and momentous film and for the most part, it is, but that scene made me laugh.The message of The Courier is to never stop fighting for what you believe in, no matter who tries to tell you otherwise. Oleg knew that he would be arrested and executed if he got caught learning and transporting information about the attack. Greville knew that leaving Oleg to take all the fault and retribution wasn't the right thing to do. Everyone told them that these weren't good ideas and that they would be in too deep. But did that stop them? No. They decided to do what they knew was right, and take the risk. There are some mature and gory scenes along with suggestive language in this film, which explains its PG-13 rating.I rate The Courier 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. If you love learning about history, and love a good thriller, you will love this film. Reviewed by Maica N., KIDS FIRST!",The Courier

It really was very good!This really was Benedict Cumberbatch at the height of his powers, a dominating screen presence, micro detail, nuance, depth of characterisation, emotional range it was really quite brilliant and why this guy is a national treasure.The final scenes between Greville and Sheila, were incredibly moving and show the dark underbelly of espionage and the personal sacrifice made to protect us all.Whilst a niche movie, it had just about everything, masterful direction, fabulous styling, great score, clever cinematography and a great troupe of actors.I giving this a 10 out of 10 for a mesmerising performance from Benedict alone, all the rest is a bonus!",The Courier

In any case, ""The Courier"" was well-researched and developed, and if anyone had merely passing knowledge of the Cold War, this film would surely fill in some blanks. All around, it was a well-photographed, well-acted, believable film with eye-watering set and costume design. You really felt you were transposed back to the early 60's.

But with a fresh Berlin current-day Russian spy scandal in the news this week, seeing the cold war spy drama ""The Courier"" is a timely thing to do.Positives:
Benedict Cumberbatch is outstandingly good in this. He could have been born to play the slightly bemused English gentlemen of the time. All golf, tweed suits and gentlemen's clubs. No spoilers, but there is a physical transformation as well that's impressive to observe. The film would have been decidedly so-so I think without that core central performance.The film is based on a true story. As someone who was born in 1961, it's a good reminder to count our blessings that you, me and everyone else are still around to live our lives at all. The world was on the brink of a precipice and learning the story of Wynne's part in this was insightful history.There's a nice catchy Russian-themed score by Abel Korzeniowski.Negatives:
I'm a big fan of Jessie Buckley. Really, I am. And to be fair to her, her performance is really good. I particularly liked a scene where she dismissed on the doorstep a local busybody. But I just didn't see her as Wynne's pearl-neckless-wearing wife in this part. Perhaps the problem is that although there's a 13 year age gap between the leads, I always imagine Buckley as being much younger that her 31 years. For whatever reason, the casting didn't work for me.Summary Thoughts on ""The Courier"": As a true-life spy story, the movie is interesting and Cumberbatch's performance is brilliant. But I can't say that I was 100% grabbed by it. While having a few moments of high drama and tension - particularly one on a plane - I never felt that to be maintained for enough of the movie. Director Dominic Cooke has a limited filmography (with the Saoirse Ronan movie ""On Chesil Beach"" being his only other feature) and writer Tom O'Connor is the guy behind the more flippant ""Hitman's Bodyguard"" films. Perhaps a more experienced writer/director team would have elevated this to a higher level.So it's eminently watchable but not memorable.

Yes, it has some character moments that are understandable, and Cumberbatch's impression feels really close to the real Greville Wynne (as they show him in the real footage at the end).What could've greatly improved the film, is a more diverse and realistic approach.

So naturally I wanted to watch this movie. And I was very entertained by this movie as a espionage thriller.The beginning of the movie was quite comedic because Cumberbatch's character was a regular British salesman that got hooked into this spy stuff. His reaction was pretty realistic and funny.Then, the first half and a bit of second half became a thriller. The first half was slower where not too much tension was going on. It also reinforced me about the lurking danger of living in Russia during Soviets era. The thrilling second half was filled with fast-moving scenes, facilitated by the great soundtrack.After this, the movie stopped being a thriller. This was expected from the beginning of the second half. It was shocking and sad to see Cumberbatch's character's drastic physical changes during this part. However, the buildup of the story made the ending immensely satisfying and gave a good closure to some characters.Benedict Cumberbatch again showed himself as a great actor as he gave a lot of emotion and pain to the character and made me care for the main character.As for problems, even though the first half was a bit thrilling, there was mostly buildup, which sometimes bored me. Many themes of the story were explored before, and I wasn't surprised that much as the story progressed.Overall, a solid thriller that helped me learn about an important story that not many knew. 8/10.",The Courier
40,tm-sheehan,Superb performances great true story,9,1 April 2021,"My Review - The Courier.My Rating 9/10Benedict Cumberbatch ,never ceases to impress me with the diversity of the roles he portrays . He's certainly among my top 5 British Actors only last week we saw him play an American Prosecutor in The Mauritanian as well as his other performances portraying characters like Frankenstein, Doctor Strange in Avengers Endgame as well as Patrick Melrose ,a drug addicted Adult child then Sherlock Holmes and of course his Academy Award nominated role as Alan Turing convince me that he's a great actor.In "" The Courier ""he plays Cold War spy Greville Wynne who with his Russian source Oleg Penkovsky played superbly by Merab Ninidze try to put an end to the Cuban Missile Crisis.No spoilers from me except to say this film is based on true events that people of my generation lived through and it was chilling to know how close the world came to total destruction from nuclear war. I was 12 years old in 1962 when the story is set and can recall the general angst and worry that even infiltrated Australia in those days of our relative isolation.This is Benedict Cumberbatch's third film concerning British intelligence, and the second of those films to be set during the Cold War. He previously appeared in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011) and The Imitation Game (2014).His character at first seems so benign just an average successful businessman who happens to be exactly the type that MI6 and the CIA need to pose as a business partner of Oleg Penkovsky in order to gain intelligence relating to Soviet missiles being transported to Cuba.As he progresses from courier to spy we see his strength of character develop and he becomes more useful to the Spy agencies.It always amuses me in these espionage stories how the top brass and consular staff assign these people for spying at great risk to the individual while they stay relatively safe and low risk back at headquarters as occurs in The Spy film about Eli Cohen.It was great to see Rachel Brosnahan give a great dramatic performance as Emily Donovan a top CIA recruiter I've only seen her her terrific role asThe Marvellous Mrs Maisel at first I thought she was the ghost of Patty Duke , such a similar look and voice.The courier written skilfully by Tom O'Connor and beautifully directed by Dominic Cooke is a must see in my opinion.I was impressed also by the very effective score by composer Abel Korzeniowski.Perhaps it didn't qualify for this years awards season but it deserves to be.",The Courier

42,MrDHWong,An appropriately bleak Cold War story that shows how two men helped prevent a nuclear catastrophe,8,9 July 2021,"""The Courier"" is a spy thriller film written by Tom O'Connor and directed by Dominic Cooke. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role, it is an appropriately bleak Cold War story that shows how two men helped prevent a nuclear catastrophe.Amidst the Cold War in the early 1960s, Colonel Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze) becomes increasingly worried about the USSR's intent to use nuclear weapons against their western adversaries. Fully aware of the destructive properties these weapons possess, Penkovsky decides to contact both MI6 and the CIA, where he informs them of a potential Soviet attack being launched from their bases in Cuba. To assist Penkovsky in relaying further information between each party, MI6 and CIA operatives recruit British businessman Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch) to act as a travelling salesman collecting vital intel from Soviet countries to hopefully stop a full scale nuclear war from breaking out.I've always enjoyed a good spy film, whether they're fictional or based on true events. However, if I had to choose, I'd say I prefer the factual ones as I like to see the historical context as to why this story is being told in the first place. ""The Courier"" is set during the Cold War, which is an ideal backdrop for a spy film, and it does a decent enough job of presenting its real life subject matter to curious audiences. Even the most ill-informed people are at least aware of the Cuban Missile Crisis, an incident that is widely considered to be the closest the eastern and western powers have come to an actual nuclear war. What most people might not be aware of is how two lesser-known men were responsible for providing significant information that prevented things from escalating to catastrophic levels. Here, these two individuals have their stories told with respectable poise, depicting them both as family men who each want their children to grow up in a less war-mongering world. This reminded me of the Mutually Assured Destruction principle (MAD), whereby each opposing side would be too frightened to use their nuclear weapons for fear of destroying both their enemy and themselves in the process. While politicians may get all the credit for stopping this from happening, it is nice to see a film like this bringing attention to the two brave souls who risked it all behind the scenes.In keeping with the gloomy atmosphere of Cold War-era Europe, director Dominic Cooke gives the film a rather darkened colour palette. As a result, he shows the pessimistic attitudes people must have had about the state of the world at the time and allows us to better understand how morbid it was to live through. A creative technique like this harkens back to the days of the classic spy films of many decades ago, so much so that this will likely go over many modern audiences' heads. Cooke shows no bias in his film, as he depicts both the socialist USSR and the capitalist UK suffering greatly during these trying times with neither one seeming like they are coming out on top. One scene I particularly liked was where Penkovsky and Greville are watching ballet on stage, intercut with shots of them acquiring new information to bring back home. The scene later ends with the dancers all in formation as the two of them stand up and applaud wildly, emphasising how an entertainment form like this transcends their different cultures, which is a clever touch on Cooke's behalf.Benedict Cumberbatch was a good casting choice to play the very English Greville Wynne, a simple businessman inadvertently caught up in the world of international espionage. Cumberbatch always excels at playing historical characters living through the era of spies and secret agents, like Alan Turing in 2014's ""The Imitation Game"" and Peter Guillam in 2011's ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"", so a role like this feels natural to him. Georgian actor Merab Ninidze also did a convincing job playing Oleg Penkovsky (whom asks Wynne to call him ""Alex"" throughout the film), someone who wants a peaceful resolution without too much bloodshed. I liked watching the banter between these two characters, who are of course based on real people, and it is interesting to see what they are able to learn from one another.Although it may not be one of the best films of its genre, ""The Courier"" is still a satisfying spy thriller with enough surprises to keep you invested. Its historical value is vital to learn about and certainly helps put things into the proper perspective. It's hard to come by a film that is willing to do this in today's world so for that alone I'd say it is worth a watch.I rate it 7.5/10.",The Courier
43,maccas-56367,Good real-life spy-thriller that has a bit of everything.,8,1 September 2021,"If you love Cold War spy stories, or The Americans then you'll probably enjoy this. It's solid, while also being largely by-the-numbers. The period detail successfully transported me to 1960s USSR and London.There are some scenes that are truly special and let the actors shine. Such moments elevate the film above the typical spy-flick. But these moments come and go, never maintaining a consistent quality throughout.The performances of Benedict Cumberbatch as Greville Wynne and Merab Ninidze as Oleg Penkovsky (the Soviet spy who altered the Cold War) were particularly strong. Jessie Buckley delivered a good supporting performance as Greville Wynne's wife too.There was enough tension to keep me engaged, and a twist or two I didn't see coming. Could have been something truly amazing (like the work of Greville and Oleg themselves) though still a solid spy film.",The Courier

Cumberbatch gives one of his finest performances and is supremely committed to the role. It's often a harrowing watch and one that pulls no punches on the brutality of the Cold War. Most of what we see has been done before, however the performances help to lift this one above the pack.",The Courier

But here's the thing: if you tell a familiar story with a solid cast and solid direction, it is kinda hard to go wrong. This movie may not have been remarkable, but it was also better than average.

47,trinaboice,Powerful spy thriller,9,23 March 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This fascinating film is based on a shocking, true story that occurred during the Cold War in the 1960s. The drama that depicts events leading up to the dangerous Cuban Missile Crisis was written by Tom O'Connor and directed by Dominic Cooke. It's a spy thriller in every sense. As an American, I never thought about how Great Britain might be involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis, which was famously known as a Russian-American conflict, so I had no idea how this true story might end for an EveryMan British salesman who became intimately involved in this precarious historical event. If you're British, is the name Greville Wynne famous in your country?THINGS I LIKED:
As expected, Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic and he undergoes an impressive physical transformation. The film was actually released in theaters on Greville Wynne's birthday, March 19 (1919). He died in 1990. The young Keir Hills actually looked like he could be Benedict Cumberbatch's son.
I became an instant fan of Rachel Brosnahan when I first saw her in her award-winning role in THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL Season 1 Recap
The first time I saw Jesse Buckley was in the movie Wild Rose. You can see my review of Wild Rose by clicking here. She continues to pump out great performances in film and on TV shows. Her character could have been just a housewife, but she adds some depth to her role.
Merab Ninidze also gives an excellent performance as Oleg Penkovsky.
The color palette looks very 1960s.
I love secret compartments in desks.
You get to see old video footage of the real Greville Wynne at the end of the movie.
You can actually see the name of Dimitriy Arkadyevich Popov in Tom Clancy's book Patriot Games (A Jack Ryan Novel), a Jack Ryan novel that was turned into one of my husband's all-time favorite movies called Patriot Games. You can get a free trial when you Try Audible Plus to listen to the story.
I thought the movie was going in one direction based on a few comical moments in Act 1, but there is a twist that caught me off guard and left me unprepared for Acts 2 & 3. Act 1 makes you feel like you're watching a movie, but Acts 2 & 3 are completely immersive.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Act 1 moves a little bit slowly as each of the characters is introduced. Things move much faster in Acts 2 & 3.
It was a little unclear whether or not one of the characters actually had an affair. Hint: in real life, he did.
Wigs. Terrible wigs.
The script is bare bones with no fluff. It actually might have benefitted from a little.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Russian is spoken with subtitles
Kids will be bored with all of the politics
Someone gets murdered with a bloody headshot
You see a married couple in bed together after a ""tumble""
There are a lot of political acronyms like CIA, GRU, MI6.
You see a naked man covering his private parts with his hands. Later, you see the full naked backside of a man.You can see the rest of my movie review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",The Courier

50,sweidman-28016,Thrilling with Great Performances,8,27 March 2021,"""Maybe we're only two people...but this is how things change.""Based on a true story, The Courier is the story of an unassuming British businessman Greville Wynne recruited into one of the greatest international conflicts in history. At the behest of the UK's MI-6 and a CIA operative, he forms a covert, dangerous partnership with Soviet officer Oleg Penkovsky in an effort to provide crucial intelligence needed to prevent a nuclear confrontation and defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis. I saw this well over a year ago at the Sundance Film Festival when it was titled Ironbark (a much better name in my opinion). Seeing this again in a theater brought back many memories from the experience I had when I first saw it, so that's part of the reason I do like The Courier. Though not as neat as other spy-thrillers, it does a good job at keeping suspense and attention. Mainly this is due to the great casting. Everyone does a great job. Rachel Brosnahan and Jessie Buckley are good in their more supporting roles. Benedict Cumberbatch gives it his all for one of his top performances yet. But the best comes from Merab Ninidze. In my opinion, he's more of the main character. He has the most interesting arch, not to say the others don't. Cumberbatch is clearly the lead, especially when it comes to the third act. And that's probably why they changed the title of the movie. We have a lot from Penkovsky and I would've loved to see even more.The third act brings it all. The first act is slow are more light on subject. Some of the second act is the same as well. Grenville is still getting into the groove of things which gives it a ""comical"" nature. I like that for some time, but it does get old considering the runtime of almost two hours. A few cuts would've been a good decision. Once the suspense kicks in, it's a thrill till the end. The specific moment going into the third act is handled very well. And the third act, like I said, does the movie justice. Without the work done then to give it true voice, this would've been a fine movie but nothing too special. The movie captures the essence of the time period well through the look and the way characters interact. I've had the main melody from Abel Korzeniowski's score stuck in my head ever since the first watch. It's very good and one of the best from him. The Courier might not be for everyone or be too basic. Again, I have that connection with Sundance that helps. I would suggest seeing it, if not for the story then the performances.",The Courier

director: Dominic Cooke
starring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Merab Ninidze, Jessie Buckley, Rachel Brosnahan, Angus Wright, Keir Hills etcThe courier is about a cold war spy called Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his Russian source who try to put an end to the Cuban missile crisis. Wow what a beautiful and fascinating film.My first few positives would be the great cinematography, intriguing set up and fantastic chemistry between the cast. As well as the performances and likeable characters. The film was visually stunning, largely helped by the fantastic scenery and set locations. There was some interesting tracking shots and close ups used that really made you appreciate the imagery and the beautiful locations of the film. I also thought the set up was interesting, having the Russian source give a mystery document to two complete strangers, really set up the mysterious tone of the film well, and left me intrigued and wanting more. I thought the whole cast had fantastic chemistry with each other. The friendship between Benedict Cumberbatch and Marab Ninidze was one of the strongest elements of the film. They grew as friends and learned more about each other and built their trust. Their chemistry was very charming. Also, Benedict and Jessie Buckley also had fantastic chemistry, their relationship was heart-breaking and authentic. The performances from everyone were also fantastic. Benedict Cumberbatch, Marab Ninidze and Jessie Buckley were fantastic standouts. They delivered charming and authentic performances. Showing tremendous versatility and talent with very demanding roles. I also really liked that the main two characters were very likeable, and family orientated. It made me connect with them on a personal level and they were much easier to connect with.My next few positives would be the charming tone and culture. The building of tension, and fantastic stakes for the plot and characters. As well as great in-depth themes and personal scenes. This film had such a nice charm to it in places. Whether it was the likeable characters the fascinating culture of the 60, s that was well explored or the chemistry between the cast. The film managed to achieve a balance of charm and gritty spy thriller and made it work. The building of tension was also fantastic, the film did an incredible job at slowly becoming more and more intense as the characters struggled to keep their identities hidden. With some excellent tense scenes between soviet generals that were unpredictable and had me on the edge of my seat. The reason why the tension worked so well was because of the huge stakes for the plot and characters. The characters had so much to lose if something went wrong and the threat of that happening increased as the film developed. And the stakes for the plot increased as tensions went up between the soviets and America with the threat of nuclear war genuinely terrifying to watch. I also liked the depth added to the themes and the more personal scenes within the film. I think the themes touched on in this film were excellent. The film really touched upon society's fears of other countries and the conflict between two different countries. But balanced this out with two main characters that were on two completely different sides, reflecting that we are all human and not too different after all. It was a really touching element to the film. Finally, I also really liked the more personal moments to the film, they made you connect with the main characters so much more, giving them some great depth, as the film went into detail about their relationships with their partners.I only had a few issues with the film. The pacing was inconsistent in places. There was some rushed explanation, and there were some inconsistencies with certain characters. The pacing for me was inconsistent in places. There were often scenes that switched from rushing through particular scenes or had slow pacing in places. This just made the film slightly clunky in parts. I also thought they rushed over certain scenes. I think some of the important scenes involving more explanation into the plot were rushed over slightly too quickly, so therefore it was difficult to understand or get a bigger picture in parts on what was going on. Finally, there were also some inconsistencies with certain characters. Where they would either be underused or didn't really feel needed to the plot in parts.My final few positives would be the interesting elements to do with Spies. The intense final act and the emotional weight it bought to the film. And the moving and satisfying ending. I thought the film went into a great amount of detail into how being a spy worked in the 60's it was intriguing and fascinating to me and the number of different things that Greville had to do was intense and extremely detailed. The final act was incredibly intense and very hard to watch. Seeing Greville slowly waste away in prison after getting caught was admittedly hard to watch. It was disgusting how he was treated and really made me feel uncomfortable, which is a huge positive as the film made me feel emotion and connect with the character. It really added a lot of emotional weight to the film, highlighting his love for his family. This just made the ending that bit more moving and satisfying. As he was finally reunited with his family it was very moving to watch, and heart-breaking to see how ill he had become.Overall, The Courier despite having some inconsistencies with its characters and pacing. Is a captivating, thrilling and intense thriller. That packs an emotional punch. With a fantastic cast and a fascinating story to tell.Overall rating 86/100.",The Courier
54,ib011f9545i,very good great performance from Benedict.,8,13 August 2021,"When making a film based on fact the producers face a dilemma,do they assume people know the story,how factual do you make the story?I have just seen this film and enjoyed it a lot.I have not looked at other reviews but expect them to complain the film was not dramatic enough.But it is a character study of the 2 men most involved and also a love story.I have a certain advantage over some people in that I have always been obsessed by communism and spying and real spy stories.I remember my late father saying Wynne was an idiot taken advantage off by the British authorities.This is a well acted and moving film that assumes little previous knowledge of the cold war period.If I must make a critical comment is that some of the figures of speech used were probably not common in the period.For example a junior member of staff is asked to step out (of an office) not sure this is not a more modern term.The glaring example is the use of the word gulag.When was the book the Gulag archipelago published? Late 1960s?People in the early 1960s would have mention salt mines or Siberia not the Gulag I think.I don't remember people talking about the Gulags until the late 1970s.But I am too critical,this is a film worth seeking out.Was Wynne a fool or a hero or both?",The Courier
55,movieman6-413-929510,How the ordinary citizen could be used by the secret service during a war,7,12 September 2021,"The Courier is a new spy thriller directed by Dominic Cooke, the director of On Chesil Beach.The film tells the true story of British businessman Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch), who is seen by the CIA and MI6 during the Cold War as the perfect candidate for their spy mission in the Soviet Union. For the mission, he only has to carry documents back and forth between England and the Soviet Union as a courier. For this he gets the help of Soviet officer Oleg 'Alex' Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze), to try to stop the Cuba Crisis together. For this they can only trust no one, not even their own families.With this film they show in an informative way how the ordinary citizen could be used by the secret service during a war. For example, an innocent person is used to pass on something as simple as information, but does so unknowingly at the risk of his own life. This film shows how the secret service preferred to use an innocent civilian, because they often ran less risk of being arrested. The Secret Service also did not run the risk of endangering someone important. Even though the normal citizen ran less risk of being seen as a suspect, if they were caught they could still face a dark time or even disappear.While the film tries to come across as a biographical story about what happened to Greville Wynne during the Cold War, the film also shows aspects of other characters and what they all went through on their mission to try to stop the Cuban Missile Crisis. . For example, the film loses its biographical aspect when it is about another character for a long time.The costumes of the film cast and the film sets help to convey the places and time in which the story takes place credibly.Benedict Cumberbatch does a good job as the lead of the film. He comes across as credible as someone who basically only serves as a courier of important information without much information. For example, it creates tension when he is not fully trusted by some Soviet Union soldiers. For example, he runs the risk of never seeing his family again, while his relationship with his wife is no longer going well due to his absence. Together with Merab Ninidze, he also knows how to create a bond between two people who try to trust each other. Due to their different origins, this is sometimes made difficult for them.",The Courier

60,danybur,A content account of interesting events during the Cold War,6,2 October 2021,"SummaryThe film is a correct and restrained (perhaps too much) recreation of the role of an English businessman (Benedict Cumberbach) as courier between a high-ranking Soviet informant with MI6 and the CIA during the escalation of the Cold War in the early 1960s. Conceived from a Western point of view, although it avoids the outright demonization of the USSR during this crisis, it relates certain details and behaviors about which I allow myself to doubt.ReseñaA comienzos de la década del 60, la Guerra Fría entre EE. UU. Y la Unión Soviética sufre una nueva escalada, con ambas potencias poseedoras de un arsenal nuclear capaz de destruir a su oponente. Dicha escalada culminaría en la Crisis de los Misiles, cuando Kennedy era presidente y Khruschev (o Jrushchov) el premier soviético. La película recrea el caso real de Greville Wynne, un hombre de negocios de productos industriales, que fue reclutado por la CIA y el MI6 británico para actuar de correo de Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze), un reputado coronel y encumbrado funcionario soviético que decide pasar información a Occidente para desactivar la escalada nuclear.Con El espía inglés estamos nuevamente ante una historia de un hombre ordinario que debe enfrentar circunstancias extraordinarias. Su condición de comerciante de productos industriales libre de toda sospecha hace de Wynne el sujeto ideal para entablar negociaciones ""comerciales"" con Penkovsky en Moscú y de este modo servirle de correo (el ""mensajero"" del título original en inglés). Pero, como suele suceder, las cosas se irán complicando.La película de Dominic Cook adopta una mirada occidental del conflicto; sin embargo, evita demonizar a la URSS como la única responsable de la escalada y señala algunos antecedentes. Es interesante la descripción de la dinámica entre la CIA (con una agente encarnada por Rachel Brosnahan) y el MI6 en el manejo del caso, pero me permito dudar acerca de algunas de sus conductas tal como las muestra el film, así como también de algunas decisiones del propio Wynne; como es frecuente, cobran cierta relevancia los vínculos establecidos y las lealtades más allá de los imperativos de la misión.La película es correcta, quizás demasiado; en general luce contenida, aunque las secuencias donde los acontecimientos se precipitan están resueltas con buen pulso. Desde ya que la recreación de época es impecable. Ninidze hace una muy buena composición de su melancólico personaje. Como suele suceder con Cumberbach, aborda muy bien su papel, aunque su interpretación resulta más convincente cuando su Wynne transita la sorpresa, la contención y la tensión de la primera parte del relato, ya que es un actor que tiende al desborde.",The Courier

Nor had I ever heard of this ""true"" story which was a bonus because I genuinely had no idea what was going to happen along the journey.Overall I'd say this film is surprisingly good because I had no expectations going into it. It feels like one of those films that could have been a ""oscar contender"" had it been bigger budget and released back in November of last year. So its in that group of good but not quite good enough films for awards consideration.The good parts, firstly the story is fascinating from start to finish !! It will definitely help if you've never heard of this story before because all the tension in the film will pay off big time. It's not portrayed over the top and all of it seems pretty plausible, especially the way that intelligence is passed between the spies. Actors are all brilliantly cast, Cumberbatch is obviously the biggest star and main attraction to the film and he is great !! As are the rest of the cast, although a special shoutout should go to Merab Ninidze who plays the Soviet spy........fantastic especially in the emotional scenes between him and Cumberbatch.Directing, pace and production design and score are all decent to good as well !!I do have a few problems with the film. I feel as if this film is a watered down version of ""Bridge of Spies"", its a story just as interesting, fascinating and complex as that film. However I feel that this film feels much much smaller in every regard, whereas ""Bridge of Spies"" feels much more grand and epic.........If ""The Courier"" had a perhaps bigger cast (more A-list stars like Cumberbatch), better director and maybe more money behind the project it could have garnered more attention!!! So I do feel a little underwhelmed in places because this film could have been great however its ceiling of quality is a lot lower. It does maximise its quality, its a shame it couldn't have been better than just good !!Overall its a 70% out 100 its s good film that I'd recommend, one of those sneaky films that come out under the radar with not much attention payed to them.

So I was extremely thankful and felt very lucky to have seen this film in the Zurich Film Festival in September 2020.The film follows the true story both Oleg Penkovsky and Greville Wynn trying to navigate the soviet union in order to bring back evidence for the CIA and MI6 of the looming nuclear war between Russia and America. Normally I'm not too fond of spy movies (James Bond never appealed to me) but this one was was really exceptional.Since this is based on real events, it starts on a slow burn that eventually fires up near the end.Benedict Cumberbatch utterly fantastic as an unassuming, boozy Welsh salesmen turned English spy. His transformation into a full-figured healthy man, to a starved, traumatised skeletal husk of a person is both shocking and mesmerising.Merab Ninidze is also brilliant as this stoic, quiet but determined man with the world on his shoulders, yet always pushing to get his plans in motion.This is the type of movie I immediately wanted to watch again straight afterwards.

Up stepped Sherlock himself, Benedict Cumberbatch to take up that challenge.The director Dominic Cooke has wisely played to his superstar's strengths, using a storytelling style reminiscent of old-school spy thrillers and relying more on intense performances and unexpected twists rather than choreographed action or stylish shots to weave his plot.Cumberbatch is a delight as the protagonist Greville Wynne, an English businessman caught out of his depths after being recruited by the MI6 to spy on Russia during the Cold War.Merab Ninidze as the Russian double-agent and Rachel Brosnahan as Cumberbatch's CIA handler play their supporting roles with dexterity and poise.Cumberbatch continues to add feathers to his cap, displaying his full acting range here along with a Christian Bale-esque body transformation that adds to the character's multiple shades.The fact that the plot is based on real-life events adds further sheen to a hard-hitting, nail-biting and fast-paced narration.A satisfying spy thriller.

69,js-66130,RUSSIAN ROULETTE,8,20 April 2021,"1962, where were you? The United States of America. The Soviet Union. John F. Kennedy. Nikita Khrushchev. The Cuban missile crisis. The Cold War at it's chilliest point. This is the Mount Everest of spy climbs, where the world teetered on the edge of World War Three, and nuclear annihilation was a duck and cover possibility.With such high stakes on the political table, it seems almost comical for a movie to focus on a wispy moustachioed business chap who is lured into the dark corners of espionage as a possible delivery node. Benedict Cumberbatch and his hairy stiff upper lip is perfectly startled and flabbergasted at an MI6 and CIA proposal luncheon, but is soon swapping packages in Moscow, and nervously delighting in his new exciting and very covert life. Greville Wynne, yes real name, was in for the adventure of a lifetime.Though, real life adventures are rather less glamorous than the spy film genre would lead us to believe. Who would have thought? ""The Courier"" doesn't glamourize history in favour of typical Hollywood bombast, instead preferring to unfold the little known story within a much bigger story, in a proper, methodical way. When Greville is presented a special lapel pin by the CIA for his venture, he eagerly inquires if it shoots poison darts. Alas it does not, the accoutrement is merely an identifier. Greville is no James Bond. He is a schmoozing salesman, who's international highlight is a Russian ballet that moves him to tears.Still there is plenty of shadowy intrigue, shadowy tension and shadowy cinematography, and because the players are not household names, their outcome quite in doubt. Don't Google wreck the mystery. ""The Courier"" is a trim and proper spy caper with excellent performances and just the right mix of historical fact and cloudy fiction. A small film about a very big time, that hits the sweet spot like afternoon tea and crumpets.hipCRANK.",The Courier

However, the beauty lies underneath where those moments are without excessive blood shed or violence. I mean, the moments and character portrayal describe the feelings rather gore or abuse.

The story is varnished with some old-fashioned tropes of espionage with no high-octane actions.... however, it still manages to hold the gravitas of somewhat drab later parts of it ..

S and London government's to go under cover in the USSR and gather intel. He is aided by Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Nindize) and they both uncover some secret plans that the Russians have cooking up.The Courier came out in the a very troubled time. It came out during COVID-19. It is a smaller film that should be recognized. It does have a few big names in it but for the most part it feels like a smaller film. These are the movies I miss going to the cinemas to watch. I just felt like going to see a movie so I did and got some pop car sat down and started watching The Courier. I must say, it felt sort of like normal again. Is was glad it did. The Courier might end up being one of the best because this year is being crowded with superhero movies and giant blockbusters. There will of course be those smaller films that get into the Oscar's that everybody just has to see but I think this film might get lost in the mix of all that. The story really made the movie what it is. It is a story you don't really think ever happened but did. Obviously they made some parts more thematic then it should have been but it was still a pretty good story. It did seem to use the same structor most movies use. A lot of films that are about a historical person seem to have the same structor. The end did seem to change it and for that reason, is why I liked the end a lot more than maybe I should have. The story was pretty good though.The acting was another strong suit for this film. Benedict Cumberbatch was hired for the main role and he gave it his all. He gained a ton a weight for the start, then got fit, then he even got skinny. It was bizarre. Jesse Buckley also did pretty good. I haven't seen her in any other movies before so I have nothing to reference. Everybody else apart of this film did a pretty good job too.The Courier had some Oscar worthy acting but the story was a little on the bland side. I would recommend The Courier for anybody who wants to watch a good true story that make you feel good in the end.",The Courier

Things that do not work are the script that is a bit slow, the direction that fails to generate impact during the plot twists and the lack of development of some characters.Although it is understood that it is a biographical film of an important person in history, it fails to try to impress the viewer with what he did and fails to tell a better structured story.",The Courier
75,bastille-852-731547,Serviceable but dull Cold War spy drama,5,18 March 2021,"I'm a lifelong fan of the spy film genre, and the trailer for this looked right up my alley: tense, well-acted, sophisticated, and taut--almost like an early John Le Carré book. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. While well-meaning and serviceable, it feels rather generic and contrived in a way that damages the effectiveness of its storytelling. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Greville Wynne, a British businessman who ends up partnering with a Soviet officer to try to starve off potential conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union in the time leading up to the Cuban Missile Crisis. The acting is generally fine, but none of the performances are especially memorable.One of the film's biggest flaws is its script, which relishes in clichés of how the Cold War has typically been depicted in cinema. These clichés also boil down to the film's aesthetic style and cinematography as well, which generally end up quite unimpressive (which is too bad, considering the trailer had some excellent shots.) The scenes portraying espionage between Wynne and the Soviet officer also seem unrealistic to the point that they distract from the narrative at times (such as showing characters disclose information or talk about espionage-related matters in public places or out in the open.) The film often feels rather generic at times as well, especially since the writing fails to make Wynne seem like an interesting or dynamic protagonist. We know that he has a difficult relationship with family and, particularly, his spouse, but his worldview or actions are never truly developed or evolve in a way that make the story's narrative more engaging. We're not able to feel for him as a character, even when he is forced into comparatively difficult and desperate circumstances. Cumberbatch tries his best portraying him, but there is only so much he can do when the writing is so dull. For a spy film, there is also a relative lack of genuine narrative tension or suspense for much of the story.""The Courier"" isn't a bad film by any means, but it is a film that feels like it plays it too safe while being unable to add anything new to the spy genre. It's such a shame, because I was hoping this would very good. Not especially recommended. 5/10",The Courier

I might add that the casting is strange and does not work for me. Not one charecter in this so-called true story is believable, it is just a great story told very poorly and photographed by a talentless hack. A spy story about the near war events of the Cuban missle crises, perhaps a good idea to see some back story on that moment in history, but this is not it...but really, for me, the photography was so bad it just kills the story.",The Courier

78,andrewrye-06535,So Glad Hollywood didn't ruin this.,7,18 April 2021,"The story has been well covered by others and I don't like repeating what's already been said.The cinematography is nothing short of excellent. Moscow's overbearing and brooding atmosphere of the cold war is captured through the depiction of the brutalist architecture and ever present 'observers'. I loved the feeling of always being on guard whenever the Russian scenes were shown. England by contrast was grey and rainy and cold. Even though the last of summer is departing us I felt the wet chill when the characters ventured out in wet and cold streets of London.I was happy that the movie was actually centered on the character of Greville Wynne and not the actual spying side of things. This indeed is where the real story is. He was the courier (the Title may give you a hint) and so the action and thrills other reviewers complain isn't there, didn't happen for this character. Unfortunately Hollywood all too often panders to these people who can't separate fact and fiction and have ruined so many 'based on true stories'. But this was an absolute gem to watch.I always felt that Greville may have been somewhat naive in accepting this role and the end seems to bear that out. But as a courier, this was probably what saved him. Benedict Cumberbatch does his usual subtle brilliance and is well supported through out. I did feel that it could have been tighter and I am curious that the exchange and reasons behind it weren't included when the Government officials said he wasn't enough to swap for an important spy. Curious and it would have helped to round out the story. I also would have liked to know more about what business Greville Wynne actually did?So a 7 from me, well acted, great scenery but a bit loose in some areas. More please!",The Courier

There is a fine line between Spy Action Thrillers and Spy Thriller Dramas, this one falls into the second category.This is more real and takes away all the glamour from such movies to show you the real serious work that goes on 'behind the scenes', the risk involved, and what's at stake. Very easy to make a plot around a doomsday device which Vin Diesel and his family chase down, but stories like these give you a sense of real threat and the kind of sacrifice that needs to be made.By the end of the movie, you WILL find yourself saying ""Good lord, Benedict! You didn't have to flex on us so hard!"" because that's just how good of a job did playing the role.

Set during the height of the Cold War, the world is on the brink of nuclear war, and the CIA needs the help of MI6 to get an inconspicuous Brit to be the courier for a Soviet officer willing to spill some beans for the sake of world peace. Reluctant at first, Wynne eventually takes on his secret-agent role with full conviction. Besides Cumberbatch, Rachel Brosnahan also impresses as CIA officer Emily Donovan.

88,FixedYourEnding,It's really just Meh,5,3 May 2021,"I disagree with the general IMDB crowd on this one. I thought that the acting from Benedict Cumberbatch and Rachel Brosnahan did not give the depth and seriousness that is required for this kind of grim and serious movie. Of course Rachel Brosnahan was wonderful in Mrs Maisel (If you haven't see- go see) but there she is liberated comic whereas here she has to portray a serious CIA agent and that casting just doesn't work.In general the rest of the story about the cold war, spies, espionage, deserters etc has been told a thousand times already. I found myself not drawn to the story at all even if it has some ground truth behind it, it is just not exciting and the acting did not do enough to carry it. It does not come close to creation such as 'the Americans' which brings a new spin on the cold war and deep, complicated characters. None of it exists in this movie.Not a bad movie overall but it is a far cry from a masterpiece. There are so many better stories out there, I would watch only if you have some sort of personal connection to this story otherwise you will be bored. Exact score: 53 / 100.",The Courier
89,CoastalCruiser,Pop culture dictates mar an otherwise interesting tale,6,16 July 2021,"It's always a pleasure to see Benedict Cumberbatch at work. With the exception of the second Star Trek reboot -where he was miscast- the actor has never disappointed. His performance in this film is completely adequate, inside an adequately told story.What pulled me out of this true story was Rachel Brosnahan's character, Emily Donovan. Clearly Brosnahan was picked to play a CIA agent because the actress herself comes off as very smart, and talks fast to prove it. Like with her role in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, As with that role, Brosnahan lights up Emily Donovan with an obvious intelligence, informing the audience she is one step ahead of everyone else.We first see agent Donovan in a scene where she is power walking through an office populated with mostly men. She walks with a strong yet feminine gate, sporting a highly accentuated, forward leaning tilt, as though no obstacle could deter her from her goal post. Sort of like Zoe Saldana's Lieutenant Uhura walking in to the bat at the beginning of the first Star Trek reboot (sorry for the redundant reference). It worked in Star Trek. It doesn't in this film.I was suspicious of CIA agent Rachel Brosnahan from that point forward. This was a true story, right? Was it actually a female agent in that era that interfaced with civilian Cumberbatch's character? If so, then OK. The writers may have taken a bit of creative license with Donovan, but we can live with that. But if CIA agent Donovan had instead been a male in real life then we are faced with the script pulling off a big cheat in order to satisfy today's dominant movie goer who demands that the movie is carried by pretty young females who are smarter than their male counterparts and innately know karate.So I looked it up. Whoops. There was no agent named Emily Donovan in the real story. ""She"" was a composite of several CIA agents. I suspect that those composites were mostly male, simply because that's the way it was in those ancient bygone times.Sadly, The Courier has sold out to identity politics. Why don't I like that? Because it pulls you out of the story. It's that simple.",The Courier

However the heart of the story is the truth, he helped prevent WW3 and bring a peaceful end to the Cuban missile crisis. So as I thought about that, I realized this man spent 2 years in a Russian detention center under harsh conditions, and the images of him directly after verify that. Why should he not then be forgiven for any misremembered fact, or that his mind replaced a horrible incident with a better one. It doesn't diminish what he did in my mind, and should be forgiven. So that made me appreciate the movie and its conservative use of dramatic license to tell this very interesting story of a normal citizen who became involved in one of the most important espionage events in history. We should thank him.The movie is great, is there anything Cumberbatch can't do? The last meeting of the 2 in prison is an emotionally packed scene with a great music scores.

96,Instant_Palmer,Cumberbatch Continues To Move The Acting Bar Higher,9,28 April 2021,"Benedict Cumberbatch's best performance to date, which makes it one of the greatest acting performances period. His startling physical transformations, spot-on dialogue delivery, and appropriately subtle and highly-effective character manifestations (he's a spy not a Hollywood super-hero for those hung up on the film not emulating Bond or Bourne ""big moment"" scenes), are all testimony to his commitment to the acting craft. He once again proves why he is (simply-put) one of this era's greatest actors.This role should garner award nominations across the spectrum of such ceremonies for Benedict.The Courier is well above average as espionage films go - subtle pacing actually magnifies tension in the story - the most elemental fuel for any thriller.No spy film is better at emotionally connecting the viewer with the lead character - painting an accurate portrayal of both a spy's methodology, and the inevitable inner conflicts and angst involved in the job, and in one's personal life. This unique trait elevates the film.The Director maintains a refreshingly low-key atmosphere in scenes, befitting the ""trade-craft"" of espionage that thrives on innocuous and concealing behavior (rather than the overly dramatic big moments too often leaned upon in blockbuster spy films). None of that nonsense would actually occur as spies would bring too much attention to themselves - a sure way of having a short career and brief lifespan.This is a spotlight film role carried by Benedict, but a film of this immense achievement does not occur without similarly great performances by the supporting cast.Merab Ninidze hits one over the Berlin Wall and deserves recognition for his remarkable supporting role performance.Rachel Brosnahan was spot-on as well, and is clearly on a roll after her deserved critical praise for 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel'.Tom O'Conner's screenplay is brilliant as is Dominic Cooke's directing, and Gareth Scales' editing which somehow brings this fascinating true story to film in under two hours.The Courier has me once again ('Spotlight' being the first in 2015) breaking my long standing rule of not putting a film on the Top 100 All Time Greatest list within a year of its release. I often view better films multiple times over the long haul. Some hold up; some gain respect; and some regress.

Most of his reputation comes from stage and TV work, which includes some legendary performances, but the feature film projects that have been designed to showcase his unique charisma (Star Trek: Into Darkness, The Fifth Estate, The Imitation Game, The Current War) just haven't done it very well.Surprisingly, this well made but very conventional Hollywood style thriller turns out to be the vehicle for what I think is Benedict's most satisfactory film performance. Greville isn't the typical Cumberbatch oddball/genius, so the actor can give his audience the relatable emotions of an ordinary man striving to make the best out of a horrifying situation.

Actual espionage is pretty boring stuff (no hanging from the roofs of speeding trains or dodging a hail of bullets), but the suspense in the movie was palpable. Benedict Cumberbatch gives an outstanding performance as the protagonist, Greville Wynne. This all happened during the height of the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, so tensions were at their peak and the Russians were not inclined to treat spies nicely - and they didn't. Wynne was held in the notorious Lubyanka prison where he was beaten and tortured. But that did not kill him: his smoking eventually did (he died of throat cancer in 1990).",The Courier

Where Cold war was hot.It showcases the true story of a Britisher business rather a salesman named Grenville Wynne who on a request by CIA becomes a carrier/courier.Khrushchev seems arrogant and I write America is no less selfish and exploitative.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Grenville Wynne and looks similar like he looked in the Imitation Game but his acting has improved.Rachel Brosnahan too looks like Mrs Maisel but this time around she is with CIA. Her acting skills keep you hooked.Oleg Penkovsky is portrayed by Merab Ninidze.May be we are two people. But this is how things change.The real beauty about this movie is subtly but how nicely they show the relationship between two professional which turns into bond till death. The sense of die and live for each other, the compassion is unparalleled. I really hope Bollywood and Indian cinema touches this human angle of just two individuals despite their gender to other differences do something remarkably good.Writer Tom O'Connor & director Dominic Cooke meet the standard of a decent spy film.A lot of Anachronism follow which fool the viewers.Cold war espionage by Russian and Americans is interesting to watch and many films are following this pursuit.The trauma that spies go through are immense and not just them but their family too faces a lot.Wynne and Penkovsky smuggled more than 5000 top secret military documents out of USSR and they also helped in easing out the Cuban Missile crisis. Penkovsky is considered the most valuable soviet source ever recruited by the west.I am going to get home to you.There is nothing in this movie that you would have not previously seen.But the good part is it's no nonsense and movie isn't too long like many of it's counterparts and ia available on Amazon Prime Video.

Cumberbatch who play Greville Wynn, an unassuming businessman tasked with bringing out Soviet era secrets from Colonel Penkovsky (Ninidze), a high ranking member of the GRU Russian intelligence. Greville (Cumberbatch) was recruited by MI6 to be a courier for leaked Russian military information during the cold war. His friendship with Penkovksy perhaps (or so the pic goes) averted a nuclear war. Things move to a strong and moving conclusion when both men were captured just before the Cuban missile crisis.

Cumberbatch is very good, as are the supporting cast, but it is Ninidze who really steals the movie.The locations are very atmospheric and recall the days of the Cold War perfectly.And a special word for the soundtrack, which is very evocative of the period.

I wish we had seen more of him and his family while not in the presence of Greville, and I wish the movie had explored his struggle and inner conflict much more.

It was intriguing because I was unfamiliar with their story, and had no idea how it would end. But, there are better spy thrillers out there than this one because the director was focused more on telling an implausible (true) story, rather than making a great spy thriller. For instance, there are many quick-cut scenes with music score but without dialogue intended to convey gradual unravelling of subterfuge rather than detailing events with actor interactions. I think that lessened the suspense we love in spy thrillers. Still, there is strong acting from Merab Ninidze as Penkovsky, who I've never heard of or seen before, but he really reminded me of a famous actor from the past. Benedict Cumberbatch as Wynne turns in a good performance, but actor who played American CIA agent Emily was not credible. There's a jarring shift in tone and subject matter that occurs halfway through the film that, with better direction . could have been more of an evolving process. I still think a good film and head & shoulders above the alternatives.",The Courier
125,Drawmort,This film exceeded expectations,8,8 August 2021,"There are countless movies dealing with the cold war and espionage between the United States and Russia. It is not a particularly original topic. But originality is not an essential requirement for a movie to be good or disastrous.The Courier gives you the empathy necessary to enter the valley of feelings and emotions that the protagonists are showing. It keeps you on the edge of the seat, giving you the desire to know how everything will end (except if you already know how the real events happened). The script mixed with the good editing of the film create an accelerated and constant rhythm of scenes, giving the right tone and atmosphere to accentuate the most important moments.The script is very well written, the acting is good, highlighting the role of Cumberbatch. The setting of the time in which the story takes place is very well done, both on set and digitally, including costumes and decorations.My only weakness would be the lack of rawness in the adverse events in the last third of the film, which takes away a bit of realism, but at the same time, makes it a piece of film for almost all audiences.In short, it exceeded expectations.",The Courier

129,Darvener,"Very entertaining, educational and unique movie with a cold war theme",8,29 September 2021,"Movie 'The Courier' is about a british businessman named Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch) who was recruited by two spies to be a middleman for their new source of information from Russia, Moscow. The story is set in the cold war.At the beginning the movie nicely introduces us to the main characters and how spies get to the point that they need to recruit some businessman to be a courier for their new source of information. Movies about the cold war or about war are many on the market but this movie is different, this movie you will remember and you will have it in your brain forever. You will remember this movie and you will have it in your head forever because of his very good way of cinematography, which is chosen very well by a director of cinematography Sean Bobbitt and by director Dominic Cooke. Is sad that in this very good and very memorable movie, some discrepancies were found and they are related to the director not to the screenplay.This movie took under himself already mentioned director Dominic Cooke who directed two movies 'The Courier' and 'On Chesil Beach' and three episodes of one TV mini series 'The Hollow Crown'. For the years when he started his career in 2012, he gained a lot of experience and now he had an opportunity to take the experience and put it into this movie and he succeeded, because of his great visuals. But there are two things that must be pointed out. First thing is that when they wanted to take a shot on a person's feelings or something like that, they chose a very aggressive focus which is not good for any use.Screenplay was for this movie written by a writer named Tom O'Connor who has written a two movie series called The Hitman's Bodyguard. His career was started recently in 2012 and his second movie 'The Hitman's Bodyguard' was released in 2017 and for this short period he probably could not properly learn from his mistakes but in the script for this movie he showed the exact opposite. For the short period he perfectly learned from his mistakes and he delivered a very good and stunning movie. In this script I've didn't found any mistakes, only pros. Script for this movie is very well written and this makes the movie very entertaining and educational. Characters' thoughts are written very well too.In the main role for this movie was fantastic actor Benedict Cumberbatch who was in the role of businessman Greville Wynne. Benedict Cumberbatch was perfect for this role and breathed life to this character - I'm not saying that the lines for the characters were badly written but you need to choose a good actor to play the character very well. Cumberbatch has done a perfect performance. Other actors have done the performances very well.Camera was almost perfect but the feeling of misplacement was bad, but it was in a few scenes so this wasn't any big problem. By misplacement I mean that the camera could be placed ten or twenty centimeters away.Movie is very well crafted - the director, actors, screenplay and camera were very good. Movie has very good visuals, performance of the actors. Screenplay hasn't any problems and this makes the movie a very entertaining, educational and unique movie with a cold war theme.75%",The Courier

Somehow a promising true story becomes a plod through one formulaic scene after another.Director Dominic Cooke (formerly of the Royal Court theatre in London) lacks cinematic flair, and he's hampered by a derivative score which as usual is lathered over scenes that would have been much more effective without it.I admired Cumberbatch's physical commitment to the role, as the later scenes required, but his effort is out of all proportion to the value of the material.",The Courier

However, Greville survived it with a harsh imprisonment in Russia, Penkovsky couldn't make it out.The movie gives a poignant account of the families of these people who act as spies and sources both serving for or against their government. The friendship that developed between these two men during the meetings is also well depicted.One of the best aspect of the movie is the way it has demonstrated few emotions; when they are sitting in the theatre enjoying the ballet, and with every passing tune of the music they were being terrified, that maybe this is the best thing they would enjoy for the last time in their life. Then in the jail, when they confronted each other Greville was atleast successful in informing Penkovsky that his efforts didn't go in vain, and he actually was able to stop the war.I truly can't even imagine the pain, suffering these people need to get through in their lives.

Benedict does a great job as the slightly ignorant and unwilling businessman tasked with helping to transport secrets out of Russia. The development of the lead characters throughout the film was great to see and by the end I felt a strong connection with both of them.The soundtrack is very good at keeping up the tension during your typical spy movie moments which was great at the cinema. I was not expecting the third act to go the way it did which isn't a good or a bad thing, but does credit Benedict's acting and adds emotional weight to the story.Overall I would say this is a film which holds its own but isn't a 'must see' and for me didn't have the rewatchability to warrant a higher rating.

""The Courier"" is a true-life spy thriller, the story of an unassuming 'British' businessman Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch) recruited into one of the greatest international conflicts in history. At the behest of 'The UK's MI-6' and Emily Donovan (Rachel Brosnahan), a 'CIA' operative, he forms a covert, dangerous partnership with 'Soviet' officer Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze) in an effort to provide crucial intelligence needed to prevent a nuclear confrontation and defuse 'The Cuban Missile Crisis'.
On 16, October 1962, President John F Kennedy is handed high-altitude photographs taken from 'U-2' planes flying over Cuba that shows 'Soviet' soldiers setting up nuclear-armed missiles on the island. 'The United States' have been tipped-off that 'The Soviet Union' is putting nuclear warheads on 'The Caribbean Island'. 'The Cuban Missile Crisis' sees the world on the brink of nuclear war. Greville Wynne has a sense of humour, doggedness, and an unexpected strength. This guy goes on an extraordinary journey. From being an ordinary businessman, one who's quite severely dyslexic, almost to the point of illiteracy, to being a conduit for 'The West' to get the most important bit of secret information during 'The Cold War' and 'The Cuban Missile Crisis'. It's about an everyday guy in the centre of that world with all these thrilling elements and this massive global political backdrop while it's about him and his family, and he ends up trying to save the world. Wynne's mission is to make contact with a 'Soviet' military intelligence colonel named Oleg Penkovsky. They strike up a significant friendship. Penkovsky likes him and trusts him. And Penkovsky sees that loyalty returned when Wynne tries to help him escape. Wynne returns to Moscow even after being warned that he would put himself in peril by doing so.
Wynne decides that he has to help his friend Penkovsky escape. 'The KGB' catches Wynne trying to help his friend, and he's arrested on 11 May 1963, and subsequently is sentenced to 8 years in jail. And then we get the tragedy of this very ordinary man being stretched to the limits of his endurance, physically and mentally in a 'Russian Gulag'. What he endures is all the more incredible considering he isn't a trained spook and he has no background or inclination to do the work he's asked to do. He's released from jail in exchange for the spy Gordon Lonsdale (Jonathan Harden) in 1964. The prison experience changed Wynne. He falls into a state where his mental health is challenged. He becomes an alcoholic and leaves his wife. He lost his business income and so, needed money. Then there's the secrecy that's part and parcel of espionage so 'MI6' never acknowledge his work even after he's released. 'The British' government never publicly acknowledged anything he did or thanked him for what he has done. ""The Courier"" culminates with Wynne shaven-headed and alone in prison. The film hints that even when he's released all will not be well. He's a broken man no longer at peace with himself.
Oleg Penkovsky is a legendary source that 'The Americans' have in 'The Soviet Union'. Penkovsky, codenamed 'Hero', is a 'Soviet' military intelligence colonel during the 1950s and early 1960s. Born in Vladikavkaz in 1919, his father died fighting as an officer in 'The White Army' during 'The Russian Civil War'. He has to hide parts of his past because he's related to a man who's the enemy of 'The Communists'. He has to carry this on his back. Penkovsky is able to detract attention from his family history by proving his belief in the cause by joining 'The Soviet' army. He's very well respected in the military world but after the war, no one cared about this anymore. He has all of these medals, but he's just a high-ranking bureaucrat. This guy is fearless, narcissistic and self-obsessed. He's like a forgotten actor who wants to have a big comeback. His ego is also what make Penkovsky think he could get away with being a whistle-blower. He's convinced that this would never happen to him because he thinks he's too smart and by the time 'The Soviets' would find out, he would already be living in Montana, in 'The United States'. The friendship with Wynne blossoms so quickly because they've shared experiences. They understand how much they both risked. There's a need to give each other support. It's quite interesting the idea that if you've someone and you do have a family and it matters to you, how do you manage when a big chunk of your life is off-limits. One of the things that push Penkovsky and Wynne together in the film is that they both share this problem.
Sheila (Jessie Buckley) is Wynne's wife. There's hardly any information about Sheila at all. Sheila has to constantly keep a lid on her emotions. There are a lot of suppressed emotions in the sixties, especially a housewife who's unhappy and unfulfilled in life. Everything is smoke screens and smiles behind pained eyes. Basically, lots of quiet moments which are interrupted with sharp sips of martinis. Emily, 'The CIA' operative comes up with the idea of using Wynne to get information out of Moscow. She's a composite of a few of the real-life 'CIA' officers who worked the Wynne and Penkovsky operation. Emily is fictional, in the sense that at the time, the officers who worked on this operation are all men. Being a woman operating in a very patriarchal world, Emily has to be very strategic and clever to get her own way. Emily needs to use plenty of wiles to manipulate the men around her. Her male superiors need to believe that they're calling the shots even when they're implementing plans conjured up by Emily. Is it patriotism alone? Is it a desire to prove her worth in a male-dominated world, or even a male-dominated profession? Did she have a personal connection to this war that drove her? To get what she wants, Emily must appear non-threatening. That's largely a period thing, but also a battle that women still fight today. Emily believes that she's the smartest person in the room or at the very least, she has something valuable to
This film is about the history of 'Russian American' espionage. There's a long history of successful great 'Cold War' thrillers, the difference here's that rather than being about inscrutable people with inscrutable motives it has a clear emotional heart, and it's essentially about a relationship between two men who did something extraordinary. In October 1962, 'Soviet' ballistic missiles were being deployed in Cuba. President Kennedy demanded their removal. When Khruschev refused, both sides began preparations for a nuclear war. For 13 days, a policy of brinksmanship saw the world facing the threat of nuclear war. The world was going to end. People crowding into churches who had never been to church. This sent many around the world into a state of panic. The world sort of held its breath, it's not just a fight between two countries, it's every country in between them that would be affected. The film incorporates the crisis into the screenplay. Just trying to get a sense of that fear and helplessness that people felt that the world might end and there's not a 'God' damn thing we can do about it. You had ships sailing to Cuba with missiles, you had 'The Americans armed and ready and you had everybody hovering over buttons and codes.
It only takes a few hotheads in charge of the codes, a few polarised opinions and people shutting off and not having a dialogue for catastrophe to happen. A generation had passed since the end of 'The Second World War', and new functional architecture had been appearing around the globe. The clothes were changing, but the swinging sixties had yet to arrive. The film shows the competition between 'The Soviet Union' and 'The United States'. Both superpowers were pursuing initiatives trying to demonstrate that their way of doing things created a better life for their citizens and more advanced technology. There's this big epic feeling of the architecture during that time because of the competition between the two countries, particularly in the sixties with 'Brutalist' architecture and 'Soviet' architecture. There was no nuclear war that such a scenario was not only feasibl but that many feared it would be inevitable. ""The Courier"" seems to be part of our history. The drama feels immediate and visceral. In the past four years, with Korea, Trump, China, and the pulling up all the old nuclear treaties between Russia and America, ""The Courier"" feels a little bit urgent in a rather scary way.

145,InCole,Best film of both 2020 and 2021!,8,23 June 2021,"So this review is going to take a slightly different approach. I wanted to touch on some of the arguments made by people who have reviewed this film with lower ratings on IMDB.One key point I see coming back is that people are calling this film formulaic, generic, a rehash of other better spy films, boring or just generally bad and bland film.I just cannot for the life of me get how someone can watch this film and make those claims. Spy films are one of my favourite genres and I have seen them all. My first introduction to spy dramas was North by Northwest this was back when I was about 10 years old my dad showed me this film for the first time and it blew my mind as a kid. The suspense, the mystery. I wanted to watch it again and again until I understood it. The week after he showed it to me I popped that VHS tape back in the player and must have rewatched it every day for an entire week until I understood it all.Now North by Northwest is pretty much universally agreed upon as being the great grandfather of all spy films so considering that was my first taste of the genre I think I can safely say my bar is set pretty damn high when it comes to spy films.Speaking more recently we have had some great films such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (I gave it a 7/10), Bridge of Spies (gave it a 8/10), The Departed (gave it a 8/10 as well) and a few others that escape my memory at this time.Now the reason I mentioned these ones above specifically is they all took the spy genre and yes they all have certain cliches that as a spy film it is hard to get away from, but the cliches aside they all took a unique approach to making a spy film. I am speaking about the cinematography, acting dynamics, and more importantly - the script.How this relates to The Courier and where the negative reviewers have gone wrong is they have failed to recognise how unique the perspective is in The Courier. Rather than following the trail of spying as in the action and suspense around the actual act of spying or simply by hiding who the spy is until the end, etc... This spy film puts us into the shoes of Greville Wynne.Not only does it put us in his shoes, we see spying from a completely different perspective. We witness the relationship between Greville Wynne and Oleg Penkovsky and the film primarily focuses on that. The spying actually takes second place to the brotherly friendship that forms between Wynne and Penkovsky. A friendship so strong that even to the risk of himself and to his family Oleg never told the KGB the truth. He risked the lives of himself and his wife and children to save the life of Wynne.That is the focus point of this film, the spying comes secondary to this and the action is just a footnote and that is extremely unique for a spy film.Now is this film perfect? No otherwise I would have rated it a 9 or 10. But it is damn well bloody good and the acting is out of this world especially the on-screen chemistry between Cumberbatch and Merab Ninidze.The cinematography is stellar, the directing is perfect, the soundtrack fits very well and really adds to the emotional moments in the film and the script is very unique in how it goes about showing and telling a spy story.Best of all, for the most part the film manages to stay reasonably true to the source material and the real events.So no, I am sorry I cannot agree with the people saying this is a bland or generic spy film. In all the great spy films I have seen I don't think I've ever seen a spy film be so bold as to put the spying as a secondary story and put the relation between two characters as the primary story in the film.What really surprised me was how despite putting the act of spying as a secondary part of the plot the film yet manages to convey the emotion and stress that spying put on the two main characters extremely well. Part of this comes from the excellent directing and part of this comes from the excellent acting by the two stars of the film.In general I like Benedict Cumberbatch but I do feel he falls flat in some films while in others he really delivers a stunning performance. Well honestly, The Courier in my opinion is his best performance yet.",The Courier

Then the USSR and the USA almost started a new global war, however everything worked out eventually. Now we will find who we've to be thankful for resolving the conflict and making the sky above our heads calm again.The protagonist of the film is British businessman Greville Wynne who is involved in financial affairs around the world. Thanks to his charisma and a
silver tongue Wynn finds friends everywhere and now he is recruited by the British special services so that upon arrival in Moscow he would get in touch with a local defector and transmit important information to London.I've watched lots of spy films, but this one's gone deep into my soul. To start with, I really appreciated the stylization, as if the film was actually filmed in the 60s. Besides, I can't fail to mention the actors, Benedict Cumberbatch is beyond comparison, he actually doesn't know how to play badly. I also loved Merab Ninidze as a Russian agent who decided to help England and the United States in the battle against the USSR.So the film is really remarkable, it is a great pleasure to watch it.

The female CIA agent was a fake character, likely to fill the need for a strong female character in the movie.

Our story starts in 60s, in the shadow of the Cold War a letter from Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze) an agency of the Soviet Union received by M16 stating the concern of Penkovsky about world safety and his anxiety about a nuclear war, So Emily Donovan (Rachel Brosnahan) a CIA Agent reached out to MI6 Agent Dickie Franks (Angus Wright) , who recruited British salesman Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch) to be their spy.The Review:
the directing in this movie was remarkable, the Director ""Dominic Cooke"" did a wonderful work in this movie ,Although there are similarities between his dinner scene and a famous episode of Westworld ,but it is okay. He also Succeeded in Attracting viewers' attention during the whole movie, I was never got bored....from first scene to the last one.The Cinematography also was nice. It reflected the general atmosphere of the 60s.All actors really did great performance especially Benedict Cumberbatch , He did a great performance in this movie. Remember sherlock, imitation game ,current war and now The Courier, these are his genre of movies he was created for. Jessie Buckley did two great scenes and of course Merab Ninidze was amazing in the film.I think this movie is more like 'inspired by' a true story not ""built on"" ,I felt that the writer added his touch to the true story.The point is The Courier deserves more than that.

Because as is, I was not really able to emphasize with the characters.The performance, the camera work, everything was good, the story was interesting, but it did not deliver the full ""impact"", that it could, because of lack of background for the characters and lack of the feeling of danger. Yes, there were some scenes, that tried to show the danger and the ""family man"" attribute, but they were too scarce and sometimes a bit forced.As a TV series it could have taken a slower pacing and show how the stress is being increased on all the parties involved through various methods (I even have some in mind, but do not want to spoil the movie itself). And living with the characters outside the main events would make the ending failure more impactful, I think.",The Courier

Unlike so many spy thrillers that are so convoluted you're peeking on Wikipedia to try to figure out who's who, this thriller was exciting yet easy to follow. You're engaged because the film focuses on the developing relationship between the two main characters: Greville Wynne (Benedict Cumberbatch) the happy go-lucky British traveling salesman drawn into espionage and Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze) a revered Soviet Russian patriot who betrays his country to save humanity from nuclear destruction. (Based on true story related to Cuban Missile Crisis) As the warm friendship between these two loving fathers grows, we begin to care about them as well. Because we care, the dangers they face make the film's suspense all the more intense. I won't spoil the plot, but I had to remind myself to breathe as the risks for these men ramped up. Before it was over I was in tears. That's the emotional roller coaster I wasn't expecting when I tuned into this movie I'd never heard of!

189,ajwatkins-695-92473,The Trouble with Tradecraft: The Lies that Keep Us Safe,9,11 June 2021,"""Maybe we're only two people, but this is how things change.""I am......... irrevocably wrecked. Inconsolable, incoherent, stumbling blindly through the words, even as I type them with shaking hands. I wept, I bitterly wept, staring at the rolling credits, and the name I love, struck numb, left empty in sobbing, horrified awe. The emotional upheaval endured in this real life, espionage thriller, by both actor and viewer, was so far removed from what I had expected, that the shock of it, made the following fallout an intensity such as none could viably survive.What I had expected to see was our dashing, intrepid Benedict's origin story as an MI6 spy, cleverly outsmarting the Russians in a bold, daring Sherlock-esque display, ferrying classified information in ingenious ways, shoe heels, false-bottomed cases, and the like, with more style and wicked sharp intellect than James Bond, sleek, sexy thrills, danger, threats that he laughed in the face of, unfazed.This movie is a powerful study in the misdirect, the dire circumvention of audience expectation. What I watched was so much better, so much more visceral than my mind had conjured based on the previews, so much so, that the heart-wrenching horrors, and the linger of the haunting trauma stayed with me, well into the night. How stunningly deceptive of the producers to only show scenes from the beginning of the movie, cleverly presenting an entirely different film, a charming mustachioed Benedict, hob-knobbing with the spy elite, clinking champagne glasses, licensed to kill, with a lethally handsome smile. The James Bond veneer, to a searing look into the real lives of spies, inevitably making the startling contrast more keenly suffered, when the sheen falls away, and that final turn is taken.........The Courier, at its heart, is the story of a seemingly ordinary man, who found within him the courage and resolve to make an extraordinary sacrifice, in the effort to calm the tides of a world in tumult, suffocating under the threat of nuclear annihilation. Benedict tucks away his deerstalker and sentient cloak, and the other trappings of a grand, romanticized hero, to don a more quiet strength of an everyman figure, who discovers the very real bravery, waiting unexpressed, within him all along. That's not to say his adorably disarming Greville Wynne isn't romantic, no, in fact, the passion he kisses his wife with, clinging to her, as though the world will become ash tomorrow, lips pressed fervently to her neck, the tender, cherishing way he makes love to her, once the radiating threat to his way of life becomes fearfully evident, is so beautiful a human moment, that it left me in tears, wishing, hurting for all the world to be her....... To be touched, like it would be the last time.As Greville gets embroiled deeper, and deeper into the thick of an international conflict, undercover in a hostile country, trapped by a world primed for nuclear war, he creates a bond with his contact, a high ranking, Russian Asset, KGB officer by the name of Alex P4nkovsky, a father, not unlike himself, a man who loves his country, but not at the expense of mutually assured destruction. Where our Comely Courier is deemed a hero for his daunting task, his Russian counterpart is considered a traitor, a turncoat enemy to the Russia he's risking his life to protect. It was a sneaking joy to watch Benedict dance with his new Russian friends, doin' the twist like all the other cool kids, and my GOD, that man can DANCE!!! The two even attend a Russian performance together of, ""Swan Lake,"" which I thought beautifully mirrored their own crescedoing dangers, the perfect metaphor, scoring the detrimental risk each was taking.Where Benedict shines BLINDING, however, where reality and fiction get confused to the point of bewildered madness, is when everything goes wrong, and the mustache comes off, as it were. After yet another cruel misdirect and sleight of hand, letting us breathe in relief, as Benedict disappears safely onto the plane in Moscow, crucial Russian intel in hand, unsuspecting, as hell itself descends, the trap closing fast around him and his friend, take-off is maddingly delayed, and our worst fears and suspicions cruelly surface.............What follows is not for the faint of heart.......... I watched, helpless, hysterically sobbing into my hands, begging, pleading them to stop, as they throw a terrified, disoriented Benedict onto the cold, metal table, naked, brutally beating him, having forcibly shaved off all of his beautiful hair!!!! Knowing the kind of immersive actor that he is, knowing his methods, knowing he held nothing back, knowing that he must have told them to hit harder, and insisted they shave off his real hair, as opposed to a trick of film, made this gauntlet of degradation paralyzingly real, and it was screaming, violent agony to watch. When they knocked him to the ground, circling him like a lynch mob, kicking him, thrashing him with crowbars, I could think of nothing, NOTHING but flinging myself on top of him, shielding his body with mine, taking every hit and abuse to spare him such raw dehumanization.The tortures, psychological and physical, the deprivation, the starvation ensue for eighteen months......... and the pain, the terror in his glistening eyes, is attacking my heart, panic coursing through me, making me a mess. It's not a movie anymore........ It's real, it's happening, and it's horrible. Why? Because Benedict makes you FEEL it, you're with him, languishing, breaking alongside him, watching as an already slender man, once cutting a dashing figure, becomes a gaunt shell of his formal self, a brittle, skeletal creature, indicative of his Frankenstein days, spindly, and more horror than human, his cheekbones dark, and sunken in, his body alarmingly emaciated. He's not acting starved, he HAS been starved, and you see the evidence of a talent that the world could never begin to deserve, willing to do this to himself, for the poignancy of the moment, and the payoff is unmistakable. Get this man a bloody Oscar.Here, in this ninth circle of hell, in his long suffering, Greville proves who he was all along, not a mild-mannered business man, but a hero, a martyr, possessing that rare, selfless, resilient brand of bravery, surviving what no man physically could, and it is dizzying to witness. He is offered food, promised a pardon, to confess, and turn on Alex, and still he will NOT bend, his expression stone, as he slides the pen back across the table.In the meantime, using the intel Greville sacrificed his freedom to procure, MI6 assists the CIA in averting what would come to be known as, ""The Cuban Missile Crisis,"" choosing both to celebrate their hard won success, and deny Greville's affiliation, and retrieval leaving him in a Russian Gulag to die. I am aghast...... Anger, fury, frustration......... What do you do........ When the country you sacrificed everything for, turns its back on you?Not wanting to reveal Greville's value to the agency by offering a high ranking Russian officer in trade, MI6 and the British Government wait a YEAR, to barter his return, and when the exchange is made, STILL refuse to acknowledge him as one of their own. It's both a triumph and a tragedy, in that a man, so instrumental in preventing what could have been an act of war, and the end to civilization, is denied the accolade, the recognition, and the favour he deserves. Until now.........This is a movie about real life heroics, about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It's raw, and intense, and painfully genuine. It's a spy movie without all the flash, and flare of the usual secret agent thriller, and it is made all the better for it. In real life, there isn't a deux ex machina rescue, moments to spare, riding off into the sunset with a pretty girl on your arm, in some fabulous car. There are real risks, there are wins that feel like losses, and there are villains that are far worse than those concocted in the realms of fiction. Monsters that look like men, capable of atrocities too terrible to write about.The Courier is the riveting Swan Song of two men from two countries in each other's crosshairs, who abandoned their ordinary lives, suffered severe personal loss, and did everything right, even though everything went wrong. Alex died disgraced, a traitor, executed in prison. Greville returned home traumatized, scarred by a life he never signed up for, denied by the country he nearly died for. Both had to lose, so that we could win, live, and what had always seemed to me like much ado about nothing, has been revealed, through the insightful eyes of this movie, as, in fact, the worse attack in American history, that never happened......... but could have.""There are good lies.

I found myself sobbing from the moment he was arrested, stripped, cavity-searched, whipped, starved and kept in a disgustingly filthy prison cell.Americans should remember this time in history, and how close we came to war.

I was on edge for most of it (in a good way) and Benedict Cumberbatch did a superb job as always.If you aren't normally into spy movies, give The Courier a try!",The Courier
201,es96,Excruciatingly dull,4,23 April 2021,"Good actors, good settings, excellent visuals albeit a bit dark. And extremely slooooow development with no suspense or action. Boring. Uninteresting. Dull. Dreary. Stale. You get the point. I could not feel anything for any of the characters except maybe a little bit for Jessie Buckley's (Cumberbatch's wife in the movie).",The Courier

204,andreev-83318,Impossible to stop watching,8,16 March 2021,"As for me, the most important reference point for watching films is the cast. If I see interesting actors who select roles wisely and don't star in anything, it means that the novelties with their participation are mandatory to see. And since Benedict Cumberbatch starred in ""Spy Games"", such a movie can't be missed.The storyline takes us back to the early 60s. The businessman Greville Wynne becomes a spy in the service of Her Majesty. While in Moscow, Neville gets instructions from a Russian colonel who has decided to go over to England's side, and who would have thought that very soon the stakes in the espionage game would become extremely high. The lives of millions of innocent people around the planet will depend on them.Benedict Cumberbatch's performance is as good as ever. Once again I am convinced that he is one of the best actors of his generation and I can't remember a single bad film with his participation. And as for ""The Courier"", Cumberbatch drastically differs from Sherlock or Doctor Strange. He doesn't play a superhuman, capable of anything, but at the same time he bestows us strong emotions and we really worry about his hero.In general, the film's worth seeing to understand its full dramatic and historical depth. The shot is interesting, there are no unnecessary moments, everything is in essence. These are the kind of films you need to watch and discuss!",The Courier

209,brandon-19950,Excellent performances from a solid cast,8,19 April 2021,"I caught this movie over the weekend. I very much enjoyed it and felt that the story was well told within the constraints of a movie runtime.Solid acting from all involved, and I can't think of a moment in the movie where a character acted other than in their nature to progress the plot, which is always nice.I was interested in the handful of reviews that used words like ""tired"" and ""cliché"" with this movie. Given that it is a cold war era espionage movie, to expect other than was depicted was probably a bit foolish.As the statute of limitations on government secrets allows more of these individual stories to be told, I'm always happy to go back to these times and locales to find out about the unsung acts of courage these people performed at the time.I thought the writers did an excellent job of letting the audience get to know the main characters as human beings and feel the weight of their decisions and sacrifices.Great film, well worth a watch.",The Courier

By his thorough understanding and honesty of his character.On a side note watching this movie. I'm left with the opened eyed disgust and realization of the disgusting inhuman, fascist, Russian regime, Now Run by the inhuman, Lying and traitorous, to his own people, Vladimir Putin.

Most impressive is the lack of ""talking down"", as is typical with historical films nowadays, as well as the excellent fidelity to historical fact, without any agenda or dumbing-down at play.Cumberbatch, as always, was brilliant as a British businessman turned spy, but I thought the Russian male lead was especially impressive - at times almost channeling Solzhenitsyn-esque integrity and greatness of spirit. His performance perfectly sums up what heights a tyranny leads a genuinely great spirit to - and out of what appalling depths.Although it starts slowly, the entire story is gripping, realistic, and done with great compassion and humanity.

I will, however, say this about it- EVERY key actor deserves a nom and a standing ovation for their performance and if this doesn't win at least one Oscar, the award shows are rigged even worse than i thought!

245,isaknordmanrid,Best mediocre movie of the year,6,19 August 2021,"When I walked into the cinema, my hopes were relatively high. I always enjoy seeing Benedict Cumberbatch on the big screen and it felt like this role could do his acting talent justice (as opposed to his appearances in the MCU). But I left the cinema disappointed. Disappointed, because this movie had the potential to become a movie you'd remember.The biggest flaud of the movie, in my opinion, are it's hopelessly flat characters. We never get to know Penkowsky, therefore I can never truly feel for him in the climax of the movie. His choice to become an informant is vaguely motivated, he believes that the Russian president is too aggressive to handle nuclear codes. However, evidence of this is never shown in the movie.The only character trait Mrs Wynne has is her constant worry over her husband. She really is only a tool used to make the viewer feel sorry for Greville.Another issue is the difficulty of realizing the danger Greville puts himself into. If we don't know the stakes, how can we feel the tension? Of course, you understand that it's very important for him not to get caught, but we never know how close the Russians are of catching him. We also don't know what will happen to Greville if he gets caught.With that being said, there is plenty to like about this movie. The cinematography in some sequences is truly excellent. I also enjoyed the slow pace of the movie. Furthermore, the character of Greville is relatively well-made. His actions and desires are always motivated. I also really liked how his character developed through the movie, from a bored, selfish and funny person to the hardened, serious and caring person he becomes in the end.And of course I have to mention Cumberbatche's outstanding performance. He subtle changing of facial expressions give his character the depth it so desperately needs. It is also nice seeing him do another role than the smart, cocky guy who has difficulties understanding social codes.So summarizing, this movie is definitely worth watching, but you'll forget about it's existence after a month.",The Courier

What isn't depicted is the fact that Khrushchev bluffed and JFK finally called his bluff. That was the truly scary aspect of that encounter.Some of the more subtle points of the interaction between Wynne and Penkovsky seem almost unlikely in retrospect. I still wonder how Penkovsky talked Wynne into the espionage business. I suppose MI6 had something to do with it.

273,kazimdas,A powerful performance by Cumberbatch,9,28 August 2021,"I was drawn to this movie by the fact that it had Benedict Cumberbatch and I was not disappointed. The movie is based on true historical events and for most of us who were not there in the 1960s, it is eye opening to see how close we came to a nuclear disaster.About the movie, it starts off quiet slowly setting the context and the background. While the first half is seemingly boring, you can feel that it'll be quite different in the second half. And it does. If you're looking for gotcha moments then there are not many. It won't have you by the edge of your seats. But if you're looking for depth of character and performance, there are plenty - Cumberbatch and Merab.I admitted that this movie caught my attention only because of Cumberbatch and he once again delivers an Oscar worthy performance. Inarguably he is one of the finest actors of this era and he used this movie to display his command on his trade craft. Playing the role of an ordinary business salesman, he adapts the flabby look of an ordinary Englishman in the 60s with ease. However, the transformation in the second half of the movie is breath taking and awe inspiring. His performance alone makes this movie a must watch.Honestly, I did not know Merab Ninidze until this movie and now I'm keen to see his other movies. His performance is powerful albeit understated in line with the character he plays in the movie. The movie revolves mostly around these two characters and the two fine actors do not disappoint. The characters show that despite differences in culture etc, one can not underestimate the power of human bonds. For me that was the key take away.",The Courier
