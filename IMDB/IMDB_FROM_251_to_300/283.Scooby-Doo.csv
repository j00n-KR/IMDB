0,TheLittleSongbird,"A little silly at times, but a colourful and amusing film.",7,25 May 2009,"This film is nowhere near as bad as the rating suggests, sure it isn't flawless, but a good film doesn't need to be that to be enjoyable. I thought Scooby Doo a colourful film, with some good direction, and very good performances from all involved. The best of the cast were Matthew Lilliard as Shaggy and Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, and Rowan Atkinson is amusing as Mondavarious. The film is very amusing at times, especially the scene when Scooby dresses as a Grandma and the scenes in the haunted house. The actress of Mary-Jane is very sweet too. But I will say that the film isn't without its flaws. The plot is a little far-fetched, and some of the farting jokes are very silly. There have been complaints of the Scooby Doo model being charmless, but I disagree. He was quite sweet at times. The only character I didn't really like that much was Scrappy, then again I never did like him, not even in the animated series. Despite these flaws, this film is not bad at all, and I will award a 7/10. Bethany Cox",Scooby-Doo
1,SnoopyStyle,For young kids and the properly baked,5,15 June 2014,"As always, Shaggy Rogers (Matthew Lillard) and Scooby-Doo bumble their way to catch the Luna Ghost. However constant fighting among the Mystery Incorporated group cause them to split up. They had kicked Scrappy Doo to the side of the road for being a douche. Two years later, each member is brought to the popular horror resort Spooky Island. Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), and Velma Dinkley (Linda Cardellini) are not happy at the reunion. The gang meets the owner Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) who thinks that visitors are being cursed. Shaggy falls the lovely Mary Jane (Isla Fisher). Velma meets N'Goo Tuana and Zarkos who explains that demons once ruled the island. Voodoo Maestro (Miguel A. Núñez Jr.) directs Daphne to the abandoned castle and the group all ends up there. Daphne finds a small pyramid relic Daemon Ritus. Velma and Fred find strange videos. The gang returns to the hotel and they are attacked by the island demons who kidnap many including Fred, Velma and Mondavarious. The next morning, everybody is back but they are all possessed by demons.It's a live action movie using a cartoon style of bright colors, silly action, childish humor, and ridiculous story. It's hard to say that this is a failure. It achieves exactly what they are after. I'm just not sure that it's particularly funny. I also don't know about including Scrappy Doo or giving him a douche personality. There are a lot of questionable things in this movie but there is enough wacky craziness to keep the 10 year olds entertained.",Scooby-Doo
2,jboothmillard,Scooby-Doo,3,19 April 2006,"The only good things about this film are the amount of good actors, who waste their time hardly doing anything, the scene with Shaggy (Scream's Matthew Lillard) and Scooby-Doo (Neil Fanning) burping and farting, and that's probably it, from director Raja Gosnell (Home Alone 3, Big Momma's House). The rest of the film is just a repeat of the cartoon's capers with okay effects and a very boring story. Starring I Know What You Did Last Summer's Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred Jones and Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne Blake, Linda Cardellini as Velma Dinkley, Rowan Atkinson as Emile Mondavarious, Spooky Island Owner, Isla Fisher as Mary Jane, Pamela Anderson and Scott Innes as Scrappy-Doo. I always hoped Scrappy wouldn't be in this film, but it's pretty interesting making him the villain, although they could have killed him. Scooby-Doo was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows, and he was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Adequate.",Scooby-Doo
3,ma-cortes,Live action update of Hanna-Barbara's early 70s animated TV series with lots of entertainment and amusement,5,20 August 2011,"The film concerns about our friends who form ¨the Mystery Inc¨ group . After an acrimonious break up, the Mystery Inc. gang are individually brought to an island resort to resolve strange goings on . After two years separated, Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby are mysteriously united together to investigate an issue on Spooky Island. As Scooby Doo ,Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) along with the remaining group (Sara Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prince Jr , Linda Cardellini) are back to solve a case that takes place at an eerie island where occurs weird events including some monsters with nefarious purposes . A theme park affects young visitors in very strange ways . But it seems to be they are brought back as one for more than just solving a magical mystery . Meanwhile Shaggy falls in love with a tourist (Isla Fisher). The equipment members are going out to investigate towards the amusement park, whose owner is a suspect man named named Mondavarious(Rowan Atkinson) . He needs their help, figuring out why the vacationers are leaving mellow and sober . The Mystery Inc soon realize that they cannot resolve this enigma without help from each other .In this entertaining picture there are comedy , tongue-in-cheek , slapstick, humorous moments, mild diversion and is pretty amusing. All are given an adolescent treatment which means no gore and no bad language just some old-fashioned likable scares , being funny watching humans meld into the CG characters . However , it contains bad taste when takes place a contest about fart jokes between Shaggy and Scooby. Of course , coward Scooby steals the spectacle as food-obsessed canine anti-hero with its grimace , faces and gesture .Many gags are good however the tale sometimes drags. Special mention to gags between Shagg and Scooby,they make a sympathetic comic couple . Movie combines live action with breezy computer generator animation on Scooby Doo creation , special effects are well done . The motion picture is regularly directed by Raja Gosnell who also filmed the follow-up . Kiddies may find the corny, flat humor and bemusing situations , but most adults will be disappointed , exception for the fans the classic cartoon series created by Hanna Barbera. Rating : average but entertaining and clearly aimed at the junior audience . Protagonists' antics might provide the silly smiles , but this cartoonist physical comedy is mostly ineffective . It's followed by a second part in similar style , cast and realization , titled ¨Scooby Doo unleashed¨ with lots of fun and as amused as the first , and will be best appreciated by preteen enthusiasts of the cartoon movies .",Scooby-Doo
4,BA_Harrison,A successful transition to the big screen.,8,25 March 2006,"I'm not ashamed to admit it  I'm in my late 30s and I love this movie!Scooby and the Mystery Inc. gang travel to Spooky Island after being invited to investigate a series of paranormal incidents. But is the owner of the island resort involved and will the gang discover the secret behind the strange occurrences? Kudos to all of the cast, who manage to bring the 2D characters to life perfectly. Freddie Prinze Jr. convinces as Fred, the pretty-boy leader of the group. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne is something special  all push up bras, lip gloss, short short dresses and PVC boots. Linda Cardellini is the Velma you always suspected lurked beneath that roll neck sweater  a pillow chested nerd, brainy AND sexy. Matthew Lillard is perfect as the slacker Shaggy (probably the best of the lot with his spot-on voice and remarkable resemblance to his animated counterpart). Scooby, of course, is CGI - not the greatest CGI, but that doesn't matter because the character is so much fun.In addition, there is a great performance from a creepy Rowan Atkinson and a sexy turn from gorgeous Isla Fisher as Shaggy's girlfriend.The movie is funny, silly and scary (possibly a little bit TOO scary for some kids) and director Raja Gosnell handles proceedings well. At points the plot may become a tad confusing for youngsters, but this is a minor niggle. The set designs, costumes, effects and props are uniformly impressive - from the day-glo Spooky Island attractions to the demon creatures, everything looks great.Kick back and enjoy this for what it is  a highly amusing, fun filled roller-coaster ride.",Scooby-Doo
5,paul_haakonsen,"It had the spirit, but lacked conviction...",4,28 December 2015,"The Mystery Inc. gang should have remained in the drawn and animated world, because this live action event did not turn out all that great. Why? Well, because the CGI was just horrible and did the movie or the Scooby Doo franchise no justice at all.While the storyline was right at home in the typical and beloved Scooby Doo universe, the live action thing was a difficult pill to swallow. And I believe that the movie would have fared better with an entirely unknown cast list. It is really difficult to look at the actors and actresses who were in the movie with a proper light after having witnessed this abysmal movie.That being said, it should also be said that that above ramblings is given from an adult's point of view. If you are a child, then this movie will be entertaining, especially if you love the Scooby Doo cartoons.And this movie is of course aimed for a young audience. I sat down to watch it as I grew up with the Hanna-Barbera cartoons on TV. So I wanted to see just how the transition from drawn animation to live action turned out.""Scooby Doo"" as a live action movie is somewhat of an acquired taste. Personally, I plan to keep my memories of Scooby Doo to the Saturday morning cartoons.",Scooby-Doo
6,Quinoa1984,"It tries, but in the ends, falls flat",5,16 June 2002,"I expected (from being a Scooby cartoon fan for some years) to think this movie not only as the worst movie of the year, but the worst movie of the decade so far.  And at times I wanted to feel that way, but I realize that the film did at least try to do what it could in the live-action from cartoon movie genre.  There are even some convincing moments (so to speak) and funny ones from Lillard and the computerized Scooby, but like the vein that this film came from- The Flintstones 1 and 2, Josie and the Pussycats, the cartoon versions are much appreciated over real (an exception in the Ninja Turtles movie, but that's another company).  Kids will like it, I suppose, but they will vary too; it's somewhat surprising that for a PG movie they dig in some weed jokes and that kids will most likely be oblivious to them unless they've gone through the DARE program: Shaggy's love interest is Mary Jane, there's one shot where the mystery van is shown to have smoke coming out the top (inside Shag and Scoob are cooking eggplant), Led Zeppelin shirt, more junk food than could meet the eye.  I don't mind, personally, although I personally would also not see this movie again.  C+",Scooby-Doo
7,studioAT,Meddling kids on the big screen,5,12 June 2012,The classic kids cartoon gets brought to the big screen in this attempt to create both a faithful adaptation of all that was loved about the original while also making a film for new fans. The casting is by and large good. Matthew Lillard may be the perfect Shaggy while Linda Cardellini certainly looks and sounds the part as Velma. I wasn't a big fan of the high kicking action hero Daphne but the relationship everyone is interested in is Shaggy and Scooby and they are at the centre of the action.It's a big and colourful film for all the family with all the pop culture references and catchphrases that we loved about the original series.Both the live action Scooby films have different charms but this is certainly a good attempt to bring the format back to life.,Scooby-Doo

9,Theo Robertson,Affectinate Enough Tribute To Classic Cartoon,6,28 February 2005,"The one thing I always hated about the fondly remembered cartoon series of SCOOBY DOO is when the Mystery Inc team capture the monster and it's revealed that it's a man dressed up . This film version opens with a similar scene of a "" Ghost "" having his masked pulled off only to reveal it's a man screaming "" If it wasn't for those pesky kids I would have got away with it "" so thankfully we're not going to be watching a feature film whose only connection with its source material is the title , something like WILD WILD WEST , STARSKY AND HUTCH and THE CHARLIES ANGELS movies all suffer from this As for the cast Freddie Prinze Jr and Matthew Lillard make fairly good jobs in their respective roles as Fred and Shaggy , though Sarah Michelle Geller is slightly to hard faced to be truly convincing as Daphene , possibly the sexiest cartoon character in history . Talking of sexy the major casting disappointment is Linda Cardellini as Velma . I'm sorry but Velma is a short , fat , plain girl with glasses , the sort of girl who ends up a spinster because no man with eyesight would fancy her while Ms Cardellini is far too hot to be playing these type of roles . as for the eponymous Scooby it's noticeable that Casey Kasem isn't doing the voice but that doesn't matter too much while people who complain that Scooby looks too much like a cartoon character seem to be missing the point . Duh he's a cartoon character what'd you expect ? Nice to see Rowan Atkinson appearing too , surely the funniest comedy actor for many a year There might be some problems with the story but this is forgivable since we're talking about a twenty minute cartoon format stretched out into a ninety minute movie but this is an affectionate tribute and the story could have easily come from the classic cartoon series . It didn't win any Oscars but no one expected it to and as pop corn entertainment it works well enough",Scooby-Doo
10,preppy-3,Good? No. Funny? You bet!,8,26 June 2002,"Scooby and the gang investigate a mystery on Spooky Island.OK...this is NOT a good movie.  The jokes are very obvious and the PG rating keeps things very clean and family friendly.  Still, I was laughing a lot. Maybe it was my mood, but I kept giggling over all the jokes.  It works mostly because the entire cast plays it straight.Sarah Michelle Gellar looks nothing like Daphne in the cartoon, but she is good. Likewise, Freddie Prinze Jr. looks nothing like Fred either, but he's OK.  Matthew Lillard, however, is letter perfect as Shaggy.  Also the woman playing Velma is right on target.  And the CGI Scooby was just great...his expressions and body language provided lots of laughs.  Great special effect and the movie moves quickly.My only real complaint--did we really need a burping/breaking wind contest between Scooby and Shaggy?A very good family movie--I liked it a lot. A very guilty favorite all the way.",Scooby-Doo
11,Boba_Fett1138,"Annoying, noisy, wrongly paced movie.",4,14 October 2005,"This truly was an annoying, unfunny movie to watch. OK I admit I never have been a big fan of the 'Scooby-Doo' cartoons but I at least expected this movie to be entertaining.In the beginning the movie perfectly made fun of all the early old 'Scooby-Doo' cartoons. Every episode was always the same and every character always basically did the same in every episode and the beginning of the movie perfectly makes fun of this. As the movie progresses the movie becomes more and more unoriginal and unfunny and gets a totally wrong way too fast pace.The pace is really the thing I had the most problem with during the movie. It was way too fast and the viewer isn't getting a moment rest. On top of that there isn't really anything good or funny happening on screen. The story is way too weak and simple and the use of music songs in the movie is annoying and makes this movie an annoying, busy, noisy mess.The Scooby-Doo character in my opinion doesn't have enough screen time to regard him as the main character. On top of that he isn't very impressive looking. CGI-characters were even in 2002 at a point of looking realistic but Scooby-Doo is way too fake looking along with all the CGI-monsters in the movie.Sarah Michelle Gellar really is an annoying, weak actress. She really acts like an amateur in this movie. Matthew Lillard is a way better actor and he seemed like the only actor in the movie that could interact correctly and believable with the Scooby-Doo character. Also Rowan Atkinson is of course a talented comical actor and Linda Cardellini is perfectly cast as dorky Velma.An annoying, noisy, wrongly paced movie. Still kids will perhaps still find some joy in this movie.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Scooby-Doo
12,Calicodreamin,Good scooby-doo fun,7,30 March 2020,"Is this an Oscar worthy movie? No. But it's all in good fun, a proper scooby-doo mystery with a few good laughs.

13,neil-476,A surprising success,8,6 May 2012,"For the benefit of anyone who doesn't know, Scooby Doo is an apparently endless series of cartoon episodes and movies featuring four young people and their giant almost-human dog who investigate apparent supernatural goings-on which mostly turned out to be due to a crook creating elaborate tricks.Let's be honest, the cartoon series - tremendously popular for many years - are utterly formulaic, poorly animated, and fairly witless and uninspiringly written.An odd item to choose for translation to live action (albeit with a CGI Scooby), and foredoomed to failure, one would think.Do you know, it's rather good. It starts with a short sequence which exactly replicates the TV series, which shows that it knows exactly what it's doing, then it goes off on an original story which takes a slightly - but not totally - different angle.The story is fine, the cast are excellent - they capture the essence of their TV forebears and then breathe life into them - and the effects are good (albeit noticeably on the cartoony side).This is a good family film.",Scooby-Doo
14,FlashCallahan,Let's get Jinky with it.....,5,12 January 2013,"After two years apart, Mystery, Inc. are back together and ready to solve the mystery of Spooky Island. Spooky Island is a resort run by Mr. Emile Mondavarious, who is having troubles with what he believes are real spooks. This is bad for business, when it gets around and threatens to send the guests scattering back to the mainland. Mondavarious convinces the gang that they are needed and should work together. But is the island really haunted, or is there just a sinister individual behind all the ride malfunctions and creepy, crawly creatures? If so, who could it be?......It was inevitable that this would happen eventually and it was inevitable that it wasn't going to be very good.For starters, Scooby is an awful CGI creation and annoys one whenever he is on screen, which doesn't bode well when it's the titular character.The cast are not very good either. We have a below average Vampire Slayer, and a man who was in a couple of Teen movies,a nd not much else.The biggest draw here is Lillard, and to be fair, he does a good Shaggy, but he's always on the screen with CGI dog, so it always draws you away from him.Story is non-existent, and narrative is as bad as the cartoon, and it's just an excuse for bad special effects and some really cringe inducing innuendo.Yes, we know Shaggy is a stoner, and Velma is really hot, and the whole thing is a pseudonym for teens being teens on spring break and 'losing' things, but we didn't need it throwing in our faces.So all in all, it's bad, but then it was expected, so it turns out to be strangely watchable.",Scooby-Doo
15,Aaron1375,This mystery provides some light entertainment.,6,25 June 2002,"I saw this film when it came to theaters and have to say while it by no means is a work of art, I found it rather amusing in sections. It kept me entertained as do a lot of mindless popcorn summer flicks which this was one. The mystery gang clears up a mystery right at the beginning of the film, but end up breaking up essentially and going their own way. Well they are reunited on an island where they have another mystery to solve and it is of course rather wacky. The cast is good, they do in fact remind me of live action versions of the cartoon characters. However, Scooby is computer generated and looks a bit off. Granted this movie is a bit older now, but even back then I think they could have done a better job with the way he looked. I do not think a real dog would have done the trick though as they to often look off too when made to look as if they are talking. An interesting villain of choice in this one as it may not come as a total shock, it was still a funny surprise. There would be a sequel to this film that would not be nearly as successful which is not surprising in that this one may have performed well at the box office, but is generally hated by critics and a lot of the audiences too. Still, while it was no work of art as I have said, I still enjoyed it for what it was.",Scooby-Doo
16,Wuchakk,Better the second time around,5,24 October 2011,"Being a fan of the original cartoon I went to see this live-action version of ""Scooby-Doo"" in the theater in June, 2002 (Was it that long ago?). After the first 15 minutes or so I slowly became more and more disappointed. But after seeing it again last night, I must say it's better on repeat viewings.What most impressed me on my first viewing was Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma. Freddy Prinze Jr. as Fred was acceptable while Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne wasn't quite right for the role, although serviceable; I'm sure she got the role because of her popularity at the time. The addition of the winsome Isla Fisher as Mary Jane is a peripheral highlight. The CGI Scooby was good for the time (2002) and holds up pretty well.What disappointed me on my initial viewing? I was hoping for a straight live-action adaption of the cartoon sorta like 1994's ""The Flinstones."" What I got instead was part homage and part parody. This would have worked for me but the film bogged down in the ""Spooky Island"" segment, which comprises the 2nd and 3rd acts, which amounts to a full hour of the film. What's wrong with this large chunk of the movie? The whole ""Spooky Island"" set was just too cartooney for a live-action homage. It's hard to explain, but it just turned me off. In hindsight, I suppose the cartooniness was intended since the film's based on a cartoon (aduh).Viewing it a second time, I had the same impressions of the film up to the 30-minute mark, but the final hour won me over. How so? I still don't like the limitations of the ""Spooky Island"" set but I was impressed with the whole 'well of souls' aspect and the complications thereof, as well as the ingenious way they included Scrappy-Doo in the plot. I used to think I was the only one who literally couldn't stand Scrappy-Doo, but now I see that my feelings were pretty much universal. What's wrong with Scrappy-Doo? Scrappy rightly become the symbol of an annoyingly overexuberant or cute character added to a series in an attempt to maintain ratings, also known as the Cousin Oliver Syndrome (named after the character from the final season of the ""Brady Bunch,"" of course).The film runs 86 minutes, which is perfect for cartooney fare like this, and was shot in Queensland, Australia.FINAL WORD: This live-action version of ""Scooby-Doo"" is definitely better on repeat viewings. If you loathed it on your initial viewing be sure to give it another chance. Aside from obvious positives like Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini nailing Shaggy and Velma, the film features cutie Isla Fisher in a significant role, plus the creative plot elements of the 'well of souls' and Scrappy-Doo.GRADE: C+ or B- (5.5/10 Stars)",Scooby-Doo
17,mm-39,Boy did they make Fred into a dummy,6,16 June 2002,"A bit PCish, and that kind of destorts the show from when I was Kid.  Despite that the character were close to cartoon,  except fred. A good movie for the kids, and entertaining in general.  Watchable, and interesting, but I feel a little bad for whay they did to Scrapy Doo.  This film kind of tarnish a few childhood memories, but still a good film. 6/10",Scooby-Doo
18,JamesHitchcock,Is there a gap in the unborn foetus market?,1,17 October 2013,"The original ""Scooby-Doo"" television cartoon series was part of my childhood in the seventies, but I cannot say that it was a part I remember with any great affection. For those too young to remember it, it revolved around the doings of four young people (of college student age) who collectively called themselves ""Mystery Inc"" and roamed across America in a flower-power camper van, solving mysteries along the way. The four were Freddie (handsome upper-class WASP boy), Daphne (pretty upper-class WASP girl), Velma (plain, nerdish, bespectacled intellectual) and Shaggy (spaced-out hippie). They were always accompanied by the title character, Shaggy's large and cowardly dog. (Scooby is officially a Great Dane, but I doubt if he meets the official Kennel Club standard for this particular breed). The main reason why I disliked the seventies cartoon was that I considered it childish. Yes, I know I was only a child myself at the time, but children can be pretty unforgiving of books, films and television programmes they regard as having been aimed at children of a lower age group (or lower IQ group) than themselves. My main problem was that every episode was essentially the same. The mystery would always involve a supposed ghost, monster, or other supernatural creature terrorising the local population. Mystery Inc would begin to investigate and after a plot consisting of much screaming and running away from the creature (and possibly also of Daphne being captured and having to be rescued) the gang would invariably realise that the supposed ""ghost"" (or monster, or other supernatural creature) was in reality a flesh-and- blood human being who had assumed this elaborate disguise as part of some dishonest scheme. The episode would end with the villain being unmasked and arrested, normally exclaiming ""... and I would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids!"", or some minor variation thereon. Old television cartoons are generally best left to die-hard nostalgia freaks, but Hollywood frequently ignores this piece of received wisdom (as, for example, with the movie versions of ""The Flintstones"" and ""Josie and the Pussycats""), and someone evidently thought that ""Scooby- Doo"" was a prime candidate for a live-action film series. In the opening scene Mystery Inc are seen ridding a toy factory (owned, rather improbably, by Pamela Anderson) of a ghost which, of course, turns out to be a man dressed up as a ghost. After an argument the group split up, but are reunited when all receive invitations to a theme park named Spooky Island, where the owner, Emile Mondavarious, believes that his guests are falling victim to a mysterious curse and asks the gang to investigate. Which leads to a plot consisting of much screaming and running away from various monsters (and also of Fred and Velma being captured and having to be rescued). Well, actually it gets a lot more complicated than that, but if you want to explore these complications and discover the eventual solution to the mystery you will have to watch the film itself. I just hope it makes more sense to you than it did to me. The original plan was for a knowing, self-mocking postmodernist take on the original, packed with adult humour, and a lesbian affair between Daphne and Velma, but the producers eventually decided on something more family-friendly. Some traces of the original plan survive; Shaggy's pretty blonde girlfriend is named ""Mary Jane"", apparently a drug reference (deriving from the mistaken belief that the word ""marijuana"" is a shortened form of ""Maria Juana""). Freddie's nickname for Shaggy, ""the Shagster"", might seem to be another piece of adult humour, but is more probably due to the scriptwriter's ignorance of British slang. (The word ""shagster"" does not exist in the dictionary, even in Britain, but over here would be taken to imply someone with a high sex drive). We cannot, of course, be sure how ""Scooby-Doo"" might have turned out had the producers stuck to their original intentions, but the result could not possibly have been worse than the film we actually have. The plot is witless, standards of acting are uniformly low and the CGI used to create the monsters and Scooby-Doo himself is ludicrously unconvincing. Even the look of the film, with its hard, bright primary colours, is unattractive. Although the film is supposed to be a comedy, there is very little humour worthy of the name, and attempts to generate laughter, including a farting joke and a urinating joke, generally fall flat. (You have to be Mel Brooks to make cinematic farting funny). Most of the time we are laughing at the film, not with it. Presumably a CGI Scooby-Doo was needed because no real dog would lower himself to appear in this trash, but human actors were obviously not so fussy, and none of them emerges with any credit. Rowan Atkinson on top form can be one of Britain's funniest comedians, so God only knows what he is doing here. Linda Cardellini struggles hard to look plain and dowdy as Velma when she is quite obviously neither of those things. The worst actor on display is probably Freddie Prinze, Jr. (acting alongside his real-life wife Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne) who makes Freddie into an obnoxious jerk. The cartoon character was always blond, so Prinze has to be forced into a blond wig as unconvincing as anything else in the film. I said that I found the original cartoon series childish, but compared to this film it looks like the last word in adult sophistication. I am not sure what demographic the film is actually aimed at (apart from those who think that ""your mom eats cat poop!"" counts as sparklingly witty repartee). Certainly not adults. Certainly not most children. Toddlers? Infants? Babes in arms? Is there an unexploited gap in the unborn foetus market? 1/10 (Only the fourth occasion on which I have given the minimum mark).",Scooby-Doo
19,StevePulaski,"When in doubt, head for the hills",6,3 August 2011,"I may seem cynical, but I know a bad film when I see one and Scooby-Doo most certainly is dis-pleasant, insulting, and horrifically bad. It's so bad, I can't believe Warner Brothers wanted to pursue the idea of a live action film, with the main character being the only point of animation - who is made into an awkward CGI character. In a good film like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, that wasn't directly made for kids, still carried on like a normal film without going over the top. This is a test of a child's supply of catoonish antics, and a parent's test of sanity.The saddest thing about Scooby-Doo is it pretty much paved the way for films based on an animated Television series to be made into full length films with the main character(s) in CGI. Later there would be Garfield, The Smurfs, and Yogi Bear just to name a few. I can't say that I've liked any of those films because they are simply awkward to look at. Something about a clearly animated animal functioning in modern society doesn't look or feel right. It's strange, and extremely out of place. It makes The Country Bears look fitting, and while that was a pathetic film, I can at least give it more credit for trying to use costumed bears rather than relying on an embarrassing and lazy technique.My main question is for the director and crew of this film; who was the target audience for this film? Was it fans of the original series, likely in their middle ages by now? Was it now younger fans who did or didn't watch the series today? Either way, it disappoints for anybody, except a child between the ages of three and six (pushing seven or eight) who are amused by poorly animated animals in the real world, loud sequences just to showcase the film's no-limits style, and dopey characters that hardly pass as detectives.Another thing I've began to question about Scooby-Doo is how much of it is true entertainment? Think about it, 20% of the show is logic detective work, 30% of the time the dog is a one man show, and the remaining half is the gang running scared. What kind of detective is that? I hope one day we get a lost episode of Columbo where Peter Falk runs scared from a crime scene. Sure, I'm comparing and contrasting two classics, one meant for adults and one meant for children, but what it boils down to is that Scooby-Doo was a shell of what it could've been.The one scene I remember loving as a kid was the intro at the factory where the Luna Ghost captures Daphne. I was entertained by it back then, and still was mildly amused when I watched it. Still, one good scene followed by eighty-one more minutes of nonsense isn't a good film in my book. I normally say right here where the film could've been good, but I don't know if there was a correct way to adapt such an odd idea to film properly without going over the top. When in doubt, leave it animated.Starring: Matthew Lillard, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini, Rowan Atkinson, Miguel A. Núñez, Jr., Isla Fisher, and with the voice of Neil Fanning. Directed by: Raja Gosnell.",Scooby-Doo

22,OllieSuave-007,Favorite cartoon character in a live adapted version!,7,21 March 2014,"Scooby-Doo is my favorite cartoon show of all time, bringing back sweet childhood memories when this show would air during the early mornings, after school, or on the weekends. Seeing Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma on a live adapted motion picture is a real treat.After the Mystery Inc. gang have gone their separate ways for two years, they each were invited to go to the whimsical resort Spooky Island, run by Mr. Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson). After they arrive, the discover that the resort affects young visitors in very strange and ghoulish ways, so it is up to Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby to realize they must reunite to solve the mystery.This is an adventurous movie from start to finish, with a predictable, but fun-filled story. Scooby is filmed in CGI, but voiced by Neil Fanning, and Freddy Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini each did a creative job in portraying Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy, and each matched the original cartoon voices very well, especially Lillard's Shaggy and Cardellini's Velma. Fred and Daphne are my favorite characters in the movie; Prinze and Gellar did great in their roles and it is just interesting seeing them go from portraying characters in teenage comedies, horror/slasher movies and Buffy the Vampire Slayer to a cartoon-based film.The special and visual effects were colorful and the island resort was a little too flashy, looking like it was ripped out of a comic book. A lot of slapstick comedy and humor gets a little too overboard or cliché, almost too childish at some point. Some movies are meant to be taken seriously and some are meant to just have fun with. Then, there are movies that are so bad and you end up not taking the movie seriously and not having fun with it. Fortunately, I didn't think Scooby-Doo was bad; it is a movie that is great for the entire family and just to enjoy. It is full of adventure and whimsical fun, but still having room to send a message of friendship and teamwork. So, sit back, suspend reality and enjoy one of the greatest cartoons come to life.Grade B",Scooby-Doo
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Get jinky with it.,5,2 January 2019,"Originally, 'Scooby-Doo (2002)' was set to be much more mature, commenting on the tropes of the television show that its now (young) adult audience had grown up with. While I don't think that James Gunn's (yes, that James Gunn's) original script should have been brought to the big screen in all its initially R-rated 'glory', it is a shame that so much of it is so heavily neutered, considering that its remnants of subversive satire are by far its most successful aspects. The final result, then, is a strange mix of the tongue-in-cheek, slightly cheeky and, sometimes, too 'edgy' for its own good and the supposedly kid-friendly, frankly infantile and altogether far less successful. This leads to some strange moments, such as a brief but noticeable sight-gag implying that Shaggy and Scooby are using the Mystery Machine as a 'smoke house' - which is a remnant of Shaggy literally being a stoner in the original screenplay - and a moment in which Fred, whilst in Daphne's body (due to a body-switching fiasco), makes a leery and cringe-worthy comment about being able to look at himself, as Daphne, naked while peering down his/ her top - which is a holdover, again, from the much more raunchy original screenplay. Still, not all is lost in translation. The characters are represented, generally, as the antithesis of what they were in the television show - or, at least, that's the intention. Fred, especially, is brought to life as a self-obsessed but ultimately somewhat incompetent 'leader' and his is probably the most successful characterisation. Daphne is represented as more of a capable, eventually 'kick-ass' character and, ultimately, is the one who 'saves the day', so to speak. While the casting of 'Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (1996 - 2003)' star Sarah Michelle Gellar is an inspired way of trying to bolster this interpretation, much of her bumbling persona comes across as counter-intuitive and, somewhat, misses the mark. Velma is represented as the sort of repressed, insecure 'brains behind it all' who's tired of not being given the spotlight, but her character ultimately feels very 'standard' in terms of subversion - even if she is portrayed well. Perhaps the least changed character is Shaggy (because the Studio rightfully 'chickened out' of putting a glassy-eyed drug-addict in a leading role of a children's film) but, ironically, he is the most entertaining thanks to the pitch-perfect casting of Mathew Lillard; he's an absolute treat and it's a joy every time he's on-screen, as he brings his cartoon character to life and acts opposite his CGI co-star with an energetic, unembarrassed vigour. Speaking of Scooby, he's actually quite entertaining but the effects used to render him are somewhat dated; plus, he's the source of most of the 'kiddy', yet strangely crass, humour in the flick. Still, you believe he's there thanks to the pretty excellent interaction with his fellow cast members. To be fair, the feature does do a good job of feeling like a live-action 'cartoon', thanks to its slapstick set-pieces and colourful set-design. Many of its most cartoony moments are actually quite enjoyable to watch, even if they sometimes cross the line into straight up silly territory. The picture as a whole is a decent experience, one that's intermittently entertaining but usually just average. It stumbles slightly whenever its two mission-statements tug against each other too hard, often feeling like a film of two minds that perhaps should have taken a steadier step in either direction. Still, I think I prefer a piece that tries something different to one that plays it completely safe; that's what makes one this quite charming. It's not great, though, even if it perhaps could have been. It's always a relatively good time, however, and there are even a few chuckles here and there. In the end, it really is Mathew Lillard that makes it. 5/10",Scooby-Doo
24,g-bodyl,Enjoyable!,7,11 November 2010,"Scooby-Doo is a pretty good movie but it's not the greatest in the world. I think they did a good job with the CGI Scooby but the acting is somewhat weak. I also loved Scrappy the evil dog. He is probably the best thing about the movie.This is based of the cartoon. Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby are invited to Spooky Island where they investigate a few disturbances that happen in the area.I mentioned before that the acting is a little weak. I thought Matthew Lillard as Shaggy was annoying but there was a funny farting scene between Shaggy and Scooby. The other actors were just okay.The special effects are not too bad. They made some believable monsters.Overall, this is a decent film. I had fun watching this but I liked the cartoons better. I rate this film 7/10.",Scooby-Doo
25,lesleyharris30,"Underrated ,a good live action version of one of my favourite animated series.",8,12 August 2010,"I would have to say that Scooby Doo the movie is a pretty good movie and its underrated.I find it to be a good live action version of one of my favourite animated series from childhood.However,I don't like how they make Scrappy Doo the villain because he was a character I liked and I don't see why he was so negatively received.Scooby Doo,Shaggy and the gang all decide to quit their mystery solving adventures,but reunite when they get invited to a place called Spooky Island,where a lot of weird and spooky things occur,which turns out to be one crazy adventure for the gang.-8/10",Scooby-Doo
26,CuriosityKilledShawn,Matthew Lillard IS Shaggy,7,6 March 2004,"I was seriously dreading this film. What was conceivably a very, very bad idea turned out to be a surprisingly good film with a fair amount of comedy. Originally a Mike Myers vehicle (thank God THAT didn't work out), but then recast with I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream actors, the realization of Scooby-Doo as a CGI character interacting with live action actually works. I'd say it was a one in a million chance but Raja Gosnell managed to pull it off.The most impressive transformation tho is not cartoon Scooby to CGI Scooby but Matthew Lillard's performance as Shaggy. No way would I have believed he could possibly take on the role of one of my most fave characters ever but he just seems to completely disappear and the spirit of Shaggy takes him over. He brings some real integrity to what is widely regarded as an artless family movie. Even Freddy Prinze Jr. seems to nail the voice and narcissism of Fred, and Sarah Michelle Gellar is quite good as Daphne. Though I was always more attracted to Velma as I really dig nerdy chicks. Linda Cardellini brings some true sex appeal to the role. I wish the never-seen lesbian kiss between her and Daphne never got cut out.Of course the plot is the usual baloney but there is constant action and invention to keep even the most impatient viewer stuck on till the end. The gang go to a theme park resort called Spooky Island (actually an Australian resort) to solve the mystery of why the wild spring break kids are turning into well-mannered nerds. But not only are there guys in masks but there are some REAL spooks too. I would have liked Rowan Atkinson to have a bigger role as Emile Mondavarious but considering the twist (which comes as an amusing surprise) at the end, the plot doesn't really have room for it. It's good to have him in there though instead of a cast full of 20-somethings. But 99% of the comic genius comes Matthew Lillard.The CGI has dated somewhat since its release. Scooby and the various demons don't look very photo-realistic anymore and it's a little bit distracting. I doubt the target audience will care.An unfairly trashed and fun movie.",Scooby-Doo
27,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,But it was fun although,6,27 August 2021,"Of course, when I was a kid, I watched the animation. I watched the movie for the first time with Turkish dubbing on the Kanal D. This id bad movie, but it was fun although.",Scooby-Doo
28,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,Hmm,6,27 August 2021,"I watched it with Turkish dubbing when I was a kid. I didn't like the cartoon. I liked this movie because I watched it during my school years, but it wasn't a good movie actually.",Scooby-Doo
29,callanvass,"I admit that it does have some semblance of entertainment at times, but as a huge Scooby fan? Letdown",5,10 February 2014,"Fred's ego is out of control and he fails to give Velma the credit she deserves. This leads to acrimonious breakup for Mystery Inc. Two years later, they all receive an invitation to Spooky Island. The gang is far from thrilled about working together again, but they are gonna have to co-exist to solve this mystery. I've actually seen this when it first came out in theaters. I was younger at that time and my tolerance level was much higher. I remember really liking it and I have no idea why. I won't deny that this movie is an OK time passer and somewhat cute at times, but it really infuriated me at the same time. I have no problem with wanting to put a different spin on things with a different kind of vision, but this was an insult to the Scooby Doo legacy. For starters, Fred was NEVER, EVER this arrogant. He was always confident and sure of himself, but egotism wasn't in his vocabulary. In this movie, they make Fred into an overbearing buffoon. Admiring himself in the mirror, in love with himself? Different is good, but that was too much. It resorts to lazy gags, such as fart and burping jokes, and juvenile slapstick.. Come on guys, how could you show so much contempt for Scooby fans? It's like they forgot why the gang was so lovable in the first place. They were always a cohesive unit that had no shortage of ingenuity. I didn't buy the ""split thing"" it felt phony. I'm sure I'll annoy people by comparing this to the television show, but I can't help it, I love Scooby, and to me? This isn't Scooby Doo. I was never a Scrappy Doo fan myself, but to make him a bad guy? Did they honestly think that would be clever? It was stupid. Freddie Prinze Jr. is awful as Freddy. He's a pretty bad actor in general, but he is especially bad in this one. He has no idea on how to portray Fred properly. Sarah Michelle Gellar is actually perfect as Daphne. She hits all the right notes and clearly researched her role. She portrayed Daphne perfectly in my books. Matthew Lillard is scary good as Shaggy. It didn't feel like I was watching an actor, he WAS Shaggy to me. I was so impressed by him. Linda Cardellini is pretty good as Velma. She had her off moments, but she comes through more often then not. Rowan Atkinson has fun in his role as the villain. Isla Fisher is simply romance fodder for Shaggy, simple as that. I'm not sure why they chose an animated dog....It looked rather cornyFinal Thoughts: All of my carps aside, if I wasn't such a big Scooby fan, I would have probably enjoyed it more. It isn't totally void of entertainment. It can be cute at times, but for me it wasn't enough. There are too many things wrong with this movie for me to give it a full recommendation, but others may have a different perspective on it. If the sequel is anything like this one, I'm not looking forward to it 5/10",Scooby-Doo
30,tabuno,Funny Children's Movie,8,27 January 2019,"16 June 2002. What eight years time can do. The dialogue and performances were not as entertaining nor as magical, in some places it was downright embarrassing and lame. While the basic storyline line and the predictable moral underpinning remained decent enough, the movie didn't really hold up well consistently. The sparkle just seemed to dull over time. Perhaps the nature of the animation industry has matured and grown up further or the audience requires more than just Saturday morning mind-numbing animated/live action adventure, or this reviewer has just grown or lost childlike innocence or Sarah Michelle Geller's Buffy persona has faded with time effectively allowing the more objective experience to wash over the screen. Regardless, animated movies, and live-action have progressed significantly in the past eight years. The bar is much higher. And this movie apparently hasn't held up well in the meantime.6/16/02 (8/10): As an adult without children, it may seem strange for me to make positive comments about this movie, but I enjoyed the mindless, fun entertainment. This movie is based on a cartoon and as such, its transformation onto the screen must be understood in that context. The characters and Scooby Doo appear as huge, live cartoon characters. The children in the theater audience as well as some of their parents seemed to enjoy the movie and some actually laughed. This movie really struck a cord with a early morning cartoon crowd which I believe is a great measure for success. I mean look at what the Sunday comics section is like. This movie version just glorifies the colorful, brilliance of live animation and what live actors can do when they try to imitate art, literally. Why can't critics judge this movie on the basis of what it really is? A cartoon of a million scenes. Thank goodness for live animators (I mean living and breathing actors and actresses).",Scooby-Doo

32,Movie Nuttball,Arguably the best Summer movie of 2002! Theatrecal and video comments below!,10,8 October 2002,"I was originally going to see The Bourne Idenity but it was sold out at MY local Wehrenberg theater that is a huge building, a deluxe facility if you will that has a bowling alley, a large arcade, a huge screen for special events such as Baseball, and other sports, and not to mention 20 giant screens that all has stadium seating and a lot more! Enough of this, anyway Scooby Doo was awesome! The cast was perfect and they just didn't look like the classic cartoon characters but they acted and sounded exactly like them! The contest between Scooby and Shaggy was one of the most well executed and funniest scenes I have seen in a movie quite along time. When this great scene came the whole theater was laughing and they couldn't stop and neither could I! This along with Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones and Spider Man is the films to see this summer and I can't wait for the sequel to come out and I hope that this will become a franchise because its that good! I just bought Scooby Doo The Movie on VHS and its a blast! Its just as good on video than in the theater! It has special features at the end which is a music video and deleted scenes and I just love the one featuring Velma singing! I really loved that one and I won't spoil the rest of the bonus scenes! I just love Scooby Doo and all of the actors did a wonderful job!I recommend all Scooby Doo fans to buy this film now!",Scooby-Doo
33,leplatypus,As good as a pack of Scooby snacks ! (DVD),10,11 December 2010,"Scooby was my favorite show when i was a child (along with ""Goldorak"") and I rediscovered it as an adult when i was working in Bruxelles and when i went to the Warner Park in Madrid. That's why i went to see this movie at screen at its release and that I have a good time watching it again on DVD.For me, this Scooby franchise is among the best adaptation ever because i find all the original ingredients: spooks, colors and laughs! And i don't forget the cast that is excellent with its chemistry. I also thank them for accepting those flashy suits and acting with seriousness such silly parts. The story is really written by a fan because he sticks to the basic plot and adds some original ideas that enrich the characters. The sets are top and Mr. Bean as guest-star is nice, although he should have done more.The deleted scenes and especially the opening credits should have included in the release because the movie is short (83 min) and those cuts are really funny! Maybe Scooby isn't the best CGI character ever done but the soul of Scooby is here and we pay attention to the action rather than the effects! Well, thanks to everyone because you made a Scooby fan really happy! Zoinks!",Scooby-Doo
34,lisafordeay,Well I maybe a 22 year old chick but I found it actually good but not so good.,6,27 October 2013,"Scooby Doo is based off the animated series of the same name and stars Buffy's Sarah Michelle Gellar(sporting a red-head look for the role of Daphne),Freddie Prinze Jr(who's married to Sarah Michelle Gellar and I find him really cute),Matthew Lillard(as Shaggy sporting a goofy voice)and Linda Cardinelli(as Velma) all of whom are in this movie.So what's the film version of the popular cartoon show about well its about the mystery gang who split up and 2 years later they team up together again to solve a case in Spooky Island that is owned by Rowan Atkinson's(YES MR BEAN is in this movie)charcther that has people being brainwashed by some spell. Could Rowan Atkinson be over this?? Well you'd be surprised by the time you get to the end.So after this set up you'd think its the best family movie ever well no,its packed with fart jokes,the cast is good,the story is a bit creepy for kids to watch and everything about it is kinda silly.Overall its not one of those movies you'd watch again and again. But since were reaching the Halloween spirit,its not bad to watch for Halloween.Im giving it a 6 out of 10 because I love Scooby Doo as a kid and heck I still love the animated version.",Scooby-Doo
35,GOWBTW,This was better off without Scrappy Doo,8,14 January 2003,"I'm a big fan of Scooby Doo and I'm glad they made the movie based on that cartoon. The old cartoons are a howl to me except when Hanna-Barbera added Scrappy-Doo into the fray. WHAT A JOKE! The first mistake was getting rid of Fred and the girls. All of them had their weakness: Freddy; having such a big ego, Daphne; prissy and accident-prone, Velma; always vulnerable without her glasses, Shaggy and Scooby; GHOSTS and FOOD!!!!! But is one of the good weakness of those cowardly two some. When they got rid of the important three, I didn't like the show too much even when they brought back Daphne it was still weak. When I saw the episode when all of them return to help out the team, the magic had faded thanks to Scrappy Doo. When they had ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"" it was a little better after they did ""The Flintstone Kids"". The pride of Scooby Doo was back in the time of the gangs' younger days. When I read that Warner Bros. was doing the live version of Scooby Doo, I was thrilled and could hardly wait. The choice of casts members for the movie was ""far out"" as Shaggy would say. The choice for Velma was great: Linda Cardellini, The Price is Right contestant in'97 , she was awesome. Matt Lillard does well as Norville ""Shaggy"" Rogers. Freddie Prinze,Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar rounding the top cast as Fred and Daphne was fine. And Scooby Doo being animated was a riot. So when I saw the movie for the first time, I just thought it was the corniest thing I ever saw. When they finally regrouped after their differences, I knew there has to be a catch. Since Scrappy Doo ruined the genere, the movie will be considered his punishment. I think two more with be helpful and the last one should best be a little more surprising. I don't care what critics say about this movie, I LIKED IT! SCOOBY DOOBY DOOOOOOOO!!!!",Scooby-Doo
36,generationofswine,An Honest Review,5,1 April 2017,"It isn't necessarily bad...But it tries too hard to be the cartoon. In fact it strives to be the cartoon and, honestly, the cartoon does Scooby better.People didn't pay money to watch a live-action movie that tried so hard to be cartoonie that it forgot Scooby had a fairly serious tone to play the comedy off of.Instead it is zany where it should be serious and because of that the jokes never really land.Like when I was a little kid, I watch Scooby Doo because it's fun and its funny. And it does it by balancing the creepy with the goofy.The movie version skimps too much on the creepy and still tries to rely on the humor that worked so well because of the blend.In the end you have humor that ONLY works when it is referencing the cartoons and otherwise fails when it is trying to mimic the cartoons.Stay away from it. Watch the cartoons, most of them land the jokes better.",Scooby-Doo
37,dee.reid,Driving around in a van and solving mysteries... ***1/2 stars (out of five),7,20 October 2002,"First off, I would like to begin this by saying I watched and somewhat enjoyed the cheesy 70's cartoon this film is based on.  ""Scooby-Doo"" itself is not a bad film, but not a great one either.  I personally do not think this film will appeal to anyone who never watched the cartoon.  That is why I think Roger Ebert had such a difficult time reviewing ""Scooby-Doo"".  That is also why I think people who hated the movie most likely never watched the cartoon.  I admit that I thought ""Scooby-Doo"" would not amount to much either, but if you sit down and actually watch it, fun will be had. 
I think that what people do not understand about ""Scooby-Doo"", is that it is intentionally campy.  Part of the fun of watching the cartoon was being able to accept the camp humor and cheesy plot lines.  The acting in the movie is terrible as well, but it was done that way because that is what most films and cartoons that were popular at that time were like.  What ""Scooby-Doo"" is trying to do is to recapture that 70's camp.  Speaking of the camp, the special effects in the movie are so laughably bad, that you can not help but praise them.  The films humor consists mostly of burping/farting jokes and other slapstick.  As I already mentioned, the acting isn't very good either.  In fact, most of the actors seem seriously miscast, with the exception of Matthew Lillard, who plays Shaggy.  Not only does he look the part, but he sounds and acts like him too.  The same goes to Linda Cardellini, who plays Velma.  Now I was born in 1985, which was nearly a decade after the cartoon was in its prime.  I can't say that when I was younger, that I fully understood everything about this cartoon.  I'm 17 now, and I have heard a lot about the cartoon that may change anyone's viewing of it, even my own.  The characters are a lot different in the movie than they were in the cartoon.  But I guess that was part of being able to successfully bring the characters to the big screen.  Fred is no longer the all-out jock he once was, Daphne seems a lot dumber and less of a snob, Velma actually displays emotions, but Shaggy and Scooby are just the same.To clear some things up, Shaggy and Scooby are potheads.  Why do you think they are so hungry all the time?  Also why do you think Shaggy said that he likes the name ""Mary Jane"" so much?  The report of one particular deleted scene with Velma getting drunk and singing a love song to Daphne should also give a hint to her sexual orientation.  Lastly, Fred and Daphne are dating. (This fact is helped along by the news that Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar are married in real life.)P.S.: You also won't want to miss the performance by Sugar Ray or miss the countless OutKast beats playing in the background either.",Scooby-Doo

The storyline follows the gang deciding to breakup after they don't feel they are equally getting credit for their crime fighting abilities. When things seem to be going astray they reluctantly get back together to try and solve one more major case. This movie is directed by Raja Gosnell (Big Mamas House) and stars Matthew Lillard (Scream), Freddie Prinze Jr. (She's all That), Linda Cardellini (Avengers), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) and Isla Fisher (Wedding Crashers). The casting for this is excellent and they are put in some fun and entertaining scenarios. The writing for Shaggy and Scooby is excellent but the entire cast portrays their characters well. I also enjoyed the soundtrack. The CGI was really good and the film is actually pretty solid until the very end, then the final villain and CGI gets out of control and the movie falls apart.

40,GiraffeDoor,It's Jinkies good. (Am I using that right?),8,28 April 2020,"It's easy to be dismissive of these big budget reboots of classic animated shows marketed to the latest generation.I watched this over and over as a kid and re-watching it recently as an adult it surprised my how much this held up as an affectionate pastiche of the show, neither trying too hard to imitate it nor failing to appreciate its base material for what it is.The characters aren't quite how they were in the ""-where are you"" era and that is part of the charm. One dimensional leader, Freddie is now a self absorbed jock, Daphne is struggling to move beyond her damsel in distress image and We get to see what later become the standard template for Velma that the show ""Mystery Incorporated"" would use: someone a lot more jaded and cynic and she truly steals the show (I happen to find it the most adorable thing ever when she says she wanted ""scare the putootie out of Daphne"".The jokes come fast and thick and are admirable in a low brow way (in one scene they become shockingly lavatorial but you can always skip it.The mystery at its core enriched by the plot element of the gang being reunited after an acrimonious break up, makes this movie feel worthy of theatrical release and gives it the emotional depth it needs.All the classic elements of the show are there and they make some admirable jokes at the show's expense I won't ruin, while still paying homage to all the things that made it iconic.The special effects have not aged well but that's a small thing.",Scooby-Doo
41,Fluke_Skywalker,Ruh-roh,4,25 March 2015,"No real effort is made to contemporize the characters, yet strangely this is never mined for laughs a la 'The Brady Bunch Movie'. Prinze and Gellar are okay as Fred and Daphne, and Cardellini is pretty good, but chunky turtlenecks and glasses aren't enough to hide the fact that she's waaaay too hot to play Velma. Waaaay too hot. But it's Matthew Lillard as Shaggy who steals the show. In looks, mannerisms and voice it's as if the cartoon came to life. Scooby is rendered somewhere in between cartoon and photo real, and though the effects haven't aged particularly well, it works here.Overall it's a colorful and breezy movie, but unfortunately the laughs are few and things drag when Shaggy and Scooby aren't on screen.",Scooby-Doo
42,davispittman,Pretty good family fun movie,7,8 March 2015,"I'm not gonna lie, saw this as a kid and loved it, and I still love it today! It's just a fun mystery/comedy/action movie. Now yes, I would've liked for them to tone down the potty humor a little, but really that's the only issue I had with it! Yah, personally, I think the whole fart contest scene just went too far, it got overboard. The cast was great, each and every one were cast exactly right, they all looked exactly like their character! This movie just makes me feel good when I watch it. Is it gonna win an Oscar, no, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining and fun to watch! Some of the CGI monsters could've been designed a little better, they don't look horrible or anything, but it's kinda evident that more effort could've gone into that, but I think Scooby Doo looked just fine. Sarah Michelle Gellar is by far the best here, I just loved her performance as daphne here, she was so spot on, and shaggy was so accurately depicted, it was scary lol. The action sequences are satisfying, especially the haunted castle scene on the island. I think that castle scene is very well done, and it's bound to please viewers, especially if you were a fan of the old animated series. Overall I'm giving Scooby Doo (2002) a 7/10 rating. It's not flawless, but u have to remember that this movie was targeted towards kids and families. But seriously I love watching this whenever I feel bad or just depressed about something, it always makes me feel better!",Scooby-Doo
43,Agent10,"Horrible, horrible, horrible",4,21 June 2002,"As a fan of the original cartoon, this film did the series very little justice. Maybe creating live action movies for cartoons is a bad idea. Look at what happened to Rocky and Bullwinkle? Truly, the last great movie to mix in animation with live action proved to be the most ground breaking; Who Framed Roger Rabbit? While I will say Fred, Shaggy and Daphne were well cast, Linda Cardellini looked too pretty to be Velma. Heck, take her out of the goofy sweater and she looks better than the skeletal Sarah Michelle Geller. This was just a mess of a film, with an annoying soundtrack to boot.",Scooby-Doo
44,questl-18592,Scooby 1,7,15 September 2020,"Haven't watched this in ages and I think it mostly still hold up. Obviously the CGI looks pretty awful here and some things, culture references and whatnot that haven't aged well. But, what worked them still works now. They captured the spirit of Scooby-Doo and managed to capture it live. The cast is great, each of them playing their roles wonderfully. I will say, Cardellini fits the personality of Velma but it would have been nice to see them cast someone more in line with Velma and not another super skinny, traditional beauty but that's such a tiny thing.All in all, I think this is still fun for fans of the gang. Should still be fun for kids too. Was a fun little treat and definitely recommend this over the more recent Scoob!",Scooby-Doo
45,rbverhoef,Don't waste your time,4,14 April 2004,"Of all the adaptations from television shows and video games lately 'Scooby-Doo' must be one of the least interesting. It has characters you will not feel anything for, a story that is as stupid as it can be, no real jokes and some bad visual effects, although Scooby himself looks good enough. I am not very familiar with the animated series but if it looks like this movie I would not like the series either.Some better things in this mess I would like to mention though. The dog (voice by Scott Innes) and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) gave me some smiles, the boss of the spooky theme park where the movie is set is played by Rowan Atkinson who gave me some smiles as well, and the movie is very colorful which, I think, is a good thing. Still, the story that even goes to taking over the world, other characters like Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Velma (Linda Cardellini) and Mary Jane (Isla Fisher), the sometimes terrible visuals and the complete lack of nice jokes make this a movie to forget as quickly as possible.",Scooby-Doo
46,masonsaul,Great fun,8,11 October 2020,"Whilst Scooby-Doo is probably not a good movie and not without it's flaws, mainly it's weak plot and subpar CG, it's still great fun with a unique charm. Matthew Lilllard, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini and Freddy Prinze Jr. are all surprisingly perfect as their iconic characters. It's consistently really funny and extremely well paced. Raja Gosnell's direction is good, it's well filmed and the soundtrack is really good.",Scooby-Doo
47,rosscinema,As bad as I expected,1,14 July 2002,"This movie is as horrible as ""Josie and the Pussycats"" but not as stomach turning as ""Dudley Do-Right"". Matthew Lillard is a natural choice as Shaggy and is perfectly cast. But everyone else looks confused and lost. A script is rarely as bad as this. The first scene in the movie has the spirit of the cartoon but everything after that is utter garbage that has nothing to do with the original concept of Scooby-Doo. The cartoon has villains that are disguised as monsters but here there real demons! This inept bunch should be in over there heads. The two worst scenes for me are where Scrappy-Doo urinates on Daphne and the second would be the belching and farting contest between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo. Not exactly like the cartoon! And this also has to be one of the worst surprise endings in movie history. Just plain dumb! I understand the filmmakers want to be a little contemporary, but you have to stick with what brought you here. And this end result is not the Scooby-Doo that we know!",Scooby-Doo
48,Rob_Taylor,Scooby-Don't,5,19 December 2002,"I was a big fan of the original cartoon series, so I was sceptical when they announced they were shooting a live action version. My fears, sadly, were justified.With the notable exception of Matthew Lillard (Shaggy), all the cast are just woefully wrong for the roles they play. Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr) is hopelessly inept, a far cry from the serious cartoon character. Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is nothing like the cartoon Daph I recall. Velma (Linda Cardellini) was not too bad, but all of them (except Lillard) struggled to emulate the original characters.Even the CGI Scooby is rather lame, and looked more like a cartoon than the original cartoon version did.There are some funny scenes. The farting in armour scene had me in hysterics, for instance. And the scene where they reminisce about ditching Scrappy-Doo, years before, really paid homage to the fans hatred of that particular character in the cartoon show. I kept expecting to see Scooby-Dumb (remember him?) show up, but thankfully they didn't go that far. Finally, the soul-swapping scene could have been managed better, and was just there for a quick laugh.But Shaggy (Lillard) was just so perfect that it made me cringe to see the rest of the cast, although the scenes with him and Scooby do work pretty well.If you're a fan of the cartoon show, watch it for Shaggy and Scooby, and try not to watch the fill-in bits with the rest of the cast.",Scooby-Doo

This is the first time Sarah Michelle Gellar looks miscast. The Buffy vibe producers pushed on her portrayal of Daphne, was the wrong way to go. Now I can see that. Linda Cardellini and Matthew Lillard were good. And Freddie Prinze Jr sort of justified his casting choice. Cameos and supporting roles were part of this time package, I guess. But making « creatures » look like cartoon characters, cheapened the quality of the movie. That now looks like it was made for TV, on a network's Holiday special. I'm not saying movies look better these days, but more efforts should have been made, regarding the aesthetics and how it would've been perceived years after its release.",Scooby-Doo
51,Terryfan,Scooby-Doo Where are you?,8,3 November 2015,"I would've gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids and your dog too! Scooby-Doo is still one of my favorite cartoons and when I first watch the live action movie on HBO it just had to seen to believe. Actually I was laughing through out the movie while it did have some moments that made me go what were they thinking? But still I actually entertain from this movie.The plot of the film is that the Mystery Gang Scobby-Doo, Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), and Velma (Linda Cardellini) are invited to a island theme park by Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) however things are not what they appear to be. Also we are introduce to Mary Jane (Isla Fisher) N'Goo Tuana (Steven Grives) and Voodoo Maestro (Miguel A.Nunez Jr) As the plot goes on I like how they added the theme song because come on everyone has heard ""Scooby-Doo where are you""? and know that theme by heart just having that theme more than once really does a good job. In fact a lot of the music in the film is enjoyable and the songs they feature in it have that special it factor.As for the acting, it is actually good Matthew's performance as Shaggy is just superb as he study the character very well He just shine as Shaggy, Sarah was very good as Daphne, Linda did well as Velma and Freddie did look the part of Freddie. But yeah the movie does feature some good acting just got to be more open mind about it. As for Scooby Doo I enjoy the C.G.I. Scooby Doo the cast did a great job with interacting with Scooby Doo to make it believable so props to themHowever what I didn't like about this film was the fact that it had moments that make you ""What were they thinking""? and it really should have been left out of the finish film but again who knows it could have been a lot of worse which is why I'm glad I got it on DVD so I can skip the parts that didn't serve any sense.But still as a fan of Scooby Doo I got to say this is actually a funny movie and it is quite entertaining plus well thought out comedy bits that gives that cartoon feel to the film so yeah give this movie a chance you might be surpriseI give Scooby-Doo a 8 out of 10",Scooby-Doo
52,MartianOctocretr5,Scooby & the gang search for mystery clues with mixed results,6,26 May 2006,"A sincere effort to have some fun with the old cartoon series, but the movie encounters some of the all-too-common problems of these cartoon-to-live-action remake movies. Making the leap from 2-D animation to 3-D reality is awkward at best, and proper casting can make the movie sink or swim. Also, it's difficult to point at just who your target audience is. Scooby Doo was a great cartoon. The writing was clever, the characters were lovable, the action continuous, the ""mysteries"" fun (and easy) to solve, and the comic-chase routine was predictable but fun in a ""3 Stooges"" type way. It's apparent that the writer, director, and the cast all had fond memories of the show as well, and had a party doing this movie.Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardinelli breathe life into Shaggy and Velma so well, you'd swear these characters returned from your childhood memories. Not only do they look like their animated counterparts, but they capture the nuances of those characters (right down to Shaggy's laugh and Velma's nasally voice) as well. Many actors have tried to bring cartoon characters to live action movies; few have accomplished it as well as Lillard and Cardinelli did here. The animation of Scooby is respectable: he looks slightly different, but enough the same that it works. The CGI movements are well done, and fit his ""personality.""However, Freddie Prinze and Sarah Michelle Gellar were miscast. Prinze just mugs for the camera, and Gellar looks more like she's doing a Buffy episode, complete with over-the-top fight scenes. Neither one looks or acts at all like their character (to their credit, both actors improved in the sequel).Also, the movie tries to fill in gaps of where the gang has been, which just bogs down the story. There are some scenes far more scary than the original series would ever delve into, such as disembodied spirits being imprisoned, mind control, zombies, etc. If the target demographic was small children, these elements were too strong. In other ways, too, it strays from the theme of the old cartoon series. On the positive side, the movie is cleverly written, although the plot is a little too complex for children to follow. There are good gags, some that kids would understand, and others for an older audience. Outside of the scary scenes, the movie has a lot of good natured silliness. The movie does not disappoint with the humorous mystery solution surprise (especially funny for fans of the original cartoon).If you can overlook the movie's weaknesses, it should still be a decent watch for some goofy and nostalgic fun. The sequel, however, is a little more consistent with the theme of the original cartoon.",Scooby-Doo
53,pyrocitor,Would you watch it for a Scooby-snack?,5,5 August 2015,"Scooby-Doo has always been an exercise in nostalgia, its cast of lovably iconic flower-power Sherlocks already feeling cheerily antiquated when airing in the 1960s. As such, it's oddly appropriate that the first live-action adaptation of the beloved Hanna-Barbera cartoon is so outrageously trendy that it functions as a brilliant time capsule for the early 2000s (a good litmus test of whether or not to see the film: whether the prospect of Scooby and Shaggy skateboarding to Simple Plan makes you guffaw or wretch). The show was a simple beast, content to lean on cheap sight-gags, shock-value spookiness, and repetitive, MacGuffin-y mysteries, but beloved due to its earnestness. Here, director Raja Gosnell (a solid contender for contemporary Hollywood's answer to Ed Wood) attempts to transpose and stretch the formula with all of the tact and cleverness of one of Shaggy's eggplant burgers. Yet, the fandom is strong with this one, and the Doo's debut is so cheerily, engagingly stupid, and propelled by its irresistible characters that, like the lovable mutt himself, it's hard not to take to, in spite of its wake of disastrous clumsiness. Like the show, watching for plot, theme, continuity or depth, is a laughably misguided exercise – our job here is to filter through the scatological, adolescent titters and clutch for the heart underneath. Granted, it can't help but feel cheap that the screenplay (by James Gunn, writer/director of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, recently trying his hardest to pretend this was another writer coincidentally sharing a name)'s central conflict caves to actually supernatural occultism instead of the show's stubborn insistence on debunking every fantastic occurrence with almost-plausible science. That said, there is a certain satisfaction in realizing that, no, you were not alone growing up thinking Scrappy-Doo was the most intolerable cartoon concoction imaginable, even if Gunn's 'big reveal' of him as surprise antagonist does subject the audience to a climax of an enormous, demoniacally bloated CGI Scrappy chasing the gang around. Cue Simple Plan again? Why not!Oddly enough, the CGI Scooby-Doo looks and moves somewhat convincingly without compromising the expressive flamboyance of the character's fundamental cartooniness (the prospect of a real dog being dubbed with 'romic rerief rines' is truly horrific). The rest of the CGI: not so much, as the film's creakily animated ghouls show the film's age worse than all of the Blink-182 doppelgängers. Thankfully, the rest of the film's visual aesthetic provides somewhat a fleeting saving grace – the set design boasts the same ornate kitch as the show, and the costumes, impeccably replicating the popping colours, turtlenecks, go-go boots and ascots of 'the Gang', are triumphant.If nothing else, Scooby-Doo is worthwhile for the performance of Matthew Lilard, so astoundingly perfect a live-action embodiment of Shaggy that it took over the rest of his career (like, he and J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson can battle it out for most eerily replicated cinematic cartoon character in the history of film. Zoinks!). It's no wonder, really: apart from nailing the look and voice of Shaggy, Lilard is a masterclass of effortless charm, sweetness, hyperbolic facial contortions and goofiness so endearing you will be surprised to find yourself laughing harder than you should at his fart-off with a CGI Scooby-Doo. Likewise, Linda Cardellini is the perfect Velma, indignantly intellectual and bubbly to a tee, even if her odd sexualization is a bit disturbing. Sarah Michelle Gellar's ferociously self-reliant Daphne is the smartest way to make the character not feel intolerably anti-feminist in the 21st century, and Gellar pours loopy charisma and martial arts skills alike into the character. Freddie Prinze Jr.'s Fred is more of a self-possessed bonehead than the cartoon's earnest but oblivious fearless leader, but he fits like a glove alongside fellow 90s relics Gellar and Lilard, and is tons of fun to boot. On top of the scene-stealing glee of a campy Rowan Atkinson having the time of his life as an evidently suspicious resort owner, keep your eyes peeled for an early Isla Fisher appearance, perfectly simpering as the woman of Shaggy's dreams, Mary-Jane (""Like, that's my favourite name!"" is a surprisingly hearty laugh). Ultimately, Scooby-Doo would have gotten away with it, if it wasn't for its doofus creative team opting for lazy pastiche instead of cleverly ironic remastering (I suppose a Mad Max- style zombie apocalypse Scooby-Doo action thriller is way out of the question). Thankfully, the fun factor is never compromised, and Gunn and Gosnell willingly swan dive into the inherent cheesiness, silliness, and broad spookiness of the cartoon with a tone that feels at least reminiscent of right. Dense and gaudy as it may be, it's ultimately harmless tackiness, liable to be a crowdpleaser for kids, and with just enough nostalgic nods and (surprisingly tasteful) winks at the more risqué elements of the swinging sixties relics to keep older viewers from existentially questioning their life choices. For those willing to slip on the rosy- tinted – and, hopefully, indulgent – goggles of a child, there is still amusement to be found in the antics of the Mystery Machine gang, vacant as they may be. Play it again, Simple Plan.Ree-hee-hee-hee-hee! -5/10",Scooby-Doo

56,film-critic,Ramburgers,5,19 July 2005,"This was not a great movie in any way, yet somehow there was something appealing to it which made it not the worst movie I have ever witnessed. You walk into this film with a level of expectancy. You want to see the same characters, stories, and clichéd moments that you did while watching the television show, and you do. The characters are creative, the story is very similar to the cartoon, and the clichéd moments are there in full force. Coming from a household that used to religiously watch this cartoon, I wanted this level of security, and I found it in this film. As a film watcher, I don't want to see the director of this film taking too many original risks and really destroying the culture of the cartoon. It stayed true to its roots, and for that you cannot fault this film. There were some humorous moments that made you think back to the cartoon, there were silly times where you just had to shrug and breathe in deeply, then there were some horrid moments that really just made you reach for the STOP button on your DVD player. Yet, I was expecting this. So, coming from an expectancy perspective, it was perfect. Coming from an entertainment value, it could have been a bit tighter.To begin, the actors. I agree that a remake like this may not have garnished the cream of the crop of Hollywood hitters, but I believe we could have done a bit better than Freddy Prinze, Jr. and Matthew Lillard. Sarah Michelle Gellar, I believe, could have been better as well. Here we have some ""C"" level players who are a huge hit with the teen audiences, bringing to life characters, which were created during an older generation's time. It just seemed a bit jumbled to me. Then, to make matters even more confusing, we had the famed Rowan Atkinson as the sneaky Spooky Island owner. Disappointing acting coupled with the great Mr. Bean doesn't quite fit for me. He should have been used so much more to his potential. He could have stolen this film from the others and made it into his own, but for some strange reason, bland acting breeds more bland acting, so you can't expect much.Outside of the acting, there isn't much else going on. Nearly everything that happens we have seen time and time again through the cartoons. Not much originality was brought into this film, while it felt like the money that should have gone to the creative department, was spent instead on sub-par CGI. Scooby looked horrible. I believe there was one instance where I could literally see right through him. Then, you have these un-storied creatures that look like Donnie Darko's rejects. Coupled with an annoying Scrappy-Doo. There was potential in the CGI, but it seemed as if they low-balled and went with cheap CGI to appease the smaller child audiences. The jokes needed to be planted deeper into the series. I remember watching The Brady Bunch movie and laughing because the jokes just seemed to play off the taboo of the series. I believe more focus on this with the Scooby-Doo movie would have raised this review another notch.Overall, I felt cheap after watching this film. It wasn't a horrible film (though there was quite a bit of poor graphics and acting) because it gave you what you wanted when you walked in. It gave you a mystery, the clichéd and overused structure of the original series, and that final moment when the true villain is revealed. It followed a structure that I wanted, and I am ""ok"" with that for this film. Normally, I would have asked for better, but there are some cartoons that do not need their internal structure tampered with. Scooby-Doo was worth the one viewing, but I cannot say that I will ever be pleased to see it again. The fact that there was the horrendous farting contest in the center of the film destroyed the entire experience for me. That was the kind of humor I was not prepared for, nor did I feel it best represented the series. The Mark McGrath cameo also did it in for me, but that my friend  well  is another story. If you have never seen this film I suggest it once, but I do not feel that it needs a second viewing. Scooby-Doo is alive, but in an animated version that continues to create laughter and creativity  unlike this shoddy film.Grade: *** out of *****",Scooby-Doo

58,IonicBreezeMachine,"It's flawed, but a charming cast and a snarky self aware tone make it fun.",6,13 October 2020,"A few years after the gang broke up as a result of tensions that have built up between them, the gang finds themselves reunited when reclusive theme park owner Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) enlists the gang's help to solve a mystery at horror themed Spooky Island. Once there, however the gang stumbles upon a mystery that may have world ending consequences.The film is an adaptation/parody of the Scooby-Doo franchise which despite originating in 1969 has managed to endure itself in the popular consciousness becoming arguably the most iconic Hanna-Barbera property (with Flintstones and Jetsons being contenders). The show has had numerous incarnations over the years and is still going strong. The Scooby-Doo movie straddles the line between being a straightforward adaptation meant for a family audience and a more cynical tongue-in-cheek parody like The Brady Bunch Movie or A Very Brady Sequel, and it's that identity crisis that brings the movie down and prevents it from fully standing on its own.Originally intended as a more outlandish spoof of the Scooby-Doo franchise and made with a tone similar to the 90s The Addams Family and Brady Bunch films, the film's tone and target demographic were subject to very late in the game changes by studio executives which mandated a PG rating(in contrast to the previously approved PG-13) as well as a more juvenile and kid friendly tone. Having seen some of the deleted footage, it's clear the end product was not the movie the filmmakers originally envisioned. The deleted footage has a lot more de constructive elements to the material as well as slightly cheeky and more over the top approaches to certain characters and situations. While the cut footage wouldn't have elevated the movie passed being okay, it would've helped to differentiate itself from other slapstick heavy family films of the time like Cats & Dogs or Snow Dogs. Even with all the clear editing that the film has been put through, the movie still does have some of its more innuendo focused gags (which admittedly are the funniest parts of the movie) and doesn't mesh particularly well with the kidified tone of the film.Despite clear signs of post production interference, the film still has merit. The Scooby gang are all perfectly cast with Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Linda Cardellini all giving good performances with great chemistry as Fred, Daphne and Velma, but easilly the best part is Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. Lillard embodies the character quite well and apparently watched every episode of the TV show he could get his hands on to prepare for the role, Lillard's commitment to the character down to him copying Shaggy's vegetarianism that became a pre-requisite for Casey Kasem to continue voicing the character is uncannily spot on and helps bring the character to life. The titular Scooby-Doo is well voiced by Neil Fanning (even if it doesn't quite capture the Don Messick delivery), but the actually effects used to create Scooby-Doo feel more like a rough outline for Scooby than a finished effect. Despite less than convincing effects, it's integrated reasonably well, but probably could've used more time for added polish.Scooby-Doo is a frustrating film because it's clear not just from the deleted footage but also the performances, costumes, and set designs that there's a clear passion and sense of fun as well as an understanding of the appeal and formula of the Scooby-Doo franchise. Unfortunately the movie compromises itself by trying to play itself as a kid's adventure movie while simultaneously being a knowing parody of itself and it doesn't quite stick either one. Despite that, there is a sense of fun to be had thanks to the cast's performance and chemistry and the knowing jibes that weren't left on the cutting room floor do still elicit some laughs thanks to their clear knowledge of the Scooby-Doo formula. A marginal recommendation.",Scooby-Doo
59,gftbiloxi,Mindless Fluff,5,21 April 2005,"The key to enjoying SCOOBY DOO is not to expect too much. The producers have billed the film as half homage, half parody; in truth, it isn't really close enough to the original cartoon to be called homage and it really doesn't go far enough to be called parody, and as usual Hollywood makes the mistake of trying to cover up the script's inadequacies with big-budget production values and expensive but actually so-so special effects. All the same, the film does have its moments. The story finds Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy splitting up due to ego conflicts--and then being unexpectedly reunited when the owner of a teen resort called ""Spooky Island"" invites them in to find out why his guests arrive as normal teens and then depart as, well, ZOMBIES.The script is fairly mundane, but it does have a few zingers, as when Velma says ""Let's get jinky with it!"" And although the cast is a mixed bag, they work hard to bring it off. Freddie Prinze is wildly miscast as Fred and Sarah Michelle Gellar is not an ideal Daphne, but they play with tremendous energy; Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini, however, are so dead on target with their performances that they create an amazing sense of deja vu. As for Scooby Doo, he is (of course) a computerized animation. And so are most of the monsters the gang encounters on Spooky Island. Although it works reasonably well, it isn't anything to write home about.I would recommend that parents preview the film before unleashing it upon their kids; some younger children may be unnerved by the monsters. The DVD comes with a number of extras that include some cut scenes--and they offer an interesting contrast with the film, for they are very satirical. Seeing them left me with the feeling that the film would have been much more entertaining if those scenes had been left in and the whole thing had been done with the same bite. As it is--SCOOBY DOO is neither a great film nor a memorable film. But we're all occasionally in the mood for some mindless fluff, and it fills that niche very well indeed.Gary F.

60,Hollywood_Yoda,See Scooby in Hi-Def!,4,26 September 2018,"This film was definitely different, and one of many animated television shows to get the live action treatment of Hollywood. The film might be most enjoyed by children, if they understand Scooby already. However, in order to enjoy the film as an adult, it has to be seen in hi-def: you either have to be high or deaf!Most of the acting is pretty terrible. It was pretty much the ending of Freddie Prinze's acting career, as he's almost unknown in 2018. The writing was so-so as Hanna Barbera could've done better. The sets and costumes were honestly the best part.With all the negatives, it still had a theatrical sequel and two made for TV sequels.

61,stamper,The inside scoop from inside the scoob',7,23 June 2003,"While I was watching Scooby Doo I could not help but think of another, very similar film I had seen a few years ago called Spy Kids. Now the only two reasons for remembering that one were that 1) it sucked and 2) it was directed by one of my favorite directors, called Robert Rodriguez. Where Spy Kids failed though, I saw Scooby Doo succeed. Not only was the film funny, due mostly to the effort the computer animated Scoobster and his voice (Mr. Neil Fanning), but it also made you feel happy. I thought the film was very charming and I was really relieved that there were no stupid or awkward scenes in the film (as I'd feared). This is mostly due (in my opinion) to the actors, who were very well cast and fitted their roles like a fresh set of gloves (by the way: I never seem to get tired of seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar playing a spoiled girl, or is it that I can't get tired of seeing her PERIOD?). 
I must admit that I needed a bit of time to get accustomed to the groove' of the film, but that does not mean I did not enjoy the whole product. And of course not everything was good in this film! I personally felt that Fred (die Prinze Jr.) was way too gay in the beginning and I thought that maybe due to Shaggy's way of behavior the film would have been better if placed in the 70's. But that is truly personal. Fans of the TV series for instance, might agree on these two points but come and introduce a whole list filled with criticism that could reach from the U.S.A. to Nippon whereas others would say: Scooby sucked' and yet others would say: Scooby rocked'. Despite all that, it is my opinion that younger children will enjoy this film and I even think that if you are 22 (like I am), you have an open mind and just want to be entertained (without any desire to think), you just might like this film. I won't watch Scooby Doo 2 in the cinema because although this film was fun, it wasn't that much fun. I'll wait for the rental instead.

Heck, even the cartoon didn't settle this much on fart-joke level... but even if the CGI is awful, the sets are nice and the villain is pretty cool.If you are a fan of Scooby-Doo, there is something to enjoy, but others will find the characters bland and uninteresting quickly.",Scooby-Doo
63,aesgaard41,Not The Movie I Wanted,9,29 June 2002,"SPOILERS: PLOT POINTS I've been a Scooby fan since near the beginning and I remember what it was like when it started out. It was Gothic and scary and played straight, but toward the end as Scooby talked more, it became more of just another cartoon. That's what I wanted to see, a return to the series roots instead of the animation brought to life. This movie could have been so much better centered on the kids and with a real Great Dane while they saved the graphics for the dog's stunts. The series origin was more like the kids looking for real ghosts and instead solving mysteries. Later on, it seemed as if they became unrealistic amateur detectives with a bit of undeserved notoriety. What the movie is a live-action cartoon from the weakest end of the series with every cartoon contrivance and animated snafu recreated in real life surroundings. Not much has been altered and nothing has been altered. It's just the cartoon in the real world instead of a real life Scooby gang. On the other hand, Matthew Lillard is the star to watch as he mugs, leers, grins and is more Shaggy than the animated counterpart. Sarah Michelle Gellar exudes more sex and cleavage here than as Buffy; in fact, even Cardellini gives Velma a bit of sex appeal when she wears a v-neck sweater instead of a turtle neck for a few scenes. Fred, however, is done wrong as Prinze portrays him as a dimwit in love with himself. Even Daphne is changed a bit, but it's for the better as a stronger character. Fred should have been played straight without looking for gags. Lillard and Cardellini, however, have Shaggy and Velma down pat from his cast-iron stomach to her love-hate thing with her glasses. The worst news is that Scrappy has been included in on this roller coaster ride as the worst wrench in the works. He should have been left out completely as he was the one worst thing to ruin the series. Whoever wrote the script obviously stole a few scenes from the million or so ""We Hate Scrappy"" websites. Rowan Atkinson becomes more live and animated than his Mr. Bean persona though and the bad guy from ""The Temple of Doom"" returns as well. The movie also has a number of bad jokes concerning body swapping and body noises, but on the whole, it's still worth a watch just to see the cartoon in our world. I also wouldn't mind seeing a sequel if such a thing were possible.",Scooby-Doo

65,Jack the Ripper1888,Best family comedy of the year.,10,23 June 2002,"I have been of fan of Scooby ever since I first saw an episode. And when this movie came out, I just had to see it. I love Scooby and I have probably seen just about every episode that there is. The beginning of the film starts off corny and you actually wonder if the writers had forgotten that they were writing an adaption of a cartoon rather than just writing another cartoon movie like the earlier SCOOBY-DOO ON ZOMBIE ISLAND. But after the first five minutes, things start going. The cast is perfect. No one else could portray the Scooby gang better. The cast includes Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardinelli, Rowan Atkinson and Scott Innes as the voice of Scooby-Doo. This is by far, the best comedy that I have seen this year. If you are a fan of Scooby, then you cannot afford to miss out on this one. My only complaint is that the monsters looked a little phony. But they were probably done that way as to not frighten the younger members of the audience. WARNING: there will be much stupid children laughter at scenes that are not funny!!! But, there is some adult humor thrown in every now and then. This is one damn funny movie.And to the reviewer that said she hated the movie so badly that she walked out and that the only reason she went was to see the new Harry Potter trailer, I give you credit for admitting how stupid you are for liking Harry Potter. Those of us who loved this movie (there are hundreds) are really intimidated, especially since Harry Potter will crash and burn at the box-office. SCOOBY-DOO: 5/5.",Scooby-Doo

But if you're going to make a live action movie, it's not a cartoon and it needs to be done differently.The computerization in the movie is terrible!! Scooby looks incredible fake and can be extremely annoying. Throwing in some adult glammer such as revealing clothing and sexual comments does not help the appeal of the show (is it for adults or kids). If this show was more for adults they should have gave it a serious tone with humour mixed in. If it was for kids it should have been toned down more to make it kid friendly.The story was predictable and the jokes were terrible.",Scooby-Doo

This movie has what you would expect to see in a Scooby-Doo show. I'm a huge fan of Scooby-Doo, and watched the animated series on Cartoon Network, so it's inevitable I would go and watch this, and I wasn't disappointed by it for the most part. Scooby-Doo was fun, entertaining and interesting from start to finish. It definitely had the mystery element in it especially once the gang headed into Spooky Island - that was my favourite part of the movie. I don't know about you, but this movie had me guessing right till the end, and I was very surprised to say the least. That's why I rate Scooby-Doo pretty highly. It's a good movie to watch when you're having snacks or ""scooby snacks"" or something.",Scooby-Doo

In addition to the characterization of the main characters (which for me is of paramount importance), the special effects are very well done. Each actor was true to his character, even with the changes (Daphne struggling), or even when they switched bodies. Matthew did very well as Sausage, who even became his voice actor.

And Scooby-Doo did work pretty well. The only problem was with the character like Scabby Doo and the ending might not appealed the kids that much.

74,LebowskiT1000,Better Than Expected,9,26 June 2002,"Being someone who grew up watching Scooby-Doo, I had high hopes for the film, but wasn't terribly impressed with the trailers to the film.  Don't get me wrong, I wanted to see it, but it wasn't a top priority.  Needless to say, I watched the movie, and was very happy with it after all.  Before I'd seen the film I was quite skeptical of Scooby being a CG character.  But as I watched the film I realized that I think that was the better way to go. First off, the character is being based on a cartoon, so what's the big deal if he still looks a little cartoony.  Secondly, HE'S A TALKING DOG!!!  So, anyway, I made my peace with the CG Scooby and accepted him.The movie's plot is quite thin and left me with a number of questions, but again, this is based on a cartoon so it's not a big deal if that plot is a bit questionable.The actors did a fine job with the film.  Freddy Prinze Jr. (Fred) did a fine job, as did Sarah Michelle Gellar (Daphne).  I was really impressed with Linda Cardellini (Velma), not just as an actress, but her beauty too. I thought she was WAY more attractive than Sarah Michelle Gellar!  I was also REALLY impressed with Matthew Lillard as Shaggy.  He NAILED that voice perfectly!  ...And I have to mention Isla Fisher (Mary Jane), what a beautiful woman, and a good actress too...I'll definitely be keeping my eyes open for her future work!  The rest of the cast was good as well.There were a few pleasant surprises in the film, so I won't spoil the surprises for you, you'll just have to go see the film.  I really hope you like the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Scooby-Doo
75,EmperorNortonII,"They ""Doo"" It So Well!",9,12 July 2002,"I grew up on TV cartoons, and Scooby-Doo is a character I remember very well.  So when the movie version of the adventures of Mystery, Inc. finally came out, I was looking forward to it.  And I was very pleased with what resulted!  ""Scooby-Doo"" has a lot of laughs, and more than a little self-parody.  In fact, you will enjoy this movie that much more when you recognize the spoofy elements.  Like Daphne finally getting fed up with her whole ""damsel in distress"" routine.  I was surprised that they included Scrappy-Doo in the story!  And, not to give too much away, but I notice a lot of Scrappy haters around, and I think their feelings will be justified. The best performance belongs to Matthew Lillard, who nails the role of Shaggy perfectly.  And Linda Cardellini is no slouch either as Velma.  And so, to the meddling kids of Mystery, Inc., I say, ""Meddle on, kids!""",Scooby-Doo
76,policy134,Totally inoffensive and quite boring to put it mild.,2,14 August 2005,"I was never a big fan of the old Scooby cartoons from Hanna-Barbera but I thought maybe the live-action movie could be interesting to watch, especially because it was a Warner Bros. release who are the best studio when it comes to animation and live-action mix. I was of course immensely disappointed. The opening scene where Fred (the always dull Freddie Prinze, Jr.) tries to hog the spotlight and the resulting split of the group is rather clever. It tampers with the conventions of the old show and that is usually why I like such features as this. Then we get to the main plot about the amusement park and all I can say is ""Who cares?"". Rowan Atkinson, who plays the shady owner, is definitely my favorite for the worst actor of the year.Each of the four human Mystery Gang members are performed as best as they could be, although I would have liked to see the role of Daphne played by another than Sarah Michelle Gellar because she is way too cool and to think of her as a damsel in distress is almost impossible. Of course, we all know that she and Prinze Jr. are a real life couple and that she was linked with the WB Network at the time, so that is pretty much all she wrote. Velma is the best reason why you should waste time seeing this because of the smart versus attractive element of her character and as many people have interpreted maybe she has a crush on Daphne. This is not put directly in your face of course because after all this is a movie for kids and the rather lame innuendo in Shaggy's van (it's smoking - well, I never) should have been cut. Not because it is going to far but because it is such an easy target to pursue.So the most positive thing you can say about Scooby-Doo is that you never see anything remotely offensive and that the characters are adequate. Scooby-Doo himself is of course annoying but you can't make the movie called Scooby-Doo and then not give him any screen time, although that what have been something. Frank Welker and Casey Kasem would probably not even show this to their own grandchildren and Joe Barbera would not even see it I suppose.",Scooby-Doo
77,elicopperman,One of my biggest guilty pleasures,4,30 October 2017,"When I was a little kid, I was a big fan of Scooby Doo, from the original cartoon, to the What's New Scooby Too show, to some of the animated movies. And two installments to the franchise that I practically binge watched as a little fella were these two live-action CGI hybrid Scooby Doo movies directed by Raja Gosnell and written by James Gunn (now famous for Guardians of the Galaxy 1 & 2). Then, after doing some research years later and finding out that it was supposed to be a PG-13 satire on the original cartoon but was soon bogged down by studio interference to make it more family oriented, I now see it as a laughable mess.Right off the bat, the story takes place after the Mystery Inc gang have split up, and then they are brought back together to solve the mystery of an island called...Spooky Island....subtle. Simple enough plot, and the film does keep it's idea afloat...but MAN is this film confused tone wise. Remember when I said that this film was originally supposed to be for teens before getting butchered for kids? Well boy, are there a lot of innuendos here, and without giving anything away, let's just say some of the material from the original script may have gotten in the final cut. The characters from the show are decent enough, and Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardellini and Neil Fanning do really good jobs impersonating Shaggy, Velma and Scooby...can't say the same for Freddie Prinze jr. and Sarah Michele Gellar as Fred and Daphne, as while they are trying, they come off more as bland stereotypes more than anything else. The best actor in the film is Rowan Atkinson, since....well, this Mr. Bean we're talking about, of course he's a riot.As for the production design, while the sets look gorgeous and there was certainly a lot of effort put into making them shine bright, the computer imagery of Scooby and the monsters that show up in the film look dated even by early 2000s standards, as they look painfully obvious with how much they stand out like sore thumbs. Overall...I honestly have nothing else to say. This movie is just ridiculous, the jokes are confused, the characters are hit or miss, the cgi is dated, and while it does try to stay true to the cartoon, it just comes off as a case of not knowing whether to be silly or to be a straight forward adaptation of the show. However, I will admit that I do have some nostalgia for it. Not too long ago, me and my friend were watching this, and alongside getting memories of childhood back, it had me on the floor just from how crazy the direction was, as well as the innuendos. So if you're in the mood for a movie with a confused tone but some many laughable choices, this is for you. However, if you love Scooby Too so much that you refuse to see this...better watch Mystery Incorporated, cause that will give you a more mature take on the franchise without coming off as juvenile or insipid. As for me though....sigh....it's such a guilty pleasure.",Scooby-Doo
78,Spanner-2,Entertaining if slight comedy,7,17 June 2002,"A fairly faithful adaption of the original cartoons with Scooby and the gang reuniting to try to figure out who is brainwashing the teenagers at Spooky Island. Matthew Lilliard does a dead-on impersonation of the cartoon Shaggy which is somewhat scary to witness... the rest of the cast is hit and miss. Linda Cardellini as Velma is fairly good, Freddie Prinze Jr. however seems to be stuck in some netherzone where he lives a permanent bad hair day... i dont remember the cartoon Fred being quite so vapid... Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne is ok in a poorly written part.. and the animated Scooby (voiced by Scott Innes, whose done the more recent cartoons) is acceptable, if not exactly ground breaking. The story itself is mostly entertaining, though it does drag in the mid-section a result of stretching a half-hour cartoon show into feature length i suppose.. If you liked the TV show this is based on and view it in that realm.. as a live action version of the show, this can be very enjotable.. if you didnt watch the show or didnt like it.. this one isnt for you. And.. for the fans.. the revelation of the ""big bad"" at the end is hillarious. GRADE: B",Scooby-Doo
79,TheMan3051,"Bad Scooby, Bad!",7,1 January 2003,"As a Scooby-Doo fan I was quite disappointed with this picture! It's nice that the creative team decided to add a little bit of all the shows in the movie. But I would have preferred if they would have focused more on the `70s show (like Scooby-Doo, Where are You?, The New Scooby-Doo Movies, and The Scooby-Doo Show) and on the recent animated movies (like Zombie Island and Cyber Chase) and have included MORE hidden jokes so both children and adults can enjoy. In a way I feel this movie isn't true to Hanna-Barbera's original vision and that bothers me! Especially since William Hanna passed away during pre-production, I believe.The movie had it's moments and Matthew Lillard was hilarious as Shaggy. Plus Linda Cardellini, who's WAY better looking then Sarah Michelle Geller did a pretty good job. Now Sarah and Freddie could have done better. Or they could have cast better actors.Hopefully the sequel will be better!2(**)out of 4(****)starsA little side note: (MAY CONTAIN SPOILER)The scene where they kick Scrappy out of the van was HILARIOUS!

80,chrisbrown6453,Scooby-Doo is fun entertainment for kids and fans of the cartoon series.,6,23 June 2002,"The Scooby-Doo gang are now veteran mystery solvers. Fame, if not fortune, has hit the group. However, things aren't going so well for our heroes. Fred has become egotistical and takes credit for the group's success. Velma feels under appreciated.  Daphne resents being the one that is always the damsel in distress. They decide to split up leaving Shaggy and Scooby all alone.
Two years later Shaggy and Scooby receive a mysterious invitation to Spooky Island, a scary amusement park. The park's creator, Mondavarious, requests their aid in solving a mystery. It turns out that all the college students coming to the island leave as brainwashed zombies. Shaggy and Scooby initially turn the invitation down, but relent with the promise of all the food they can eat (of course). At the airport they discover that the rest of the group has been invited, too. Thus Mystery Inc. tentatively reunites to solve the puzzle of Spooky Island.
I went into this movie very skeptical. In fact, after watching the first 10 minutes I thought, ""This is really going to suck."" However, the movie picked up and by the end I really enjoyed it. I thought it was about as close as you could get to putting a live action version of the cartoon on screen. For the most part, it is faithful to its origins. Characters try to run away and spin out in mid air. Scooby and Shaggy beg for Scooby Snacks. A villain complains about ""meddling kids"". It's pretty much everything you'd expect.While most of the cast is mediocre, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and the CGI Scooby-Doo really make the movie. Lillard nails the Shaggy character so perfectly that you'd think the cartoon was based on HIM. His voice and mannerisms are dead on. He also works perfectly with the CGI Scooby-Doo. Scooby is cartoony yet hilarious. He's just like the cartoon character as well. While acting rather human-like, he's still not above chasing the occasional cat. He's also guided by his stomach rather than his brain. One funny scene features Scooby getting a phone call. A creepy voice says, ""If you want all the hamburgers you can eat, go into the dark and scary woods where nobody can see you and meet me there."" ""OK!!"" he enthusiastically responds.The movie had my attention most of the way through, and that's a major feat. Luckily being kid friendly didn't mean they had to compromise on humor. There are some humorous references to rumors of Shaggy being a stoner and such that pass totally over kid's heads but the adults catch. Jokes about Scooby drinking out of the toilet, cleaning himself at Don Knott's party, and other such dog-related humor bring a lot of laughs, too.Besides that, this film had great sets and a fun soundtrack.
I don't know which Scooby-Doo cartoons these writers saw, but they must have seen something different than I did. I never remembered Freddie being an egotistical chauvinist. I didn't remember Daphne being the constant damsel in distress. I didn't remember Velma being ignored in credit for the captures. And I certainly didn't remember Scrappy Doo being an evil little pip squeak that everyone hated. Annoying? Yes. Misguided? Yes. Hated? Maybe only by the adult fans of the series, and that really shows up in this film. The characterizations of these characters are the only parts of the film that are unfaithful to the cartoon. This ties into the ending as well which I don't want to spoil here. I'll just say I found it a little disappointing.Most of the cast is pretty mediocre. Freddie Prinze Jr. stands out as the most miscast of the group. I could never get over him being blonde. It just didn't look right. Sarah Michelle Gellar was a lot of fun in the movie, but I never thought of her as the definitive Daphne. Lillard was just so perfect that he made the rest of the cast seem out of place.In the end Scooby-Doo could have been a total disaster, but winds up being some fun summer entertainment. Scooby-Doo has its problems, but it is still probably one of the better live action cartoon adaptations to come along.",Scooby-Doo
81,willcundallreview,A movie strictly for the little one's,3,11 April 2015,"Rating-3/10Yes, I have given this movie the highest kind of 3/10 and that really shows this film is bad, but actually somehow a strong kind of bad. Scooby-Doo the movie is really not all that great and suffers greatly as it is basically created so only kids can truly enjoy it, and kids might not anyway. Adults be foreworn, this is not a funny movie and not that well done, fun time but definitely not good whatsoever.The cast of the movie seem to have a great time and the characters do work well, only problem is it isn't acted well and stars such as Freddie Prinze Jr and Sarah Michelle Gellar don't contribute enough or much at all to the cause. On a positive note I felt Matthew Lillard does well as Shaggy and his crazy feel is pretty nice to see not to mention the spot on voice he does in which he fits into the role well. I quite liked Rowan Atkinson's role in the movie, he isn't in it near enough but he does what you would expect of him, just gets brought down with the film itself.Raja Gosnell directs this just a little too fast and makes it feel too much like he asked some kids to help out, yet again only for kids this movie. The writing Is also the same story as the direction and it is just not well done, it does a better job than the directing yet still comes up with nothing to save this. I think it just feels too much like a typical adventure film and one that I feel I have seen before, even if this is distinctly Scooby-Doo.I did like the setting of the film and the location is picked perfectly for what they are trying to do, only problem is that the effects are pretty poor(OK it was 2002, but still designed a bit silly). I felt the animated version of Scooby was OK and actually with this Scooby-Doo truly isn't the main character, although he figures in the majority of the plot. If you watch this or have watched it then the costumes are one of the main memorable things, they are truly ridiculous and although yes the same as the cartoon clothes, just look insane in real life.I said before about kids enjoying it and they should, the jokes are crude in a child's kind of way and the characters are fun I would think for maybe a 5 year old. There is no doubt the producers wanted a family friendly movie here but I must add that this does have some more extreme versions of the things encountered in the cartoons so for scared little children, this could actually give them a fright. So overall Scooby-Doo is a passable piece of entertainment and one film I will quickly forget, it is just too lousy and stale to be a movie that succeeds and although this did do well at the box office, don't let it fool you. It even spawned a sequel but again I will say don't let it fool you, for too long movies have been made with no direction or edge and this is among them, fun I can say yes but an insult to your humour, well a definite yes on that one.",Scooby-Doo
82,TheEmulator23,deep?,5,22 January 2003,"Is it deep?  No.  Is it juvenile? Well of course!  Is it funny?  Well only if you enjoy fart jokes, and Matthew Lillard doing a very suprisingly good Shaggy.  I loved the cartoon as a child, and still find some of the cartoons funny, but to me Casey Kasem will always be the voice of Shaggy.  (Still have to give credit to Matthew though.)  It is a dumb plot of course, but filled with moments i am sure i would have loved when I was six.  Maybe because I tried to revert my thinking back to when I was six, I was able to appreciate it the best I could.  I am sure the sequel will have the same kinda of plot, and that Scooby will look even more realistic.  Even though this will not be considered a classic...ever, kids, and the adults that watched this as children will still enjoy it.",Scooby-Doo

Unfortunately there is more film than these two main characters can carry. [I.e.

84,Mort-31,Opinion of a non-Scoobyist,5,16 October 2002,"I saw the cartoon series when I was a child but I didn't remember anything of it. Then I went to see the new real life movie (with the dog still animated) with two friends who had similar Scooby experiences (that is practically none). We could figure out how the series works (e. g. that Daphne always gets caught and that Velma is the smart one aso.), and interestingly, we could more easily laugh about the inside jokes than about actual gags like Shaggy and Scooby farting and belching around.The set decoration is very colourful, almost gaudy but I guess this has to be so to make the animated dog appear relatively realistic.
Rowan Atkinson is wonderful  not only by his British accent he stands out from the rest of the cast, who (this has to be admitted) seem to be well chosen concerning their optical appearance. By the way, the three of us agreed that  unless he wasn't necessary for the final development of the story  the most annoying character in the movie would be that stupid dog (sorry, fans)! They should have taken Melvin Doo instead!",Scooby-Doo

86,Brooklynsmagicmike,LOVED this movie,9,13 April 2020,"I have been scooby doo fan for years and watched most of the cartoons. For some reason I never watched the live action movie of it.Keep in mind I'm a guy in his late 20's and I will say that this movie despite the PG rating to me felt more towards older teenage audience. Quite few jokes were raunchy as well as Characters behaviors. But thats what made this movie enjoyable. I don't think back when it came out or even now kids aged 11 or under would really understand alot of what is going on in the movie.Back to the review. The action is good, the comedy is great, the actors are all awesome in there roles, and the storyline is pretty engaging and found the pacing to be good. Also for a movie thats 18 years old still looks great today maybe even better then some of the other movies similiar to this type of content.Overall definitely would recommend this movie to older teens to younger adult.

88,the amorphousmachine,Matthew Lillard STEALS the show.,7,16 June 2005,"Seriously, 'Scooby Doo' should not be 4.8 on IMDb. Does anyone remember the cartoon as not being cheesy. Cause 'Scooby Doo' the movie is a) a kid's film primarily and b) very very cheesy.....but it's a lot of fun. This film belongs to a CGI cartoony Scooby Doo and Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. Could you imagine anyone else playing Shaggy? I can't! I could imagine anyone else playing the rest of the cast easily, but don't get me wrong, they did a good job too- particular Linda Cardillini as the geeky Velma. But really, Matthew Lillard is so impressive in this film as it is he steals the show as practically a replica in live-action of the cartoon character in Shaggy. And let's face it, they had to get Shaggy right and they did! I also liked the reference to Scrappy Doo as the Mystery Inc. team member who hogged the glory, which nicely took a swipe at how direction of the cartoon went with Scrappy Doo in it. Also, the fact that Scrappy was the bad guy (errr, puppy) was funny too. Freddie Prince Jnr, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Isla Fisher and Rowan Atkinson do a fine job in this fun flick. If you're looking for intellectual educational stimulation, then why are you watching this movie? If you are disgruntled fan of the cartoon that hates the movie, then what did you expect? Cause, in my mind, it's a pretty faithful film to the dynamic of a really cheesy cartoon. It's basically a live action version of a very cheesy cartoon. Unlike 'Garfield', the live action version of 'Scooby Doo' works fine. And although 'The Flintstones' movie did a reasonably good job with John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, I think Matthew Lillard's Shaggy is the most accurate depiction of a cartoon character to date!***½ out of *****!",Scooby-Doo
89,shanfloyd,Totally destroys the original spirit.,4,24 June 2005,"I was an avid fan of the original cartoon series as a kid. So I was indeed delighted to know that finally there's going to be a big screen adaptation. But I think it's better to tell the truth quite plainly -- this is one of the worst cartoon-to-film adaptations ever. It totally destroys the original spirit of the film. Scrappy Doo is the villain? What were they thinking? Is there such lack of villainous characters? And the basic idea with ""protoplasm""! My goodness! Can film-making reach such a low level? And characterization: this Fred is nothing like the original, cool-headed, sensible Fred we see in the cartoons. And finally for Scooby himself, he is one of the most pathetic CGI characters I've ever seen. See what treat he's given: he dresses up like Grandma! Such screenplay.But it didn't have to be like this. The casting, I must say, is quite appropriate. Linda Cardellini is awesome as Velma and so is Matt Lillard as Shaggy. Really the performances of these two steal the show in this otherwise pathetic movie. Sarah Gellar looks alright as Daphne and I won't mind Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred as long as they keep his character correct. The whole movie crashed down due to lack of a decent plot. Apart from that it really had potentials to become a fan favorite.",Scooby-Doo
90,The_Wood,Front-runner for the worst film of the year. 1/10,1,18 June 2002,"I dislike the Scooby-Doo movie immensely. The film is absent of charm; humor; or anything that would classify it as being worthwhile entertainment. Children will not enjoy this film, it's far too ugly and odd. For parents, the film is the equivalent to Chinese water-torture. Out of the entire running time of the movie, there may be 1 minute in the film that contains anything that is genuinely clever or funny. This film is bad on so many levels, I feel nauseated talking about it.",Scooby-Doo

94,SMLA11,Good children's movie,6,2 June 2002,"I have recently gotten the chance to catch a free screening of this and I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it.  I never liked Scooby Doo whenever I was a kid, so i was really wondering if I should see this.  I decided to see it and review it.  It turns out that it was a good children's movie.  Any kid who likes Scooby Doo should definitely see this.  I don't like Scooby Doo the television show but this isn't half bad.  The only thing I thought was good was the acting by the characters.  Matthew Lillard is a good Shaggy, and his performance was pretty good.  Linda Cardellini, Freddie Prinze JR., and Sarah Michelle Gellar are all good as what they are given and they fill all of the characters with what they need to bring out.  I didn't particularly like the movie, though.  But you've got to think, this isn't my kind of movie.  I mean I'm not going to buy this on DVD or see it at the theaters again but I was happy I had the chance to see it.  The person who did the voice of Scooby and Scrappy do pretty good voice impressions.  If you're a kid, and you like the show, I suggest you go see this.Overall the movie was good performance-wise but I didn't like the humor or the storyline(remember, I'm in my 20s) but I'm sure children will like the humor and story.  Rating 7 out of 10.",Scooby-Doo
95,Gubby-Allen,OK,5,24 July 2002,"Potentially Scooby Doo was & could still be, a very good film, but it was let down solely by the plot.Unlike others I thought the casting was good & there were some good performance, Shaggy particularly & some good scenes & funny moments.Unfortunately, the storyline was one, largely alien to Scooby Doo, the cartoon & it's viewers. They should've stuck to the tried & tested ""old Fred Bloogs, the Lodger in the Shed scaring visitors away"" rather than indulging in face & soul swapping & brainwashing.The pleasure of Scooby Doo is the element of mystery & the whodunnit. There was no real mystery in here at all & nothing to keep the viewer guessing.The farting & burping scene seemed merely to appease the 3 year olds in the audience, the characterisations seemed a little too different to the originals & I wasn't convinced by 'Scrappy as Villain', but there was enough in the film to still make it a fairly good effort all round.A low 5/10",Scooby-Doo
96,mirosuionitsaki2,"Scooby Doo, Where Are You?",7,23 July 2007,"So yeah, I don't really remember if I have seen this movie in the theaters, pay-per view, or DVD but I do remember I saw this movie and this movie is.. what should I say.. it's good. Just not great.Here's why. Since when has Scrappy-Doo, if that's the little dog's name, been evil? Why would he be kicked out of the gang because he's a dog and he urinated on Daphne? Scooby-Doo does worse and he doesn't get kicked out. So this just doesn't make any sense.This movie has selected the worse actors to play Daphne, and Fred? Linda Cardellini was good to play Velma though. Maybe they chose Freddie Prinze Jr. because his name is Fred, also, they thought he was a good actor. Maybe it's just the name. Fred doesn't act like he listens to hip hop and hes flirty. Since when was he immature in the series? Maybe in some of the movies, but he wasn't that much immature in the movies.Why did they choose Buffy's Sarah Gellar to play Daphne? I don't see Daphne acting that much of a prep in the series. She's rich, but I don't see her acting that much as a preppy snob. And I didn't mind that. I just didn't think Sarah Gellar should've played Daphne. She didn't fit the part and she doesn't even look like her.But anywho, everything else was great, except the characters besides Velma and Shaggy and Scooby, and except Scrappy.I recommend this movie if you like Scooby Doo.. Since all this was just my opinion. Everyone else seemed to like it so I guess.. Yeah.",Scooby-Doo

I thought it did a very good job of making the transfer between the cartoon and to the real screen. I have to say that the acting was perfect for all of the characters. Shaggy sounds like shaggy and acts very well. Surprisingly this movie did have a fairly good mystery. This movie actually did have a central plot, and did pretty good making an interesting story. Though this isn't may favorite movie ever, I will say it is always enjoyable to watch so I watch every once in a while. When you re-watch the movie you will actually see a lot of clues throughout the entire movie.",Scooby-Doo
99,son_of_cheese_messiah,"More Doo-doo than Scooby, more crappy than scrappy",1,13 September 2009,The original Scooby Doo cartoons were silly and predictable but had a certain charm and colour which has endeared them to a generation of kids. A later series added Scrappy who was the most irritating cartoon character before the intentionally irritating Poochie in the Simpsons. Scrappy's contribution to this shocker is him pointlessly urinating on Thelma (obviously no one house trained him) at which point this tiresome character is dropped out of the mystery machine.Don't worry though there's plenty more tiresome characters where he came from.Extremely juvenile comedy with a lot of knowing postmodern irony topped off with over the top cgi monsters. The original poorly drawn cartoon looks positively sublime and subtle by comparison.Avoid.,Scooby-Doo
100,BJJManchester,The Cartoon Show Was Far Better,3,9 April 2006,"A very disappointing live-action version of the long-running TV cartoon franchise,which perhaps suggests it would've been a better idea keeping the concept as animation.The film actually gets off to a fair start,with the familiar fake ghost device which was used to such enjoyable effect in the TV shows,and even Pammy Anderson(who herself often looks so artificial in real life that she could easily pass as a cartoon character!)has a quite amusing cameo.Thereafter,the film saddles itself with a rambling uninteresting plot,a witless script,and banal and uninventive incident combined with not particularly impressive special effects which overwhelm any chance of interest in the characters.Matthew Lillard's performance is actually perfectly good considering the circumstances,but like all the other main parts,it is terribly underwritten.Capable and beautiful young actresses like Isla Fisher and Sarah Michelle Gellar(who is mostly reduced to indulging in sub-Buffy-like martial arts combat)are given no chance to shine,though this is not surprising given the dull,leaden dialogue they are given.The superb Rowan Atkinson is totally wasted in his part which had comic potential,and Scooby Doo himself is a considerable letdown,lacking the charm of his cartoon equivalent(the curiously hollow-eyed visage here makes him less sympathetic and even sinister on occasion).As for the ever-irritating Scrappy Doo,forget it.The film also has some especially dismal would-be jests about breaking wind and urinating,utterly out of context with this concept and it fails completely. All in all,an over-produced effort which should've taken much more time on script and character,which generally the much,much less expensive old cartoon TV show did so to much more entertaining effect.More millions spent does not a superior version make.Definitely in this case.",Scooby-Doo
101,BabelAlexandria,This One is Anti-Nostalgic,6,9 October 2021,"I had vaguely positive recollections of Scooby-Doo as a child, but this movie let me realize just how stupid the show really was. There are a few important differences from the animated series, however: first of all, this adds a heavy serving of frat-boy humor, which usually falls flat. Probably marketing figured out that most childhood Scooby Doo watchers were college age in 2002. Strangely, this was mixed with plenty of satire about the cliched main characters, which was the best part of the movie. My kids were not particularly impressed either: they hated the main characters (thank God!), though my son found Scooby hilarious. The main symptom of the plot's vapidity was the villain, ""Scrappy Doo,"" who was not a part of the original show (I think), and apparently wanted to destroy the team, along with the rest of the world, because they threw him out of the Mystery Van a while back for annoying everyone. It was also interesting to see some scenes that, twenty years on, would be highly problematic: e.g. When Fred and Daphne swap bodies and the subsequent foibles of Daphne/Fred.",Scooby-Doo

Linda Cardellini, a better then perfect ""Velma Dinkley"" due to her body, AND her portrayal was spot on too. I was not impressed with ""Fred or Daphne"" the characters were not at all true to the original cartoon.(I am 41). Scooby-Doo himself tho not perfectly animated or ""cg'ed"" was true to the character. The story was silly and also pretty true to the cartoon, as were the chase scenes, well not quite as crazy as the cartoon, after all these are real people not cartoon characters.All in all worth the waste of the 80 or 90 minutes that it is long, ex-specially when spent with my son, who was glued to it.",Scooby-Doo

For a comedy adventure lasting less than 90 minutes to drag like this requires direction of ferocious mediocrity. Raja Gosnell has that in spades.Admittedly, the director does have to work with the charisma void that is Freddie Prinze Jr and Sarah Michelle Gellar whose range is about as wide as her arse. Plus points go to Matthew Lillard for, like, his spot-on Shaggy and cutie Cardellini as Velma. The CG Scooby works in a doesn't-do-much kinda way, and the movie has a suitably cartoonish look and throws in a couple of nice nods to the original show, but it all seems to have been put together without any real feeling.Saying that this is better than The Flintstones is like comparing Britney to Christina Aguilera.

After a two-year disbandment, the group reunites to investigate a mystery on a popular horror resort called Spooky Island.The movie was not well received by critics, but it was enough to spawn a sequel released in 2004, and a telefilm prequel, aired on Cartoon Network on September 13, 2009.This movie is a really great film and critics did take this the wrong way, but they did like some of the things done right and some of the fans really liked this movie.The story is amazing and to the script writer's credit James Gunn, who directed Marvel's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and the film does stay true to the TV show.

Scooby Doo and Tom & Jerry where truelly my childhood cartoons, Tom and Jerry, as far as I know, was never made into live action but Scooby Doo didn't have such luck, when I was young and saw the live action Scooby Doo film I hated it a lot, so much in fact that I think I enjoyed it much more in this rewatch.
I feel like it does have some charm to it, unlike most other live action cartoon adaptations and I actually liked Matthew Lillard as Shaggy but that really isn't enough to make the film good in my opinion.
The acting is mostly not very good, the special effects are really bad in my opinion, especially the demons or wathever they are, they look so bad!! I also think that the film has a really cheap feel to it wich is something that I really don't like.

110,rcolgan,Another Pointless Remake,4,14 May 2015,"If there's one thing that Hollywood likes to do it's to get a hold of something that's popular and try to milk as much money out of it as possible. Scooby-Doo is an unfortunate case of this where Warner Bro's rook one of television's most recognisable animated icons and turned him into a CGI monstrosity.The film begins with the entire team disbanding due to personal conflicts. However this is somewhat undermined when they're all back together again two scenes later where they are reformed by Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) to investigate his amusement park on Spooky Island. Does the fact that the characters split up have any real difference on their dynamic? Not really. Every so often the characters will act insecure about themselves with Daphne wanting to be independent more and Velma not wanting to get picked last, but other than that there is no real difference on their dynamic.For the most part the cast is pretty bland. Whilst Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar and Lynda Cardellini all look like their respective members of the scooby gang, they don't really get much to work with due to the script turning them into nothing more then very dull caricatures with extremely exaggerated insecurity issues that seem to come out of nowhere. On top of this the talents of Rowan Atkinson and Isla Fisher are also wasted also being given nothing in the film to do. The only exception in this cast is Matthew Lillard who matches the animated Shaggy in every way from his energetic movement to his great imitation of the green shirted stoner. Also Scooby-Doo himself isn't dreadful. The voice factor Neil Fanning who plays him does get Scoobies voice spot on. Also just like Shaggy, Scooby is written with the same kind of stupidity and zaniness as his animated counterpart. But unfortunately all this is ruined by the ugly CGI. Whilst the animators did go through decent effort to bring the fast paced movements from the animated series to the live action adaptation, the CGI model of him just makes it unpleasant to watch. In contrast to the lovable 2D design, this CGI counterpart ends up looking as scary as the monsters that they were supposed to be fighting in the film.Although the film's biggest downfalls is it doesn't know what kind of film it wanted to be. According to Sarah Michelle Gellar, when she was cast in the film it was originally written to be a darker PG-13 comedy but it was changed to be family friendly after the casting. This unfortunately shows in the film quite often with the humour constantly shifting tones from family friendly gross-out humour like Scooby and Shaggy having a farting contest to stoner references like Shaggy falling in love with a girl called Mary Jane. Sometimes it's extremely mean spirited with Scooby at one point punching Fred in the face very violently whilst at others it's the child friendly slapstick with the standard over the top chases that Scooby Doo is known for. The film throws so many different styles at us, possibly in the attempt to appeal to all audiences, that it lacks any consistent tone.Whilst not the worst remake of a classic TV show that's come out (particularly considering the likes of Transformers and Smurfs that have come out since), this remake of Scooby-Doo remains a disappointment. It's not awful with some occasional laughs and it does have a decent soundtrack. But if you want to enjoy Scooby-Doo you'd be better off enjoying him on the silver screen",Scooby-Doo

Now I have seen all of these a doesen times, I have some of these on DVD. I've also seen two of the Tv series of it. It is a good idea because it is a very good kids film. So I understand why it is quit a bad rating not so bad as a few films I suppose. It is funny at times and exiting and not to slow of a starter either. But it does have it's boring bits , but then all films do though don't they, even the Godfather for a few minutes, but it is still really enjoyable. the 2nd is better still. My favorite film at the moment though is Batman. Dark Knight and it is so high it's 9/10. which IS GOOD. This film still is good though and is quit relaxing film at times. And a very good way to start a decent sequel but it is a bit bad. But if you like the second I think a few of you will like this only if you haven't seen it. It has less monsters though. But it still has a lot of creativity. It works well with lots of mysteries because that is what Scooby- doo genuinely is. And it does take them a while to guess who did the nasty stuff. But it was Daphne who did ring the police so they could take the nasty guys away. If your a kid it's probably going to be 7/10 and if your an adult probably 5.7/10 that's kind of how it probably genuinely is anyway like most Scooby-Doo films end that way.",Scooby-Doo

114,leoxatzian,Simply doesn't live up to the cartoon's high standards.,3,13 June 2019,"The only thing in this movie that could be considered an almost perfect representation of the source material is the character of Shaggy Rogers. Mathew Lillard fells like he was tailor-made for this role not just because he looks and sounds exactly like him, but also because his infectious enthusiasm and undying commitment to it makes him almost as entertaining as his animated counterpart. Other than that, the rest of the movie falls victim to jokes that almost never work, dreadful CGI effects and an incomprehensibly dull plot, resulting in an adaptation whose failure is an easy mystery to figure out.",Scooby-Doo
115,smashattack,THIS is Scooby-Doo?,3,29 December 2002,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but always in the end of Scooby-Doo mysteries, weren't the spirits, ghosts, and ghouls always explainable?  There were never really any ghosts, but rather people just feigning as them.Major, major spoilers.Scooby Doo the movie is a terrible version of the old cartoons.  I'm not too familiar with the old series, but I know for sure that there were NEVER ghosts or hauntings or anything of the sort.  However, Scooby Doo the movie breaks into more foolish ground by changing all that, flinging the series into a sort of stupid science fiction fantasy movie.  We have large gremlin-looking creatures that want to take over the world (and they aren't masks), and PROTOPLASMS, which supposedly make up the soul of a human being.WRONG!  A protoplasm is the essential living thing inside a CELL.  Not a person.  Somebody didn't do enough research!  It was almost as if they used the word ""protoplasm"" just to sound cool.  Why, when a little bit of skimming through a dictionary will prove that you're a total idiot who hasn't done any research?Scooby Doo is a movie filled with assumptions, crummy jokes, and a really perverted Fred, who wasn't like that at all in the series.  The mystery is so lame that no ""clues"" were needed to solve it.  It was just WHAM! and the bad guy came out of hiding.One part I did like, though, was when the whole group entered the ""haunted castle"".  It was rather thrilling for a moment, while the axes were swinging, the roller coaster was blasting forward, and Shaggy and Scooby were stuck on a wall.  The music was really good, too, I think.  But that's about the only good thing about the entire movie.Scooby Doo was one of the worst CGI characters I have ever seen.  They might have done better with a real dog, and not some plastic-looking CGI dog that could walk like a human.  I understand the original Scooby could, but that was the original, and it was a cartoon.  This is much different with live action.And the villain was so poorly introduced.  Even Count Dooku from Star Wars: Attack of the Clones had a longer run time!  Scrappy was only seen for a few moments, and only from a story told by one of the characters.  And then he showed up in the end... how stupid!  I'm sorry, but this movie was lacking in depth from every single angle.One other good thing about it, though, is the friendship between Shaggy and Scooby.  Those actors were PERFECT for the roles.  Shaggy sounds just like the original.  I'm impressed.  The antics of Shaggy and Scooby help to lighten the movie and for a while I thought it would bring the movie back up.  But I was wrong.  It lost concentration less than halfway through.Attempts to modernize the movie were poor.  Acting was insufficient (other than Shaggy and Scooby).  Story and plot were crumbling to pieces at the beginning.  The music was decent in some parts, when no rock bands were trying to keep the teenager atmosphere with crummy lyrics and silly music.All in all, Scooby Doo was a total flop.  I'm not sure what happened.  But I know that even I could have done better.  Just by staying true to the cartoon could that have been accomplished.",Scooby-Doo
116,n-mo,It works...,4,22 May 2020,"... about as well as a soggy potato chip.Let's start with the positives. Linda Cardellini is great as Velma and Matthew Lillard is as has been said uncannily spot-on as shaggy. The Scooby CGI isn't half-bad, for the period. The Scrappy-Do treatment is incredibly satisfying for adults who found him an annoying Mary Sue.Unfortunately, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne and her now-husband Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred just don't cut it, acting-wise, and this dampers the chemistry of Mystery, Inc. pretty badly. And the script doesn't make enough clever use of Scooby and Shaggy to really show off their chemistry.Ultimately the film's problem is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be a ""wink-wink"" to adults who remember the show fondly or kiddie fare for the little tykes. It tries to do both and comes up flat. To this end, some of the racier innuendos were omitted from the final cut, though they wouldn't have redeemed the movie had they remained: they weren't very subtle or pertinent.The movie needed a stronger Daphne and Fred, as well as a more determined showcasing of the ""nuts and bolts"" of the original series, with self-referential, double-layered humor. That's a pretty tall order, but it shouldn't be impossible working on the kind of predictable template Scooby Doo offers. Actually, it's the only way a movie based on such a franchise could possibly work.",Scooby-Doo
117,nixskits,"'Rooby, 'Raggy and Relma",8,8 December 2009,"The thing about writing and posting comments for IMDb is at first the world is wide open and you can pontificate about just what you want. Not being allowed multiple comments for one entity, you have to pick and choose certain things for whatever you're going to give an opinion on. Many people are perhaps too harsh on some films and others too sentimental about their raves.I was shocked there already were 482 comments for ""Scooby Doo"" and that the vote average is a pitiful 4.7 from 23916 different ""Dooers"". It's ""loved it"" filter kicks in at 4.7 also, so if you voted at least a 5, your BS can go on that rave record for the big screen version of so many now adults' fave cartoon from the olden days of animation (pre ""The Simpsons""). And there are over 50 perfect 10 reviews for this live action craziness.I adore Isla Fisher and Matthew Lillard as actors and Linda Cardellini is a goddess to me. Let's keep my thoughts about certain other people in this film under wraps for the time being. Lillard as ""Shaggy"" and Linda as ""Velma"" are as good as it gets for human incarnations of drawings. Their comic gifts are the saving grace of this far from perfect film. Check out Linda's wonderful deleted scene where she belts out ""You're Too Good To Be True"". Is there another actress this versatile out there now? She's the modern update of the classic movie queen who could sing, dance and act. The whole point of ""Scooby Doo"" is silly fun at nobody's expense, except for that little bastard Scrappy! Whoever came up with a fricking nephew for Scoob must have been freebasing too many ""snacks"" back in the 70s!This film is suitable for little ones and any drug references should be dealt with by their parent(s), who probably had a bit of ""Mary Jane"" back in their teens. This movie isn't the downfall of civilization, it's a cartoon in human form.",Scooby-Doo
118,shaid,Faithful to its origins,7,27 June 2002,"This movie is based on the cartoon series from the 70's and doing a good job in keeping the atmosphere of that series. It's true that the characters remain one dimensional and some of the jokes don't work but it's still a film that evoke old memories(and Pre-knowledge is a must because otherwise you will get lost at the no-logic the film show). It's not a master work(and no one intended it to be such) but the acting is spot on in transferring the figures from the cartoon to the big screen. The film is not even trying to be super smart, you can guess who the villain is if you have the brain.By this point you are sure I hated the film. I didn't. I enjoyed quite a lot. It was pure fun for me. I didn't have to use my brain cell for this one and I couldn't care less. I'll probably forget it in a few days and that's fine with me. It's like a roller-coster ride- fast ride which end before you mange to get use to it.",Scooby-Doo
119,mjplysaght,"This film is cheesy as hell, but I can't bring myself to hate it",6,30 March 2017,"So, before I go any further, this film is pretty stupid. The director, Raja Gosnell is best known for a bunch of pandering kid's films. The common approach that I hate with this branch of ""kid's films"" is that there's no attempt to intellectually challenge the kid audience. It's always cheesy lines, pointless slapstick, and jokes about farting or basic toilet humour. Kids deserve better than that, in my opinion.That being said, this movie is still a guilty pleasure of mine. It's incredibly over-the-top and full of energy, yet the dialogue and story lines are so childish. Apparently, early drafts of the script were meant to include more adult themes, such as addressing the fact that Shaggy is actually a stoner, and Velma a lesbian. The film actually goes the safer kid-friendly route, although they do leave in some questionable scenes such as when Fred's soul gets transferred into Daphne's body and ""she"" says the line, ""I can look at myself naked"", which is still jarring to me after I saw the film in the cinemas as a child. Another example is when we see smoke coming out of the Mystery Machine, alluding to Shaggy being a stoner, only to reveal that he's barbecuing.The film is harmless, really and most of the cast perform well. Matthew Lillard does a pitch perfect performance of Shaggy, Linda Cardellini's Velma is fairly accurate, Sarah Michelle Gellar's Daphne is done all right, even though with the inclusion of her apparently being a martial arts master, that it brought up a tonne of Buffy the Vampire Slayer parallels. The one weak link of the human protagonists is Fred, played by Freddie Prinze Jr. He comes across like a conceited tool throughout the film. Typical paint by numbers ""leader."" The story is pretty standard although it does go a bit off the rails by the end. As I said, it's a harmless film, that for the most part, the kids will enjoy, if they have the stomach for the CGI monsters.",Scooby-Doo
120,Streetwolf,Buffy on steroids,7,29 June 2002,"After hearing and reading so negatively about this movie, I thought I might as well watch it being a Buffy the vampire slayer fan and a Scooby Doo cartoon fan and I have to admit it was pretty good.SUMMARY:The Mystery Inc. decide to go their separate ways after they disagree on so many things.Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.) loving the spotlight and taking credit causes problems with Velma (Linda Cardellini) and Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) gets tired of always being the bait leaving Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and Scooby (Um...the dog!) to take the Mystery Inc. van and heading out to where ever they can find food. After a while each of them get invited to Spooky Island where they are to solve a mystery of why people leave as zombies after they have been there for a while leading them to team up once again yet unknowingly an old friend has become a foe and has much more in store for the Mystery Inc. than they can possibly imagine.Matthew Lillard does a wonderful job of portraying Shaggy, whilst everyone else seems to manage their roles somewhat okay. Sarah Michelle Gellar has a great fight scene in the movie, which was hilarious and the only thing I didn't like was Freddie Prinze Jr.'s hairdo...Rowen Atkinson's appearance surprised me and it was terrific to see him but he forgot to bring along his Mr. Bean/Blackadder humor. Scooby Doo's role was a little too far-fetched and we all could have done with a lot more of Scrappy Doo in it as well but it was still funny.I'd give it a 7/10.",Scooby-Doo
121,paul_supercala,"A disgraceful, soul-less live action version of the classic cartoon that will shatter your good image of the `real' Scooby Doo. Avoid it at all costs!",2,11 June 2002,"Yep, it's every bit as awful as it looks in the preview. Taking all of the fun and camp that made the cartoon so memorable, you get an empty, soul-less teenybopper version of the classic animated series. If you can't tell by the cast (Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, etc.) that it's going to be disgraceful, than with any luck the sight of the frightening CGI Scooby will turn you away.While Scooby may be the one with the title, he was never overbearing like he is in this flick. He does a little too much talking and is closer to Jar Jar Binks than the `real' Scooby Doo. It's tough to say that the once loveable pooch was annoying, but he was. The rest of the cast was OK. Past sins of their career temporarily forgiven, Prinze and Gellar, are fine as Fred and Daphne and Linda Cardellini does a pretty good Velma. The real star (and saving grace) was Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. His dead-on take on everyone's favorite stoner was quite impressive, but not enough to save the sinking ship.Director Raja Gosnell (whose unfunny credits include `Home Alone 3' and `Big Momma's House') doesn't do much to liven up James Gunn's lousy script. Let's think about this for a minute here: `Scooby Doo' is a trusted brand name and potential franchise and the studio in entrusting the director of `Home Alone 3' and the writer of `Tromeo and Juliet' to make this a winner?Where did it go so wrong? Where did it break down? Was it the farting dual between Shaggy and Scooby? Was it the guest appearances by Pamela Anderson and Sugar Ray? Was it everyone's least favorite character Scrappy Doo (think Son of Jar Jar) as a surprise main character? Was it trying to make Scooby use `hip lingo'? Maybe it was the combination of all of these with the fact that this wasn't made for anyone over the age of 12 or anyone with a developed sense of humor.If you were ever a Scooby Doo fan, avoid this one at all costs. Do not taint your good memory of him. If you've never seen it, this isn't the time for a poor introduction. Do yourself a favor and watch the cartoon first if you really have to go. You can wait for video if you'd like, but there's no reason to. While there's probably already a sequel in the works, one can only hope that this one will tank (a la `Lost In Space') and there's won't be another, but we wouldn't be so lucky, would we?",Scooby-Doo

But I'm not complaining.  Scooby-Doo was fun, from start to finish.  And hey, it is based on a kid's cartoon after all, and ultimately this is geared toward the children's market... I think the fact that this film stars Sarah Michelle-Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr., largely considered key players among today's acting ITkids (teen ones at that), a lot of people might be expecting this to be a more mature outing for Scooby Doo and co.

They are college students that never go to school and are always on the road. They drive in a green van with a psychedelic flower on the side called ""The Mystery Machine"".2. ""Shaggy"" has always got the munchies, because his smoking something illegal. ""Scooby"" also has the munchies and talks! They both long for Scooby snacks and why? Because the snacks are laced with some experimental LSD, that made that dog talk.3. ""Fred"" dresses like and is therefore a total pimp. ""Daphine"" is his stable. Notice that they always go off together so that they can do some business. 4 ""Thelma"" is the brains of the operation that has got something other than ghosts on her mind.5. ""Scrappy Doo and Scobby Dumb"" Scoobys relitives. Ones a crack baby, thats why he is always getting into fights. The other did too much drugs and blew his mind.Put it all together...........THEY ARE DRUG RUNNERS! It makes perfect sense. They drive around from town to town and the supposed ""Ghost"" is actually the rival drug lord or gang that they try to oust. They come up with some elaborate scheme to get him and while its going on, ""Thelma"", who always seems to be absent at that moment, is off making the drop and collecting the money.

126,richard-wheeler,A very well created film.,10,22 October 2005,"A very well made film based on the canine character ""Scooby-Doo"". The cartoon from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. But this version of Scooby-Doo has a more modern identity especially when it comes to the music. E.g- Rock and Hip-Hop, but the film succeeded very well. This also refers to the characters and the Scooby Doo himself. It sounds just like Scooby-Doo and same thing with the mannerisms e.g- always hungry and cowardly at heart, and he would do anything for Scooby snacks. And it was not disappointing like Garfield and The Cat In The Hat. It seems for those cartoon characters, the screenwriter did NOT pay close attention to the details.The actors and actresses were very well chosen for this film and that mystery van, I was impressed with. It looks just like the one from the cartoon series. The creator of this film, James Gunn loved Scooby Doo since he was a child. He certainly paid close attention to the details of every character and set. Well Done, James!!! The film was about Shaggy (Matthew Williard) and Scooby ( Neil Fanning) going to ""Spooky Island"" and there at the airport, they bumped into Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr), Velma (Linda Cardellini)and Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar). The group split up due to a scrap they had at the last mystery search, and in the end they all reunite once more. And Shag fell in love with a girl on the plane named Mary Jane (Isla Fisher).Anyways, when the group got to the island, it looked like "" Voodoo Hawaii"" to me with all those voodoo-like Tiki Gods and that bridge made of elephants tusks. The island was owned by Emile Mondaverious (Rowan Atkinson); and he told the gang that he believed someone was casting spells on the students due to their behavior. E.g- Acting in an aggressive manner. Now, this was what made this film better to the cartoon series, they were no longer fantasy disguised villains, there were monsters! Soon, the group met at the Spooky Castle on the top of the mountain, it used to be some spooky ride. There was another thing that I am sure of what all Scooby Doo lovers have seen in the cartoon series. Shag and Scoob always stick together when it comes to a mystery when the gang splits up.Well, enough of that. Back to the amulet story, Velma was observing the hieroglyphics on the amulet which Daphne discovered at Spooky Castle when the giant amulet nearly swallowed her up. Velma opened it and found a knob. And when she turned it, it divided into many flat diamonds with rituals on them and she said: ""Jinkies!"" Now, that's like Velma! And when she loses her classes, we all know what she is going to say: ""My glasses!!!"" Now that's a lot like Velma!! There was cute scene with the gang driving off somewhere in the mystery van and Scrappy-Doo , who is Scooby's nephew (Scott Innes). He says: ""Ta-da-da-da-da, Puppppy Powwer!!!"" And he peed. HA!HA!HA! Cute. And it seems, Scrappy wasn't a puppy, he was a dog with a gland disorder, which probably made him small , I guess.I dug that scene when Velma thought the monster she bumped into was a fantasy disguised villain, she tried to pull off it's mask and then, SURPRISE, SURPRISE!! MONSTERS DID EXIST!!! Hmm, those monsters were very well created with graphics and effects they had.Soon, Shag and Scoob noticed something was up with Fred, Velma Daphne and Mary Jane when they breathed out green gas and so did the rest of the people on the island. They were all possessed! And not so soon, Shaggy discovered a pool underground which contained every person's soul who was on the island. And when he found his friends' souls, they returned to their bodies one by one. There was a lot of comedy when this happened. Fred's soul got into Daphne's body and Daphne's soul got into Fred's body. And then, Fred said: ""Now, I can see myself naked in the mirror!"" Later on in the film, Scoob noticed there was something wrong with Mondavarious, he wanted Scoob to become a sacrifice. And underground, where all this sacrifice stuff was about to begin, the gang made a plan when the ""End of the World"" party was being celebrated with dance-like ceremonial melody for Scooby to become the sacrifice. And suddenly, a giant disco skull shot out of nowhere and it shone so brightly that it destroyed the monsters in every person's body. And the time came when the gang wanted to know who "" Mondavarious"" was, he was a robot controlled by Scrappy from the inside. That's really neat, for a small guy! Suddenly, Scrappy absorbed all the energy from the amulet and he turned into "" Scrappy Rex"" ( voice by J.P Manoux), he grabbed Scooby and then, Scooby attacked Scrappy's nose hairs and Scrappy sneezed. HA!HA! Scrappy Rex turned back into Scrappy- Doo!!! And, the real Mondavarious was discovered trapped under an underground trapdoor. He looked like he had been trapped in the ground for years! And the island was saved as all the souls returned to their bodies , Scrappy was arrested and the island was safe once again.",Scooby-Doo
127,amiranda-39274,Scooby doo in live action is amazing,8,26 August 2017,"This is my first review so i will try to do it as best as i can. but i have to warn you i will be bias, because this movie was my childhood, sure i had watched the cartoon before it, but i feel this really contributed to the show. Despite all the bad reviews this movie got, and i assume the ones it still gets, watch nostalgia critic's review on it, i still love this movie just as much as i did as a kid. the atmosphere is great i used to beg my parents to take me to spooky island as a kid, yeah i was a weird kid, but only because it looked real and amazing, a lot of detail went into the sets. i actually never found the plot too confusing, i followed it quite well, and the plot twist was awesome. I loved the characters, i think each actor portrayed their character really well, and dare i say perhaps even improved them. Matthew Lillard was exactly as shaggy should be portrayed in real life, wacky but reasonable, Velma was still smart, but more fleshed out, i would like to thank Linda Cardellini for that. Freddie prince Jr and Sarah Michelle Geller, really captured the chemistry of Daphne and Fred that i never got from the cartoon, in fact when my sisters found out these two got married in real life, they actually squealed. Also giving Daphne martial arts, Buffy like attitude, is what made Daphne more of an interesting character, in fact to this day they still give her this personality and skill set, and i know a lot of people hate CGI Scooby doo, but i didn't care i always believed there was an actual dog there, i think the actors also contributed to that. Isla fisher was a great addition, i was always sad she never showed up in other scooby doo movies,and johnny English is also in this movie. As much as i love this film, it still has flaws,i never liked the fart jokes, the adult jokes flew over my head as a kid, some are now more funny but some i still don't like.

Throughout the film, the actors never seem to decide whether or not they are taking the ridiculous plot and awful scripting seriously, and the result is terrible. If it happened to be done in a very tongue-in-cheek kind of way, this film could almost have tweaked a smile from me, but in the way it is portrayed it is uncomfortable for the audience as it seems for the actors.

However it still remains unfunny and charmless. Some good monster effects. But not really worth it. There is an audience for this, but it isn't children. It's for a more cynical bunch.

134,TelevisionJunkie,What were they thinking??,4,14 July 2002,"Hanna and Barbera are probably rolling in their graves. First of all, let me say that I'm a 25 year old guy (with bad taste) who's been a fan of Scooby Doo since I was born. I've anxiously been awaiting this film since Mike Myers began working on scripts for it years back. I wanna know what the hell happened to his scripts. Although I can't see him as Shaggy (Matt Lillard was perfect in the role), perhaps if they had stuck to Myers' script, the film would have been good instead of the PoS it turned out to be. I promised my sisters' kids I would take them to see it, but after some of the stuff I had heard, I wanted to preview it before taking them (I figured I'd wanna see it again anyway - boy was I wrong!). Turns out it was no worse than the kids' endless viewings of ""Dumb and Dumber"" on TBS, so I had to sit through this piece of crap twice....what a waste of 3 hours of my life.First of all, the good things about the film. Matthew Lillard was phenomenal as Shaggy - the movie's only saving grace. The woman who played Velma was also well-cast, though she didn't quite command the same presence Lillard has. Rowan Atkins also gives a good, but small, performance as the owner of the amusement park. The special FX ranged from excellent to abysmally computerized, though Scooby was better animated than I initially expected. And the scene in the castle was beautifully filmed, with a roller-coaster ride of good effects (and one of the only jokes I found amusing - about drinking out of the toilet). The only other joke that I found great amusement in (which flies over the heads of children) is a reference early on to Shaggy being the stoner that everyone's always assumed he is. That's about it for the good qualities, so on to the bad (which I could write a book about).I could say that Gellar and Prinze were miscast, but after two viewings, I don't think that was the problem. The problem was that they were both badly written/directed. Prinze's Freddy went from being the self-assured leader he was in the show to an ego-maniacal buffoon. Gellar's Daphne became far whinier and self-involved than the character ever was (with the exception of ""A Pup Named SD""), which made her far less sympathetic than she should have been. The addition of Scrappy to the cast was a forced and unfunny cop-out. The fact that he's probably the most hated cartoon character of all-time didn't justify using him the way they did (and I'm among his haters).The script is awful. Bad jokes sporadically thrown throughout the film, which were vulgar and tasteless, made me consider walking out the first time I saw it - and I've never considered walking out on any film I've seen, no matter how bad it was. The farting/belching/peeing scenes were what both audiences laughed most at, though for the life of me, I can't understand why. For them to go to such juvenile lengths to draw laughs, it should prove how bad the script was. And it's a sad commentary on America's sense of humor...the majority of people in both audiences appeared to be around my age.And then there was the profanity. Daphne utters a line about opening ""a can of whoop-ass."" Freddy says something about a ""byotch."" And the villain says he would've gotten away with it ""if it weren't for you meddling sons of..."" (at which point he's cut off). I use profanity every day of my life so I wasn't offended, but it had no place in this film (and the kids left reciting Daphne's line).The music is atrocious. With the exception of the David Newman score and around three songs (Simple Plan's ""Grow Up,"" Allstars' ""Bump in the Night,"" and MXPX's ""SD, Where Are You?"" cover) plus a clever cameo by Sugar Ray (who are far underused), the majority of the songs are insufferable rap songs. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against rap when you can understand what they're saying. But the rap songs here are garbled garbage. Where's Will Smith when you need him (doing the deplorable, almost-as-bad-as-this MIB II...)? Even the clever lyrics of Outkast's ""Land of a Million Drums"" (which plays over the end credits) can't justify the intolerable rapping. It also seems odd with their appearance in the film that Sugar Ray didn't write an original song, instead recycling a song off of a 9 month old album (though the song was probably new when they began filming, but still...).It's really sad that a generation of kids are being exposed to THIS variation of Scooby, rather than any of the classic cartoons - even Scooby and Scrappy-Doo (the most deplorable of all the series) was better than this. And it's sad that such a talented cast was wasted. It's sad that as a hardcore SD fan, I'd give this a two out of ten score (solely based on Shaggy and Velma's performances, otherwise it would be none out of ten). But the saddest thing of all is that they'll probably go on to do more sequels of this caliber...",Scooby-Doo

137,SwingBatta,Scooby Don't: Hollow cartoon adaptation goes to the dogs,4,30 July 2002,"Since the uninteresting Hanna-Barbera cartoon series ""Scooby-Doo"" managed to hang around television screens for over 30 years, it was apparently decidedat some point that it was a legitimate pop culture phenomenon and thus perfect summer-movie material. As a result, this inevitable feature-length incarnation of the eponymous Great Dane and his Mystery Inc. supporting cast has finally hit the big screen. Fred (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Velma (Linda Cardellini), and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) have suddenly split up after solving a case in a factory that manufactures Pamela Anderson dolls  insert your own joke  simply because Fred takes all the accolades for their accomplishments. However, they're instantly reunited after being summoned individually to the same destination: a haunted house-themed amusement park called Spooky Island. Requesting their services is park owner Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson), who has cause for alarm after discovering that someone, or something, is turning his college-age clientele into zombies. Disneyland, it's not.""Scooby-Doo,"" directed by Raja Gosnell, is an uninspired mongrel that proves Hollywood still hasn't learned from its past mistakes in converting half-hour cartoons to megaplex fodder, the recent flops ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" and ""Josie and the Pussycats"" notwithstanding. (Nor has it gotten the hint that Prinze and Lillard should not work together again following the debacle that was ""Wing Commander."") The inferiority of screenwriter James Gunn's lifeless mystery plot is clearly evident, it has to be camouflaged with a combination of inane dialogue, overuse of CGI, and a truly atrocious ending.The task at hand is so crucial that Scooby and Shaggy find time on the side for an abundance of pot jokes and a lengthy farting contest. Yes, a farting contest. If Mystery Inc. can regularly afford to partake in such nonsense in between solving crimes, then, by God, I want their jobs. There is also a fair amount of cleavage on display courtesy of nearly every female in the picture from the extras to our heroines. Oh boy, flatulence competitions, drug humor, and big breasts. Always the reliable staples of quality family entertainment. Things sure have changed in the course of three decades, haven't they?If there's anything positive that surfaces from this dreck, it's the fact that Lillard is dead-on with Shaggy's voice and goofy mannerisms. On the other hand, Prinze has the looks and charisma of a Ken doll as the egotistic Fred. Gellar and Cardellini portray whiny, two-dimensional personalities: Daphne continuously complains about being the damsel in distress while knocking out hulking bodybuilders, and Velma continuously acts jealous of Fred. It's a shame that Atkinson, who can easily act circles around this cast, receives less screen time than an insignificant voodoo master (Miguel A. Nunez, Jr., who's currently starring in another stinker, ""Juwanna Mann""). The filmmakers' only concern seemed to regard how good the cast looked on screen. There's no reason at all to care about any of these characters.However, the treatment of the human cast is a milquetoast in contrast to Scooby's role. Something is definitely amiss when the famous namesake of a summer blockbuster movie does little more than act as Shaggy's computer-animated armpiece while failing to believably blend in with any of his surroundings. The best example of a film combining cartoon characters with real-life environments remains ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" And that was 14 years ago.While immortalizing pop culture phenomena worked for ""Spider-Man,"" it doesn't even come close here. Just labeling ""Scooby-Doo"" a pop culture phenomenon is absurd. It doesn't take Mystery Inc. to decipher why this picture is such a disaster. But to those titillated by lousy storytelling coupled with unfunny pot and potty humor, this dud's for you. 3/10",Scooby-Doo
138,kippardue_luvr21,Not Much Like the TV Show,8,16 June 2002,"Though this movie did have it's highlights, it was nothing like the tv show. Shaggy and Scooby were like the only characters that remained the same. They totally changed the characters of Daphne, Velma, Fred and Scrappy Doo. However, it did have it's comedical points that made it funny for all ages. But, they changed a classic and brought a new Doo.",Scooby-Doo
139,Brian B-2,No reason to spoil the greatness of the cartoon,2,23 June 2002,"This movie is soooo bad, if it wasn't for the eye candy( SMG, Pammie, the gals that play Velma and Mary Jane), it would deserve a 1. Just when I thought it could descend no lower in stupid gross unfunny attempts at humour, it did.I expected better computer animation, but it looked phony. I guess we're spoiled.I disagree with the plaudits for Matthew Lillard's acting as Shaggy. I thought he was way over the top hammy.Freddie Prinze was wooden as Fred. SMG was fine as Daffy, although she is largely limited to an ornamental role in low cut short dresses. I wish I remembered the Velma gal's name- she steals the movie for me.I would watch her in a better movie.I also did not think it was true to the series. In the series, all the ""magic"" was explained as trickery. Not so here. Supernatural beliefs are so ingrained in Harry Potter, LOTR etc that the shabby voodoo here just slides by.Plus, I am far from a prude, but I thought the sex and drug references were a bit too explicit for the younger crowd.I did like the Harry Poter and the Chamber of Secrets trailer. Not worth $7.50 though.Send the kids. save your money for a real movie. Or stay home. maybe the Stooges are on TV, and they do fart jokes better. Or buy the Buffy DVD- season 2 was prime SMG- not so skinny they had to bury her in sweaters all the time.",Scooby-Doo
140,DaRick89,Overall this is a pile of 'Doo' - it's good qualities are swamped by its bad qualities,3,10 January 2006,"Let me start this review by saying that, even when I was younger, I never really got into Scooby-Doo. I felt that it was a one-dimensional cartoon, the plot and ending were recycled about a thousand times over and it felt so 60's-ish. Even taking this into account, 'Scooby-Doo' the movie is a piece of c***, created solely to bring in some cash, not because the studio concerned (Warner Brothers) wanted to at least try to make a good movie. This is clearly shown by the choice of director, cast, etc. There are a few redeeming qualities, but they are swamped by the wretchedness of the rest of the film.Anyway, on to the 'plot'. I put 'plot' in inverted commas because it is as flimsy as the plot for your average Scooby-Doo cartoon. You see, Fred takes all of the credit for the Scooby Gang's successes and Daphne's sick of being a 'damsel-in-distress' (more on this later), so the gang split up, leaving Shaggy and Scooby to languish over the mystery van. Two years later, they are reunited by Mondavrious, who is worried by teens attending his amusement park turning into zombies. Much derring-do occurs before the real villain is suddenly introduced and is (predictably) defeated. I don't feel at all guilty about spoiling the plot by the way, because there's precious little TO spoil.Now, as a point of interest, the setting and also, the CGI. I don't usually mention the setting of movies, but the setting of Scooby-Doo is notable for it's cheap, neon, garish tackiness. It is at it's worst in the amusement park, where the garish colours, horrendous-looking CGI creatures, bright lights and the tackiness of all and sundry will make you: a) fast forward b) become violently ill c) have an epileptic seizure. To sum up what the amusement park looks like, I'm just going to utter Marilyn Manson several times. While I'm on the subject of CGI, Scooby-Doo himself is horribly conceived and looks worse than the Scooby-Doo of lore.The acting is the best part of Scooby Doo, which is actually not saying that much. Linda Cardellini does a pretty good Velma, while Matthew Lillard has Shaggy's voice, look, facial expressions and personality down perfectly - even more praiseworthy considering that all he has to work with is a nonexistent CGI character. On the flipside, Freddie Prinze Jr., our washed-up one-dimensional pretty boy wannabe actor of the moment, screws up the role of Fred. I mean, how the hell do you screw up Fred?! He's MEANT to be bland and superficial! Truly remarkable. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, she looks hot as, that's for sure. Unfortunately, she misses Daphne's personality completely, instead preferring to act like Buffy. She even participates in a laughable catfight with several men, but that's more the fault of the script. Her turn as a damsel-in-distress is truly unbelievable, even more so if you know about her martial arts skills. Also, what the hell is Rowan Atkinson doing in this movie? He is kind of amusing, but then again, he's amusing in just about everything he's in.I'm going to load my conclusion with a list of Scooby clichés, which suits the movie and indeed, the entire franchise, since it is all so clichéd. So to sum up then, this is 'Scooby-Poo'. A note to the studio that released this mess: ""I would have been so much more content with life if it weren't for you meddling studio hacks."" I guess (or I hope) that you're thinking 'Scooby-Don't'. Zoinks! You know what? You're right. To milk more money out of the movie-going public, they released another one. Jinkies! Rhat Really Rucks! Like I said earlier, there are a few good qualities here, just that they are buried underneath all of the other 'Doo'.1.5/5 stars",Scooby-Doo
141,Go_Skins,Animated movie comes to life!,7,25 March 2005,My kids have this movie. I didn't think it would be good taking a movie that was a cartoon for many years and bringing it to life! It's a pretty decent movie with some pretty good acting! I liked Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne. I also liked Freddy Prinze Jr. as Freddy Jones. The story was about the gang that just finished yet another mystery. They all decide not to do any more mysteries together. We fast forward and see that they get invited to Mystery Island owned by Rowan Atkinson who is better known as Mr. Bean. I was very much into the story and enjoyed it from beginning to end! Definitely worth watching this one!,Scooby-Doo
142,mustican,Awww!!,1,29 December 2005,"Scooby-Doo is a kid's movie. It revolves around Scooby-Doo and his crime solving friends who work under the same umbrella of Mystery Inc. After choosing their own ways, they are invited to Spooky Island by its owner Emile Mondavarious(played by Rowan Atkinson). Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma team up to investigate the weird paranormal incidents in Spooky Island. The entire stuff is weird and beyond ridiculous. I wouldn't say that if it was a cartoon but seeing all those actors with that silly look and acting, I cant stop wishing that it was made as a cartoon rather than a movie. There is no cleavage in the making of the film. We don't know where it is going to but we don't care either. I think today's children are so clever that they wouldn't even enjoy it like their other average movies. All computer stuff used in the film is the fun of it. It is the only positive element of this movie but it is not enough to save Scobby-Doo. The viewers like me are disappointed to see Scobby-Doo like that and prefer to have it in its dusty shelf rather than in a pathetic, messy movie. A bad one. * out of *****",Scooby-Doo
143,nucksfan4life,Scooby's a hit on the big-screen,6,22 June 2002,"This movie works because it tries to mimic the cartoon in many ways. Even the first shot looks like the first shot of the cartoon with the fog and the creepy old house. I had originally thought that the CGI Scooby would bother me during the movie, but I was completely wrong. I only really thought about that the first time Scooby is shown. After that the dog was Scooby to me because the things he says and the way he says them are accurate to the cartoon. The movie is pure cheese, but so was the cartoon. ""Scooby-Doo"" has maybe the most effective farting scene since ""Blazing Saddles."" Most fart scenes just come off as gross and not very funny, but in the world of Scooby a fart scene works. One interesting aspect of the film was seeing Rowan Atkinson in a role where he actually talks...a lot! I hope he gets more chances at dialogue-heavy roles here in the States.  Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy all feel like their cartoon counterparts adding to the effectiveness of the movie. Lillard is amazing as Shaggy because he gets his voice to sound like a carbon-copy of the cartoon Shaggy. This is a fun movie to watch because you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the show.",Scooby-Doo
144,Dia Klain,Yet another Scooby Doo review,5,26 June 2002,"Scooby Doo, where are you? The little gang of mystery solvers has descended onto the big screen. Real and breathing except, that is, for the computer-generated dog. I shall quickly mention the old and new fans of this popular dated cartoon. I do not know how they felt about this movie; I am not one of them. I hate the cartoon for it is not only tersely repetitive but pointless, full of irritatingly repeating clishays and dreary old style animation, which I am NOT a fan of. I only spent money to see this movie out of the interest of how these characters were brought to life. That, and a passive interest in the actors Matthew Lillard and Sarah Michelle Gellar.
The Positive  Totally within the spirit of the animated Scooby Doo (I am reluctant to say I have watched the cartoon many a time), the characters, voices and actions, as well as those irritating memorable lines such as `like' or `Scooby Doo, where are you?' were readily repeated. The most amusing performance, or the one most to my liking, was Gellar as Velma. She gave a very intense feeling of a bitchy material girl which suites the actress quite well. One comment on her though, WHY WAS THE PURPLE SO DAMNED PINK?! Her clothes should have been more of a blue purple then a pink purple those idiots. Ahm. Right. Sorry but that just really got to me.
The Negative  Ok, no offence, I too am a computer freak, but the computer animation mixed with reality in supposedly `living' creatures is reeeeealy starting to get to me in the latest high budget movies. I am so proud of the latest Planet of the Apes for NOT putting computer graphics everywhere were makeup and costume get a little complicated. It looks stupid and ridiculous and just does not fit into the movie realistically. In conclusion, the movie was enjoyable, but breezy and thoughtless, which, after all, is what it should have been like.",Scooby-Doo

146,Grand,At least it has Matthew Lillard...,3,15 August 2002,"... but that is just about the ONLY good thing there is to say about this waste of a lot of talent.  Semi-spoiler warning(!!!):  If you were a fan of the TV series and stopped watching it because a certain new character was introduced for no apparent reason, under no circumstances should you spend any money to see this cinematic fiasco (although a fiasco of chianti and some fava beans might take your mind off of it if you DO see it, because you'll want to go Hannibal Lecter on those responsible for this ... thing).

Matt Lillard makes a great 'Shaggy' and Sarah Michelle Gellar is totally hot as 'Daphne', but Fred Prinze as 'Fred' and Linda Cardellini as 'Velma' both suck.

148,blade-21,Nostalgic Romp.,7,21 July 2002,"This is an excellent nostalgic romp of a film. It captures the feel of the cartoon version with just a few differences. (e.g. The initial splitting up of the gang - such disagreements never surfaced in the film). The storyline isn't too bad either although it has an actual ""supernatural"" foundation rather than ""Mr Smith in a mask"".From a purely nostalgic point of view I was very sorry to see the briefish appearance of Scrappy Doo towards the end. I think that he spoilt the cartoon version. Part of Scoobys charm is his ill formed English. If a dog could talk that is how it should be. However, Scrappy is too articulate and ruins the show. keep scrappy out.",Scooby-Doo
149,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 2 out of 5,3,7 July 2003,"Scooby-Doo is mercifully short - at only 83 minutes - which is probably the best thing that can be said about it.  Whatever the director and producers were trying to achieve by bringing Hanna-Barbera's classic cartoon to life, it's fairly safe to say they failed.  Despite excellent character interpretations by Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini as Shaggy and Velma, the fleshing out of the Mystery Inc. team is disappointingly shallow.  As is the irritating mission of self-discovery and angst each character goes through before discovering that (surprise, surprise) teamwork is best.The film could be forgiven many of its foibles if only it was rib-ticklingly hilarious.  Unfortunately it suffers from trying to cater both to a young audience, and also to adults who fondly remember the cartoon from their childhood days.  Rowan Atkinson is cringingly unfunny as the strange proprietor of Spooky Island amusement park, and surely even kids are by now impervious to fart and snot jokes.  However, the sequence inside the spooky abandoned castle raises a few hearty chuckles.The trademark unlikeliness of the situations Mystery Inc. got themselves into in the cartoon doesn't transfer well into realism.  The plot, which has a number of large holes, concerns the mysterious change in behaviour of college students who are holidaying at the resort of Spooky Island.  And, it has to be admitted, that thanks to some great sets and the wonders of CGI, the resort looks like a pretty cool place to spend a vacation.  The construction of the theme park has awakened some ancient (and quite scary, considering the PG-rating) monsters, so it's up to the team to unmask the villain and save the world.  But the best way of saving yourself is to avoid watching this movie.",Scooby-Doo
150,TheFilmConnoisseur,Scooby-Why? (Will Contain Spoilers),5,18 June 2003,"****Excellent***Good**Fair*PoorI've always been a big fan of the Scooby-Doo cartoon series so when it was announced that he would make the leap to the big screen I was excited. However, once I saw the finished product I left the theaters with a tear in my eyes.Director Raja Gosnell destroyed a very simple concept. I enjoyed the fact that they made reference to all the different series but they should have stuck with the main concept: making adults and children laugh at the same time for two different reasons.The film rarely had any hidden jokes. The humor that was available was very lame and the plot itself had potential but the lack of humor and faithfulness to the television series was not there.Freddie Prince, Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar were horribly miscast while Matthew Lillard and the beautiful Linda Cardellini did a wonderful performance as Shaggy and Velma. Too bad the film wasn't as good as there performance.The only good decision made for this film was making Scrappy the villian. And having him urinate on Sarah Michelle Gellar. In addition I have to agree that they atleast managed to entertain the children. Which is a good thing so soon after 9/11.RATING: 1 STAR",Scooby-Doo
151,droogiedim77,Don't Even Bother.....I Warned You,2,8 June 2002,"I am so disappointed in this movie I can't even put it into words. This is just a terrible, terrible movie. It isn't as bad as Changing Lanes, but it could give it a run for it's money. If not for my love the Scooby-Doo cartoon, I would have walked out after about 30 minutes. And I have never walked out of a movie in my life. The only other movie i was ever tempted to walk out of was Changing Lanes. This movie has what I like to call ""Street Fighter Syndrome."" What is Street Fighter Syndrome, you ask? I'll tell you. Street Fighter Syndrome is when developing a film of a popular staple of pop-culture and you take the time to cast people who look perfect as the characters, but don't give any thought at all to things such as plot, a good script, good directing and all that other unimportant stuff. (sarcasm) There are barely a handful of good things about this movie. The first 5 minutes are good, but it takes a nosedive soon after. Matthew Lilliard, Linda Cardellini, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and even Freddie Prinze Jr. are all good as Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred. The CG Scooby is even pretty impressive. Sarah Michelle Gellar looks very hot as Daphne. Even Velma is hot. Other than that, this movie has no possible redeeming values. The plot seems like it was written by Shaggy himself. You might like this if YOU'VE NEVER SEEN AN EPISODE OF THE CARTOON, you are a little kid, or you are like Shaggy himself. (""Mary Jane is like my favorite name of all time."" A direct quote from the movie. I AM NOT LYING.) But if you were like me, someone who had high hopes after many hours spent watching the cartoons, I hate to burst your bubble. If you want to see a good, funny movie go see Undercover Brother.",Scooby-Doo
152,hippiegal,Cute and fun movie,9,20 June 2002,"Okay I really, really liked this movie. But I am a cartoon fanatic so that must be put in mind. I felt the movie for the most part captured the feeling of the original episodes of the show. It was creepy in a silly way that kids enjoy. The movie overall is entertaining and is much better than I figured it would be. But let's be honest, even though Scooby-Doo is amazing popular it's always been a guilty pleasure for many people. So keeping the movie with a tongue-in-check feeling made it work well. I thought the special effects were well done. Matthew Lillard was perfect casting as Shaggy. He was born to play the part. Linda Cordellini was also great as Velma. Growing up almost every girl I knew worshiped Velma because she was one of the only girls on TV(live action or cartoon)- who looked like a real female. She stays very faithful to the character which I'm grateful. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Geller I don't know about. I felt the could have been more faithful to the characters. Freddie Prinze LOOKS like Fred, but anyway. Overall a cute movie. Almost all the kids at the screening left the theater saying nothing but wonderful things about the movie. Which since the movie aimed at kids means more about it reaching it's target audience than movie critics feeling's on it. Fun, fun movie for kids and cartoon nuts who are kids at heart.P.S. The monsters were cool.",Scooby-Doo
153,Fenris Fil,Just plain Awful,3,2 August 2002,"I was warned this film was disappointing, but nothing could really prepare me for how bad it was. Simply put this just could have been a lot better (and I am a fan of the cartoon too).Firstly it seems to be designed from a very narrow standpoint. People that loved the normal crew but hated Scrappy Doo may be just about catered for. However I can't help but feel the only characters accurate to the TV series was Scooby and Shaggy. I personally would have much rather seen the film simply about those two but they decided to include all the others, including Scrappy who is made a humiliating joke of on several occasions rather then being included in the crew. If the makers really hated the Scrappy cartoons (I seem to remember them being pretty successful at the time so obviously not everyone agrees with them) they should have just forgotten about him. If I had done this I would have happily forgotten about all but Shaggy and Scooby.While Scrappy is made to look pathetic, the other characters comical flaws are somewhat ironed out. Daphne has learnt to do martial arts (no surprise with her being played by Sarah ""Buffy"" Michelle Gellar), Velma is far less plain then she should be (putting stupid glasses on a really attractive woman is a very poor movie cliché that never worked). Fred actually comes out even more cardboard then in the cartoons. However he does suddenly become an adept combatant with a chain near the end, which seems somewhat out of character.The film seems undecided about how much is realism and how much is cartoon style. Switching from parody of cartoon events to attempts at originality and back like you're watching two different movies and switching channels. The soundtrack is also similarly confused, sounding like an awkward cartoon parody at some points and virtually empty at others. The plot is predictable, as are the jokes (and they are pretty slow to come too). Even the special effects are poor and unimaginative.The plot...well the less said about that the better. You can see what they've tried to do with it, and frankly that was a bad idea to start with. It's a bad idea done badly. The plot holes would be forgivable in this kind of movie were it not for all the other flaws. The attempts to inflict Hollywood morality (The ""perfect"" people are totally perfect and the ""freaks"" should be ridiculed and laughed at) ruins most of what could have been good. All that is left are the two elements that were central and safe from being messed with: Scooby and Shaggy.Of the cast the only one I could say did a good performance is Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. Sarah Michelle Gellar did pretty well too, but her character was ruined by the scripts and she was given way too much screen time for the character (obviously she was going to be a big draw, so you can see why they did that, the same with the kick boxing).
If you want to see this kind of film, but done well I'd recommend the newAustin Powers movie. True it's less of a family movie, but its pretty close in style to Scooby Doo, the only difference being that you will probably enjoy Austin Powers even if you find it somewhat disposable. If you want to see a modern parody of Scooby Doo (with no Scrappy at all btw) I'd suggest downloading the special the cartoon network did called ""The Scooby Doo project"".Unfortunately this is the kind of film most people will see regardless of what others say simply for curiosity (that's why I'm here). So unfortunately a sequel is highly likely. But you never know, if they just keep it with Scooby and Shaggy it could be very good. The odd brief moment of the two of them in this film showed an amount of promise.",Scooby-Doo
154,d-snake1,Only watch it if it comes on TV. Sub par all around and nothing compared to the show.,4,20 August 2017,"It's about what I'd expect. It's silly and cheesy, and as such, only watch if you don't want to take it seriously. There are extended fart jokes and 'teen slang' jokes. Sometimes these can be funny, but this movie handles them in a lazy way. Freddie Prinze is a miscast, but Lillard, Cardellini, Atkinson, and Gellar all work or excel as their characters. The writing is sub par, the story is disjointed, and the characters feel watered down.

156,wile_E2005,"Pretty interesting, actually...",7,10 August 2005,"This might have a few minor spoilers.Now, I am a fan of the CLASSIC Scooby-Doo cartoons, so when my parents rented this on video to see with their friends, I decided to check it out.First of all, they have a good cast for the Mystery Inc. gang. (They used to be called the ""Scooby-Doo Detective Agency,"" by the way.) Matthew Lillard's Shaggy is pretty good... at some parts you might think it's actually Casey Kasem playing the famous cartoon beatnik! Also, Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a sexy Daphne, too! The CGI Scooby... well, he is all right, I suppose. He does act like the cartoon Scooby, and he is kinda cute, but I think the cartoon Scooby is cuter and funnier. The voice Scooby has in this is pretty poor-sounding, and it is no match for Don Messick's classic Scooby doggie voice.Also, the plot is slightly interesting. They do have a few references to the classic Scooby cartoons, such as using some of the old Hanna-Barbera sound effects (like the bongo sound before Scooby takes off) mixed with the standard sound effects you hear on most recent live-action WB feature films, and Fred has his ascot, too. Also, they do have songs playing during the old chases against the villains, but for the ultimate chase, they use a rock version of the Scooby-Doo theme! Ironic, huh? Also, I find this a lot like a live-action version of Warner Bros. Animation's incarnations of the Scooby cartoons (Zombie Island, What's New Scooby, etc.) Also, there are SOME real monsters in it, too. And, of course... SCRAPPY-DOO is in it! He even actually PEES on Daphne! But thankfully Scrappy isn't in it much. I advise those Scrappy-Doo fans out there to NOT watch this film! Overall, a good film and you should check it out.",Scooby-Doo

160,zaidmnomani,So Dumb It's Funny,4,3 July 2020,"So last week I was scrolling through Netflix because I had nothing to watch, and came across this movie. I've always been a fan of the Scooby-Do show and decided to give this film a watch. And oh boy, I'm glad I did. This is one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen. That doesn't mean it's any good though.
Now I would like to point out that this film does have a level of self-awareness to it, so maybe it's just stupid on purpose. But still, there's a lot to complain about.The acting is on the level of a high school play. And that's not an exaggeration. Velma's actress in particular is shockingly bad. But don't worry, every other actor displays some terrible acting as well. It's more excusable when the characters are being goofy and silly, but when the movie gets serious and the characters are trying to have a have an emotional moment, it's laughably bad. None of the actors have any chemistry at all and they're at their best when alone or in groups of two, which kind of defeats the purpose of the whole 'teamwork' message this film has.In the first five minutes the characters split up and the Mystery Inc. is no more. The problem with this is that we have been given no reason to actually care that they split up. And then they come back and have to learn to work together. We should have had more scenes with the main characters before they broke apart, so that we could understand more about these people. Heck, they're the main characters.Speaking of which, all the members of Mystery Inc. are flat and one-dimensional. Everyone has two personality traits and that's it. Fred is the leader who always takes all the credit for the teamwork. Velma is the smart girl who feels unappreciated. Daphne is the damsel in distress who hates being the damsel in distress. As for Shaggy and Scooby, well um... they're really dumb and try to be funny (emphasis on try).Which brings me to my next point: the comedy. I am of the opinion that a person can make a kids movie and it can still be enjoyed by adults. The best kids films are the ones that can be enjoyed by more than just kids. But any hope of adults enjoying this film was destroyed when it comes to the comedy. You know the writers did not put any effort in the jokes when there is a three minute long sequence involving a burping contest. Later on the characters have all their brains swapped, and for five minutes the characters are joking about their situation and examining themselves. Not only are the jokes terrible, but they also drag down the runtime of the film significantly. The only times that I actually laughed were due to how ridiculous the plot become.That is, of course, if you can even call the film's narrative a plot. I saw every story beat and twist coming from a mile away. The villain twist was super obvious, as was the MJ is evil twist. I'll admit, there were some thing that I didn't expect, but only because they were so bizarre and stupid. The whole point of the scooby-do cartoon is that whenever it looks like there is some supernatural ghost, zombie, mummy or whatever, there is always a perfectly realistic and reasonable explanation for it. But the film takes the lazy route and instead just says: oh yeah, magic exists. This undermines the whole concept of the original show completely.To be fair, most of what I have to say for this movie is true in the show as well. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot twists are always predictable (the least predictable character is always the culprit) and the jokes were pretty bad. Still, the show was at least slightly more clever than this movie. But if you want to watch, do so with a bunch of friends. You'll be very, very entertained.",Scooby-Doo

I grew up on the original cartoon, so you can imagine how a seven-year-old would feel when he sees his favorite cartoon in live-action.Revisiting this one 15 years later was interesting, because on one hand - this is a children's film that isn't really that great. On the other hand, my nostalgia for the character and my ability to notice some more of the nuanced adult jokes kept me from hating it.There are many times where you can definitely tell that this is a product from the early 2000's and some of the jokes just aren't nearly as funny as I remember them being. The plot felt different than an ordinary Scooby-Doo cartoon, but it still had that Scooby-Doo charm to it.There was a twist-ending which I still don't quit understand, but it exists and it's not too terribly executed.If you ever loved the original Scooby-Doo, you might be able to enjoy this film.

165,Lary9,Pass the Scooby-snacks and the espresso! I'm nodding...,2,17 June 2002,"I have seen too many ""Scooby-Doo"" episodes on TV, (although under coercion from a sadistic pre-schooler who routinely threatens to whine at me with extreme prejudice if I don't recant and pass the remote), and I confess that I just don't get it.  I don't even get the ""Scooby Goes Hollywood"" where old 60s & 70s celebrities appear as cartoon caricatures of themselves; just plain-famous folks caught in another impossibly dull Scooby-Shaggy episode against assorted pseudo-monsters.  But, my 6-year-old loves it!  He doesn't care an iota if Kurosawa didn't direct it! Now, a few asides are needed here I have been to Universal Studios, Florida and applauded Doug Funny and `The Rugrats!' on stage.  I actually went to a `Barney the Dinosaur' live concert and howled like a teenage ""In Sync"" fan when Old Barn came rolling out with his purple pot belly in gleeful kinesis! I have even enthusiastically interacted with Steve & Blue for clues but this `Scooby-Doo' thing lacks anything remotely redeemable.  I loathe the show's time slotI become perceptibly stressed with hives before `Scooby-Doo' marathons on the Cartoon Channel, usually a Sunday event, which inevitably conflicts with Yankee-Red Sox games.  The social relations among the Scooby' Five, not to be confused with the Scottsboro 5, are void of any allegory or depth.  The dog and his cohorts are rendered in a flat, two-dimensional graphic style reminiscent of `Steamboat Willie.'  The animation is without depth or perspective, and the characters move around on perfectly still budget-friendly backgroundsyech! The characters (Shaggy, Daphne, Velma and Fred) bring matching personas to their screen presence. And, Scooby has apparently evaded the evolutionary lottery of natural selection, which mandates that a palette, tongue and convoluted cerebral cortex are required for language acquisition!  Scooby speaks, inexplicably, in limited English but with an annoying & incomprehensible `r-r-r-r-u-f-f' sound prefixing every utterance. Of course, only Shaggy and my son can understand this coded canine verbal-slaw. OKso I get the Scooby-thingit's pure silly nonsense played for yucks!  I get the Scooby Snack-thingthe dog is always hungry!  I even accept that Scooby must never hump the guest star's leg, although my son occasionally springs a pre-school woody for Daphne Blakecertainly a fertile topic for father-son dialogues about the male 'willy' and its various purposes. Regardless of this concealed erotic bonus feature, it still is an all time low achievement from the predictably banal imaginations of Hanna & Barbera. You will recall that they were also the creators of'The Flintstones', another one-trick-pony', flat animation series with the effect of a `pie-in-the-face' to any National Hope in growing a generation prepared to catch the Japanese in math & science! (Certainly, paleontology has a slight chance here from the splash benefits of the current cultural swell of 'dinophilia'.  Also, a note here of apology to `Jay', my sushi-guru who won't even whisper his true Sino-nymn' for fear that I will lingually disfigure it Jay, buddy, I know you guys have limited access to archeological digs around Osaka, et.al.  Nothing personal.  I don't even hold Hondas & `Dragonball Z' against you guys! OK?  Keep that great California Roll' coming...it's pure art.) But, Lord!  Deliver us from the purveyors of the bland, vacuous cartoon series that repeats and repeats and repeatsthen mercifully diesand resurrects 10 years later on 24-hour cable TV!  (I'm praying that a round the clock `Scooby-Doo Network' does not rise up from the ashes!) But, wait! There's more!  This fetid, animated pabulum is miraculously resuscitated at the brink of expiration as a full-length feature film intended to collect the box office proceeds that should've been paid originally to a hired assassin to put the whole dreary project team asleep'humanely. Oh well. I could be wrong.  Maybe `Scooby-Doo' is really the charming, diverting visual poem that my son assures me that it istwice daily... and twice that again on Sunday.

168,The Overdrama,Heed the Words of a False Prophet.? (possible spoiler),8,23 June 2002,"I take adaptations of classic comics & other cartoons religiously. With so many bad adaptations like Inspector Gadget, Batman & Robin, and, to some extent, X-Men, I had begun to lose my faith. Hearing Mike Myers was taking on Scooby rekindled a spark in me a bit, but upon hearing of the current cast, I once again became skeptical.Spider-Man became my messiah - at last an adaptation worth praising. Then, Scooby starting surprising me: hearing Matthew Lillard do Shaggy was an epiphany - perhaps Raja Gosnell did indeed know what he was doing.Still being somewhat skeptical, I went to see Scooby. I was absolutely thrilled, despite minor disappointing quirks from supposedly static characters(like Fred's heretofore unseen vanity and Daphne's whine). I actually enjoyed the movie.Reference to Hong Kong Phooey and the gang ditching Scrappy (too bad Lucas didn't do similarly with Jar Jar) were delightful. ""Brick House"" as theme music to Scooby's disguise helped set the ""updatedness"" of the movie back to the '70's in a refreshing way.But alas, the story was revealed to be a false prophet upon reaching the climax. My placation went from 99% to 10% when the real villain was revealed. Even my 10-year old brother was insulted by the poor choice of antagonism. I won't say who that villain was, so as to not spoil much, but I will say that our favorite ol' Great Dane didn't have him crying ""Uncle.""The Overdrama
P.S. - Sarah Michelle Gellar is one of my favorite actresses, but portraying Daphne was no help to her poor resume. And, after seeing the movie, she had me salivating no where near as much as Isla Fisher, who potrays Mary Jane (à la Spidey?), Shaggy's gorgeous girlfriend.",Scooby-Doo

Believe it or not, we all had a good time and weren't disappointed!  It made for a fun afternoon at the theater for mom and her 15 and 12 year old. It's colorful, entertaining and just plain fun. I'm not going to dissect every character, but I did think Shaggy and Scooby stole the show.  They were adorable together, and I don't know what those critics are talking about who say Scooby Doo's animation stinks.  The movie was WAY better than Attack of the Clones (snore), but not as good as Spider Man, if you're in the market for a family film. 8/10",Scooby-Doo
170,pywrit,"Crude, Campy, & Funny",7,26 October 2002,"When I sat down to watch this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I had heard so many people say it sucks, and so many others say it was a riot. After reviews like that and having seen every episode of Scooby up until the point that Scrappy made his presence known, I had to see it for myself. While there are plenty of slow spots, there are some outright funny parts. The flatulence contest, while very crude, definitely appealed to my less mature side.  I was just about rolling on the floor howling.  And what can you say when smoke is rolling out of The Mystery Machine and Matt Lillard as Shaggy (as one reviewer perfectly put it, it is as if he was genetically created to play this part) while grilling some bread shouts ""Talk about toasted!""  One would have to be very dimwitted to have missed this reference and not laughed (excepting the prude of the bunch).  I really think Sarah Michelle should have been given large, flowing, red hair like the cartoon Daphne, and FP Jr. just doesn't have the build to quite pull off Freddie completely.  Linda Cardellini as Velma, however, if perfectly cast and plays the part perfectly (not to mention she's far prettier than SMG).  This movie combines plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor amongst a plethora of sight gags that makes it work overall, despite the shortcomings in casting.  The CG Scooby I think works quite well as making the Great Dane look real might have made it just a little too difficult to suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy the movie at all.  James Gunn, screenwriter and co-writer of the original story and a good SF writer, does an adequate job at this, though I think parts of his humor fall just a bit flat.  All-in-All, on the pywrit scale of 1-10, this one gets a 7.  Not perfect, but ultimately watchable and enjoyable with plenty of good, gut-busting laughs. And an ""oh yeah.""

172,Ziman,Good at reviving the essence of the TV Series.,5,13 July 2002,"There seems to be a genre out there that's been stirring the past several years, and we are beginning to see more and more of it.  It is one that has decided to take a classic TV-series (animated or otherwise) and resurrect it into a modern motion picture.  All-in-all this isn't a horribly bad concept, if the conversion is done to preserve the style and format of the original, or to take it and improve on it where needed.  `Scooby Doo' is one such creation.  There is plenty that is flawed with this movie but let's remember, it's based on a late 60s (and early 70s) animated series aimed at children.  The series was plagued with it's own predictability and seemingly stenciled format that mirrored itself in every episode.  Of course, the film is no different.  But that's one of the things that I like about it.  In fact, there seems to be some intent at pointing out this predictability in the movie itself.As a conversion, they producers and writers did a very good job lifting from the animated series, the format, and structure of the original.  Even exemplifying the character attitudes and pre-conceived notions we have of them.  Without speaking to them, I believe this is what they had in mind, and if so, they did an excellent job.  The costumes were well done, some of the action is cartoon-ish (in a good way), and the attitudes that would have been stirring in the characters the past 30-some years come to life here.I do have to comment as well that Matthew Lillard is absolutely FLAWLESS as Shaggy.  In fact, he does so well, there are times you swear that the voice you are hearing is the original Casey Kasem from the original series (for those that remember it anyway).As I mentioned, there is plenty that is flawed with this movie (hence the 2-star rating) but it's nothing to get all worked up over.  And I won't get in to it in this review. If you care to find out, simply read many of the other reviews out there. I especially didn't like how the movie ended, but I'll admit at least that it was something that I wasn't expecting.  Lest we forget that `Scooby Doo' is a vessel for entertaining children, even those who have never seen the series  And from what I understand, it does a fine job of doing that.   There definitely is a kid-style humour throughout.If you're an adult, and you enjoyed the series when you were younger, this movie may also be for you.  As I've mentioned, it's a direct conversion of an animated series, to the live-action and a good conversion preserving what you might expect from a `Scooby Doo' episode.  There are a few jokes for the adults in the crowd too, including some VERY subtle humour regarding Shaggy's less-than-obvious recreational pastimes (you can about guess).I wouldn't recommend paying premium prices for this flick, but if you get to go with a movie-pass, or have kids to take to a movie this isn't a bad option.",Scooby-Doo

174,jason06-1,Underrated,10,5 April 2007,"Scooby-Doo is a worthy live action film to a brilliant original T.V. showPlot: The Mystery Inc. gang have split up and are each off on their own, only Scooby-Doo (Voice of Neil Fanning) and Shaggy (Matthew Lilard) remain together and they own the Mystery Machine. They are called back into action when a strange man shows up and invites them to Spooky Island to solve a mystery. They are convinced when he mentions an all you can eat buffet and are on their way to the airport. There they run into the rest of the gang, Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Velma (Linda Cardellini), and Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Still resenting each other they refuse contact and once on the island they meet the owner, Emile Mondavariours (Rowan Atkinson) who informs them of the problem. He believes that somebody is casting a spell on the visitors who come to his resort. Starting off on looking for clues by themselves the gang realizes after a attack that they need to put their differences aside and team up if they ever want to solve the mystery.The Good News: This being the motion picture film to a T.V. series that spawned thousands of imitators it had a lot to live up to and it delivers. Since it was released people have bashed this film to pieces, but if you take a minutes and look at it closely it is a pretty underrated film. The actors all do an outstanding job at bringing the gang to life. At first glance Freddie Prinze Jr. may seem like the wrong choice, but he fills Fred's shoes amazingly well with adequate skill. Linda Cardellini portrays the brainy smart Velma we all know, but Linda plays her with a sensitive side which is new and a a nice choice. Sharah Michelle Gellar is the shining light here bringing warmth and believability to her character as Daphne, everyones favorite danger prone female who proves she is tougher than most think in one of the film's best scenes. Matthew Lillard plays Shaggy well and plays off of Scooby-Doo well even though there was nothing there during filming. Lillard's acting is a key success to the film. It doesn't matter how well the CGI Scooby is made Lillard really has to bring it to life by make believing that Scooby is actually there. The whole thing could have gone completely wrong, but luckily this escapes that. Now the question that most people are asking. How does Scooby-Doo stack up? Neil Fanning's has to be the best since the original and the CGI Scooby looks pretty convincing. The action is a big part of this film as it plays a huge part. There are plenty of action scenes to keep you interested. My favorite one probably has to be the castle scene, a ten minute romp where the gang uncovers clues and it all ends in a big bang, but there are many more to more than fulfill your attention. The screenplay keeps thing's nice and simple and so is the direction. Constant and flashy cuts would've gotten in the way here so the direction they took works the best. The film all ends with more action scenes, big bangs, and many great twists. This could've been a lot worse.The Bad News: The could've taken out the crude humor, but that's my only complaintConclusion: See this at any cost if you are a hardcore Scooby-Doo fan and others will all so want to check this out.

178,scgary66,The sum of all (cartoon) fears,2,17 June 2002,"In a movie that makes Casper look like Chinatown by comparison, there is very little I can think to say other than this might be the most horrifying (in a bad way) kids' movie ever made. The movie combines all the worst qualities of not only Casper, but also Inspector Gadget (the stunningly base commercialism) and, yes, Howard the Duck. Am I the only one who can't help seeing the similarities here? A human-like, talking animal hero helps his friends save the world from invading monsters.... I thought of old Howard instantly the first time I set eyes on these CGI beasties. There's even  a stunningly misplaced rock concert scene - with Sugar Ray's Mark McGrath lip-synching horribly. (Though I suppose we should be grateful for small favors in that McGrath isn't singing with Scooby.)This movie, stopping in theaters on its way from the cartoon screen to a Six Flags near you, is astonishingly crass in how every scene seems designed solely for the purpose of creating a theme-park attraction: the obligatory stunt show (with personal 4-wheel mini dune buggys), the theme restaurant, the beach resort area, the horror-themed amusement park rides (I stopped counting how many different rides were momentarily shown), the nightclub with demon-head disco ball, etc. In truth, the ""sets"" looked precisely like they were designed to be easily and perfectly (not to mention cheaply) replicated for live attractions. And I couldn't help thinking that the main reason the effects weren't better (they really are not very good) is that good effects would be harder to convert to live shows.As for the ""plot,"" anyone who can't identify the real villain (and I don't mean the filmmakers, thought that's true too) by the end of his first scene isn't trying very hard. And for a supposed kids' movie, it's hard to find a scene that doesn't seem to strain itself trying to add something that's decidedly NOT for kids under 10. I tried to think of the last movie rated under PG-13 that was this bad; it's EASILY sub-Grinch (that movie, for all its faults, had at least a much more substantial level of craftsmanship going for it); Inspector Gadget is probably the last PG movie I could think of that sunk to this level. Rowan Atkinson is in this movie for no particular reason; his abilities aren't remotely hinted at, and ten thousand actors could have each given an identical performance.The theater where I saw this was populated mostly with kids under 8 and their parents; if the adults hadn't been restraining the kids from running around, I doubt that the movie could have held their attention very long. (And the occasional crying from smaller kids was hard to miss.)I felt like I'd been trapped in a Chuck E. Cheese run by Stalin. For what it's worth, only the efforts of Lillard and, to a lesser extent, Cardellini keep this movie from being a rock-bottom 1 - which I reserve for only the worst movie or two of the year.2 of 10",Scooby-Doo

Being a 38 year old male, I was in the prime age group of Scooby-Doo (the cartoon) when it began in the 60s.Scooby was my favorite cartoon.  Why?  Because Scooby was so cool.  He was funny; I laughed my head off.So when I saw Scooby-Doo (the movie) last night, I laughed hard and loud! There were kids all around me looking at me as if I was nuts!  But Scooby was Scooby.  That's who I grew up with and that's who I loved in the movie!Why only 3 stars instead of 4? Why only 7 out of 10?Three things about the movie bothered me: 1)The fact that the 'meddling kids' were doing so much fighting amongst themselves, 2)Shaggy and Velma had love interest (why does Hollywood insist everyone have a boyfriend or girlfriend?), and 3)the villain was such a disappointment.  Many familiar with the original cartoon hated the character, and as a villain in this movie - it made matters worse.If not for those three things, the movie would have played just like a standard 30 minutes episode with every silly hilarious cliche.So the big rotund movie critic who sits in a balcony blasted this movie saying that ""myself..., even at a very young age, [discovered]that the world was filled with entertainment choices more stimulating than ""Scooby-Doo.""What arrogance!He was right in saying that if you aren't familiar with Scooby-Doo you wont get the joke.  Very true.  But to insult people who did grow up with Scooby-Doo?He also wrote (after blasting the movie) ""I did like the dog. Scooby-Doo so thoroughly upstages the live actors that I cannot understand why Warner Bros. didn't just go ahead and make the whole movie animated.""Duh!!!!  The dog IS the movie and everyone else is support!!! Also, why make it animated when that's what's on the Cartoon Network every day?!?!?!Critics are pompous.  If you love Scooby-Doo - this is a fun movie!",Scooby-Doo
180,dsl3001,walked out in about half an hour,7,1 February 2007,"I'd have to say I didn't like this movie as much as the Aardman films. though it was OK in certain ways.I watched SCOOBY-DOO when I was only five years old.Even though I am a kid I am completely a computer geek I like looking at things about filmmakers,and I have been making IMDb reviews ever since THE MORPH FILES.Though I walked out after about half an hour of the movie probably because I was to young.I completely blamed my parents for making me watch SCOOBY-DOO.though 3 years later I watched it again and I wasn't scared because I was 8 years old though some parts were definitely weird which is why I didn't like it as much as the Aardman films.so if you are looking for good ghost movies this probably isn't the movie for you.If you are looking for good ghost movies I would much prefer movies such as CASPER or GHOSTBUSTERS.",Scooby-Doo
181,antidonnie,Just About As Bad As It Gets,2,30 March 2006,"""Zoinks""This was a horrible, HORRIBLE film that literally makes me ill just thinking about it. Raja Gosnell is all the way unworthy of being called a filmmaker, and ever since he took on the job of disrespecting the classic Your, Mine and Ours, which was a childhood favorite, he was personally put on my hit-man list. Scoobys poor animation only makes everything worse. The humor wasn't funny, It was crude, childish, immature, and far off from respect of the original cartoon. I wasn't a big fan of it from the beginning, but even I had more respect for the series than this movie did.Anyone notice that throughout the film there's this certain chemistry between Fred and Velma. So I thought, that's weird, I always thought Fred and Daphne had a thing going for them. Then, without a second to spare, the whole romantic chemistry blew up in my face. At the end Fred went with Daphne, and Velma went to some loser that doesn't matter. OK, what's up with that, honestly?That was my first biggest problem. My number one reason for despising this flick is a little pup named Scrappy. I've seen a couple of episodes with this son of a devil dog. I hated him, always have hated him, and always will HATE him! I thought surely they wouldn't be dumb enough to bring him into the story. Sure enough, they did, and from then on this became on of my most hated movies of all time.The only credit I give to this film is that the leading actors did a good job with their characters, specially Shaggy.1/2/**** starsScooby-Doo (2002): Rated PG for rude humor, some language and scary images",Scooby-Doo

183,kurtman-3,Just plain fun!,8,15 June 2002,"The movie is not a masterpiece and it never was meant to.  It is just plain fun.  I grew up on Scooby-Doo and the movie does just as good a job of entertaining as the cartoon. The plot isn't that important. All you need is a fairly impossible mystery, and an villain that could never have really pulled it off. For people who hated Scrappy this is the best way possible for him to appear in the movie.  The characters were well played accept Fred.  Freddie Prinze Jr. just wasn't right for the part.  When you get out of theater you will have had a good time and that's it. No serious revelation to think deeply about just a good film for kids and other scooby fans.",Scooby-Doo
184,TribalWarriorPrincess,Not bad,7,30 December 2006,"This is a pretty good movie. Sure it's goofy and freaky in some parts, but it's not stupid like some other movies (coughSCARYMOVIEcough). I think the actors they got to play the Mystery Inc. gang matched their characters personalities very well, especially the actors playing Shaggy and Scooby. It was very funny when Fred and Daphne were in each other's bodies and the Daemen Ritus (is that how you spell it?) kept switching everyone's protoplasm around. It was also pretty cool when Daphne, the one who always ends up the damsel in distress, was fighting, and beat, the masked wrestler. She's actually the one who ended up saving the day, if you really look at it. And Scrappy as a villain? I didn't even think that was possible. Well done guys, well done.",Scooby-Doo
185,JCX94,Totally Groovy Dude,10,17 May 2020,"As close to a perfect Scooby Doo live action movie as you can possibly get. Mathew Lillard and Linda Cardellini are literally the personification of Shaggy/Velma, not to say Freddie Prince Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar weren't good as Fred/Daphne but you don't get the Immersion of the characters like the other two.The CGI used for Scooby was great and better than you'd expect for a Scooby Doo Live movie, It surprisingly still holds up well In 2020.The Mystery Machine was a thing of beauty for the sadly short aount of time It's on screen. It's Impressive considering even the animated movies even struggle with It's design sometimes, even butchering In some movies.James Gunn did an amazing job on the screenplay of keeping the cartoon show feeling but mordernising It and adding some subtle/unsubtle adult humour .Believable friction between the gangs ego's and personalities clashing but the love Is evident.10/10 Scooby Doo movie.",Scooby-Doo

(but adorable Sarah Michelle),2,27 May 2005,"There is only a good thing about this movie and her name is: Sarah Michelle Gellar.I love Sarah Michelle but the movie sucks.I like the seventies cartoon, but now when they made a movie of that, they couldn't do it worse.The plot is so nonsense and so boring, the Scooby looks so fake, the ending so corny.. anyway i don't know what was the worst thing about the movie.But only for one thing was good to see the movie, and as i said before, that was Sarah Michelle Gellar, the drop dead gorgeous beauty now with red hair, and with that dress looked super adorable, it was good to see her after been so bored watching the film.So i'll give it 2/10, i would give it 1 but because Sarah Michelle i'll give it an extra point.",Scooby-Doo
187,RaeganBeaumont_99,What did I think..,9,19 June 2006,"Well I am a former child of the Old Scooby Doo cartoons and shows. I was a HUGE fan and i loved Scooby he was my all time favorite cartoon. I was even him in a school play :) i was very excited. Now when i heard they were making a movie, and actual movie with him I have to say i wasn't looking forward to it at all, i figured that would mess it up as they have so many others from when i was growing up. But oldest daughter however was and is a HUGE fan of the show, and Scooby so when the movie came out i figured i would take the kids, grin and bare it and let them enjoy it whether i did or not... but i have to say I REALLY DID ENJOY IT. Scooby was just as i had always imagined he would be and the character of Shaggy i honestly didn't think they would find anyone who could pull that off, but i was so thoroughly impressed with Matthew Lillard as Shaggy he nailed right down to the walk, I love him.. he was to me the epitome of Shaggy exactly what i had in my mind. The others did well also as i didn't think they would pull if off, but to my surprise they did a geat job they worked well with one another and complimented one another as well. It was great to see something that was so endeared as a child be something my kids could have that love for now. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see it or who is a true fan of the old show. They didn't ruin it, they did it justice.",Scooby-Doo
188,lanie-6,Scooby-Doo is the best movie of 2002!!!!!,10,16 June 2002,Scooby-Doo is a great movie all the way around. I took my daughter (9 years old) and her friend who is 7 years old. They laughed alot and enjoyed the movie. Myself and my husband enjoyed it also. Go in with an open mind and let yourself be a child again! It is worth watching! I will for sure buy it whenever it becomes available on DVD!,Scooby-Doo
189,Avoura,Funny and entertaining film for adults of all ages,7,7 March 2005,"This is not too much like the Scooby Doo cartoons to be boring or silly, although the opening scene is.Most of the film is set on Spooky Island, and the team try to unravel the mystery as to what is going on. Brilliant ending.Some good deleted scenes on the extras section of this DVD which are worth watching too. Well made animation and acting, it has the feel of the original where the cartoon was good, but not the bad parts of the old cartoons.This film is more science fiction/comedy than a kids cartoon-type story, and I would not recommend it for young children, it is more an adult version of Scooby Doo, (although nothing to get it an 18-rating). All innocent fun, but some scenes might be scary to children.Spoilers: I like the way they dealt with the most awful cartoon character ever, Scrappy Doo, when they threw him out of the van, in a flashback. I thought, hooray, Scrappy Doo is gone for good! I hated him always, he ruined the cartoons when I used to watch it years ago as a kid. But then they brought him back as the evil bad guy at the end, which was kind of weird, to think that all along Scrappy Doo was evil and not so good or cute after all, as some have said he was. I knew he was bad, i.e. he ruined the cartoons, but did not expect him to turn out so evil in the film -- which made for a very interesting and surprising ending. Well done the film makers, for finally putting Scrappy Doo in the level of the poo where he belongs.",Scooby-Doo
190,pkendell,I don't like this film. Not at all.,1,28 August 2002,"Lame.  Shockingly lame.  Lame beyond belief.And cynical, too - Hollywood at its most exploitative and greedy.The original cartoons were no great shakes, but this... this really lowers the bar for TV nostalgia cash-ins.And to think that Rowan Atkinson used to be funny.",Scooby-Doo
191,ardnael,What a Surprise,7,24 September 2002,"I reluctantly went to see this film with my boyfriend the other night. I am not a Scooby Doo fan at all, but decided it was better than watching them mass slaughter dragons in Reign of Fire. What a surprise this movie was...granted there were times when you could actually feel you brain sizzling from lack of intelligence, there was a scooby doo plot, a scooby doo humor, and a scooby doo ending. The writers did a better job than I expected to not loose the feeling the old Scooby Doo series left you with. And the ending was a nice breath of fresh air, no cheesy bad guys here. The acting job by all but Matthew Lillard could have used a bit of improvement. I say everyone but Matthew Lillard since he even had the cracking voice of Shaggy down pat. The only down side to this movie was the choppy graphics used in the animation of Scooby himself. You would think for having his name in the title they would have added a few more cuts into their graphics so as not to give the viewers such a headache. Must have been the producers from Blaire Witch. All in all, I would suggest this movie to anyone who was a Scooby Doo fan and would like to kill an evening at home...and a few brain cells along with it.",Scooby-Doo
192,janet1109,Kids liked it; I didn't.,4,17 June 2002,"The kids (9 & 10) liked the movie, but what do they know?  The only things I enjoyed were the voice and characterization of Scooby (right on), and to a lesser extent, the other actors in the foursome.  Velma certainly is the most interesting character.  Fred was funny just because he's such an egomaniac.  Daphne wasn't particularly interesting.I actually started to doze off during one of the chase-type scenes in the middle of the movie.  Not a good sign!",Scooby-Doo
193,Terranova79,True to the original,9,25 October 2021,I dont understand why people complain so much about this movie. I found it entertaining and cozy and appreciated that the whole gang managed to respect the cartoon rather well.Only thing that annoyd me was the white make up powder under Daphnes eyes that the makeup artist always forgot to blend out...,Scooby-Doo
194,Fmobley2746,"Not a whole lot like the cartoon, but very enjoyable",6,7 November 2010,"First off, Scooby-Doo was the first movie I saw in theaters. Yes, even though I am 17 years old I did not go to the movie theater until I was nine years old. Now that I have that out of the way let me review this scooby-tastic film! This film is definitely not like the original cartoon as you will notice about 10 minutes into the film. For this movie to even have a great plot the character's personality had to have been expanded, which is what the film makers did. Some of the things they added I liked, some I did not. I did not care for Daphne's stuck up attitude and I really thought it was strange for her to be a kung-fu master. The scene where she fought that Spanish wrestler was just over-the-top nonsense. Fred, Velma, Scooby, and Shaggy were cool. So really Daphne was the only one they actually kinda screwed up on. I thought the Shaggy/Scooby fart and belch scene was extremely awkward and now that I am older I find it extremely unnecessary. I believe they really did a great job at making Scrappy both hatable and a little sorry for at the same time.THE GOOD: 1) The fact that a Scooby-Doo movie was actually brought to the big screen and it wasn't bad.2) The character development (besides maybe Daphne) 3) the choice of having Matthew Lillard play Shaggy.4) Scooby-Doo as a character was nicely developed.5) The costume design was excellent.6) The soundtrack and score was terrific.7) It had a surprisingly nice plot, certainly not the best, but it was alright.THE BAD: 1) perhaps the choice of Sarah Michelle Gellar for the role of Daphne was not the best choice.2) Freddie Prince Jr. was great, but again, perhaps their was a better choice.3) The Scooby/Shaggy belch and fart scene.4) Daphne was annoying and the kung-fu was extremely painful to watch.5) It could have been better ENDING STATEMENTS: There are probably some other things I could mention or add if I re-watched the film. As of now this is all I have to work with.The movie was good. I enjoyed it and I do believe that is underrated.",Scooby-Doo
195,nmk2002uk,Not as bad as what they say!,7,31 March 2004,"There was a little doggy. He had four friends. They solved mysteries in their 'Mystery Machine' and unmasked a new villian every week. But the villain always said the same which became its catchphrase. ""And I would have gotten away with it too! If it wasn't for you meddling kids and that dog!"" Yes....I liked Scooby Doo. I still doo... sorry, do. I used to, and still, watch every day when I get home from work. So I was skeptical about a movie of my favourite hound being turned into a computer animation. But still, for me,...it worked! Matthew Lilard was great as Shaggy. Freddie Prinz Jr. wern't bad as Fred. He was a little 'up himself', if you will. Daphnie seemed a little like a spoilt brat but Velma, along with Shaggy, was the only one to survive the transition to the big screen. The plot, they separate after a big bust up then get back together to solve the BIG mystery, was a bit o' good writing. The best bit is in the airplane then the plane (watch for yourself. I don't want to spoil it!). But it did lack teh polish to make it great. If they had made Daphnie like she was on the show and not like Angelica of the Rugrats then she would have been lovable. The same with Fred. But still, it is a good romp. Just unplug yer brain fro an hour and a half and enjoy the fart jokes! Rooby Doo!!!",Scooby-Doo
196,Hastor-2,For the fans,8,14 June 2002,"This movie was made with fans of Scooby-Doo in mind. It has in jokes galore about the things that you never thought about until you got older, like why fred always goes with Daphne when they split up, and other stuff I wont give away. The Scrappy Doo appearance was genius. Kids may enjoy this movie as they would the cartoon, and not realize that it is a spoof of the cartoon, while still staying mostly true to it. It does to Scooby what the Brady Bunch movies did to that show. If you like watching the cartoon for fun, even though the stories are horrible at times, and just enjoy the absurdity of it all, this movie grasps that and makes fun of it at the same time. Your average movie goer might not get the jokes though, it requires a good bit of scooby knowledge to understand, but I'm glad they did it for the fans and not to please the masses. The only thing missing was a scene where shaggy and scooby fool the monsters by pretending to be waiters or barbers or something. They did that a lot in the cartoon but not in the movie. The whole scrappy thing makes up for it though. As I said, kids will enjoy it just as they do the cartoon, but I think it was made especially for older people that are big fans of scooby and love it for how absurd it is, and how fun it is when you realize it makes no sense at times.",Scooby-Doo
197,EvilTommy,Scooby Doo? Scooby Don't...,3,22 March 2003,"I don't even know where to begin with this one. No wonder it took so much post production to get it on the screen. I thought the CGI Scooby Doo was well done and the actors tried their best to make you believe they were those 'meddling kids', but what a crappy story. Even the cartoon, which was formulaic and predictable, was way better than this crap. Those full length animated films they made like 'Scooby Doo On Zombie Island' and such, were a lot better, and perhaps they should have employed those writers for the big screen. If you're going to tackle an American icon, Hollywood, do it well or leave it alone.",Scooby-Doo
198,speedyspeaker,Scooby Doo is stupidoo!,3,11 March 2006,"I have always liked the original Scooby Doo, and when I heard that there was going to be a live-action movie of it, I thought that sounded kinda cool. But when I saw it, it was nothing like the original Scooby Doo. It was terrible It was also very poor. The story was so idiotic. It went like this: the gang breaks up or something, then they win these tickets to an island and then rejoin and solve that the mystery culprit there all along was Scrappy Doo. But I kinda liked Scrappy. Why did they make him a bad guy? I guess people that he was annoying. The acting was so and so, the animation: to see a Great Dane go all computery, big deal. The music I forgot. So, over all, each film department stank, sorry! I was so embarrassed when I saw this film. It was nothing like Scooby Doo at all. There were lame jokes, dumb emotional scenes and all, yucky bathroom humor (BLECH!) and lots more thrash. So don't see it! It was so bad.",Scooby-Doo
199,Mr_Spiffy,Hilarious!,8,17 June 2002,"This film is far from a masterpiece, but those of you wanting a nostalgic trip back to a misspent youth of countless hours watching these silly shows on television (the FIRST time!), this is a lot of fun.  The kids will enjoy it, I'm sure.  But this movie was written to have the silliness to appeal to the kids, but have the jokes written for the adults.  This is truly worth watching.  My advice is to watch this when kids will be less likely to attend.  An audience filled with anklebiters will deter from your enjoyment of this wonderful film.  But enough of that. So why do I rate this silly film so high?  Perhaps it's because it was indeed a nostalgic trip to yesteryear.  And it was, in a way.  It also joked at the hidden undertones of the series: Fred's homosexuality, Shaggy's drug habit (I mean, he thinks he can talk to a dog,), Velma's lesbianism (though this isn't touched as much as Fred), Daphne and her damsel in distress bit, Daphne being used as Fred's cover-up, and the most evil character of the show is dealt with appropriately. I read other reviews on here prior to watching the film, and was expecting to be disappointed.  But as you have already guessed, I was not.  Anyone who expects to take Scooby Doo seriously needs help.  It's a comedy-mystery CARTOON, guys.  It's camp, which is why it is so fun.  And as you have read already, I'm sure, there is a burping/farting bit between Scooby and Shaggy. It goes on a bit long, and I could have lived without it, but the producers had to appeal to today's audience. Shaggy's character is done PERFECTLY.  They couldn't have chosen a better actor.  Almost all the cast was perfect.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. seems a little awkward as Fred, especially with that really bad blonde hair.  It looks very unnatural, but perhaps I am myself taking Scooby Doo too seriously here. Daphne's character change is an amusing look at the change of feminism through the ages.  But anyway, this is a fun, camp film, recreating Scooby Doo, having fun with it, and laughing at its plot holes at the same time. So stop reading this and go see it already! 8/10",Scooby-Doo
200,TMAN247,A one way ticket back to childhood.,8,25 June 2002,"This movie was a blast.  As a 33 year old, this was perfect for me, since I watched Scooby Doo religiously as a child.  Matthew Lillard portrayal as Shaggy was incredible.  He should seriously be considered for an award, since I honestly felt I was watching a cartoon character come to life.  The rest of the cast does a great job too, and the villain behind the plot was a great choice!  The only departure I saw from the cartoon plots were that the monsters in this one were real!  I went with my 6 year old niece, and she was scared a few times, but not too bad.  If your child is sensitive in these areas, then please consider that.PeacePS, ""Who's your best Friend?""

Meaning, as soon as it was over, I would rewind the VHS tape and watch it over and over again.In a live action adaption that captures the personalities of the Mystery Gang in every way, it's hard to imagine anyone else playing these characters in a live action sense.There's action, humor and honestly pretty ""adult"" horror movie stuff in here. Not in nudity or murder, but pretty deep for what many people see as a kids movie.Easily one of the most quotable movies ever, it is one where you can ignore the bad CGI and watch over and over again.It's an absolute, ""Spookah Palooza""",Scooby-Doo

I also love this film, but it sucks. Thank goodness we were able to glean one important revelation from it: Matthew Lillard is an excellent Shaggy! That fact alone makes me grateful for this film. Him aside, and perhaps Sarah Michelle Gellar, everyone is terrible. Maybe it would have benefited from the earlier intentions of a PG-13 rating, although that was beginning to fall victim to its own plethora of awful clichés. I can say it is certainly unforgettable. It's another guilty pleasure of mine and it's also great for kids. But this is an objective reality check. The acting is bad, the jokes are bad, the plot is bad. Doo happened. And it smells.

203,michalkempa,Is so bad...,1,18 September 2020,"Beginning: As soon as Scooby and his friends stop a villain disguised as a monster, they quarrel for some reason after this event, take offense at each other, and go in different directions. Do they like each other or not?
Then, when they go to ""Spooky Island"" by plane, Scooby spots the cat dressed like her. Fred tries to stop Scooby, but gets punched in the face by him. Lol.Behavior is unusual for the main characters and their appearance is kitschy. Daphne engages in martial arts and as if she did something, she screams with her arms raised, also shaking her ass ""oh yeah"", Scooby and Shaggy in one scene belch and fart. As Fred's soul flew into his body, Daphne then replied with a stupid smile that he could walk naked.Shaggy also hangs out with some kitschy doll on the island.Scrappy: I think it's some kind of joke what they did with him. As soon as a group of main characters was driving through the desert, Scrappy pissed on Daphne with a malicious laugh (thank you very much for that stupid joke), and in return he was thrown onto the road. Especially Scooby would not do that as Scrappy's uncle and guardian. In addition, Scrappy is here and a villain too, disguises himself as Mr Bean leading Spooky Island and as soon as he is stopped, Scooby punches Scrappy in the face and flies straight into the rock wall.Really bad movie.

204,DeonJ2006,Pretty good,7,5 October 2021,"Although not really the best film ever made, I enjoyed the live-action Scooby-Doo movie. It had a good story, solid acting, and definitely feels like Scooby-Doo.There are some flaws such as some dated CGI (Scooby and Scrappy actually look decent for the most part, but the monsters have aged poorly), noticeable executive meddling and the questionable idea of making Scrappy-Doo a villain (I think it's funny to see them poke fun at a character that is highly-disliked, but I think making him an antagonist is a bit far-fetched), but I found it quite solid overall.",Scooby-Doo
205,mukor,Surprise! Surprise! This movie doesn't suck!,6,12 July 2002,"I was a reluctant viewer.  I waited and waited to see this movie,relegating it to the video first group of films that seem to litter thecinematic landscape with all to much frequency these days.  ThenI made a error in film going; I went to see Men in Black II whichwas so bloody awful I needed a cinematic break to cleanse thepalate.  And I had already seen Minority Report and Spiderman theday before so those two were out.  My last hope for bubble gunrenewal lay with Scooby, Shaggy, and rest of the gang.  I enteredthe theater with a resounding *gulp* to prepare myself for the trial Iwas about to endure.  And lo and behold!  Much to my ratherpleasant surprise, Scooby Doo was a helluva lot of fun.  Anamiable, well meaning, largely juvenile film, Scooby Doo retainsmuch of the grace that the original show engendered while addinga dose of what I like the call the ""Brady Bunch Movie"" syndrome. The Brady Bunch Movie was an exercise in self awareness, a filmthat knew it was based on an awkward and fatally corny show andchose to good naturedly poke fun at that very fact.  Scooby Doodoes the same thing.  And the actors are spot on.  Matthew Lillard,in particular, is fantastic as Shaggy, the stoner cum beatnik cumfood junkie.  And Sarah Michelle Gellar is alot of fun as theeminently stupid Daphne who gives use Buffy fans a funny bit ofBuffy action as well.

206,Mic-57,Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Where's the sequal!,9,21 July 2002,"Like man, this film rocks! Atlast, I watched Scooby-Doo a few days ago and it's great. Definatly a good big screen version! There's laughs, action, and all the ingredients to live up to the cartoon. And Scoobys just as loveable as Cartoon Scooby. He looks cute, acts cute, is cute! I don't agree that this is only for under tens, I'm fifteen and I loved it! If your interested in seeing it then go see it!! The only problem I have, and I wanna get this out of the way, is that is could have been a bit longer to reach the 1 and a half hour mark. This didn't spoil the movie at all though and the movie remains hilarious to the end credits and beyond...The action scenes are great and remain funny and frantic just like the series and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing these 2-Dimensional characters jump to life in the form of such fantastic actors! And they did a great job to say that in the entire film they had to react to CGI effects that were added later! This was done incredibly well!  Now then, a look at the cast...Scooby... Scooby is brilliant and you can't help but love the cute hound as usual! He is hilariously funny, looks authentic and realistic while still remaining comical. Also his eating antics remain and are hysterical! With Matthew Lillard adding just as much humour!Shaggy... Matthew Lillard plays Shaggy and has done a damn good job too! His voice is spot on, he looks identical and is one of the funniest guys around! I heard that Mike Myers was originally set to play Shaggy but he dropped out, well good! Myers is great in the Austin Powers films but in Scooby-Doo? I don't think so. Lillard and Scooby have great chemistry to say that Scooby wasn't actually there and was added later! It takes some talent to be able to do what Lillard and crew have done and they've done great. If there's a sequal, Matthew Lillard better be in it!Daphne... Sarah Michelle Gellar IS Daphne and brings a new feisty element to the character. She even kicks ass in the finale! Bringin' some Buffy moves with an extra kick of fury! She also looks great in her many outfits!!! I always liked Daphne, and for one of my favourite actresses to play her...well it was a real treat!Fred... Freddie Prinze Jr. is a good choice as the leader of the group and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing him, he also brings a more funny element that the cartoon version may have lacked a little. While not a central as Scooby, Shaggy and Daphne, Fred is still a good character!Velma... Not having seen Linda Cardellini in many programs before, I was pleasantly pleased with how good she is at playing Velma. I think she's definatly a rising star and has been given a great oppurtunity in this movie! Jinkies!Scooby-Doo has an excellent cast, who don't dissapoint and bring laughs through the entire duration.

207,Chewbacca_42,Subtly Subversive Scooby Doobie Doo,6,17 October 2005,"Upon second stoned viewing my endearment is renewed. The marijuana references will fly above the wee ones' little noggins. For the rest of us, it's a quintessential high home entertainment experience. Whereas the vulnerable compromised mind might panic from genuine chills and thrills, the mild scares herein enhanced by intoxication fit just right. The golden twosome, Fred and Daphne are himbo and bimbo incarnate, while Velma predictably suffers from mortal cartoon myopia and a body of knowledge limited only by plot requirements. Stoner stars, Shaggy and Scooby are happily single-minded in their pursuit of munchies, while remaining lovably selfish and craven. Ultimately, the crew rises to the occasion even if it requires slight departure from caricature. With suitable scatologies, Scooby's infectious cackle, and single-minded snack fixation, it's a ""runderful"" romp, not to be enjoyed sober. P.S. Cartoonish CGI complements the mood, so don't have a cow about it, okay?",Scooby-Doo
208,stealthspyguy,Not as good as sequel...,8,6 June 2006,"Scooby Doo really caught my attention. After I watched Scooby Doo 2, it became my favorite movie, but this is about Scooby Doo, which isn't as good as Scooby Doo 2, but still was good. Scooby Doo seems to combine a lot of different genres. It has action, suspense, comedy, mystery, and adventure, all in one movie. However, I think that Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) basically, in the end, took over the show. He was the guy that seemed to save the day in the end of the movie by saving Scooby Doo, and being the only one that did not get captured. Despite that part, it did sort of seem cool that Scrappy Doo was the enemy in the end. It sort of linked to the part where Velma was talking about how they had kicked out Scrappy. I would recommend this to anyone, except for those that don't like Scooby Doo 2. If you already don't like Scooby Doo 2, I guarantee you won't like this movie. It's not quite as good.",Scooby-Doo

Just a fun little movie with CGI Scooby in it, but I haven't had such a good time in a movie in a long time. I definitely consider it the best movie I've seen this year. Anyone who's a fan of the series or even used to watch it will get a big kick out of everything here. The characters are all here. I was a little annoyed that Freddy and Daphne weren't really much like their cartoon alter egos but at least it didn't get in the way. Matthew Lillard was SPOT ON as Shaggy...and what a cool surprise to find Rowan Atkinson in here too! And the cool thing is...the movie was frequently really creepy. All the imagery and monsters and spooks were totally in line with the series and were legitimately ""spooky"". Even the plot wasn't boring. It kept moving at a really fast pace so you didn't have time to get bored which is important. Overall a great comedy for an old scooby-snacker like myself! ROOBY ROOBY ROOOOOOO!",Scooby-Doo
210,DarthBotto,No Mystery Whatsoever,3,6 March 2006,"Huh... This wasn't much a mystery, I must admit. You have no mystery at all, actually. In fact, WTF was the storyline, again? Like you have A huge computer animated monsrtocity in the middle of the screen, and you call it the main character. The jokes weren't even original. They were more like old Shakespeare jokes that the villain would chuckle. Or at least, something from the sixties. Wait... I've laughed at a few things from the sixties. Plus... there's a big thing about real monsters and spirits added in. I actually like the good old idea of taking off the mask to reveal some hick in a costume.

211,halkyra,A great movie for older kids and ok for the rest of us,7,11 July 2002,I think if you are a Scooby fan and if you have old children around 7-12 then you will enjoy this film. The film was more like the recent Scooby Doo Cartoon Movies that are out on Video and DVD (i.e. Zombie Island) instead of the older Cartoons that used to come out on Saturday Mornings.I'm a Scooby Doo fan and I went with my children so I had a blast. You won't like this movie if you are someone whose movie enjoyment hinges on how well the actors perform their role (though Shaggy was perfect). You also won't enjoy this movie unless you think a dog passing gas is funny.Luckily my children did and a great time was had by all!,Scooby-Doo
212,Garry-10,"Scooby Don't make a sequel, please.",3,7 August 2002,"Shockingly bad. I mean, I knew it was going to be poor, but this bad? Dragged along by my seven year old daughter, who is entranced by thirty year old re-runs on Cartoon Network (and they haven't aged well, speaking as someone who used to rush home from school to watch it), I didn't expect the cynical, set-piece laden exercise in making money which was served up. The good bits: any time Scooby (and therefore Shaggy, who Matthew Lilliard gets to a 'T') is on screen (and it isn't as much as you'd think it would be, couldn't they afford the computer time?). The bad bits: the rest, boy does it draaaaaaaaagggggg. The plot is weak, isn't explained very well and is thus confusing, but never mind because here comes another set piece that has absolutely nothing to do with advancing the plot. Why does Velma change from dowdy and homely into sex vamp, and back again? Why is Sarah Michelle Geller completely unbelievable as Daphne - she's a fine actress, but she sure does need to get away from playing Buffy clones? Why did I want to punch Freddy Prinze Jr. every time he appeared? A cynical lazy Hollywood pic, lowest common denominator stuff, recycling ideas that weren't really that good in the first place and should have been left well alone. Already setting up the sequel at the end as well. Please, don't do it.Within an hour of the film ending, my daughter was struggling to remember ANYTHING she liked about the film, bar -surprise- the fart scene. She was more entranced by the fast food she'd had afterwards.",Scooby-Doo

Linda Cardellini does a good Velma as well (but Fred and Daphne...not good casting there).The use of old scooby gags (overly complicated traps that dont work right, but end up working etc.)do provide a bit of nostalgia.

216,Nootered,The Scooby Doo Doo,1,7 November 2015,"Sigh... This joke has been done before, but there's more Doo Doo than Scooby and there's more Crappy than Scrappy..Where do I begin? I'm torturing myself just to review my thoughts on this film for you guys. Just going to hop straight into it.The beginning starts off with a bloody hip hop yo yo Scoob piece of crap. The song sounds cheap and too modern for my liking. Representing the kids nowadays and their love for Drake and Kanye West. Surprisingly enough, it ends at the typical scooby episode with Daphne already bloody captured by nothing. Why do I say nothing, because the CGI is horrible. I've seen better CGI In goldeneye's opening sequence. I mean dear god! The ghost looks like a stock footage paste in and doesn't fit in with the background. Scooby now looks like a freakish dog mutant. There are such pleasant images in this film for its crappy cgi. Also makes no sense how they literally quit after completing the mystery. Even worse than the reason of why Spider Man quit in Spider Man 2!Since I'm bored of reviewing this awful excuse I'm just going to say that the monster is REAL and the bloody villain is Scrappy. Everyone is out of character, they'd never do what they did to scrappy on the original franchise. This film can go to hell...",Scooby-Doo
217,jacals-montfy,All time classic,6,25 November 2020,"So I am only giving this a six from a purely cinematic point of view: the script is cringy, the set looks SO fake and the CGI is dated. But these are what makes the film so good!
This is a children's movie, and so the goofy lines are just funny and endearing, the set is just bonkers, but so detailed at the same time that it looked like a genuinely fun theme park and the CGI is amazing considering it was 2002. The 'souls' of the humans are exquisite. Basically very James Gunn.
The actors also nail what they were trying to do. The classic gang bring energy and perfects the classic tropes of the characters.
This is funny, fun and pure joy.",Scooby-Doo
218,BTRALover100,"If not for Shaggy and Scooby, one of the worst adaptations ever",7,20 June 2002,"The summary pretty much sums up my feeling about this movie.  Any classic Scooby fan will like this film for its entertainment, but not for anything to do with Scooby Doo, and here is why I feel that way.After watching about 30 episodes in one week, I performed a small role analysis on Scooby Doo once for a psych course, and things don't pan out well with the movie.  Most of the time in the series, Fred was the one who kept the group together and was a natural leader.  What some won't recognize is that when it came to getting his hands dirty though, it was a sign of fear on his part that the group was always using Shag and Scoob for the dangerous parts and maybe a little machismo in that he always went with Daphne.  But Fred as a vain, self-centered, retard as in the movie? Hello, Fred solved half of the mysteries.  It wasn't all Velma.  Fred was the leader because of his likability.  Here, Fred is not likeable at all and Freddie Prince was a horrible choice for the part.  I like Prince as an actor, he simply didn't have the physique to play the part and his emotional spread wasn't there.  I don't know who to blame, but I'm going with the writers since I think he's done better.  Furthermore, I did NOT want him and Daphne to get together, as I always hoped in the cartoons.Then there is Daphne.  For goodness sakes.  Buffy is hot and a good actress, but Daphne was in no way a ""woman of the 90's"".  In the newer Scooby Doo movies, they did a really good job of modernizing her, especially in Zombie Island (where the monsters were also real).  She was an individual career woman and her wealth was underplayed.  She was still able to be attractive without being a ditz.  She had just enough vulnerability to make her endearing to Fred.  But here she comes off much more self-centered (although not so much as Fred by a long shot in the movie) and a martial arts expert. Why would she even hang out with the rest of these misfits?  The whole universe is thrown out of whack.  To put it in the words of another favorite modern kids cartoon, it really WOMPED.Next, there's Velma.  Her vulnerability is shown through her glasses dependence, along with a little comic relief.  She is the intelligent one. Here is another place where this film upset me.  They go to all the trouble of modernizing Daphne, and then they go and throw back Velma.  Here was the woman of the 90's invented in the 60's, but in this film, she is prone to peer pressure and just wants to be cool.  Well, Velma always was cool and sure of herself.  She didn't need the accolade of others, she had her own intrinsic motivations.  With the exception that Velma is totally hot in this film, they screwed her.  The actress did an excellent job playing the part that was directed and we will definitely being seeing more of her, but the part itself stunk.  I in no way pitied the character and wanted her to be liked, instead, I wanted her to just get the you know what slapped out of her until she came to her senses.Finally, there is Shaggy and Scooby.  Yes, I saved the best for last. Lillard and Scooby were excellent.  Lillard, although somewhat type cast when you look at his parts (and he needs to do more without Prince) is the key to this film.  His interplay with Scooby is believable.  The computer graphics are believable.  But even here the writers and directors messed up a good thing.  The drug scene was always an implication in the toons.  It in no way needed to be anything more than that.  Most children under 12 do not pick up on the drug hints in the cartoons.  Well, there is no way to miss it her.  Boo on hollywood for this one.  Should have been PG-13, and then maybe they would have rewritten it a little to get back a PG rating, like getting rid of the drug parts.  I don't remember weed smoke coming out of the Mystery Machine, do you?  For that matter, they're sort of saying then that all of the kids did drugs if only second hand, which is sort of implied in the series as well, but it doesn't need to be in the movie this way.Lastly, we all hate Scrappy.  Can we agree on that one.  I especially liked the handling of him on the Cartoon Network when they did the Scooby Doo Project.  Velma and Daphne go running when they hear da-da-da-da---da-da. Velma tells Daphne, It's only Scrappy, and then Daphne replies as she is running, ""I know.""  Made me laugh and laugh.I know some other commenters didn't like real monsters.  Well, that didn't kill this film.  Zombie Island had real monsters and it was good.  Witch's Ghost had a real witch and it was good.  This had real monsters and it stunk, flat out.  If I didn't have free tickets, I wouldn't see it.  I have every Scooby available on DVD, but I will NOT be buying this on DVD unless it is under $12, and even then, I will only get it for Lillard/Shaggy and Scooby.  Lillard's Scooby was even better and made me laugh more than SNL's parody.",Scooby-Doo
219,chr1sberg,One of the worst films since Zoolander...,1,14 June 2002,"Ok, I had been waiting and waiting this week for The Bourne Identity to come out. I arrived at the theater around 4:30 today (Friday, opening day), and was dismayed to find all shows sold out before 7:15. I walked in, ripped my ticket, and looked around for a movie to watch while I waited an hour and a half. Scooby-Doo was about to start. Hmm..I walked in, sat down, and saw lots and lots of kids. Lots. Oodles. It was packed. I settled down for what might be a somewhat ok movie, and wanting to see how Matt Lillard would do as Shaggy.I have to start with this tho, the Harry Potter ""Episode 2"" preview was the best thing about Scooby-Doo.Horribly Cast (outside of Matt Lillard, who did as well as he could with such a poorly written role), terribly acted, extremely poorly written, I could only suffer about an hour of this montrosity before I eventually walked out for of a movie for only the 3rd time in my life (Zoolander being the last one). As soon as they found ""the secret control room"" which showed that they were ""brainwashing teenagers"", I think I had enough. I understand they were trying to capture the feel of the cartoon, but even in that they sorely failed. The CG was shoddy, and the only positive point outside of Lillard's voice were a few unfunny guest cameos (just cool to see them in such a hollywood mishmash).My conclusion: Worst movie so far this year. Avoid it like the plague. Oh, yeah, and Bourne Identity was excellent. 0/10.",Scooby-Doo

221,alvin81,Fun and amusing,6,17 November 2002,"One of the most highly anticipated releases of 2002, the live-action version of 'Scooby Doo' was grilled by the critics, and perhaps unfairly so. Credit must go to the casting director who picked the perfect cast to portray Fred, Velma, Daphne, and especially Shaggy. Matthew Lillard's portrayal of Shaggy is dead-on, and he easily rescues any dull spots in the script. Linda Cardellini's Velma is also near perfect, and quite enjoyable as well as appealing. The computer generated Scooby-Doo is not half-bad, and the overall feeling of the movie is that great time and care was given to the special effects. Unfortunately, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze, Jr. fall flat as Daphne and Fred. Prinze, the king of bad movie choices, is particularly annoying. Their interpretations of the classic Hanna-Barbera characters are beefed up for this movie, and become tiresome. Sadly, British actor Rowan Atkinson (of 'Mr. Bean' fame) is totally wasted. His character never gets a chance to develop, which is a mystery within itself. While the plot could have been better, the film is executed very well. The Spooky Island atmosphere is eclectic and colorful, with an amazing amount of detail. While the script is not the greatest, the 86-minute flick does not let up for a minute. What makes the movie either appealing or pathetic is the fact that bathroom humor is sprinkled throughout the movie. It can be hysterically funny (Shaggy and Scooby-Doo's burping/farting contest is hysterical), but children who were expecting the cartoon humor will be caught offguard. Another plot screw-up is the idea of the five-some angrily splitting up in the beginning. The audience is fully aware that the group (dubbed 'Mystery, Inc.') will get back together to solve the mystery, so the first ten minutes of the movie is wasted as the viewer waits inpatiently for the group to reunite. If the movie bombed at the box office, is does not seem to matter, since 'Scooby-Doo 2' is due for a 2004 release. Hopefully, the writers will tie up some loose ends (and replace Prinze), and make the next installment of what looks to be an ongoing series, better than the first.",Scooby-Doo
222,yumin_ch,"Wonderful Cast, Terrible Script",6,9 November 2019,"The cast of the live version of Scooby-Doo is wonderful. I love how they bear so much resemblance to the characters in the animated version. They really do bring the animated version to live.However, the script for this movie is nothing like what you'd expect to see from any Scooby-Doo episode. It is plain senseless and full of crazy voodoo mumbo jumbo. The original Scooby-Doo series is somewhat logical, but this one screams a loud Wizards of Waverly Place tone. The movie fails to explain how the entire magic thing works, or at least it is done in a really poor way. None of the things in this movie makes any logical sense in real life.I love Scooby-Doo, but I wish this movie had a better script.",Scooby-Doo

Scooby was perfect.  Velma was sooooo Velma.  The characterizations of Fred and Daphne were a bit off, but I think that's because Fred and Daphne are boring, so they had to do something with them.  I've seen criticism of SMG playing Buffy, I didn't see that, playing the BuffyBot now that I'd believe. They played homage to Daphne's knack for being kidnapped, to Scooby Snack Bribes, to Scooby's amazing ability to become a suitcase! What really sold me though was Scrappy.  I can't tell you how much I hate Scrappy.  Glad to know the Gang wasn't all that fond of him either.  My niece (13) and nephew (5) protested Scrappy's portrayal, but it sold me the movie, lock, stock, and Scooby/Shaggy in a barrel.

224,KenseidenXL,"My choice for the ""Golden Turkey"" for worst film of the year.",1,14 June 2002,"Since there are so many things wrong with film, it is better if I start with the ONE good bit: Linda Cardellini was cast as ""Velma"". THIS was the only good casting in the whole film. She obviously watched the original cartoons. Hers was the only performance worth the price of a matinee ticket (if you pay full price for one, then you need to have your head examined). God knows, nobody else did. The WORST bit of casting has to go to Sarah Michelle ""Buffy"" Gellar. Are there no natural red-heads in Hollywood that they gave a bad dye-job to a bottle-blonde with only minimal talent? Just off the top of my head, I could recommend Elisa Donovan. Another bad idea: making Daphne into a ""Valley Ninja"". Do I have to point out how idiotic THIS is? Matthew Lillard does a fair/good turn as ""Shaggy"". Freddie Prinze, jr. however, is NO ""Fred"", even with the other bad dye-job.I agree with Leah Rosen of ""People"" magazine that only the VERY young (under 6) will find anything remotely funny about this yutz. This is one time where the mixing of CGI and live-action failed miserably. Putting it like this: The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle was far better. This is hands-down, one of the worst films I have ever seen. I feel sorry for Linda Cardellini, she deserved a better film to break-out in. She is WAY too talented for this pile of trash. She strikes me as the only actress who make Velma look HOT in that get-up (she has great legs).",Scooby-Doo

When it came out on video, I immediately wanted it because I remembered everything about how much I enjoyed it. Being older now, my appreciation has decreased for this movie. The acting is OK, it doesn't commit too well to the original cartoon, and, despite being kids humor, I didn't find it that funny. But why is it that deep down, my childhood heart is telling me that I still like this movie? I guess there are a few reasons. All right, I admit I do chuckle at some parts, although I said before I didn't find it that funny. And I also like the creativity they put in it. I really liked the ideas of the monsters and what they do. And although the CGI isn't spectacular, it was still the beginning of the CGI reign, so they at least gave it a shot. I also remember seeing it in the the theaters, and Scooby's first appearance made the entire theater cheer. It was the first time seeing him on the big screen. He might not have been a cartoon, but it was still that great Dane kids knew and loved. So, overall, I guess it's a guilty pleasure.

Then I heard that Freddie Prinze and Sarah Michelle Gellar were cast... and I knew it was over. But wait... I knew I had to at least give this movie a chance. So I went opening day. There were about 10 other people my age in attendence and scores upon scores of little kids. I can tell you, the kids were definately entertained. Other than the laughter (which there were lots), they were quiet and seemed very enthused. As for me, I laughed my butt off through most of the movie. The movie had a very cartoony feel, which really made it all work. From Scooby, who after a few minutes I fully accepted as Scooby, to the clothing, sound effects and such, it was a live action cartoon. As for the acting. Matthew Lillard was Shaggy Incarnate, it was almost scary how much like Shaggy he was. Linda Cardellini was also very good as Velma, and by the end of the movie, she was perfect. Even Freddie and Sarah pulled off their roles adequately, but were definately overshadowed by Lillard and Cardellini. There were a lot of homage to the original cartoon, from plot devices to catch phrases. In closing, this is one of the best cartoon to live action adaptations I've seen.

237,kobus21,Scooby for the new generation,10,29 June 2002,"To make this short I absolutely loved this movie.  I was surrounded by the age-group of 5-12 years old and I think I laughed harder than all of them together.  Being a truly dedicated Scooby fan I am glad to say that the film makers stayed true to the roots of the original cartoon.  Matthew Lillard was absolutely fantastic.  He's got the look, the voice, the little laugh, the perfect embodiment of Norville 'Shaggy' Rogers.  Isla Fisher was almost definately a scene stealer.  10 out of 10.",Scooby-Doo
238,tropicthunderhead,Scooby Does NOT...,1,21 June 2002,"Forget the HYPE, this movie stinks!  It doesn't know which audience to play for 3 year olds or adults.  It also doesn't know whether it should be campy or cartoonish.  It's a jumbled mess that only did well because of the Very LARGE and VERY EXPENSIVE marketing. If you want something to keep the kids busy, spend the money on a new toy and watch the cartoon! My rating 1...HORRIBLE DESPITE HYPE!",Scooby-Doo

Plot; standard scoob fair. Acting; standard Hollywood family film tosh. Waste of a licence; Almost definately!Two acceptions to the rule: Liallards acting, what a great shaggy voice. Scrappy doo's first appearence, How many of us over the age of 16, actually like him, Huh? exactly!!Very disapponted. Please WB, work harder on making next years follow-up accessable to all.",Scooby-Doo
240,cmon3590,Scooby Don't!!,1,18 December 2004,"As far as cartoons go, Scooby Doo is one of the weaker, sillier offerings, so why anyone thought they could make a 2 hour movie out of it is beyond me. What material did they think they were working with?Anyway, I would never have watched this movie in my wildest dreams, (even with Rowan Atkinson in it!) but my 5 year old son got the DVD. The script is stupid, the acting from Sarah-Michelle Gellar and Freddy Prinze Jr insultingly lackluster and the sexual innuendo ever-present and offensive. For example, at one stage, Daphne (Gellar) makes it safely through a dangerous tunnel and starts half-moaning 'Oh yeah! Oh yeah!' If you closed your eyes you could be listening to 'Debbie Does Dallas'! I'm not the sort of puritanical parent that flips out if my kid accidentally sees someone's bum on screen or something, but one thing I am getting sick of is Hollywood making kids cartoons into teen/adult soft porn. Kids go to these movies expecting to see a big screen version of the cartoons they like and instead are presented with sticky adult material. My guess is that the producers know there isn't much genuine material to work with, so they just go for the sex card. This may work for the 18 year old guys, but as the parent of a small child it is incredibly annoying.Overall, the movie was shocking! Badly directed, horrendously scripted and nothing but a vehicle for Gellar and Prinze Junior's US teen appeal. When Sarah-Michelle Gellar came to Australia's Gold Coast to make this movie she complained about the food in the area. Well Sarah-Michelle, I've eaten Gold Coast food and seen your movie, and I know which one I prefer to do!!Forget this film if you care about not offending yourself!!I rate it 0/10!",Scooby-Doo
241,nineandthreequarters,"""The same old stuff""... with a Scooby-Doo bent",5,28 September 2006,"If you've seen the Brady Bunch and Addams Family movies, you'll have a fair idea what to predict with this film: old sitcom characters trying to live their lives in modern America, self-parodying self-confessions of how absurd they are pepper the movie, culture clash between characters' world and 'new' world gives the chance to fill the movie with the stand-up comics' standard repertoire of topics (wedgies, airline food, diets, burps, farts, teen lingo, cosmetic surgery). So, if you're expecting any new directions in comedy and pop culture referencing, you'll be disappointed. However, if you like Scooby-Doo but don't see it as a sacred cow... er, great dane... you'll enjoy seeing it get the standard comic treatment.When the story opens with Mystery Inc breaking up, Velma is irked that she once again is the brains behind the operation while Fred gets all the public glory as the 'leader' and Daphne gets her dim-witted self into trouble. This sets the tone for a movie full of self-references, including the inevitable Scooby-Doo jokes about their villains always being someone in a mask, the shark-jumping addition of Scrappy-Doo to the cast and the standard closing line, ""I woulda got away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids"". When the gang is unknowingly reunited to solve the case of who is terrorising teens at the Spooky Island resort, the movie glides along through a formula from a Hollywood text book. It then takes us to the conclusion wherein the villain being a masked Scrappy Doo seeking vengeance on Mystery Inc. It's a neat twist, but ultimately lacks punch despite causing a few chuckles.",Scooby-Doo
242,Dr. Who,Great flick,10,25 June 2002,"This a good film with great humor.  It kept true to the cartoon as I remember it as a kid.

243,da_browns_rule,A Laugh RIOT!!! Almost a 10....one main flaw,9,15 June 2002,"This movie would've been a 10 had it not been for TOTALLY screwing up Fred and Scrappy. Other than that, the movie was flawless! Scooby, while not life-like and Shaggy were both DEAD SOLID PERFECT!!!  They're the main focus of the television show anyway and while Velma was great and Daphne was almost great (the Kung-Fu nonsense was total garbage, but otherwise perfect) the total slandering and debotchery of Fred and Scrappy can be overlooked because of the others' performance. While there is no way that this movie will gross as much as Spidey or Star Wars, it was more enjoyable and fun (this is coming from somebody whose all-time favorite movie is Star Wars).Completely makes up for the retarded Flintstones movies and the good, but WAY too serious Josie and the Pussycats movie. What's next, Jetsons?See it!! Love it and then see it again!!",Scooby-Doo
244,jtesto,A FAITHFUL ADAPTATION OF THE CARTOON,10,15 June 2002,"People you seem to be going into this with the expectations of Memento, Fargo, or some other critically acclaimed masterpiece.  It's not--it's a kids movie.  Not a Brad Bunch-ish take filled with lots of inside dirty jokes, but an honest to gosh kids movie.  Like Spy Kids or The Great Mouse Detective.  That's all.  Kids are the target audience, and they will like it.  The film accurately captures the feel and plot of the cartoon (complete with the ""brainwash room"", etc.) And Sarah, Freddie, Linda, and Matt ALL fill out their parts PERFECTLY. They're doing a live action cartoon, not Shakespeare for cryin' out loud. All in all, Scooby-Doo is great children's fun.",Scooby-Doo
245,climber700,Some people must have been watching the wrong cartoon,7,17 June 2002,"This film was exactly a carbon copy of the old tv. series that i enjoyed so much as a kid.  I don't know what these other people are referring to when they write that this was not faithful to the cartoon.  Okay were you watching another cartoon that involved a dog named Scooby Doo and his crime fighting gang?     This was packed with memorable lines or phrases such as:  ""Puppy Power!"" ""Zoinks!"" ""Jeekies"" ""I would have gotten away with it to if it weren't for you meddling kids."" It was oozing with similarities to the series like the disgusting delights that Scooby and Shaggy enjoyed, the very little amount of clues that were gathered during a case, the elaborate plans to catch the bad guy that somehow managed to work.  It was all there, but some moviegoers failed to recognize it.     I highly suggest that everyone that made this false accusation tune into Cartoon Network sometime soon and rewatch an episode of Scooby Doo.  Pay close attention to this beloved toon of your childhood that entertained you so much because somewhere in the growing up process you forgot it.
  (Also give Sarah Michelle Gellar a break she didn't have as many famous sayings and as interesting a character to work with.  You try to impersonate a girl that does nothing in the cartoon besides hanging out with fred and being nabbed all the time.)",Scooby-Doo
246,aanderson-3,Lillard was the only thing to save this pathetic movie!,2,14 March 2004,"I was so excited to seeing this movie, a real-life version of one of my fave cartoons from when I was a kid.  But, sadly I was horribly disappointed! The acting was terrible, save one actor who actually saved the film, and the script was not much better than the acting.The only actor who seems to have researched the part and stay true to the cartoon was Matthew Lillard (Shaggy).   Linda Cardellini (Velma) was close, but Freddie Prinze Jr. (Fred) and Sarah Michelle Gellar (Daphne) were TERRIBLE!!  In the cartoon, Daphne was not a totally winy, baby nor was such a snob.  I think t hat Gellar forgot to act and was just herself.  As for Freddie Prinze Jr., I have never cared for him.  The ONLY thing that saved this film was Matthew Lillard, who was so true to the cartoon Shaggy that it is hard to tell them apart.Aside from the acting, the script was really pathetic!  With all of the Scooby Doo cartoon episodes, I would have thought they could have come up with a better script than the one that made it through!  I think that there should have been many, many more rewrites!",Scooby-Doo
247,jack-frost,SCOOBY ROCKS !!!!,10,14 September 2002,"I've always been a big fan of horror films and when I was too young to watch them, SCOOBY was my favourite cartoon because it had cool heroes and I could see all sorts of monsters in it. Even now that I'm an adult, I still find a lot of pleasure in watching an episode. Just to say that I wasn't very excited at the perspective of seeing my cult cartoon turned into an unnamable stuff as the first pictures in the magazines announced a visually ridiculous movie with probably (like most of the other TV series adaptations) a boring and incoherent script.When I left the theater, I was in love with this movie. It's a Scooby fan's dream come true.The film's never ridiculous: a colourfull and coherent universe was built around the visual of the cartoon. It's a very rare thing but this time, an exact transposition of a cartoon is perfect and doesn't breed an example in visual bad taste.The script intelligently breaks several rules of the cartoon in order to bring more deepness to the characters. For example, Daphne's tired to be the eternal ""stupid"" beauty in danger and Velma can't stand Fred's attitude anymore as he always acts as if he had solved the mysteries alone. But these efforts would have been vain if a ""dream team"" of actors hadn't been gathered around the hilarious Scooby. Even if the team's composed of five characters, they're all treated with the same importance, and that's rare enough to be underscored.Matthew LILLARD IS Shaggy: he reproduces perfectly the attitude of the animated character and his capacity to make you believe in the virtual Scooby is very impressive: when he's with him, you feel like if the dog was really on the set. The duo's perfect.Sarah Michelle GELLAR and Freddie PRINZE Jr have a very communicative energy. It's obvious that they had a very good time playing the two ""beautiful and quite stupid"" characters of the team. Even if the role of Daphne was written with ""Buffy"" references, Sarah Michelle GELLAR succeeds in preserving the essence of the character: I never thought about Buffy when I saw her as Daphne.And the last but not the least, Linda CARDELLINI delivers an outstanding performance as Velma. She took the animated character and managed to make her more human, funnier and even touching by bringing all sorts of irresistible details and mimics as for example in the way she laughs or says that she's the most clever of the team. Great job for a great actress.I hope that no sequel will ever reach the screen if any of them is missing from the cast.The story's quite simple but very well paced and entertaining. There are lots of cool dialogues and ""private jokes"" for the series' fans. All the gags are in the tone of the cartoon and always effective. I wasn't in favor of the use of martial arts through the character of Daphne but finally, kung fu fits in the universe of SCOOBY DOO as it's used with parsimony to bring a few more good gags.As a conclusion, I would say that SCOOBY DOO's a terrific movie: it's fun, fast and very well acted.I found in it everything that made me love the cartoon and even more. Don't miss it if you're a SCOOBY fan: you won't regret it!",Scooby-Doo

SCOOBY DOO kicked ass!!!!! wow, i really, really loved this movie. it was made especially for fans of the show, which i am. there were many funny parts, relating to character speculations of the show. The cast (i know many people doubted their talents) was perfect. Linda Cardellini was the big surprise for me, i loved her as velma!!! Lillard was great, as shown in commercials, Gellar is very good with Daphne, even Prinze Jr. was good/ok. and im just goin to say that anyone who hates scrappy will love this movie!!!The perfect re-creation of my fav. cartoon of all time - 10/10",Scooby-Doo
249,timdmgd,Just how a live action flick of a cartoon should be. (2 spoilers),7,13 July 2002,"*** I made the huge mistake of commenting on this movie after only seeing the first half, sorry ***This is a movie I didn't want to bother going to see at the cinema but I was curious to see (like Potter I suppose). I managed to download it about 3 weeks back and it's been sitting on my drive since then. Tonight I wanted to clear some space so I watched this before trashing it and I'm really glad I did. It immediately made me think of the cartoon that I haven't seen for so many years. 'Nothing unusual about that' you may be thinking but for me, 'Flintstones' spring to mind. How rubbish that was. (Thinking about that, the ""brought to life"" part was great, it was just the story that sucked). I think that this has to be the best 'human' version of a cartoon I've ever seen. I did get a bit p***ed off when Scrappy Doo made an appearance but thankfully (and again at the end of the movie but...... I'll let you find out), it was only a very brief one.

I thought that they went a little overboard when Daphny was fighting like Buffy the vampire slayer, And the worst part was Fred. It in no way reflected the Fred from the cartoon. This scripting of Fred was doomed. But the movie had a decent story line, and had it's moment's. I just expected more.

The movie honors the cartoon cliches but also pokes a little humor at the same time.My favorite line is when Shaggy and Scooby are having a fight.

Scooby points out ""so do you!""If you like this movie try ""Scooby Do on Zombie Island"" which also pokes fun at the classic cartoon.",Scooby-Doo
253,ETZ_Critic,Gut-wrenching Doesn't Even Cut It,1,5 December 2017,"This atrocity had all the potential needed.The budget exceeded $45 million, the costumes were as close to their source material as they could get (Granted, Daphne's costume was inaccurate, but that was probably the best they could do.), and the original theme tune was used.Unfortunately, Matthew Lillard playing Shaggy for the first time is the only significant thing this movie has going for it as he was the only cast member who was even trying. It's a miracle he's improved on his pathetic performance in this flick.The rest comes off as dark, boring, and disturbingly offensive. Episode II of Star Wars was released the same year as this disaster, but that movie was better without question. It didn't have a guy going into a girl's body and saying joyfully, ""I can look at myself naked."" That line is so perverted that not only am I ashamed to think about it myself, but it also undeniably makes this movie at least 1 trillion worse than the Star Wars prequels put together.",Scooby-Doo

It is a fantastic film well worth watching, it made me laugh so much although that might just be my childish sense of humour! Even though it didn't have much to do with the original cartoons, I still enjoyed the twist at the end (which was NOT predicable!) The soundtrack is great, very catchy tunes which I discovered my brother singing more than once. The second one, 'Monsters Unleashed,' was better though, as it has more humour which made me laugh until I cried!",Scooby-Doo

It's Scooby Doo...what did you expect?  If you've ever seen the original cartoons I think you'll be pleasantly surprised how this movie turns out.  Sure, I went into the movie with low expectations but I ended up enjoying it.  I'll have to agree with the rest of you that only Shaggy & Velma played their roles up to par while Daphne and Fred just didn't get it.  This doesn't hurt the movie though because there's so much going on.  It's very fast paced and never boring.  Scooby always adds his fun when the movie slows down a bit.

He said that Scooby should look like a real dog and the animation is horrible, I would recommend the director to watch Shrek or Monsters inc. to see how you animate animal looking characters.Second he said he wanted to stay true to the cartoon, and the movie is light years away from it. My final thought is: I understand that if you make a movie about a famous cartoon it's going to make money no matter how bad it is.

Sarah Michelle Gellar (Daphne) and husband Freddie Prinze Junior (Fred) are great on screen together and Linda Cardilli (Velma) plays the lovable nerd character alongside Matthew Lillard (Shaggy) who probable is one of the best actors in the movie beside smg who is just amazing.Scooby Doo is a great family movie and it upsets me when I see people rate it as an adult movie.

It is funny for grownups and teenagers, while still being entertaining and appropriate for kids.  In fact, this is the first Freddy Prinze Jr. movie I have seen where, after which, I didn't want my money back.

267,vardak,"Always liked the TV show, but the movie sucks.",2,10 November 2002,"I'll be honest and admit that I only made it about 20-25 minutes into this movie before I gave up.  That's right, if I'd been in the theater, I'd have walked out!  I almost wish that I had been, because pressing ""Stop"" wasn't nearly as satisfying as storming out would have been.  I still stormed out of the room, but that just wasn't the same.I grew up watching the cartoon, always enjoyed it, and even though I don't have much use for it as an adult, I still think more highly of it than of 90% of the other cartoons that I grew up with.  Now, I don't particularly think that it deserves a movie, but I sat down to watch it with an open mind, hoping that it might at least revive pleasant memories of the TV show. Wrong!Sight gags that work for an animated cartoon just aren't enough to justify an entire movie, yet that seems to be just what they were attempting with this film.  Worse still, they just don't work without the animation. Stupid, unlikely, piano-from-the-sky type antics are ok when Wile E. Coyote is on screen, but not when a real actor is dodging them.  And when I see a real person running from a ghost, I expect the ghost to be truly frightening, not look like a guy in a three dollar Halloween costume. They probably thought they were being true to the original show, where you could always tell that the bad guys weren't real ghosts.  But then the characters were animated, so you could pretend that they were stupid enough to fall for it.  With a real person, though, no one can suspend disbelief enough to imagine them truly being scared by that.  Then again, it's hard to suspend disbelief enough to believe anybody would make this movie and think that it was good.Anyway, I gave it a 2 instead of a 1, but only because 5-year-olds might be able to enjoy it.  Provided they aren't particularly discriminating.  And even to them, I would point out that they can still catch reruns of the original show for free.",Scooby-Doo

I absolutely hated this movie!!!!!!!! In my opinion, the only good acting ability, was Sarah Michelle Geller (i think that's how you spell it) as Daphne. Never seen Buffy, never seen The Grudge.

Well unless the respect the original traits. What really annoys me is that there are a good amount of scenes where they just ignore the original character and annoy many scooby fans. The acting is well.....some performances is acceptable while others make you laugh at how over acted it is. The sets though are actually creepy, like the abandoned ride scene was like walking into a Tim Burton dream. Although the sets are cool, it wasn't enough to save this film. The cgi for the monster( though I don't really care about effects) are bad, just 1 ugly design. Also I guess this could give away the movie a bit but I think it can slide. You see the shadow of he creepy clown looking monster? Oh you saw I'm in the trailer? Guess what? First 15 mins and he's caught. Then why is he on the front cover you may ask? Well because the real villains are well.....not what fans wanted. That's all I'm going to say, I think it is a pretty bad movie, and I would've given it a 3, if it weren't for those sets.

Scarred by my previous experience from the last movie, I was reluctant to see this film however it did not disappoint. In this review, I will look at the good and bad points.Good points are the film has lots of Mr Bean, there is no female shaggy, scrappy remind me of my wife when we first met. Bad points are that at not point in this movie are monsters unleashed, there is no scenes that contain potions that turn Scooby into a slug. Oh sugar! another good point is that there is another plot twist that the main bad guy is someone that they are not, initially Mr Bean who turns out to be Scrappy Doo. This left me and my wife gasping as to why this happened which lead to a passionate evening and lets just we were screaming scooby dooby doo. More Bad points include that there is no tits, (male or female). In the scene where daphney in wrestling, there is a no penetration and b there is no Mortal Kombat style brutality! In this film, velma loses her glasses but in an adaptation I watched on an adult channel, her glasses were found on another man's part, this left me thoroughly disappointed!!! Another bad point, is that fred does not remove his ascot from neck whereas in monsters unleashed he does and damn son that is a beautiful neck! Oh beans! Another good point, oh wait! I mean a bad point is that at no point in the film does Fred say ""Split up and look for clues"" However (this is a good point as the film appeals to a LGBTQaudience as velma teams up with Scooby and Shaggy instead of the typical Velma, Daphney and Fred original trio which portrays Fred as a rampant sex criminal as he is surrounded by two women!!!!",Scooby-Doo
274,legendNYC,Better than expected,8,12 June 2002,"We got the chance to see a preview last night. From the trailers I thought that I would have to grind my teeth and endure the pain while my son, age 10, enjoyed himself.  We both had a great time! The actors are dead-on and flesh out the cartoon characters quite well.  The action is fast paced and the humor is consistent.  There are some gross jokes, but I think artistic license is allowed and helps make the transition to the big screen. Recommended to kids and parents alike. My rating: 8 (***)",Scooby-Doo
275,jdhannan,98.5 / 100,8,22 June 2002,"This was a great movie.  Matthew Lillard IS Shaggy.  Velma was very good. If you're too familiar with the cartoon you may notice that Fred and Daphne were both cast terribly, and dressed wrong.  The scene in the airplane, Scooby barks like a real dog and he looks like he's made out of Jello(tm). His head moves independent of his nose!  The only other scene i had a problem with was the farting contest between Shaggy and Scooby.  The rest of the movie was pure bliss.  Great story, great graphics, Shaggy, Velma and Scooby more than make up for Freddie Prinze and Sarah Gellar's bad work.",Scooby-Doo
276,maniacmajic,This Film is Lame,1,18 July 2002,"Do Not see this film! Apologies if you are hopping, surfing or whatever the word is for reading this page to give this a glorious 2 thumbs up or a 10/10 mark this review is not for you!However if like me the bile that has built up inside you, days after the accursed event has reached boiling point and you feel that you must reach out to the world and cry ""SCOOOOOBYYY DON'T"" then this might be slightly more your cup of tea.First I would just like to point out that this film has NO FUN in it whatso ever.It is unfunny, horribly acted, bad plot and just about the only good thing that happened was that it ended. Oh and that it was half as long as Lord of the Rings.In fact the only fun that might be even dared to be thought up in conjunction with this unspeakable waste of life is tricking your mate into wasting however long (S)he can stand to remain inside a dark,dank grottoesque hellhole surrounded by hordes of no-longer screaming pre pubescent little horrors, who bored out of their witt's end rely on drinking far too much cola in order that they can leave whichever (soon to be ex best mate's great party idea it was to take his friends to see a once proud and noble cartoon, the stalwart of the cartoon network portrayed like a picasso, lude crude and nothing like the original) that they may spend a blessed few minutes relieving themselves before the ordeal starts againAfter some father/Mother dragged a kid to see this epic of rectal proportions I can fully understand the idea of parental divorce.Thank you for reading and may your life be blessed with the hope that you may never encounter such a villainous waste of £5.50.I am off to ritually cleanse myself by watching Battlefield Earth and Tomb Raider so that my memories may no longer be tainted by such things as Sara Michelle Gellar trying to be anything other than Buffy.. or that nice pretty young thing she played in Cruel Intentions.",Scooby-Doo

280,hardy_fan_2Xtreme,"An entertaining, yet sometimes lame, movie",10,16 June 2002,"From the comments I've read here about Scooby-Doo, it seems as if people were expecting the movie to be a spectacular work of art. You've got to remember that this is a movie aimed for children and, to an extent, teens. Now, I'm 14 and I enjoyed Scooby-Doo. I don't know, maybe it's just because I'm crazy for everything Matt Lillard because he's one of my favorite actors. Oh, and speaking of Matthew, he was dead-on as Shaggy. I can't express in words how awesome he was. The animated Scooby was impressive, and a few times, I actually started to believe that Scooby was a real dog...until I came back to reality. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments, but nothing to rave about. Matt stole the movie, hands down. The other performance that I liked was Linda Cardellini's Velma. She did a very good job of looking and acting like the character: the way she spoke, the way she talked, and I'm impressed with the fact that she chopped off her super-long locks to have the real helmet hair. As you can probably tell, I've been telling my friends that Matthew and Linda are the best parts of the movie.A few complaints, though. Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred? Although it wasn't a terrible casting decision, I wouldn't call it a good one either. Either he didn't do anyone research on the role as his close friend and co-star, Matt, did, or he just didn't have the knack to play the character. And can I just say that his blonde hair looked horrible. Sarah Michelle wasn't bad as Daphne and her goal to be the one who saves the day is a cute little addition. As for Shaggy's ""love interest,"" Mary Jane? I wasn't into the story. But, Matthew did a good job of making that subplot as entertaining as it could get. The actually mystery that the gang is supposed to solve made me wonder what the writers were smoking until I realized that this is Scooby-Doo and they're supposed to run into all this weird stuff. And I've got one more complaint. Two words: Scrappy Doo. That idea was just out of nowhere and pure crap.
Anyway, call me crazy, but I would pay to see the movie a second time, but only to see Matthew and Linda's performances again. And, again, call me crazy, I will be buying the movie when it comes out on DVD. I'd give the movie 7.5/10 stars. If you're deciding whether to watch it, I would recommend it.",Scooby-Doo
281,msoren,This movie made me very glad inside when watching it. Great actors!,9,3 August 2003,"This movie made me feel really happy while watching it and also after it was done I was smiling.The 4 main actors are all great actors with a common chemistry.Many people says that Scooby looked too computer made... So what? He is a cartoon dog from the begining. How cool would it have been if they took an ordinary bulldog or something? No, I like him. He and Shaggy were a cool couple!",Scooby-Doo
282,nikadimez,Quite funny and entertaining...,7,16 June 2002,"Took my 5 year old daughter (the movie nut) and wasn't bad not the greatest, but not bad either. However if your the type of parent that is offended or disgusted with a parady that plays on flatulence or belching (like my wife), then I would not recommend going. Not that there is a lot, just one scene, but its quite a scene. I thought it was funny, haven't scene a flatulence scene like it since Blazing Saddles.I have to hand it that Matthew Lillard really pulled off Shaggy perfectly and the movie was basically like watching one of the cartoons.  Besides Scooby and Shaggy, Velma was the next best character.  Freddy Prince Jr. as Fred though, I mean come on get a clue!  He's not beefy enough, and Fred never had any vanity issues.The Mystery Machine van was pretty cool, and all the old lingo from the toon was there, Zoinks, Jeegies, etc.  Go and have fun with it!",Scooby-Doo

Ok I am probably one of the biggest Scooby fan for my age that I know (Besides my 5 year old cousin:). The movie was wonderful! Exactly like the old cartoons.  Everyone played the part of their characters just as you would imagine. The only part I didn't like was how it was Scrappy who was trying to take over the world. Even though he was a bit annoying, you had to love him. That was the part that got me, but being a total Scooby fan, I give it a 10 out of 10! The real Scooby fan, Hermione",Scooby-Doo
284,Smartone22388,Pointless and a waste of time.,4,19 June 2002,"I am usually very generous in movie reviews but this flick deserves no generosity whatsoever.  I did not like this movie AT ALL!!!!!  Scooby's animation was okay but not the best.  Other things:Casting:Sarah Michelle Gellar~ Very talented actress, terrible part...I cannot see Sarah as Daphne at all I'm sorry.Freddie Prinze, Jr.~ It's good that they decided to put a real life relationship to Fred and Daphne but together they don't go very well on screen.Matthew Lillard~ He did a GREAT job with Shaggy!!!  Shaggy has to be the most difficult character to display for Scooby-Doo and he did a great job with the voice, expressions, and laugh too.Linda Cardellini~ Very attractive behind the actual face of Velma and she did a pretty good job portraying the character.Rowan Atkinson~ MR. BEAN AS A BAD GUY (sort of)...THAT'S SOME HILARIOUS CRAP!!!The voice for Scooby~ Great job!PLOT:As usual, Scooby and the gang get into a chase scene, some classic lines are put in and the most common line was said which is, ""And I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids and your stupid dog!""",Scooby-Doo
285,Daedo,A great nostalgic romp into the world of ScoobyDoo *Spoilers*,8,14 July 2002,"I went into the Scooby Doo movie with mixed feelings.  On one hand it was the first live action version of the movie, and as such the first PROPER Scooby movie, but on the other hand it had such terribly overhyped stars as Freddy Prinze Jr and Sarah Michelle Gellar.  Luckily however, I was not disapointed and found myself having fun throughout the movie.The plot opens up midway through a 'ghost hunt' in a toy factory, with the gang hatching a plan to catch the apparition.  Velma as usual comes through and the culprit is demasked as Old Man Swithers. ( I was so damn close in my estimation of Old Man Withers.  After all, isn't it ALWAYS an old man somebody or other?  After the arrest, and obligatory 'You damn pesky kids' speech, Fred takes all the credit for the plan and Velma has enough.   She leaes the group before everyone else quickly goes there seperate ways.Cut to two years later, and each of the ex-Mystery Machine crew receive an invitation to solve a mystery on Spooky Island, a theme park owned by the eccentric like Rowan Atkinson.  There the gang bands together once more and uncovers a plot to release the power of peoples souls to make one person all powerful.The acting for the most part is far from spectacular, with the aforementioned Gellar and Prinze really hamming up their roles of Daphne and Fred.  This however, is no bad thing as it adds to the whole 'classic' feel of the movie.  The star of the show however has to be Matthew Lillard, who steals the show as Shaggy.  Not content with being a spitting image of the lanky klutz, Matthew's voice mimics perfectly the original Shaggy's strained tones.The animation is great throughout, with Scooby, all the monsters and even Scrappy Doo making their appearance in all their CGI glory.   Many critics and other people have criticised the filmmakers for making Scooby look fake, but that's just it:  HE IS FAKE!  Scooby has always been a cartoon and trying to make him look realistic as possible would pull much of the fun away from the movie.  Anyways, it's pretty hard to get a real dog to skateboardalong a conveyorbelt with barrels and blades spinning all around.The humor of the film is, as always, very basic and comes in many forms, mainly slapstick.  In the cinema, people of all ages will be amused as there is even jokes for the adults spattered throughout.  It however, never gets too far gone as at it's heart this is still mainly a kid's movie.  There was one part of the movie, where I was the only person to laugh and that's because I pictured something else completely going in.  Scooby and Shaggy are in the Mystery Machine cooking burgers and we see the smoke rise from the roofof the van.  This alluded me to the Scooby scene in 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' where Jay pulls out his own unique 'Doobie Snacks'.Overall, this film should appeal to people of all ages, from veterans of the original 50's series to people who have only ever seen the film.  Be warned however, that watching this film will probably make you drop a couple of IQ points due to its simplicity.  Don't let this detract you however, as this is definitely THE family film of the summer.",Scooby-Doo
286,TheSausageKingOfChicago,What I think About Scooby Doo,5,9 June 2002,"I saw an advance screening of Scooby Doo. I watched the cartoon when i was small, and i really had hope in my heart for this movie. If you aren't 12yrs and under dont bother to see this movie. The humor of this movie has a childish tone to it and  the story is a bit weak but kids really dont know the difference so they will enjoy it. Everything I laughed at none of the kids in the room laughed at. Sarah, Freddie, Matt and Linda did a good acting job dont get me wrong here it was fairly entertaining but i could have seen better so for teens and adults this isnt worth 10 bucks. Wait till it comes out on DVD.Cameos by the band SUGAR RAY & PAMELA ANDERSON didn't help the cause. Scooby Doo's voice was well done. Over all I'd give Scooby Doo (2002) a 5 out of 10",Scooby-Doo
287,chguenette-1,A pleasant surprise,7,18 August 2002,"First of all, I admit that I am a Scooby-Doo fan. I really wasn't expecting much from this live action movie rendition of Scooby Doo, but ended up being pleasantly surprised with it. The plot is about on par with your average Scooby episode, but that's part of the charm of it. The characters were all pretty much true to form, with my main problem being the ugly Scooby they had. He just didn't look anything like the Scooby we all know and love. Sure, some of the jokes were a little crude, but it can be overlooked if you remember the show for what it was. Basically, if you're a Scooby fan, you'll probably enjoy it. If not, well, then you probably won't. 7/10",Scooby-Doo
288,Digitalimage,scoooby dpdooooo!!!,6,28 October 2002,Yes Scooby truly reigns supreme in this movie.The acting was hilarious and it's good to see heavy buffy in a lighter role.

289,aidanworsley,Utter doo doo?,4,28 November 2019,"Maybe Scooby Don't? Nothing much to recommend this. Shaggy works relatively well. And there are some attempts to give it a cartoon ethic. But, really it's just a bad movie.",Scooby-Doo
290,a-man-412-238911,A clever and funny satire,7,14 February 2013,"I remember seeing the first trailer to Scooby-Doo and thinking it would be a travesty. Then I saw the other trailers and they didn't help either,but after finally seeing the movie in theaters and again on home video. I came to a conclusion that Scooby-Doo is not a bad movie but a clever send up to the original series. The premise is that the mystery Inc. gang have broken up and gone there separate ways, but they are reluctantly paired up again to solve a case at a theme park in titled Spooky Island, which is like if Tim Burton took over Disneyland and made it his own. Now I know the characters are not as fleshed as they would in normal movie but what really works is the adult humor. This movie was clearly made for adults who grew up with the series and older teenagers who want to see a clever satire to the old show. I gotta admit I am a fan of old-school scooby-doo,so it was nice to see a movie that makes fun of it's self and yet homages it at every length. Now there are some obviously dumb moments like the cross dressing scooby and pointless celebrity cameo by Pamela Anderson but there are some generally funny moments, like when Fred is transformed into a hip-hop zombie, it's actually really funny to see Fred act like even more a tool than he usually is. The drunk Velma scene was very funny and surprising. Hell, even the evil plan is pretty f'upd, there plan is to to suck the souls out of a person, so a monster can climb into to there body and take over them,which is actually pretty neat. Scooby-Doo is in my opinion a first rate satire that honors the original show while making fun of it at the same time. For me it's a underrated classic.",Scooby-Doo

Mathew Lillard played an awesome Shaggy. But Sarah Geller as Dalphnie, not the best. Other than that The casting wasen't that bad.

293,yodapoo2000,Why?,1,16 February 2005,"this film leaves me asking one question, the one above funnily enough. it was shockingly bad on absolutely every level imaginable. they cant even scoop credit for the animation because it was crap. how they managed to pay Rowan Atkinson (thats Mr bean to you yanks) to degrade himself by having anything to do with this pile of erm... sh-t. furthermore i have often asked myself how they managed to get so many *cough cough* credible actors to *cough cough* star in this monstrosity. after racking my brain for almost 2 seconds, i concluded that they were paid nearly as much as the acting talent they possess, actually no. not only that but they also made a sequel. are they too stupid to learn from their mistakes? this movie was a mistake and watching it was a mistake. not killing myself after seeing it was a mistake. id rather give birth to a giant razor-blade through my rectum than be forced to watch this again.to be fair, though it didn't really have much to live up to, the cartoon was pathetic. in conclusion its a film for children. really really simple-minded children, and probably made by children with ""needs"" at gunpoint. watch only at your peril",Scooby-Doo
294,Mr_Kyleson,At least they got Scrappy right,3,15 March 2005,"The Gang split up, then are invited to Spookie Island to solve a case, and inevitably re-group again.It starts off okay in the beginning, right up to the point where Pam Anderson comes in driving the Mystery Machine. Then it all goes downhill.The sets were obvious, you could tell that the hotel was made from scratch by the various wood furniture, found in most normal 3 star hotels in the world. One would expect an island theme park hotel to be at least a LITTLE theme like.The actors were hammy, especially Freddie Prinze Jr., who practically murdered the character he was portraying, in fact, the only actors that were fairly good were Rowan Atkinson, who was already experienced with the kind of character he was playing from his career as Mr. Bean and his various comedy performances, and Matt Lillard, who actually preformed his own stunts.The other good points about the movie were the fairly good graphics of Scooby Doo and Scrappy, and Scrappy's few, but very good (and very funny) lines.Scooby-Doo is a good Kid's movie, but it may as well have been Scooby-Dumb and it wouldn't have made a difference.",Scooby-Doo
295,leighkaty,Oh My God!,1,21 December 2005,"This movie shouldn't even be allowed to be seen. Why is Freddie Prinze Jr. even alive? He has no talent what so ever all he is, is a f*king pretty face and he's not even that good looking. I love Matthew Lillard and he probably did the best job, but still this movie lacked everything that I stand for. I am more of an Indie movie girl, but I like to watch the main stream as well. AND I HATED IT. I give it 0 ZERO out of TEN stars. A waste of space. I could have made a better movie. I have seen enough kids movies (because i am bored out of my scull) and this one is stupid and pointless. I would be ashamed.

OK so maybe it's no shawshank but for a kids movie It's pretty enjoyable and as this was a childhood favorite of mine i felt it was my duty to defend it (along with it's sequel). Now as much as this film hits me with nostalgia i know it's not the only factor that makes me love this film. I re-watched part of spy kids 2 recently (which was another childhood fave of mine) and thought it was complete trash. I didn't feel this way about scoobs. The film does more than take a mediocre cartoon and and put real actors in it, if anything i would say the film is a parody of the show like the Brady bunch movie (though not to as much of an extent). It shows us mystery inc in today's environment and it makes them real adults. The film is genuinely funny to with plenty of adult humor (smoke pouring from the van while playing Rasta music only to be revealed as shaggy and scooby cooking was great) and all the slapstick humor isn't overly cringey. The casting is amazing, particularly for shaggy and velma. Fred does come off as a bit douchey though and scooby can sometimes get annoying. The climax is admittedly pretty awful and the films is packed with corny moments but i would be lying if i didn't say i loved it. I'm not saying this deserves to be 10/10 and i can understand why people don't like it but i don't think it deserves so much hate either. 7 zoinks out of jinkies.

I was always a Scooby-Doo fan of the animated series, and I think they did a good job with this movie, the plot was ok, I would have prefered something a bit creepier, but that's ok. I mean a haunted fun-house/island is pretty typical, there is only so much you can do with that. The special effects were great, and I really didn't think that I was going to like the digital Scooby, but I quickly warmed up to him, especially in some of the touching scenes between him and Shaggy. I do think that Daphne and Fred were mis-cast. I would have preferred to have seen Jennifer Aniston as Daphne, (she's got the Daphne voice too) and I have no idea who would be Fred, but anyone would have done better than Freddie Prinze Jr. The inside stoner jokes were funny too, as Shaggy's love interest was named Mary Jane and they played Pass the Dutchie when Shaggy and Scooby were cooking in the van (you could see smoke come out of the top).",Scooby-Doo

Matthew Lillard was perfect ion his role as ""Shaggy,"" and the rest of the characters did a pretty good job as well.  I have read several comments about this movie here on IMBD and I am baffled.

The acting for each character cannot really be judged because there was no way to match a living person with them, OOPS... I mean all but Matthew Lillard who was as close to Shaggy as can even be possible.  Scooby Doo at first seemed to be fake (how can they match up to OUR Scooby?!?!?) but within minutes he was just as real as the people playing their parts.  The hardest shoes to fill were those belonging to Velma...the animated version tried a little too hard to make her NOT Daphne... and Linda Cardellini made her someone you could see as a person and not just a walking computer with glasses.  Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. made Fred and Daphne belong to them.  I can say that I can't picture anyone else playing their parts.  Without giving away a part of the movie, there is a part in the movie that shows that they know each other very well in real life.  I guess I should take the end of this message to say that our boys just loved the movie to death and can't wait for Santa to bring them the DVD for Christmas. Now,  that shows that it was awesome if it was added to Santa's list before we could even get to our car after the movie.",Scooby-Doo
307,Desslar,Zoinks! Pretty good actually,7,16 April 2003,"I'm amazed and disappointed by all the negative reviews this film is getting.  What's the deal?  Sure it could have been better, but I think they did a pretty good job.  Is it true to the show?  Yes, a very accurate representation.  Matthew Lillard gives an Oscar worthy performance as Shaggy (he really nails the voice), and the rest of the gang is similarly well cast.  Is it funny?  Yeah, most of the time.  It's certainly more amusing than the show.  Some bits fall flat, but they are generally successful. The flatulence competition is a bit much, but it sets up a really funny gag in the next scene.The only legitimate complaint is that the film breaks the show's rule that the monsters are always fake.  The other-worldly nature of the villain's plot is a bit disconcerting, but it doesn't really detract from the movie's enjoyment.If you are a fan of the show, or even just a casual viewer, you should get a kick out of this.  I eagerly look forward to the sequel.  Scooby Snacks anyone?",Scooby-Doo
308,jwp6,Ruined by Pop Culture,1,18 June 2002,"Scooby Doo is the most loved cartoon of all time for most of us.  Warner Brothers absolutely destroyed the reputation of Scooby and the gang.  They have been tainted with the culture of the newest generation.  The movie was full of boring people and completely lacking of any mystery whatsoever. The ending was the worst ending ever, and to top it all off Scooby was designed by rejects with no imagination.  Biggest disappointment ever, this movie belongs on the worst 100 movies of all time.",Scooby-Doo
309,indigo997,Stay at Home,5,19 June 2002,"This movie is a little bit too much like the cartoon to suit me. Surprisingly, animated Scooby was pretty believable. There was about as much plot in this film as a 5 minute cartoon. Lillard was awesome as Shaggy, but the other characters were really 2 dimensional and boring. They should have either made a full length animation or actually let the actors be real people.",Scooby-Doo
310,robj-1,Lazy film making at it best,2,13 December 2002,This film was quite simply just lazy..the direction was poor..the CGI was rushed and just didn't fit...Shaggy was the only cast member to at least try and produce the original cartoon personna..the rest just turned up got paid HUGE sums of cash and buggered off without even bothering to act.  Isla Fisher looked cute..thank god for small mercies.,Scooby-Doo
311,Skungy_Jim,why does it deserve the bashing it gets,10,19 June 2002,"where too start scooby doo, is a fairly good movie for what it is - a live action reworking of the classic and loved cartoon.  i guess all the critisism comes from the classic old folks who grew up watching the classic cartonn when it started in the late 60's.  they are atacking this movie for everything it is worth when truth be know that this movie isn't made for them... it was made to recapture a new generation of scooby fans - not their naive parents  who slap this movie for its homosexual/lesbian subtext, its drug references and everything else about it (and i mean c`mon - people who watched this from the start in the 60's and 70's would've ben decencetised against all that stuff ages ago) another thing the critics bag out is the cast - sure i know Freddy Prinze Jr is bad, and i think people realise that he was chosen for his star power rather than his character motif.  Mathew Lillard was superb, nothing else can be said, Sarah Michelle Gellar was good - but i don't think it was a case of her lack of acting abilities, but more the lack of character material she could work with - Daphne was the babe of the show, not the brawn, not the brains, but the sex-on-legs type damsel in destress character - and her turn to super vixen was not very welcome... it was too...buffy. Linda Cardelinie was champion as were the compurot creators of scooby (scrappy was annoying) well thats it - think people ar eonly attacking it coz of its premise, nothing more",Scooby-Doo

Even though I love Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. I didn't think they could pull it off but they did, and It was great! Matthew Lillard was AWESOME as Shaggy and the voice he did was terrific. Linda Cardellini also did a great voice and out of all of the actors she did the best representation (right down the her actions when she lost her glasses). It was great also to know that after all the rumors - Scott Innes did the voice of Scooby-Doo (He has done most of the recent cartoon-movies and episodes) The best part of the movie is went they switch bodies for a few minutes (I'm not telling you how, or what happens but it's absolutely hilarious!) 10/10",Scooby-Doo

Scooby Doo was cute, and the guy who played Shaggy's voice was o.k., but that's all it had going for it!!  I enjoyed myself by ""snoring"" during the movie to irritate my friend and her girls!!

316,cgw-home,Spiderman goood Scooby doo baaad!,2,26 July 2002,"For the past 12 years me and a few of my closest friends have done very funny Scooby impressions whilst either being under the influence of various chemicals. Also my mate is a living version of shaggy. We are like just about every other Scooby fan that encouraged this film to be made. The problem is with this film is not the bad acting or cheesy dialogue. After all Scooby is based on that. I know it is a writer's job to research a film but they must have been really stoned to come up with the story line of this film. Shaggy stoned, not the writers. Not to give the film away. I can promise you that you will leave the cinema angry that they have betrayed the very basics of what Scooby is. This is a prime example of an over thought film. I was impressed with the Scooby and shaggy combo and convinced by the special effects but that is it. Anybody who is in their mid 20's grew up on Scooby snacks and a weird affection for the female characters (maybe only me then). I can't really complain as Spiderman, batman and superman (the three things I decided to be when I was four) have all been well done films. I pray that the incredible hulk will not fall into the trap of this film. The worst thing about the film is that I did not leave the cinema doing Scooby impressions and wanting Scooby snacks when I get home. I went to bed disappointed",Scooby-Doo

I loved the cartoons.But I hated the movie...I really wanted to like the movie.  I thought it sounded like a good idea at first.  Then I saw the previews.  Skipped it at the theater, dollar theater and video store.  I finally caught it on HBO the other night.Yikes.The only case Mystery Inc. should be investigating is how this movie got so uncontrollably bad.  I couldn't even stand to watch the whole movie.",Scooby-Doo
318,mishellasangel,Great movie but could have been better,8,7 June 2011,"I gave it an 8 because I just do not agree with scrappy being the bad Lil' guy... I know things changed up a bit, but I think they could have made a different story line than they did with this one. I felt that Matthew Lillard and Scooby were the best in this movie as they played their character to almost the exact. Although the farting was just for more entertainment which did get me going. Velma's character in here was played okay, I don't recall her being the emotional one but it was okay... Daphne and Fred were not what I expected, I think they could have made their character better, but they were not too bad... I found myself more attached to the younger versions of Scooby Doo the mystery begins and the curse of the lake monster, I think the gang in there were much more entertaining. I can tell they all were having fun with what they were doing too... I think overall I am glad they did start the Scooby doo series non cartoon so I do overall appreciate that which is why I didn't give it too low of a rating because it still was a fun movie.",Scooby-Doo

320,rob-pilcher,"Good, not great",7,22 March 2006,"Scooby Doo was, and still is, a cult icon. Nearly every person in the world knows of Scooby Doo the talking great Dane. The animated gang, Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and yes even Velma have already made movies. A lot. All fully animated, all quirky and all brilliant. Now they are hitting the big screen as real life characters. I think the cast is perfect. More than perfect. They wanted a real life coupe, a.k.a, Freddie Prinze Jr and Sarah Michelle Geller, to play Daphne Blake and Fred Jones. Velma's character is fab too, just like the real cartoon. Not to mention Shaggy, he is the most life like. You can tell from the beginning that this was a high cost movie. But worth it man, worth it. Not enough people went to see this film. It's a breakthrough. You might be wondering, he loves it, he thinks it's the best, so how come he gave it a 7 out of 10, and entitled his review good, but not great. Well, the actual film is not that fab, it's worth buying, but it's not something that you would really want to watch every day, or even every week. 7 out of 10 is a suitable grade for a film as technological as this. But the plot is a bit iffy. The second is better. Just look at my review for that one.",Scooby-Doo
321,richard_andmel,A real treat for Scooby fans!,9,12 July 2002,"This movie was fun right from the first minute. We really enjoyed it.

322,Cabbagehead,Discredit to the original,1,26 November 2002,"One of the great things about the original series is that the monster/alien/ghost/whatever was NEVER real.  It was always some guy playing an elaborate prank.  This got lost in the movie, sadly.  Scrappy Doo as a villain?  Hey, Scrappy sucked.  If anyone should have been a villain, it was him.  I loved this shot at his character.  However, SMG and FPJr. were nothing like the original characters.  Shaggy, Scooby, and Velma were all true to the original series.  You can really see Lillard trying his ass off to make it right.  Sadly, it doesn't ultimately work out.  Too many of the ""rules"" of the series have been broken to make it a good rendition of Scooby Doo.  SMG, FPJr., and the addition of real supernatural activity makes this a bad remake of a pretty good cartoon series.  Sadly, the target audience doesn't care or doesn't notice these problems.  Whatever.  This movie and its sequels can make millions 'til the cows come home.  It doesn't change the fact that they suck, and everyone who matters believes the same way.",Scooby-Doo

Anyone who grew up watching Scooby-Doo every week (or everyday, in my case) should love this movie! It follows the standard Scooby-Doo rules and plot line. Much of it is reminiscent of the old show, except that in this case many of the monsters turn out to be real. The gang has to solve a mystery at Spooky Island, a mysterious theme park. While they let their pride get in the way of their friendships for awhile, they finally come to their senses and realize that they must work together to solve the mystery.

Indeed, we speak of many of the great films and how we walk away from them with our perspectives changed and weltanschauung altered. With this movie was a rebirth of mine, especially my sense of humor, so profound, that it may be classified as a genesis. In an adjective, this movie is pulchritudinous.

It seems like the whole movie was just to show you that they could make the characters come alive. Not only the lack of back bone to the story, is the bad animated scooby itself.

330,clickgoal,"Decent film, Scooby and shaggy are brilliant but far too many 'jokes' that no one who'd watched the original cartoon would get.",8,20 June 2002,"Some Spoilers (albeit obvious ones) This film is clearly written by/for fans of the ORIGINAL cartoon and is full of nostalgia and nostalgic jokes, but this isn't to say it's bad. I remember the original cartoons and i love them dearly as brilliant entertainment, i too hate scrappy doo and anything which came later and i assume the writers of this film take the same view. Now, I enjoyed this film, whilst at the same time it annoyed me. I can't ever remember daphne being a female version of shaggy, but in this film this is exactly what she is. Fred is as boring as he was in the cartoon and Velma is spot on so congratulations to the makers for those two. Where this film really works is in the brilliant (i do mean brilliant) performance of Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, I've disliked him since i saw him in Hackers but I've got to admit he gets shaggy spot on and his stuff with Scooby Doo is very funny.This film isn't a updated version for todays kids, it's for anyone over the age of 16 who watched scooby doo as a kid and likes reminiscing of the good old days when childrens tv didn't involve pokemon and rugrats, this is one reason why this film could be criticised. They got the balance all wrong, this film really should have been aimed for kids but include a few jokes what would draw a laugh from the older crowd. They wrote the film for the 16-26 bracket, same bracket of audience who like teen movies but this teen movie replaces sex with a great dane. This i believe is a mistake.In general i liked the film, some things annoyed me, like when Fred and Daphne kiss at the end, there was no need for it! What fan of the original would like to see Shaggy get a girl friend, even if it is Isla Fisher! This whole film just has too much college feel and it's all wrong because it should be for kids and at times i cringed during it.I'd suggest people watch it because shaggy and scooby are just class, daphne is a joke but it is not Gellar's fault, the character has been wrote wrong and she's like a dizzy version of Buffy. If the producers could have got Daphne right and addressed the balance between entertainment for new scooby doo fans and old scooby doo fans then this film would have been brilliant, sadly they have put most of their eggs in the old boys basket and it might come back and haunt them.Rating 7/10 - I'm forgiving and to credit this film any less with the performance that Shaggy and Scooby put on would be criminal.",Scooby-Doo
331,akibukis,Worst movie ever,1,1 September 2007,"This is a complete disaster.Unnatural/bad acting (especially Shaggy), terrible CGI graphics integration. Original cartoon is dumb by default: every episode - all the same situation, but different decorations/monsters, but the movie ... I wonder how there are people who actually love the cartoon and especially - this movie.Unbelievable, that such good actress as Sarah Michelle Gellar doing in this flick. Even she is acting dumb, but I suppose, it's because of all other ""professionals"" in this movie. And this movie is even SCI-FI! Dooh!",Scooby-Doo
332,newsmickey,Entertaining!,9,15 June 2002,"I had to write mostly in response to all of the negative reviews that Scooby Doo has been receiving here. If you are inclined to see Scooby Doo, don't let any negative reviews turn you off to it.The cartoon series was never deep, but this movie does add some depth to the characters by exploring their relationships (as much as possible in what is essentially an action/comedy). The movie is aimed squarely at those who have grown up with all iterations of the cartoon. There are elements and plot devices taken from the original ""Scooby Doo Where Are You?"" as well as the cartoons with celebrity guest stars and the Scrappy Doo cartoons. It is cleverly devised to play on your fond memories of watching this stuff as a kid.That being said, it does pull out a few modern movie devices from the current state of its genre, which is hardly surprising. Fred and Daphne are reinvented slightly to create a group dynamic that fits the movie. Shaggy, Scooby, and Velma are exactly as you would imagine them. Shaggy and Velma are given expanded personalities in ways that work pretty well.  Shaggy's character in particular has a lot of heart, which holds the movie together very well.I honestly do not know what a six-year old would think of this movie, but I would recommend it to other Gen X'ers who grew up watching the cartoon when they came home from elementary school every day. If you liked the cartoon, you should find this movie fairly entertaining.",Scooby-Doo

While it is not truely the worst movie of all time (that right being explicity reserved for Tank Girl) it has been deemed worthy of a place in the top 10 all time bad movies in my book.The plot...doesn't even classify as stupid...it's clear that the scriptwritters sent this sucker around in an ""add a page and pass it along"". So first, we have a fairly classic Scooby Doo setup, with the bungled capture of the bad guy...only updated with bubble gum pop chase music? We then find out that Fred isn't realy the leader, but a big-headed-air brained narcissius?  Daphney is an idiot (ok..that translates well).  Velma is some sort of stuck up MIT grad? And of course Shaggy and Scooby are pot-heads.RIIGHT...The gang breaks up...and in under five minutes gets back together?  The island is haunted by demon-bugs bunnies who suck the souls out of kids and then use their bodies to rule the world?  All the while pumping out today's pop hits?RIIGHT....And what's the frigging deal with Scrappy Doo?  Yes he's annoying as all geddout, but he's not potty trained to boot?  And he's a diabolical mastermind?RIIGHT....Well the bottom line is unless you're desperatly searching for the worst movies made in the past decade...Scooby doo should be left off any rental list.  If you are looking for the absolute worst movie made in the past 10 years...Check out Tank Girl.  It's truely deserving of a sequil.Jason",Scooby-Doo

339,ChrisKorea,Hard to dislike,7,12 August 2002,"Let's make one thing clear: this is a film for kids or for adults who want to pretend they are kids for a couple of hours. If you are a 20- or 30-something for whom Scooby Doo was a part of your childhood you will love seeing the classic cartoon turned into a glossy and slick movie, which unashamedly gets most of its laughs by good-natured mocking of the original material. Mostly the film is true to the cartoon (except for the monstrosity of an ending - more on that later) and the attention to detail - the clothes and the voices of the main characters in particular - is hugely satisfying for those seeking a step back in time. It's utterly inane - in other words, exactly what it should be. It's also terrific fun!BIG SPOILER!Now - my one complaint, albeit a big one. This is a major spoiler so stop here if you haven't seen it. Put simply:YOU CANNOT DO THAT TO SCRAPPY DOO!I know I am not alone in thinking that Scrappy was the best thing about the original Scooby series. I always missed him in the episodes he wasn't in. I realise the movie makers wanted to surprise us, but this was going way too far. I mourn Scrappy's soiled reputation and shudder to think that an entire generation will now think of him as an evil egomaniac. Curse you Hollywood!Anyway, rant over, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Special kudos as ever to the fantastic Matthew Lillard, who seems to have studied the character of Shaggy to absolute perfection, and to the animators responsible for a superb Scooby. Also, for someone who was following Aussie soaps at the same time as he was the original Scooby, it was good to see some familiar faces popping up - Isla Fisher of Home and Away fame gives a suitably perky performance as dream-girl-possessed-by-scaly-monster, and - could it be? - yes! the boy with the spiky hair is none other than Kristian Schmidt, or Todd-from-Neighbours - very exciting if you were 10 years old in late 1980s Britain...Thank you to all concerned for helping me relive my childhood. But I still don't forgive you about Scrappy.",Scooby-Doo

Daphne Ann Blake is not supposed to be a kick butt girl nor never smart that is what Velma Dace Dinkley is for...with Daphne taking over that role Velma has no place to fit in. As for Scrappy-Doo he would never do this to his uncle Scooby, he looks up to him way to much. Also the animation of Scooby was poorly done... but all in all a good attempt but still not good.

345,Unknown__,Scooby Doo 3,10,18 November 2005,"Scooby Doo 3 Even if people say that they should stop making movies like Scooby Doo they're wrong and they should make a Scooby Doo 3. The reasons are that movies like Spiderman 3 aren't that exciting. Whats the plot anyway? Also the first Scooby Doo was a big hit it made more that 50 million dollars. And Scooby Doo is a classic funny cartoon from the 90's.Freddie Prinze Jr, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini , Matthew Lillard are great actors. I think if they ever make a Scooby Doo 3 they should be included. Freddie Prinze Jr as Fred makes a great Fred, although he was too dramatic. rating on Freddie as Fred is 8. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne acted great, except she pretty much acted the same as Buffy. rating on Sarah as Daphne is 9.5 Linda Cardellini as Velma acted great!rating on Linda as Velma is 10 Matthew Lillard as Shaggy acted well, but I am sure the director could of found somebody much better.rating on Matthew as Shaggy is 7.5 The movies Scooby Doo 1 and 2 were awesome. But Scooby Doo the movie didn't relate to the cartoon series but it was better than the second one. I rate it a 10. Scooby Doo 2 pretty much was like the series and I liked it.But I think the perfect title should be Scooby Doo 2: Monsters United. I rate it a 9.5. All of the Scooby Doo Movies were cool and I especially think THERE SHOULD BE A SCOOBY-DOO 3 !!!",Scooby-Doo

IMDb is making me type 10 lines but that about sums it up. Ugh YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THIS PART: It's so awesome, it's like awesome because of the actors, the voices just everything is perfect in this movie, it's just a classic and I just introduced this movie to my three year old cousin and he's hooked just like I was!

348,robbywilson,The best live action film ever made.,10,1 February 2019,This film is absolutely the best work of art ever put to the screen. The acting. The writing. The direction. The sound design. The sets. The use of CGI. This film is a magnum opus that absolutely blows other films out of the water. Rumor has it I was only at .003% power when I conceived the concept for the story. If I used anymore it would be too complex for you mere mortals to comprehend with your small intellects.,Scooby-Doo
349,robbywilson,My magnum opus.,10,1 February 2019,This movie is an absolute masterpiece all the jokes will make you cry laughing.They tell me I had to have used my full power to create this film. If I did that you mortals would not be able to perceive the excellence. The truth is I could only use roughly .003% of my power to create this film. In using this small amount of power I made the dicrector appear out of thin air along with the entire cast and crew but when that had happened the film was immediately completed and now those people I created move along in an empty life knowing that I created them and could just as easily destroy them with even less power.,Scooby-Doo
350,trax,I liked it!,10,19 June 2002,"I was glad I went to see it before reading the reviews.  I enjoyed the movie, it had the look and feel of the cartoon.  There was a lot of laughter from people in the audience, kids loved it.  As previously stated by others, Shaggy was right on and Fred was completely off.  I can understand why some people would hate it, I just can't understand why they went in the first place.  I mean if your looking for a deeper mystery, go and see ""The Bourne Identity.""  After all, this is a kid's movie based on a kid's cartoon.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out.",Scooby-Doo

It was very much like watching an 90 min or so episode of Scooby-Doo, but with characters that are really cheesy. The only two characters of the Mystery Inc. team that I thought were good was Shaggy and Scooby. The CGI for Scooby was fantastic. The soundtrack was great. The major let down of the film was the lousy ending. How on earth could they make Scrappy-Doo evil???? It just isn't right! Sure he was always the one of the two dogs that wanted to be in the action but couldn't because he was so small and the rest of the gang didn't want him to get hurt, but calling him a dog with 'thyroid problems'??? Please......get real director! Scrappy-Doo was never evil! How could you?????",Scooby-Doo
352,scooblover,"ok, not great, good for kids",7,16 June 2002,"Only people like me, the true Scooby fan, could think this movie could have been better. It had a pretty good storyline, considering it can't be easy to turn what would usually be a half hour show into an hour and a half long movie. some of the characters, i could completely see as the cartoons becoming real people. freddie prinze jr., i wasn't sure about as i went into the theater. But when i got to watching it, I realized that that was completely how fred would be if he was real: egotistical, god's greatest gift in his mind, etc. sarah michelle gellar did an ok job, but that character just wasn't daphne. linda cardellini was good as velma, but again, that character just wasn't quite velma. matt lillard did great as shaggy, even with the voice. i hope casey kasem is proud of the good job matt did, since casey's shoes can't be too easy to fill. scott innes, the guy who voices scooby on all the new scooby movies that are coming out on video, is ok, but not great. didn't he ever watch scooby? if he did, he would know scooby doesn't start every word with an r. anyway, the plot was cute, some of the characters were true to the show, while others could have been a little better. the villain is hilarious. all in all, it's decent, even to a die hard scooby person like me. and by the way, the references to shaggy being a pothead are SOOOO not nice!",Scooby-Doo

I think the filmmakers were satisfied that they could create a CGI Scooby and get the actors to look like the characters and that's it. Next time, how about a decent plot and dialogue, guys? And would it kill you to have one scene where Scooby makes his sandwich too big and has to tie a string around it to fit it in his mouth?",Scooby-Doo
357,wighthunter,It was good,10,9 March 2020,My absolute favorite part was when velma got kidnapped by those giant monsters but the thing I noticed was velma was in a skirt and when the monster picked her up her legs were open which is something you don't do while wearing a skirt I thought she would be smarter than that but it was funny when she lost her glasses and that monster gave them back to her but of course just because she had no glasses the monster took advantage of the fact that she can't see without her glasses,Scooby-Doo

Now, from the ""adult"" perspective, this is a pretty okay movie!  Shaggy is the best in this one!  The ending was very surprising and delightful!

I couldn't associate her with Daphne at all, and I kept having to do double takes.Having said that, the movie is a great laugh, and I'm ashamed to have put off watching it for so long. it's an excellent up-to-date live-action version of the show. *Don't* go expecting a remastered SD cartoon episode (who would sit for 2 hours through one of those, anyway?), and you'll enjoy the mix of slapstick and adult humour.Go see it!",Scooby-Doo

I went into the cinema expecting a lot worse and was very pleasantly surprised. It stays close enough to the scooby doo vibe to be convincing and doesn't take itself seriously. The characters are treated with warmth and nothing to much is done to the story line. There are certain aspects that you will only get if you are at least a bit of a fan, but I went to see it with two friends that weren't and they had a good time. If you hate scooby doo though definitely do not go and see it ( i guess that's pretty obvious). Basically it was great fun.",Scooby-Doo

370,markutb,Horrible Rendition,3,28 November 2008,"This was pitiful. I really like the old animated series and as much as the commercialism over the years has soured the image of young sleuths. I felt that it came to pinnacle in this sub-par stab at cashing in on a younger crowd. My favorite character has always been Shaggy and I HATED the actor they found for him. Plus I think that the CG dog kinda spoiled the whole experience even further. Anyways, the plot is pretty lame and the acting is quite poor. There doesn't seem to be any redeeming qualities about this title, with the exception of Daphne's gorgeous body.Hollywood needs to adopt a ""Live and Let Die"" mentality and just stop remaking old shows that don't transfer well onto the silver screen.",Scooby-Doo
371,amanojacu,Worst movie of the summer,1,26 June 2002,"I used to love sitting in front of the TV as a child and watch the Scooby Doo cartoons. Hoping that this movie might be successful where other cartoon remakes have failed (Josie, Dudley Do Right, Howard the Duck, Rocky & Bullwinkle), it wasn't.This is the worst movie I have seen all summer. If you want to take your kids to a good movie, take them to see Lilo and Stitch or the upcoming Spy Kids 2. I am willing to bet that not only will they enjoy these movies more, you will too.So why do I think it is so bad??? A lot of people have been bashing the actors. I think they probably did the best they could with a lousy script and directing. The CGI was horrible. I found myself so bored with this movie that all I could do was sit and find flaws to keep myself entertained. Daphne's feet disappear into a CGI floor during one of the scenes. In another scene she is running up a flight of stairs in tennis shoes and when she jumps down she is in go-go boots. How can you miss things like this?
Many of the scenes are pointless and just filler (the fart contest, Sugar Ray, etc). This movie could have been 30 minutes long and you would get just as much out of it, if not more.People have said ""Watch it for what it is or don't go in with high expectations"". When people spend anywhere from $7 - $12 to see a 90 million dollar film - their expectations should be high. If you take the family, it will cost $30 - $40 with tickets and popcorn. So take my advice - if you really want to see this, wait till it's on video. Save your money for something worthwhile.",Scooby-Doo
372,destinys_chai,Day 3: Seen it twice,10,16 June 2002,"It's been out for three days and I've seen it twice.  Never before have I seen the same movie in a theater more than once.  Matthew Lillard is *fabulous* as Shaggy, they could have not have casted a better actor; Linda Cartellini has her characters voice down as well.  I loved Sarah Michelle Gellar's sassy and black-belted Daphne, and Freddy Prinze Jr. did very well as Fred. Seriously here folks, this movie seems to have a really bad pre-reputation. It could not have been better.  Yes, they may have four well-known actors, but after seeing the movie it was not soley to rake in the cash from their reputations.  They are all extremely GOOD; the cast could not have been better.  I have found that there are the different depths of humor, the obvious cartoonish humor that always gets the kids, but there is also a lot of humor in the dialogue that will get the teenagers and older. I would reccommend anyone give this movie a chance!  Especially if you loved the cartoon!",Scooby-Doo

The kids don't need to hear people talking like them to enjoy it.find the southpark episode where Korn are the guests and they do a Scoody-Doo spoof.  Kids and adults can have fun with that. This movie does nothing it tries well.  limit the scope, shorten the movie, do a few things well.This could have been a franchise like Austin Powers.  Now it is another black eye for Raja.",Scooby-Doo

When I heard Sarah Michelle Gellar was going to be in it, I was even more excited since I am a big fan of both.  But this isn't the reason why I liked the movie.  This movie had great casting.  All of the actors played their roles to the fullest, making this good. While watching it, I had many laughs.  Many people don't want to admit that they didn't laugh, but I bet they did.  Scooby was realistic, even though at times he seemed faked, but people did a good job creating him.  All characters had great chemistry with Scooby, it actually looked like they were handling a real dog.  This is a good movie that everybody can enjoy, it has a unique plot, good casting, many laughs, and excellent effects.  If you are a Scooby fan check this movie out, if your not, you'll still enjoy it. A very funny movie for all ages!",Scooby-Doo

Matthew Lillard is brilliant as Shaggy (how is that possible?  His impersonation skills were flawless!).  The cartoonimation of Scooby and Scrappy Doo were interesting but were so 3-D rendered that they did not match the original 2-D versions very well.  The plot was reasonably interesting and twisted.  No mere disgruntled janitor in a spooky disguise-- there's some evil genius at work. There were some minor plot issues with Velma, Fred, and Daphne having much greater insecurity issues than in the cartoons, but experimenting with such ideas is very cartoon-like.  The set and cast worked very well.  There's some biological humor with Shaggy and Scooby that I did not expect, but the last bit that they did helped.  If you're prudish about gas-passing and belching, there are about 4 minutes you can do without, but they seem very much in character.",Scooby-Doo
379,rswonger,"A few funny bits, but overall poorly done",2,17 June 2002,"This movie commits the fundamental error of discarding the premise of the TV show on which it was based. By making the monsters real and the friends bicker, Scooby-Doo (the movie) loses the nostalgia and campiness that has made Scooby-Doo (the TV show) a favorite for decades.The actors do well with the material they were given. The plaudits for the character of Shaggy are well deserved. But, is there really a point to making Fred a vain, self centered air head? To transforming Daphne into a martial arts expert? To replacing Velma's nerdy self confidence with an ""I just wanna be liked by the cool kids"" self pity?My 7-year-old daughter put it best, saying that the opening vignette (a mini-adventure unmasking a ""ghost"" in a toy factory) was better than the rest of the movie.

Everybody's saying the CG Scooby was poorly done, but wouldn't it also look bad for a guy in a Scooby suit to do it instead??

There were plenty of the ""good"" Scooby cartoons to see instead of.But coming out with a movie, the last thing you do is make it political. It made the movie suck. The beginning was good up until Pamela Anderson showed up. Then all pretentious hell broke loose. Fred became an egomaniac. Daphne became a full time PMS queen. Velma revealed her inferiority complex. And Scooby and Shaggy duked it out.COME ON FOR CHRISTS SAKE!! It takes real talent to bring the magic of a cartoon to the big screen. And that didn't really happen here. Prinze Jr. was the way wrong guy for the part. As individuals, the scooby gang were plain, ordinary type people. Together they were a unique and exciting team. In the movie, too much emphasis was put on each character which made them very superficial and fake. I believe the only two that did the parts justice were Shaggy and Velma. But they needed a better producer with a good script, with love and respect for the original Hanna Barbara episodes, NOT Warner Brothers.Common sense is easy.

But the most important thing to me was that my children loved it too. My children own the first season of the original Scooby Doo and they loved recognizing the cartoon villains in this movie. My children are also fans of ""What's New Scooby Doo"" as am I. My point is that the changes made here and there for the film are not deal breakers. We're still huge Scooby fans.

The worst thing about the movie is that I couldn't suspend my disbelief in the story being told thanks to the worst CGI I've ever witnessed. I mean it is unbelievably bad, almost like they grafted in images from the original Castle Wolfenstein game.As a result every time a human being interacted with a monster or Scooby it just looked ridiculous. It felt like the actor was interacting with the air. I would have been better by far to simply have had costumes and make up.The unfortunate part is this overshadowed everything else, even the good things, like Lillard's near perfect Shaggy.",Scooby-Doo
392,stellardad,Hollywood hates natural blondes,1,29 March 2013,"Rarely do I see a blonde character actually cast to a blonde actor. Freddy as Fred is simply awful. In comparison to the cartoon, Fred is scrawny and you can see the dark roots in his eyebrows. This is so so low-rent. The casting is totally typical Hollywood. That's my chief beef. If the rest of the movie was decent, I'd not written this review, but being as p-o'd as I am after wasting a perfectly-good 89 minutes of my life, I couldn't resist the opportunity to rip this piece of junk another one.Freddy as Fred is simply awful. In comparison to the cartoon, Fred is scrawny and you can see the dark roots in his eyebrows. This is so so low-rent. The casting is SO, SO typically Hollywood.",Scooby-Doo
393,raiseman,How can you hate this movie,10,3 February 2019,This movie should be considered a classic in American cinema. Come on people Matthew Lillard is a pillar of this cinematic experience!,Scooby-Doo
394,hotdogdoni,great film,10,21 June 2013,This movie was a brilliant and epic film.The cast was pretty good.I would think that this movie got 4.8 stars cause adults reviewed not kids.The movies story was cool and funny.This movie always makes me feel better.And the awesome fight scenes.And this movie had such a nice ending.Great film for all ages.Without a complain this was the best movie of the summer.The mystery gang were like superheros.The story was great and funny with some violence but still a funny and super great comedy in the world.I loved the gang and all the cool fun characters that played in this great funny super movie.I loved how they turned the animated show into a real life movie.,Scooby-Doo
395,harry-millichamp,CGI Scooby left me howling with laughter,10,27 July 2005,"When I saw a trailer for Scooby Doo the Movie, I kid you not everyone in the cinema collectively groaned. A film of Scooby Doo? With a CGI Scooby? And Buffy?Still part of me was tempted - what could be funnier than a talking dog?Holy cow it was hilarious - Shaggy and Scooby MAKE this film. They are both perfect. The tone does start to grate after a while - it could have done with being about 30 minutes shorter, but apart from that it was a real pleasant surprise.Zoiks!",Scooby-Doo
396,edo-sofic,Hidden stoner movie gem,6,6 October 2018,"It's been 16 years since this movie came out, and I decided to watch it after browsing the Netflix library while being high. I was looking for the dumbest possible movie to watch, and thought Scooby Doo should do. Boy, like, how wrong was I? Never knew this was actually a stoner movie. I think it's silly enough to be fun if you watch it sober, but if you're high - it's awesome. Just stack up on scooby snacks and enjoy the ride!",Scooby-Doo
397,dathstroke,A truly amazing movie that is years ahead of its time,10,2 February 2019,Anyone who would rate this movie anything other than a perfect 10/10 should be ashamed. I am absolutely appalled by this improper rating behavior.,Scooby-Doo
398,actor_imdb2016,"No, no and No",2,28 October 2019,Such a bad movie! The only thing that was right was the casting!,Scooby-Doo
399,panasonic_youth,More awful than I remembered.,1,20 August 2021,"My child just recently discovered this horrendous movie.A reminder that Freddie Prince Jr was the worst actor of his generation, and his wife wasn't much better.Beyond terrible. I'll be stoked if I never have to see this again.",Scooby-Doo
400,mansenglund,Stands the test of time!,10,18 November 2020,Like a fine wine it just gets better! From the jaw dropping cgi to the oscar worthy performance from Rowan Atkinson. This is a must see for people in all ages.,Scooby-Doo
401,sivange,Gods work,10,31 January 2019,"I really enjoy this movie, as it is the best movie i've ever seen. Truly a work of art.",Scooby-Doo
402,nadinelockett,My Favourite Comfort Movie!,10,11 July 2021,This movie is the one I put on when I'm having a bad day or I'm feeling down. It always manages to cheer me up. A stellar cast!,Scooby-Doo
403,semtexgs,A movie for intellectuals,10,24 January 2018,"The Scooby Doo movie is perfect in every single way. I can't fault it in any way other than that the run-time isn't 24 hours because I would watch this and only this every day for the rest of my life. From the marijuana references to the bouncing scoobles to the hilarious animation to the childish jokes, it's just the pinnacle of entertainment. Favourite movie ever. I just wish the second movie was as great but it just doesn't seem to have the same flare. I hope this movie gains a cult following akin to the Room and is played in cinemas regularly.The 2002 Scooby Doo Movie Fanatic",Scooby-Doo
404,elaxson,BEST MOVIE,10,19 April 2018,Ten out of ten would recommend. This movie is the shoot.,Scooby-Doo
405,kevinthegarty,INCREDIBLE,10,14 August 2018,"This may just be the most underrated movie of all time and I think it's comedy is on another level. The jokes are funny for the whole family and the acting is Oscar worthy. For those who disagree, that's okay but it shows me u have absolutely no class.",Scooby-Doo
406,pyrolol-30261,Saved my life,10,31 January 2019,"This has the makings of a masterpiece, nothing bad can be said about this film",Scooby-Doo
407,gillou-71414,Meme movie,10,4 February 2019,It's a meme ... So it's obviously the best movie ever,Scooby-Doo
