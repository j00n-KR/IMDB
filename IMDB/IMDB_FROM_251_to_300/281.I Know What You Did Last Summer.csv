0,Leofwine_draca,Botched slasher from one-hit wonder Kevin Williamson,2,4 August 2016,"I borrowed I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER from a friend. I had been tempted to actually buy it when I saw it in the shops but I'm so glad I waited now, as it turned out to be one of the most boring hour-and-a-half's that I have ever sat through. Maybe the film wasn't bad in terms of production, but it's certainly a below average slasher film, lacking none of the extravagance or finesse of the '80s slashers (hardly any blood is shed, the murders are all quick and cut away from the gore). The film could easily have been cut down half an hour, which would not have harmed it - in fact it might have been better.The cast is full of American teenagers, a typical staple of the slasher film, but none of the actors and actresses are up to scratch. Jennifer Love Hewitt is more adept at showing her cleavage than emoting, while Sarah Michelle Gellar (star of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER) is an annoyingly whiny character. Ryan Phillipe is okay as the drunkard Billy, while the character of Ray remains largely undeveloped (and it's difficult to fathom his sudden role as an action hero at the finale). Anne Heche also turns up, in a thankfully small role.The murderer is a generic villain, and not in the least bit scary. Candyman used a hook for murders years before this, so where's the originality? There is none. The music is good in the stalking sequences but too full of hip pop songs (sadly commonplace these days). A lot of the film is pretty by-the-numbers stuff, which looks nice but lacks substance. The chase scenes are the only worthwhile parts of the film, and even these aren't too exciting. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is an example of the modern horror film, clichéd, derivative, and unfortunately not very exciting at all. A botched attempt, which proved that Kevin Williamson really was a one shot wonder.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
1,SnoopyStyle,Reasonable teen slasher movie,6,11 July 2014,"During the 4th of July holidays, four teens Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry William Cox (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) are driving after drinking on the beach. Barry distracts Ray as he runs over a guy on a desolate road in the middle of the night. They argue convincing Ray to dump the body. Max (Johnny Galecki) drives by but Julie lies to him. The body has a hook for a hand but he's not actually dead as he makes a final grab at Helen. The friends agree to keep it a secret after dumping him in the harbor. Then one year later, Julia comes back to town from college and she gets a note with ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!"" Helen is working for her sister Elsa and broken up with the jerk Barry. Barry suspects Max as the one who wrote the note. Ray is now a fisherman following his father's footsteps.The movie has some of the best young actors of Hollywood at the time. Kevin Williamson works over the script. It's a pretty simple teen slasher movie. It has some psychological aspects and mystery of the note. In the end, it's slash and splat. It works well and gets a couple of passable scares. It never really gets truly gritty or realistic. It's just an old fashion slasher flick. It's all about the old fashion 80s kills.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
2,Sleepin_Dragon,A great slasher movie,8,26 January 2018,"The Mid to late nineties was a great time for those that loved Slasher movies, Scream seemed to reignite a forgotten genre, many followed. One of the best that came in my opinion was I know what you did last Summer. On paper it sounds like all the rest, group of kids on the run from a mad man in a costume with a deadly weapon. There is however a whole lot more to this movie, firstly the direction, I'm watching this twenty years on, and I can't believe how slick it still looks, very well edited, beautifully shot, the use of music is excellent also. It's very well acted, I enjoyed watching Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Love Hewitt most of all. Some really great scares, less comedic then the delivery in Scream, this was more serious, more blunt. Very enjoyable.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
3,lee_eisenberg,"Hook, hook, hook, give us a hook, hook, hook...",6,30 December 2005,"""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is your average stalker movie: teens Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr)accidentally hit a man on a road, and are threatened the next year. Not much of the movie makes sense (and it's silly from time to time), but it's an acceptable flick for what it is. I have to admit, I didn't predict the end - although in retrospect, maybe I should have. I do prefer ""Scream"", but this is nice brainless fun. There's just one thing that I really don't understand: if it happens in North Carolina, why do these kids sound like they live in Beverly Hills?",I Know What You Did Last Summer
4,jboothmillard,I Know What You Did Last Summer,6,7 March 2005,"Based on the book by Lois Duncan, it was originally meant to be some kids and the situation, but Scream writer Kevin Williamson has adapted it into a teen slasher. Basically four friends, Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen Shivers (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry William Cox (Cruel Intentions' Ryan Phillippe) and Ray Bronson (Scooby-Doo's Freddie Prinze Jr.) are driving home after a 4th of July graduation party and beauty pageant. In their slightly drunken state, they accidentally hit a pedestrian walking down the curved corner, and they are convinced that if they go to the police they wouldn't believe the accident claim. So filled with panic they decide to take the apparently dead body to the nearest port and dump it into the sea, and they obviously make a pact to never tell anybody about it. One year passes, each of the four friends have gone their separate ways and still think about that night, and Julie returns home to receive a note saying ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". Fearing the worst, she gets Helen, Barry and Ray back together to find out if this is indeed something to do with hitting that guy on the road. Soon enough a killer wearing a black fisherman's suit and wielding a large hook is hunting them down, they are sure that it is the man they hit, named David Eagen, come back to get revenge. In the end, Julie and Ray are the only two survivors left to fight for their lives against the man who reveals himself to be highly involved with the whole thing. Also starring Bridgette Wilson as Elsa Shivers, Volcano's Anne Heche as Melissa 'Missy' Eagan and Johnny Galecki as Max Neurick. To be honest, I only knew of and wanted to see this film because I saw the spoof in Scary Movie before it. It has some good young stars, it is well scripted with an original plot, and it has some good twisty moments, a good old fashioned teen slasher horror thriller. Good!",I Know What You Did Last Summer
5,BA_Harrison,The perfect slasher for those who LOVE Jennifer's Hewitts.,7,3 August 2010,"Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. star as Julie, Helen, Barry and Ray, four high school friends who accidentally run down a man whilst driving home from a drunken 4th July celebration on the beach. Rather than report the accident, the kids decide to dump the dead body in the sea and let the crabs dispose of any evidence; but as they let the man slide under the water, they realise too late that he isn't actually dead. What was originally just an accident has now become a murder.One year later, and the four friends have gone their separate ways; but after Julie, home from college for the summer, receives an anonymous note that reads 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', and soon after, Barry is attacked by a maniac in a fisherman's slicker, the old school-pals are forced back together to try and figure out who it is that knows about their dirty little secret.His foot still firmly in Hollywood's door after the success of Scream, screenwriter Kevin Williamson played it relatively safe with his next slasher script, I Know What You Did Last Summer. This one offered little of the knowingly-clever, self-referential and post-modernist dialogue that made Wes Craven's hit such a breath of fresh air; instead, it was to be pure popcorn fodder all the way. Slickly directed, light on logic and splatter, heavy on red herrings and mechanical scares, and starring an easy-on-the-eye cast, this movie was designed to be pure, mindless, mainstream fun. Which it is—albeit teen-centric, gore-free, pure, mindless, mainstream fun.Director Jim Gillespie does a commendable job, giving the whole affair a polished look that helps one turn a blind eye to the more ridiculous moments (such as when the killer removes a dead body and a few dozen live crabs from the truck of a car in broad daylight, unseen and all in a matter of minutes); the film also boasts one or two genuinely tense scenes (the best bit being the impossibly cute Sarah Michelle Gellar pursued by the relentless killer), solid performances from the rest of the cast, and a pretty decent, MTV-friendly, heavy rock soundtrack.Call me an old perve if you like, though, but what makes this slasher particularly worthy of attention is Jennifer Love Hewitt's magnificent rack: it doesn't get a complete airing (as always, they stay under wraps), but the girl really know how to rock a tight vest and does just that in the film's entertaining finalé.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
6,moonspinner55,Has some fun with the genre...for about 45 minutes,3,9 November 2006,"For the first three-quarters of an hour, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" builds some credible suspense and you hope the filmmakers will be able to sustain it. They don't. Four rowdy teens plow over a man on a winding road and decide to ditch the body, but a year later a witness seems ready to expose them. Half-comedic slasher flick is well-produced but not especially well written. The derivative ship-board finale (which features bodies suddenly popping up) is pretty awful, and seems more a rip-off than an homage (of somewhat better films like ""Halloween""). The girls do manage some decent acting work, the guys are far less interesting. Followed by one of the worst sequels ever made. ** from ****",I Know What You Did Last Summer
7,edwagreen,I Know What You Did Last Summer-You Shouldn't Know **,4,22 January 2012,This was absolute Gothic horror where 4 graduating high school teens waste a year in believing that they had killed a man who had crossed the road where they were driving.Turns out that someone else killed him for accidentally killing their daughter. The real killer is after the 4 now and the film descends into complete madness. The killer walks around with a hook trying to kill his victims. The bodies pile up including the sheriff of the town and the sister of one of the girls who was riding in the car. Does the hook killer actually think that he is Captain Hook from Peter Pan fame?,I Know What You Did Last Summer
8,BandSAboutMovies,The start of the series,5,30 August 2020,"Lois Duncan's I Know What You Did Last Summer was first published in October 1973. Duncan wrote several books that featured young girls in trouble, including Summer of Fear, which was made into a TV movie directed by Wes Craven.She got the idea for the book when her daughter Kerry told her that she and her best friend had unknowingly been courted by the same boy. She wondered if the boy had deliberately done this, creating a different personality for both of them, and worked his way into their lives to drive a wedge between them. She later read a story about a hit-and-run and put together the story that became the novel (and the loose inspiration for this film).Sadly, Duncan's life became tragic after the unsolved murder of her youngest daughter Kaitlyn. Her last horror novel would be Gallows Hill - which filmed for TV as 1998's I've Been Waiting for You - after which she'd concentrate on non-fiction works about her daughter's case, psychic phenomena and books for kids, like Hotel for Dogs (which was also a movie). Before her death in 2016, ten of her best-loved books would be reissued and modernized with new covers and bits added about modern technology.She would tell Absolute Write that very same year that she was upset with this take on her book: ""I was appalled when my book, I Know What You Did Last Summer, was made into a slasher film. As the mother of a murdered child, I don't find violent death something to squeal and giggle about.""Screenwriter Kevin Williamson had already had success with Scream, which made him the go-to writer for teen horror. He took the source novel, added some inspiration from growing up the son of a fisherman and added the urban legend - stay tuned for these movies - of The Hook to create a new trope of kids who try to wish away the past. for what it's worth, the poster originally said ""from the creator of Scream"" until Miramax sued Columbia Pictures.Unlike the aforementioned Scream, this movie is very much an old-fashioned slasher, despite its initial lack of blood. A throat slashing and the crab factory death were added after the initial cut was viewed to add more danger, as was the character in danger all over again post-script, which would become a thematic inclusion for all entries in this series.For those that argue these things and wonder, ""Is it a giallo?"" I opine that it is more on the side of slasher. Yes, there are gorgeous people in it, but there's a marked lack of fashion, music and, to be honest, the strangeness that that genre is imbued with. That said, the hook-carrying bad guy very much does feel like he belongs there.The story takes place in Southport, North Carolina. Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) are on their way to the beach late at night on one of their last summers together before college pulls them apart when an event unites them all. They hit a pedestrian and instead of allowing their lives to be ruined, they dump the body in the ocean.By the way, the mountain road that they are driving along is the exact same highway from Hitchcock's The Birds.The issue is that their lives are all changed by that one evening with only Julie able to escape the town and go to college. When she returns, the notes that say, ""I know what you did last summer,"" and the gaslighting campaign begins.Jennifer Love Hewitt became a big deal from this film, beyond her fame from Party fo Five, even singing the song ""How Do I Deal"" on the soundtrack. She'd appeared with Jamie Lee Curtis in House Arrest earlier that year and when Curtis was filming nearby, she came over to wish her luck on her first role as a scream queen and would be a consistent visitor to the set.Director Jim Gillespie would move on to make Eye See You/D-Tox, a Stallone film of which we have much to say. Just check out this link.While actually written before Scream, when studios wanted nothing to do with slashers, the success of that film allowed for this one, while making it seem like a rip-off. Such is Hollywood.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
9,Coventry,"Smells fishy, fishy, fisherman!",4,2 April 2021,"This was the first time I re-watched ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" since it came out in theaters; - early 1998. That's more than 22 years ago already! My God, I'm getting old... Anyway, I wasn't very impressed back then, and I'm still not impressed today. If it hadn't been for the previous year's mega-success ""Scream"", also scripted by Kevin Williamson, and the subsequent reincarnation of teen-slasher popularity, IKWYDLS would have gone entirely unnoticed. I'm quite sure of that.Most importantly, the film totally fails to revive and/or refresh the old recipe. The slashers made in the 80s were a lot more brutal, sleazier, bloodier, and a lot less politically correct. The potential is definitely there, though. Set in a traditional North-Carolina fishing town, four perfect teenagers end a night of joyous and drunk celebrations with a deadly hit-and-run accident. Of all the wrong decisions there are to take, they still manage to make the dumbest and most irresponsible. One terrible year later, they find themselves stalked and threatened by someone who...well, know what they did last summer, duh!The only truly essential aspect of slasher cinema sorely lacks! The murders are too scarce, and they are not nearly gruesome enough! This shouldn't be the case, since they are committed with a giant hook, and by a guy in a sinister fishing raincoat! Instead, IKWYDLS features an endless amount of lousy ""boo!"" and ""behind you!"" moments, and focuses far too much on the pretty faces of the four lead stars. And, since I'm close to 40-years-old now, the sight of Jennifer Love Hewitt in a tight tank top isn't all that exciting anymore now as it was in 1998.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
10,michaelRokeefe,Are you sure you did what you think you did?,6,29 June 2001,"Very good horror flick. Sometimes a little obvious, but yet still fun to watch. The gore comes in quick bursts. The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat and then hooked. Four friends are stalked by an unknown killer after accidentally hitting a man with a car and dumping his body.
The foursome is made up of Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Ryan Phillippe. As far as acting ability goes  Hewitt and Prinze showed their potential for bigger things. Anne Heche plays one of her most strangest roles and does so with conviction. Muse Watson plays the fisherman swinging a mean hook.  This scary enough to keep you happy, slasher fiends.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
11,sunwarrior13,A Big Horror Flick In The 90's,9,8 October 2012,"I Know What You Did Last Summer is a horror mystery slasher film based loosely off the book by Lois Duncan of the same name. The film stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr., and features Anne Heche and Bridgette Wilson in supporting roles. The screenplay was written by Kevin Williamson and directed by Jim Gillespie.During the annual July 4th festivities in a North Carolina fishing town, Helen wins a local beauty contest and departs with her boyfriend Barry and pals Julie and Ray. On their way back home, Ray hits a fisherman with her car. The teens panic, drop the body in the water, and abandon the scene. Many months later when Julie returns from college, she gets an anonymous note,""I know what you did last summer."" The four teens suspect the note was written by their classmate Max, but then Max is murdered and the terror begins.Teasing and taut, I Know What You Did Last Summer is a teen horror flick with a different kind of kick to it.It is a smart, sharply drawn horror genre film with a moral center and a solid cast which provides a fun, energetic and scary movie.No wonder it was a big hit during the 90's.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
12,hitchcockthelegend,Ben the Bream.,6,20 October 2015,"Kevin Williamson, hot off of the success of his screenplay for Wes Craven's Scream, here adapted the Lois Duncan novel with mixed results.A bunch of pretty teenagers in a coastal fishing town run over a man in the road and try to cover it up. Not a wise move at the best of times, even more so now as the victim, a hook wielding fisherman, is coming to get them.And that's pretty much it. Williamson adds some humour into the play, while director Jim Gillespie plays his shock tactics well and keeps the pretty young cast annoying enough for us to want to see the fisherman guy enact revenge.It sadly gets away from itself in the last quarter once the stalker is revealed, and in truth there's very little imagination gone into the whole pic. But it's a decent night in with beer and popcorn for those after a short sharp shock type horror. 6/10",I Know What You Did Last Summer
13,Theo Robertson,Who Is The Real Villain ?,4,3 November 2003,"I remember when IKWYDLS was released in 1997 it topped the US box office for a couple of weeks and in horror movie terms it got pretty good reviews , but I fail to see why it was so popular . After all it`s just another film featuring teens getting stalked and slashed by a mysterous killer even if it was written by SCREAM  screenwriter Kevin Williamson . There is a major problem with the screenplay to this movie and that is we are asked to empathise with a group of teenagers who get drunk , drive a car , kill a padestrian and then cover up the crime . If someone wants to bump off drink drivers who kill people they`ve got my support and I found myself siding with the bad guy in this movie because it`s the victims who are the real villains in my opinion  Thankfully Williamson has written a script devoid of post modernist humour but director Jim Gillespie has a laugh at the expense of the audience . As a child of the 1970s I used to watch TISWAS on Saturday mornings and the villain of that anarchistic show was the phantom flan flinger , a sinister faceless figure dressed completely in black and wearing a black hat who`d attack guests and presenters with custard pies , and it`s impossible not to notice the killer in this movie is dressed exactly - And I do mean exactly - like the phantom flan flinger from TISWAS . Considering Gillespie is Scottish and was a child in the 1970s this is no coincidence",I Know What You Did Last Summer
14,preppy-3,Very ordinary and stupid,2,21 May 2008,"Four high school friends are out partying one night after their high school graduation. They are Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.). While driving home they accidentally hit a man on a dark road. Instead of doing the right thing (going to the police), they dump the body in a lake and swear never to tell anyone. This basically destroys their relationship and they part. A year later they all start to get notes stating ""I know what you did last summer"" and find someone is stalking them.An inexplicable box office hit. This was made in the wake of ""Scream""--another big hit. The thing is that ""Scream"" was scary, clever and poked fun at dumb slasher movies. This movie is exactly the kind of movie that ""Scream"" made fun of. The basic plot idea is stupid but OK and they have some good actors in it, but it gets dumber by the minute. There are red herrings galore and huge gaps in logic.PLOT SPOILERS!!! Barry is killed in a pretty bloody way but, minutes later, there's not a bit of blood anywhere. Julie find a dead wet body in the trunk of her car and, minutes later, it's completely gone and the trunk is totally dry. The killer manages to turn off the lights in a store--but he's nowhere near the light switch. Helen is running from the killer but, just a few steps away from safety, she stops (for no reason) and just stands there so the killer can get her. I could go on and on--those are just a few examples of the stupidity in this script. PLOT SPOILER END!!!! I'm a big horror fan and I realize logic goes out the window in most slasher films BUT this one goes too far. It just gets more insulting as it goes on with stupid actions and impossible incidents left and right. I got the distinct feeling that the makers of this were treating the audience with utter contempt and got more and more annoyed as the movie progressed. The only thing that kept me watching were the four leads. These aren't their best performances--Prinze appears drugged and Phillippe's constant yelling got tiresome--but I like all the actors and they kept my attention. But, all in all, this was a stupid insulting horror film devoid of scares--or logic. This only gets 2 because it's better than its even worse sequel.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

OK psycho/slasher/thriller/horror/mystery.",5,13 March 2005,"It's the 4th July and I Know What You Did Last Summer opens to an aerial shot of the sea. The camera glides over the surface, pans up and reveals the coastline of the small American fishing town of Southport and Dawson's Beach. It circles around a bit and starts to zoom in on a fisherman named David Egan (Jonathan Quint) sitting on the edge of a cliff, the viewer is left with the impression that he wants to commit suicide. Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has just been crowned the town's queen after winning a beauty pageant of some sort. Helen and her boyfriend Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe), along with two of their friends Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and her boyfriend Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) decide to head over to Dawson's Beach for a special night before summer ends and they all split up & go their different ways. While there Barry gets drunk and so Ray says that he will drive them all back home, Barry says that no one drives his car but him. He gets outvoted and Ray begins the drive back home. While messing around Barry distracts Ray and they run into a man, apparently killing him. Everyone agrees that the police would think that Barry was driving because it is his car and because he is drunk and they would all be in a lot of trouble and possibly ruin their careers, they decide to dump the body in the sea and not say anything about the incident to anyone. The body's face is badly cut up and unrecognisable. Just then one of Julie's friends Max Neurick (Johnny Galecki) drives up. They manage to get rid of him without him suspecting anything. They are all now committed to going through with the plan. As they prepare to dump the body in the sea it jerks and grabs Helen, Barry and Ray beat him and throw him in the sea. They all now know it was murder, not an accident. 'One Year Later'. Julie has been away at university and is preparing to go home to Southport for the summer. Once back home her mom (Deborah Hobart) gives her a letter that was delivered earlier in the day. Julie opens it and inside a note says 'I Know What You Did Last Summer!'. Julie finds Helen, who now works for her sister Elsa (Bridgette Wilson) in their Father's shop, and together they go and see Barry, who doesn't seem to do a lot at all. They all assume that Max must be responsible and go to see him. Soon after Max is killed. Julie, Helen & Barry then run into Ray at the docks who now works as a fisherman. As the days pass Helen, Julie, Barry and Ray are all terrorised in different ways as the 4th July approaches. The first anniversary of what happened last summer! Will they be able to discover the identity of the killer with a grudge? Will any of them live long enough to see the summer out? And who exactly did they kill that night? Watch it and find out!Directed by Jim Gillespie I thought I know What You Did Last Summer was a pretty decent teen slasher. I had seen it back in '97 during it's original theatrical run and didn't think much of it at all. I watched it again last night for the first time since and probably because I had much lower expectations liked it a lot more. The script by Kevin Williamson based on the novel by Lois Duncan has a good central premise. It sets things up nicely but after they all meet back up for the first time it loses it's way somewhat and drags. There are only three on screen kills, and just four in total, which just isn't enough to maintain most people's interest, well not mine anyway. A couple more murders and this would have been a much better film. The killers identity is kept secret until the end, but it's not really a who dun-nit as when they are revealed at the end is the first time they've appeared in the film. The corny & predictable ending scene has sequel written all over it and a sequel was indeed made in the form of I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998). Director Gillespie manages to craft a few pretty decent sequences, I especially liked the killer chasing Sarah Michelle Gellar through the shop and along the deserted nighttime streets of Southport, as well as the climax when the killer stalks Jennifer Love Hewitt in, around and through the bowls of a fishing trawler with it's fishing hooks, nets and chugging engine machinery. There are no special effects or gore to speak of, just a hook thrust into someones chin & a shot of a severed hand, all of the other murders are almost totally bloodless which is not a good thing. As one would expect from a big budget, well $17,000,000 is pretty big to me, Hollywood film I know What You Did Last Summer has a nice technical polish throughout and is well made. Having said that I thought the cinematography by Denis Crossan was noticeably flat and unexciting, don't expect any weird camera angles or elaborate shots here. The relatively young cast does a pretty good job and put in decent performances. A special mention goes to Sarah Michelle Gellar who is a mighty fine looking young lady, if you know what I mean. Generally speaking I Know What You Did Last Summer is a passable time waster, nothing more. Don't expect too much and you might get some sort of enjoyment out of it. Worth watching if you can find it cheap or watch it on T.V. for free which is probably quite easy.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

In fact this may be the only one I have seen, and it is a fitting tribute of the genre for our birthday girl, Sarah Michelle Geller.Writer Kevin Williamson follows up Scream with a serious example of just how effective these movies can be if they're well-written, directed and acted.Sarah Michelle Geller (Buffy, TMNT) and Jenniver Love Hewitt (Ghost Whisperer) fit perfectly together and are supported by Ryan Phillippe (Crash, Breach, Flags of Our Fathers) and Freddie Prinze Jr. Why does that sentence sound naughty?

17,zardoz-13,It Will Hook You!,8,2 May 2009,"A quartet of teenagers in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" go for a joyride after dark on July fourth, accidentally hit a pedestrian, and then try to cover up their crime. This refreshingly well-written but grisly thriller about a sadistic slayer, the hapless teen victims, and a bloody fishhook has more going for it than you might expect. The success of ""Scream"" has whetted the appetites of both movie makers and audiences for more entries in the teen slasher genre. Happily, ""I Know"" provides all the usual thrills and chills of ""Scream,"" but bristles with better plot twists, more calculating characters, a dynamic villain, and a slam-bang finale in the tradition of Brian De Palma's ""Carrie."" Unhappily, first-time feature film director Jim Gillespie suppresses the more literate points in Kevin Williamson's inventive, psychological script to promote the more commercial elements of guts, gore, and gruesomeness.Set in a cozy North Carolina fishing hamlet, ""I Know"" chronicles the exploits of Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen Shivers Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry William Cox (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) on a final summer fling before they either leave for college or get real jobs. Leggy, good-looking Helen wins a local beauty pageant, and the teens party hardy on a lonely stretch of beach with the surf crashing in the background. When they aren't concocting campfire tales about a vicious killer, they're making out in the dunes. Binge-drinking Barry gets too sloshed to drive his shiny new BMW so Ray—a non-boozer—takes the wheel. On the way home, Barry's berserk drinking antics distract Ray. Suddenly, before Ray can swerve, a man steps in front of them. Smashing into the guy, the car careens to a halt, and the teens find his bloody body in a ditch. Too freaked out to verify his death or alert the authorities, our protagonists argue briefly before they dump the body in the briny deep. They hope for the best, but their efforts only yield the worst.Julie, Helen, Barry, and Ray make a pact: they will carry their secret to the grave. Little do they realize how deadly such vows turn out for them. Gradually, these best friends drift apart. A year after the incident, Julie suffers the most trauma from the collision. Reluctantly, she comes home for the summer and receives the shock of her life. An anonymous letter addressed to her contains the simple but devastating message: ""I know what you did last summer."" Guilt grips her like an icy cold fist. Julie wants to call the police despite the consequences. Instead, she allows herself to be argued down, and she fears now that her life may be the price for her silence. Scary things start to happen. Helen, who treasured her long blond hair, awakens one morning to find her golden tresses shorn and a threat scrawled in lipstick on her bedroom mirror. The cocksure Barry loses his football letter jacket, and the killer runs Barry's automobile down into the jock's own house. Finally, Julie discovers a body packed in the trunk of her car. Barry suspects that Ray is the villain.Meanwhile, the clear-minded Julie tries to identify the guy they hit. Helen and Julie take a trip into the sticks. They visit Melissa Egan (Anne Heche of ""Donny Brasco"") who lives alone and spends most of her day carving up dead farm animals. According to newspaper reports, the body of Melissa's brother washed up not long after the hit and run, but the police attribute the boy's death to drowning. Our heroines want to find out if Melissa's brother might have had a vigilante for a friend. Once again the incriminating finger points at Ray. If ""I Know"" appears to imitate ""Scream,"" scenarist Kevin Williamson receives both the blame and the credit. After all, he wrote both movies. He has as much fun here bashing those eerie old campfire tales as he had busting slasher movies in ""Scream."" The film opens with a legitimate, real-life predicament before it degenerates into an adrenalin gouge-and-gut thriller. These teens worry more about contacting the authorities than they do about disposing of a body. Not only has Williamson penned a tense, entertaining script, he has also pressed a few politically correct buttons. The movie suggests that only the worst things can happen when teens drink and drive. The peer pressure that teenagers endure is rampant, and they must take responsibility for their actions. Director Gillespie pushes most of these worthwhile didactic themes into the shadows.The ""I Know"" villain dresses in high sinister fashion as a fisherman. Attired in an oilskin slicker, rubber boots and a southwester, the villain looks like a duster-clad cowboy from a spaghetti western crossed with ""Star War"" villain Darth Vader. The chilling quality of the masquerade is that we never see whose face lurks behind the disguise, and we never hear his voice. The huge diabolical fishhook that our fiend brandishes makes lugging corpses around on its curved, wicked point makes it look easy. Williamson has created an original killer with a theatrical sense of style. Many slasher movie villains have their own musical theme that announces their presence. The ""I Know"" villain fiddles with one of his villain's trinkets. The distinctive sound that it produces not only serves as the killer's leitmotif, but also apprises us of the fiend's presence.If you enjoy good scary movies, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" holds its own with the classic slashers, so you shouldn't be disappointed. Enough surprises occur in the story to keep you guessing when you aren't feeling paranoid. The dastardly fisherman is destined to take a place in the pantheon of movie murderers. Homicide has acquired a fresh look! In the tradition of ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Halloween,"" and the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, ""I Know What You Did Last summer"" unleashes a shocker ending that paves the way for an inevitable sequel.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Like Diet Scream, or a step or two further down",6,15 April 2008,"Don't get the wrong idea from my summary... this is entirely watchable, it's just somewhat bland(and comparing this to aforementioned earlier Williamson piece is pure death to the former, pun intended). The concept is based on an urban legend(mentioned herein, though lacking the clever referencing and hinting at self-awareness that, again, the other script Kevin brought us featured). I have not read the book, nor any other by the author(though I've also watched I've Been Waiting For You). The plot isn't bad, and there is a fine enough amount of random creepiness in the movie. The acting varies, not even all the ""name"" ones deliver particularly mesmerizing performances. The dialog is mostly standard(or below it), but it does have moments, even if they are few and far between. It usually tries too hard, and winds up not sounding ""young"", hip, clever, or anything it goes for. The music is not anywhere near as good as that of Scream(the first one, and to a lesser extent, the trilogy as a whole). This has what you'd expect in(at least one of the newer) slasher flicks, and it's passable(if not always terribly creative). The scares aren't *all* jump scares. It can be exciting at points, and if you are sufficiently generous, it may get you going. Cinematography and editing are nothing special. I recommend this to fans of the kind of film it is, just know that there are more accomplished ones out there, and more or less everyone involved have done better work elsewhere. 6/10",I Know What You Did Last Summer
19,view_and_review,"Young people getting slaughtered, how original",4,28 October 2020,"This movie got quite a bit of pub back in '97, so much so I thought it was the next ""Scream."" ""Scream"" it was not. It was the same formulaic scary movie whenever the identity of the slasher killer is unknown: bodies pop up, concerned parties begin to investigate, they uncover the mystery, more people die, they kill the killer, damsel in distress lives.Four teens hit a man on the highway (yes, it was only one driver, but I'm saying all four in the car hit him anyway). Instead of calling the police and whatnot they decided to dump the body in a lake/inlet to protect themselves from possible prosecution. Of the four kids two were male and two were female. The two guys were Ray (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and Barry (Ryan Phillipe). Ray was a relatively level headed guy from a working class family. Barry was roid raged hot-head from money. The two gals were Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Julie was the smart good girl and Helen was the blond beauty queen.Now you know who died and who lived.Scary movies hardly ever make sense and IKWYDLS is as guilty as ever of stupidity. A year after they dumped the live body they reconvened in the small town of Southport, N.C. where the harassment by the killer began. It was clear he didn't want to kill them right away, rather he wanted to terrorize them first.
OK, I can dig it, but he started by killing a guy named Max (Johnny Galecki)---a guy who had nothing to do with the four teens that dumped him in the lake. Why kill that guy? Even now I'm unclear how that fit into his plan of revenge.4th of July is when this killer wanted to take them all out. He started with Barry (most obvious choice). He was able to kill him on the balcony of a theater and move the body within minutes before a cop got up there to check things out. It was almost as neat of a trick as him stuffing Max's body and about 100 crabs into Julie's trunk and then removing all of it in the five minutes it took for her to go get her friends. Honestly, at that point my mind was made up that this had better be a movie about a supernatural killer if he can just effortlessly whisk bodies away.The rain slicker killer killed Helen next, though at times it seemed he wasn't trying to. He was pursuing her so slowly it was like he wanted her to get away. And before you try to compare him to Michael Myers just stop. It was nothing more than a bad plot device to make Helen's death more dramatic and prolonged.That only left Ray and Julie. I knew Julie would live, but the question was whether or not Ray would live. They both did, but not before the entire lame backstory of our murderer was revealed as though we were supposed to be blown away that the guy they threw in the lake never died and was their killer.IKWYDLS is another pathetic scary movie with dumb pretty youngsters and a psychotic white male. There was nothing that set this movie apart from other crappy scary movies except the names of the actors and actresses.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
20,morrison-dylan-fan,It feels like Summer.,6,24 November 2017,"Gathering up flicks to view for ICM's poll of the best films from 1997,I read a Facebook post from HMV marking 20 years since this title came out.Shoerly after seeing that post,I found it being added to Netflix UK,and spotted fellow IMDber Red-Barracuda rate it. With all these coincidences, it felt like the perfect time to go on a Summer holiday.The plot:Celebrating Helen Shivers being crowned college princess,pals Shivers,her boyfriend Barry Cox, Julie James and her boyfriend Ray Bronson drive home drunk. Paying no attention to the road,the gang run over a man dressed in a long black coat. Believing they would be charged with manslaughter,the group pick up the body and chuck it into the ocean. Just as the body is being thrown, the man screams and puts his hand out. Losing contact with her friends after they all vowed a year ago not to tell anyone of what they did,James is horrified to get an anonymous letter,saying that they know what she did last Summer.View on the film:Only keeping a partial reference to the original ending,and the drunk teens run over a person part of Lois Duncan's book, (whose daughter Kaitlyn was killed in an unsolved murder,and who hated this adaptation,with the book being about the remorse the teens (none of whom are killed) have over taking the life of an innocent man) the screenplay by Kevin Williamson hooks into his most streamline take on the Slasher genre,with Williamson's pop culture- driven dialogue being clipped to a handful of stray lines of dialogue,and the set-pieces lacking any serious feeling of danger. Locking the door on a person being trapped in a car whilst a nutter waits outside, (a major theme of his work) Williamson gathers a surprisingly nasty group for the slayings,with their blunt exchanges stubbing out any chance of empathy growing for any member of the gang.Despite being filmed in California, director Jim Gillespie (despite this being a big hit,he would not direct again until 2002's The Legacy) & cinematographer Denis Crossan give the movie a very good small,fishing town vibe,as slick tracking shots catch the daily prep of seafood in the background,as the teens get slayed. Appearing to be inspired by the Giallo sub-genre, Gillespie gives the black coat- wearing psycho ultra-stylised Slasher set-pieces,from the killer hiding in smoke-covered rooms,to the face of the murderer being revealed via a reflection in the glasses of a victim,as Julie James is reminded what she did last Summer.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

Here is a horror film about a watchful presence out to advocate that term. It regards four high school graduates who are out racing and drinking until they hit someone. They dump the body to avoid a manslaughter charge then make a pact for secrecy. A year later they all receive notes that say, ""I know what you did last summer."" Jennifer Love Hewitt discovers a body in the trunk of her car. Sarah Michelle Gellar wakes up with her locks sheared. Ryan Phillippe is nearly hit by a car. This leaves Freddie Prinze Jr. to take the blame. Anne Heche makes an appearance as a nut case. This is generally an effective horror film with an interesting theme but unfortunately the killer is someone who had no previous screen time. The third act boils down to the standard chase and slash with that ever familiar cheat ending that opens a sequel but director Jim Gillespie presents an eerie atmosphere that works in its favor. We can understand the dilemma the characters face even if our circumstances are greatly different. We have all tried to hide something at some point. The past can haunt us like a hangover on the dawn of a heavy drinking night. Score: 8 / 10",I Know What You Did Last Summer
22,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Incredibly underwhelming mainstream slasher,4,13 October 2018,"A year after a terrible accident, a group of friends involved with the accidental death of a strange man in their small town finds themselves stalked by a deranged madman supposedly seeking revenge on the group for the incident and must find out their identity to escape the situation alive.This here was one of the most troubling and frustrating slashers ever. Most of what works here is almost solely limited to the fateful accident that starts the whole affair going here, as the pure panic and utter confusion that occurs here as they begin accurately and logically fighting amongst each other in rather compelling fashion. The way they go on through the different scenarios for them and their future together here after the accident, it makes for a wholly realistic scenario here which plays off into the body-dumping scene at the waterfront which culminates in a rather enjoyable scene. Likewise, some of the stalking scenes here make for an enjoyable time with the exploits of the killer doing a brilliant job of making the group think they are going crazy instead of killing them including the crabs in the car trunk, the later realization that he had snuck into the house to rearrange a person's hairstyle and the appearance at the festival all work rather nicely here. As well, the actual kill stalkings offer a bit more creepiness as the appearance at the department store, the ambush at the restaurant and the chase with the car down the highway bring out some genuinely creepy scenes aided along by bringing the killer front-and-center with his great costume. These here are all that really work here as there are a few major problems with it. The main problem with this one is that there is such a small amount of potential victims around that by having a large number survive is a detriment to the amount of deaths you can have. By merely having characters around for the sake of making them a victim is nice, but it merely makes the killer seem like he can't take out the main victims. Since the first hour of the film is simply stalking scenes, the mayhem doesn't start until the final half-hour, and even then, there is an extremely low body count. If he can't give the impression of taking out everybody in the cast, that makes it feel like the killer isn't someone to be feared when they can't put everyone in danger of being killed at any time and he ends up getting by on the strength of the costume. Also, the film's central group of characters aren't in the slightest bit interesting or realistic which severely undermines this one. There's very little about their relationships with each other that strikes this as being realistic with the sarcastic, snippy and completely unsupportive manner that they are absolutely unconvincing as a group of friends caught up in the struggle with the killer and manages to really make it hard to care about their plight when it seems none of the group really cares about each other. That's not helped at all by the utterly moronic storyline here where the central plotlines of the film have absolutely nothing original to offer here beyond the central setup of their body count-unleashing killer's purpose, but to get to that the film offers up continuous streams of cliche-riddled sequences that offer up countless moments of stupidity than anything. Various attacks throughout the film never make sense, continuous set-ups are offered simply for plot convenience and the entire affairs reeks of general incompetence in that case. Even the supposedly fun action at the ending is underwhelming, filmed with lame stalking, a boring series of beatdowns that serve only to keep prolonging the action instead of having the killer actually kill the people interrupting him from carrying out his plans and the whole resolution is carried out only to serve setting up a sequel. It's enough to really lower this one significantly.Rated R: Extreme Language Graphic, Graphic Violence, and scenes of drinking.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
23,FlashCallahan,I Know What Movie Your Cashing In On......,6,19 March 2015,"When four friends accidentally hit and kill a man on a road at night, they panic and decide to dump the body into the sea. A year later, they all try to settle down again, but one of the friends receives a note in the post, with the words that would make a really good title for a horror movie riding on the success of Scream.. As each of the friends get their own reminder, and they finally accept the one thing they feared the most; someone knows what happened that night, and now they're out for revenge.......The premise is wonderful, a typical throwback to the slasher movies of the eighties, featuring a killer with decidedly just cause, but after nearly twenty years, it just doesn't hold up.Because of the advent of Scream, and the birth of ironic, wink wink cinema, IKWYDLS seems rather lost now in the vast world of the slasher picture, because it doesn't seem to know how to have fun with the high concept, to be a little tongue in cheek.Hewitt aside, the four central characters/actors are uninteresting capsules, almost programmed to function in the classic horror mould. Phillippe plays the most unconvincing Jock I've ever seen, Gellar, again unconvincing as a beauty scream queen, she just isn't scathing enough, and Prinze Jr., he's just channelling Keanu in Point Break.Whilst there is mysticism to the killer, once Julie meets him face to face, it's literally sixty seconds before she realises its him, thus giving the audience zero tension between the two, just straight to the chase around the boat.Anne Heche pops up in a very bizarre cameo to fill in a few plot points, and by the time it's all over, your thinking to yourself 'I'm glad she's looking better, but shouldn't have that been a little more fun?'.Funnily enough, the proper sequel is beyond bonkers, throws all logic out of the window, and it's all the better for it.Not bad by any means, just 15 years too late.....",I Know What You Did Last Summer
24,Wuchakk,The guilt will haunt you and maybe even KILL you,6,8 November 2015,"Released in 1997, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" takes place in coastal North Carolina where a group of just-graduated teens experience a tragic event and compound it by foolishly reacting. They swear to carry the secret to their graves, but the next summer it becomes clear that someone knows their secret and murders start piling up. The teens are played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. Also on hand are Johnny Galecki, Anne Heche and Muse Watson.This movie is full of slasher clichés, like the killer who's always in the same garb (this time a fisherman's slicker outfit), the slow-methodical walking of the killer (never running) and the undead dead. There are also two blatant ""Yeah, right"" scenes (noted below). Thankfully, it makes up for it by the stellar coastal locations (strangely shot on BOTH East and West coasts), a quality cast, some effective sequences and the potent moral on haunting guilt that slowly kills ya. The immediate aftermath of the opening accident is particularly well done.The film runs 99 minutes and shot in Southport, North Carolina, and Jenner, California, and nearby regions of both coasts.GRADE: B or B- (6.5/10 Stars) ***SPOILER ALERT*** (DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM) Here are the two eye-rolling scenes: 1. The sequence where Max's corpse is found in the trunk with the crabs. It couldn't have been an illusion since Helen didn't yet know Max was dead, so it must've really happened. If so, how would the slicker-killer get the trunk cleaned-up so quickly with no one seeing him in a neighborhood in broad daylight? Also, how did he even get into trunk? Did he have his own personal key? The sequence is just too far-fetched.2. After Barry is murdered by the killer at the pageant how does he know that the cop and Helen would be driving down the alley by-pass an hour or so later? (I realize the street was blocked off and he might've been the one who set it up, but how did he know this would be the precise route taken by the cop and Helen? And how would he even know Helen would be riding with the cop? It's not like she wouldn't have other friends & family in town with whom she could ride. Anyway, wouldn't people living in the downtown area or other passersby notice a man in full-slicker garb working on his truck? Sequences like these take mature viewers right out of the story, which explains Roger Ebert's response: ""After the screening was over and the lights went up, I observed a couple of my colleagues in deep and earnest conversation, trying to resolve twists in the plot. They were applying more thought to the movie than the makers did.""",I Know What You Did Last Summer
25,trashgang,the second flick that started a new horror era,6,9 September 2016,"I still remember this flick because a colleague back them his music was used in this flick with 2 Wicky by Hooverphonic. But not only that. I'm a big horror geek and I can tell you that after the slasher era horror was death and was even not done for a while. Nobody was interested anymore in the genre and after 1987 it was all bad and laughable what came out of the genre. But 1996 did put horror back on the number one list with Scream. The only problem was the fact that it all was made for the teens walking around. Scream did offer some gory moments but this flick here clocking in on the success of the new breed of horror is low on that part. No more nudity and extreme gore or point of view shots or first person shots. Still, it was a big success due the thespians in it. Girls were screaming due the six pack shown by Ryan Phillippe and guys were in love with Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar.The story itself was rather strong because it was not a whodunit but more a who we just killed script. All characters did fit together and let that be why this flick do works. Of course the older horror buffs did hate the new breed of horror. Now that I watched it again almost 20 years later I can understand the discussion being made then. It's indeed low on horror but it did make people scream for so many reasons. And I must also say that it isn't outdated for a 20 year old flick. It's not that perfect but still watchable. Together with Scream it created and started the teen horror that also died of course but the trend was set, horror was back a must done in Hollywood and look nowadays, it still is a must to make them.

The book was more of a moral story while this was just a plain slasher teen flick, but over all I would say that I Know What You Did Last Summer was a decent horror flick. It starred the biggest stars of it's time: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Jennifer Love Hewitt, and Ryan Phillipe, and surprisingly they clicked pretty well, but I think that's because they just all have to play pretty white kids with problems, lol. But it's all good, this was a fun little horror flick.Four high school friends have graduated and are celebrating the fourth of July. They all have big plans: Julie is planning to go to Harvard, Helen is going to New York to become an actress, Ray is staying in town to help with the business of fishing, and Barry has a wrestling scholarship. They all are just having a big party and while driving home they accidentally hit a man, killing him. Freaked out and scarred for what might happen since alcohol is involved, they dump the body in the river hoping that it'll go away. But a year later when the friends re-unite, they are receiving letters claiming that someone knows what they did. Barry is then hit by a car, Helen's hair is chopped off, and Julie gets bodies put into her car trunk; they all must face the fisherman who is after them with a big hook and it seems like he does not want these kids to live.I Know What You Did Last Summer has typical Dawson's Creek drama, but it's all good, I mean it was written by Kevin Williamson who wrote the series. But the cast did click very well and as cliché'd as the movie was, it's still good for a scare. Sarah does have one of the best damsel in distress chase scenes ever, that was pretty intense I have to admit.

29,OllieSuave-007,Exciting slasher flick!,8,15 January 2014,"The 1990s was known for its teenage and young adult horror/slasher movies and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is what I think one of the more memorable and exciting slasher flicks from that decade.Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddy Prinze Jr. and Ryan Phillippe star as four friends who, after a wild night at a Fourth of July outdoor party, accidentally hit a man on a road at night with their car. They dump the body in hopes of covering up the accident and try to get on with their lives afterward. A year later, one by one, they start receiving notes with the words ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" written on it, and soon, a terrible course of events start happening to them.The acting is pretty good, believable and emotional, but not over-the-top, although Freddy Prinze could have used a little more emotion and tension; he seemed a little too monotone and stiff. The plot was fast-paced and exciting, keeping the audience entertained, especially in the parts where horrific pranks and deadly events take place around the four teenagers after they discover that someone learned of their hit-and-run accident the year before. How the accident made a negative impact on their friendships were also brilliantly acted out in the movie, and then when the teens had to put their differences aside to take on the menace is intriguing to watch.Many horror movies get by with excessive gore, blood, killings and campy acting. This one actually has a story, suspense and descent acting. It's a good one to enjoy on a Friday night, on Halloween or a horror marathon.Grade B+",I Know What You Did Last Summer
30,sddavis63,Overall I Found This Silly Rather Than Frightening,4,9 May 2011,"For a movie that led off what what may be the most ominous musical score I've ever heard, in the end it disappoints. There's a slow start which eventually leads up to the main event of the movie - the car accident, which apparently kills a mysterious pedestrian who was crossing the street in the middle of nowhere. A year later, the four teenagers who were in the car (and who thought they'd covered up the accident rather well) begin to get mysterious notes from someone claiming ""I know what you did last summer."" They've become targets of - someone, and the rest of the movie follows that mystery as the kids try to figure out who's trying to kill them and why.To be honest, this movie lost my attention rather quickly. It's supposed to be frightening, but for the most part I didn't find it to be frightening. There's several rather bloody or gory scenes, but few truly frightening moments. In fact, all the way through this seemed to have an unfortunate atmosphere of silliness to it. The young cast was OK, but not great, and the story itself seemed to be trying almost too hard to be mysterious, but in the end it really only served to confuse me. The last fifteen minutes or so on the boat turned out to be not too bad. It was fairly suspenseful in fact, as Julie (played by Jennifer Love Hewitt) desperately tried to escape from the crazed fisherman/murderer who's been responsible for stalking them all this time.Those last fifteen minutes are pretty good, but the movie had so lost me by the time they appeared that I was having trouble at that point putting the pieces together and understanding exactly why this guy wanted the kids dead. So, it's got some good moments in it, but overall I found it to be a pretty weak movie. (4/10)",I Know What You Did Last Summer

32,sol-kay,The Phantom Fisherman,5,14 June 2005,"**SPOILERS** Average slasher film where in this movie the unseen killer, until the last ten minutes,is a raincoat and hooded fisherman. This guy has a grudge against these four young collage students who did or did not run him down on a deserted highway. Then, thinking he's dead, dumped him in the sea to end up being dinner for the local marine life. The four students Julie and Helen, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Geller, together with their boyfriends Ray and Barry, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Ryan Phillippe, doing their best to forget what happened that fourth of July are reminded of their actions exactly a year later. With letters and other reminders of that tragic night telling them ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". The movie has a real convoluted plot with a number of scenes that don't fit in or make any sense at all.Like the body that Julie finds in her car trunk covered with live and crawling crabs. At first Barry suspects that it's Max, Johnny Galecki, a fellow student who's sending these notes trying to scare them. Max came on the scene of the accident that July Fourth evening and may have known that the quintet, Julie Helen Barry and Ray, had something to do with the death of a resident of Southport who was found floating in the Southport N.C Bay. The suspicion of Max being the one sending the threatening letters is soon dispelled with him ending up dead at the end of the deranged fisherman's fish hook. The film ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" keeps going around in circles for about an hour with this fisherman popping up in a number of scenes and then disappearing, just as fast, before he ever does anything. Julie and Helen checking out the local Southport newspapers come up with an Eddie Egan who was found a day later in the waters offshore who fit the description of the person that they dispatched the night before. Going to see Eddie's sister Missy, Anne Heche, they soon realize that it wasn't Eddie that the ran down and killed that night so who could the dead man have been? It later turns out that they guy that was run over that night by their car isn't dead, he's very much alive and dangerous. Even more startling is that there's a connection between the dead Eddie Egan and the live fish hook killer and it has to do with another car accident around the same place in Southport the year before. That involved Eddie Egan and a very close relative of the killer fisherman. Lumbering along it's hard to follow the movie since it doesn't really have that much of a story to it other then some nut on the loose with a fish hook. For some reason the killer didn't scare me at all because he was made to be so phantom-like that I half expected to see his victim get, or later show, up after he killed them. It was as if the entire story was some kind of dream or nightmare by one of the cast members. The ending of the movie with Julie in a steaming shower had that same exact effect on me in that the only sense it made was that it was some kind of dream or hallucination and had no contact with reality at all. The revelation of the killer at the conclusion of the movie was so lame and anti-climatic that by then you didn't really care who he was. His later battle to the death slug fest with the two remaining young people, who he was out to murder, was as predictable as you could imagine it to be. With the film leaving open the suggestion that there's room for a sequel in the very near future which in fact there was.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

34,CuriosityKilledShawn,Quite boring,5,29 July 2000,"This was the first true product off the conveyor belt of Hollywood teen-slasher flicks after the highly over-exposed SCREAM. Teen-slashers were suddenly back in fashion. And Hollywood loves teen-slashers. These movies are basically the same tripe done over and over, made for very little, with no aces up the sleeve andactors in their 20s playing teenagers. Something that bothers me very much. You've probably noticed this by looking at my other reviews. IKWYDLS is no exception. Every scene has been done before and the film has little originality. Some of the killings are totally pointless and are only there to fill up the running time and give us something to look at while the characters argue over 'who is the killer'. A standard argument in these kind of movies.It's a very boring film. It takes ages to get started and when it finally does get going it's more annoying than it is exciting.

36,paulclaassen,Undoubtedly one of the most memorable teen slasher movies.,6,20 May 2021,"It's hard to believe 'I know what you did last summer' was made over two decades ago. This classic teenage slasher is still one of the most memorable movies in the genre.Although a slasher, the film has substance. The very idea of what these teenagers are going through, makes one wonder: what would I have done if I were in that situation? The event leading to the revenge killings can so easily happen to anyone of us. Its believable and quite honestly a daunting thought. What would you have done?What happens after the accident, off course is pure slasher material, but it still has substance. 'I know what you did last summer' is a creepy film with well crafted suspense. Naturally, there are a number of false scares and some credibility issues and coincidences, but in general this was thoroughly enjoyable. The performances were very good and the film itself has style and from the opening moments just felt memorable. The title alone is enough to make you want to watch it out of curiosity.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
37,zkonedog,Only Good For '90s Nostalgia,2,28 February 2017,"Back in the late 1990s, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was a phenomenon. I remember it being advertised up the wazoo, and then catching it on late night cable some time later and liking it. Unfortunately, a recent viewing proved that this film has aged terribly (if it ever could have been considered ""good"" in the first place).The plot of this movie is simple: Four stereotypical teens are partying the Fourth of July before going off to college. The ""good girl"" (Jennifer Love Hewitt), her All-American boyfriend (Freddie Prinze Jr.), the beauty queen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), and the hot-head jock (Ryan Phillipe). While driving home on a windy mountain road, their car hits a figure in a rain-slicker. They make the decision to dump his body in the lake to avoid a police investigation. Fast-forward a year later, and all of a sudden a similarly slickered figure begins hunting the four down one by one.This movie is a mess from beginning to end. It does start with a kernel of a decent idea, but even at best it is three-star buffoonery. The characters are not nearly developed enough to make viewers care about them, and the plot is asinine even by horror film standards. By the end, it is a one-star train wreck.The reason this film gets such ""strong press"" is because it does tap into a sense of 1990s nostalgia. All the main four principles were huge '90s stars, so it was kind of a ""perfect storm"" of popularity. This is the kind of movie that tweens/teens saw to gush over the ""dreamy"" guys and the ""hot"" girls. Plot/character development were an afterthought. This film was meant (from what I have read, and it makes sense) to capitalize on the popularity of ""Scream"".The truly sad part? This flick had some potential. Those main four are all pretty decent actors, but there is just no material to work with here. Again, a film made too hastily to capitalize on box- office success. It did manage to make quite a name for itself, but that luster wears off rather quickly as soon as you pop it in and press ""PLAY"".",I Know What You Did Last Summer
38,filipemanuelneto,"Empty, predictable and even humorous.",4,24 September 2015,"In this film, a group of teenagers commit a crime and decides to keep that secret forever but someone knows what they did and decides to punish them. From the same writer of ""Scream"" (Kevin Williamson), this film is directed by Jim Gillespie and features Jennifer Love Hewitt as a protagonist.Teen movies usually go up in college or the end of high school, and show plots with stereotyped groups of adolescents (sexual perverts, idiots, nerds, dumb blonde's and others). This film starts from that and introduces notes of suspense: a crime, a secret, several murders throughout the plot and a busty girl playing the damsel in distress. This would make an excellent comedy (who doesn't like to see stupid teenagers to die horribly in movies?) and there are several moments that are deeply hilarious and predictable. The creation of suspense fails repeatedly for that reason.Jennifer Love Hewitt is a satisfactory actress, but fails to convince the audience. The problem may not be the actress but the plot, the script and the way her character was planned. The actress tries at various times to reach a higher level of psychological tension but ruins everything with theatrical moments and hysterical screams. The rest of the cast doesn't matter, are there to die or kill. The best of the film is to discover the killer's identity but, unfortunately, if we just want that, any CSI series or similar can give that even better.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

Sarah Michelle Gellar (a little chubby) just stands and looks pretty. The rest of the cast is just okay.The movie has some interesting parts and suspenseful scenes but not enough to make it a solid Horror movie.

44,Anonymous_Maxine,Another in a long line of inexplicably successful teen slasher movies that would fall flat if people would realize what they were watching.,2,9 September 2000,"I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it. I got a lot of good thrills out of it and basically just had a good time. However, when I watched it on video, the larger than life quality was entirely removed and I noticed a lot of things that hadn't occurred to me when I saw it in the theater. The acting, for example, was absolutely awful from everyone involved except for Anne Heche in the few scenes that she was in. And what is the big deal about Jennifer Love Hewitt?! She may be moderately attractive but she is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen, and I've seen some horrible acting (see ""Nightmare Weekend""). Sarah Michelle Gellar is totally unconvincing and Ryan Phillippe delivers the worst performance of his career. And don't even get me started on Freddie Prinze Jr. His eyebrows say it all every time.Besides that, the story, although theoretically possible, was terribly presented. A bunch of teenagers are partying and driving out in the hills late at night, they accidentally hit a man and, thinking he's dead, dump his body into a river to avoid having their lives needlessly ruined. Did anybody notice that just before the man in question had a little underwater tug-of-war with Barry (Ryan Phillippe) for Helen's (Sarah Michelle Gellar) princess crown, the man opened his eyes and Barry actually screamed in terror? Given that, I hope I wasn't the only one laughing every time these morons speculated that ""maybe he wasn't really dead..."" HE GRABBED THE CROWN, HELD IT FIRMLY WHILE IT WAS WRENCHED FROM HIS FINGERS, AND OPENED HIS EYES, YOU IDIOTS!!! How could they have been so stupid? Of COURSE he wasn't dead.Besides that, why did he torment these poor kids? They did him a favor! Because of 'what they did last summer,' he is now able to perform superhuman acts. Not only can he survive tremendous bodily harm (in true Michael Myers form), but he can also perform menial tasks like loading and unloading a trunk full of crabs (dead human body optional) in a matter of seconds, and that includes flawless cleaning! Think of the market value of a skill like that! If I were him, I wouldn't be trying to kill anyone, I'd be getting rich! He can also move with superhuman speed, the lucky guy.Oh wait, you gotta hear about another of my favorite parts. Just after the accident, Barry suggests that they dump the body because it won't do any good for them all to take the fall. Julie then reciprocates by saying that if there is some of the man on the car, then there's some of the car on him and when he's found the police will be able to find out whose car it was. How's that again? They can do that? I know that BMWs are nice cars. My uncle owns one, it's an amazing machine. But do they cover those cars with paint which can be used to identify each individual car? Is that what they are suggesting in this scene? Or are they just quickly establishing Julie James as a complete moron as early in the film as possible? She sure was dumb in her cutesy love scene with Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) at the closing of the film. I never thought I'd say this, but this movie had a love story that was even more clumsily thrown in than your average Jerry Bruckheimer film (even more than the ridiculous Coyote Ugly, which made an entire film out of one of these goofy romance flops). ""I wanted you back, Julie. I couldn't lose you again."" ""I feel your pain, Ray."" SHUT UP!! BOTH OF YOU!! I have never seen worse cheese than that in all my life. And yes, she really did say ""I feel your pain."" As is obviously the case, I was ultimately not at all impressed by this movie. I liked it when I was in high school and didn't know any better, but now that my head in on straight, I can see that it is clearly a pathetic attempt to cash in on the seemingly endless stream of teen ""scream"" movies with which the unsuspecting public was bombarded in the late 1990s. If you liked Scream, good for you. It was a good movie. If you want more, stay away from I Know What You Did Last Summer (as well as its equally awful sequel, I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago), and also try to avoid the mediocre Scream sequels. Watch something that is at least moderately entertaining, like Urban Legend (I said entertaining, not original) or The Blair Witch Project. I Know What you Did Last Summer is an honest attempt, but it is also a dismal failure.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

This movie as a nice all-star cast: Freddie Prinze, Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Bridgette Wilson, and Anne Heche. It's a good thing that not all heroines are blondes. The payback for the murder is always grisly. Gellar's character loses half her hair, and everyone else receive threatening letters. And when they say we must fight back? They do. And Julie James(Love Hewitt) is the toughest character in the movie. She does come through in every way.

Helen wins a local beauty contest and the four go to the beach to frolic and celebrate. On the way home with Barry intoxicated and Ray driving, they hit an unknown person on the road. The man appears to be dead so the four agree to cover up the incident and dispose of the body.As they are ready to dump the body into the ocean, Max (Johnny Galecki) drives up. The four feign Barry throwing up to avert suspicion. Max drives away. At the pier, as they are ready to dump the body into the water, they discover that the man is still alive but throw him in any way.Fast forward one year and Julie upon returning home from college for the summer, receives a note stating, you guessed it, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". She goes to the others to warn them. Barry suspects that Max is behind the note and roughs him up. However later, Max is visited by a dark figure wearing a rain slicker and hat covering his face who brutally murders him with a meat hook. Max's demise is not discovered until later.Julie and Helen decide to try and find out who their victim was. He is identified as David Egan. They suspect that perhaps a family member or distraught friend of the dead man are responsible for the threats They go to visit Egan's weird sister Melissa (Anne Heche) who suggests that David was suicidal and perhaps intended to be run over.The killer continues to stalk the four creating fear among them. He even gets into Helen's home and cuts her hair as she slept.. Ray it seems, is not being directly harassed casting suspicion upon him. At the beauty pageant where Helen is to present this year's crown to a new winner, she sees the killer attack Barry in the balcony of the hall. By the time Helen and a policeman reach the scene, there is no trace of either Barry or the killer.The policeman is the killer's next victim as he is trying to drive Helen to safety. The killer then proceeds, in one of the film's more scarier sequences, to chase Helen through the back alleys catching up to her on the edge of the annual July 4th parade. Along the way, he manages to kill Helen's sister Elsa (Bridgitte Wilson-Sampas) when Helen goes to her shop for help. Meanwhile, Julie goes to Ray for comfort but then suspects him as the killer.

Stars: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Anne Heche, Ryan Phillippe, Freddie Prinze Jr.Like many glossy horror films that came in late '90s (The Faculty, Urban Legend, Halloween H20, Bride of Chucky, et. al), I Know What You Did Last Summer followed the blueprint created by Scream to a T. It polished the 'meta' slasher formula with a popular, young cast of TV stars, smart dialogue, and sleek production value.A good portion of its success can be attributed to the script. While the studios were telling every writer to make their horror scripts more like Scream, Columbia went out and got Scream's writer. That said, it's not a mere rehash filled with meta dialogue; Williamson actually wrote this script prior to Scream.I Know What You Did Last Summer is among the most successful films of the post-Scream era in terms of both revenue and fanbase. I watched it mainly for Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar, who at the time were coming into their own as two of the biggest teen stars. I still enjoyed
I Know What You Did Last Summer for what it was - an 80s slasher polished with 90s nu-ness. It holds up surprisingly well. It has some good gore effects.

Okay, that's a little harsh, I thought they both did well with the material they had to work with.

The gore was minimized, and actually that's a positive. (There's not really a lot left to do on that score.) Anne Heche also did as well as could be expected in a small role.

53,drownnnsoda,Slasher Film Class Act.,7,11 July 2006,"""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is about a group of four teenagers, Julie, Ray, Helen, and Barry. One late night on the 4th of July, the teens are partying and driving recklessly along a cliff side near the ocean, when they accidentally hit a fisherman walking across the road. In fear and confusion, they dump the body off a secluded dock and vow to never speak of it again. But the following summer, they begin to get strange letters and people within the small ocean-side community begin to die. It seems that someone knows what happened that night one year ago. Their friendships torn apart after the gruesome accident, the distanced group of once-close friends come together to try and discover the killer's identity, before they become his victims.Honestly, I really enjoyed this movie. After ""Scream"", a whole slew of mediocre to bad slasher movies were released in the '90s, and out of all of them, this is definitely one of the better ones. It's loosely based on Lois Duncan's novel (which I have read), and is much, much different than the actual book was. The writers obviously re-worked the story quite a bit, and while it's nothing like the original story, it is still pretty decent. The novel revolved around some teenagers who accidentally killed a young boy on a bicycle, so this film was quite loosely based on the book. The film has some surprisingly good performances from a slew of upcoming teen actors, including Jennifer Love Hewitt as our lead, Sarah Michelle Gellar as her best friend, and Ryan Phillippe and Freddy Prinze Jr. as their boyfriends. The acting was much better than you'd expect. I'd also like to make not of some great chase sequences that occur in this movie as well. The killer in this film wields a sharp fishing hook (which is a rather original choice for a murderer's weapon) and a creepy, black rain slicker topped with a hat that covers his face - a rather original but menacing costume for a horror villain. The violence isn't gratuitous either - this film does make an attempt to become more of a ""psychological"" slasher film than most of them. The New England fishing-town atmosphere works well here, too.Overall, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is a pretty good slasher movie, considering when it was released and the slew of slashers that were put out during the '90s. It's clichéd in some instances and isn't nearly perfect, but in the world of slasher films, it's a class act. 7/10.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

This is one of my favourites of those 90's slasher flicks, i love the cast & the BRILLIANT atmosphere & music & the excellent small fishing town location setting!!! The movie has a darkness to it,a real sense of dread & with the old worn down looking fishing town makes this a great slasher,the setting is beautiful & similar to the little fishing coastal town in the Fog (1980) so that's a very good thing!!!
Ben Willis is a scary killer too & very iconic & memorable with his wet looking fisherman coat & hook!!! Very cool & menacing looking.
Yeah this movie was a huge summer hit & when i finally brought it on video i loved it & watched it many times on a summer night, a perfect summer time slasher & one of the best made & actually a very well acted proper Thriller with real drama & characters within the slasher parts & that's why this stands up way above most of the rest of the 90's slasher wave, but i think Robert Rodriguez's The Faculty is the best of those.
This was made to be very good & not just another teen killer flick.
Last summer also stands out for having real serious drama & sense of threat,you really feel for the damaged characters & their lives!!!
Other good 90's slashers are of course Scream & Scream 2,The Faculty, Halloween H20 & Urban Legend these stood out as excellent well made slasher films & are all great",I Know What You Did Last Summer

They swear never ever speak of it again, and just move on with their lives. Well, first of all let me just say that I loved Jennifer Love Hewitt in this film, I thought she really fit her role well. I also really loved, probably loved more than all of the characters and actors playing them, was Sarah Michelle Gellar. Sarah Michelle Gellar really did do a great job portraying her role in the film. Then, there's Ryan Phillipe, who I disliked the most of all the actors and characters in the movie, he just was not the correct choice for the role, and basically all he did was just overact and be wayyyyy over the top, it didn't work for him. The plot is interesting and intriguing, at least to me it is. The scare factor is there at certain times in the film, but some ""jump scares"" were just dull and boring.

The film is largely lead by actresses Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar who put their all into their roles. We also have Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr, but their overacting hardly makes for anything memorable throughout the film, or at least anything worthwhile. I feel the story is rather interesting, and the pacing well managed. The cinematography is also excellent, and provides a beautiful and nostalgic backdrop for the film, which just fits perfectly. Where the film largely faults however, is largely due to Scream screenwriter Kevin Williamson who clouds the film with endless cliches and predictable moments- not to mention ridiculous dialogue. The direction is also quite jumpy, trying so hard to be a horror film it can more often than not lose its intended effect. The soundtrack is also rather odd, with its prime range of songs varying from different covers of 60's and 70's hits remade in the 90's- which just doesn't fit at all. In the end, I Know What You Did Last Summer is not a sure-fire hit, but it's a decent watch, and enjoyable for most horror fans alike.

59,Samiam3,What they did last summer has been done before,5,13 July 2009,"I Know What You Did Last Summer is an ideal example of the wrong way to craft a horror- thriller. It has all the stereotypes of a bad slasher flick. The two biggest are uninteresting, cardboard characters portrayed by bad acting, and the second is lack of major suspense. Unless this is your first horror film, you be on the edge of your seat, not from excitement but from the urging desire to walk away.Driving home from a beach party one night, four teenagers accidentally hit a drifter in the middle of the road. After a not very close inspection, he appears to be dead. In a panic, the kids dump his body in the ocean. One year later, the four of them have all gone their separate ways, but one strange event brings them all together. They all receive notes which say 'I know what you did last summer'. And then the murders start to happen.For most of the film, the plethora of boo moments are barely enough to keep you watching, the killers face is kept to the shadows, so you are mildly eager to find out who he is. Come the climax however, you'll be eager for the movie to end. An obnoxious and violent showdown between one of the protagonists and the killer on a boat, becomes the opposite of what it intends to be, dull and unscary. Even if you are a slasher fan, this one should be skipped. I cannot imagine how bad the sequels must be.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

61,Spleen,"Well, the title's pretty good",6,20 August 2000,"""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" joins ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" and ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"" as being yet another film that doesn't even come close to living up to its inspired title.  All are bad enough to make me angry at the thought of a good title being squandered.Kevin Williamson's script suggests nothing so much as a man trying, and failing, to capture the charm of the first couple of seasons of ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" - this is more obviously a good description of ""Scream"", but ""Scream"", and this may surprise some people who've seen it, is better.  -Or maybe he wasn't even trying.  I'm not sure which is worse.  I think Williamson WAS trying for a quality we might term ""cred"", by having his central characters bitch and squabble all the time.  Friends in ""Buffy"", on the other hand, genuinely support one another.  That's a large part of the show's charm.  It's a  charm that could only have helped Williamson's script, if only by making it more realistic: however much his central characters might have fought amongst themselves in the ordinary course of events, faced with a powerful EXTERNAL threat, they would surely have closed ranks.Neither this nor ""Scream"" is particularly bad.  The main trouble is that ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", as well as wasting a good title, also wastes a good premise.  Some teenagers feel guilty after their car accidentally knocks someone down; they hide the body and then they THINK they can just safely sneak back to their old lives ... the story could have gone in many good directions from here, and it's a pity all that occurred to Williamson was to head for regions slasher-horror so well travelled I'm surprised they don't sell souvenirs.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

To begin, the acting is pretty bad. It's amazing how Michelle Gellar and Ryan improved in ""Cruel Intentions"", because here their acting is weak. Prinze Jr's is even worse, and now I understand why ""Scary Movie"" portrayed Ray as gay. He really looks gay here. And who'd thought Leonard from Big Bang Theory was in this film.. I had no idea. The scenes are all very very predictable, I could say what was going to happen even thought this is my first time seeing this (believe it or not). It seems that everybody in this film is blind, deaf and skeptical, like that policeman. When she screamed ""HE IS THE GUY"" or something like that, the cop instead of putting his gun in hands, he preferred to look back for thousand seconds (and die, of course). The only thing to like about this film is the directing and the background sound, that fortunately (or at least) deliver some tense moments.

65,m-47826,Back to basics.,6,16 August 2020,"It's basically Scream's writer's re-reading of old school slashers. Mainly those post-Carpenter's Halloween. No self awareness, close to none pop culture references. Only the story about a group of former friends slashed one by one by a mysterious killer, for sharing a secret they shouldn't have in the first place. Where Scream was good at being a criticism of the genre, this one is added to the list, and could've been another movie Scream universe characters would make fun of on the next sequel. Williamson's skilled writing, and his compelling way of depicting his « slasher movie stereotypes ». Is here to soften the blow. Giving the storyline and its characters more depth than expected. The thing I love the most about this movie, is how the event ruined the heroes bound, only to be mend as they fight for their lives. And everything in between. Unlike Scream, the atmosphere is a lot more unsettling and you wouldn't dare expecting any witty remarks from the victims, let alone the killer. Before getting into action. The casting is pretty iconic, and I wonder if the parts weren't written with them in mind. Julie James is the most compassionate and sensible of the group. And one of my favorite slasher movie heroines. Her boyfriend Ray, is a dweeb, but manages to redeem himself and make me change my mind about him every time. The glamor couple, Barry and Helen, are pretty much what we would expect of characters like these. Only events of the movie make them grow a little. Secondary characters are pretty much red herrings, and potential victims. Only the actors do such a great job, they are given more relevance to the story. We can easily say « I Know what You did Last Summer », is more character development than Scream. Which makes it superior, characterization wise. However, it lacks it smarts, and you see a pattern so early on the movie, it's easy to guess what will happen, who will die and who will survive. Thankfully, it flaws can easily be overlooked, with a good script and cast. Making it one of the best slasher movies of the post Scream era.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

The killer was boring, predictable and not very creepy, the acting was terrible and it seemed to just be trying to draw in cash fast with an audience of teenagers instead of making itself a memorable film.If you're a slasher fan and want something for your collection, check it out, although you may be disappointed.

On the drive back home along the twisting road the Barry's drunken boastful obnoxiousness causes a momentary distraction causing Ray to hit someone. The group are horrified at what's occurred with Julie suggesting they go to the police, but because Barry is intoxicated and the owner of the car and Ray doesn't have the financial and legal resources to fight off a manslaughter charge they're reluctant to get the police involved. Eventually the majority of the group come to the decision throw the body off the harbor into the sea and never discuss the incident again. One year later the group are estranged from one another and involved in their own pursuits, though struggling with them. Julie receives an anonymous letter with only the message ""I know what you did last Summer"". Julie contacts Ray, Barry and Helen and eventually a man dressed in fisherman garb with a hook weapon starts stalking the group who must now uncovered who they killed if they hope to survive.Following Kevin Williamson's breakout hit Scream in 1996, Williamson became a hot commodity in the industry not only being booked by Miramax/Dimension to write the sequel, but also was approached to develop the breakout teen drama Dawson's Creek and had one of his earlier rejected screenplays picked up by up and coming producer Neal H. Moritz. The screenplay in question was I Know What You Did Last Summer a loose adaptation of the young adult novel of the same name by author Lois Duncan that Williamson had unsuccessfully tried to sell prior to his big break. Once Scream hit however, Columbia and Moritz immediately scooped up the rights and rushed the film into production having Williamson put a ""slasher"" spin on the material. Williamson reframed the source book as an homage to 80s slasher films taken particular inspiration from Prom Night and the urban legend ""The Hook"". The movie played up the Scream connection big in the initial advertising prominently announcing the film as being from ""the creator of Scream"" which was not only a sticking point with Williamson, but also instigated legal action from Miramax. Despite the rushed production and legal hurdles I Know What You Did Last Summer became a breakout success upon initial release opening at the top spot and holding it for two additional weekends until it made $124 million against its $17 million budget. The film served as a launch pad for producer Moritz and helped transition Jennifer Love Hewitt from TV to film, and helped cement Williamson's credibility as not another one hit wonder. While the movie definitely helped establish a lot of people, the movie itself is rather mediocre.The biggest asset for the movie is definitely in the casting. Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Ryan Phillippe were the perfect gets for a movie of this type as they're all charismatic attractive appealing leads and it's no surprise why all of them went on to better things. Jennifer Love Hewitt in particular is great playing a role clearly inspired by the likes of the ones Jamie Lee Curtis played in the likes of Terror Train and Prom Night and as a ""Scream Queen"" she does quite well. Even Prinze, Gellar, and Phillippe despite being saddled with very stock roles of ""Nice guy"", ""beauty queen"", and ""muscleheaded jerk"" manage to overcome the stock nature of their characters and bring personality and weight to their performances.What doesn't work is the paper thin narrative that not only deviates from the book and completely misses the spirit of the book, but it falls into the same traps and tropes that were satirized by Scream a mere one year prior and two months later with Scream 2. That's really the biggest issue with I Know What You Did Last Summer in that it takes its familiar framework and plays it straight. On occasion there's some threadbare deconstruction of urban legends like ""The Hook"" but it reeks of studio notes asking ""can we make it more like Scream?"" down to the fact there's a cop character played by veteran character actor Stuart Greer whose character is dumber than David Arquette's Dewey from Scream which at least had the excuse of being satirical. The movie also makes a fatal miscalculation with its impetus with the characters doing a pretty reprehensible thing in not only doing a hit and run, but following up on the hit and run by dumping the body in the ocean. The book is supposed to be a morality play where the characters face punishment for their actions (which in the book were also graver as it was a boy on a bike they killed) but the movie not only isn't all that critical of their actions, it has a twist that basically lets the group off the hook and they never face up to what they did. Even taking into account the ultimate reveal and resolution of what happened, the characters still did or allowed for some pretty terrible actions and the fact they get off scott free (sortof) plays kind of wrongheaded which is probably another reason why the book's author didn't care for this movie.I Know What You Did Last Summer has value as a minor curiosity in regards to the careers of its stars, producer, and writer and sometimes can be enjoyed for the high camp factor, but aside from that it's a pretty forgettable bare basics slasher with a heavy coat of 90s polish. If you want to see a better version of this kind of movie there's plenty in the 80s that are either bad enough to be funny or good enough to be an enjoyable sit. I Know What You Did Last Summer is too well acted and constructed to be enjoyed ironically but it's also not smart or intense enough to be worth viewing for its own sake. It's just a middle of the road ""meh"" movie.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

I don't feel that it is particularly derivative (I grew up with the original ""Halloween"", etc.), at least no more so than most movies in general. I actually liked the rather low production values--they just seemed to make the right atmosphere for this particular film. It's also at least as much a mystery/thriller as an actual horror movie.

The acting wasn't anything great, but it wasn't bad either, and certainly better than most network TV. By modern standards, the gore isn't that gory, it's much more a mood thing, and a pretty effective one at that.

Knowing that if anyone else finds out what happened they'll be in deep trouble, they decide to dump the body and never speak of it again. Next summer, after they have come back from college, someone claims they know what happened that fateful summer night a year ago. Someone who is apparently very angry. Someone who has a nasty hook and knows how to use it.At first this seems like an intriguing premise - the naughty kids getting their due and since the naughty kids are the principle characters, it puts the viewer right into the middle of the film's suspense. However this pretty good opening, which could have made a nice genre entry, soon dissolves into an poorly directed and down right boring film.First off, the film's body count is very disappointing. It makes sense since the killer is targeting specific people, but the counter-part, the character's psychological terror of being hunted and their own conflicts between themselves is hardly convincing. As a result the film feels like it was shot with a screenplay that had many pages torn out. Second, the ""strong horror violence"" promised by the MPAA is remarkably limited making only quick cut appearances which become very poorly directed by the end with generic angle and reverse angle shots. That essentially ruins the film right there - boring carnage and unconvincing psychological terror make for a poor horror film. 3/10Rated R: slasher violence and profanity",I Know What You Did Last Summer

Gellar was given a lot of film time in the movie, but all the scenes were enjoyable as she wasn't over the top girly, but not super brave either. Instead she was a normal girl doing the best she could in the circumstances she was put into.

Now, this wasn't very well received by the critics as they called it a pure rip-off and completely unoriginal. Well, maybe that's true and maybe the script was written in only a couple of days, but this slasher flick is still a great timewaster. There's really not much of a story in this one, a bunch of teens get stalked and killed by a disguised killer, very by-the-books but there's one thing that many people seem to forget; slashers do not have to be original to be entertaining! The movie moves quickly forward and even though the body count is relatively low, there's always something there to keep us interested in the story.Just like in Scream we have a big name cast with Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddy Prinze Jr. Naturally we get great performances from all of these actors. What most people don't seem to remember is that these actors really became big AFTER this movie. I guess most actors start out in horror movies though as it is a good and easy way to get your name out there. The directing is also very nice and you can tell that they spent a whole lot of money making this flick which is nice since I love high budget slashers. This is one of those slashers that will go to the history so this should definitely be in your collection by now.All in all A slasher that will probably never be forgotten. I'm almost positive every horror fan has seen this movie and I sure hope you have. It's clichéd, it's unoriginal and it's uninspired but damn is this flick entertaining!

83,Darkside-Reviewer,I know what movie you ripped off last summer!,5,23 December 2020,"I finally decided to review (I Know What You Did Last Summer) (1997) after watching the newly released Blu Ray remasters of the I Know What You Did Last Summer movie trilogy. I first saw this movie on VHS in the early 2000s when I was teenager and at the time I just laughed the movie off as a silly slasher movie that you watch with your friends on a Saturday night. As I got older I started collecting old horror and slasher movies especially ones from the 80s and 90s but the I know What You Did Last Summer movies never really got a decent transfer from VHS to DVD it wasn't until recently that the trilogy finally got a remaster collection on Blu Ray with all the special features.The story follows a group of four teenagers who accidentally run over a man while partying and driving in the middle of knowhere. The four of them make a pact to dump the body in the river and move on with their lives and to never speak of it again. One year later they each receive a message saying ""I know What You Did Last Summer"". The four are forced together again to figure out who is messing with them and put a stop to it once and for all but it isn't long before the bodies start piling up and it won't be long until they are each hung up on a fishhook for what they did.(I know What You Did Last Summer) isn't remembered for being a particularly good slasher movie the reason it became so memorable was because of Scream which was released just one year prior to this movie in 1996. The movie's poster even promotes the movie as ""By the makers of Scream"" thats one of the only reasons people were interested in this movie when it came out because everyone thought it was basically just going to be like Scream and that pretty much sums this movie up in a nutshell. Scream breathed some new life back into the horror/slasher movie genre with it's unique satire on the cliques of slasher movies Screams use of meta humour quickly caught on with other slasher movies and this began the new slasher movie craze of the late 90s and early 2000s.This is a who done it? Kind of movie ""again"" similar to Scream only this time around the reveal at the end will have you asking yourself ""Eh who are they again?"" rather than making you gasp in disbelief. The movie does however have an interesting cast starring (Jennifer Love Hewitt) who plays the main character Julie James this is one of her earlier roles when she was shy but cute. (Sarah Michelle Gellar) plays Helen Shivers. I was a massive fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer growing up so I just kept expecting her character to drive a stake through the killers heart. (Johnny Galecki) also has a small role in the movie in his younger years before his big break came playing Leonard on The Big Bang Theory if your not a big Leonard fan then you'll pleased to know his character in this movie is killed off in pretty gory fashion which always fun to see fan or no fan of Galecki.The kills in this movie are pretty decent admittedly there aren't many death scenes in the movie but the kills we do get are pretty good. The killer in this movie uses a fishhook as a weapon which is kind of similar to Candymans hook hand but the kills are still memorable and gory.I recommend buying the Blu Ray collection of the (I Know What You Did Last Summer) trilogy. All three movies have been given the full 1080p HD upgrade with a 16.9 wide-screen aspect ratio. Subtitles have also been added to the movies aswell as a bunch of special features well worth the money if you love these kinds of movies.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
84,moviesleuth2,Surprisingly good,8,25 June 2010,"When this movie came out, I desperately wanted to see it, but for the life of me I cannot understand why. Thirteen years later, I finally got around to seeing it. It was NOTHING like I was expecting.""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was a teenage psychological thriller written by Lois Duncan, but Columbia Pictures turned it into a slasher movie on screen. This infuriated Duncan, whose teenage daughter was brutally murdered in 1989 (as of today, the case remains unsolved). It's a shame, because these changes hurt an already effective suspense thriller.Four high school friends, Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) celebrate their last summer together. On the way home, they accidentally hit a someone. Not wanting to give up their promising futures, they dump the body into the water, intending to carry the secret to their graves. One year later, it becomes clear that someone knows what happened.People have been calling this a slasher film, and really, this just isn't the case. For a would-be member of this genre, there's surprisingly little violence, and almost no gore to speak of (the film still deserves its R rating, however, because what violence there is, is pretty intense). The film fits better into the psychological thriller genre, and that's a good thing, because the story is the strongest part of the film.The acting is surprisingly good. All the actors are able to show the effects of keeping a secret like this. None of their lives has turned out the way they thought they would, and their friendships are at best estranged. It's an interesting exploration that is often left ignored in most films of this ilk, especially ones geared towards teens. The actors are good enough to make this credible, and as such, it adds a level of verisimilitude to the film.I was surprised at how effective this film was. Based on his later film, ""D-Tox,"" Jim Gillespie appeared to have absolutely no talent in creating tension. This movie is consistently suspenseful, and the ending surprised me (then again, I am notoriously bad at guessing whodunits beforehand).""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" has been compared to ""Scream,"" which was also written by Kevin Williamson (this film was written before ""Scream,"" but was only put to film after ""Scream's"" blockbuster success). Altogether they are different movies. ""Scream"" is a horror movie through and through; this is a suspense story with horror film elements.Because of the film's other successes (such as the aforementioned exploration of the characters' relationships post-trauma), I was going to give the film an 8 despite the suspense not being as high as some other films I have given the same rating. But the final scene is horrible. Not only does it not make sense, it completely abandons the credible mental stress that was present throughout the previous 90 minutes.Still, I highly recommend the film, even if you're not a slasher film fan.Rated R for some Strong Violence and Language.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

But their are a few things that kind of spoil what could have been a fairly decent movie. The deaths in this aren't very gory or interesting, which is needed for a slasher. The ending is really bad and of course, led way to the sequel, I Still Know, which was one of the worst movies ever made.

They freak out as a result and in the process decide not to go to the police. Instead, they dump the body into the ocean and pretend that nothing happened. Big mistake. A year later, the four teens get a wake up call when one of them gets a bizarre note saying I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. The one behind this dastardly plot is a man who dresses up in a fisherman's outfit and weaves a lethal gapping hook that he uses in an attempt to kill the four teens. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar are very good in the female leading roles, so is Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. as the male leads. ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" can be stupid at times, but the performances by Hewitt, Gellar, Phillippe, and Prinze make up for that. Not to mention, there are some truly scary moments.

And while it's true both guy parts are nothing special, Phillipe and Prinze are pretty bad, so you don't care at all what happens to them.

99,bh_tafe3,Cashing in on Scream...,6,8 March 2010,"...and not doing a bad job of it either.It's 1997. Wes Craven and to a lesser extent Joss Whedon have just reinvigorated the horror genre with the film Scream and the television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. So what to do if you're a big movie studio wanting a fast hit? You make a horror movie and cast Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar, as one of the leads. The result is a nice little film, borrowing from the Scream formula of winking at the audience and MTV casting.The plot: four friends, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt (Julie), Ryan Phillipe (Barry), Buffy (Helen) and Freddie Prinz Jr (Ray), go out on a boozy evening drive following 4th of July celebrations in their sleepy little city. On the way home they accidentally hit a man with their car, killing him, and then dump his body in the ocean. A year later Julie starts getting mysterious messages reading ""I know what you did last summer."" As the bodies mount panic increases as Julie, Ray, Barry and Helen try to find out who it is that ""knows."" The cast: Phillipe and Gellar are the best actors in this movie and unsurprisingly, it's their scenes which generate the most emotion. Phillipe in particular, you'll feel like strangling as his macho stupidity gets the team in trouble at every turn. Gellar starts off as a selfish character but her plight does generate some sympathy. Hewitt plays a stereotypical horror heroine, while Prinz puts in a typical Freddie Prinz performance, for what that's worth. Johhny Galecki drops in for his typical odd ball effort and actually adds something to the film, while Muse Watson, the villain of the piece is not given much to do.The script: again it follows the Scream formula of not taking itself too seriously. There are many scenes which are purposefully ridiculous, such as our very slowly walking villain gaining ground on our sprinting heroes, and a silly resolution when we find out who the killer is.Overall: this is a genre film that offers nothing new and is far from essential viewing. Having said that, it is entertaining in spots with some nice kills. I know what you did last summer, while not quite standing tall, does stand as a solid example of late 90s slasher film making. There have been many worse.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
100,Mort-31,Almost good,7,6 April 2001,"It was an interesting experiment of Kevin Williamson to transfer Scream` into a not so trashy, ironic and light atmosphere. The question here is not only: Who is going to be killed next, but also: Who is the mysterious fisherman and what happened really that night? This is more than a horrorfilm: it's a whodunnit and a horrorfilm. Actually, it's not much more.In my opinion, I Know What You Did Last Summer` could have been much more interesting, much more suspenseful, if that stupid image of the dark man with the hook hadn't ruled the movie. The pictures of the house in the forest, Missie's character and the death of Egan's girlfriend are gruesome enough.On the other hand, Williamson is too serious. One year after the accident, everybody is absolutely down, none of them made the career they wanted, their life is ruined. I don't believe that. And don't tell me, this is not the kind of movie one believes.

101,jayjaycee,Hooked on this guilty pleasure of mine,6,6 July 2020,"""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is a 1997 mystery horror film directed by Jim Gillespie starring Jennifer Love-Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar. To this day, the subgenre of slasher films is still one of the most popular among horror fans. Back in the day, John Carpenter's masterpiece ""Halloween"" reached a whole new level in the making of horror films, and as it is always the thing with ground-breaking ideas, inspired several others to follow his path and produce films that based their existence on the success of the classic from seventy-eight. Even if the influence of the original masterwork is painfully palpable in all of them and makes them all appear like cheap cash grabs, a handful of titles still reached the status of being cult classics, nevertheless. Next to Cunningham's beloved lakeside slaughterer flick ""Friday The 13th"" (which I famously dislike a lot) there was also Wes Craven's dream assassin gore fest ""Nightmare On Elm Street"", but after the success of both of those films, only dozens of mediocre to terrible sequels were produced and hit the big screen. Except for them, the genre slowly seemed to have died out and there was no title that could live up to the success of the original films. Only until Craven singlehandedly revived the whole genre with the more or less self-aware genre flick ""Scream"". The triumph that this film was marked the rebirth of an infamous subgenre that was considered dead for years. The mid-nineties were the renaissance of the teenage slashers and the natal hour of the neo-slasher genre. As it has been the case roughly twenty years prior, the success of a hit film sparked a new wave of cheap copies and innumerable sequels. While the titles from this era don't reach the quality of the films of their parental generation, I still got to say that I have penchant for those cheap flicks, but I think that it is a matter of the generational divide. Those films are too blasphemous for the generation that witnessed the birth of the original films and lack the blood and graphic imagery for the current youth. Those films are all unique in a cheap way and I appreciate them for the mindless fun they bring me. Aside from genre sibling ""Urban Legend"" (which is undeniably messy yet enjoyable), I am a professed apologist of this cheap flick from ninety-seven. It cannot be denied that it is nothing but mediocre in terms of cinematic brilliance, but a title that has a lot of decent approaches and elements that make it stand out in direct comparison to its genre siblings. First of all, we have the crème de la crème of nineties teenage heartthrobs gathered in the leading roles. Next to future ""Ghost Whisperer"" lead actress Love-Hewitt and ""Buffy - The Vampire Slayer"" superstar SMG, we got glamour boy Phillipe and crush boy Prinze Jr. in one of their earlier roles that made them extraordinarily popular among the teenage generation. Well, their performances range from acceptable to questionable. SMG is by far the most talented of the four (and I just don't say it because I adore BTVS) and nails the role of the stupid blonde (the total opposite of Buffy) decently, Phillipe once again manages to become the conceited prick (boy, I hope it is only a matter of typecasting, for I am slowly beginning to have the impression that he doesn't really act much), JLH is acceptable in the leading role, even if she could have done better at times, but by far the worst of them all is FPJr. I am not even sure if it is the lack of talent or the poor writing of his character that makes him appear so dilettante, but the way he appears on screen is almost ridiculous. He is like me back in math exams: utterly confused and seemingly not knowing what is going on. His performance channels some minor Mark Wahlberg in ""The Happening"" vibes and even if he isn't as lost as him in that film, he still compares unfavourably to his co-stars. Fortunately, he doesn't have that much screen time, except for the final act. What I enjoy most about this film is how it in fact manages to create a decent atmosphere. A small coastal town that seems to have ears and eyes and celebrates Independence Day? Call me a madman, but I always get in the right mood when I watch it in summer and it really grabs me immediately. Furthermore, I think the film is anything but completely predictable and successfully sets the viewer on the wrong track several times, as well as plays some serious mind games with them. The true identity of the murderer isn't clear until the revelation and it also doesn't really exclude that the killer is not a supernatural force or undead avenger. Even if he isn't as famous as Jason or Michael, the hook wielding fisherman with the slicker remains somewhat iconic for its generation and somehow reminds me of Mr. X from ""Resident Evil 2"". Aside from the psychological horror it plays with the viewer, the film also has some moral (never try to cover up what you have done wrong) for the audience that gives it some sort of an urban legend flair. Speaking of which, the characters mention enough of them to make the viewer feel unpleasant throughout and as one can see, they all deeply suffer from what they have done and they are all traumatised and haunted, instead of following their dreams and living out there desires. Over the whole course, the film is actually smarter than one might have expected and cares a lot about conceptualising a story that stands out in comparison to its genre siblings, but even if it is more clever than others it is still no Willow Rosenberg of slasher films. Most of the time it is so close to not being formulaic, but in the end it still doesn't get along without accessing the genre typical tropes and cheesy plot devices. At times it even desperately wants to appear intelligent and eclectic but achieves the total opposite and ends up being extremely confusing and doesn't make any sense at all. For instance, what is the point of the whole ""Billy Blue"" thing that wasn't furtherly mentioned? Also, stupid deaths and incompetent behaviour of trained policemen are one of the party as well. The whole stupidity reaches its climax in the final act after Julie finds out that fisherman Willis is the man behind the cloak and hook, and the whole scene is nothing but hilariously embarrassing. Oh, and don't even get me started about the power couple getting together again and the man masked killer jumping out of the shower in the final shot. That was the biggest piece of garbage in this actually enjoyable flick. All in all, this film is an undeniably mediocre yet utterly entertaining entry into the genre of neo-slashers. With a decent cast and a surprisingly mysterious atmosphere it manages to deliver decent fun and follows the path of its paternal films. It established JLH and SMG as new era scream queens and has a story different than the average copycat, even if it is nothing but another rip-off in the end. The kills are less original and not as gory as some might have wanted it, but it focusses more on establishing a decent story instead, and that is anything but terrible. Not really predictable but not shocking either, full of stereotypes and tropes, yet utterly enjoyable in its own cheap way. I know what I did last summer: I had a lot of fun with this flick, and I also had much pleasure with it this year, and so will I next year. One of my favourite guilty pleasures, it is rewatchable as hell and a decent title in the genre. I am literally hooked on this flick (pun intended) and hence give it a generous rating.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

It is loosely based on the 1973 novel of the same name by Lois Duncan and is the first installment in I Know What You Did Last Summer trilogy. The film centers on four young friends who are stalked by a hook-wielding killer one year after covering up a car accident in which they killed a man. The film also draws inspiration from the urban legend known as the Hook, and the 1980s slasher films Prom Night (1980), and The House on Sorority Row (1982).This is one of my all-time favourite horror movies. For me, this is up there with the likes of Scream and Halloween. The film is suspenseful and fun which is everything that's missing from horror films nowadays. Whereas Scream relied heavily on self-conscious references and its pop culture veneer, Last Summer was a throwback to the slasher films of the early '80s. While, like Scream, it employed the services of a group of young, sexy and almost impossibly good-looking actors, Last Summer played its horror straight.

But ""I Saw What You did Last Summer"" doesn't even has that; the psycho is somebody we don't know or better someone who saw the kids do what they did and comes for them, but there's no surprise on who he turns out to be or why he kills them.

110,Jerique,I Know What You Did Last Summer - The Review,1,19 August 2007,"After watching Cruel Intentions, I got in the mood for I Know What You Did Last Summer. However, I really wished I didn't, since I now realize that this movie is undoubtedly the worst horror of all time.Jennifer Love-Hewitt is nothing short of a horrible actress. Not only is she completely inept but her lines were delivered with little or no emotion. I felt no connection to her performance and everything she did do seemed forced and unnecessary. She is not the worst thing in the film overall -- at least she is eye candy and easy to look at.Sarah Michelle Gellar is pretty much the only reason to watch this and actually find a sense of enjoyment. She good to look at for appearance but she also delivers the best performance, regardless of being such a pointless role. Her involvement is the only good thing about the film.Ryan Phillippe is a horrible choice as Barry, still he was also horrible in the role itself. It's not hard to play 'asshole' characters who refuse to do the right thing. But somehow Ryan was unable to pull it off. He tried too hard as well as coming off whiny and annoying. I couldn't wait for his character to die.Freddie Prinze Jr., is not a horrible actor but his role is useless. I couldn't even begin to guess Freddie's reasons as to taking such a horrible role. His character was boring on top it also seemed like the dumbest one of all - and Sarah plays a blonde. He also has a look of not understanding throughout the entire film. Whoever directed him through this film is nothing short of a horrible director.With the actors out of the way, lets discuss the movie.Firstly, the dialogue is poorly written but the lines are also delivered with so little emotion it's difficult to even watch the actors make an attempt. All the lines written are more than cheesy, they are just inane. Scary Movie's parodied version at least gives us the satisfaction of laughs. What does I Know What You Did Last Summer give? Secondly, the killer is unrealistic. The guy is rigorous and somehow it's almost too... convenient. Even when this guy isn't trying he still succeeds to be unnoticed. The death scenes and other scenes with him are so unrealistic and illogical I felt like yelling at the screen. Themurders themselves are not even the same level of excitement as Scream, Friday the 13th or Halloween's. When people watch movies like this you should leave the theater/room feeling like you've learned something from the experience of it so you can protect yourself or defend yourself if the situation arose. At least they should show that a killer, especially a human one like this, can make mistakes. But he doesn't.Thirdly, and finally, when you watch a movie, you're supposed to feel a connection for the characters. I did not care for any of the characters dying and the killer didn't excite me and I sometimes find myself for cheering for the killers -- this time I wasn't. I was booing the entire movie. If there is no connection to the characters, the movie fails. Anyone who finds this movie remotely interesting or exciting, please explain. There is absolutely nothing exciting in this movie. At least some horror films have comedy mixed with drama, thrills and suspense. Where's the comedy? No comedic relief as far as I can tell. What a pointless movie.The characters were poorly written, the direction was nothing more than something that a high school student could've done. The shots and slow editing was not a good addition. In fact, every shot I felt as if went on forever. It made the pace of the movie slow. Unrealistic, predictable, and completely dumb - to say the least - are all valid reasons to never watch this again. They are also reasons of listing this in the top 5 worst movies of all-time as well as the top worst horror movie of all-time. I'm never watching this movie again.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
111,happyendingrocks,Something stinks here... and it isn't all the dead fish,5,20 October 2009,"I'm probably being too generous with a 5 here, because I Know What You Did Last Summer is so utterly stupid that it isn't really all that enjoyable unless you decide to turn your brain off and allow the rote slasher elements play out without asking any questions. If you can manage this, you'll likely enjoy yourself throughout this mess. However, if you want actual scares or plot twists that make sense, it might be best to sit this one out. I assure you, you're life won't be any less complete if you do.To be fair, this is a somewhat enjoyable offering, assuming that you're willing to settle for a few gruesome images and a slickly made production. The story is nifty enough, though unoriginal, and for most of the running time, it seems to be building to a thrilling climactic revelation. However, several elements here simply don't make sense, and a few scenes are just so idiotic that even laughing seems like a waste of breath. Perhaps the most famous scene in the film, Jennifer Love Hewitt's ""what are you waiting for!?"" moment, is so poorly-acted and ridiculous that it pretty much cancels out any tension built up to that point. We also have to deal with a killer whose prowess for stage magic makes David Blaine look like a sissy. Our resourceful Gorton Man impersonator pulls off the amazing feat of making a water-logged corpse and dozens of king-size crabs disappear from the trunk of Hewitt's car without a trace in roughly two minutes, managing to not even leave behind a hint of moisture. While it is amusing to picture our skulking killer moving at lightning speed to remove the cargo and detail Hewitt's trunk with a Wet-Vac, any chance of us taking this thing seriously pretty much die right there.Up until then, we at least get a decent little mystery building, and a couple of pretty cool kill scenes for our trouble. But, as we settle into the killer's sadistic plot, the film really starts to run out of steam.For one, we have to ponder why, if the killer is setting out to get revenge on the kids who ran him over, he would choose someone who had nothing to do with the accident as his first victim. Sure, this turns out to be the best death scene in the film, but since there's ultimately no point to it, it doesn't have nearly as much punch as it should.Now, this is the part that's really hard to wrap the head around... We know the killer's plot: kill off the four guilty parties one at a time and get revenge, right? But we have to question why the killer would attack two of them and let them live just to turn around and finish the job a couple of days later. Wouldn't it have been easier to just do it the first time? For that matter, wouldn't it have made more sense to hit them while they were unaware, instead of sending them notes and clues and stalking them for days before getting around to the revenge part? As the scenario plays out, we get tossed a few more extra victims who are killed for no apparent reason, except to ensure a big enough body count to make the movie interesting while still leaving enough of the four stars alive for the inevitable sequel. Each of these murders is so brazenly choreographed that they don't have much impact, although the sight of the killer carrying Sarah Michelle Gellar's sister around impaled on a hook is a cool and grisly little scene. Most of the other attempted scares fail due to the same mindless logic that drives the film, such as a parade scene where we discover that dozens of people in this particular town wear identical black fishing gear when they go to parades, and that they zip up their jackets in an identical manner that keeps their faces covered. I'm thinking it's probably hard to watch a parade with the collar of a fishing slicker covering your eyes, but in fairness, I will admit that I've never worn one. Perhaps they have eye-holes cut into the collars? Though the film attempts a series of dicey twists to jolt the tepid ending to life, the aforementioned ""thrilling climax"" is dead in the water (a good pun, if you've seen the film) when the killer is revealed to be... someone we've never seen before. So much for the big reveal. The final showdown with the hook-toting madman is completely anti-climactic because our remaining protagonists settle for getting rid of him the exact same way they did at the beginning of the film... Which, you know, didn't kill him. Which, you know, set off this whole chain of events to begin with. Which, you know, pretty much ensures the sequel guaranteed by the mile-visible denouement.There have been two of those to date (I think), but the limited appeal of IKWYDLS is bound to dry up pretty quickly with diminishing returns, so I think we're off the hook for now (Ha! Get it? ""Off the hook""? Because the killer uses a hook? Forget it...).Kevin Williamson was hailed as a genius after Scream, but this film is proof positive that one good movie doesn't necessitate making properties out of every script that writer was unable to sell before their breakthrough. Here's hoping every avenue of this killer fisherman tale has been exhausted.But, as a cynic, I'm still willing to bet that before too long the direct-to-DVD market will deliver us By The Way, I'm Still Keenly Aware Of The Events You Participated In Several Summers Ago. Can't hardly wait... (Get it? Because Jennifer Love Hewitt was in that movie too? Okay, I'm over it...).",I Know What You Did Last Summer

117,AwesomeWolf,Terrible,1,1 November 2005,"'I Know What You Did Last Summer' is one of those movies I was told avoid, and because of that warning, went out of my way to watch it. I have no one to blame but myself. Even by slasher standards, 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' is stupid, boring, and insulting.The premise is that four teenagers (who are generally rich and beautiful people) run a man over, and apparently kill him. Displaying a callous disregard for human dignity while trying to protect themselves, they dump the body in the ocean, and make a pact never to talk about it again. One year later, Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) receives a note indicating that someone knows all about the hit & run, and wants to off the group of self-serving brats.I don't know how this crap managed to become so popular. It is a terrible movie, all based upon the fact that we're supposed to sympathize with these beautiful teens, even after they've killed someone and dumped his body in the ocean. No dice. If I was the guy they ran over, I'd be pretty ticked off too. A good horror movie should make you feel for, and sympathize with the characters in peril, but these kids are annoying, shallow, and have already covered up manslaughter - why should I sympathize with them? If anything, they're getting what they deserve.Aside from that, IKWYDLS is obvious and boring. All the slasher clichés are present, but there are no surprises at all. The standard red herrings turn up, but shouldn't fool any avid horror fan (or anyone else for that matter). The cast are not convincing at all, especially Freddy Prinze Jr. He looked rather bored, although I suspect that may be the product of a lack of acting talent.'I Know What Did Last Summer' is a terrible film, even by slasher standards, and is insulting to intelligence (though it takes a certain lack of intelligence to consider watching this.

It is an epic film from start to finish, with the first shot being one of the most epic opening shots ever on screen (which is a long drawn out helicopter shot that then becomes a close up). It is really well done with great writing and acting from some of the greatest TV actors of the 90's. And it is not a predictable movie either and thus it makes you jump a lot right up to the very end. The score is really well done and raises suspense & tension and helps create thrills. And it is a really scary movie for a slasher film. Also featuring a new and unique murder weapon that we've never seen before in the movies, a hook! I think it is the most well done of all the slasher films, and the scariest too! I'm not sure why it hasn't gotten better ratings. For a Horror film, especially in its genre, I'd give it a 10.

119,bayardhiler,"A Fun, if not Perfect, 90's Teen Slasher Flick",7,1 September 2016,"""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". It sounds like one of the corniest threats ever or one of the worst ways to make conversation, doesn't it folks? But that's the name of the Kevin Williamson written 1997 teen slasher pick starring youthful actors Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prince Jr. The plot of the film has already been mentioned by many on this site, so I won't spend too much time on it here, except to say four teens living in small fishing hamlet decide to celebrate their high school graduation by (what else?) getting drunk and making out on the beach and on their way back, accidentally hit a man along the road and seemingly kill him. Rather than do the right thing and report the accident to the cops, the four decide to cover it up by dumping the man in the ocean and making a pact to never talk about it ever again, which would be fine, perhaps, if one year later someone wasn't sending out letters with the film's title on it! Who is stalking the teens? Is it someone who saw them dump the body or is it possible the person they hit wasn't really dead? Made one year after Williamson's other written (and quite spectacularly, I might add) ""Scream"", it's a movie that tried to capitalize on the spirit of that clever, self-parodying thriller, and while I can't say it fully succeeded, there's something about ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" that I can't help but fall in love with. Perhaps this is one of those cases where the time period a film was made in overcompensates whatever flaws the story has - such as various plot holes, the fact that some of the characters are not particularly likable (Ryan Phillippe's rich kid quarterback character comes to mind), or the fact that the killer, when revealed, doesn't have quite the same impact Ghostface or Michael Myers had. Indeed, hearing the 90's soundtrack blaring over the film's scenes instantly makes me think of the better, more carefree days of when I was a kid, when the only thing you had to worry about was what new blockbuster was coming out and who the President of the United States was sleeping with! Or maybe it's because of the fact that the four leads have such great chemistry together I just can't help but stay put and watch. Whatever, the reason, ""I know What You Did Last Summer"" is one of those slightly cheesy films that will appeal to a certain audience, and even for those it doesn't, at the very least they'll have delicious eye candy in the form of Hewitt or Gellar, or if you're a woman, Phillippe and Prince. Regardless of what others might think, for me this is a film that's fun to look back on, if for nothing, a time capsule of better times.

122,Dragoneyed363,"A classic, very underrated slasher",9,16 April 2008,"When the era of teen slashers started to arise from the incredible success of Scream, it seemed a lot of them were just so not up to par as Scream was, and still are not to this day. Scream was a fast paced, amazingly well crafted classic with excellent characters and acting, and a wonderful plot. However, there are quite a few slashers in that time that have cult followings from horror lovers for they are very enjoyable slashers, that tried their best to conquer Scream implacably. I Know What You Did Last Summer falls under that category for me. True, this movie did also help in the creation of the disastrous string of teen horrors we have nowadays, with cliché plot twists and face- palming character actions at every turn, but it is arguably the most successful and recognized Scream cash-in, and there is a reason for that.I especially love the cast. Though Jennifer Love Hewitt is no Neve Campbell, she and the rest of her co-stars, Prince Jr., Phillipe and the ever so wonderful and amazingly talented Sarah Michelle Gellar all try their best to make the film work for what it is and accomplish that perfectly. Sarah Michelle Gellar's character Helen actually has a very wide fan base, and I am a considered fan as well. Her character was superb; too bad she was overshadowed by the film's genre by a lot of critics and was ridiculously killed off quite aggrivatingly. Anyway, stopping the drooling and praising over Ms. Gellar, the plot is fun and probably my favorite ""we make a pact"" plot that I have seen. It has some nice kills, and though Ben Willis is no Ghostface, I make these Scream references for the screenplay was by Kevin Williamson and we all know that is what this film tried to be, he is not a bad killer, just not a memorable one. He is not as memorable as the film itself, for me at least.Anyway, the movie is just pure fun with characters that you actually care for and hope to live; surprisingly deep characters in fact for such a short running time and the ""genre-based"" film that it is. It was a box office success and I can see why; definitely one of my all time favorite slashers, even if it's not one of the best, and does not receive the appreciation it deserves at a lot of times. I assume it is mostly criticized because of the genre it is in, like I mentioned, and not many critics and general audiences are open to teen slashers, I can see why with the ones we have nowadays, but this was the 90s; an excellent decade for films of any genre, and many people should acknowledge that.

125,refinedsugar,Horrible,1,14 March 2001,"Popular horror films have always been responsible for the spawning of really bad imitations and clones. It's a fact. So flash forward to 1996 and there's Scream with it's acclaimed pop culture references as it goes on to rake in quite the sum of dough. Suddenly horror movies are hot property again. Popular, in vogue, and yet again, another wave of really bad imitations looking to cash in are unleashed on us ... and perhaps the worst?Written by Scream scribe Kevin Williamson, 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' is a movie absolutely void of anything redeeming in my book. It's not scary, it's not entertaining. The title literally tells the tale of how four stereotypical teens (acting like all ill-responsible teens do in movies of this sort) accidentally kill a man with their car. They make a pact to keep it secret except (oops) someone knows. Soon they get letters with the self-entitled words ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and I'm left to assume the letters are coming from that dude in a rain slicker walking around with a fish hook. Only the makers of this film know how we're supposed to care about any of the main characters. How can we be rightfully sympathetic towards them after they kill someone and hide it? Have I missed something here? It's not like their awful personalities are winning me over. When they are faced with certain death, I didn't care. When some of them meet their gruesome demise, I didn't care. See a pattern here? I seriously doubt it was the intention to make the killer an anti-hero too. This flick is so pedestrian in its making and execution that it couldn't think outside of the box if it's life depended on it.Scenes are telecast from miles away. There's a foray of stalking, red herrings, extended chase sequences, girls screaming loudly and the killer who can disappear and reappear inhumanly fast.

It's not too bad, basically a simple moralistic tale, executed in a very basic slash'n'stalk way. Highlights include the cameo appearance of Anne Heche; the edge-of-the-seat chase scene in which Sarah Michelle Gellar's character is hunted down towards the end; and the very trendy soundtrack, which includes the popular song ""Hush"" - a song which has practically become this movie's theme.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
138,BlueSkies765,Nostalgic classic,10,23 June 2020,This movie was really great back in the 90s. Mid 90s Scream revived the slasher genre. A lot of slashers where made. The trend of continued for quite some time when it started to slow down early 2010s when movies like Insidious and Conjuring made paranormal movies popular again.I Know What You Did Last Summer was always in the shadow of Scream. Scream was smart. Reviving the genre while giving commentary on the genre. The people loved it. This movie felt more formulaic. Yet when we talk about horror movies in the 90s everyone remembers this movie. It had the 90s vibes. Bratty teens stuck in a crazy situation. Living in a small harbor town (with atmospheric music to match it) being stalked on the 4th of July by a weird man in a raincoat with a fishing hook in his hand. This movie got so much personality how can you not love it? If you watched it back then you loved it and you'll love it now for the nostalgia.,I Know What You Did Last Summer

140,gila_film,A modern-classic! Watch this for sure.,8,20 April 2004,"A bloody revenge is occur when a group of teen accidentally hit a man and dumps his body into the sea a year before. Now, seek for revenge, the man seem awaken from the dead and gain for more than apology. The dynamic casts; Jennifer Love-Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Ryan Philippe, star as the convict target of revenge. As a moderate classic in the genre, `I Know What You Did Last Summer (IKWYDLS)' is another posh-Scream great slasher. Written by the same man behind Scream, Kevin Williamson, IKWYDLS is a pure fright machine that guarantee will satisfy fans of the genre.As now many imitators came out already, IKWYDLS is seem as one of the best. Thanks to uninventive and unimaginative of its directors that blatantly copy IKWYDLS or Scream as their template. Came a long with Urban Legend, IKWYDLS is a great treatment in the genre right after Scream. Many people claims that IKWYDLS just want to pursue the success of Scream to expand money as much as it can, but the result is emerge as good as a slasher can be. The creepy ambience is there, the plot is interwoven with the genre structure well enough and the most important thing, there's a healthy amount of strong horror violence despite not so much inventive. We never bore by the scenes and the plot's tension is gradually raise. Definitely an-edge-of-your-seat-thriller. I watched it numerous times and always enjoying all the epoch.
IKWYDLS also cast a group of talented actors. Jennifer Love-Hewitt (Can't Hardly Wait), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Scream 2), Freddie Prinze Jr. (She's Like That) and Ryan Philippe (Cruel Intentions), now become great stars. Jennifer as `Party of Five' veteran and Sarah as the though vampire slayer in `Buffy' know what were they dealing with and played their role respectfully. The male actors are good looking and didn't playing their part seriously, but at least they play decently. Surprisingly,  Anne Heche play in a more cameo-role-like, but she deviously fit her minor role. Bridgette Wilson, the future wife of Pete Sampras, also appears in a minor role, but her performance is nice and well done.With the plot that reminiscent of `Prom Night', one of Kevin Williamson favorite, Jim Gillespie managed to direct IKWYDLS in a hip and stylish way and raise the standard for slasher movie. Now, came a long with Scream and Urban Legend, IKWYDLS is the platform maker for the revival of the slasher genre or best known as the 90's slasher. Actually, I never have a chance to read Louis Duncan original novel, but after watched `Killing Mr. Griffith', I know the novel wouldn't be so excessive as the movie, but Kevin Williamson does know how to treat the genre his been adore, and IKWYDLS is entertaining as a horror movie could be. There's a sequel as the spin-of, `I Still Know What You Did Last Summer', but not as good as a the predecessor, and so the Summer-series is end there :-(8/10",I Know What You Did Last Summer

142,lopcar1993,A very well made teen horror film.,2,4 February 2009,"A Clique film? yes, done a million times? definitely. But that's why we go too the movies, we go to seen cheesy plots and stories & gorgeous women. But this movie side steps a few of those problems that almost all movies have. I know what you did last summer has a very intricate and well thought out story and plot, but to a very avid thinker this movie's plot will feel like it was shot full of holes, this films story is derived from the book of the same name. As we all know the movie is never like the book, but this film comes pretty close. Also allot of people and critics look at four main details about a movie. plot, acting, direction and story. These four details make up a film and this movie has three of these four details and that's good enough for me. I know what you did last summer stars Ryan Phillips, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddy Prinze Jr. & Sarah Michelle Gellar as four teenagers who while celebrating the fourth of July go for a drive and accidentally hit a man with there car the four panic and dump his body in the ocean and swear never to talk about it again. Four years pass and the incident has took it's toll on Julie( Jennifer Love Hewitt) she has become reclusive and quiet ever since, the others have gone on with there lives. But what they did four years ago has come back to haunt them, a man with a hook has come back for revenge and it's possible that he's the man they hit four years ago, now with time running out they have to figure out if it's him or somebody else come to avenge his death. I know what you did last summer is a roller coaster ride of thrills and chills that won't let up till the very end. I highly recommended this movie.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
143,stebird,Slasher movie no. 2987. Don't we just love them?,5,18 November 2017,"The nineties brought new life to the slasher sub-genre, how many of these films were made around this time, they were about ten a penny and none of them carried any weighty emphasis, you could be forgiven for mistaking one for another. Four teenagers, a reason, and a murdering fisherman (really a fisherman of all things?) I guess so considering the film's location is a fishing village. The plot is painfully simple and follows the same format as any slasher film, need I have to recite this?Typical teenage fare when it came to the acting, not what you'd call particularly great..., everyone's favourite eye candy from the nineties was there, Sarah Michelle Gellar, as was Leonard from The Big Bang Theory, playing the weedy Max (Johnny Galecki).Indeed there are a number of jump scares but other than that the film wasn't the slightest bit scary, a better way to describe it would be ""lame"". If you like slasher movies I suppose there's something in it for you, but if you're not a fan of them, you might struggle to sit through this film, it may just annoy you instead.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
144,kellyadmirer,Hateful Teens Get What's Coming To Them,4,28 April 2005,"I like to say something positive about every film I review, so I will get that out of the way by saying that Jennifer Love Hewitt never looked better than she does here. The movie poster made her career, along with the scene of her standing in the street and yelling after finding crabs in her trunk (now if that isn't subliminal somehow...). The movie picks up when she starts walking around in that little low-cut blue top. If there is any reason to watch the film now, it is to watch her fleeting moment of glory before she started putting on weight. She looks mighty fine.Overall, this film is ruined by terrible acting and busy direction. We don't get just a scene of the actors walking along - no, we first have to see a random fisherman carrying a humongous fish, I guess to establish that, yes, those fishing boats in the background do indeed mean that this is a fishing village. Sloppiness abounds. As for the acting, don't get me started. Sarah Michelle Gellar reads her lines like a prim schoolgirl reading cue cards with her perfect little pronunciations that sound like she is trying desperately for that ""A"" in elocution. Ryan Phillipe plays his character as if he wants us to throw darts at the movie screen. JLH is mousy one minute and hyperactive the next, and Freddie Prinze Jr. shows he is the master at looking blank while everybody else is over-acting. Everyone seems to be self-conscious in the extreme, straining to create that little extra touch of suspense from random scenes that contain no suspense at all.As for the script, I credit Kevin Williamson with creating characters so unlikeable that we begin rooting for the Gorton Fish Guy to finish them off quickly. They hit some poor schnook in the road, and only get upset at what might happen to THEM. By the way, they know the guy they hit wasn't dead because he moaned and opened his eyes - hello? Are we supposed to feel sympathy for people who don't lift a finger to help an innocent victim they hit and who, as events overwhelmingly establish, was not fatally hurt? This scene in particular was parodied nicely in ""Scary Movie,"" but the whole film is ripe for that treatment.So much makes no sense. Ryan Phillipe goes around punching people at random, really personifying the Ugly Teen paradigm that is the heart and soul of this film, yet the remorseless killer charitably spares his life early in the film - why? Sarah Michelle Gellar, lose the Marlon Brando biker hat! The Jennifer Love Hewitt character, Little Miss Know-It-All (they have a much better name for her in ""Scary Movie), draws instant conclusions from nothing (""This is his weekend, if he's going to do it, he will do it now"" - huh?). The first teen killed, I don't get that, he had nothing to do with the incident at all and in fact kind of sees through the ugly teens' act, why would the killer target him at all, much less first? So much makes no sense. Meanwhile, the teens walk around in their own little self-absorbed dreamworld while everyone else is oblivious to everything. Um, the world at large really isn't that clueless, you know....It's difficult to like a film when you can't like the characters. Ugly teens - don't get me wrong, they are pretty boys and girls, just ugly in the sense of being utterly unlikeable, self-absorbed and arrogant - are a really shaky foundation on which to build a film. Williamson should have gone all the way and made it clearer they had it coming by giving some insight into the slasher's character and motives. As it is, we are driven to try to empathize with characters we also are driven to despise. That internal contradiction ruins the film, well, unless you really do start rooting for the killer....A wildly over-rated film that may please fans of the actors, but probably not too many others. May also be good if you want to see arrogant little High School Gods and Goddesses get their comeuppance.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

146,jiangliqings,Botched attempt at horror.,1,16 June 2001,"* 1/2 out of ****I Know What You Did Last Summer features a good premise.  Four graduating students are out driving one night when they hit a man on the road and believe they have killed him.  Barry Cox (Ryan Phillipe) suggests they dump the body, and his girlfriend Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) agrees with him, while Ray (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and his own girlfriend Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are more hesitant.  Eventually, they do get rid of the body by throwing the dead man into the sea.A year later, Julie is still haunted by the events of that night.  Nothing has gone right for her since then.  Her grades in college are low, her relationship with Ray is over, and she no longer speaks with Barry or Helen. Then she receives a message through the mail that simply says, ""I know what you did last summer.""  Shocked, she reunites with her friends as they try to figure out who is sending them the message.  Barry begins to wonder whether or not someone saw them that night and believes the message is just a stupid, tasteless joke. But things begin to ge more serious as Julie investigates further into what happened the night they hit that man.  Meanwhile, a  mysterious figure dressed in a fisherman outfit is stalking each one of them, playing initially harmless games that begin to lead to murder.The possiblity of having your guilt come back to haunt you is an interesting idea for a horror film, but unfortunately, all this movie has is a good premise.  This could have been a serious exploration into guilt-ridden teenagers, since it is actually quite fascinating to see how their lives disintegrate after that one night, and it's equally interesting to see how they interact with each other again, living with all that guilt in their minds.Instead, director Jim Gillespie and writer Kevin Williamson aim for some slasher horror.  Now, I'm not giving this film a low rating on the basis of the fact that the filmmakers chose to take a different route.  That would be unfair.  The low rating comes mostly from their botched attempts at creating scares and suspense.  Trust me, only someone unfamiliar with the genre would find this movie truly scary.First, let me discuss the writing, since Williamson is considered such hot property.  I'm not really sure why he's so highly regarded.  Sure, he wrote Scream, but nobody seems to realize that that film was hardly the first horror-style parody, as it had been done before and better as early as 1985 in The Return of the Living Dead.  To be fair, this movie isn't tongue-in-cheek like Scream; it's trying to be serious, and yet that also leads to its downfall.  Williamson's script is so hackneyed, it relies on the worst horror cliches to maintain interest.  He even goes with the typical ""there's going to be a sequel"" ending, which was never a very clever idea in the first place. Williamson's dialogue isn't very compelling or easy to listen to when there aren't any references to past horror films, and logic is sacrificed in favor of cheap thrills.Director Gillespie tries his best with the material, but he just doesn't have a lot to work with.  To his credit, he does manage to create some suspense.  The initial mystery of the message is enthralling and the long chase sequence between the killer and Sarah Michelle Gellar is appropriately nail-biting.  But at the same time, Gillespie also crafts many embarassingly bad scenes, such as a parade that features the protagonists looking back and forth at all the fishermen, which are obviously intended to create false scares.  The finale is another flat sequence; there's absolutely no suspense in these scenes, no momentum, and no high-energy going for it, as the sequence is far too overwrought to be effective.As much as the movie is a slasher, it also tries to work as a mystery/thriller by keeping the identity of the killer a secret until the end.  The movie tries to twist back and forth, but every time it does so, the film gets more and more ludicrous until it reaches the climax and final revealing twist, which is bound to provoke more laughs than chills.It's strange to see how tame this movie is, which actually works against it. Slasher flicks of the 80's went all-out when it came to gore and sex/nudity.  I Know What You Did has hardly any blood and zero nudity (though the filmmakers do reveal as much cleavage as possible from Gellar and Hewitt).  The only thing giving this an R-rating is the persistent use of the F-word.  Because it's less self-knowingly schlocky, the movie is less entertaining than its counterparts and predecessors (though not necessarily worse).The performances are crucial in absorbing us into the story.  But Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze, Jr. just don't have the talent to create fully-fleshed and believable characters.  Hewitt is obviously on board for her cleavage while Prinze, Jr. proves to everyone he's going to be the next Keanu Reeves.  Delivering better performances are Ryan Phillipe and Sarah Michelle Gellar, though the script doesn't give them much to work with.  The film focuses on the rekindling boyfriend/girlfriend relationships, thought chooses the wrong one as its primary showcase (a la Hewitt and Prinze, Jr.).The supporting cast doesn't much other than give the characters information, act like suspects, or be downright bitchy and hostile.  Anne Heche plays a rather odd and perhaps slightly insane woman; this is far from being her best role, and she probably leaves this film off her resume these days. Brigette Wilson basically plays the mean sister, though you have to wonder what purpose she serves at all (other than just as fodder). 
I'll admit it, I've never been a fan of teen-oriented horror films (most recent one I can think of that I had an appreciation for is Final Destination).  I Know What You Did Last Summer is the perfect reason why. It's dumb, unimaginative, routine, uninspired, and goes for the easy shocks. There's simply not a lot to admire in this film.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

However Williamson plays it straight as we venture into familiar cliched plot hole territory, which is a shame.The film does benefit from having a great young cast who elevates this from being your average run of the mill slasher to an edge of your seat thriller with engaging performances that makes you care about each character, unlike previous slasher fare where all that mattered was the body count.I have a soft spot for this movie and on the whole it works well enough but I think at the time more was expected of Williamson who became a hot ticket in Hollywood. Had this been more his own work than an adaptation of a novel then maybe he would have made more of it however the movie did help revive the teen slasher for the 90's on the back of Scream and made horror films cool again.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
150,Xophianic,Watch SCREAM instead,6,6 February 2000,"I saw SCREAM and SCREAM 2 before I saw I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. I think that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a rip-off of SCREAM, but a rip-off that can be enjoyed. Plots are similar, but not identical. It also has the similar pretty-teenager-being-stabbed-to-death feel to it.On graduation night, four friends Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) go joyriding while drunk and accidentally run over and supposedly kill somebody in the street. While dumping the body in a bay, the body attacks Barry, then falls into the water. The four assume that he is dead, but the next summer they get notes saying ""I know what you did last summer"". The next thing you know, friends of the four are being murdered left and right and these four become the killer's next targets.The plot is fair, but not especially interesting. I found the SCREAM plot to be much better. The acting and character development in SCREAM are better too. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar both do excellent jobs. Freddie Prinze Jr. is the worst actor I've ever seen in my life, and Ryan Phillippe does a fair job. Ann Heche is very good in the part that she has.The characters, aside from Hewitt, Gellar and Heche, are very thin and rather boring. The killer himself is pretty interesting and fairly cool. The ending of this movie bites. It's maybe worth a rent, but if you want to see a movie of this style I'd recommend URBAN LEGENDS or SCREAM.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
151,flickjunkie-3,Fun and Entertaining.,7,28 December 2000,"*Warning: Spoilers*I had been waning to see I Know What You Did Last Summer for a long time after I saw the trailer. When I saw it, I was slightly disappointed, but I don't mind admitting I had alot of fun watching this.Having continued the end-of-school celebrations with some shenanigans on the beach, four chums - Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry (Ryan Phillipe) and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) - are driving home along the darkened clifftop road when the BMW crumple zone is severely tested by an unidentified object. Further inspection produces a bloodied welly. And then the prostrate figure from whence it came. As tempers, adrenaline and fear run high, the decision is taken to ditch the body. A year on and wracked with guilt, Julie wants nothing to do with her former mates until a spooky note bearing only the titular words turns up. Then things start turning sinister. Barry is mowed down by his own car, Helen has her hair chopped on the eve of her beauty queen parade, and something altogether more unpleasant winds up in Julie's boot.There are lots of decent shocks and scary parts, and Jim Gillespie's direction is pretty clean-cut. Kevin Williamson once again proves he can come up with a winner, and it would be hard to do that after lots of slasher ideas where used in Scream. The performances are decent, TV gals Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar are the stand-out's and the supporting boys aren't bad. But, there are flaws. The killer, Ben Willis, wasn't introduced at all before the ending, although his motive is decent, he is overall a disappointing Hooky.Fun entertainment with an unpredictable story and clever twists.I rate I Know What You Did Last Summer 7 out of 10.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
152,MadReviewer,"Dull, Unimaginative, and a Complete Waste of Time",4,13 May 2001,"One word can be used to describe `I Know What You Did Last Summer' -- ick. It' difficult to believe that Kevin Williamson had the gall to follow up the sly, smart `Scream' with this rancid garbage.  `I Know What You Did Last Summer' is a prime example of bad filmmaking from start to finish. Essentially, it's a big budget version of `Friday the 13th, Part 5', except even the films in the `Friday the 13th' films had better acting and better scripts.  Whatever marketing executives touted this awful film as a `follow-up to Scream' should be flogged for their lies. 
`I Know What You Did Last Summer' is the allegedly horrifying tale of four stereotypical high school friends:  Barry (Ryan Phillippe), the rich jock; Helen (Sarah Michelle Geller), the popular cheerleader; Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), the brain; and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), the loner.  On one fateful Fourth of July, they accidentally hit a stranger on the road, killing him. Instead of reporting the accident like normal, responsible people, they dump the stranger's body in the ocean and vow never to speak of the night again. A year later, when all four characters are still wracked with guilt over the horrible thing they've done, Julie suddenly receives a strange note -- yes, it's the ominous `I Know What You Did Last Summer'.  People around Julie start dropping like flies, dying at the hands of a murderer who dresses suspiciously like the Gorton's Fisherman.  Gratuitous blood and carnage ensues.If the film had any sensibility -- in other words, if it had even vaguely been like `Scream' -- it might've been fun, if not great.  However, the only similarity between the two films is its use of teen TV stars from Fox and the WB.  `Scream' was able to play with the typical slasher film conventions in new and original ways; `I Know What You Did Last Summer' clutches at those conventions like they're religious dogma.  There's no suspense or terror in the film.  Characters wander alone into dark alleys and they die. Characters mouth dumb dialogue ripped straight out of `Nightmare on Elm Street, Part Two' and `Halloween 4'.  Lights go out at the most inconvenient times.  Yawn.  It's been done before, and done much better, by nearly a dozen other slasher films.  I give two of the actors credit for trying -- Ryan Phillippe makes the most of his paper-thin character Barry, and Sarah Michelle Gellar's actually pretty good as the disillusioned Helen -- but their performances aren't nearly enough to save the film.  The other two simply aren't very good.  As Julie, Jennifer Love Hewitt doesn't do much except to ask stupid questions and to look helpless; and Freddie Prinze Jr. is about as lively as a store mannequin as Ray, the troubled loner.  (Side note:  who keeps casting Freddie Prinze Jr. in movies, anyway?  It's scary how consistently the guy keeps churning out flat, wooden performances.)  So, the performance of the four leads essentially even out to add nothing to the film's script . . . and since the script is an unoriginal mess, there's almost nothing good to say about the movie.  (The one original and genuinely funny line spoken in the entire movie is said by Sarah Michelle Gellar -- she makes a reference to `Silence of the Lambs' that's terrific, and also completely out of place with the rest of the insipid nonsense being spoken throughout the film.)Looking for a great, traditional slasher film?  Rent the original `Halloween'.  Looking for a great, modern slasher film? Rent the original `Scream'.  Looking for a rotten, boring, completely uninspired slasher film? Rent `I Know What You Did Last Summer'.  Avoid this film like the plague. Grade: D",I Know What You Did Last Summer

Then it cuts to four teenagers, Julie, Helen, Barry, and Ray (Hewitt, Gellar, Phillipe, and Prinze), having a good time on the beach drinking. Julie and Ray are dating as is Helen and Barry and when they decide to go home Barry drank too much so Ray must drive. There driving like normal teenagers in horror movies do, which is not paying attention, and ooh no they hit a man. They believe the man is dead, but wait the director tries to get two to three scares out of this, he is not. The four decide it is best for them to drop the body in the water near them because they knew they would suffer from consequences because it would look like drunk driving. The guy is not dead yet though. They finally go through some stuff which is stupid and leave him in the water. Then they swear to never speak of this again. End of movie. No I'm just kidding, that would be too good. One year later when Julie comes home from school she gets a note saying that someone knew what she did last summer...ooh scary.The screenplay for this film was absolutely terrible. It was so formulaic it was disgusting. The whole film was predictable, every second of it. The scares were cheap they were just surprises and the actual parts that are supposed to be scary are boring. Now people will probably say to me well it is just a teen slasher film, what did you expect? Excuse me for expecting something with a little originality. Kevin Williamson, you wrote Scream which was a pretty enjoyable film and your follow up is this piece of garbage? Terrible, truly terrible.The direction for this film, like the writing, was completely formulaic as well. I felt like I saw this film before and clearly Gillespie does not know how to get out a decent performance from an actor. A lot of times in horror films there are some really cool shots, but not in this one. Along with the writing, extremely poor direction.Acting, ha. There was no acting in this film. It was just people putting on scared faces reading lines. The whole cast was absolutely terrible. I'm not going to get into detail about their performances because clearly they didn't.Even the score for this film was formulaic. It was just used for the cheap scares that it could get out of the film and that was it. It was suspenseful yet it seemed like I heard it in every other bad horror film. The only thing in the film though that could possibly get a scare.Overall I give this film a 2/10, due to the fact that it is awful in every aspect. One of the worst films I've seen in a while, I only watched it because it was expiring on netflix instant queue and I thought it would be decent. If I had to recommend this film I would recommend it to people who like really bad horror films.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
156,weberpr,I Know What You Did Last Summer,5,19 June 2005,"I Know What You Did Last Summer is a horror film about a great of friends who hit a stranger in there car and decide to bury the body, but they are not so shore if it's still buried. A great young cast starring (Jennifer Love Hewitt), (Sarah Michelle Gellar), (Ryan Phillipe) and (Freddie Prince Jr) I Know What You Did Last Summer is definitely in the wake of Scream and other earlier horror flicks but the storyline is original, the acting was strong from Hewitt but not so much from the rest of the cast, A Predictable horror flick but I just like the adrenalin rush of a film like this for what it was light entertainment I can say I enjoyed it.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
157,jerralagbayani,"A Movie Only Known as ""The Scream-Copy cat,"" But they are wrong",6,28 February 2018,"What triggers me is that this film was pretty okay compared to the hate Wes Craven lovers give it. It never copied it and was probably only inspired by it. Has it ever came to anyone that in Scream there is no man with a hook gutting people, no throwing a man that you ran over into the sea, and no cast of characters watching out for a killer, without cops involved, around the beginning of July? Nope. I am very deeply annoyed. 
Now lets get with the rating part. I give this a 6/10 because it is a slasher film that really pushes your buttons into not knowing what's gonna happen next. It was quite bland towards the middle but other than that it was a Slash of a Good Time. What I especially like is how it messes with your mind every now and then, especially towards the end. Will be happy to rate the other two after I'm done with my list i need to watch.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
158,MissCzarChasm,Pretty Good Mystery Thriller,7,9 April 2000,"I Know What You Did Last Summer is by no means a perfect horror film. In fact Kevin Williamson did a much better job writing Scream. But this film isn't that bad at all. I think this film works not as a horror film, but a good mystery thriller with a little slashings in between. The mystery kept me involved with tihs film, not the horror.The film is about 4 friends who are having one last night of fun during the summer before they go off into the real world and experience life. Fun turns deadly when they accidentally run over someone in the middle of the road. Out of fear of getting in trouble they decide to dumb the body. One year later they receive a fateful message. ""I Know what you did last summer"" Pretty soon they are being stalked by a violent killer. could it be the person they hit? or did someone see what they did?This is why this film worked for me. trying to figure out who was after them and why? it was fun trying to solve the mystery. The scares and slasher scenes were there as an added bonus.The acting was pretty good. Jennifer Love Hewitt is good at playing the helpless victim. Plus the girl can scream. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a little better than jennifer. she has more range and she has the privlege of being in one of the best scenes in the movie. Ryan Phillippe is good at playing the jerk/jock type. i thought he was good in the film, but Freddie Prinze Jr. was really bad in the film. he put absolutley no emotion in his lines.So when you see this film don't expect a Scream type film. lok at it for what it is a good mystery which i enjoyed. so sit back and try and solve it.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
159,MissCzarChasm,Average Slasher Film,7,24 November 2001,"I Know What you Did Last Summer is described in one word: Average. Kevin Williamson's follow-up to the far more clever Scream settles for typical teen slasher fare instead of being hip and inventive. However, if he was purposely trying to make something along the lines of Prom Night or Friday the 13th he succeeds. This film really reminded me of the cheesy yet entertaining horror films of the 80's.The films premise is pretty basic. 4 teens with everything going for them accidentally run down someone on the road and decide to dump the body. One year later a mysterious figure dressed as a fisherman begins to stalk the teens. Is it the person they hit? Is it someone who knows them? you have to watch to find out.What I Liked:i liked the location they used for this film. It's a pretty scary atmosphere and it's a briliant set-up for what goes on in the film.I loved the costume they used for the killer. I was frightened by it during several moments of the film. The Hook is also a good touch as well.I enjoyed Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe in the film. i found them to be the most at ease with their characters. Not to mention Sarah's chase scene in  the film is thrilling. By far the best moment of the film. It reminded me a lot of the chase scene in Halloween when the shape is stalking laurie.What i didn't Like:The script was pretty generic and considering this was the same guy that wrote Scream i was expecting a lot more.The fact that during a clearly hot day in july everyone is wearing a slicker. They used this to build suspense but i found it rather stupid.Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. annoyed the hell out of me. Jennifer gives an absolutely contrived performance. I believe i've seen her play the innocent role way too many times and it's getting a little tired. Freddie Prinze Jr is just awful. He was truly the weakest link in the cast. However, i will give him credit by saying that he did improve in future roles.The confrontation on the boat is a bit of a let-down. especially since it followed a far surperior cat and mouse chase between gellar and the fisherman.The Shock ending was such a lame way to end it. The more i see it the more i realize how dumb it is. The fact that they did the same thing in the sequel makes it even worse.I know it seems like i'm totally bashing the film i was entertained for it's 90 minute running time. I only recommend it for true horror/slasher movie buffs. Especially for gellars chase scene.6/10",I Know What You Did Last Summer
160,stiva,"You are about to be hooked, beware...",7,11 July 2007,"This movie is not that scary, but has it's moments here and there. Still it's worth watching for fun. The plot is good and the actors have done their jobs well. A good teen-slasher movie of 90's. It's a classic one.It would have been much better if the murders were made much darker and much gorier. Though, there is one good scene. Sara Michelle chase scene is very intense. The slasher was not scary enough. This movie would qualify for PG-18 certificate but, surely not for R rated movie. Watch this movie. You won't regret it. It's an entertaining movie.For Story, I give it a 3... For Actors, I give it a 2... And, for scary part, I give it a 2...

161,HORROR_FAN_1,A very watchable Film,8,18 April 2002,"I watched 'I know what you did last Summer' a few years ago and then just recently and I was quite impressed. The storyline and script is quick and exciting and I think the whole general cast does well. Just simply a good movie with the usual twists in it that every modern day horror flick seems to possess. My favourite character has to be 'Barrie Cox' who is played by Ryan Phillippe, he is just comical and doesn't stand for any crap of anyone. I wouldn't class this film as being especially scary but it is enjoyable nonetheless. Obviously there is also the added bonus of Jennifer Love Hewitt who is a total babe.Rating 8/10. Enjoyable.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
162,merrywater,Apparently too underrated,7,12 April 2015,"OK, this isn't a masterpiece of the kind, however, it has atmosphere, something that is just as important as a good plot. Having stated that, everyone knows that I mean to say that the plot is bad. It is. The main offender is simply totally unbelievable: a middle-aged fisherman of an exceptionally good physique that accounts for his übermenschlich capability to survive (1) being run over by a fast moving BMW (2) being drowned (3) being dismembered and spectacularly thrown of a ship Hell ya, this guy's a cat man with his nine lives ready at stake when two couples of airhead teenagers meet up with him. He's simply Jason, Michael Myers and the Boogeyman all in one.Anyway, IKWDLS is well-crafted, has decent portraying of the two of the female protagonists and their family, a reasonably thorough depiction of a fishing hamlet, good music, a solid base in the 90s adolescent subculture, and atmosphere.The opening sequence is a beautiful sweeping footage of a seashore in the sunset followed by a number of suspenseful scenes that adds to the atmosphere that I'm talking about. The entry of the killer kind of destroys it, knowing that he will arise from that dead (and the bottom of the sea) quite soon.The title unfortunately refers to the unbelievable nicely hand written short messages that the killer (after all he's gone through) miraculously succeeds to distribute to the protagonists. I especially dislike the part of 'Missy' (a misplaced cajun type of a woman that lives in the woodlands, a kind of in-breed that appears only in order to prolong the picture) standing in her backyard chopping chicken, and then reveals her brother's alleged suicide note (written by the killer previously to the pertinent plot) from a shed just behind her! Now, why would anyone be expected to accept that someone living in a freakingly huge house would keep such a sensitive document in such a place???Another disturbingly stupid sequence is when Jennifer Love Hewitt's character discovers a body together with some crabs in the trunk of her car, runs to fetch her friends, and when they all return the trunk is as neat as ever, despite the mess that was in it just a moment ago. Simply, an unnecessary scene that doesn't add to the story a bit.In spite of the partly severe arguments against this picture, I still like it enough to watch it from time to time, and get nostalgic about the carefree (?) 90s...",I Know What You Did Last Summer
163,mbworm,Same Old Slasher,6,19 March 2008,"There's an undeniably strong style to this sleeper 90's slasher flick, but it fails miserably to truly scare the audience in the wake of Scream. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar were the temporary scream queens under the hand of Jim Gillespie and ""Scream"" writer Kevin Williamson. Despite his ingeniously dark, witty and scary script for Scream that launched him to horror movie fame, Williamson's script here is simple and clichéd, with predictable scares and dialogue that do nothing to honor Lois Duncan's tense teen fiction novel. Barely following the plot of the book save for the title, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" follows a group of teenagers who accidentally kill a man and try to cover up their secret... but of course, ""Some Secrets Refuse to Stay Buried"" and a year later a masked man in a fisherman's slicker and bearing a hook is terrorizing the teenagers in their ""Dawson's Creek""-like Southern town during their summer break. Nothing is surprising, the sequence of deaths is fairly easy to predict, and there's barely any suspense besides a truly engaging chase scene between Sarah Michelle Gellar and the killer. Jennifer Love Hewitt and her glossed over costars are adequate as the victims in despair, but there is barely any depth or fear conveyed in the story. It's a shameless cash in on Scream that just fails to hit the mark, especially the corny and totally unbelievable ending. If you're into gore and mediocre teen slasher movies this film has your name all over it, but if you're looking for something intense you might as well read the book or watch Scream instead.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
164,Pythe,Better than I remember it,6,15 November 2002,"I Know What You Did Last Summer was recently on TV the other day, and on a whim I watched it. The movie has a lot more going for it than I remember, although it's still not really much to write home about. The best aspect is that, contrary to most of the work in the slasher subgenre, this film actually tries to make you care about the characters, rather than making them two-dimensional sex fiends/death fodder. Especially well-handled is Julie's descent into paranoia and introversion. Another pro is the mystery aspect, which manifests as a slow revelation of what really happened on the traumatic night of the summer referred to in the title.Unfortunately, that's about it for the pros. The dialogue, which tries to be hip, is instead rather banal. Characters suddenly become extraordinarily stupid when chased by the killer. Dead bodies (one covered in dozens of live crabs) appear and disappear in crowded suburbs in broad daylight, when, presumably, somebody might notice a humongous man breaking into car trunks and depositing corpses. Apart from being implausible, most of the scary moments are also rather predictable, as they've appeared in enough horror movies before to be, at this point, beyond cliché.Oh, and this doesn't matter one way or the other, but the movie has only the slightest resemblance to the book on which it is based.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
165,Horror_Fan01,"Fun, Entertaining And Scary!",8,25 February 2007,"This has to be one of my favorite horror movies, it's very unique, scary, entertaining, and most of all, original. The cast is very hot, and act very well in this film. It packs a lot of thrills and chills! I was never bored by this story, since it unfolded as it went, and allowed the viewer to continually keep guessing on the perpetrator's identity. That puzzle was fun, as was the costume in which the murderer exterminated his victims (fisherman's outfit, complete with hook...always seemed kind of eerie to me).The down side was that much like in SCREAM, the murderer did just seem to be around when the main cast was present, and always seemed to disappear (a bit too conveniently at times) when anyone else appeared. That aside, the movie intensified as it went on, charged through a quick 90 minutes, and left enough room for one and all to look forward to another hip, young sequel in the future, tentatively entitled I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.

Absolutely terrible acting.
It was truly awful but my 4 score was based on the scenes without this hook carrying killer in there.
The run over and dumping into the sea scenes and the girls living in fear.
All the kills are so lazily written with hardly any creativity and they're rushed through as the camera diverts away leaving it to your own imagination. Just lazy.
And to top it all off, one of those ridiculously messy final act scenes.
It's worth a watch but it's unbelievable what goes on in the heads of these writers and producers.
Freddy in the 80s was fantastic.
Final Destination in the 2000s was perfection.
Both of which had a unique creation and storytelling and amazing production.

167,Extraordinary_Machine,"A decent teen slasher film, but one can't help feeling that Kevin Williamson missed a big chance to send up traditional horror archetypes once more...",7,21 April 2005,"I Know What You Did Last Summer It's the Fourth of July, and Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt, TV's ""Party of Five""), Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), and Barry (Ryan Phillippe) are intent on celebrating their graduation from high school, which, for them, means driving to a secluded beach, getting drunk, telling ghost stories and making out with each other. But later that evening, on the way back to town, they accidentally hit a man with their car, apparently killing him. After thinking things through, the group reluctantly decides to dump the body in the sea, and swear to take the secret of what they did that night to their graves. One year later, a still guilt-ridden Julie returns from college to her hometown, and finds an incriminating message in the mail: somebody knows what they did last summer. After rounding up her circle of former friends, she tries to figure out who alive could have seen them leave a man for dead. But the events surrounding the accident may be more complicated than any of them had originally thought.Last year, screenwriter Kevin Williamson came out of nowhere with 'Scream, a self-referential satire on the teen slasher oeuvre wrapped warmly in classic Wes Craven thrills. Unexpectedly, but deservedly, a surprise runaway box office success followed. Based on the reception of his feature debut, and before Craven and the folks at Dimension came knocking for a 'Scream' sequel (due out this winter), Williamson took it upon himself to bring author Lois Duncan's novel 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' to the big screen. The end product is a decent teen slasher film, but one can't help feeling that Williamson missed a big chance to send up traditional horror archetypes once more.As the world of 'Last Summer' wasn't originally Williamson's own creation, it's to be expected that the film not be strung through with the same knowing streak of humour that was the driving force behind 'Scream'. Or maybe it's just that Williamson had grown tired of the same old jokes, and opted to shun them out of 'Last Summer' altogether. But through opting to stay within the lines for his latest film, Williamson has gutted what made his first so special. Sadly, 'Last Summer' does not stand apart from the crowd of horror films that Kevin Williamson so skilfully mocked ten months ago. That said, this is perhaps the first slasher film to come out since 'Scream', and, against the odds, this serves to the film's advantage, as it's almost quite enjoyable watching the clichés play out in front of you exactly as predicted.Ironically, British director Jim Gillespie ('Joyride'), in his first Hollywood production, has made a good effort to mimic the works of Wes Craven, specifically with the commanding score by John Debney. Marco Beltrami's work on 'Scream' is the template used by Debney here, and the versatile composer manages to accentuate the tension well, despite signalling some of the scares. However, Gillespie makes the mistake of depicting the death scenes too graphically. Gore could have been used well in 'Last Summer', but Gillespie leaves the camera rolling for too long during the vicious attacks on the killer's victims, which end up more repulsive than anything. Gillespie ain't no Craven, that's for sure.The cast (or should I say group of attractive teens that are waiting to be offed?) also seem to be taking this project a little too unsmilingly, with actors Freddie Prinze Jr. and Ryan Phillippe more concerned with trying to see which one of them can ham it up the most than actually developing characters worth caring about. Jennifer Love Hewitt is decent enough here, but her performance never fully convinces. It's up to Sarah Michelle Gellar to strap ably into ""damsel in distress"" mode (something that the actress should know about, starring on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" week after week), and does more than necessary to make the audience truly feel for Helen Shivers as she laments her shattered dreams. Jamie Lee Curtis, you might want to keep an eye on your Scream Queen coronet.The final act of the film is hard to resist, as it stages a series of nice set pieces that keep you close to the edge of your seat at all times, right up to the agreeably trite, sequel-friendly ending. But Williamson needs to learn how to wean the parody away from his screenplays without completely robbing them of any innovativeness. I admire the man for not repeating himself, but he seems to have progressed right into a career corner with 'Last Summer'. 'Scream 2' will most likely return him to the top of the pyramid once again, but I'd rather not think about what might happen after that.~ 7/10 ~",I Know What You Did Last Summer
168,timefreezer7,Decent shlasher film,8,2 March 2002,"Of course , this film is inferior than Scream but it does have its merits . I had heard so much trash about this thriller that I was very wary when I heard that TV would air it . Nevertheless I decided to give it a chance , expecting to see an easily forgettable campy teen horror film in the worst case . I was wrong : just like the case with ""Last Action Hero"" or ""The Saint"" (1997) people find it convenient to reject them in order to follow the dictates of the official critics but when it comes to awful films like ""Mission Impossible"" (1996) or ""True Lies"" which are critically acclaimed (obviously to promote them) everybody rushes to join the cult masses in order not to disclose the fact that he cannot see the emperor 's new clothes. I am not saying that Last Action Hero or the Saint are without defects but are very overlooked and underrated . I Know What you Did Last Summer is a very flawed movie but fortunately Williamson 's pen has done it again : he gives us some genuine chills .         First the minuses : this flick has the worst performances I have ever seen in years . The actors give the impression that got tired of studying the script and the director wrote the script on a blackboard , and the leads read their lines directly during the actual filming . The corny acting is sometimes laughable but hey this actually turns to be amusing ! There are a couple of scenes copied directly from Halloween . There are plot holes like how could the killer clean up everything just in a few seconds . Speaking of the killer , he could be much scarier and his suit should be redesigned in order to make him more dark and menacing . I suppose they wanted to make him look realistic and not give him a fancy outfit like Freddy , Jason , Father Death in ""Scream"" etc .. The biggest flaw is that the premise (based on a book) could have made a more psychologically orientated agony thriller about guilt and remorse (your crime will eventually return to avenge you ) . The writer preferred to make the film more action - packed perhaps after the libels that Scream was too much self - referential , comedic and with little gore . This movie was also rejected by critics who said that it underused the psychological atmosphere to degenerate to a teeny bopper with gore and blood . Well you cannot have it both ways you know !!!          On the plus side : the 4 leads were carefully chosen for the roles. Fresh young faces to make us like them . They sure did . Despite the plot 's flaws the film has a wonderful threatening atmosphere and manages to be memorable and to escape the aesthetics of a TV-like slasher or a common B-movie . The opening sequence is perhaps the best and will be included within the most classic ones of all thrillers . We first see a young man alone at a cliff late at night drinking . He is sad : it is obvious that something haunts him from the past . Then we see the graduation party of the 4 leads (two couples) . When they take a ride with a car , being semi-drunk they accidentally hit someone with the car . The accident scene and the subsequent sequence with the huge dilemma and the eventual disposal of the body are marvelous . One year later Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) receives a note saying ""I know what you did last summer"" . The demons from the past start tormenting her and the 4 friends are reunited in order to figure out what to do .            Surprisingly there is very little gore . We simply see the hook supposedly gutting the victims and the result is effective . In many points the direction compensates for the script 's faults , like in the climactic chases . Anne Heche gives a decent performance as Missy the slightly retarded , wild beast-like sister of the supposed victim . There are no self - referential lines (obviously not wanting to rip off Scream) except in one point (the Jodie - Angela undercover names). The script 's originality is wonderful in some scenes which invert some of the most eternal trivialities. The most characteristic example is the inversion of Psycho 's shower scene where Barry (Ryan Philippe) is alone in the gym , having a bath while the danger is threateningly near . At last , for once , the individual-in-peril is a guy ! The best scenes in the film are the ones with the flamboyant Sarah Michelle Gellar (Helen) but I cannot give them away . All I can say is that Helen is probably the most developed character and the most natural performance comes from Gellar . As for the scene in the car tires alleyit has been printed indelibly in my mind . 
Freddy Prinze Jr as Ray is nothing more than the dark-haired handsome guy . He serves only as the love interest for Helen and a potential suspect (he is a fisherman and he has a hook) and he spends most of the movie quarreling with Barry .Enough said , I think . The cliffhanger finale is kind of lame but this film was not made to win Academy awards . It is purely campy fun with a few occasional psychedelic hints about crime and punishment (""Do you ever wonder if it was a suicide? ""  "" If that 's the way you are able to sleep at nights .... "" ) . Switch off your brains and have a nice dose of entertainment . Not as good as the astonishing Scream but undoubtly one of the landmarks of 90 's horror films . You simply must not expect much . A solid                                                     8 / 10",I Know What You Did Last Summer

That better is thanks to Kevin Williamson's witty writing and knowing how to put a story together, not leaving holes in the plot and the ability for making surprises, suspense, mystery, thriller. Unfortunately the director was not quite fit for the job, especially in the bloody parts which were pretty ordinary and uninventive for an R rated movie (He later did a good job with Venom which didn't had a scrip at all). If that thing was done as good as the script we would've get much better experience.

Sure there are a lot of cliches and the acting is not Oscar-winning stuff, but the characters, while not particularly deep, are convincing. Particularly powerful is the depiction of the destructive effects of guilt on the characters and their relationships.

Furthermore, many of the scenes are laughable, especially since the film takes itself so seriously.  Besides that, all the characters that die deserve to - they get killed because they go someplace alone knowing that a killer is after them or they backtrack while the killer is pursuing them. The moral ambiguity of the characters doesn't foster a sense of sympathy, either.  Of course, it probably doesn't help that I hate all the actors in the leads (except for Gellar).I hear the sequel is worse.  I can't imagine.  1/10",I Know What You Did Last Summer

The plot is very predictable though, but I expected that. A group of teens run over a fisherman and dump his body in the ocean hoping their secret will never be found out. We then see these teens getting stalked by the killer and soon everyone is getting hacked up. But like I said it did scare the audience and myself at times and at other times the movie dragged on a little and some of the choices the actors do to get themselves out of danger is ridiculous.(like Sarah Michelle Gellar).

173,filmbuff-05706,I Know That This Could Have Been Written Better.,4,30 September 2020,"I just finished seeing this movie and I needed to write about it immediately. I Know What You Did Last Summer was apparently a hit when it came out, but I wonder who made it such? The movie is appealing, but it fails on many levels.The movie follows 4 teens who, after graduation, go on a reckless car ride. They end up hitting a pedestrian and panic. They contemplate reporting it to the police, but they MIGHT be caught with alcohol and reckless driving, making them guilty of manslaughter.So instead, they dump the man into the nearest lake. In doing so, they find out that he is still alive, so they drive away with him underwater and vow to never speak of it again.A whole year passes, and one of the teens receives a note that reads: I Know What You Did Last Summer. Then they get other disturbing notes and pranks(One prank, for instance, involves a girl getting her hair chopped off in her sleep.) Instead of contacting the police, the teens decide they should confront the man themselves, which has bloody results.I usually prefer to analyze the good parts of a movie, before the bad. I did like the cast, and I think they do alright with what they are given. They are characters to care about. Even the female leads are quite attractive.I will also give credit that the movie is mostly engaging. Aside from a slow first 10 minutes, I was never really bored. And as a horror movie, it does have intense moments throughout, especially near the end. However, I would not say that it carries for a horror movie that runs for 100 minutes.My rating is a 4/10. That shows that the flaws outweigh the good, so I clearly have some gripes with the movie! I already mentioned the slow start, but that's just the beginning.Having read my synopsis, some of the flaws should be clear. This movie wouldn't go so far if the teens had called the police. But since they fear punishment for the effect of reckless driving, they decide to literally drown their secret. As such, the plot is dependent on this flaw of not doing the obvious right thing. And if your plot is dependent on a plot hole, then the hole is just digging deeper.There are many moments that wouldn't work in a real life setting. For instance, when the teen girl gets the note with the title's words, her mother receives it through an envelope with no return address, and she casually gives it to her daughter without finding it odd that an envelope has no return address!In one horrifying scene, a teen opens her car trunk and discovers a corpse with crabs crawling all over it. She tries to show it to her friends, but the killer somehow got back into the trunk, removed the body and crabs, removed the stink that would give off, and any traces of such a scene...all without being noticed?In many scenes, the killer chases after them, and they make many mistakes here. In some chases, the kids run closer to the villain and not further. WHY? Why would you do that? In one scene, a police officer goes towards him and is sliced as a result, just seconds after one of the girls warns him. He ignores the screams and continues towards the killer.If I thought long enough, I could make a laundry list of stupid mistakes and clichés that this movie provides. It ends up like most horror movies as a result, and falls flat. In this case, it's flatter than most films in the genre. Even with clichés, I tend to at least like horror movies. This one is an exception.As I watched the movie, I struggled to know what my rating would be. At times, I thought there were good enough moments to recommend it(Anne Heche's performance is well done, probably one of the better ones in fact), but near the end, I knew that I hated this movie.It doesn't help when you consider seeing something different in the first half hour and want it over in the last half hour. I thought of what I rate different movies and I came up with a 4. There are some good elements sprinkled throughout, but the story line was so poor that the good parts don't even really matter when all things are said and done.I also found it appalling to discover that this was the 20th highest grossing movie of the year. Granted, it was a small amount compared to it's #1(That being Titanic), but to know that wonderful movies like The Ice Storm and The Apostle were less successful is quite terrifying, more than the movie- quite frankly!I could rant further, but what I have said is sufficient. I Know What You Did Last Summer is a cliché, underwritten, and flawed movie that is a disgrace to horror films. In a genre where The Exorcist, Halloween, and Scream reign supreme, this falls below royalty. It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I don't say that much.Note: This is an edit of my review written on 7/13/20 and re-edited on 7/28.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

I wanted to see this film with an open mind and thought that since it's the first movie to copy ""Scream"" and not the 100th movie to do so, it might still be fun. I was wrong. While the story and screenplay are okay, the actors and performances are terrible!! Those movies can only work if you care about the characters but I found myself thinking: ""When is he finally gonna hook her (Sarah Michelle Gellar) up?"". Gellar was very annoying and she was really bad in this one. None of the other actors were convincing either.

176,sublime501,"Ridiculous, but one of the best teen slasher movies.",5,25 June 2004,"I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is one of the first of the teen slasher genre, and it's probably one of the best. But that's not to say it's a good movie. It's the story of four teenagers: Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Ray (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), Barry (Ryan Phillippe), and Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar). On the 4th of July one year, they drunkenly hit a man crossing the road and dump his body in the lake so as to hide the evidence. But a year later, someone begins sending Julie threatening notes stating that they ""know what she did last summer."" Whoever is sending these notes begins to stalk the four of them with one thing in mind--vengeance.Considering that the teen slasher genre is a rather simple and shallow one, calling I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER one of the best of the genre doesn't say much. The premise is a lot more clever than those of most of the genre, but it's not carried out very well. The majority of the movie is the four teens trying to solve the mystery of who is doing these things to them, while the actual slashing is only a feature of the movie. That's a good thing, but the actual detective work isn't very interesting in itself. And the slashing... well, let's just say that it's very predictable and timed just right, with only one or two scares/surprises throughout the whole movie. The score lets you know exactly when and where the parts that are supposed to be scary come in. And the script is almost ridiculous.Almost everything is overacted and very melodramatic. Jennifer Love Hewitt is actually a good actress, but her role is very limited and doesn't require much. She seems to get the brunt of the corny lines and moments. Ryan Phillippe is actually pretty good as the arrogant and brash Barry, even though his role is very limited as well. Freddie Prinze, Jr., and Sarah Michelle Gellar deliver pretty wooden performances, though you can't really blame them as they're given very little to work with. Anne Heche does all right in an unnecessary cameo.I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a pretty ridiculous film, but if you're into the genre, you can't get much better. 5/10.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

181,very_doubtful,One of the better 90s slasher films,8,24 March 2000,"After the success of ""Scream"" we had the ""pleasure"" to see a lot of rather cheap imitations but IKWYDLS is probably the only good one among these. Don't get me wrong, it is way worse than ""Scream"" but still entertaining and definitely better than ""Urban Legend"" etc. The script was written by Kevin Williamson who is also the author of the ""Scream""-screenplay. The motive of the killer is not that brilliant (but neither was the one of Billy & Stu). The film gets pretty interesting once the slasher-action starts. The suspense is great and there are several scenes that made me jump.The story is sometimes a little confusing and I didn't find myself rooting for the teens because the actors are rather pale in this movie. However the film delivers some very creative scenes that are truly enjoyable and different from the death scenes in other 90s slasher films.What I didn't understand was why the fisherman also killed some people that weren't even involved in the situation. He's not a deranged killer like Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees who can't distinguish what is good and what is evil. Unlike Michael and Jason he wants to take his revenge on the teens and has a plan of how to do it. It's not because I'm offended by pointless violence but this just doesn't make sense (on the other hand it wasn't supposed to win an Oscar).Beside ""Scream"", this is the only teen-horror flick that is really entertaining and (at least partly) inventive.My rating: 8/10 (Forget about the sequel, it's not worth the money)",I Know What You Did Last Summer

It does not make the film better than either of the Scream films but it is scarier.The film starts off like the first Halloween in that not much happens for the first part of the film and then towards the end Mr Fisherman starts hacking people to bits.One of the two main things that let the film down was the fact that although the Fisherman has a personal grudge against the four main characters why did he feel the need to start hacking people at random. The second thing is the identity of the killer.The acting in this film was really good except for the rampant overacting by the killer at the end who looks like he went to the Robert Englund subtlety school. The two female leads give the best performances and are more attractive than the women that usually appear in the likes of Elm Street or Friday the 13th.I saw this film several times at the cinema and not just because of the cleavage. Every time I saw the film the shower scene at the end still made me jump - even though I was expecting it.

Only four people were killed by the actual killer. Some of the comments on the cover to the movie read, ""Creepier than Scream"" and stuff like that. This movie seems like a joke compared to Scream. You don't even discover the actual plot of the movie until the end and the killer chase victim scenes could not be any more fake. Its no wonder the character's ended up dead.

192,Was-it-All-a-Dream,I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997),5,4 May 2009,"2001's Jeepers Creepers and 1996's Scream are pretty much the reason we still have horror to this day in North America. Cliché and studio sequels pretty much killed the genre back in the early 90's. Especially studios like New Line Cinema which were running horror into the ground with awful films that were destroying the names of great directors like Tobe Hooper (1995's The Mangler) and John Carpenter (1995's In the Mouth of Madness), and 1980's phenomenon franchise Friday the 13th with 1993's Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday. All the smaller, independent studios were being gobbled up by bigger companies. Until we have today's current situation where Artisan was eaten by Lions Gate, Roger Corman's ""New Horizons"" by Disney, etc. Studios are responsible for scanning in on a small trend in the horror genre when it's making money, they rip it off, blow that up, and squeeze every last ounce from it until they figure it's not profitable anymore and move on, doing the same to another genre when they figure there's more to be made from romantic comedies or action flicks or family-friendly stuff.Scream's success gave Kevin Williamson a legitimate career and financed a trilogy. A very good one, all things considered. It also helped to revitalize the horror genre... Although, for better? I say worse. And surprisingly, I say that not because the trend of teen films it gave birth to was all that bad. It wasn't. It's because instead of moving on with fresher ideas, it taught filmmakers to simply copy the basic plot of a current popular film of the same sub-genre, add an alternate novelty twist, then press ahead with a big budget and see if the new Mtv music video directing hot shot would give them Scream type returns. It was a matter of investment. It was all about money and how much it would buy. Nobody fixed the scripts if they weren't interesting. Nobody really wrote deep characters. The actors and actresses would always have to be the characters. Anything that wasn't pure stereotype were the casts just acting like themselves.Scream was not supposed to start a trend. In fact, when it did, Williamson was tasked to write this script. And he didn't try very hard. Instead, he put all his effort and talent into writing a bang-up script for Scream 2, and probably squeaked this one out for a little pocket change. Or the chance to direct it. Which he didn't get, instead he directed 1999's dreadfully boring teen kidnap comedy, Teaching Mrs. Tingle. The horror genre's in much worse shape now. But back then, even though the movies felt the same, they still had more intelligent characters. Or at the very least, more complex ones. Another thing that made me like this trend better than our current one, was that nobody was posing. The writers really knew people like the college kids they were writing and plot twists were better supported and more solid than the action and crime films nowadays that pass for horror. And, though it took awhile, the movies were just a lot smarter than the direct-to-video films. Where again, the directors probably had grander ambitions but weren't wise or experienced enough.I Know What You Did Last Summer's focus is on the failures of the wide-eyed, naive teenagers. How in high school they make big plans and often try to go out and make their dreams come true and fall hard, flat on their face. The film already takes place during a season where there is nothing but overcast skies (which I usually adore). But this plot just makes it a bummer. I guess you could call it refreshing that it breaks a few slasher sub-genre conventions. For example, following the film's trademark ""accident"" (which has been ripped off so many times since, it's not funny), the characters hate each other so much, there's no partying or hanky panky. Which I'm fine with. But maybe if there had been, the movie wouldn't feel so oppressive. This movie has a few good chase scenes and the acting is very professional, but it's absolutely no fun at all. I don't know if that's because of how non-clichéd the activities the characters partake in are or not. The ending (or ""coda"" as they call it) does sort of pep the movie up a bit. And, my simple mind allows me to smile with the ditsy main character, clad in nothing but a white towel, once again.This film does manage to feel a little more grown-up than the sequel. More like a real movie, less like a TV show. Although, as I say this I'm reminded that actors Johnny Galecki came from Roseanne, Sarah Michelle Gellar went on to become Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Jennifer Love Hewitt is the Ghost Whisperer. It's also great to see that underrated powerhouse Anne Heche also make a bit of a cameo. That someone of her stature would do a 6-minute acting job on a film like this proves that Hollywood can smell a talent who hasn't even reached their full potential yet. Scream is Kevin Williamson's best work. But by Hollywood standards, his 1998 television series Dawson's Creek swept more awards ceremonies. Why shouldn't he enjoy that success? Even though it isn't great, it's a guilty pleasure show. Much like this movie. Which sold lots of magazines with ""exclusive"" inside stills of a shirtless Ryan Phillippe who also winds up in no more than a towel in the movie. Too bad they didn't have any skimpy pics of Freddy Prinze Jr.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

202,haudit,What was Sarah Michelle Gellar Thinking?,3,27 October 2001,"I have only seen this movie a few times, once upon it's original release here in the UK, and again last night, as I bought it on video (I got it in a sale for £4.99).  All I have to say is - is that it?  Nothing even remotely interesting happens for the entire 97 minute duration of this film.  The deaths seem routine and aren't even remotely gory.  How come we didn't actually see Sarah Michelle Gellar or Ryan Phillipe getting gutted (now him getting gutted I would pay good money to see), when we saw SMG being sliced and diced in Scream 2?Another problem I have with this film is that SMG now suffers from Shatner Syndrome.  She's now so famous for being Buffy, I just couldn't take her seriously as a victim.  What was she thinking appearing in this mindless drivel.  Most people seem to think she filmed this crap before she got the role of Buffy, but it was actually made during her hiatus between Buffy season's 1 and 2 (check the hair out and you'll see I'm right).  If I had been a casting director for Buffy and seen her in this, I would never, ever have given her the role.But, back to the film itself, as I said, nothing even remotely interesting happens for the whole film, and besides Gellar, the acting uniformly sucks!!!  Whoever told Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prize Jr they could act were obviously delusional.  If I ever have to sit through another 'ooooh!! I'm a serious actor' performance from Prinze, I think I might spew. God help the forthcoming 'Scooby Doo', thats all I can say - a bad CGI dog, Buffy in a red wig and Freddie Prinze Jr - a guaranteed box office disaster.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
203,pain93,"Fun and eye appealing, but that doesn't save it from being typical.",7,5 May 2008,"Plot-Four teens (Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillipe and Freddie Prince JR.) accidentally hit a local man on a winding ocean side road after a night of partying and fun. They dump the body and decide to never speak of it again...but the past doesn't stay buried as one year later a mysterious killer dressed in a slicker begins to kill them off one by one looking for more than an apology...Thoughts-'I Know What You Did Last Summer' isn't a great film, but it's not terrible. I think the problem is that while it's fun and entertaining it has lots of cliché's and what I call 'Dawson's Creek' dialogue, which makes it sometimes play out like an after school special. But there are some good moments the film has to offer such as a breath taking opening shot of the ocean and cliffs around it, a very good chase scene involving the lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar, and a good and attractive cast, and some good atmosphere. Yet sadly,it plays out in the typical slasher formula making a predictable film. We've seen most of this done before. Director Jim Gillespie could have treated the viewer to a bit more gore instead of not that bloody deaths. You get a nice good chase scene with Sarah Michelle Gellar but then we come to the ending sequence, which was really cliché.Really, in all honesty, it's no where near as good as 'Scream' or 'Halloween' but it proves to be an entertaining film, despite some of the draw backs. It's not great, so I might as well say it, it's a guilty pleasure of mine, but I'm not guaranteeing you'll like it. I think most will find it average or below average, because as much as I find it entertaining and eye catchy, it is average or below.Overall, worth a watch, recommended if you like teen slashers. However, if your a die hard horror fan this may not be for you.My personal rating-7/10The rating it probably deserves-4 or 5/10",I Know What You Did Last Summer
204,Lori_ruelo,Greetings from SCREAM!,3,23 June 2019,"A malheur turns on a man. Through their desperation, by the murder of the foreign man, the group unceremoniously sinks the corpse into the nearby lake. Exactly a year later, a mysterious man emerges, with a hook on his hand targeting the group.
This is the starting point of this teenage mangod. You can already tell here that the screenwriter Kevin Williamson had the pen in the game. A masked killer, attractive teenager and nervous jolle because you can't trust anyone. The film is uninspired and doesn't lend anything new to the story. The film goes under the genre of horror. But more than a thriller, it really isn't.
Most beautiful here, of course, is Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar. The two have been given a starting gun for this in their careers: Love Hewitt can suddenly see ghosts through the attacks of the mask killers, and Gellar becomes a vampire killer after the psychos ' attacks. Ryan Phillippe, though, can score the most on this film: With his playing as a macho before a nervous breakdown, he plays best here.
Verdict: Ordinary teen Klamauk, who is nothing special. The film tries on the classic SCREAM! He fails to achieve that.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
205,EllisDee,"Call it ""Scream Lite"" instead",5,4 October 1998,"""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" hardly qualifies as a true horror film. While it doesn't resort to anything mystical, it simply isn't very scary, which is unfortunate because it tries to sell itself as a horror film.  It also had seemed to be banking on the theory that the appeal of popular actresses from popular TV shows should carry the movie, even if it isn't as scary as it tries to be.  If Neve Campbell worked out just fine in ""Scream,"" why not get Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar to bring in the audience? (never mind whether or not the movie truly passes as scary) Actually, the scariest thing about this movie is that the theory appears to hold true, and, like a popcorn machine gone awry, Hollywood seems to be spitting out these watered-down ""horror"" movies left and right.  Hopefully by the time they get around to making ""I Know What You Did Last Winter,"" they would have taken notes from truly disturbing movies like ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" ""Seven,"" and the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""",I Know What You Did Last Summer

A year later each one of them receive notes stating the somebody knows what they did last summer and as seemingly harmless jokes turn into bloody murder they have to figure out who could've seen them that night and maybe the man they hit didn't die and he's back for bloody revenge.What a film! I remember I was at Hollywood and I had to chose between this movie and Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter so I picked this movie and as I pulled out of the parking lot I felt I had picked a dud so I put off watching this for a while and then one morning I decided to check it out and stuck it into by DVD player. From the first shot to the last shot this film is beautifully shot and directed. You get to know the characters and feel like you want to reach into your T.V. set and pluck the characters out of harms way and a lot of that is due the performances of the actors. Jennifer Love Hewitt was the perfect choice to play the heroin and Sarah Michelle Gellar delivers a heart wrenching performance and the audience really gets to know her more than the rest of the cast mostly to Mrs. Gellar's talent. Which brings up Sarah's chase scene. Words cannot describe the shear terror eating away at your body as Mrs. Gellar runs for her life from the killer. The director did an outstanding job with this sequence and it goes down in Chase Scene Hall as number 1. Remember the chase scene in Prom Night? Expect that and much, much more and you will be no doubt satisfied. Freddie Prinze Jr. is likable as Jennifer Love Hewitt's character's boyfriend and serves as a great red herring twisted around into s great fake reveal and Ryan Phillipe proves he can make the most unlikeable character likable and you can feel for him when he meets his demise. The rest of the cast are great and are there for fodder or red herrings. The only thing I have to say now is if you haven't seen this go check it out and you will now be disappointed.

212,Tremor,The Book Is Always Better,6,26 November 1998,"Anyone who is a REAL fan of the slasher genre should skip this film...but read the excellent teen novel ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" by Lois Duncan. In the book (and this is where the film misses the boat),four teens are involved in a hit-and-run accident in which they kill a LITTLE BOY,not a deranged fisherman with a hook (another imitation of FRIDAY THE 13TH's Jason).The screenplay (which,much to my disappointment),was written by the usually brilliant Kevin Williamson of ""Scream"" fame. The hit-and-run accident would much more poignant if the victim would have been synonymous with the character in the book. Williamson is an obvious fan of the classic ""Prom Night"", in which the victim (in a ""six years earlier"" prologue) was a 10-year-old girl. He should have copied that formula instead of the tired,bloody nameless,faceless JASON-FREDDY-MICHAEL formula. Of the actors,only Sarah Michelle Gellar,Johnny Galecki and Anne Heche save the film from an F rating. Ryan Phillippe,a major talent,wildly overacts here as Barry,and Freddy Prinze,Jr.,who showed promise in THE HOUSE OF YES,does the opposite and underacts with little to no emotion as Ray. Jennifer Love Hewitt is merely adequate as the lead character,Julie James. She and Neve Campbell are NOWHERE near Jamie Lee Curtis's league. This is an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of ""Scream"". Movies like this,and their even more disgusting sequels,are what killed the slasher genre in the early 80's. They will no doubt kill it again before the Millennium arrives",I Know What You Did Last Summer
213,mmc123,Great slasher.,10,29 January 2000,I wasn't around for 80's slasher fare but the 90's slashers are appearing to be quite respectful.  Scream surprised me and so did this gem.  Maybe because I was so hyped to see this movie.  The rewatch value is great. The killer is the Jason Voorhees of the nineties and you don't find out who he/she is until the final few minutes and you discover the motive.  They are after the four who accidentally murdered someone the year before and he/she is out for revenge by getting them back for the murder.,I Know What You Did Last Summer

This movie might have been better if they had the actors read lines instead of sending in modeling portfolios.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is a beautiful face but her acting definitely needs to stay on TV. Same with Hewitt.  The male side of the cast isn't much better.  Out of all the horror movies that came out hoping to cash in on the success of Scream this was the worst.First of all, I never really cared what happened to the kids in this.  In fact they reminded me of those clique-minded, air head snobs I knew back in high school.  I was pulling for the man with the hook.  The murders were not all that interesting and the relationships between the characters were not that strong. I didn't care if the lead characters stayed together, I didn't care if Gellar and Hewitt stayed friends and I definitely did not care if they stayed alive.This just was not a good horror movie.  It wasn't even a good bad horror movie.  If I am going to watched a bunch of mindless teens get hacked, Night of The Demons did it better.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

With a cast of talented actors: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Anne Heche. The idea of mixing an urban legend in with the story of four high school graduates who are keeping a secret of a fatal accident they were involved in (loosely based on Lois Duncan's novella of the same name)is an idea that is both good and clever. The film mostly avoids typical horror films which just revolve around sex, drugs, and excessive gore. It does however include one of the best chase scenes ever to be filmed in a horror movie. Although the main idea is not original and has been used as the plot for other horror films such as ""Prom Night"", it still works.

While driving down a winding road on there way home from said party they accidentally run down a man who, for no apparent reason, is wandering across the road. They assume he's dead, which is their first mistake. Due to circumstances they elect not to report this to the authorities. Their second, slightly larger, mistake was deciding to dump the body into the ocean. One year later the four friends begin to receive certain ""signs"" that the man they dumped into the ocean may have survived.Kevin Williamson mocked the Slasher genre in ""Scream"". This time he uses the classic Slasher formula; rules and all. Okay, so he does add a little to it by keeping the killer's identity secret, but including a bit of mystery isn't enough to revive the tired old formula.There is neither suspense nor terror to be found here. This can partly be blamed on Williamson for the predictable scenario's, but most of the blame lies on director Jim Gillespie. Although he does manage a few jump-out-of-your-seat moments, there's not much else. The scene where Hewitt is trapped in the police car is telegraphed a mile in advance. The scene immediately following this(inside the store) isn't bad, but it's too short, as is the problem with the other chase sequences. They all end much too quickly. Another flaw is that we always know where the killer is. Gillespie tries to keep him hidden in the store with all the other figures covered in plastic, but there aren't enough others. It ends up being that the only truly effective scenes in this film are the false scares(the locker room).Some people assume that ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" has been created to cash in on the surprise success of ""Scream"".

The shocks were effeciently staged, as were the murders, but the plot was far too strained to maintain realism, while the acting was confused; neither actor seems to know how to portray their character, least of all Freddie Prinze Jr., whose entire performance is based on frowning and trying to look deep in thought. It's no wonder how he became an actor  (his father is, after all, Freddie Prinze), but he could have used a few acting lessons.  He's the teen set's equivalent to Keanu Reeves.

I think ozzy should make a horror movie because it would be better than this. I think the main problem lies in the generation gap people who were kids in the late 70s or early 80s got to see horror in its prime, then the audience wasn't so much targeted at teenagers like they are now.

Maybe my problem is i watched them too close together to like this movie. That i was comparing it to scream.  This didn't have the humor that scream did. Didn't have the innocent characters except for the guy from Rosanne, what was the point in him dying?   all it had going for it was a couple of hot young up and coming TV stars.  and they made the mistake of killing one of them off.  Not that i'm sexist and wanted both girls to live because they are hot (well ok that is part of it) but if you had to have two live that would be my pick.

This movie released at a time when slasher films became very popular in the late nighties. This was also the time when teenagers could actually act and not come across too fake. This film brings back a lot of nostalgia. The film has some great cinematography and background music that suits the theme of the movie. Despite it being loosely based on the 1973 novel of the same name, it still manages to come across as a decent movie with a genuine feel.

228,Gen S2rt,Deserves much more credit than it got,10,23 December 1998,"The reason many people didn't like ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was because it came out not long after ""Scream"" (1996).  Some people saw it expecting something much more similar to ""Scream"" than this was.  Other people felt that this was just a knock-off of ""Scream"", trying to cash in on it.  I will admit that it is possible that this is true to an extent, but it was written by Kevin Williamson (the same person who wrote ""Scream"".) Besides, most people didn't accuse ""Scream 2"" (1997) of doing that, and that was a standard sequel (Not continuing the story, just repeating it.)  I thought ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was made well enough to rival ""Scream"".  It had an elaborate back-story which I found very interesting. The group of kids who had to deal with being responsible for someone's death added realistic emotion to the movie.  And for those slasher/horror fans, who are by now getting bored with this review, the blood in this movie was not the most abundant I've seen, but more realistic than anything else.  If you've already seen it, remember when it is sprayed across the glass?  I've never seen any moment in any movie where the blood was so realistic.  The acting was also very good, in my opinion.  Jennifer Love Hewitt did a convincing performance as someone who had been through all she had.  One thing I don't get is how many people thought it was very predictable.  They apparently weren't paying attention to the plot twist toward the end of the movie.  Although the ending of the movie was not in the book, and although it was probably included for the sequel opportunity only, the way it ended was perfect for a horror movie.  Not to give anything away, but that's a type of ending you won't find in too many other movies.  That was perfect, and should have been left just the way it was.  However, it was ruined by the fact that a sequel was made.  Of all the horror movies that were made starting with ""Scream"", this was the one I liked the most, and its sequel was the one I liked the least, by far.  In fact, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" (1998) was so bad that not only was it a bad movie, but it was so bad that it completely ruined the first movie.  Don't see that one, or even recognize its existence.  If you want further details, I reviewed it. As for ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", it gets a perfect 10.

It may not be as scary as ""Scream"", I'll give you that, but it was definitely creepier.

I don't know how many times I jumped out of my seat in the theater.  Okay, the movie is about four teens who have a perfect future ahead of them.  Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) wins the Croaker Queen, a local pageant, and the four friends celebrate and drink beer.  On the drive home, they hit someone, and not wanting to ruin their perfect futures, they decide to dump the body in the ocean, even though the dead guy is still alive and gives the friends a scare.  Cut to a year later, when Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) goes home for the summer where a note awaits her with the title of the movie written on it.  She shows the three other friends, and they soon become paranoid as the fisherman with the huge hook stalks each one of them and gives each a scare.  This movie actually makes you feel for the characters, because we see them in the beginning all bright and happy, awaiting the college life.

Just a standard teen slasher movie -- absolutely nothing new. Not scary, but stupid and annoying. A lot things didn't make sense and the climax was terrible. Not a good movie. I'm really getting sick of those highly popular party horror flicks.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
233,makotoshintaro,Scream Kings and Queens,7,17 September 2017,"I still remember going to the movies in 1997 and expecting to see a comedy instead of a horror movie. The title for some reason made me think it was all about teenage comedy. It turned out it was something better than that and one of my favour horror movies as a teenager. All the characters do whatever they can in order for the viewer to dislike them: Ryan Phillippe is the rich alpha male who just tells everyone what to do and always have a temper, Freddie Prinze Jr.'s constant puppy eyes are more than enough and Jennifer Love Hewitt unreasonable sweet-girl-turned-bitch attitude. That leaves Sarah Michelle Gellar whom I consider the real star of the movie and the most likable one. She's a true Scream Queen. She had definitely the best scenes than the other three main characters and she proved to be the most ""tortured"" one. Plus, she had a lot better scream than Jennifer Love Hewitt... The non-stop plot twists, the mystery covering the killer's identity, Anne Heche's Missy and of course the movie's score are some things that should be mentioned as well. It is a teen slasher classic which along with Scream started the teen slash wave.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
234,movieboy-6,One of the best horror films ever!,10,8 January 1999,"People say that ""I Know..."" tried and failed to surpass the teen-slasher standard set by ""Scream"".  I don't see this at all; this movie was incredible.  Many don't think that there were enough thrills; I beg to differ.  I jumped out of my seat when the guy leaped for Gellar in the department store; and when she turned around in the alley, only to find him standing behind her:  beautiful work!!  Gellar's hair and Hewitt's car trunk also gave an overwhelming sense of erieness.  But that was nothing compared to the make-me-s***-my-pants ending with Hewitt in the shower room; I literally dropped my popcorn in shock.  But what most people didn't understand was that most of the scares were in the idea that the whole thing could happen to anyone.  They were ordinary kids and one mistake haunted them to the grave.  The characters were extremely well developed, the plot was wonderful, and every member of the cast, especially Hewitt, gave a brilliant performance.  A+",I Know What You Did Last Summer

Basically this isn't substantial enough to maintain a concentration span that should last throughout the film.

237,so_original,"Had Potential, But Fell Short",5,21 May 2008,"In the wake of the incredible success of ""Scream"", writer Kevin Williamson decided to craft another teen slasher film, this one called ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". The film revolves around four teen best friends Julie, Ray, Barry, and Helen (Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Ryan Phillippe, and Sarah Michelle Gellar) who are involved in a hit-and-run on the 4th of July. When they run over the pedestrian on the road, they ditch the body to protect their futures. A year later, when they reunite over the summer, they all must face the secret they hid last year. Because someone knows what they did and is out for revenge.When thinking about it, it is surprising that the writer of this film was the same one who wrote the wildly creative and suspenseful ""Scream"". In all fairness, ""I Know.."" is more of an adaption than an original screenplay. It is actually based off the book of the same name. I've read that book, and it was an awkward translation into a horror film, considering the book is actually quite different and more of a morality tale. In the book, the characters are stalked by the mystery man, but none of them are ever killed or even threatened with death. Honestly, this book was not supposed to be made into a horror film. Kevin Williamson is very talented, but I think he cares more about the ""Scream"" series (especially since ""Scream 2"" was released the same year as this film) and got lazy.Another reason why ""IKWYDLS"" didn't work was the lead actors, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. To be fair, Hewitt isn't the worst actress ever. She's had a few good roles, but is more eye candy than leading heroine. It seems like she's more suited to comedy, because she stumbles at times in this film and doesn't make enough of a emotional connection with the role to make us root for her. While she isn't winning any Oscars soon, she's better at acting than Prinze Jr., who is most of the time very stiff and forced (which ultimately effects he and Hewitt's on-screen chemistry). Every time he came on screen was cringe-worthy, and while he's very good looking, he was unfit to be the lead male.Ryan Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar, however, do a very good job with their supporting roles. As an on-screen couple, they have good chemistry and rapport (which they proved 2 years later in the edgy film ""Cruel Intentions""). Also, they stand well on their own. Ray is somewhat of an arrogant asshole, and Phillippe plays him very well. Gellar manages to make her role as beauty queen with the shattered dream Helen also believable, and her chase scene with the killer is arguably the best part of the film. One has to wonder if the film would have been different and more enjoyable if Phillippe and Gellar were cast as the leads, and Hewitt and Prinze were given less screen time.All in all, it's not the worst horror film I've ever seen(that title belongs to 1999's ""The Haunting""). You might even managed to be entertained if you can turn off your brain for awhile, ignore some of the glaring plot holes, and sit through Jennifer and Freddie's awkward acting. However, in terms of horror films, there are plenty of better ones out there.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

One year later, they break the promise - for a good reason. It seems that someone knew what they did last summer and is out to get them. So they all get killed off, one by one. It's formulatic stuff, poorly executed formulatic stuff. There is no thrills, I'm not scared at any point in the movie, for a horror - that is sad. No one in the cast gave a truly memorable performance, so it is truly a poor film. I'll admit that I liked the ending, the only true saving grace of this movie.

I thought the killer was very reminiscent of Candyman because of the hook.  I really enjoy Kevin's chase scenes, but the movie just dosen't stand-up to what I had expected after 'Scream'.  I thought this movie was more serious than 'Scream but it lacked a solid plot. For example, what happened to the crabs and the body in the trunk of Hewitt's car?  And why did the killer bump-off the kid in the fishing yard. If he was left to live it would have appeared that he was the killer, but for some unknown reason he was killed off.  Kevin is a cleaver writer esp. when he borrows from such movies as Halloween, compare the chase scene with Sarah Michelle Gellar running to the store from the walking killer Fisherman, and she can't get in because the door is locked, it is the same scene where young Jamie Lee Curtis is running from a walking/stalking Micheal Myers in the first Halloween...Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it but I expected way more from Kevin Williamson.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

I was actually pleasantly surprised, but that is given that I expected utter crap. Sure, the film is neither scary nor exciting, but it is pretty entertaining nonetheless. It's well shot, and the music isn't as annoying as in the ""Scream"" films, for instance. The actors are surprisingly well cast and GASP!, the characters are somewhat developed! In a contemporary mainstream horror film? WHOA! Despite that it's fairly easy to figure out who gets killed in advance, even though figuring out who the killer is might be a little trickier.

Not out of fear, if anything scared me, I was afraid that this would be Dawson's Creek with serial killers and on a personal note that is scarier that ANY horror movie icon could ever be, but I digress, let's get to it.Basic Story Guide (contains a few spoilers) After attending a beauty pageant, Julie James, Helen Shivers, Ray Bronson, and Barry Cox, are driving home after celebrating their last year together. As Barry's drink falls on Ray (who is driving), they all hear a THUD! the sound of a high velocity impact. Upon inspecting the car, and suspecting that it may have been an animal, Julie makes a horrifying discovery: a boot. A few feet away, they find the mutilated remains of a man. After debating on going to the police, the four decide that the best course of action is to dump the man in the river, and NEVER speaking of this again.One year later, Julie receives a message that only contains seven words: ""I know what you did last summer.""Before I give you the verdict I will say this, I am fan of 90's slashers and 90's horror movies. The Craft, The Faculity, Sleepy Hollow, Urban Legend, Scream even Scary Movie (a parody of 90's slasher movies so I love it), etc. So my opinion of this maybe a little bias but I will give you my honest opinion from how I feel about it.Verdict: Other than a few plot holes and numerous clichés, over all it's a solid 90's horror movie. Well acted, and good energy between four main characters. Descent tension but a little weak on scares. And it contains one the best chase scenes. Sarah Michelle Geller sells it well.Overall 7/10",I Know What You Did Last Summer

244,Disarmed-Doll-Parts,What a terrible film...,3,3 February 2007,"I'm a big horror movie fan, so when I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is claimed to be the ultimate in horror, or even top ten horrors of the nineties, I tend to dry-heave. This film is on of the most boring, stupid, generic and incoherent slashers I've ever seen. I'm not a big slasher fan, sure I love the HALLOWEENs, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET's, BLACK Christmas is in my top five horrors of all-time, but generally slashers annoy me. The characters are one-dimensional and contrived, the acting is terrible, there's hardly any tension, and IKWYDLS is all that, with a crappy title.When going into IKWYDLS, think of it like this. The plot of PROM NIGHT, the atmosphere (or lack of) of SCREAM, the stupidity of MY BLOODY VALENTINE, and the creativity of a bar of soap. Jennifer love Hewitt's character Julie manages to be the most annoying, self-involved character in a slasher I've ever had the misfortune of watching. She plods along with her massive ass in skin-tight trackies, whines about how everyone is terrible except her, and gets people murdered. Freddy Prinze Junior's Ray is just as annoying and obsessed with Julie, almost as much as Julie herself is.One thing this movie has going for it is Sarah Michelle Gellar, and her terrific and easy to relate to character Helen is the redeeming quality of the film, bumping the score up to a 3/10. Helen reminds me of BLACK Christmas' Barb, played by the talented Margot Kidder. Now that I mention it, Sarah Michelle Gellar is shaping up to be a young Margot Kidder, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER proved Gellar's talents, let's just hope she starts choosing some better roles than crappy horror remakes, rip-offs and sequels. Helen's chase scene in the film had me on the edge of my seat, screaming at her to get away, even though I knew she wouldn't That is a good thing for this movie, the feeling of dread Helen felt really shone through to me, and hopefully the rest of the audiences.It's a pity selfless Helen was the only person in the entire film that was likable. Barry, Helen's macho boyfriend played by the talented Ryan Phillipe, was also incredibly unlikeable, but I think hack screenwriter Kevin Williamson (SCREAM, THE FACULTY) intended that. Helen's sister Elsa was a bitch, but so unrealistically nasty. Like she really really hated Helen, not just being a bitchy sister. I'm sure if Elsa was the one to find Helen's frozen body, she'd react just like Julie did: ""I'm scared for my life, don't care about Helen's"". Missy the hillbilly loner, played by Anne Heche was annoying, and totally unnecessary, but I guess she extended the running time.The script was awful. Absolutely dreadful. Kevin Williamson ditches the snappy references to other slasher (well somewhat) and replaces them with terrible lines like ""Is the dried-out, washed-up has-been having a moment?"" from Elsa to Helen (told you she was a nasty hoe) and ""Guys... Hi... I'm on sexist overload as it is, kill the commentary."" from Julie. Gee Julie, don't be happy your best friend is pursuing her dream!! That would be way too selfless, as if you're not selfless enough! In closing, With a few dashes of good, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a sub-standard slasher. If you wanna see a great slasher, check out BLACK Christmas, HALOWEEN and HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME. If you want a movie that you will be screaming at the TV not telling the people to run from harms way, but straight to the killer as they're so annoying, check out I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.3/10",I Know What You Did Last Summer

Also, the plot includes several elements that don't make sense when you think about them afterwards, but are shoehorned in.To be fair, this is scary in parts, but this is fairly average.

The murder scenes are all very well orchestrated with fitting music and there is always suspense present, the Helen Shivers chase scene stood out in particular and not just for Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance. The music and lighting was well done and it was one of the best chase scenes I have ever seen in a movie! I did think however that the scene at the end on the boat failed to keep up the pace of the Helen Shivers chase and Jenifer Love Hewitts's screaming was ridiculous.

It's also one of the least inspired and most bland featuring a mostly charmless cast and a pedestrian script.In a tale as old as time, a group of drunken teenagers accidentally hit a man while driving back from a July 4th party and they decide to dump his body in the river and pretend like nothing ever happened. A year passes and everyone begins to receive threatening letters from an unidentified source. It doesn't take long before the bodies start to pile up as a psycho dressed as a fisherman begins killing them one by one.Loosely based on the novel by Lois Duncan, I Know What You Did Last Summer is a handsomely shot, mostly empty experience that always seems to focus on the wrong things. While mostly an ensemble, our main leads are made out to be Julie and Ray - two of the dullest, most milquetoast characters you're likely to ever see. I can't tell if it's the fault of the script or the actors (having seeing Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze, Jr. elsewhere, I'd say it's more of a scripting issue), but it ends up burying the film's most interesting character, Helen (a wonderful Sarah Michelle Gellar) into a more supporting category. Helen's fall from New York-bound beauty queen to slumming it in her family's small town department store is far more interesting than the jittery Julie who seems like she's about to crawl into a ball and start eating her hair at any moment.Thankfully, it is Helen who gets the film's best moment - an extended chase around the town and department store towards the film's finale.

But we all know who thank especially, Lois Duncan for professionally writing a witty book that would inspire another young writer to give it a twist! Helen's chase scene, 10-10! You go girl! Jeniffer Love Hewwit's character was very Sidney Presscot! Kevin has a thing for bringing that kind of emotion to a main character! People adore that in a movie, this teen slasher flick has inspired others as well. Sure first it was all Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street before but now teen slashers are BIG! We can thank Kevin for that! Sarah Michelle Gellar's chase scene brought many other blonde chase scenes to the big screen! Jeniffer Love Hewitt's character is a step up from Neve Campbell's character in Scream! I Know What you Did Last Summer is the best of them all! You should definitely see it!",I Know What You Did Last Summer
264,film_maniac2500,An Amazing Film,9,20 December 2005,"===Warning May Contain A Small Spoiler===""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" tells the story of four teens who makea brutal mistake to cover up the truth. Julie, Ray, Helen, and Barry are four friends who have just finished high school. On their way to starting their successful careers, the friends drive down to a beach for one last night of fun. However on the way home, they hit a man. An argument occurs on what they should do and Barry convinces the others despite Julie's pleas to dump the body. One year later, Julie who has been failing school and is having a really hard time comes home to Southport for her summer vacation. Once home she receives a letter with no return address, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". Fearing the worst, Julie tracks down Barry, Ray, and Helen only to learn that there futures were trashed as well. What first seems like a joke soon turns into a deadly game of life and death with the four friends caught in the middle of it.The four main characters are played brilliantly especially Sarah Michelle Gellar as Helen. All in all, a great modern slasher flick which in my opinion ties with Scream as the best modern day slasher flick available. So rent it, you will not regret it.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

It didn't have enough cliches. It didn't make you care for the characters. It didn't keep you in suspense about who the killer was.

Sarah Michelle Gellar who played Helen shivers was absolutely brilliant in her part she made you very convinced on the plot and certain aspects of her character she made you believe that all this stuff was happening to her. the plot and screenplay (by Kevin Williamson who also did scream) is very understanding, 4 teenagers basically hit a man and cover it up but then one year later on the following July 4th he takes his revenge out on all of them killing two of them (i wont mention them just in case). but in other ways a great and brilliant film: sleepy Luke",I Know What You Did Last Summer

Julia James is as down below Sidney Prescott as Jennifer Love Hewitt is below Neve Campbell, and that is way, way below. Neve Campbell has a talent that will still surprise many people, and Hewitt is not even close to that.

For the most part, it's an excellent movie.  The ending comes up a little short though, disappointing most who were playing the ""who's the murderer?"" guessing game throughout the movie.  Still, it left me scared as I left the theater, and kept me coming back for more. Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Ryan Phillippe all do a very good job in their roles.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. is another story altogether.  His acting really needed a lot of work in this one, as his performance was clearly outdone by the rest of the cast.  Still, his role fit in well with the movie and his bad job of acting didn't detract that much. All in all, I give I Know What You Did Last Summer an 8.

However, the film does work for what it is: a shallow teen slasher film that serves the sole purpose of entertainment.I'll admit, the film is quite flawed. It suffers from clichés, annoying characters, and delivers absolutely no scares at all. And yes, the film does mimic other, better horror movies such as Halloween (1978) and Scream (1996). However, despite theses flaws, the film can still be enjoyed by any horror fan for pure entertainment.

Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillepe I think did the best and there death scenes do go down in history to be later spoofed in Scary Movie showing that they are recognized. Jennifer Love and Freddie Prinze Jr. do surprisingly well in my opinion It had its boring moments Il admit especially the fight scene on the boat which could have been better.

279,oldsaurora,"A Great Suspense, Not Horror, Flick",7,28 April 2003,"I for one can't understand all the people who bash this movie.  Perhaps they had expected something different?  On the surface it seems that most of the people who hate this movie are (cynical) horror fans, and maybe I Know doesn't live up to certain horror standards.  Personally, I don't watch too many horror flicks so I have no preconceived notions going in.  In any event, I think this movie seems to fit very neatly into the suspense genre, and as such it does a fine job.I thought the acting was at the very least adequate all around.  Hewitt's character (James) was the best.  She was the smartest of the bunch and really the only one who exhibited any remorse, and as such had a depth the others lacked.  Phillippe (Cox) also did a fine job portraying the other extreme.  Both actors seemed to exhibit the emotions you'd expect from someone faced with such a difficult situation.  Gellar (Shivers) and Prinze Jr. (Bronson) were a little bland considering the circumstances.**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!**The story was solid in most places.  It did fall apart a few times though. First, the situation called for the four main characters to stick together, yet many times it seemed that they wanted to have nothing to do with each other.  When four people share a secret that they can't possibly tell anyone else, and when that secret is on the verge of ruining their lives, you'd expect they would lean on each other A LOT.  Furthermore, being alone is not something I'd even consider if I had some psycho after me, and yet many times each of them would venture off by themselves.  Once the very first attack occurred (I think it was the car scene with Phillippe) the four should have really begun to lean on each other.  To some extent they did, but not enough.  Second is the famous crabs and dead guy in the trunk scene. How could the killer remove the evidence so fast and not be seen?  Third, when Prinze told the others that he had also received a letter, why did they not ask to see it?  Certainly at that point I wanted to know what was in that letter, and you'd think they would too.  And lastly, the ending was just flat out terrible as we all wanted the story resolved but it only raised a bunch of new questions.  That's just aggravating.To address a couple of points others have raised.  First, about the villain not being scary enough - maybe you want something over the top, but on the whole the story was realistic and the villain fit that mold. Doesn't bother me as I'd rather have realism.  And second, the comment that it wasn't scary when Gellar's hair was cut.  I think you have to imagine how scared you'd be if you woke up and realized the guy who is stalking you was just in your bedroom as you slept.  At that point the killer was not out to kill, he was out to scare them and mess with their minds.  As such I think this was a very effective scene.To enjoy I Know, you have to appreciate the dilemma these four faced and the inherent fear and suspense within it.  If you do you will be pulling for them, and your adventurous side will want to be one of them just for the thrill of what they are going through and the bonds you'd have with the other three, and when two of them end up dying it really sucks.  Why did the writers have to do THAT!?  If you don't appreciate the dilemma, well then, I think you missed out on what the film has to offer.**END OF SPOILER ALERT!!**Anyways, the aforementioned dilemma is why I feel this is better classified a suspense flick.  The gore factor is pretty low, but the level of mystery, intrigue, and suspense is high.  The feeling of unease is not in the few gory action sequences, but in the fact that the four are stuck in this situation until the killer makes a move, and in the mystery of who is behind things and the uncertainty in what he will do next.8/10",I Know What You Did Last Summer

The movies I can relate to & remind me of my youth have been horror movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer.Barry is the guy you want to be, Ray is the guy you feel like & the girls remind you of the prettiest girls from school.Although this movie at times makes little sense something about it feels like magic to me. It could be the superstar cast, it could be the age I was when I first saw it, it could be Kevin Williamson's fairy dust (most likely it's all of these things).Overall for *most* people this will be an average movie. There isn't much suspense or great death scenes which are key for a good horror movie.

Obviously when it was filmed the script must have looked decent because it pulled in at least 4 famous faces. Either that or there careers needed a revive. they have the totty for the guys, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Love-Hewitt. And not forgetting for the girls there is the devilishly handsome Freddie Prince Junior and Ryan Phillipe.

284,BabyM,Oh please..........!,6,24 July 1999,"Having seen it for the first time at home, when it came to Sky TV, I thanked myself that I didn't waste anytime and money going to the cinema to watch this film.It consists of four young actors who are potentially (or currently are) the big movie stars of Hollywood. They were all such a let down and this film did not serve them justice, but I do give a big thumbs up for Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Love Hewitt's excessive screaming whenever it was (and wasn't) necessary. They must have had classes in that!
I fell in love with Ryan Phillippe in 'Cruel Intentions' in which I thought his and Sarah's acting were better than it was in this film. As I saw Cruel Intentions before this, I was expecting quite a high standard all through but his acting was on an all time low. (well, maybe it wasn't as he was SUPPOSED to be a moron!)Some of the characters were completely irrelevant in the story and were basically used as either innocent stand-by victims of the slasher or a crazy psycho woman living in the country side who likes to play with knives (and cutting up animals)! Anne Heche was probably the best actor in the film overall actually...This film should be viewed by those who enjoy a predictable ending, typical 'running into the path of the killer' scenes and Jennifer Love Hewitt's temperamental hair styles and lively breasts (which probably acted better than she did).To be nice, I'd give this film a 7 out of 10.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

Julie and the gang come back to investigate two minutes later but magically the omnipresent psycho fisherman, apparently aided throughout the movie by otherworldly telepathy, divination and teleportation means, has incredibly restored her trunk to pristine status in a matter of seconds, in a crowded neighborhood and in broad daylight no less. Freddy Krueger himself couldn't have pulled it off. Jennifer Love Hewitt is abysmal at portraying the innocent minded empath ( yet ironically this seems to be her typecast, LOL).

He drives the crucial scenes and plot elements; the film most definitely runs out of puff whenever he's not on screen.

Julie, Ray, Barry and Helen are recent graduates of their local high school, and it is quickly conveyed to us that all of the characters have something great going for them-the beauty, the football star, the brain, and the cute, sweet, sensitive guy who is trying to fit in with the group. So, naturally, this being a horror movie, everything is bound to go wrong sooner rather than later.

A year later they've all tried to move on with their lives, until Julie receives a letter in the mail-""I know what you did last summer.""It's 2010 and when watching this movie you have to recall that it was made in 1997. So expect to see bad clothes, not so great hair, and not so great music. The plot itself holds up really well, and is really engaging. It appeals to the what if sense-that sense that everyone has- this is so far fetched, but what if it happened to me? For a 1997 horror movie, it was really well. There wasn't much blood, meaning you aren't going to get nauseous watching this film. Most of the characters are likable enough, and your heart pounds as you watch the chase scenes.As for a thriller/suspense/horror movie, it was pretty original. Watching this type of movie, you sort of expect to see something unoriginal, something you've seen before. But this movie gives a fresh twist to things, and keeps you guessing till the end.

Some were good... a lot wasn't...Do I really need to summarize the story, I mean, almost everyone know it. The story is about four teens who got an accident and unfortunately killed a man. One year later, they receive strange letter telling them that someone know what they did.The movie create a great and creepy atmosphere that will captivate you until the end and maybe more. It's not just murder from the beginning to the end with a lot of gore. No, it's more psychological. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 9 or 10 years old and today, I'm always scared when I watch it.Another important element is characters. I must admit that at some moment, they can appear a little ""cliché"" but we really care about what will happen and if he or she will survive. A key element in horror movies.What can I add except that the cast is great, specially Sarah Michelle Gellar. A movie that really deserve to be watch. A classic!",I Know What You Did Last Summer

I was flipping channels one night at about 1:00 am and ended up loving it. Im also a big fan of the cast: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze, Jr. , Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Ryan Phillipe.The 4 teens are about to go to college, but their last night together, they spend it on the beach telling ghost stories and making out. On their way home, they run over a man and decide not to call the police, but instead dump the man's body into the river. Exactly on year later, the dead man returns and is out to give the four teens a little pay back.I Know What You Did Last Summer is truly my favorite teen/slasher movie.

(Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddy Prince Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Ryan Phillippe) And of course there is the pretty but more of a book worm, Julie. The queen of the beauty pageant who is obsessed with her hair, Helen. The hot jock-ish jerk boyfriend of the hot beauty queen, Barry. And the hot sweet boyfriend of the smart chick, Ray. Yeah, so they go out to a beach, drink, make out and then hit a guy with their car...sound stupid? Yeah, but it wasn't to me. I first saw this movie on TV when I was 10, and I had trouble sleeping! And I know what your thinking, ""Well yeah, but...you were 10. 10 year olds can get scared really easily..."" NOT ME. I was pretty young when Jurassic Park came out, and I could watch the dinos eat people with my eyes open. On Halloween, my best friend came over and we watched it on TV and laughed at the crappy editing (""Stuff you, man!) and jumped at the thrilling scenes. Yeah, sure the movie can be a bit predictable at times, but the killing scenes were scary and creative as well as the chasing. The plot was good and I don't care what you say. I was surprised when they found out who the killer really was. I highly recommend this movie, it's my favorite.

The beginning was so well directed, the movie IS well directed, and it has descent plot. The acting was so average except for Sarah michelle gellar(Helen). Freddie prince barely acted, jennifer love hewitt OVERACTED, and ryan philippe was just being his character ( like every other movie). The best scene was hands down helen's chase scene, i was literally biting my nails while watching this scene and i am guy. Sarah gellar did an amazing job, she was so believable, and didn't need to exaggerate to deliver unlike her co star jennifer(julie).Overall the movie was really fun to watch and yes i do recommend it.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

312,Jason Michelitch,It might as well be a snuff film.,1,12 April 1999,"It is not enough that we are barraged with an endless parade of dumb films, but that they are continuously as disgusting and frighteningly clear in its mentality as movies as ""I Know..."", is both revolting and telling of the American Viewing Public. The movie is nothing more than a new joining of the ranks of knife-kill flicks, a phenomenon I thought would be long behind us. Of course, with the mass popularity of Scream (a film that, in the process of lampooning these films, became one of them) we have seen a resurgence of popularity in these blood-spattered monstrosities. Now, before I come off as some sort of Moral Majority prick who thinks violence is bad for society, let me clarify: it is not the gore itself that I find disgusting and reprehensible. It is the way that it is used. In the same way that Harlan Ellison speaks of audiences cheering on the decapitation in ""The Omen"", I see audiences squeal with ghoulish delight when the 'bad-guy' finally finds his innocent victim, no doubtedly a well-endowed girl (bringing up the brutality against women aspect of these films, as strong in ""I Know..."" than in any other film) (and yes, I know what you'll say: ""guys were killed too!"" but we were not treated to such deliriously lingering scenes of Ryan Phillipe getting stabbed in a dark alley as we were with Sarah Michelle Gellar, were we?). These films represent the lowest depths of human depravity, they exist merely for the enjoyment of watching someone who is not you get it through the belly. They might as well be snuff films.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

Unfortunately I spent the majority of the movie half asleep with boredom.  The story wasn't very original and to me a lot of the scenes that were supposed to be shocking and/or scary left me saying, ""haven't we seen this before but done much better?"".  Maybe you have to be a teenager to enjoy this brain candy.  I prefer intelligence in my horror movies.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
315,loserking,A great mystery,9,29 October 2000,"For the people who didn't like this film and think it did poorly, you are mistaken.  The film cost a mere $17 million dollars and made almost $80 million domestically.  It was a huge hit.  Anyway, a lot of people compare this to Scream, when it really shouldn't be.  Scream was excellent and I agree is a great, great film, but so is this one.The thing is that I Know What You Did Last Summer was marketed as a teen horror film, when it really wasn't.  It truly is a mystery film.  A lot of deaths were added and were unneccesary, but entertaining.  The film follows a basic mystery outline.  You have a good 20 minute set-up with a crime occuring, then a good hour of rising action, and then a solid 15-minute closing.The direction is top-notch.  The film is set in a small, coastal, fishing town in New England.  There are some great shots.  As for the acting, well good and bad.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is absolutely radiant as Helen Shivers. She really brings a flake, one-dimensional persona to three-dimensional. Her character is the preppy, blonde, good-looking, contest winner, but you can see the pain within her.  As for Jennifer Love Hewitt, she does a pretty good job handling the role.  Ryan Phillippe is good as Barry, but Freddie Prinze, Jr. isn't all that great as Ray.  I think he could of used a bit more inflection.Johnny Galecki is horrible in a supporting role, but Bridgette Wilson is hilarious as Helen's sister, Elsa.  Anne Heche puts in the best performance, even though she's only in two scenes.  She is very freaky and does an excellent job conveying everything.  The script definitely keeps you guessing and the ending IS surprising.I'd reccomend this film to anyone who likes horror and mystery.  Fans of straight horror of straight mystery probably will be slightly disappointed.MY GRADE: 3 (out of 4)",I Know What You Did Last Summer
316,jundorra,Not Like The Book,6,24 June 2006,"""I Know What you did Last Summer"" is a good movie for what it is. I was disappointed that it wasn't like the book. So this is the type of movie where if you are the type of person who reads the book before watching the movie, I wouldn't bother. But, it is a good book except do not expect it to be like the movie. It is a good movie though, my mother would have peed her pants. You see in the book, they run over a little boy, but in the movie they hit a grown man. In the book, I do not remember anyone dieing. The brother of the boy who was killed is the person who threatens them, not the complicated relationships that are in this movie.",I Know What You Did Last Summer
317,UnforgivenSins,An Edge-Of-Your-Seat Horror.,9,25 January 2007,"I had only seen I Know What You Did Last Summer in the past year. I remember faintly being over at my cousin's house, looking at the video covers, and being freaked out. So when this movie came on TV, I thought I should see it. Unfortunately, it came on around 12, and I couldn't stay up to watch it. This didn't leave me, and the next day, I borrowed both I Know and I Still Know from my cousin.To say the least, I was impressed. It had good acting, Jennifer Love Hewitt as the guilty main, who isn't doing that great. Sarah Michelle Gellar as the has-been pageant queen. Ryan Phillippe as the cocky and angry jock. And finally, Freddie Prinze, Jr. as the loner of the group, still too attached on last summer.The plot itself was unique, based off of Lois Duncan's novel of the same name. Granted, most of the movie came from Williamson, Duncan only provided the names of the characters (Helen Rivers was changed to Shivers), and the basic plot. The suspense is great, and there is a VERY low gore rating, which works with this movie. The killer is somewhat creepy, and the movie makes you think it's other killers before the real one is figured out. There was a bit of comedy in it too, mostly from Ryan Phillippe's character.Over all, despite the very FEW flaws, it still deserves a 10 star rating.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

'I Know What You Did Last Summer' would be pretty mild compared to them.Though the only thing that really bothered me was how it was so hard to understand. By the end of the movie I still didn't know who the guy with hook was. I watched it two more times and still did not understand. Hmm... I suppose maybe I'm just bad at following the story lines of movies, but even more friend did not understand the ""hook guy"" was. Some other parts of the movie were a bit unrealistic too. Though I still think it's an okay movie. It's good to watch, I guess it's not something you are supposed to really analyze, because I do that a lot with movies.",I Know What You Did Last Summer

Kevin Williamson, also the writer for Scream, does an excellent job of capturing your attention. Total teen flick, although anyone would enjoy it. The plot is about four best friends who just got out of high school. While they celebrate, they end up in a horrible situation and ends up accidentally killing someone. After they decide to run from their mistake...one year later, they soon realize that someone is stalking them and knows about their last summer.

Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a stunning performance as Helen Shivers the girl who can run but can't hide and Jennifer Love Hewitt as Julie James the smart and mature one who figures it all out in the end. Freddie Prinze j.r is Ray Bronson who is the one left out in almost the hole film but has a big part as the one who knew the secrets and unravelled it all before anyone and was the one who accidentally started the accident because of Ryan Phillippe who plays Barry Cox the bossy big-shot quarter-back who basically started the whole deal with the killer and all that stuff by being drunk. The killer is a big secret who could never be identified but was an obvious killer when thought about. Four Teenagers celebrating the summer holidays and accidentally run down a man while drunk on the road. Not thinking straight they dump the body in the sea and swear to secrecy. 1 year later They have all split up but each individually begin to get letters and then more serious things happen to them which forces them to reunite. Sworn to secrecy, they can't tell anyone what happened but if they are being pushed about by the stalker any longer they are all afraid their secret may be revealed.

Its fun, and entertaining, don't take it to seriously. People who are hard core fans of Horror movies may feel cheated because of the lack of gore, but i still think it is very interesting.

Everyone gave great performances, esp. Sarah Michelle Gellar. On top of that, this movie was frightening. This movie is great and I definitely recommend it. It is definitely a movie you should watch for both entertainment and originality purposes. It is definitely one to see if you enjoyed 'Scream'.

It definitely compares to the classic ""Halloween"". I Know What You Did Last Summer stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze, Jr as teens who hit a man and then dump his body in the water...etc...(i'm not going to start describing the movie because I hate when people do that, because most of you already saw it, or don't want it to be spoiled). This film creates a tension and paranoia like in 1978's ""Halloween"". It has an excellent score and despite what some people say, it is not a ""Scream"" based film. It is a classy, not quarky movie. It also has what I think to be the newest SUCCESSFUL slow-walking/stalking serial killer. You have your terrific Michael Myers, who at the time had been getting bad reviews for Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers (1995), and Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th series had disappeared after the lackluster New Line Cinema film Jason Goes To Hell (1993). So, the Fisherman was a very good relief to have. Much scarier and more intimidating than the Ghostface killer from ""Scream"". I Know What You Did Last Summer is a magnificent, unique and original film that went on to produce a great sequel. I honestly think this might be one of (if not) the best horror films I have ever seen, and I can definitely say that I have seen a lot of movies.

They get so wrapped up in their fear that they fail to do some fairly basic things. It drives me mad that the only thing they can think to do when confronted by a killer with a gun on his hand is run away.The reason they get locked into the situations they do is because they keep running into narrower and narrower situations.

I never expected Oscar caliber performances. although i felt sarah michelle gellar gave one hell of a performance, i was really rooting for her character during that chase scene, and i rarely root for the main characters in slasher films. Anyways everyone already knows the plot and everything, it may seem pretty dull and predictable but it delivers some really good thrills.

I thought that the guys face should have looked more fake when they saw it at the end and also he should have looked more ""used"". the movie was predictable because when the guy lost his hand it was easy to tell that he was gonna have the hook connected in the sequel. the movie needed more things that would make you jump i think. it needed to be more scary by a lot! this movie was not as good as i would have hoped for but not as bad as it sounds it was alittle funny after watching scary movie 1/ it was still agood movie and should be raited at a 9 or a little less then that but it was not as scary and it had in my opinion too many flashfowards. it also needed more main characters. that is why i think the movie was predictable and not scary enough and i am only 12 PATHETIC!",I Know What You Did Last Summer
